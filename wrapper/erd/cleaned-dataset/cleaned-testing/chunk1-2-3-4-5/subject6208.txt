 Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, but I have some vinyls I've gotten from my grandmother and would love to listen to them, but I don't own a record player. I don't even know where to start and what to look for. Can someone help me find a good starter record player for under $150? 




 Okay, so I made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hwb6k/what_are_some_good_movies_to_show_to_a_group_of/) a few days ago looking for help figuring out what movie to watch on our movie night. 

After looking at the comments, and comparing them to the movies I actually own, I've put together a list of seven movies. However, I can't decide which to watch. In the original post, I talked about what my friends liked. "They don't like slow paced movies and would rather not watch a drama unless its interesting and has good pace. They like just about any genre but would prefer either a horror, comedy, action or any combination of those. I think above all though the thing that matters most is if its interesting and has good pacing. I don't want to bore them. I showed them There Will Be Blood once and I could feel the awkward boredom in the room."

The List: Pulp Fiction, Event Horizon, Fight Club, Children of Men, Dredd, Crank, and Se7en.

So which of these would be the best crowd pleaser? The one everyone would be most likely to enjoy? Which is the easiest to get into, no matter what kinds of movies you like? 














 Looking for a great sci-fi horror movie to watch. I love sci-fi but I also want to be horrified, terrified, grossed out, etc

Any ideas? 




 So me and some friends are doing a movie night Friday and I'm trying to figure out what to show. 

A little info on my friends. They don't like slow paced movies and would rather not watch a drama unless its interesting and has good pace. They like just about any genre but would prefer either a horror, comedy, action or any combination of those. I think above all though the thing that matters most is if its interesting and has good pacing. I don't want to bore them. I showed them There Will Be Blood once and I could feel the awkward boredom in the room. 

Also I'd prefer something that didn't come out in the last two years. Thanks guys!

I watched this not knowing what to expect and was immediately drawn in by its animation style. Tells a very interesting story about a selfish morally corrupted man who one day wakes up with wings on his back. I was really amazed by not only the animation but also how it tells this story with no dialogue. It even gets a little Cronenberg-y at some parts. Definitely give it a watch.   




 Lets fantasize for a minute here. Lets say that there is no way it will be bad. That they will get everything right and it will do justice to the original show. That it will without a doubt be great. 

And I'm not talking about a remake of a show. I'm talking about a sort of continuation of the show. I'm talking about something like the Rugrats Movie, Simpsons Movie, Serenity, and Arrested Development. 

So what tv shows would you like to see get a movie? 




 I mean he's so good with creature effects and Pacific Rim sort of reminds me of Power Rangers in a way. Just a thought.  




 For example, I hope Aaron Paul makes the jump to film because he's a great actor that should get more roles.  




 Saw White House Down then I went to a casino and I was wondering what games have levels that take place at a casino or the White House? 




 I really love the Mardi Gras level in Hitman Blood Money. It was probably the first time I saw that many NPCs in one level. 




 What are some really good flying games for this current generation of consoles?

First time posting here. My friend and I decided to challenge ourselves and see what we could come up with in only 24 hours. Would love some feedback. We loved our idea so much that we'd like to make a full length film of it some day so, criticisms, tips, and suggestions are more than welcomed! 




 I'm really interested in seeing this but I can't find out where it's being released at. On my local theaters website they have a list of movies they'll be showing up to middle August but Only God Forgives isn't listed so I'm assuming my local theater isn't showing it. 

Anyone know where it'll be? 









 I'm not talking about a movie being turned into a stage play. What I mean is, what if the movie was shot as a musical.  




 I have some khakis that need altering.  




 I love Nine Inch Nails and think they're great, but even if they weren't great, Nine Inch Nails is such a cool name. 









 Also what items are they? 



















 So my friend got me into World of Tanks and while we were setting it up we started talking about the voice chat in the game, or any pc game in general, and thought it be cool to have some sort of voice modulator software, where whenever we talk, people hear like a delocated, super low voice. For example, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=YlxxxXz4T-s#t=16s)

So my question is, is there any software that can do this?

Again, if this isn't the right place, please tell me where I can ask this, thanks, guys! 




 Loved Just Cause 2 and was wondering if anyone's said anything about it at E3 this year. 




 [Picture](http://imgur.com/yrLLfCQ)

My friend is moving away this week and I wanted to give her a photo of all of us. The problem is that it was taken on an iphone so it's super fuzzy and grainy and the quality isn't that great.

Could someone improve the coloring to make it less yellow and more "natural" looking? Also is it possible to make it clearer or less grainy? Just an overall better looking picture?

I really appreciate any help. We just want our friend to have a nice picture of all of us all.

Edit: Thank you /u/screwball2 and /u/braceyourself87 these are great! I really appreciate it! 




 I'm talking about some not so well known directors that have only done a few movies, or they can even be well known directors that make movies every so often.

My pick is Gaspar Noe. Dude makes great movies, but he's only done a few and hasn't made one since 2009. 




 Me and some friends are going to have a movie night tonight. We want to see something sick and disturbing. Almost all of us, including me, are very squeamish so we thought it'd be fun to be grossed out.

I wanna know what the most disturbing, gruesome and grisly gore you've seen in a movie is. I'm not talking about someone getting shot and blood sprays out. I'm talking head crushing, bone breaking, gut spilling out sort of things. 




 What scene of violence or gore in a movie has made you cringe the hardest? 




 I watched Kill List recently and really liked it. I liked how it starts off pretty standard but as the movie progresses, things start getting darker, stranger, and more evil.

Are there any other good movies that start off pretty standard, but throughout the course of the movie things just get darker, more evil, more insane, stranger, and just all out worse? 

Like the protagonist is totally sane at the start, but throughout the movie he experiences things that get increasingly unsettling, violent, dark, and evil and by the time the movie is over he is a different, emotionally and mentally broken man. Anything like that?

Edit: Requiem for a Dream is a good example of what I'm talking about. 




 I'm looking for some good mature adult graphic novels. But not mature as in violent or gory. Mature as in language and subject matter. Basically an R rated comedy in graphic novel form. Something funny, but also very adult and mature. Anything that fits the bill? 




 I can't remember the title. It was something along the lines of "Getting drunk in front of the movie theater" or something like that? It was about a young adult girl? I read a little bit of this novel a while ago and liked it but don't remember what it was called.  




 I'm looking for some graphic novels to read that are realistic. As in, they're about real, normal people. Not super heroes. Not zombies. Not monsters. Just regular average Joes or average Janes. 

One of my favorite graphic novels is Daytripper. It's about a guy and his life from his childhood all the way to his adulthood. No superheros or supernatural stuff. Just a guy and his experiences in life.

Or some good heist graphic novels, or cop novels, detective novels, war novels, or even just novels about a person or group of people. Basically graphic novels about people who aren't superhuman. They're just like you and me.

As much as I think superheros are cool, I'm just fascinated with human drama. Human interactions. Human problems.

I hope I explained well enough. If you need more details and information about what I'm looking for, just let me know. 




 What are some great graphic novels that aren't well known? 









 Also, what would you do?

I choose link karma instead of comment karma or combining the two because it'd get ridiculously high.

Mine is 1961, so I guess it'd be interesting. 




 It was a post withe the title "Whoever wins this game..." or something like that. It was about a game that drops you into google streetview and you have to make your way to an airport. Tried looking for it but it seems like the post just disappeared. Anyone know where it is or what game it was? 




 When people talk about funniest movies, they tend to talk about movies made in the 20th century. So what do you think are the funniest movies of the 21st century? 




 I'm getting sick of long hair and since it's summer I'm thinking of getting a haircut. But I don't know where to go. I know MHA says to stay away from places like Super Cuts. So where should I go? Salon? Barber? Hair studio? What kind of place is best to get a good stylish and fashionable haircut? 









 It can be a character, too. Just any famous person or character. 




 I was looking for a vinyl of The Fragile and someone mention they heard there was going to be a repress of it? Is this true? If it is, when? And if it is, does this mean I can finally get The Fragile vinyl at a reasonable price?

 I'm working on losing weight. I have a diet set up and I'm starting to run. However, I know that weight lifting is an important part of losing weight and getting in shape. So my question is: As someone who can't afford a gym membership or weights, what is a good substitute for weights? A box of books? What DIY stuff can I bench press or curl? 




 Basically what mom and/or dad from a movie or tv show would be cool to have? Why? You can mix and match mom and dads from any movie or tv show to make awesome combinations of parents if you want.  




 Everybody's bashing the new Xbox talking about, "Oh it looks like a VCR! Hurhur!" But I actually think its kind of sexy. I like the simple sleek design of it. It seems like its built for efficiency. And besides, when it comes down to it, the look of the console is near the bottom of the list of things that matter. 




 What do you consider a must see movie simply because of what they achieve or do on a technical level(music, camera work, sound, cgi, effects, cinematography, etc.)? Regardless of how good you think the movie actually is in terms of acting or writing or story. 

For example, Enter the Void is a movie many would consider bad or boring and not that great. However, I think it's a must see purely because of what they achieve with the camera work and cinematography.

Also, Avatar. Many like it, but there are also many who don't think it's that great and has a bland story and average acting, but I also consider it a must see because of its groundbreaking effects.

So what movies do you think are must sees from a technical standpoint? 




 So yeah. People tell me it's great, but have never told me why. All they say is, "It's great man. Just give it a shot." "What's great about it?" "Just watch it."

So no one as ever really argued for it or given me reasons why I'd like it. I like fantasy stuff. And I appreciate a great story with great characters. But I have a hard time looking past the fact that it's animated and about kids.

But like I said, no one has ever given me reasons why I should watch it and what makes it great. I want to check it out, and I'm open minded,  but I can't convince myself because I know nothing about it. So, change my view. 




 So I've been trying to convince my mother to watch this show for a while now. I know she'd love it because she loves these types of shows. But she won't give it a chance because it's animated and that automatically makes it a "little kids show." So can you guys help me develop an argument to convince her to at least give it a shot? How did you convince someone you know to watch it? 




 Disturbing or terrifying videos/audio recordings are welcomed too. Basically things that just don't sit right with you and you find unsettling. 




 As someone with social anxiety who's also super shy, this situation makes me want to die. 




 I have social anxiety and this situation makes me want to die.  









 It takes me about three months for my facial hair to resemble anything close to a beard. Is there any way to speed this process up? Rogaine on my face? Anything? 



















 Basically a subreddit where people post awesome fan made trailers and mashups. Combining other trailers. Also creating tv show intro mashups. 




 I hate Betty White. But it's not her fault. It's everyone else's fault. She so overrated. Everyone's like "OMG Betty White is the funniest person! She's the greatest! She's so much win! I love her so much!" Honestly she's just humorous. Don't get me wrong, she's a kind person. But I absolutely hate that everyone goes nuts for Betty White. It seems like whenever she's in a movie or show, it's only so the producers can be like, "Look we have Betty White! We're relevant!" 

She's everywhere just for the sake of being everywhere. And her show Off Their Rockers is kind of bad. I guess I don't hate Betty White. She nice and fine. I just hate the absolute over hype about her.  




 Okay so I saw this anime movie a long time ago and I've never seen it again. I have no idea what it was called or what it was about. In fact I didn't even see all of it. I only watched one part and have been wanting to see it ever since.

The scene I saw involved a man and a little girl. There was also a cyborg like woman attacking them. This was in like the near future I believe. So the cyborg woman attacks the man with some sort of hand blade thing. I think. But the man holds up his hand and the blade goes through his hand and stops right at his eye. It was also raining I believe. And this took place within a skyscraper I believe. Please identify this! It's been haunting me for years! 




 I've played a lot of Skyrim. I've seen almost all it has to offer. It's really starting to bore me. What are some ways or challenges I can do to make it interesting again?

Edit: I'm on 360. 




 I'm 19. One friend who works all the time and when he's not working, he's with his girlfriend. So I never hang out with him. 

Weekends suck because I always spend them alone. 

I mean, I have many "friends" but we never hang out. I only have one real friend. I always invite people to stuff but they rarely accept. 

I'm a nice, funny, caring guy. What's wrong? I just want to enjoy my life because I don't know how long I'll be alive, but its hard to enjoy life alone.

I have some friends who frequent Reddit. A few know my username. So if anyone who knows me sees this, don't let me know that you've seen this.

 Thanks for listening, everyone.  









 What song do you think has the best singing you've ever heard? 




 Saw this movie a while ago. Can't remember title for the life of me.  





























 Didn't know where else to put this. I just want to see it get made. The creator has said that The Jungle Movie, the next and final HA! movie, was suppose to be the last movie. It would've answered all sorts of things like what happened to Arnolds parents, what happens between him and Helga amongst wrapping up  the stories of all the other kids. [Here's an interesting article](http://tendraheyarnold.wordpress.com/2009/03/28/confirmed-notes-about-the-jungle-movie/) where Craig Bartlett, the creator, talks about the unmade movie and what would've been in it. 

It saddens me that this might never be made. I just need closure! 




 So what movies have made you cry just out of the sheer beauty of it? I watched To the Wonder tonight and there was one part where I started crying because of how sweet and beautiful it was and all I said was, "It's so beautiful!" as I was crying. 














 My friend asked me if I knew anyone who could photoshop. I don't so I came to you guys. [Here is the pic](http://i.imgur.com/X6vv7ju.jpg) he wants edited. [Here is what he wants edited onto his glasses](http://i.imgur.com/wVvYJtW.jpg) as if it were reflected onto his glasses. Sort of like [this](http://i.imgur.com/pfxg80W.jpg) for example. Thank you so much for your time! 














 First off I wanna say that I don't hate this movie. In fact, I really liked it a lot. However, it didn't meet my expectations. I think it might have been too over hyped.

Before it came out I saw some reviews that said this movie was incredible and it was the bloodiest movie ever made. Now while it WAS bloody, I felt only one scene was super bloody. I was expecting every death to be crazy amounts of blood everywhere. Also, the trailers were absolutely incredible and did and amazing job of hyping me up. And finally the poster. The poster said "The most terrifying movie you will ever experience." That tagline made me believe I was about to see a remarkable piece of horror.

And the movie wasn't really that scary, it was more just violent. I was expecting to not be able to look at any of the deaths, but it was actually pretty easy to watch. I felt more grossed out watching the original Evil Dead. Now, again, I still really liked and enjoyed this movie, but did the marketing over hype this movie? Or was this all my fault because I set my expectations so high?  




 Going camping in a week. I wanna put together a playlist of some good camp fire music. You know some good accoustic stuff. Stuff that sort of have the feel of someone sitting at a camp fire with a guitar playing. Maybe not just accoustic. Maybe some nice mellow stuff. So what do you guys think should be on this playlist?

What I have on the playlist so far to give you guys an idea

Over the rainbow - Israel Kamakawiwo'e

Guaranteed and Society - Eddie Vedder

 Are there any fictional movies like Samsara in terms of cinematography? It's one of the most breath takingly beautiful movies I've ever seen and I'm curious if there are any other movies that aren't documentaries that have similar cinematography or even similar thematic elements.  




 Who decides what commercial to show and when? How do they decide this? Is it random or on a playlist? How do commercials come on automatically?  












































 So I have a lot of money and I wanted to spice my game up by giving my character an overhaul in terms of his looks. The problem is I don't know what to change and how to make him look. I need inspiration. You think you can post a screenshot of your character? Show your character off! Maybe one of your awesome characters will inspire my new character. I'm just not really creative and my character's super generic. Thanks! 



















 Okay so I watched 500 Days of Summer and it kind of reminded me of Blue Valentine in that it was sort of a story about the rise and fall of a relationship told in a nonlinear fashion. I want to see some more movies like this.

So, are there any good movies about the rise and fall of a relationship? Movies where you see the beginning and end of a relationship? It can be about the relationship between husband and wife, girlfriend and boyfriend, between friends, parent and child, etc., any relationship told in either nonlinear or linear fashion. It just really fascinates me to see how a relationship progresses from two people getting to know one another, to loving each other, then to see it start to crumble and eventually fall. Blue Valentine is one of my favorite movies, but it's also one of the saddest I've ever seen. Thanks! 




 So I want to get Operation Flashpoint but don't know which one to get. So simply, which is better(mechanics, gameplay, graphics, difficulty, fun, etc.)? 




 First off, sorry if this post doesn't belong here. If it doesn't, please let me know where to put it, thanks!

I can't decide which show to watch so I came to ask you guys. Basically, which show should I watch? Which is more worth my time watching? Thanks! Note: I haven't seen any of these shows before.

* Arrested Development

* Lost

* Mad Men

* The Killing

* Archer

* Twin Peaks

* Hell on Wheels

* House of Cards

* Bob's Burgers

* Parks and Recreation

* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia 

* Louie

* Alias 




 I'm new here and just wanted to say hi. 









 Okay so I've only played like three quarters of Mass Effect 1 and stopped because my game was messing up so I never went back. Recently I've been wanting to play a Mass Effect game. The only thing stopping me is the fact that I'm like two and a half games behind and don't have that kind of time to play both Mass Effect 2 and 3 on top of finishing the first one.

I listen to a couple of gaming podcasts so I kind of know what happens in all of the Mass Effect games and kind of know what's going on. So I want to get Mass Effect 3. My question is: Is it a good idea to jump in the third one without finishing the first and not playing the second? Will I know what's going on or get lost? Also, should I get ME3 or ME2? I've heard from almost everyone that ME2 is better, but I'll only have time to play one of them so I figured I'd get ME3 because it's the last one. Basically, which one will give me the better experience(better mechanics, story, fun, stuff to do, etc.)? 









 [How does these kinds optical illusions work](http://media.log-in.ru/i/3dstereo_2.jpg)? How are they made? I don't get it. 




 What's your favorite song that was written specifically for a movie?

Mine's probably Down to Earth from Wall-e. Yours doesn't have to be a Disney song, though. 



















 So I was driving and some nut turned in front of me and scared me to death. My heart skipped a beat. Then I thought, what happens in your body when that happens? What causes it? What's going on? 









 Like, if I saw a man who weighed 125 lbs I would think that he looked gross and unhealthy and like a skeleton. However, when you see a woman who weighs 125 lbs she looks healthy and normal? Why do women look different than men who weigh the same?  




 I've been out of high school for almost two years contemplating what to do in terms of education. I've always known what I wanted to do: Film. So after tons of reading and thinking I've decided that I want to be a professor of film. And in my free time I'd work on my film. So my question is what classes did you take to be a professor of your chosen subject? How long did it take? 




 So this documentary is fantastic. It's basically interviews with big filmmakers about digital vs film. Really interesting! Definitely worth your time. 

[Here's the link for it on Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Side_by_Side/70239473?trkid=2361637) 




 Also, who are some actors/actresses that don't deserve all the work they get and should be getting less roles?

My pick for actor that should get more roles: Jared Leto. He's good in everything he's in, but I don't see him enough. Runner up: Ben Foster

My pick for actor who shouldn't be getting as many roles as they do: Adam Sandler. He's a funny guy with good acting chops, but he hasn't made a quality movie in a long time.  









 First off i want to say that if this isn't a good place to post this please tell me a good place to post it. So I play Skyrim on the Xbox and I've put a ton of time into it and have a high ranking character, but eventually I want to get a pc. I wanna add mods to it. However I don't want to have to start from scratch. So my question is, is there any possible way to move my character profile from my Xbox to my pc? Could I import my save somehow or somehow create a fake save? Anything I can do? 









 I've applied at nearly 100 places within the last 4 months. I've been unemployed for about 8 months. I'm about to go to college and need a job, but haven't been able to get one for 8 months despite the fact I apply to multiple places a week. I mean, I don't even get a call. I never hear from the job, so I have no closure about if they even saw my application or not. 

This upsets me because I've been searching for 8 months, however I have friends and family members that got jobs after looking for only a couple of weeks. And we have the same amount of qualifications. What gives? How come the people who actually need and want a job and have been looking forever seem to stay unemployed? And the people who don't need a job, but want one just so they'll have money to buy material objects they don't need seem to get jobs easy? This blows. 




 First off I want to say that I'm not sure if this post belongs here, and if it doesn't, please let me know where it goes, thanks.

So I got a speeding ticket today. Why does this piss me off? Because I've only sped twice in my life counting today. Both times I've gotten a ticket. And both times unintentional. I know a bunch of friends and family that speed on purpose all the time and never once have they gotten pulled over! Why me? This blows! 

Also, I was ONE mile away from my house! 




 Hey guys. I'm pretty new here and have some experience with guns but I have a question. I just bought a used leather holster. It was made for a S W 659 but it will hold any pistol of the same size because it's not specifically molded for the S W. So what are some other pistols the same size and dimensions as the S W 659? Thanks for the help! 









 What are some movies where a person or group of people travel across a country (any country) and they experience the various natural wonders and beauties of mother nature as well as various cultures. And even meet some strange people along the way? Something in the vein of Into the Wild or Wild America? Not a documentary though. An actual movie. 




 I'm looking for movies that are epic, but not epic as in huge. I mean epic as in the movie spans across a vast amount of years. Something in the vein of Bicentennial Man. Or maybe Forrest Gump? 




 What line or quote from any movie or tv show is your favorite? Feel free to post links to videos or pics of the quote. 




 What exactly are electronic cigarettes and what makes the different and healthier than regular cigarettes? 




 There was a game I played a lot in either the late 90s or early 00s. It was an internet based game on a website. I mostly played it in the computer lab. It had to do with a fox I think? It had multiple levels. Each level was a different puzzle I think? One of the levels had you bouncing a bubble with another bubble. You had to keep the bubble in the air and it couldn't touch the ground. Again, it has to do with a fox. I think it might have had the word "fox" in the title or url. Please help! 




 What scene from a movie was serious or not meant to be funny but had you laughing hard? 




 I saw the Fast and Furious 6 trailer during the super bowl and it got me thinking. I remember the first Fast and Furious way back when it was just a small crime movie about an undercover cop in the street racing world of a California city. Now it's evolved into international heist/race action thriller taking place in world locations with huge action. Not that I'm complaining, I just find it interesting how this franchise started as one thing and has changed into something else entirely different. 

So, what other movie franchises or tv shows have started as one thing and turned into something else entirely? For better or worse? 

**EDIT:** I'm no talking about what franchises stated off good and ended up bad. I'm basically saying what franchises or shows have basically changed genres. Example: The Fast and Furious used to be a small crime movie and is now an over the top international action movie.  




 Hey I'm new here, but I love writing. Was wondering what you thought of my short story. Give me some constructive criticism. [It's called NDE](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0By3l0nVnUv1hU0t4aEFRc3pWTVk/edit) It's a working title. 




 Hey guys I'm new here and also started collecting last summer, so I thought I'd post some pics of my collection so far.

1. Memphis/TN/USA

2. August 4

3. Anything mind-bending

4. Probably Charlie's Angels

5. Mission Impossible 2

6. In the Name of the King

7. Either Christopher Nolan, Terrence Malick, or Zack Snyder

8. The Thin Red Line Criterion Collection

9. Kill Bill The Whole Bloody Affair

10. Alphabetical

11. IMDB?

I'm planning on adding to my collection frequently, but here's what I have so far.

[My collection so far.](http://imgur.com/a/6DTiI)  




 I saw the Impossible and it's one of the best movies not only of the year, but in a while. It has incredible effects, acting, and directing. So why is it basically non existent at all these award shows and top ten lists? How come this fantastic film is getting no nominations at practically any award shows and getting hardly any recognition from critics and columnists? I've seen tons of websites and magazines talk about what they think are the best films, but no one mentions the Impossible. What gives? 




 Out of all the years the Oscars has been around, what do you think is the biggest snub in Oscar history? 




 I saw Zero Dark Thirty on Friday and I was thinking this is such an American movie. But, is it the most American movie? Probably not, but what do you guys think is the most American movie ever made? 

Also, if you had to pick a movie to represent America and what America is, what would it be? Like what movie embodies best what America is? Like, if you gave an American film to a foreign person in order to show them what America is really like and what we're all about, what film would that be? 




 Pretty self explanatory. I would love to see a sequel or prequel to the Iron Giant. So, Reddit, what is your pick? Also, what would it be about? 




 Also, what would they be? They can be anything. Your relative, sibling, friend, your dentist, your teacher, local cop, weather man for your local news station, etc., etc.. They can be anything! Anything! 




 Guys, we've already seen posts about what were the best movies of 2012 and the best cinematography and best performances of 2012. But what do you guys think are the best scores of 2012? Or best soundtracks or best original songs of 2012? I really loved the scores for Samsara and Dredd because they really captured the mood and feeling of those films. But what do you guys think are the best? 




 Hey I'm looking for a show. It was a Japanese game show that came on G4 and I loved it. It was a show that had a ton of extremely difficult obstacle courses. One of them was had people unicycling along super thin platforms and hopping upstairs. That's the only obstacle course I can remember right now. Please help! 




 Hey guys. Recently I've had an urge to play a game with good tactical multiplayer. Something along the lines of Spec Ops from Call of Duty(best example I could think of). I want something they relies heavily on tactics, communication, and teamwork in order to win/complete objectives. It can be co-op, online or offline, doesn't matter. Or even player vs player/team vs team. I don't really care what genre it is either so long as it's good tactical multiplayer/co-op. Thanks, guys!

Edit: Preferably console games. I don't have a decent pc. 














 Hey guys and gals. I was playing spec ops: the line and noticed in the settings that you could change the filter on the game to change the look of it. This reminded me of red dead redemption. In RDR, you could change the brightness and contrast and make it as vibrant and colorful as you want, or as desaturated as you want. You could even make it black and white if you so desired. I thought this was an awesome feature as it allowed you to tailor your game to the look and feel that YOU wanted. So my question is are there any other games for consoles that allow you to change/adjust the color/contrast/look of the game?  




 Hey everyone! Listen, I'm pretty new to photography so I need some help looking for a good wide angle lens. I have a Canon EOS Rebel T3i. My budget is preferably no more than $150 and the most I'll absolutely go is $200. Also, how reliable is ebay for buying lenses? Thanks for all the help! 




 I was wondering if you guys can suggest a movie that will make me cry. I'm a guy and I've seen a lot of movies, but none have made me cry. I hear people all the time talking about a movie they saw that made them cry, and I want to experience that. I want to see a movie that affects me so much on a personal/mental/emotional level that it makes me cry. I don't really know why I want to experience this other than the fact that I haven't ever experienced it. There are a few movies though that have brought me close to tears such as Requiem for a Dream and Lion King. I would say it takes a lot to make me cry. I mean I cried when my golden retriever died and I cried when my grandparents died, but that's basically it. A friends son past away recently and I didn't even cry (I don't mean that in a proud way). I mean sure I was sad, but I didn't cry. So I think it has to affect me on a personal level. So can you guys suggest a movie so incredibly sad and depressing that if it doesn't make me cry then there's something wrong with me? 




 So I'm having family photos done tomorrow at around noon. It's going to be outdoors. I live in Tennessee. What should I wear? I'm going to go shopping today. I'm looking for some jeans and a shirt and possibly a jacket. So, generally speaking, what colors/patterns should I get? What kind of jeans/shirt should I get? If I got a jacket of some sort, what kind should I get? It's a pretty casual shoot. I really want to look nice because these will be the last photos of us for a good while. Thanks guys! 




 So I want to start off by saying I'm sorry if this isn't a good place to post this, but it seems like it belongs here. Also, I'd like to say that yes, Nathan Fillion would be the perfect Nathan Drake, but I think we can agree that it won't happen unfortunately. Now, the person I think should play Nathan Drake is Bradley Cooper. Hear me out. The guy is a pretty solid actor. He can be funny and he can be serious. He also has the physique to be able to handle a role like this. The guy's got star power! This is just my opinion, but what do you guys think? Every time this topic comes up, Brad Cooper's name isn't even mentioned.  









 Okay so you know how at the end when Joe sees Sara get shot and the screen's all gold, and Joe says he saw everything, a mother die for her son, a man kill for his wife yadda yadda yadda. Then he says something about how the loop is closed or something like that. I think it should have ended there implying that he caused Cid to be the man he grows up to be, and the events in the movie will repeat itself forever, therefore creating an endless "loop". I think that's how it should have ended. I think it would have created a bigger impression and been a better ending. But this is all just my opinion. 




 I don't know if this goes here, but here I go. I want to know why so many pc users relentlessly hate on Apple products. I'm not trying to start a flame war or anything. I want to have a serious discussion about this because I am genuinely curious. Like when my friend (who hates Apple and loves pc and Android) comes over and I say my iphone or macbook is acting up, he says it's "because Apple made it." I've asked him what his problem with Apple is before and he has never given me an answer other than "because Apple sucks." In fact, most of my pc friends react this way. So in an attempt to get valid reasons why people who use pc and Android tend to hate Apple, I've come to you guys for answers. Again, I'm not trying to start a flame war. I just want some insight on this issue.  




 I saw a movie either in the late 90s or early 00s where a guy transformed into a woman (I think only at night?). I think when he was a woman he had black hair, but I'm not sure. I remember one scene where he was a woman and some guy (with glasses?) was trying to sleep with him/her. Again I'm not 100% certain on some of these details. 









 I ask this because in order to make one, they will have to reboot Batman again. Plus they will have to reboot Superman again because this new Man of Steel (based on the trailer) will be like Batman and won't allow a way for other DC heroes to exist in its world. In my opinion, I would rather have a great Batman series, Superman series, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, etc. if it meant that there wouldn't be a Justice League movie rather than have crappy movies of these super heroes just so a JL movie can happen. So how badly do you guys want a JL movie? Bad enough to have crappy super hero movies just to have your JL movie? Or would you rather continue having great super hero movies if it meant there would be no JL movie?  









 Hi, I'm new to Reddit and relatively new to photography. I have a Canon EOS Rebel T3i and would like to start taking pictures of things like insects, plants, eyes, and other small things. What kind of lens should I get? What should I look for? Like I said, I'm relatively new to photography so I don't know a lot of the terminology, so could you please answer as if you were talking to an amateur. Also, if you could maybe suggest some lenses, that would be helpful, too. Thanks you guys for any help you can give!
Also, any tips for macro photography would be nice! Not necessary, just nice! 





























 See I'm on both sides. Place Beyond the Pines and Only God Forgives are two of my favorites of the year. 




 But the thing about voice acting is, is that you can really only covey emotions through your voice. Some of the greatest acting performances are more than just saying things with words. It's also saying things with your body. Your mannerisms. You brought up Mark Hamill's Joker vs Heath Ledger's. Yes Mark Hamill's Joker is great, and I'd say probably more iconic, but what makes Heath Ledger's Joker incredible is his mannerisms. They way he walks, moves his hands, his body language, how he licks his lips. These are things you just cannot do as a voice actor.  




 Because I can think of a few actors/actresses that deserve to be nominated more than someone who did voice work. I understand voice work isn't easy, but it just wouldn't be fair to nominate someone who did a voice over instead of someone who actually was physically there. Physically acting with more than just their voice. Acting includes not just voice, but expression of the face and body. Some of what makes acting performances great are the subtle things they do with their face and body. 

Edit: I should clarify that I DO agree that voice actors should be recognized. What they do is incredible and not everyone can do it. What I'm saying is that *acting* acting and *voice* acting are two different things. They require different kinds of performances. Voice acting is about how you convey a character through voice while *acting* acting is about how you convey a character not only through voice, but through your mannerisms. They way you walk, move your hands, the way you look and so on. Things you simply cannot do as a voice actor.

It might be weird to segregate a Best Voice Acting category and a Best Actor category, but it makes sense. We have two separate writing categories: one for original screenplay and adapted screenplay. We have two separate Best Picture categories: one for animated and one for live action. Why can't we just have two separate acting categories? That way voice actors don't have to compete with *actor* actors. I don't think voice actors should be treated differently, but they do. Given a choice between a voice actor and an *actor* actor, the Academy will always choose the latter. Is it fair? No, but that's the way it is. If you lump voice acting in with Best Actor, they will almost always never get the award. They might not even get a nomination, but if there were a category for voice acting then they would get the notoriety they deserve every year. 




 What ever happened to Killer Crow? 




 We do agree but we don't. I agree with everything you've said, but I think where we disagree is the whole "good movies are good movies" thing, and I'm okay with that. I still think that as long as a movie is good, it's good. I don't care if it's a remake, or whatever. I'd rather see a really good movie that isn't the most original thing than an original movie that's bad. And that's just my preference. I'm not saying that all original movies are bad, in fact, some really great movies are original. But at the same time, there have been some really good movies that are remakes, sequels, prequels, reboots, adaptions or whatever. 




 You do realize I said basically the same thing, right? I never said anything about shot for shot remakes. 




 If this is true then this is sad. Good movies are good movies. It shouldn't matter if it's a remake, sequel, prequel or whatever. It's not fair to just write off a movie and give it a bad review simply because it's a remake, sequel, prequel, reboot of whatever.  




 Side by Side, Senna, Samsara, and Dear Zachary are incredible documentaries. Especially Samsara.  




 Are these legit reviews and is it really that bad or are people prejudging this movie? I haven't seen any reviews yet. This is a movie I'm really looking forward to and it bums me out to see it at below average because that means that it's either genuinely bad, or people don't want to like it and are hating on it. 

  




 So I'm making a Christmas sweater. [This](http://therightprofile.blogspot.com/2011/12/now-i-have-machine-gun-ho-ho-ho.html?m=1) one to be particular. My question is what should I use to write on it to achieve that clean, bright look? A sharpie? Paint? Or what? Thanks in advance!  




 So in English we watched a documentary called [Salute](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0874317/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). You can read the story [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Olympics_Black_Power_salute). Basically, my teacher wants us to write an argumentative essay about something from 1968, using the movie as one of our sources. I decided to compare the black power movement to the gay rights movement. So far all I have is a thesis statement, but I'm having a hard time coming up with points and how to structure my introduction paragraph.

My thesis statement also needs to be improved in terms of wording. My thesis statement says: "Racism in the 1960's was so strong, that it would have been better if it was a gay rights sign instead of a black power sign." I can't figure out how to word it though.

But I really need help coming up with arguments to support my thesis. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Tell us what is holding you up. 




 **Rock Band 3**: This is a game I never really stopped playing. I play it like every week. Man, this game is great. Definitely one of my all time favorites. So many songs. But as I was playing this past week I started thinking about if we'd ever see another Rock Band game. With the new consoles and everything they're capable of, it'd be interesting to see a next gen Rock Band game. But only if they allow us to import all the songs we've bought. I don't really know of anything they could do better in Rock Band 4 or whatever they'd call it other than graphical stuff and maybe allow us to upload our own music?

**Fallout 3**: This is a game I played when it first came out. Got to like level 5 and wasn't having any fun so I stopped. I guess it was because I had never played a game like it before so I didn't know *how* to play it. So a few years later Skyrim comes out and I try it and fall in love with it. Over a hundred hours of Skyrim later, and I decide to go back to Fallout 3. I am absolutely loving it now. I've been playing it so much this past week. I guess Skyrim was sort of a good introduction to that style of game, and because I was use to it, Fallout went from feeling so foreign to feeling so natural and fun. Now I'm looking into playing New Vegas, but yeah, Fallout 3 is so incredible. 




 No one will stop you. 




 That'd be a fantastic feel-good movie! 




 What does that have to do with anything? 









 300 - Prepare for Glory

No Country for Old Men - There are no clean getaways.

Cobra - Crime is a disease. Meet the cure.

Evil Dead - The most terrifying film you will ever experience. (Even though it wasn't, when that tagline was released it was so bold and got me so hyped.) 




 Brandon Lee's accidental death on the set of The Crow.

"In the fatal scene, which called for the revolver to be actually fired at Lee from a distance of 12-15 feet, the dummy cartridges were exchanged with blank rounds, which feature a live powder charge and primer, but no bullet, thus allowing the gun to be fired without the risk of an actual projectile. But since the bullet from the dummy round was already trapped in the barrel, this caused the .44 Magnum bullet to be fired out of the barrel with virtually the same force as if the gun had been loaded with a live round, and it struck Lee in the abdomen, mortally wounding him. He was rushed to the New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington, NC where he underwent 6 hours of surgery. However, attempts to save him were unsuccessful, and Lee was pronounced dead at 1:03pm on March 31, 1993 at the age of 28. The shooting was ruled an accident." 




 That's why I said "I'd". As in "I" would. 




 Things like cameras, tripods, lenses, mics, etc 




 Yeah I use to rent this movie like every weekend! I'd love to see it again. And thanks for the gold, it was so unexpected! 




 Lawrence of Arabia is fantastic, but I'd say 2001 owns the 60's. 









 It'd be funny though if they gave you the gold instead of /u/Vendredi8 




 Man, that movie's the sickest! 




 Don't they check your receipt at the door when you leave Walmart? 









 Hmm maybe he did mean Chang. I thought it was interesting though some of the similarities Julian and One Eye had. Like the fact that they both had one eye and SPOILERS!!!!! 

how Julian cuts open someone's stomach just like One Eye also how Julian was pretty much silent. 

But it could be Chang. One Eye was basically Odin and Chang is also God like.  




 I think its hard to say without knowing what you like, but Holy Motors is a truly strange and unique film. That movie is so strange and it just sticks with you.  




 I think Nicolas Refn hinted that Ryan Gosling's character in Only God Forgives is the character One Eye from Valhalla Rising reincarnated.  




 I don't know what it would be nominated for but The Place Beyond the Pines was great. 

Also regardless of what people think about Only God Forgives, that movie has some great cinematography and music.  




 Okay one more quick question. What does it mean by EA disk? Can I go to gamestop and find it? Is it easy to find? 




 That video makes it look easy. Is it as easy as it seems? I'm not great with computers. Also thanks! 




 How *do* you get custom songs? 




 Sorry? I couldn't find one on Amazon so I looked elsewhere and that was the only one I found. If people can find it for less that's great! I don't know why I was downvoted. I didn't pick the price.

I was just trying to be helpful :(

Edit: Wow first I get downvoted for trying to help then I get downvoted for apologizing. Real cool guys.  




 A weird question, but I was wondering if there were any songs that are similar to Nine Inch Nails songs from the album The Fragile. I know there are NIN songs available but none are from the Fragile. 

Like songs that are kind of epic style rock and loud? 




 Why not? 




 [Here](http://www.retrofestive.ca/grumpy-cat-jingle-all-the-way-to-hell-ugly-sweater/) 




 I think if it is real they revealed too much with the logo. If they wanted people to be guessing what it was they wouldn't have such a dead giveaway to fallout. That logo pretty much kills the surprise.  




 I'm looking for some good thanksgiving movies to watch with my family. It doesn't have to explicitly be *about* thanksgiving but it can also take place during thanksgiving. Just looking for some good movies that go with the thanksgiving season.  




 It's always kind of bugged me when actors complain about how hard their job is. I get acting is hard, I've done it before, and it's okay to say it's hard, but don't complain. You make millions of dollars. There are millions of people who would kill to be in your position. 




 Man this is sad to hear. I loved his music so much. 




 I actually think it'd be pretty cool to see "Wicked" versions of other Disney villains.  









 I love how people call it a dog game yet there are like only two parts where you use the dog. 




 Mystic River is absolutely fantastic.  




 Immortals. I'd recommend it to my friend who likes Greek mythology and loved 300.  




 That movie was the sickest! 




 I dunno man, if they collected phones at the beginning of detention I could still see it working.  




 In all honesty though, I feel like Breakfast Club is one one of those movies that *could* be remade like every thirty years to appeal to that generation at the time. The basic idea of that movie is timeless. There will always be kids, always be high school and always be detention. Just update the slang and fashion and BOOM! You have a competent and relevant remake that will always work.  




 It's totally fine to think the Dark Knight is one of the greatest movies. People get a lot of crap for thinking that, but TDK *is* a great movie. It's exceptionally well made, well acted and well directed. The only reason people say it can't be one of the greats is because it's new. But in like fifteen years when it gets "old" I think people will be okay calling it one of the greatest movies made.  




 Not really. A movie can be mind blowing or awe inspiring and still not be your favorite. Avatar is nowhere near my favorite movie, but it's something I'd love to see again for the first time. 




 Oh wow! This totally might be it. I'm about to watch some videos of it to find out for sure. But this might be it! 




 This isn't it. What bugs me is that I'd immediately recognize its name if I heard it.  









 So in this animated movie, probably early 90s, there was a talking puppy and a talking owl. Maybe more animals? And maybe in a castle? House? It's not a lot to go on but all I remember.  




 I thought the scene in Watchmen when a younger, less experienced Rorschach finds the pedophile. That was pretty intense.  




 Honestly though this should be the least of people's worries. This is a REALLY DUMB thing to complain about because it affects absolutely nothing in terms of games and hardware.  




 Honestly though this should be the least of people's worries. This is a REALLY DUMB thing to complain about because it affects absolutely nothing in terms of games and hardware.  




 Yeah, of all the things people complain about in terms of Xbox One, this is seriously the thing they should care about the least.  




 I'm right handed and I've always gotten disks out with my left hand. 

It'll feel weird on the left side at first but in a few months or so it won't be a big deal and people will get use to it I think.  




 I don't know the law well but can cops shoot me if I punch a bunch of people? I love fist fighting in this game but then the cops come and shoot me and ruin it :(

Also screw the cops that hang on the side of SUVs and box you in and shoot you to death.  




 Or a system that let's you explain yourself to the cops and be like, "Yo sorry man this was totes an accident!"

Or at least just get a small fine instead of it being either cops die or you die.  




 I always hate though how slowly you break into cars. You have to go through the entire "look and make sure no one sees me, bash window, slowly get in and slowly hotwire the car" animation. The cops are after you! They are shooting you! Don't check to see if they are watching you break in! Just smash the window, hop in and start it as quickly as you can!!! 




 Then box you in, preventing you from going anywhere then shoot you to death.  




 I feel like the only way to escape five stars in GTA V is either by train or underground tunnel.  




 I will say though occasionally there is that super awesome moment of suspense when you're hiding at the end of an alley and the cops walking towards you. Then right before they get to you, your wanted goes away.  




 I got five stars and went to Trevor's airstrip and got into a plane because it seemed like the only possible way to escape. It was a HUGE ordeal getting in the air. But once in the air I thought I was home free. Nope. Helicopters kept spawning in front of me. Gave up trying to lose them and just flew into a building and died. I'm not giving them the satisfaction of killing me. 

Someone summed up the cops in GTA V perfectly. "The cops in GTA V would murder their families if it meant killing you." 




 Mighty Morphin Power Rangers the Movie 




 I'm playing through Fallout 3 for the second time. The first time I really didn't enjoy it. I think it was because it was so different from anything I had played before that I didn't know how to play. So then I played Skyrim and loved it! So this past week I went back to Fallout 3 and I'm really loving it now.

So my question is, what's the word on Fallout 4? Has it been officially announced? Are there any details or leaks about it? The technical leaps Bethesda has made since Fallout 3 really get me excited about Fallout 4. If it's happening that is. Any info about it? 




 Looking for someplace that has pork buns.  




 Just what is your favorite tv show theme song or opening credits? 




 Looking for Christmas songs. Doesn't matter what the song is or who it's by. If it's Christmas themed, I want it. 









 I love movies where the main character(s) hallucinates and the line between whats real and fake becomes blurred. They lose their grip on reality for whatever reason. Like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or The Shining or Pi. What are some good movies like this? Movies where they hallucinate and lose their grip on reality and can no longer separate what's real and fake. 




 I'm looking for some good movies with religious undertones. Maybe movies about someone finding or rediscovering their faith in God. It doesn't even have to explicitly be about God, but someone finding or rediscovering their faith in a greater power. Maybe destiny? I'm thinking specifically like Terrence Malick films how they have beautiful religious undertones like The Thin Red Line, The Tree of Life and To the Wonder.  









 I love M83 and am looking for similar music. I'm mostly referring to their songs [My Tears Are Becoming a Sea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLuc8vjny5c) and [Outro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWdiaS3uq4) 




 I really love Nine Inch Nails' album The Fragile. I don't know what it is about it I like, but what are some other albums, artists, or songs with a similar style and feel to The Fragile album? 




 I really liked whoever opened up for NIN in Nashville but don't know who they were or what songs they played.  









 They don't even have to be your favorite ones. I'm just looking for some decent movies that are about Thanksgiving or take place during Thanksgiving. 




 I'm looking for a post that was on here. Although it might have been posted to r/pics. But I'm pretty sure it was posted here. 

It was a pic of a gorilla with a weird look. The title said something along the lines of "He gave me this look after I mouthed something" 




 What movie do you think does the best job at character development? Like fleshing out their characters to where they don't feel like characters anymore, but feel more like real people. A movie where by the end of it, you feel like you've known the characters for years and therefore feel a connection to them. 




 I don't watch horror movies so I've never seen any of these but I've heard good things about them. 

Inside

Martyrs

Rec (original one)

The Descent

Could you tell me which of these would be best to watch? Or if you have a better suggestion? Newer horror movies from like 1998 to present are preferred unless you know of an older one that still holds up well. Like I said, I don't frequently watch horror movies so I don't know which are good.  














 I feel like it's been a while since we've heard anything regarding it. Anyone know when it's supposed to be released? I know Volition said it was going to be released close to the games release, but it's already October 9th. 




 Anything from clothes, mannerisms, and everything in between. 









 Is there really even a point to wearing a mask in single player free roam? I remember before the game was released they were talking about masks and made it sound like Red Dead Redemption. Like you would go into an inventory, put a mask on, cause some mayhem, then once you get out of the line of sight of the cops you could remove the mask and lose your wanted level. 

The only way to equip and remove your mask is by going in your home. So is there really even a point to having a mask in the game?
 




 What movies do you think have the best sound design and sound effects? 









 I love movies like Starship Troopers and Jarhead. War movies that focus more on bootcamp, living with a troop and the life of a soldier. War movies that don't really focus on the war and action pert but more on the training and life of a soldier. Not like Saving Private or Black Hawk Down where the focus is on the battle. Any movies or TV shows like this? 














 Purpose: It's mostly going to  be something to carry on a daily basis. Used for things like opening stuff, basic uses, and even, god forbid, self defense if the situation calls for it.(I live in a very rough neighborhood)

Size: I'm looking for something not too big, but still a good size. Something that fits comfortably in a pants pocket.

Knife type: Folding knife is best

Price Range: I'd like to not spend more than $100 if possible.

Type/Style: I don't go camping too often, but I'd love to have something pretty rugged that could handle the great outdoors.

Blade Type: Plain edge is preferred, but a combo of plain and serrated is okay too! 

Blade Steel: I don't know or understand enough about steel to make a good educated guess on what steel would be best. I'm not picky. I guess something that stays sharp longer, but without being too pricy.

Anything else: Nothing else really. Just need a good, durable everyday knife that will last a long time.

If you need anymore info I'd love to give it. Thanks for any and all help! 




 I have very straight and fine and thin hair so I often run into the problem that every product I've used so far makes my hair look and feel gross. Like really greasy. What are some good styling products that work well with my kind of hair and won't make it look and feel gross? 














 I re-watched The Strangers yesterday and that movie may not be the best (I love it), but there is one scene in that movie that's so great. The woman is just walking around her kitchen then out of nowhere the masked dude just walks up on the back door and watches her. No loud music, no sudden movements, no jump scare, just great subtle horror.

Now I'm looking for other horror movies that have great subtle horror. Any ideas? 




 So I was dropping off Jimmy somewhere after switching to Michael and was wondering what would happen if I ran Jimmy over. Turns out that when I ran him over, Michael yelled, "No! No! No!" I got out and Jimmy didn't move.

A day latter I called Jimmy and it was busy. Did I kill Jimmy for good? 




 I just want to screw around in the world with no consequences. I've heard conflicting info on if this cheat is real or not. Is it just no one ha discovered it yet? 




 And what would it basically be about? Buddy cop, road trip, etc.

This question was inspired by a question /u/ctopherrun asked on here regarding a Michael Clarke Duncan/Terry Crews buddy movie. 

But yeah, who are your picks, alive or dead, to see in a buddy comedy movie? 




 I was wondering if anyone has heard anything about when we might see a trailer. It feels weird that there have already been two trailers shown at comic con yet nothing for the public and it's released in May next year.

Godzilla is one of my most anticipated movies and I just want to see something. Does anyone know when they plan on showing a teaser or something? 




 I'm looking for a subreddit like battlestations where people post pics of their setup, but for more home entertainment like stuff. Like console gamers or pictures of entertainment set ups. I don't game on a pc. Mostly xbox. I'm about to redesign my living room and I'm just looking for inspiration, but all I can find really on battlestations are pics of desktops.

Is there a subreddit like battlestations geared more towards console gamers or home entertainment setups?

 I don't ever play strategy games but kind of want to. What are some good strategy games for the 360 for beginners that aren't too complicated? Something to ease me in? 




 Like real adventure movies were someone goes on an adventure or journey or something. Like Up or something. I just can't think of many good adventure movies besides the obvious ones.

So what are your favorite adventure movies? 




 So in the mission where you rescue Asha, the one where you fight your evil twin, I noticed something great. 

When you sneak up on the dude talking to his wife/girlfriend, I just sat there for like more than five minutes just listening to him going, "Mmmmmhmmmmm." crying from all the laughter.

Did anyone else notice this or get as much joy from it as I did? 














 College professor of film or Forensics? There really aren't any specifics. I guess just assume anything and everything. I want help thinking of all the pros and cons of these two career options. I'm at a crossroads in my life and need help understanding the pros and cons so I can better figure out which is best for me. Forget about which one I prefer. All I care about is which is better in terms of the pros and cons.

 I wanted to use the slowmo cheat because it sounds cool, but it doesn't work. It's listed as a cheat on multiple sites. There is also a fast forward cheat, but it does work. I found out that the slowmo cheat is "Silverlink"? What does that mean? Someone said it was unlocked when you finish the game. It didn't unlock for me and I can't find any videos of the slowmo cheat. So is it real?  




 So yesterday I asked what your favorite mission was, but I figured that there are some missions that weren't my favorite, but had some of my favorite moments. So I'm asking a slightly different question that should allow more of a variety of answers and discussion. 




 Pretty simple question. What was your favorite mission? 









 For some reason I love watching love story dramas, where the relationship is tragic. Something like Blue Valentine or A Moment to Remember. What are some films with heart-wrenchingly tragic love stories?  









 I watched Pain and Gain the other night and I was thinking the entire time, "Man, this is some super dark humor." But I kind of liked it. I enjoy dark humor, so I was wondering what movies you guys have seen that has had some really dark humor. What movie has had some of the darkest humor you've seen? 














 I have the link to the video. It's been cut down to the right length, I just need it in gif format with text matching the words, but no text with the "Haha", just the part where he says words. 

[Video](http://www.tubechop.com/watch/1403787)

Thank you! 




 I saw this short film purely because it was suggested in the "Related" section. It was about an artist whose wife dies. Then he builds a sculpture to remember her. As the short progresses, he slowly becomes a statue while his statue of his wife slowly becomes human. Really weird, but beautiful short film. Anyways, can't remember the name and want to show it to someone. Can anyone help? 









 I watched Spy Kids 2 the other day. I loved it when I was a kid, but as a teen I just thought it was terrible. However, as an adult I loved it! I thought it was kind of genius and couldn't help but to love it. I think it's because as an adult, I realized it wasn't really meant to be taken seriously, but instead is suppose to be cheesy. I haven't had that much fun watching a movie in a long time. 

So I got to thinking, what kids movies do you enjoy or understand or appreciate more now that you're an adult? 









 When I heard there were going to be voice sliders I got super excited. But when I fired up the Inauguration Station, created a character, and went to choose his voice, I was sad to see that the voice slider, while it does adjust the pitch, unfortunately gives your character a robotic sound whenever the slider is on anything other than normal. Maybe it's not that big of a deal, but I was just kind of disappointed. 




 Also, what areas should I stay away from when looking for a place to live? Also, would it be cheaper to rent an apartment or buy/rent a house? And what neighborhoods are not only good, but have a reasonable cost of living? If you need any more info, please let me know. I've only been to LA once when I was little and don't know what to look for or where to look. I'm extremely grateful for any and all help/advice! Also, do you know of any great online resources I can find with info on real estate as well as other housing. I live across the country and cannot afford to visit LA frequently. 









 My birthday is coming up this week and me and a few friends are just going to hang out and eat pizza. My question is, what place in Memphis or surrounding areas has the best pizza? Doesn't matter if they do delivery or not. Just looking for the best pizza in the city and neighboring towns. 




 Like the blood effects when someone is shot. I'm interested in which movies you think have the best blood hits. It doesn't have to be an action movie. Even if only one person in the movie is shot, if it's good, I want to know about it. Doesn't matter how realistic or over the top it is, practical effects or CGI, doesn't matter. However, I prefer something visually appealing, but I'm open to any and all suggestions. I'm just interested in the different styles and looks of blood hits there are and want to know which ones you think are the best. 




 I heard a song recently, maybe a pop song, but it's recent. It features what sounds like either a marimba or steel drums. It's not fast paced though, but not too slow. That's really all I know about it. I don't even know the lyrics other than part of the chorus that goes something like, "She something something something." Obviously they don't say "something". The somethings represent how many words there are in the chorus. So he says, "She" then says like three more words. I know it's not much info, but I appreciate any help. 




 I heard a song at work today and loved the beat and rhythm of it, but don't know what it is. I know it's fairly recent because we only pay recent music, but not top forty stuff. I've never heard this song anywhere else before. I know one lyric, "I'll love you until the end of time." Or something like that. It's a pop song with a sort of middle eastern beat/rhythm to it however the singer sounds American. I know that at the end of the song he says, "Until theee eeeeennnndddd ooooof tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiime."

The song has a pretty chill sound to it. It's not a slow love song. Definitely more of a pop song.

I know this isn't a lot to go on, but it's all I got. 

Edit: New details: Most likely male singer. Also I should clarify what I mean by recent. What I mean by recent is like this year.  




 So I watched Samsara recently and two shots struck me with how powerful and how much they said without saying anything. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=PAeIDRzGZ1A t=3660) one of a geisha shedding a tear, showing how hard her life must be. And [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=PAeIDRzGZ1A t=4602) one of a disfigured war veteran at a memorial cemetery, showing the price for peace and the cost of war.

Are there any other great shots like these? Ones that say so much without saying hardly any dialogue? You know what I mean? Sort of like how a picture is worth a thousand words kind of thing? What are some great examples of this in film? Shots that are so powerful and say so much with so little. I hope I explained myself well. I'm not really looking for scenes per se, more so just single shots. 









 What scenes are your favorite uses of the quiet scream? Where a character screams but the sound of his scream is cut out. Think Dark Knight when Harvey is in the hospital bed and he screams but it's muted out. Or more recently The Artist where the main character has his hallucination and he drops to his knees and screams but is not heard.  




 I'm trying to find movies where the opening scene is basically a quiet, typical opener, then BAM! Something in the vein of the opening scene of [Children of Men](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCTgUq6hzUk). Clive Owen just gets some coffee walks out of the shop, then BOOM! a bomb goes off then title card.

Or Reservoir Dogs. Starts with them having a comical, friendly conversation, then all of the sudden it goes to Orange in the back seat bleeding to death and screaming.

Or think Dark Knight when SPOILER!!!!!!!!! Rachel dies. Shes talking to Harvey, everything's fine, then BOOM, out of nowhere the building explodes.

Another great example isn't a movie, but rather a video posted a few days ago. Where a woman is driving for like 20 seconds then out of nowhere without warning, a car comes flying at her. 

I'm really looking for that contrast of when a scene goes from quaint and quiet to fucked in less than a second. 

I guess it doesn't have to be an opening scene, but it's preferred. The only real stipulation is that it has to be a pretty normal non action scene at first then out of nowhere something happens.  









 So me and my mom watched this Korean movie on Netflix called [A Moment to Remember](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0428870/?ref_=sr_1). I have to say it is one of the best movies I've seen as well as one of the saddest, most heart breaking, yet beautiful. We bawled our eyes out. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and see this film. 









 I work at American Eagle and supposedly all American Eagles play the same music, so that might help. I only know brief parts of the choruses of the two songs.

The first is a punk rock sounding song with a female vocalist (or at least they sound female). The chorus goes something like: "She said don't forget your friends, I know; Don't forget your friends, I won't; don't forget your friends." Or at least it sounds a lot like that.

The second song I have even less info on. It's a pop song sung by an extremely British guy. So much so that when he says "No" it sounds like, "Now". The chorus goes a little like: "Never gonna get, never gonna gt it, no." I know that's super vague, but at work I can't focus on the lyrics plus it's not ever loud enough.

I only hear these songs at work and I've tried looking up the American Eagle playlist, but still can't find them. I'm grateful for any and all help! Thanks!  




 I was really into this movie I was watching but then when someone died, it was really terrible cgi gore. So I was thinking, what are you're favorite uses of practical gore effects? What scenes really stick out to you when it comes to practical makeup effects? 




 Saw it yesterday and wanted to read some discussions on it, but there are no threads. 

I don't really enjoy horror, but I wanted to see it purely because I heard it was a well made film. I have to say I thought the direction was really great as well as the acting. I thought the first half was fantastic, but I thought the second half, while still good, felt not as great or scary. All in all I thought this was one of the best horrors in years. 

So what did you guys think? Really want to get a discussion started! 




 I moved away recently and don't know anyone where I live now. My birthday is in a few weeks and I got a little depressed because I have no one to spend it with. Then I thought, "Hey, this doesn't have to be a sad thing!" So, now I'm trying to figure out what I can do on my birthday by myself that will be nice, fun, or enjoyable. I don't want to spend my birthday thinking about how alone I am. I want to enjoy it!

So what are some cool/nice/enjoyable things I can do on my birthday without being sad? 
























 Right now Super Hot is getting some buzz. In Super Hot, time moves only when you move. It's pretty interesting. Right now it's only a demo, but still really good and really fun.

Also, there is Receiver. Receiver is an ultra realistic shooter. In the game, you have to operate your gun like you would a real one. Taking it off safety, counting bullets, putting bullets in magazines, cocking it, etc. It makes for some really tense gameplay. Every time you spawn you are given a random gun with a random amount of bullets. 




 It's not my favorite game but one of my favorites.

I always thought Bradley Cooper would be a great Nathan Drake from Uncharted. 




 Boy Meets World.

That or any Disney movie. Especially Disney channel original movies. 




 This is actually the case for most movies! 




 Me. 




 I don't have an under the bed. That's just another place for spiders to go. 




 Fuck.

It doesn't really make sense. In fact, a lot of the time "fuck" and its derivatives are frequently used purely to bridge thoughts and sentences. 

There are plenty of words we could say in it's place, but it *is* useful to express certain emotions. It's the same with any swear word really. They don't make a lot of sense, there are plenty of words that could be said in their place, but they do a good job of expressing certain emotions. 




 Saw Nine Inch Nails. Absolutely fantastic concert. It had the best lighting I've ever seen at a concert and amazing stage design. 




 Nine Inch Nail's album The Fragile. Incredible, interesting music.

Also, apparently Rage Against the Machine's self titled album is recorded with highest standards and is used to test audio equipment. 




 In person? I saw a dead cat. But the way I saw it was like something out of a movie.

I was asked to take care of my neighbor's cat while she was gone for Christmas. One day I went over and saw Mulligan, that's the cat's name, sitting in the bedroom with foamy drool hanging from his mouth and he was making weird noises. I took him to the vet and the vet said it's probably just stress and to not worry about it. "It might go away when the owner gets back."

So a few days later I walk over to my neighbors house to feed him and check up on him. I opened the door and the whole house is silent except for the Beethoven-esque music playing on the radio(we turned the radio on to keep Mulligan company). So this beautiful orchestra music is playing and I look down the hall and all I see is his tail sticking out. I called his name and he didn't respond.

I walked down the hall and there was Mulligan, dead. He was laying next to his toy, too. I checked to see if he was breathing and maybe just passed out. He was stiff as a plank of wood. He was gone at least 12 hours.

The whole thing was very eerie and morbid with the quiet calm house and this beautiful orchestra music echoing through the house. Sad day. Apparently he had a stroke.

I also hit a golden retriever once with my car when I was in high school. That was a tough day. 




 Look, I'm not saying that until we have evidence to disprove it, it's true. I'm saying that until we have evidence to disprove it we shouldn't rule it out.

Something may be ridiculous and unlikely, but that's not enough reason to say it's impossible. Not without evidence. Like I said, the lack of evidence that something *does* exist is not the same thing as having evidence that it *doesn't* exist. 

But you're right. It is a two way street. The lack of evidence that something *doesn't* exist is not the same thing as having evidence that it *does* exist. 

*That's* what I'm saying. No matter how ridiculous something is, without evidence to prove or disprove it, we can't rule it out.

I'm about to throw down another bad analogy. How do we know the sky is blue? Well, through science we know, but let's try another way for the sake of this analogy. A way to know would be to survey thousands of people. If you asked 10,000 people what color the sky is, it's safe to say all 10,000 will say "blue". So it's safe to say that the sky is in fact blue. I mean, how can that many people be wrong, right? Again, bad analogy, but it's the best way I can describe it.

It's kinda the same thing with the Bible. It's full of first hand accounts and testimonies of various people who have come in contact with God and/or Jesus and witnessed their, for lack of a better word, "powers". There *are* witnesses who saw Jesus heal the sick and afflicted. Now *how* he did this and the veracity of it is up to interpretation. But there *are* records of not only Jesus healing people, but also being resurrected. Around a hundred people *witnessed* Jesus being crucified and killed. And a few days later they saw him. Alive. Free of any scars except for the nail holes. Now again, *how* he did this and the veracity of it is up to interpretation, but there is a record of it happening. How could all of these people in the Bible be wrong and crazy? I don't know. But for right now, we have to kinda consider that maybe the Bible is accurate. Even if it is crazy.

 




 But like I said, my Bigfoot analogy was really dumb. It wasn't meant to be taken literally, it was meant to just put in perspective the whole thing. 

And also like I said, if you believe the Bible to be true, then there *is* proof. It's all written there. That's why I used Bigfoot as an analogy. Because the only proof we have are first hand accounts people have. Just like the Bible is firsthand accounts of people's interactions with God and Jesus. But again, this all goes back to faith. It's up to you, and only you to decide whether to believe it or not. And if you don't want to believe, fine, that's okay. That's your choice. 

But you should never rule anything out. We as a human race don't know everything. We are incredibly smart and have made massive advancements, but we still have so much to learn. 

I've said this in another thread but I'll say it here. The lack of evidence that something *does* exist is not the same thing as having evidence that it *doesn't* exist. Until we have evidence to disprove something, we should never rule it out. *That's* science.  




 I can't answer that because I just simply don't know. It's not about anyone being more special than others. It just happened that way. 

However people still had to have faith. There were numerous people who didn't believe. Jesus was crucified because they didn't believe he was the son of God.  




 Do you watch any of your own shows? Like do watch every new episode of Archer or Bob's Burgers when they first air? Like as a fan? Or do you not because hearing your own voice creates some sort of weird disconnect? 




 Then like I also said, if you're the kind of person who needs proof of everything, then there's really nothing anyone can do to convince you. 

No one has any physical evidence of God. Yet you ask for it knowing no one has it. Which leads me to believe that you simply don't want to believe.

So let me ask you: Do you want to believe? Because if the answer is "no" then there is no point in you asking people for evidence. Because there is nothing anyone can say or do to convince you. And maybe you simply don't want to be convinced, and that's okay, because that's what you want. 




 That's what I'm saying, the only evidence we have of God and Jesus doing those things is written in the Bible. It's up to you to have faith that the things written in the Bible are true. Even the crazy things like the burning bush, Moses splitting the sea, Jesus raising the dead and healing the sick and afflicted. 




 Experiences make people smart. You can study about things all you want, but until you experience something or try it out, you can never really fully understand it. I can read about how to cook a certain dish, but it's not until I actually try to cook it and tweak it that I actually *know* how to make it.

Now I'm not sure how much this applies to everything, but so far I've found it to ring true.  




 I don't know if this sheds any light on anything or helps at all, but that is kind of what religion is about. Religion is all about faith. If God came down in the flesh right now in front of everyone and showed us some Godlike powers and we all believed that this was the actual God, then it would eliminate the need for faith. We'd have proof that he exists. Full, undeniable proof.

Depending on what faith you choose to believe, if any, the reason we are here is to receive a body. A physical body. We wanted a body to be more like God and Jesus because they have physical bodies. Before the Earth was created, we were all in heaven. We were presented with two plans. One was by Satan in which we would be forced to do things on Earth against our will. The other plan, presented by Jesus, was we had free agency on Earth. There was a war in Heaven and those who sided with Satan were cast out of Heaven with him. But those who did side with Satan have a chance at redemption, which is a different discussion.

Anyway, those who sided with God and Jesus came to Earth. Here on Earth we not only received a physical body, but free will as well. This brings in the other reason why we are here: To be tested. To have our love for God tested. To have our faith tested. Now that we have free will, do we choose the way of God or Satan? Do we even believe in a God? This is basically our love and faith being tested.

If we have undeniable proof of God, then we don't have faith, we have science. And if we have science, proof of something, then there is no reason to have faith in it because we know beyond a reasonable doubt that it's true. This is a really dumb example, but God and heaven and all that stuff is sort of like Bigfoot. We don't have undeniable proof of his existence, but we have first hand accounts and testimonies of those who claim to have interacted with him. Those who choose to believe in Bigfoot are going on faith. The Bible, should you choose to believe it, is kind of like first hand accounts and records of people who have come in contact with religious experiences and Jesus and what not. 

This all goes back to the core component of religion. Faith. It sounds unreliable, and if you're the kind of person who needs proof of everything then there's really nothing anyone can do to convince you. You just have to have faith.

I hope I helped, even if it is just a little bit.  




 Wait I don't remember that, when did this happen? 




 Yes this is it! Thanks! 




 In this horror movie, which takes place in a jungle type location(maybe Australia?), a group of friends go camping I guess? They swim in a lake and I think one of them gets leeches. The leeches make her sick and turn her into like a homicidal maniac? One scene that sticks out is when the friends attempt to trap their turned friend by dropping a net on her. 

I don't remember thinking it was a great movie but I enjoyed it and would like to watch it again, but I have no idea what it was called. Help? 




 Someone asked what the creepiest Wikipedia article they knew was. I saved the post, but it doesn't show up in my saved section. Also, when I search for it, I can't find it. Did it get deleted? Or does someone have a link to it? 




 I'm curious about what event in your life led you to have such a vendetta against Mormonism. Why can't Mormons believe what they want? Why does what they do bother you so much? 

I just fail to understand why you feel the need to ridicule an entire religion. It shouldn't matter whether you believe what they do or not, or if you think they are ignorant. You don't go around saying people's religions are based off of lies. Religion is supposed to revolve around faith, not facts. Religion is all about worshiping Gods we can't prove exist. So even if you don't believe what Mormons believe is real or true, it doesn't matter. It's real to them. 

Also, why do you care so much? Do you believe you will be the great hero to all ignorant Mormons? The one who will wake them all up and make them see the error of their ways? 




 That's, like, not even the same thing.  




 You just said "probably" wrong. Because you *think* something *might* be wrong doesn't automatically make it wrong. Not unless you have proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The lack of proof that something *does* exist is not the same thing as having proof that it *doesn't* exist.  









 ITT: Mormon Bashing 




 You're allowed to believe whatever you want to believe and whatever, but how could you possibly know that the Book of Mormon is fiction? I mean, it's kind of dickish of you to basically say that everything a religion believes is false. You may *think* that, but you can't *know* that.   




 Poor Marv. 




 Anxiety 




 I don't mind comic book movies. I'm just tired of the idea that instead of Hollywood sitting down and coming up with original films, they look for what ever comic book hasn't been made into a movie, whether it should or not. 

Like I said, I don't mind comic book movies. In fact I quite enjoy them, but it seems like lately instead of being made along side other original films, comic book movies are taking the place of original films. I know Hollywood is a business, but it sucks that Hollywood will almost always choose a super hero or comic book movie instead of taking a risk and making original movies. 




 What nights are the board game nights 














 So my friends are super busy with college and work so we rarely get to hang out, but I love going out. I hate sitting at home by myself. 

What are some places or activities where I could go by myself and still have fun and get enjoyment and not feel weird being alone? 




 They don't have to be night clubs with loud music either. They can be jazz clubs, dance clubs or whatever. I'm just looking for some great clubs or bars with great atmosphere. I don't really venture into the club scene so I have no idea what the club scene in Memphis is like. 




 How do I learn what shows are where and when? Is there like a website or something? 




 I'm new, just starting out. I honestly don't have the slightest idea how to create a podcast. How to record one, and how/where to post it. What are some good resources for someone to learn all of this? Any help is incredibly appreciated! 









 Recently our neighbor went out of town for a few weeks and asked us to watch her cat. Long story short we went to her house to check on him the other day and discovered him lying on the floor dead.

After talking to our neighbor on the phone, she asked us to bury him in her backyard. So we got a box to put him in and when we picked him up he was stiff. Like a plank of wood. His joints wouldn't even move hardly.

What causes this? I know it's suppose to happen, but what happens in the body that causes it to become stiff and hard?

 The Proposition. Really good movie. 




 Also, report back! Would love to see an after shot 




 I know David Fincher comes from a background of directing music videos but who are some other directors who have directed music videos? Either before they were famous or after they became famous, I'm just looking for music videos by film directors.  









 So lately when I'm not home and out in public away from wifi, my phone will not connect to 4g. Like there isn't even an icon at the top. It didn't use to do this. It started about a week ago. It's a pain because it keeps me from doing ANYTHING that requires internet. What is causing this and how can I fix this? Any help?

Here's a screenshot http://imgur.com/390q1uY

You see in the top left corner? No wifi signal, no 4G, 3G or anything. 




 Why do you say that? If I said something wrong can you please correct me? 




 Yes this exactly. I haven't done anything different. Just one day there was nothing. 




 You're not getting too old. Rockstar tried to make a game with rules that contradict the kind of game it is. Open world sandbox games are not supposed to be restrictive. 




 I always thought it was more about the leather and less about cats. Like, he seems like a kind of latex/leather sort of guy.

 Charlie's Angels. I love that movie so much.  




 I dunno, I'd show a 13-14 year old The Matrix but probably not Wolf of Wall Street.  




 "How much you wanna make a bet I could throw a football over them mountains?" - Napoleon Dynamite 

I love it because it's so dumb and he's completely serious when he says it. 




 And don't be broad by saying Italian or Asian. Be specific! If it's pizza, what kind of pizza? What's on it? Describe what is in or on your favorite food! If it's from a restaurant, which one? 




 /r/nocontext 




 I think this is the best answer.  




 I'm super late to the party so this probably won't be seen.

The Tree of Life. I grew up in a very religious family. A family sort of like the one in the movie. I was super close to my mother and my father was a hard worker, so he wasn't around much. He was stern, didn't say much, and had a hard time showing his love for anyone. We all knew he loved us, but had a hard time saying or showing it. I saw the movie with my mother and we both cried. It was a very beautiful film about family, life, death, faith, and what it all means. 




 Even though I'm in my 20s, I felt like I was going to get in trouble by my mom for watching this movie. 




 It's hard to believe this is the same guy. 




 I'm wasn't defending Argo or knocking Lincoln, I was just interested in why you thought that. After your explanation I can see where you're coming from. Lincoln did have pretty great performances.  




 Question, What exactly did you find great about Sam Rockwell's performance in The Way Way back? I saw it and thought, while good, it mostly felt like Sam Rockwell being Sam Rockwell. 




 Really though? I mean I thought he was great but it felt like he was just Sam Rockwell in it. I'm not saying you're wrong for thinking that, I just find it an interesting choice. 




 I'm surprised to see New World mentioned. That movie was fantastic and Hwang Jeong-min was great! 




 You could also argue that Lincoln is a type of movie that has been done a hundred times over.  




 Wow, I never heard this before. It's fantastic! 




 Any song, anywhere, as long as it was a live performance. Links welcomed! 









 All I really listen to are 101.9, 98.1, 99.7 and 107.5. But they all play the same music. What are some other radio stations with different music? 









 Tree of Life. I think it's one of the greats. It's a super mixed movie. People either love it or hate it. Mostly hate. It has a pretty low score on IMDB (or at least to me it's low). And everyone I've talked to about it says its bad.  




 See the saddest thing about Paul Walker is that he was on the cusp of pulling a Matthew McConaughey. He was totally about to become the actor he was suppose to be. Running Scared is one of my all time favorites. 
 









 I'm not trying to discredit animated films or the people who make them. But I think it's more difficult to create beautiful cinematography in a live action film because cinematographers have to work within the realm of reality. They have do deal with real world lighting and what not. Whereas animators can kind of make it up. 

Again, I'm not trying to discredit any animated films or the hard work people put into making them.  




 What scene on top of the train? 




 I think there was something to get. But you didn't get it not because you're not smart, I just think that the movie was super vague on its symbolism and metaphors. I think even the smartest people will scratch heir heads at it.  




 I still want to see him do a super hero movie. 




 I just can't find it for the life of me. Anyone else go here that knows how? 




 xXx (Triple X)? 




 I don't know how plausible this is, but it could be he simply didn't know he was plagiarizing. 

What I mean is, have you ever thought of something or tried to remember something and then you think, "I can't remember if this was from a movie or book or dream."

There's a word for it. When you think of something and you think you're creating it from scratch but subconsciously you're pulling it from you memories of, in this case, a book. 

Now I'm not saying this is what happened or even that it's likely, but it is possible.  









 For example, Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit is one of my favorites.

Also, it can be a prequel, sequel, threequel or whatever. 









 Man I would have loved to see Inception as a horror movie. I really want to see what Nolan can do with horror. And I would love to see what kind of creepy, horrific, twisted things would've happen since anything can happen in dreams. Would be very interesting. 




 I think it all depends on personal taste. I prefer TRL because it focuses on the emotional and psychological toll of war. I love SPR, and I appreciate what it was trying to say but its message was drowned out by all the action and violence surrounding it.

Edit: Wow downvoted because my opinion is different than yours. Thanks for encouraging opinions and discussion, reddit.  




 Also, the Elton John biopic coming up. 




 Yeah that was probably the biggest shocker of the award season last year. Everyone thought Lincoln would win everything.  




 Hugo was pretty and well shot. But Tree of Life was incredibly gorgeous. Easily one of the most beautiful films ever shot.  




 I would give The Tree of Life best cinematography. One of the most beautiful movies. 

Also I don't know if it got a nomination or not but Samsara should have gotten best documentary. 

And I still think its a crime Christopher Nolan didn't get a best director nomination for Inception. 

Also I'd give Into the Wild a nomination for best score, original song, cinematography, picture, and leading actor. Don't know which it would've won but it definitely deserved more nominations.  




 You say that but if I remember correctly (which I'm probably wrong) didn't Lincoln only walk away with just a few awards? 




 I *hope* it's Lupita. I love Jennifer Lawrence and think she's a great actress and I haven't seen American Hustle, but Lupita's performance was incredible.  




 Frances Ha is one of my favorites of the year. Gerwig was great in it.  




 I definitely consider it emotional. It's a song where you can feel his pain. 




 Ouch :( 




 Exactly. 




 Lately I've been trying to find music where the singer is singing with so much emotional power, it's like you can feel their pain. Their suffering. Their sadness. Almost to where it might even sound like they're crying or holding back tears.

What are some songs like this? 









 I watched [The New Guy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241760/?ref_=nv_sr_3) the other day for the first time in years and I thought it was pretty great. I wanted to know what those of you who have seen it thought about it.

I thought it had some really great physical comedy and had some great cameos by celebrities. Definitely one of my favorite high school movies. It even has a decent message about being yourself and not forgetting who you really are.

Any one here seen it? And if so what are your thoughts on it? It's not a movie that gets mentioned hardly ever. 




 It's not that. This article is basically saying, "Despite your opinion, these are the worst movies of the year and if you like them and think they are not that bad then you are wrong." At no point do they say, "Hey, this is just our opinion." They're treating their opinion like it's the correct one. 




 I like to believe everyone is going by the saying, "Out of sight, out of mind." I think everyone wants to just forget that movie happened. And the best way to forget it is to never mention it. 




 I really liked Wrong and thought it was good. 




 It's not the same song, but it definitely sounds like the same guy. His name is Johann Johannsson. 




 This looks so sick! I really really hope this doesn't turn in to another case of Man of Steel where the trailer turns out better than the movie. I'm optimistic though.  




 I'm late but I wanted to give my personal thoughts on it. There have been some great advice on here already as well as not so great. But here are my thoughts. 

I feel like if two people love each other, and I mean really love each other, they will understand if one of them wants to wait. I feel like they wouldn't throw away their relationship with you if you don't do it. 

Also I feel there are more important things I want in a relationship than sex. Now is sex important? Yes I feel it is. But I don't think you can base your decision of whether you love someone or not on sex. I want a girl that I can have deep intense conversations with and I can feel comfortable being vulnerable around them. If I find a girl like that and we love each other, and she tells me she wants to wait, I'm not going to throw it all away.  It doesn't mean she loves me less. 

But this is all just my feelings on this.  




 I love them. They bring me back to a time when I was that age. I know most people would like to forget that time but it was the best time of my life. I love being reminded of it.  




 It makes it feel like I'm looking into the human body. Cells, nerves, all that stuff. 

I know this has been theorized before, but it's so cool to think about. What if our universe *is* someones body. And what if all of our bodies are different universes for other life forms. And their bodies and so on and so forth. Infinite universes.  




  two many ears

FTFY 














 But why do you think that though? 




 You're right. I was super surprised to hear the many bad reviews of The Counselor. I mean, when you look at all the people involved in it; Ridley Scott, Cormac McCarthy, Brad Pitt, Michael Fassbender, and Javier Bardem, it's easy to assume it won't be anything other than great. 




 But based on the director and his previous works, didn't you know what you were getting yourself in to? I mean Nicolas Refn isn't exactly known for having fast paced non stop action movies. What exactly *were* you expecting when before you saw it?

 




 Doesn't that kind of make it partly your fault? When you allow yourself to have high hopes for something, you automatically take the risk of it not meeting those expectations. Am I saying you're wrong for not liking it? No, not at all. It's perfectly okay to not like it. 

I am curious though to know your thoughts on it. 




 I agree. I think people are over exaggerating how terrible these movies are. I mean, they're pretty well made movies. Are they great? Not really, but I've seen WAY worse movies. In fact, I actually kind of dug the super dark comedy/crime tone of Hangover 3.  




 I was the same way. OGF is one of my favorites of the year. While I realize it's not perfect, I didn't think it was terrible. People tend to think that "slow" and "violent" and "little dialogue" automatically means bad. I understand that many people may not be into that, but that doesn't make something terrible. 




 I don't think this is the kind of movie you see based off of what people say. It's a very subjective kind of movie. You should see it on your own merits. If it is something you might be interested in then give it a watch. 




 You need to get your expectations straight before you see OGF. It's not Drive. Visually it's similar, but Drive is a lot more straight forward and easier to watch. If you go into OGF with the expectations that it's like Drive you won't enjoy it as much. It is incredibly slow. It takes its time. More so than Drive. It is more like Refn's Valhalla Rising. I'd say that if you like Drive than there is a good chance you'll like OGF, just don't expect it to be another Drive. If you don't mind movies that take their time and are really slow, then give it a watch. 




 Exactly. I feel like any movie can be terrible if you had the wrong expectations for it.  




 I know she doesn't resemble the physique of Wonder Woman, but I would've loved to have seen Olga Kurylenko as Wonder Woman. 









 "How much you wanna bet I could throw a football over them mountains?" 




 Of course it's private. 









 This is very helpful! Thank you! 




 I was watching Jumper, and it reminded me of the sweet marketing it had before its release. Before there was even a trailer, Jumper had this really cryptic website that, if I remember correctly, was set up like a conspiracy bulletin board with weird photos and notes on it. Finding out what the movie was, was sort of like solving a mystery. The same with Cloverfield. Strange teaser. Cryptic website.

What movies do you think have had great, clever, or interesting marketing? Billboards, websites, teasers, promotions, or anything else that falls under marketing. 









 MLA format.

I'm wondering about how to do a citation for a movie? I've never cited a movie before. I'm wondering if I need to cite a specific quote from a movie, or just reference the movie then cite it. Can I just reference a film and that count as a proper citation? Or if it's a quote from a person do i have to cite the person who said it in the movie as well as the movie itself? 









 Specifically citations? I posted in /r/HomeworkHelp, but that community isn't super active with there hardly ever being more than a dozen people there at a time. HomeworkHelp is great, but I need to find somewhere to ask a citation question where I can get some feedback quickly. Any subreddits like this? I have to finish this paper and all I need to do is work in this one source I'm having trouble with. Help? 




 My essay is basically done. All I need to do is work in a citation somewhere.

My question is about how to use a citation. Can I just reference something and that be considered a citation? Or does it have to be a direct quote? 

For example, my teacher is telling us that one of our citations has to be from this documentary we watched about The Black Power sign showcased at the 1968 Olympics. So I didn't really know how to use a movie as a source.

How exactly do I use a movie as a source? Can I put in a quote from someone that they said within the film and consider that a proper citation of the movie? Like for instance if someone said, "The stunt they pulled at the Olympics in 1968 is what propelled the Black Power Movement forward." If I put that quote in my essay, is that a proper way to use a movie as a source?

I really need help figuring out how to use this movie as a source. It's literally all I have left to do in my essay, and I cannot figure how how to do it properly. I've never used a movie as a source. Help? 




 Dat drum intro/outro 




 It doesn't have to be something exactly $50,000, but just think of it as that's how much you have at your disposal to spend on someone. 

Edit: Screw it! I can't change the title so I'll put in this edit. I'm raising the limit to $500,000. I want to see what you guys come up with. I want o see how much good you can do. And so you don't have to rack your brain trying to figure out how to spend every penny of it, let's say you can do whatever you want with whatever is left over. Blow it, put it in the bank or whatever. But I don't want to hear what you'll do with what's left, I want to hear how you'll use that money for good. 









 The Matrix. Saw it for the first time when I was a kid. It blew my mind. It was the movie that made me realize that movies can be more than just entertainment. I realized they could be art. If it wasn't for the Matrix, I wouldn't have seen all the movies I have seen now. The Matrix is also what got me into film making. Film is my passion. I love watching them and making them, and I owe it all to The Matrix. 




 You look like a tv star! 




 Don't know if you have one, but I'd love to see a current pic? If that's okay 




 I think there's more than that involved when it comes to Oscar bait. When I think of Oscar bait I think: period piece, usually biopic, has an ensemble cast, they alter their appearance somehow, and is usually directed by an Oscar nominated director. 

Things like The Kings Speech, The Artist, Lincoln, and even though it isn't out yet, American Hustle is looking that way. Now does Oscar bait mean "bad"? I don't think so. All those movies I listed are great. And even American Hustle looks good.  




 I'm the same way. I find myself playing devil's advocate a lot when talking about people with a group of friends. I don't like talking about someone behind their back. It feels...weird. It feels like I'm betraying them. I just can't do that. And if I do start to talk about someone, I feel bad midway through my sentence and back out before any damage is done. I guess it's because my parents always told me to "treat everyone like they are having a harder time than you." I don't know what kind of life this person has when I'm not around. I don't know what problems this person might be dealing with. And insulting them, whether it be to their face or behind their back, doesn't solve anything. 




 I don't know, man. They were either Oscar bait or had heavy handed messages about the environment, racism, or religion. 




 If that's the criteria we're going with for what makes something terrible, then I guess there are a lot of highly praised Oscar movies that are terrible. Wall-e's terrible, Americn History X is terrible. As well as American Beauty, Django Unchained, Gravity, 12 Years a Slave, The King's Speech, The Artist. I mean really, with the criteria you set up for what makes a movie terrible, this list can get pretty long. 




 But why though? I'm genuinely curious, not trying to start something. 




 Whenever 2004s Crash is brought up, almost everyone says it was terrible and "utter shit". I mean, it's not the best movie, and it shouldn't have won Best Picture that year, but I feel like I'm one of the few that not only like Crash, but think it's pretty good. Yeah it seems heavy handed with its message and it might have been Oscar-baity, but the acting seemed really solid. And the cinematography was pretty good as well as the directing. I mean all in all I think it's a decent movie at worst.

I just fail to understand why most people will say it's absolutely terrible and again, "utter shit". Could someone civilly explain to me why people think this, or if you think it then why?  I'm genuinely curious.  




 Yeah I love Saving Private Ryan, but I think The Thin Red Line is the better WWII movie. 




 Dude, was it oscar baity? Yes. Was it the best movie of that year? Not at all. But Crash is in no way a bad movie. 




 Everyone has their own opinion and to each his own, but I think "terrible" is a little strong. This was not a bad movie. It may have not even been good, but I thought it was decent and solid. What makes you say it's terrible? 




 Me? I mean when you look at who's involved it seems reasonable to assume it would be great.  




 I loved the original, but maybe I'm not as much as a hardcore fan because all in all I thought it was a solid remake. And I use "solid" loosely. It wasn't bad. In fact, it's pretty decent. I think as a movie it's pretty good, but as a remake it could have used some work. Maybe this will be a Daredevil scenario where the directors cut will greatly improve it. 




 When I said it felt rushed, I didn't mean just the ending felt rushed, I meant the whole movie felt rushed. 




 Eh, I don't know. I guess I could buy that considering it's a different country with a different character. And without spoiling anything, they do kind of hint at something that could definitely make that a possibility. 




 I watched Frances Ha and I really loved how it captured the mood, tone, vibe, and what life living in New York City is like. What are some other movies that really capture what life in a big city is like? Where it's almost like the city itself is a character? Whether it be NYC, Detroit, LA, Hong Kong, Tokyo, or whatever. 




 As someone who has seen the original I thought it was actually pretty good. It's not bad at all. Josh Brolin is great in it. It's shot well. It's definitely a good remake, but like I said, it did feel rushed. But all in all it was pretty good. However, I think if you have the opportunity to see the original, you have to watch it. Spike Lee's is good, but Chan Wook Park's is a masterpiece. But if you can't watch the original, then Spike Lee's is a good option. It stays pretty close to the original. 




 That's funny cause I just saw it and I thought it felt rushed. 





























 In all honesty I'd love to see Zac Efron in a really different role. Like something other than a comedy or romance movie. I think he is a talented actor, but he keeps choosing roles that are pretty boy roles. He wants to break from High School musical. He came close with the Paperboy, but he keeps playing the pretty boy. He needs to pick a role that will change his image or force him to play more than a pretty boy. Something like Christian Bales American Psycho.

Another talented actor is Robert Pattinson. Twilight may be terrible, but he was not the problem with them. He's good in what ever he does, but he keeps getting bad roles. Luckily The Rover looks really promising. 









 [Here!](http://vimeo.com/43883589) 




 Yeah, sort of. Like no one well known. Find fantastic actors who don't mind having sex, or good porno actors, and not make it sex with a story, but a story with sex. So I guess more like erotica. But have legitimately good writing, story, acting, a score, and cinematography. 

I always picture it like, "What if Terrence Malick made porn?" 




 It was just a short skateboard doc. More about the philosophical side of skateboarding. 




 I take the interstate *to* because it's quicker. I take the backroads *from* because it's beautiful. 




 The girls from The Crucible. 




 Nope. But I did work on a movie that was released in a few theaters and a documentary that won best cinematography and best short documentary. I've made a few short stuff, but nothing major. Although, I have thought about making a "good" porno before. 




 What about zombies you see in newer fiction? Zombies who are living, breathing humans infected with a virus instead of the undead. 




 I guess it depends on what you mean by movies.  




 Cold. 




 Try turning all things off that produce light (tv, night light, etc.). Make your room as dark as possible. Maybe get some white noise like a floor fan or ambient natural sounds like rain or waves. Also keep your room at a comfortable temperature (not too hot, not too cold).  




 Got me through high school 




 Learn the notes and practice. 

[UltimateGuitar](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) has tabs for just about every song. 




 Watch a movie. Nothing like losing yourself for two hours in another world. There are movies for all kinds of moods, all kinds of tastes. There's something for everyone. 




 Love :( 




 Dream job no doubt. I would fund my first feature length film and hope for the best. 




 Same it is every year: Be a better me than I was last year. 




 Made a post that was an album of screenshots of Mulan. 




 Mostly because of my religion. But even if it wasn't for my religion, I don't like needles.

Also the thought of a tattoo gives me anxiety. Having to decide what image/word I want to have on my body for the rest of my life is *too* much for me. 




 To move out west. 




 Movies and movie making. I guess it partly has to do with the escapism aspect of watching a movie. For two hours I can disappear into another world.

I love filmmaking because I love making stories and ideas a reality. I love telling stories visually. I'm good at it, and I've never really been good at anything really. When I make a film, I'm *creating art*. Which is so cool to me. I'm making something. I'm making an idea I had a reality. I'm bringing this idea to life and making it a physical thing.  




 My buns and thighs. I'm like the only guy I know who gains weight in his butt and thighs. All the other guys gain in their stomach or waist. I hate having a big booty.

Also, my face. I'm hairy everywhere else: my head, chest, arms, legs, butt, and nether regions. But for some reason I simply *cannot* grow facial hair of any kind. I'm in my twenties and I look like a chubby sixteen year old. 




 A Moment to Remember, a Korean film. I bawl my eyes out every time I watch it. It tells a story of a man and women who fall passionately in love, but their love is put to the greatest test when [Spoiler](/s "his wife develops Alzheimer's, develops dementia, and starts losing her memory. The last thirty minutes of it rips your heart right out.") 

Sounds cheesy, but it's executed perfectly and feels genuine and never comes off as cheesy or hoakey.
 




 There's a lot to pick from, but I really really love The Tree of Life. I think it's an incredible achievement in film. The fact that it can tell this ambitious, yet small story set across a cosmic, "greater power" background is incredible. This movie is very divisive I only know one person personally who liked it while the other people I know who saw it thought it was bad.

I saw it with my mother and we both cried. We could both relate to the story. I had a strict father who I knew loved me, but had a hard time showing it, and as a result I was closer to my mother than my father. The movie really resonated and affected me probably more than any other movie I saw. It's a beautiful film that tells a beautiful story and has gorgeous cinematography, visual effects, and music. With acting that reminds you that great acting doesn't have to be explicit, it can also be subtle.  




 Has to be Star Trek. The thought of just exploring the universe in what is probably one of the coolest space ships ever sounds incredible. 




 In no order

Inherent Vice

Gone Girl

Interstellar

The Raid 2

Knight of Cups (or any of the three Malick films that are supposedly coming out this year) 




 Right now it's Tarantino and Christoph Waltz. Mainly because I think they are a match made in heaven and it clearly comes across on screen. I wish they had gotten together earlier in their careers though. The more films they do together, the better.

Another match made in heaven are Nicolas Winding Refn and Ryan Gossling as well as Winding Refn and Cliff Martinez, his choice composer.   




 1. 12 Years a Slave - I've heard quite a bit of criticism about this film being "pretentious", "self-indulgent", and "over rated". I love Steve McQueen and think he is a fantastic director. 12 Years is almost a perfect movie that I think will be considered a classic. I like how it was unflinching in its portrayal of slavery. We've often seen the hard labor and verbal abuse slaves endured, but never really the physical abuse. It also has some of the best acting I've seen.

2. The Place Beyond the Pines - Another movie that has received quite a bit of criticism, more so than 12 Years. I absolutely loved how this film almost felt like a stage play. How it was clearly broken into three acts. I think the acting, directing, and music are great. Could this movie have been better? I guess, but I still thought it was fantastic. I also really loved the father-son aspect of it. I'm super close to my father and this film really resonated with me and affected me emotionally more than any film this past year.

3. Only God Forgives - Probably the most divisive movie of the year. Heavily criticized for it's lack of story and plot. I think the minimalist thing works for this film though. What it lacks in substance, it more than makes up for in style. I love Nicolas Winding Refn because he's unafraid to make the kind of movies we don't usually see. He doesn't care if you like his movies and that gives him more freedom. Only God Forgives probably has the best cinematography, set design, and score that I saw in a film last year. This movie isn't for everyone though so I understand why it's a divisive film. 




 There is /r/MoviePosterPorn 




 I actually found Looper to be underwhelming.  




 It's funny you say that because 4 isn't *that* bad and an "R" rating doesn't guarantee good. A Good Day to Die Hard returned to "R" and still was hot garbage.  




 There's a movie called This Means War about kids who have a pretend war with sticks and stuff, but you see it from their perspective so the stick guns look real and when they get shot there's blood. Pretty good movie.  




 Too bad they cut it off. 




 This has to be the *longest* Grammys yet. 




 Around $600 




 There was a post on here or r/gaming, but I'm sure it was here. It was an album of pics that turned skyrim into a desert. I can't find it anywhere. Anyone know where the post is or what the mod was called? 




 That sounds fantastic! 




 I've played hundreds of hours of Skyrim on consoles. I've finally decided to build a pc!

My question isn't necessarily "What are the must have mods?" My question is, what mods will freshen up the game and breath new life in it and change it up enough for someone who has spent hundreds of hours in this world? 




 You do know the first rule of being a troll is to not tell people you're a troll, right? Otherwise what's the point? 




 What does it do? 




 I don't want to out myself. 




 I'd change r/funny to r/AmeteurNight 




 Lost a lot of weight and got in shape. I'm now overweight again. Maybe *this* time they'll notice. 




 Movies have been around for a hundred years. Video games have only been around for only like half that at most. And they *were* originally created as a kid's toy sort of. But nowadays games are growing. They *are* a valid and great form of storytelling. I think in maybe thirty years it will get there. Honestly it probably won't be until graphics in games are nearly undistinguished from reality that they will be taken as seriously by *everyone*.  




 Injuries that involve bones breaking.  




 It's not high school. 




 I stayed awake for like 3 days once in Boy Scouts because we were cooking a lot of butts for a fundraiser. 




 I have to poop with my pants and underwear completely off. Like not around my ankles. Like off of me. It feels restrictive, and when I feel restricted I can't poop. 




 1. Graduating high school because I didn't take it seriously and almost didn't graduate.

2. Close second was becoming an Eagle Scout. I wasn't super into Boy Scouts, but I was so close to getting my Eagle and my parents really wanted me to do it, so I did. It made my parents super proud of me which makes me happy. In retrospect, I'm glad I didn't give up entirely.  




 Sausage, beef, steak, six kinds of cheese, extra cheese, and white sauce instead of standard red pizza sauce. 




 Probably still in Memphis. Damn. Hopefully I'll be at least close to getting married to someone. Hopefully have a house. Hopefully I'll be a professor somewhere out west. 




 The toys I had. Kids today, and of the future, all their toys are electronics. Mp3 players, tablets, phones, etc. *My* toys were action figures, board games, stuffed animals, etc. These things still exist, but no child today wants these. When I was a kid all I wanted were G.I. Joes. Last year, my friends kid was asking him for an Xbox One, an ipad, and a moped. 




 Ate a lot. 




 Not really. I had probably close to twenty friends in high school. So far I only keep in touch with like four or five of them and only hang out frequently with like two of them.

With work and college, not only do you find it hard to keep in touch and get together with old friends, but you meet new ones. 




 I was babied pretty hard growing up. My parents never made me get a job and spoiled me and my sister. This led to me not being prepared for being on my own in the real world. Still love my parents to death, though. 




 So I'm 20 and I've only had two jobs. One was for a place I worked at for only a month before leaving for school. I went to school for a year. Then I got another job. I had every intention of keeping this job. However I was laid off after only a month because "they couldn't afford to keep me on."

My question is, when applying for a job, should I leave off the second job? My mother said I should because it makes me look bad because it looks like I quit jobs after only a month. But I said I *should* put my second job because experience is experience, even if it is just an extra month.

Is putting on the second job on applications hurting my chances of getting a job? 




 Fags are going to hell and shouldn't be given any rights, we already made this mistake once with black people, don't let it happen again. 




 Clothes, movies, definitely junk food. 




 I guess pretty far. Mine would suggest it was long. 




 Today I learned 




 I thought it had a fantastic first three quarters that were filled with suspense and great directing, but that last quarter turned into a generic possession/exorcism scene. 




 A 2001: A Space Odyssey remake directed by J.J. Abrams starring Brad Pitt and featuring Matthew McConaughey as HAL. 




 Blue Valentine. Very sad, tragic and beautiful movie. 




 Man the last thirty minutes of this movie are absolutely fantastic!  




 It's a shame we likely won't see this movie anytime soon, if at all. 




 Charlie's Angels. Yeah the movie is dumb, but I think Rockwell kills it. 




 Bad posture.  




 She knows 




 Can they be purchased? Would love to have one in the dining room or hearth room.  














 I love movies that have spy stuff, secret agent stuff, undercover stuff, and surveillance stuff. But not James Bond movies, movies like Zero Dark Thirty and Body of Lies. Like the more realistic and maybe even more politically charged ones. The Bourne movies are another example. What are some similar movies?  




 Don't forget glamorous! 




 Any lyric that rhymes a word with the same exact word. 

Also, "Baby can you breathe?/ I got this from Jamaica/ It always works for me-heeeee"

In that weird whisper voice of his.  




 I don't know, if my phone rings or I get a text, I'll see who it is. If it's my sister it's usually an emergency because she never calls me unless it's important. It's always usually a text. My phone shows me a preview of a text and if it appears to be an emergency, I'll look at it, but if it's just a mundane message it can wait.  




 I chew with my mouth closed in public but when I'm around my immediate family, I don't monitor how I chew. Is this still rude? 









 They can be comic strips, graphic novels, or anything. Just not a super hero themed one. 




 Really beautiful! Can someone with more knowledge than me explain what RAW is and what shooting in it does? 




 That's what I'm wondering. Why post this when the casting appears to already be over? 




 I'm shooting a documentary and I'm looking to get some nice skyline and rooftop shots of Memphis. What are some places where I can do this? 




 I'm not saying critics are always right. I love plenty of movies critics call "terrible." But ratings act as a guideline for people. Most people don't have the time to pick just any movie and hope its good. They want it to be worth their time. They want to know it will be good. The unfortunate truth is that a lot of horror movies are poorly rated, which hurts the genre. Now smaller, creative, and good horror movies don't get seen. Critics are most definitely not always right, but they do have a HUGE influence on what people watch.  




 Yeah I thought the zombie pov was super creative, but I guess I'm just so over zombies. Also, in all honesty, the eyeball one, while kinda cool in concept, was sooo dumb.  




 I agree, but I think the way to do it is to set up jump scares that don't happen. Here's a comment I made earlier. 

"See the thing about jump scares is that they are only suppose to happen twice. Once at the beginning and once at the end. The point of the first one is to put the audience on edge. Showing them that anything can pop out at any minute. What makes this effective is that by not having a jump scare again, you put the audience in suspense of something that won't happen again. That's why the jump scare is genius. You make them think it can happen at anytime but don't. The point of the second and final jump scare is for the payoff. Now that the audience has been waiting the entire time for the next jump scare, they let their guard down because it's been like an hour or so. That's when you let loose the second and final jump scare.

That's how jump scares are suppose to work, but people instead decide to make that the scary part and put them in every 5-10 minutes."

That's how jump scares are suppose to work, but people instead decide to make that the scary part and put them in every 5-10 minutes.  




 That's what I hear. I only saw part of the first season. Is it more supernatural stuff like ghosts or what? 




 I'm not saying horror movies need to be big budget, I'm just curious as to why everyone believes story, writing, and acting have to take a backseat instead of riding shotgun along *with* the horror.  




 I dunno. I always felt comedy is the hardest because it's the most subjective and broadest subject. I feel like it's pretty universal what most consider scary and horrific. Sure, there are specific phobias like heights, spiders, the ocean, etc that some find scary that others don't. But I think everyone can agree that murderers, creatures, and being alone in a dark haunted place is scary. I do think however that it's easier to creep people out than to all out scare them. I personally find subtle stuff like shadows moving in the background or footprints leading under the bed far more scarier than "in your face" stuff.  




 Inside, Martyrs, and The Devil's Backbone are fantastic! But Martyrs felt less like a horror movie and more like a depressing drama with horrific things happening to this person. Which I guess now that I've written that out could be considered a horror movie.  




 True, but I feel like with action and rom-coms, we may rarely see great ones, but we kinda consistently see decent ones. Whereas with horror, it's rare to come across even decent ones. Especially horror movies made by big studios.  




 The entirety of Enter the Void feels like a dream sequence because of how surreal it is. 

The shining also has some creepy dream sequences. 

And the obvious choice would have to be Inception.  




 I actually really want to see we are what we are. I hear it's great 




 It was the cult one with all the kids. Or was that the first VHS?

Edit: Yes it was the second one. The segment was titled "Safe Haven." 




 The problem with VHS 2 is that there is really only one part of it that is good and it's only 20 minutes out of an hour and a half.

As for the indie stuff, I agree that there are quite a few that I hear are good but I just don't know how to watch them without buying them. 




 I started thinking about this while browsing the horror section of Netflix. There tends to be a lot more horror movies that are bad compared to other genres. In fact, it's quite rare we see good horror movies anymore. Horror movies tend to hang around a 6 or below on IMDB or a 50 or below on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. The most recent good horror movie I can think of is The Conjuring. Which had a great first 3 quarters, but the last quarter turned into a pretty generic possession scene.

Why is this the case? What's the cause of this? Is it the over saturation of them? Is it because they're generally easier to make on a low budget or what? It seems like the only truly good horror movies, with a few exceptions, are foreign now. Is it because most directors/writers/producers believe that story, acting, writing, and character development aren't as important in the horror genre? 




 Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line Criterion Collection is considered one of the best Bluray transfers. Also, Samsara is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. 

The Tree of Life is pretty killer as well.

If you want to find out which blurays are worth getting, [blu-ray.com](http://www.blu-ray.com/) has just about every bluray reviewed based on video, audio, and special features. 




 His other brother was also in a movie called Electick Children. A movie about a teen girl who becomes impregnated by rock music. 




 When Ohio is for Lovers came out I thought it was the sickest! 




 I know every lyric to this song. 









 I love Terrence Malick so much! 




 [The Divide](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1535616/?ref_=nv_sr_2)

A movie about a group of people who take shelter in a basement after a nuclear attack. As days go by, their mental, emotional, and physical states start breaking down. It's a great scifi drama that focuses on the conflict between these people. Criminally underrated and filled with fantastic acting, music, and cinematography.

[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLpieSNIfk). Kind of cheesy trailer that doesn't due justice to the movie. 




 I really liked Martyrs. I can't say I enjoyed it obviously. It's something I don't EVER want to watch again, but it's a unique movie and I'm glad I own it. 




 At a 5.8, the lowest I have is The Divide. Not super low because I actively avoid getting bad movies unless I love them. I love this movie. I wouldn't even call it bad. This is a REALLY good sci fi movie. It's about a group of people who retreat into a small bomb shelter during a nuclear war. The more time they spend in the shelter, the crazier and more unhinged they become.

It's not the best movie, but it has some fantastic acting, music, and cinematography. It all takes place in the shelter. Some want to go out. Others obviously don't. Who will break? Who will survive?

This movie also takes some interesting turns as the peoples mental, emotional, and physical state break down.

I came to own it after watching it online. I was looking for something to watch and it looked good, but I was not expecting what I got. After watching it, I had to take some time to let it sink in. It stuck with me days after I saw it. There is a haircut scene that was one of the best scenes of that year. It's a dark, bleak, and emotionally draining movie.

I would totally recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys sci fi that is more about the human drama and how humans react to disaster and tragedy. It's one of my favorite movies I own and it's so good. 




 1. Memphis, TN

2. August 4

3. I love a good crime movie, also really love surreal and mind bending stuff.

4. Either Spy Kids or Charlie's Angels.

5. Definitely Charlies Angels

6. In The Name of the King

7. I love Terrence Malick, David Fincher, Christopher Nolan, and Coen Brothers. Those are the only directors that I've liked everything they've done.

8. Either Enter the Void, The Thin Red Line, or Tree of Life.

9. As of right now, the bluray of The Chaser. Or a directors collection of any of the directors I listed.

10. Alphabetical of course!

11. Amazon wish list keeps track of the ones I want

[Here's](http://imgur.com/a/h5dec#0) my collection after about a year or so of collecting! Looking forward to adding more!

 




 Enter the Void actually isn't all that disturbing. It's weird, strange, and trippy. It has some uncomfortable scenes, but it's definitely far from being one of the most disturbing films. It's actually a really cool movie from a technical and visual standpoint. 




 His name is Joel David Moore 




 So that's why she was nominated and will probably win. The Oscars just want a story. 




 I kinda agree, but I feel like I don't know enough about cinematography or the production of Gravity to say for sure.  




 Someone in the Golden Globes thread said this about Lawrence, "Her name alone gets her awards." Which I think is totally true.  




 I think while Gravity was remarkable technically, I think it is the weakest contender for best picture. There really isn't a lot of substance there that *I* could see story wise and the writing was okay. But I think the other films are all around great not just technically, but also story wise, acting wise, writing, etc. I just think the other noms are more well rounded. 

That said, Gravity should take all technical awards.  




 I know this movie has gotten a lot of hate, but I thought the cinematography and score in Only God Forgives was fantastic. But I guess there was no way it'd get a nom. 

It would've been nice to see Place Beyond the Pines get a nod, but it's a stiff competition so there was really no room for it. 

All in all though I think there is a good bit of variety this year with the noms. Only thing I wish there was less of is American Hustle.  




 Honestly, I'm quite happy with the nominations. A lot of variety. Of course there are some snubs, there always are. But they did good this year. Only thing I'd like to see less of is American Hustle.  




 I know it's a longshot and was never going to happen, but no cinematography nom for Spring Breakers or Only God Forgives? I know it may not be a good movie but OGF was easily one of the most beautiful movies of the year. Also had a great score.  




 Just a question: Have you met every soldier? 




 You are *literally creating and giving life.* How is that selfish?  




 I believe in God and am a full on Christian, even Mormon. I do *NOT* let my religious and moral beliefs corrupt or interfere with my political or social views in any way. I'm able to separate the two. 




 Yeah I'm with you. I beat my child last week because he was being a fag. I mean, he just kept doing fag stuff. So I beat him and now *I'm* the bad guy? If he didn't want to be beaten then he should've 1) Stopped doing fag stuff, and 2) stood up to me. But he's a fag so obviously he didn't fight back. 




 I dunno dude. I partly agree with you. I was bullied super hard in elementary/early middle school. I'm in my 20s and looking back on it now, I wish I could go back with the spine I have now and put that bully in his place.

But that's kind of the thing. When you're a kid, like really young, you don't really understand that what a bully says isn't true. You're impressionable and you take it to heart. It isn't really until you're in your teens you start to learn to let things roll off your back.

But again, I kind of agree with you. 




 That's not entirely fair. 




 Exactly. There's more to the legalization of marijuana than "Stoners want it." There are plenty of economic benefits that could come from the legalization of marijuana. People who are against it obviously don't understand this and need to separate their own morals from the greater good. 




 It's funny you say you haven't seen any good arguments in favor, but I actually wrote a paper about the legalization of marijuana. I didn't really have an opinion on whether it should be legalized or not, but after discovering the economic benefits of its legalization I'm all for it! 




 I dunno dude. I went to school with a guy who killed himself. He had severe social anxiety as well as aspergers. He couldn't handle social stuff very well. This led to harsh bullying which led to depression. He eventually stopped going to school because he couldn't handle it and one day took his life.

There *are* some people who just are *not* in the right frame of mind.

I don't know though, maybe you're right, but sometimes there *are* other elements at play that mess with your head. Sometimes it isn't just depression. The human mind is a crazy thing. 




 What's the likelihood of running into scams on memphisflyer compared to craigslist?  




 I know I should, but I'm not about to go 45 while everyone around me is going 60-something. The last thing my anxiety needs while driving is people honking at me, yelling at me, and/or riding me. 




 I think something like [this](http://www.inc.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/preview/slideshows/03_9.jpg) may work. With or without the mustache. If you do choose to keep it, trim it on the sides some.

Also, because you have similar features, there's 

[This](http://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/wennpic/joel-david-moore-premiere-savages-01.jpg)

Also [this](http://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ENT_JoelDavidMoore_1009.jpg)

Honestly, I'd say go with either the second or third pic, shave the mustache, but keep the stubble. 




 My gamertag is my reddit username. None of my friends play so I rarely play. Would love to play with some people! 




 Same here. I'm not really good at it, but would love to participate. Seems like a lot of fun. 




 DBC? 




 I don't think so. We've seen the labor and verbal abuse slaves endured, but never really the physical abuse. 




 But probably not.

Edit: So happy I was wrong. 




 I honestly think it's because there was no more room in the Drama category. 




 So I don't have HBO, but True Detective looks really great. I love detective movies and tv shows. So is there another way I can legally watch True Detective? 









 I'm so glad he did though. I wanted it to be him or Fassbender. 




 Which sucks. I love Jennifer Lawrence but how did it not go to Lupita? 




 Or Lupita 














 Someone mentioned they'd love for Tarantino to do a 60s era spy film. I thought that sounded right in his realm.  




 I'm so excited for another Tarantino movie. But I'm just a little bummed out that it's a western. I love westerns, but I'd much rather see Tarantino do something else in a different time period or location. I'm sure it'll be great though! 




 The body of Henry Cavil and the voice of Benedict Cumberbatch. 




  I ordered a PPV movie when I was like 8-10. I thought the dude and chick were conjoined twins. 




 I think because it was one of the first movies to take an extraordinary situation and make it ordinary. Pulp Fiction was one of the first movies to be filled with dialogue and conversations that normal people would have. They were realistic. Not everything they said was important to the story or was dramatic. A lot of people don't like the whole "talk about nothing" style. But I loved it. It made it feel more realistic. In the beginning, Travolta and Jackson aren't talking about anything important or meaningful. They're talking about tv and fast food.

But on top of all that, it's just a well written, well acted, and well directed movie. 




 Hot Wheels.

In a dystopian future, the most popular sport is car racing. But the cars are super fast. Going up to 500 mph. The tracks are filled with crazy turns, jumps, and loops, making it the most dangerous sport. A young man, who has dreamed of being one of the best racers attempts to make his dream a reality. 




 See I don't see Jeremy Renner pulling off the comedy parts. I think he's a perfectly capable actor though. 




 They do actually snort it. It's uncomfortable, but harmless. 




 Like I said, my blue sky analogy sucked and was not meant to be taken literally. Just as a way to put things into perspective.

Well Jesus was whipped and had a crown of thorns placed on his head and, apparently, bled from every pore. He was covered in blood, yet when he was resurrected his scars were gone and the blood was clean from his body.

You're exactly right. We *do* have to consider that maybe other religions are right.

Look, I'm just going to assume that you have no intention of coming to any sort of agreement and you just want to argue. I'm trying to compromise with you, but you won't. I can't tell if you're asking these questions and pointing this stuff out because you actually want explanations or because you're trying to prove that all Gods and religions are all just a lie. So let me know. Are you *really* interested in answers? Are you asking because you want to believe? Or because you want to prove something? 




 I think it depends on what *you* like and also, who you're seeing it with.

I loved Wolf of Wall Street, but depending on who you see it with, it can get pretty uncomfortable. If you're going with family or a girlfriend/boyfriend, I'd say Lone Survivor. But if you're going with a buddy, you can't go wrong with either. I loved Wolf of Wall Street *and* Lone Survivor. But I thought Lone Survivor was more entertaining. That's just me though.

But again, it depends on what you like and who you're seeing it with. 




 It's cliche, but I want to improve my health. I used to be in good shape. Now my pants and shirts are tight, ripped a few pants actually. It makes me sad. I want to lose weight and get back in shape. I want to look and feel good. 




 Jamaica. I didn't feel safe there. Does this make me racist? No one there did anything to make me afraid, but I felt uncomfortable. 

Anyone who has been to Jamaica a few times or lives there know if it's actually dangerous or if it's pretty cool? 
























 Man I wish I knew how to do custom covers. Those custom Harry Potter covers are sick! 




 It really sucks how the UK gets all the cool steelbooks. Really wish the US would get some. 




 Why? Out of respect? If so, why? I mean, it's not based on the Malaysian flight. Hollywood doesn't seem like the kind of business to really care about anything but money. In fact it's weird that they don't want to capitalize on it. Besides, this is a movie that probably wouldn't be released for another year or so. I don't disagree with their choice but it's strange.  




 Whether it be by telling you how it ends before you saw it, or pointing out something that you can't unsee or hear. 

What movie was ruined for you by someone else and how? 




 Honestly, I only think two of Kubrick's films are great. 




 I'd love to hear why you think Inglorious Basterds is one of the worst movies you've seen. 




 I agree with all of your points. Also, Tree of Life is one of my all time favorite films. 









 "Then I woke up." 









 I only know this from An Extremely Goofy Movie.  




 Haha well I just got off work so I'll get in contact with you in like an hour 




 You know what? I just might skype you. Are you available after 8? Cause I really do need someone to walk me through it in real time.

 I can't edit clips independently anymore now. Now I have to create a new project and drag the sequence into a new time line which combines everything. I can't adjust single clips and what not. How can I fix this? I don't want to re-edit the entire thing all over again!   




 FCP 7. I don't know what my sequence/project settings are or the export/master file settings.

I have run into another problem though. So on this project I have put 30 hours into, I accidentally closed the sequence timeline. Now the timeline won't open for this specific project unless I create a new project and drag the sequence into this new timeline. Problem is, when I do this it makes it all one big sequence where I can't see the beginning or ending of clips. I also have to re-render everything which will take two hours.

How can I fix this mistake? Can I even fix it? I just want to edit independent clips again without having to re-edit every single thing all over again. Did I royally screw up?

Edit: Never mind about the timeline thing. Fixed it! But I do still need help exporting. How do I check the settings? 




 So I shot something in 1080p 24fps. I've edited it and I'm ready for exporting. The problem is no matter what I do, it ALWAYS IS TERRIBLE QUALITY!! The aspect ratio is distorted and the image is blurry/pixelated. 

I've watched so many different tutorials about exporting, all with the same result, Bad Quality. For some reason I just can't get it to work. It's so irritating. 

The worst part is that I've exported a video that came out in high quality before, but I can't get this video I just did to come out in HD at all for some reason.

Can someone please, please help?  




 But you should watch "Them" which is a French film from like 2007 I think. Basically The Strangers in France however it is much much scarier.  




 What is this from 




 Links are more than welcomed! 

I was thinking about this while I was listening to the live version of Dave Matthews "Crush" and finding that I loved it more than the studio version. 

What are some of your examples of this? 




 Links are more than welcomed and are encouraged, but don't worry about it! 









 Spy/secret agent films. I love love love these kinds of movies. Unfortunately the only good ones we get now are really just Bond but I love this genre. 

More specifically I love mountain climbing movies like Vertical Limit and A Lonely Place to Die. We rarely get movies like this though which is a bummer. 

Someone already said this one so I won't go into detail, but I absolutely love crime movies. I'll almost always pick a crime movie over any other.  









 Honestly, Terrence Malick. He makes beautiful films with beautiful people. He's probably the only director who could seamlessly transition into that industry.  









 I personally just felt that it was very mediocre compared to the first and had bad cgi, bad cinematography and often hammy performances. 

The first one felt like a masterpiece whereas this one felt like a cheap direct to dvd sequel.  




 It was basically a four square shot of a stand up comedian's joke about Tiger Woods claiming to be a sex addict. The post seems to have just vanished 




 The majority of people think Johnny Cash's cover of Hurt is better? 




 Too bad it's also 10% as good as the first one.  




 It's weird we have to learn to protect ourselves from the very people paid to protect *us*.  




 So there was a story about I think a WWII pilot who was flying in the Bahamas and disappeared. They then found the wreckage off the coast of Florida and never figured out how he got there. 

I could be remembering all the details wrong, but that was the basic gist of it.  




 I didn't mention it but you are so totally right. 

The first 300 only really used cgi for the background, blood, and the cases where that's the only option(like the army of millions of Persians and the creatures) but even then it wasn't terrible. The cgi in Rise of an Empire felt very fake and a lot of the time unnecessary.  




 So I'm definitely in the minority here based on the rest of these comments. 

I found this movie kind of boring. I don't know why but I never got into it at all. 

The blood looked super terrible. I think it might have been worse than the blood in the first one, which evaporated in the air. Like it was very distracting how bad it was. 

The cinematography was mediocre. You know how that show Spartacus felt like a cheap rip off of 300 when it came out? That's how this one felt, a cheap rip off. I found it very hard to tell what was going on at any time because of the either too dark lighting, or too bright and bloomy lighting. 

I feel like this isn't hardly half the movie the first one was. I was more interested in this movie when it was called Xerxes and was about his origins which was only 10 minutes of this movie. 

All in all I thought it was very poor and a disappointing sequel to one of my favorite movies. Again, I know I'm in the minority here but these are just my thoughts on it.  









 If /r/truefilm seems intimidating, /r/casualfilm is a great place. Easily my favorite subreddit.  




 I was wondering when someone would say this. I've seen just about all the movies people have said in this thread. 

Martyrs is possibly the darkest and most depressing movie I've ever seen. It made me feel ill.  




 I really love movies where a character is constantly being hunted or is hunting someone else throughout the entire movie. I find that these types of movies make for some really suspenseful and thrilling experiences.

What some good movies like this? 




 I was thinking about this at work today. Are the some good movies where the good guy(s) and bad guy(s) end up having to team up for some reason? Maybe fighting a common enemy? 




 Yep this is it exactly 




 So this dude came into my work looking for crystal rocks and metal shavings. He goes on to tell me about the "____ in the air" How it's in the snow and rain and is like fiberglass falling from the sky. 

Anyone know what this is? What it's called? He kinda sounded crazy so he might not be accurate but when he said this one word, the word I'm looking for, I knew what he was talking about. He said, "Have you heard about ____?" 









 Wow this was totally my idea in the first place as a joke, but I'm happy someone is actually making it happen! Exciting!

 I honestly don't think anyone could do Archer. What makes Archer Archer isn't his looks, it's his voice, which no one could do.  




 Note: I have not seen Dallas Buyers Club. 

I would have given it Best Supporting Actor and Best Actor as well as Best Director. That said, I'm really happy Jared and Matthew won in those categories because I really love them and wish them the best.  




 It's just that exactly. Hype. 




 It's not as great as all the hype and awards would lead someone who hasn't seen it to believe. Much better movies have won less. 




 Children of Men is a better movie and got no oscars 




 Children of Men is better and won no oscars. 




 It won't 




 Honestly I didn't even know it had music until the final scene. 




 That's still hoping for a lot. I loved Her but hype is a powerful thing. As much as I want Her to win, I wouldn't be surprised if it lost. I hope I'm wrong. 




 See everyone says this and I think it doesn't sound like the compliment people mean it to be. You say it with good intentions, but it's actually a knock against a movie if it's not as good in one format as it is in another format. Anyone who says "see it in theaters" or "see it in 3D" are basically saying that it won't be as good on a small screen or in 2D unintentionally. 




 Yeah Lubezki did and is a fantastic cinematographer 




 That movie was robbed of its cinematography award. 




 AMA for the pizza dude 




 He even gave it to someone else just like the real one would do. 




 So sort of like Ridley Scott with Alien. How he managed to not only create a movie, but an iconic universe as well? 









 We've seen threads before about who we think are great directors, writers, actors, etc., but what do you think *makes* these filmmakers great? What makes a great filmmaker? 









 But how difficult is this to do as someone with little to no audio experience. Just figuring out what I'd need seems like a big challenge. 




 That's fair. I should've said that while on Amazon it says $600, I actually found one on sale somewhere for around $350, which I guess, is still more. 




 Are they bad simply because they *are* actually bad? Or is the Bose actually good but you're saying it's bad because there are better options? 

I just simply don't have the time to learn about audio and have an entire day or more of trial and error figuring out how to make it all work. 

I'm not saying your input is bad, any and all input is greatly appreciated, I'm just trying to figure out if the Bose is a decent sound system, not compared to something I could build better, but as far as packaged home systems go.  




 So we got our tax refund and we want to buy a sound system for our home theater. Right now we're deciding between these two. I was wondering if I could get advice on which is better because I know very little about audio.

 Fall/winter I have this old Plugg jacket from 8th grade. Still fits and looks great. It's olive green and has a nice taper in the sleeves and waist. I've had it for close to 10 years. Very very durable. It's been through a lot. 

In the spring/summer it's black basketball shorts. That's what I wear *all* the time when it's hot. Not really fashionable, I know, but because they are solid black they look decent for these hot summers my city's known for.  




 It's like 6-10 hours depending on traffic and stops 




 Yeah Dallas is kind of far for me to drive unfortunately but it's the closest she'll be to me the entire tour so it's worth it 




 I might end up going alone if a friend can't go. It'd be nice to hang out pre show or maybe, if by some chance, our seats are near each other, during the show. Concerts are always weird by yourself. At least for me they are. Anyway, just curious. 




 I really love Born This Way. It was the first song of hers that I heard and really loved. Before that I had just been a casual fan who listened to her on the radio. I also love Bad Romance, Monster, and my favorite might be Dope. I love how personal and reserved it feels compared to most of her songs. 

It's hard to pick just one from Artpop because that whole album is more my style. 




 Thanks! Another question, how worth it is general admission? I know this is more of a personal preference sort of thing but how much more am I going to get out of the show if I do GA vs regular seating? Is it worth waiting in line all day, to you personally? It's just that I've never done GA before. 

You also said if I showed up later, I'd get the back. How terrible is the back of GA? Last one, is there a chance that if I showed up late for GA that they'd run out of room and I wouldn't get in?

Again sorry for all the questions. You're very helpful! 




 So I have a question, does this mean I'd have to wait there all day to get in? Like, for example, if I get there at 8 am, do I have to wait there in line until like 8 pm or whenever it starts, to get in? Or can I chow up at 8 am, get a ticket, leave, then come back when the show starts? Also, how much are GA tickets?

Sorry for bombarding you with questions, you just seem like you know. Thanks in advance! 




 I cried during the last scene.  




 I can't even comprehend this, it's so great. 




 I think *Gravity* is *way* too high up on this list I think it's the most surprising one. I kind of expected it to be on the list, but definitely not that high up.. I can't believe the movies that it's ranked higher than. Should definitely be in the 200's at most. I know this list is less about "best" and more about "favorite", but even by that standard *Gravity* has to be one of the more overrated ones on this list. 




 Naw the song I'm looking for is far more recent. 




 It was a female singer. Obviously she didn't really say "something", but I can't for the life of me remember what the lyrics are or what song. 

Any ideas? 




 Lights out!

Guerrilla radio! 




 Yeah he's still young and impressionable. I'm sure him seeing all this stuff must really mess him up.  




 I choose a movie based on what my mood is at that time. Like am I in the mood for crime, action, comedy, etc. as well as sub-genre stuff like dark movies, violent, gritty, depressing, fast paced, light-hearted, etc.

A good way to find subgenres is Netflix. You can find a vast list of sub-genres or you can find a movie you've seen that is close to what you want to watch in tone and Netflix will say "This movie is: Violent, dark, etc." and will tell you what tone it is. You can then click on, let's say "dark" if I wanted to watch a dark movie, and Netflix will list all of the movies it has for instant that are categorized as dark.  




 1993 - either Jurassic Park or Schindlers List. Probably Jurassic Park.  









 Like when something happens in a movie that you've been waiting or wanting to happen. Or when a character dies or when something happens in a movie that you just find so satisfying.  




 Its just always fascinated me how a games graphics could be so heavily improved but I don't understand how it's done.  




 It's like Russian roulette for your mouth.  




 The food storm in Kazaam. When Max wishes it will rain junk food and it just French fries, burgers, candy, and pancakes everywhere.  




 I completely agree that sequels work for comic book movies. It makes sense. I'm just saying for me personally I'm not a huge fan of sequels. 

And as for comic book movies taking over original films. I guess I just meant adaptations and remakes in general. As the years go on, the number of original films are getting smaller and smaller. Everything is based on a comic or book or a remake or sequel or reboot. I can't say I blame Hollywood. If I knew a specific thing would sell, I'd make it too. 

And again, adaptations of comic books and remakes and what not wouldn't bother me if they did something interesting with them. But they all feel the same which makes me feel jaded towards them.  




 I dislike the Godfather a great deal, but I recognize its a great film.  




 I can honestly see Shia making a comeback in like 5 or so years. Just imagine it for a second. He makes a huge mistake and decides to roll with it. For the next five years he disappears from the public eye. And when he does appear, everything he says is a quote from someone else. Then after years of being hidden he comes out of nowhere starring in a film with a great director and blows us all away.  




 I'm not really into them honestly. They aren't bad though. I really love the Nolan Batmans though because they didn't *feel* like a comic book movie, if that makes sense. When they first made an impression in like 2008 I liked them but I feel like now there is just such an over saturation of them. Honestly for me, my main problem is the fact that they are sequels and adaptations. It sounds shallow, but I'd much rather see an original film than another Marvel or DC movie. But it wasn't this way like 5 or 6 years ago because there weren't so many. We use to get super hero stuff like every two years or so. Now we get them every year. Sometimes two or more a year. 

I also don't like, and this is more a flaw with Hollywood than super hero films themselves, that producers are just looking for properties and franchises to adapt or remake simply because they know it will sell, thus creating less and less original content. These days, comic book movies are replacing original films. It used to be adaptations were made along side original films. Now it feels they are taking the place of original films. Again though, this is more a problem with Hollywood. 

I'm not totally against super hero stuff as long as they change it up or do something interesting with it. That's why I loved the Nolan Batmans. But now, every Marvel movie looks the same and every DC movie looks the same. They all look and feel the same. That combined with how frequently we see them makes them feel super dull and dry to me. 

Like 10 years ago, I'd be so pumped for the next super hero movie. Now, they just aren't special anymore. At least to me it feels that way.  




 This is actually pretty true! I went through a bunch of guys with their penises all out then they would leave immediately when they saw I was a dude. Then this one dude didn't leave immediately so we started talking and had a really nice conversation. Turned out to be a pretty cool guy.

 And the best thing about Jurassic Park 3.  




 Mayo? 




 I don't think Beyond the Black Rainbow is particularly great, but I do love that movie.  




 This is seriously a fantastic movie! 




 I honestly don't remember anything about this movie but I *do* remember liking it.  




 Wait, Dancer in the Dark is on streaming? I've always wanted to see it.  




 This is sort of why I hope Gravity doesn't win best picture, not that I think it will, but hype is a powerful thing. Especially in an awards show that has slowly become a popularity contest. I think Gravity is really good, but I've always thought that best picture should be reserved for timeless films. Films that are just as great and just as powerful no matter the format, no matter the screen size. I agree that Gravity will lose a lot of its powerfulness with its transition to small screens. The same happened with Avatar.  




 I'm subscribed to a few youtubers who do reviews that I trust. I also look at the discussion threads on /r/movies that they have every week. I find that I trust the opinion of the general public more than a pro reviewer. I don't know why, I just do for some reason.

For the most part though I generally don't look at reviews. If it's something I want to see, then I'll go see it. If it's something I don't really have an interest in seeing, then I'll likely stay away from it for the time being.  




 What if there's no IMAX near OP? And if there is, what if it's not playing? Will he/she have a lesser viewing experience? 




 I'm not really into ghosts or possession movies, but I love creature films with physical creatures or monsters. What are some decent ones besides the classic ones like Black Lagoon, Wolfman, etc.? Like more recent ones?

Edit: When I said classics I should have been more clear. I meant the ones people always say as well like Alien and the Thing. I meant more recent and more obscure creature films.  




 I'm looking at a bunch of steelbooks and about 90% of them are region b, or the UK, or only just Europe. Is there a reason for this? Why doesn't America get them as well? 




 I want to find more rare editions or limited editions of movies, but the thing is, I don't know which movies have other versions or editions. Is there a website that list them or I can use as a resource? 




 I watched Punch Drunk Love, and I was wondering if you guys had any favorite unconventional love stories in movies. It doesn't necessarily have to be a romance movie either.  




 I really *really* love the big forest scenery in movies like The Hunted and even the Twilight movies have nice forest scenes. Are there any movies that take place predominately in the forests of Washington or Canada? Or even Alaska? Or other forests/wilderness like the ones found in north eastern America and Canada? 




 What are your favorite box arts or covers? Whether they be special editions, steelbooks, or just regular covers, which are your favorites? I'm a big fan of the box art for [The Thin Red Line Criterion Collection](http://www.amazon.com/Thin-Line-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B003KGBIRA/ref=sr_1_3?s=movies-tv ie=UTF8 qid=1391655340 sr=1-3 keywords=the+thin+red+line) 




 See I disagree with this because everyone has *their own* problems. All of my problems *are* relevant to me. That's what makes the *my* problems. If they were irrelevant to me then they aren't my problems. Everyone's problems, no matter how big or small, are relevant to them. Maybe not to someone else, but to them they are. My complains and problems may be less important than someone else's but that doesn't make them less important to me. Like when I was younger and I would complain about having hard homework and my mother would make a comment about third world children not even having a school. I understand that it's a big problem, but it doesn't make my homework any easier, it just puts things into perspective. 




 I watched a movie called [Three O'Clock High](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094138/?ref_=nv_sr_1). I love love *love* this movie. It's about your average high schooler, Jerry Mitchell, who finds himself challenged to fight the new guy, Buddy Revell.

Buddy is the new guy who, according to rumors, is a psychopath. He doesn't like to be touched. The last guy who touched him had his arm broken. Buddy is your typical bad boy. He wars boots, jeans, black leather jacket, and a white t-shirt. When Jerry Mitchell introduces himself, he puts his foot in his mouth and can tell he's making Buddy angry. In an attempt to fix the situation, Jerry asks if they can start over and gives Buddy a nice friendly pat on the shoulder. Psycho Buddy warns Jerry of what he's done and tells him that they are going to fight in the parking lot at 3 o'clock. Jerry then spends the movie trying to get out of it by any means possible.

This movie is exceptionally well made. The pacing, directing, and camera work are all absolutely fantastic.It's such an easy movie to watch because of how well paced it is. We constantly aware of what time it is and how much time Jerry has left. I cannot stress enough how fantastically well made this movie is. It's so much fun.

The thematic elements we see and hear throughout the film are really well done. For example, Jerry is in Biology and watching the Wonderful World of Insects. We hear the narrator describing the grasshopper who is going about his day and is preyed upon by the large crab scorpion. Another instance in English when we hear about the gladiator battles.

All in all this movie is great. If you're a fan of movies that take place in a day, this is one of the best ones. It's well made with fantastic direction and the pacing is great. It's an immensely fun movie and I highly recommend it.  




 So just yesterday I watched [Exam](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1258197/?ref_=nv_sr_1) which is about a group of people who are all competing for a high ranking job at a top of the line company. They must decide whether to work together or alone in order to figure out the simple yest complicated test they are given that puts them to their limits.

This film is a very tight psychological mystery. It opens with eight applicants who enter a testing room. They are greeted by their test giver who gives them a few simple rules to follow. They are told there is one question and only one answer. However they must figure out what the question is as well as the answer in under 80 minutes.

We spend the movie in an almost real-time fashion watching these people trying to solve this strange mystery. It's hard to describe without spoiling it, and this is not something you want spoiled. The acting is mostly good while occasionally, but rarely, coming off as hammy. The writing is pretty tight while rarely being cheesy. The stand out in this film is the story.

This is a very interesting mystery puzzle of a story. Why are these people here? What's the job? What's the company? Why is the application process like this? What's the question? What's the answer? Over the course of the movie we watch them slowly try to solve these questions. The writers did a great job of creating this quasi-futuristic world and the conflicts it faces. Again, it's hard to talk about without spoiling.

While watching this I got two vibes from it. Cube and Reservoir Dogs. Two very different movies. 

I seriously recommend checking this out. Especially if you love a great mystery. It's on Netflix instant.     




 A few days ago I watched [The Iceman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1491044/?ref_=nv_sr_1) in which Michael Shannon plays notorious mob hitman Richard Kuklinski.

I thought the movie was very interesting. I had never heard about Kuklinski before I saw the movie so it was all new information for me which made it that much better because I didn't know a thing. The writing was pretty good as well as the directing, but what really stands out is the acting. Michael Shannon, as always, is extremely powerful in this role. He is seriously one of the best actors working today. Shannon is joined by Winona Ryder, Chris Evans, Ray Liotta, and a surprising David Schwimmer. Everyone in the cast does a great job. The stand outs were obviously Shannon and Chris Evans, or at least for me they were. It was nice to see Schwimmer in a *very* different role than normal. However, I kind of chuckled at Ray Liotta. Not because he was bad, Liotta is solid in this. I chuckled because Ray Liotta has to be one of the most typecasted actors today. I'm sure 90 percent of his career is gangster/mob stuff. Not that I'm complaining.

It's easy to overestimate an actors performance, but this movie is great because of Shannon. Without him I think it would have been just good. 

I got a Zodiac vibe from it. Mostly because they are both period piece crime films that take place over a decade. Which brings me to the other thing that stood out to me. The costume and set design. I totally felt that I was there in the 60s and 70s.

All in all I strongly recommend checking this out if you haven't. It's seriously a great film that really shows how powerful Michael Shannon is on screen. His presence is almost God-like in its power. It's on Netflix instant so give it a watch sometime.  




 Why what were you going to say? Please continue to contribute! 




 This is actually *exactly* what made me think of the quote from the movie I'm looking for. When I saw that ad I turned to my cousin and said, "It's just like in that movie when the kid is told to run home and runs to his actual home saying run home, run home." 




 Yes! This is it! For the past few days I've been saying this quote to myself trying to figure out where I heard it and whenever I typed it into google, all I got were home run videos. Thank you so much I can sleep now! 




 So yeah there was this baseball movie where a kid is told to run home so he runs to his house saying "run home run home" 




 Dude again I never said it was a bad post or it should be removed. I like it! No, image macros suck. Mods already said that those are pushing it. It may be half gaming related but that means it's 50% irrelevant as well. My first comment was downvoted because I made an observation. Then my second comment was downvoted because I was simply saying that I did like the post but just thought it'd be better suited somewhere else. I'm not being disrespectful to anyone.  




 I know we're pretty lenient with the rules around here but I'm sure this interferes with rule 1 somehow. I'm not saying this post sucks or it should be removed. I think it's hilarious! But I think it's better suited somewhere else like /r/Funny. It *barely* has anything to do with gaming besides the background and coloring.  




 The comments here suck 




 But don't people only do dangerous stuff for the adrenaline rush and to look cool? Like skydiving or free climbing? 




 I thought that the PS2 one was based on the movie Narc 




 Kind of related question, does anyone know the release date for the second episode of The Walking Dead Season 2? 




 Wow. A post about a movie character made it on the front page of /r/Gaming.  




 Mim looking for movies that are like Children of Men or The Road. Like movies where a character or group of characters have to travel through and survive either a war torn country or post apocalyptic world. Like where it's more about a journey the character(s) have to make through that world in order to get to a destination. 

Can you think of any movies like this? 




 I always thought Bradley Cooper would be a great choice.  




 [Smokin' Aces (2006)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475394/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

When a Las Vegas  performer decides to testify against the mob, they put a hit on him that brings together all sorts of crazy characters and assassins. This is a very fun action/thriller. 




 It's not the best, but I really *really* love the opening scene of [Narc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xfrmlcIQf4) 




 But I feel like this one is going for a comic book feel way more than Spiderman 3. So I think this one can get away with it.  




 This was my huge beef with GTA V. I fell about 50 feet and only lost about half health. I did a front flip down some stairs and died instantly. 




 Like for example, the hero is driving a car and the bad guy shoots at him and we, the viewer, see bullet holes and shattered glass. Do they put charges in the glass, or what?

I know when they do squibs, or blood hits, the actor wears an explosive blood pack. And wall hits are just pockets in the wall with tiny explosives. But how do they do glass? 




 And that you have to be an experienced professional and not just some dude. Thought I could just apply to be a gaffer but it looks like their looking for bigger pros.  




 Yeah it have a lot of respect for Heder. It must be so hard to be an actor and Mormon. Having to turn down roles. I respect that he sticks to his morals. There are quite a few famous actors who use to be Mormon but stopped practicing in favor of roles.  




 Not really any movie in particular, but I love on set b-role footage. I also really love special feature that look at how a movie's special effects were done. And I prefer these extras to be lengthy and not just a short 5 minute montage or compilation. Like the in depth on set footage or SFX stuff.

Spider Man 2 had literally hours of behind the scenes stuff.  




 I'm don't read comics but I had it spoiled for me when I looked at its IMDB. 




 I don't mind Bruno Mars and I think he's talented, but man I was so bummed when I realized it was Bruno with special guest Red Hot Chili Peppers and not the other way around. 




 Wait, so Bruno Mars is the star and The Red Hot Chili Peppers are the special guest?! Screw that 




 Can I get a gif of the "jazz hands" from the two dudes from the Seahawks and Broncos? Anyone know what I'm talking about? 




 Eli looked like Scar up in the box watching his brother Mufasa. 




 This is sad. It's a cold reminder that actors are still just people and they won't be around forever. It's always a weird feeling when you realize that you won't see someone again. It's always shocking and never easy to believe when someone dies. He was easily one of the greatest actors. He won't be forgotten. 




 Spy films. We really only see James Bond and we only get that like once every five years or more. 

Also noir. Like good classic style noir. Nicolas Winding refn is bringing it back in a way, but there is still a lack of it.

Lastly, hard, cerebral sci-fi. Today so many sci-fi movies are all about cgi, huge explosions, and lots of action. We don't really see sci-fi that focuses more on world building and story. Her was a great step towards getting back to hard sci-fi, but we need more of it. 




 I really liked how classic rock was used in a Knight's Tale. It contrasted with the times, yet it worked so well.

Another recent use I really loved was the use of The National's song About Today at the end of Warrior. I won't go into too much detail because I don't want to spoil this fantastic movie. But it perfectly captured that moment and broken relationship between two brothers and their father. 




 But that's sort of what I'm getting at. Movies *are* a visual media but I don't think that should mean visuals should come first. I'm not saying that Gravity's visuals come first, but it sure appears that way when the visuals drown out the story. Story is important. Especially if we're talking Best Picture. It's perfectly okay for a story to be simple. But there's a difference between simple and shallow. Children of Men wasn't even nominated in any acting categories, best picture or director. I may be in the minority here, but I believe Children of Men is a league above Gravity. Best picture should be a well rounded film, which I honestly don't think Gravity is. But again that said, I still think Gravity is a technological achievement in film.  




 [The Thin Red Line](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120863/?ref_=nv_sr_3) (1998), Terrence Malick 




 I never criticized Gravity's story. I never said it was bad, I just simply said it was similar to Avatar and American Hustle in that the story wasn't the best part.  The thing about Gravity is that it's okay to have a simple story. But it felt like the story wasn't important. You could tell that the tech was more important. When you have complex and bombastic tech and visuals, it overshadows the simple story. The story wasn't just simple, it was kind of flat. A story can be simple, but I feel it needs depth. Great stories are not determined by how complex or simple they are, but how much depth they have.  




 So when I was looking at the awards poster for Gravity that was posted on here I started thinking. I found Gravity to be one of the most technically impressive movies I've ever seen and it is an accomplishment. But I can't help but feel that it's a little over-hyped.

I find myself reminded of Avatar. Avatar is a technically impressive film of the same caliber as Gravity, I feel. Yet Avatar's plot was "meh". I feel the same about Gravity. Again, it's a technically remarkable film, but I feel that that's really all it has going for it. The acting is good and the plot is also kind of "meh".

Today, Avatar is a movie we don't think about to often, and while impressive on a big screen, it loses a lot of that impressiveness on a small, home tv. Going back to the awards poster for Gravity, one of the quotes says, "A groundbreaking film that must be seen in Imax 3D." Which is exactly like Avater. I worry that Gravity will not be as impressive on smaller screens resulting in a less powerful film because Gravity does rely a lot on its technical aspects.

I'm also reminded of American Hustle in a way. The general consensus here is that American Hustle has great acting but a "meh" plot, and a film shouldn't be considered great based on just one aspect of it. I think the same could be said for Gravity. The strongest, and really the only thing it has going for it, is its technical achievements. Now, I do realize that Gravity and American Hustle are two different beasts. And I do want to say that I'm not hating on Gravity because I think it's a really good film that has made incredible leaps in its technology. These are just observations I've made.

Edit: Just wanted to point out that Children of Men wasn't even nominated for any acting categories, best picture or director.  




 I have to say Napoleon Dynamite. I think it's so different from any other comedy. I love it's weird dry sense of humor. It's easily one of the movies I quote the most.

 Because /r/gaming is one of the worst subreddits.  




 I'm Mormon and I'm late to reply, but I can decide that it's just a game. I play M rated games and watch R rated movies all the time, even though we're encouraged not to. The way I see it, it's not influencing me. I'm able to separate my life from a video game or movie. In the case of GTA V, my character murders, breaks the law, drinks, goes to the strip club, etc. This is all happening in the game, sure I'm making him do it, but it's just a game. I'm not doing these things in real life so why should it matter. Same with R rated movies. I'm just a spectator, not a participant. 




 Dude...Kill List is in no way a comedy. Probably one of the darkest movies I've seen. I didn't feel good afterwords. Loved it though.  




 /r/movieclub does this every week. The community chooses based on upvotes then they watch and discuss. I'm not against having it here, but just FYI incase there are people who want to do this but we end up not doing it here.
