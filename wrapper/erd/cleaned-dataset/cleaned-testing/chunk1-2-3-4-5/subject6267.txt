 It's so important, since using an AHA (a weak, non AB one, but a gycolic acid nonetheless), I have had so many new freckles along my cheekbones despite only skipping sunscreen on somedays when I go out for just 30 mins

Ideally, you should be wearing sunscreen everytime you step outdoors to protect your skin 




 I have been considering buying the Mizon Snail Ampoule and Recovery Cream to improve my acne scarring. I have very pink scars on my forehead and hyperpigmentation that I'd like to improve and so wanted to ask if anyone has seen improvements after using snail products?  

Also, any other snail products would be greatly welcomed, its just the Mizon ones are available in the UK (where I'm based) 




 Ahh thank you!!! I didn't think to look in other subreddits *shakes head* 




 Has anyone in the UK bought things from RoseRoseShop or any other Korean websites and avoided customs?  I really want to buy a few products to get a full routine going but I hate dealing with Customs, VAT and processing fees upon arrival. 




 There are a few Sasa stores dotted around the city that stock some Missha from what I remember, they also have loads of sheet masks.  There is also a 'drugstore' called Watsons that sell sheet masks as well as generic stuff i.e. Maybelline etc. but I only go their for their own sheet masks. When I go to Beijing, I normally buy packs of sheet masks e.g. My beauty diary and they're about 40-50, which is about GP 5-6 so that works out to be super cheap for me. Watson's also have their own brand of sheet masks that I quite like, especially the Birds Nest ones. Watson's often give free samples at the check out too!!


If you're going to be around the Sanlitun area both Watson's and Sasa are in the area. 

If you have anything else to ask about Beijing, please do, I was born there, raised in London and spend at least a month there every year. 




 How does the Skinfood salmon concealer work for you? I have the worst dark circles anyone has ever seen...  
Have fun in Barca!!! 




 Thank you thank you!! Should I just use the BHA or AHA just in the evenings? I think if I used it twice a day, it would be a bit too much. I'll probably go with the Mizon snail repair cream, it seems to be quite popular, thank you again!!! 




 Thank you thank you!! I'll definitely step up the oil cleansing to a bit of Castor oil. Thanks again!!! 




 Could anyone help me with starting a routine please? I've been reading around this subreddit for a while now and still feel unsure about what to use. 

I just turned 18 and have combo skin- T-zone gets oily overnight (not so much during the day) but the rest of my face is pretty normal.   I do tend to get acne on my forehead and recently, get painful pimples toward my hairline.  I also tend to have a lot of blocked pores on my forehead and this can sometimes lead to squeezing *sorry sorry, it's awful I know* so I'd love to use something to target the blocked pores and blackheads around my nose and also to lift some freckles along my cheekbone.


**AM**:   

I don't wash my face with a cleanser in the morning, just cold water, and since doing this, have seen a positive improvement in frequency of blemishes.

- Mario Badescu Special Cucumber lotion (rec by a online sales staff but have seen no difference)  
- Mario Badescu Glycolic toner -nice but doesn't do a terrible lot  
- Instanaturals Vitamin C serum  
- Kiehls Dark Spot corrector: have not seen any difference  
- Kiehls Oil-free daily moisturiser  
- Lancme SPF: would like to change to an Asian suncreen maybe the Biore aqua, this pills when I rub my face, especially when I';m exercising.  


**PM**


Nothing really changes except I use the Neutrogena Pink Grapefruit Cleanser and Coconut oil to oil pull and:  

- Rosehip oil to massage the acne scars  
- 3x week I use a facemask, varying from Origins's clay mask, Origin's hydrating mask, and the many sheet masks I bring back from China  


All in all, I'd really appreciate it if you guys could recommend some AHA and BHA toners to clean the pores and make my skin glow and some brightening products e.g. serums or essences to lift some of my freckles and acne scarring, and maybe a cheap essence to use with the DIY sheetmasks that brightens and/or hydrates.  


I currently live in the UK but have family in China who can send some products over too and I will be going to Seoul in October, so any UK sellers not listed on the list in the sidebar would also be lovely!!!


Thank you!!!! 




 Pearl Cream- its a very rich moisturiser that has been around for decades. Has a slight scent but in winter, I apply it to any dry patches and massage with rosehip oil and they're gone. 














 I found this article on on how Swedish fathers were able to spend more time with their children due to Sweden's generous parental leave. My favourite photograph is the one of the father painting his daughter's nails whilst holding his other baby 









 I hope someone goes and buys all of these in one go... 




 Diner scene in Reservoir Dogs, a big group of breakfast food (my favourite type) 









 What do you do during long times of solitude, or if you're waiting e.g. when waiting for transport, or walking long distances by yourself? Do you find listening to music etc . soothing during these normally mundane times? 




 Update: Success!! Went on a few, first few, the T bar ended up being flung whilst getting off but then it was all good. Except when there were gale force gusts and my leg cramped up trying to stay on. 




 I did wonder how else you'd stay on by yourself, I suppose this way makes it easier for me to jolt myself off as well... 




 If I am unfortunate enough, I shall follow in your ways and perhaps even point out someone else 




 I'm going skiing on Tuesday but just found out that the runs I will be going on will mostly be T-bar lists. Just wondering if anyone has any advice for loading and unloading? I can work a Poma fine, is it similar except just slide the bar behind you instead of straddling it? 
























 Sure, I live in London, in the UK :) 

Oh really? I do find that most AB redditors say that they normally wait around 14 days for shipping. It may be Canadian customs that are holding onto it. Did you pay for the 'K-packet' shipping? 




 I honestly didn't expect them to arrive for another 5 days at least and I'm already preparing my next wish list! I was in such a rush in getting the door one of my contacts actually popped out from rubbing my eye...(these exams, seriously)

I'll definitely let you know how I get on with them, the peeling gel is actually for my dad so we'll see how well it works for both of us (he is 50 with wrinkles and I'm 18 with hyperpigmentation). 




 I paid for the items on 18/05 and they both were shipped on 20/05 and arrived today (27/05).

I now finally know why people post their hauls, waiting 7 days for shipping feels like a year compared to domestic services! 









 Ahh!! I've never hit up their standalone stores before, I'll be sure to check them out when I'm back in town. Oh I know the Viva mall, its right opposite station!

Thanks so much, so excited to go!! 




 You don't believe me? 




 Beijing isn't so bad most of the time, although older buildings (anything but apartment complexes) always have a few lurking mozzies in my experience.
  Buy yourself an electric mosquito swatter, those things are great to wave around the place to kill any.
  Buy yoself a tonne of Tiger Balm once you arrive, they're sold at any pharmacy. Try to buy the 'Dragon and Tiger' brand and use this to rub onto any new mosquito bites. Slap that stuff on.
  I would recommend a plug in over the burner spiral type, you can find Raid ones in supermarkets always have the burner and the packs together for like 15 RMB.

DEET has been the best thing in my experience, when I stay my Grandma's place (her building was built in the 40s so its packed with mosquitoes), DEET is the only think that can protect me. Try to limit where you spray it, i.e. only on arms and legs and exposed skin. 




 That's usually the reason a Chinese gets with a non-Chinese guy. Places in Beijing like Sanlitun are now filled to the brim with girls stumbling in their heels to draw the attention of foreign guys. 




 Marriage is like some game in China right now. Elders in the family feel like after 35, the woman is a leftover. 

Seeing as there are more men to women, is it not wise to use a 'skill' of sorts to get to your ideal man and show off to their families, friends, coworkers etc.? I'm sure a lot of Chinese women have sex regularly, and have sex before marriage, but like a lot of countries in Asia, seeming 'pure' and virginal is a large attraction.

I don't think Chinese girls and women are asexual but most girls probably still associate sex as something difficult to bring up, especially with family, and school whilst there are women who also enjoy regular or casual sex. 




 Can I ask which stores in Beijing you went to? I've been to the Sasa's and Watson's around but I'm running out of other places to go to. Out of the stores I've been to, I don't think I've seen much of the Korean brands around :( 




 The MG masks are really nice and also go for around the 20 RMB mark, which is around 2 or $3.25 mark (rough guess). I've also tried Watson's own Bird's Nest sheet mask that I really like, it left my skin feeling very hydrated after the drying Beijing air (its so dry I get nosebleeds).

Most Chinese women I know use Korean brands as there are plenty of poor quality ingredients that Chinese manufacturers use, so there aren't too many high quality Chinese beauty products I'm afraid.

Shenzhen stores will probably carry lots of imported goods that you may find are cheaper and also, sometimes if you buy products as samples, they come out waaayyyyy cheaper. My aunt buys like 10 of Lancme's Toner in 30 mls and it works out to be far cheaper than the 200 ml bottle. 




 This varies from region to region, in Beijing, we have it for breakfast and its a lot thicker, consisting of tofu, mu er and huang hua and has a deep, almost smoky taste to it 




 Yeah I agree, I have also had issues with EMS abroad too, which sucks. I'm pretty sure Jolse and RRS state that they mark down the value. 




 I'm really worried about my order too, even though I didn't pay for EMS. I ordered around $90 worth plus $16 shipping on RRS so I really hope Customs won't believe that its a 'gift' and crack it open, even though I've heard RRS lowers the value of the items. It's my first AB haul too so here's hoping... 




 Hi, congrats on making the move!

I can help on a few things here for you:

2) Try to buy non-import goods from supermarkets (the prices are crazy) and try stick to local markets. Local communities tend to go to a few local shops or stalls, particularly the elders. My local shop has very fresh eggs and seasonal produce, particularly watermelon. Ensure to wash all food before consumption though and peel foods when you can, e.g. apples etc. due to the sheer amount of pesticides, fertilisers etc. 

With regards to milk, I don't know if you've heard of the many milk scandals, but my parents have told me to stick to San Yuan . As far as I know, they're the only ones without any big issues so far, but to be honest, all milk tastes bizarre to me in China so I tend to just drink Soy.

If you are around the Wang Jing area, there are many Koreans there so maybe you will get a chance to enjoy some local Korean food too.

AVOID SUPERMARKETS ON WEEKENDS ESPECIALLY SATURDAY MORNING -thats the biggest piece of advice I can give you with regards to shopping. Supermarkets often have fresh stock on Saturday and so cut prices or have deals on Saturday morning. Trust me, the price cuts are not worth the pushing, shoving, yelling, and dirty looks you will receive. Try to shop local at smaller markets (better for the economy too) for the easiest.

3) I agree with [heavy_petting], try to shop at large supermarkets for better deals, Walmart, Carrefour etc. are great for household items. I often go to Tian Yi in XiChengQu (its a large market with loads of stuff and sellers, so you can haggle for various goods from paper card to fly swatters to jewellery. I would advise against buying electricals there though, they're probably fake or will break very quickly)

4) Try to barter or haggle whenever you can, not in actual shops obviously but at places like street foods or vendors in large markets. If street food is already cheap for you or you feel generous, go ahead but for reference I normally pay ~4 for a jian bing (go try these, I crave them all the time) and if you are heading the Wang Fu Jing Xiao Chi Jie don't hesitate to haggle for a skewer. I remember when I was 16, there was an American in front of me paying 15 for a fruit skewer and I paid 4. As a British man, I assure you people will try to rip you off so don't be shy to haggle.

Also, don't be afraid to try new foods, things like chickens feet, pif trotters are delicious and have benefits for the body. Don't let the fear of food poisoning stop you from eating new foods.


As a fellow Brit, I also must plead with you not to be annoyed when people don't queue or apologise when pushing you out of the way. Don't be surprised when people race to get a seat on the subway and just stand there enjoying the air con, reminiscing the days spent on the hot stuffy Tube.

Try to dress appropriately, the weather changes a lot in August, it will be sickeningly hot and humid in August until around the 22nd then get cooler then BAM its suddenly autumn with the breeze.

Thats all I can think of for now, its time to go back to A Level revision. If you have any other things you want to ask, feel free to. 




 The weather in Beijing is hot, how hot? How humid, how much heat does the smog add?

Its hot in summer, the hot days are about to begin and will only relent at the end of August. Some days are crazy dry and some days will be disgustingly humid- beware, if you are going to the South, especially Nanjing, or places in Sichuan, you may feel like you're suffocating. Beijing gets temperamental through June to August so one day may be really dry and hot and the next can be humid and stifling.

The dry days are coming soon and can really dry your body so you may need a humidifier, I can often get nosebleeds the air is so dry. 

Please, please, please remember to wear sunscreen, preferably a sweat proof one, if you will be walking and doing 'touristy things' under the sun without sunscreen, your skin will hate you. For extra UV protection, be very Chinese and buy a UV parasol once you're there.

Any types of clothing that I should specifically not bring? Any colors that are looked down upon or just not worn?

Not really, don't wear anything crude or discriminatory and I would suggest light fabrics e.g. linen, viscose (wears a dream and will feel lush on humid days). You will be more amazed by what other Chinese people wear, I know I am fascinated by the sheer amount of incorrect grammar on most people's tshirts and items.

Enjoy your time!! 




 Go to a pharm at night and ask. I went in the morning and refused, telling me to come back at night, so I went back burning a 40 degree celcius fever and popped a few Amoxicillins they sold me.

Night time = shady time. 




 I'm Chinese and was born In Beijing but raised in London so here are some places my family and friends go to, usually for ~5-10 people, with a small summary of what I remember:


**Food**

- Cats eye pizza (various locations) -Supposedly opened by a guy who used to work at Pizza Hut then opened his own place.... But decent enough western food and very cheap, pizza is about 25-40 depending on toppings. I love their desserts and always order plenty to share.

- Gong de lin  (Qian men, Dongcheng) VEG

Personally not for me but the vegetarians in my family love it, lots of mushroom (bai ling gu ) dishes made into meat like dishes. Its usually really cramped there though but they have some signature Buddist dishes.

- Jin Si Shu Shi Fang  (Xizhimenwai, Haidian) VEG

LOVE THIS PLACE, its a tad expensive for just vegetarian dishes but they also cater for vegans. They make a really good sausage out of  as well, as well as a 'jiao liu rou pian ' out of the mushrooms too. Sadly their Dongsi branch has closed due to government demolition (perils of being in Beijing) but the Dong Zhi Men branch is just as good. I would definitely buy dinner there, vegetarians or otherwise.


- Quan ju de  various locations, Qian Men is OG)

Not Beijing if you ain't eaten their duck. 'Nuff said.

- Song he lou   (Nanlishimen, Xicheng= my ends or Zhizhuyuan, Haidian)

Excellent  song shu gui y, definitely something to photograph. Veers on expensive side but one of Ba Da Lou, so basically, a must. Very enjoyable Huai yang cai, try their meatball soup, extremely tender pork and 'melts in the mouth' as some may say. They also do a lovely Shui Jian Bao, very crispy and mince inside is well seasoned.

-  Dong Xing Lou (Tongxian, Tongzhou)

Another nice place to eat, they have quite a few sea cucumber dishes that are nice, but its a bit of a trek seeing as it's in Tongxian

-  Tong Ren Ju (Haidian) 

Open space with large upper floor. If you go, appreciate the high ceilings and the balconied corridor of the first floor rarely seen in Beijing restaurants. I had the best spring onion pancakes *of my life* (they are 'pull apart-esque'), a huge statement as I eat spring onion pancakes almost daily.

- Sizzler (various locations)

For when you're just craving a steak, took an American friend I met in Sanlitun (surprise surprise) who was craving TGI Friday's. Very basic, but good western style buffet salad bar.

STREET FOOD IN GENERAL 3

**Drinks**

Honestly, Sanlitun is for foreigners (no offense, but really, c'mon) and I have been to a fair few bars there few underage, so I really can't say I have enjoyed many bars in Sanlitun. 

Seeing as booze is so cheap in Beijing, why not just buy a bottle and stay home? If you want to go out and drink though, I think just ordering drinks with food or best of all, with small eats and KTV!!

I would recommend to stay away from the Western food though, theres nothing better than Xiao Chi in China (trust me, I used to go eat Western food a lot in Bejing and you just feel like you've missed out on a chance to try great food, especially as the Western foods aren't as authentic as the original)

Apologies for the mix of Pin Yin and Han Zi, I have being studying the whole day for the next 3 weeks of A Level exams but I really wanted to recommend some places.

Enjoy eating!! 




 Sanlitun is known for being 'foreign', full of Euro and American style bars, its fun for meeting foreigners but I wouldn't call it a Chinese experience, especially when a drink can cost the same as a food dish!

But still, define what you like as 'fun' and maybe its for you! 




 I agree with doing what makes you feel good too. However, just to let you know you may find that if you're living in a small town (Changping even has some villages) you may receive 'funny looks' when going out just because people aren't used to seeing such behaviour. Even still, if it were me, I would just do whatever hair I liked.

With regards to how people perceive you though, don't get offended if people point out you're foreign or look more foreign: I'm fully Chinese, born and originate from Beijing and I get asked by strangers if I'm mixed race due to my darker skin (compared to other, paler girls in Beijing) and lack of accent. 

Last year, I decided to get my hair digitally permed in Beijing during my summer there and it was far cheaper than in London, so if you're looking for a perm or professional dyeing, I suggest you do it in China (I'm assuming your Mandarin is good enough to communicate well with your hairstylist) and like always, bring photos to show your them what you want.   




 I have read up a lot on Vit-C as a brightener and currently have about 3/4 of a bottle of Instanatural's Vitamin C serum, which has 20% Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (the second ingredient right after deionised water).

I know that the L-AA Vit-C's must be used before any other actives, directly after cleansing, but seeing as I'm not using a L-AA, do I still need to use it before my acids? 

I've also made my first purchase from RRS today so hopefully I can get a proper routine going soon! 




 I use Piz Buin All day SPF 30, it has a pleasant scent to it, dries well and is great from sunny days to skiing, although I'm a fan of the Hawaiian Tropics Silk too 
























 Seriously the best food when going for a day out, especially for things like hiking or travelling (not flying obvs) 




 I just find it easier to massage around with one hand towards my fingertips, as I'm usually using my computer with my more dominant hand haha. I suppose I could just pump it onto my left hand but I really lack control.

Will the balm work well as part of OCM? I really enjoy the steaming part 




 I thought making us remove our water bottle labels was going too far. 




 This shoot deserves to be in Vogue. 




 Seconding this; bar street can be fun but its become pretty pricey (so is all of Sanlitun to be fair) and a bit repetitive. The clubs and bars around Gongti Ximen are definitely the place to go for meeting expats. 

If you're thinking of drinking something different or are into beers, Heaven supermarket is a nice place to head to, its not very expensive and has a variety of drinks in a supermarket style but with a seating area to meet people. Personally, I prefer going there over the clubs.

If you're looking to meet foreign students (inc. girls) in Beijing, head on over to Wudaokou, its good fun, local pubs have things like Quiz nights going on too.

I do really recommend going to some night markets, the Wangfujing Snack Street at night is pretty good for tourists but be sure to haggle. Also, eat lots of street food (if your stomach can handle it), jianbing is definitely one to pick up. 




 I'm currently using TFS's Rice Water Bright cleansing oil as the first step in my evening routine but i find it to be too 'slippery', its a little too runny and I have to tilt my face back a little to make sure it doesn't run down into my eyes (I pumped it straight onto my face and begin massaging.... I know, its odd but I really need to maximise my study time). I do love the smell of this one though 3

Could anyone recommend a different oil with a bit more grip? I have blocked pores on my forehead and normal/combo skin. I also don't wear very much makeup but use the Biore UV gel sunscreen. 




 I really like the palette, maybe I'll get one after finishing up mu current finishing powder. I'm looking to buy my first cushion compact, will definitely keep the AmorePacific in mind!! 




 So jealous of your glow right now!! By the way, is it the Ambient Lighting palette your using? I'm thinking of getting one as people say that it gives you this radiance, but its sooooo pricey. 




 I actually got a sample of the Fresh Cherry tint in my Jolse delivery the other day! I'll definitely give it a go. Can you apply lip balm on top of it? 




 I have used the Mario Badescu drying lotion which is basically calamine solution at the bottom with alcohol at the top. I used to apply this, let it dry then wash off and repeat and this has created such bad scarring, as the alcohol completely dried my skin out leaving me with a thin scab. Once the scab came off, the skin underneath was very pale pink, a sign of tissue damage.

I received the Mizon Acence Blemish Out Pink Spot the other day and and it seems to be pretty much the same but it has castor oil as to not dry the skin out as much. I would recommend this over any other spot treatments.

However, if you need a transparent one, the Origins Spot Zapper works well too. 




 I'm pretty sure the BHA A-sol is meant to be spot treatment but most people use it as a toner, seeing as the BHA content is not strong enough to just use as a BHA.

If you use a higher pH cleanser, something like 6, maybe the AHA/BHA toner would be better as it would bring the pH right down to balance the skin? 




 I'm looking for a lip tint/stain, preferably something similar in texture to YSL's Glossy Stain and having the longevity of Sephora's Cream Lip Stain but I don't mid if its more matte. The only thing is, my lips dry out quite easily so I'm worried watery tints will seep into the dry spots.

If you guys could recommend any lip products, especially any red ones, that last long (through eating etc.) I'd really appreciate it! 




 I have double eyelids but they're uneven, one sort of folds at a different angle, so for the past 2 years I have been wearing eyelid tape during the night (so that when my face swells in the morning, it helps to take shape) and the days when I'm at home all day (weekends and the days I finish school early). This has been a very long process and I have seen some improvement, but I expect it will still need longer.

My cousin, who has monolids, has managed to create a permanent double fold over the years, by using tape to 'teach' her lids to fold that way. However, she still often goes out with the tape on, although so do many other girls in China.

Eyelid tape does and probably will do some damage to the elasticity of the skin, so remember to be gentle and try to reduce any tugging etc.

My dad also has blepharitis, and he finds that using salt water for a hot compress really helps when his eyes get itchy and red. 




 They're fake but they do the job, my mum went there when she misplaced her reading glasses and she got a pair of 'Cartier' glasses within 2 hours using her glasses as a reference for a script. She did say they ended up being a lot stronger though... 




 Hey! Welcome to the world of AB!! I'm pretty new to it myself but its been a really good learning process so far.

What's your skin type like? From what's in your cart, I'm assuming you have some PIH and maybe acne?

If it's those, I think your products will do a good job, I pretty much bought the same but I have the CosRX BHA returning A-Sol to use as a toner after cleansing as I've read that the AHA/BHA toner from CosRX has a really low pH of 3.85, which [u/SnowWhiteandthePear](http://www.reddit.com/user/SnowWhiteandthePear) blogged about [here](http://snowwhiteandthepear.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/review-cosrx-aha-bha-clarifying.html).

Make sure to introduce the BHA and AHA's into your routine slowly, e.g. starting with just once a week, then slowing increasing or decreasing depending on how your skin responds. An overhaul of acids can often lead to purging.

To tackle blackheads and acne, I would start with BHA and the Vit C first (do remember the OST is an L-AA, so your order should be Vit C, wait 20 mins, BHA, wait, then AHA if using all three). The snail is also great as a light moisturiser, use it according to the light to heavy theory of viscocity.

I like to use the Mizon Snail Recovery Gel as a final moisturiser as I like the texture it leaves on my skin, its not too suffocating before going to sleep. 














 Yeah, the BHA sample is from them, I'm not quite sure when I'll be able to use it though.. it seems like such a small amount.

I tried everything last night except the AHA, but I'm going to put them through more use to get a better feel though. I found the CosRX Snail Mucin so weird though, I put one pump onto my palm and used my fingers to spread out on my face and it just had the biggest trail. The texture is a little odd at first but it did moisturise quite nicely overnight. 




 The waiting is the hardest part! The first 2 days I was obsessively tracking where the orders were but eventually I just gave up cause after I saw it had arrived in Europe, there weren't any other updates.

Excited for you to get your products though!! 




 You know, I honestly didn't feel too different after using this, probably because I usually oil cleanse with grapeseed oil and coconut oil (although I've stopped using this for facial cleansing now). I found the Rice Cleanser hard to lather up too, even though I used like 3 pumps, did you have any problems with emulsifying? 




 I'm a little hesitant due to the things I've heard about purging, I know you're meant to take it slow (giggledegoo) but I just want to rush in and see what clean pores look like! 




 Everything haha! I'm really excited/nervous to give the process chemical exfoliation a proper go, I've used Mario Badescu's Glycolic Acid toner before but it didn't do anything for me in terms of lifting my PIH, although it did give me a slight glow. 

I've never used BHA's before so I'm hoping it'll do a good job cleaning out my pores, particularly on my forehead where I normally get breakouts. 


































 VPN- I use Onavo Protect which is pretty decent, I can use social media and YouTube fairly well on it. I think its free in the Apple App Store 




 Really? I found that it disappeared so fast, maybe it would be better on top of a cream highlighter like the Topshop Glow... 









 Do you have Sleek's contour kit? They are amazing, so easy to use and there is more contour powder than highlighter (is it just me who runs out of contour first?). This can be hard to track down but they're definitely in the Marble Arch Superdrug or Oxford Circus Boots.

MUA matte lipsticks are very good for the extremely cheap price, they last fairly well for a matte but can be quite drying but less than MAC's Ruby Woo.

I really recommend popping into a TK Maxx if you happen to pass one, they often have great stuff, not necessarily exclusive to the UK but they're really cheap. They often have stuff from Nails Inc, OPI, Japonesque, Ecotools and loads of skincare bits too. 




 I saw this in store the other day, the pastel colours look amazing! 




 Has anyone else tried this highlighter? I finally managed to hunt it down in Superdrug the other day, swatched it on my inner wrist and proceeded to wander around the store. About 5 mins later, I looked at my wrist and the intense shimmer had faded to the subtlety of the Hourglass Ambience Lighting powders! 

I have seen blogs saying its comparable to the Mary-Loumanizer but I was so disappointed when I tried this one out, it looked so incredible in the pan :( 




 Hear hear! Except I'm here like every 2 hours now that summer has started... 




 I agree, I put on my CosRX BHA A-Sol, BHA Blackhead Power and Mizon AHA and the acids huuuurrrrrttttt. Its a stinging akin to the sing you get from a spot treatment.  




 Have you tried the UD primer potion, if you have, would you recommend this over it? It looks great, but I'm trying to decide if the shipping hassle is worth it, haha 




 No worries, thank you anyway! I'm a #23 in Mishha's Perfect cover so this one is probably a little too light for me :(

I have heard that Innisfree's shades runs slightly lighter than other cushions though, which is quite odd 




 Can I ask what skin tone you are e.g. foundation or MAC no. and which shade of the Innisfree cushion you got? I really want to get a cushion but am unsure of which to get, this water glow one looks amazing though! 




 Ohhhh I'm really interested in that one! Is it similar in texture to the Missha at all? 




 So since I have finally finished my last A-Level exam today, I thought it would be good time to start reviewing some products I bought last month. Today: a review on Missha's Super Aqua Detoxifying Peeling Gel. 

**What is it and how is it used?** A physical exfoliant that is applied onto a dry face and requires massaging/rubbing gently until the product 'pills', then rinse off.

**First impression?** I REALLY like the scent of this. If you like Lancme's Miracle perfume smells like, then YAAAAASS, this is amazing. Its a very light floral scent that dissipates as soon as you rinse it off.

The first time I tried it, I felt like it did absolutely nothing but then I realised you do have to use a fair bit; I used about a 4cm length of the product for just my forehead.

**Does it do what it says on the tin?** Yes..... but it won't get rid of any large flakes. If you have slightly dry skin that requires some physical exfoliation and you find the St. Ives apricot scrub too harsh, you may like this better. However, if you have any scabs or large flakes on your skin, this won't do very much for that and using a muslin cloth during cleansing may be more effective. This product doesn't clean out blackheads as well as the St. Ives one does, due to the smaller exfoliating beads.

**Anything else?** This also reminded of the Este Lauder Pore Refiner in terms of texture, its very fine and the granules are so small. You also have to stand in front of the sink for this product, the more you massage it in, the more it pills and the bits become larger until you rinse it off. (Imagine scrubbing your body to exfoliate all the dirt and grub off and bits of dead skin rolls forming *sorry* but on a much smaller scale) 

**Repurchase?** Yes, it works well in conjunction with my chemical exfoliants and does the job without being too harsh on my skin.

I hope you've found this useful, hopefully I can do another one of these on the Blackhead Melting Oil soon! 




 I only realised today that my mother will be coming home from a 3 month work trip from Beijing at the end of this month and I wanted to source some AB products for her to use to welcome her home.

She's in her mid 40's and has quite dehydrated skin that can do with some plumping and tone correction (she has freckles due to careless sun exposure) as well as some bags under her eyes. She currently uses stuff like Estee Lauder's Advanced Night Serum, Lancme's Genfique eye cream and moisturiser. When she gets home, I plan on getting her started in chemical exfoliation and maybe some yeast products?....

At home, we currently have:

* Mizon's AHA 8% serum
* CosRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid
* CosRX Snail 96 Mucin
* Mizon's Snail Recovery Gel
* SAP Vitamin C serum

If you guys can recommend some products to get her into, I'd really appreciate it and I'm sure she will too! Thank you in advance!

 I'm really curious about the EH BB cushion as I haven't heard too much about it, please do let us know how it goes! 




 Maybe try some vegan places to eat out? I know a place thats vegetarian/vegan that was started by Buddhists. Its not cheap but you can probably order some dishes, I remember a lot of their 'mock meat' food was made out of Bailinggu, a type of mushroom. 

Other than that, its probably wisest to eat at home. 




 YAAAAASSSS, so excited for this! 




 Also not AB but O'Keefe's Working Hands Cream (pretty sure its on Amazon, definitely is in the UK). 

This stuff will heal cracked hands, split fingertips and everything. If you don't mind some chemicals (its got paraffin) it really does a great job overnight and you can reapply during the day as its not sticky or oily at all. Its got a very light paraffin smell to it, but is completely unnoticeable unless you sniff your hands. 




 I seriously agree with you both and trust me I would, but the exams that determine whether or not I enter Medicine in university are tomorrow through to next Wednesday and the stress is getting to me.

I do take on board your advice though and will get on it once these exams are done! 




 Yeah I agree, although my friends and siblings (read cousins, since I am Chinese) all like to try Belgian beers there too.

I believe the team currently ahead in Lush's pub quiz are called 'The Boner Condoners' so I totally get what you mean. 
























 Yep, pretty much everything here is Japanese but with simplified Chinese eg. Kiss Me is written as  (pronounced tchi-shhhh-may) however the MG masks are Chinese and they work really nice for me, but that Neutrogena cleanser is super drying, as with a lot of Chinese cleansers (Pond's too OMG my face) probably due to the high pH. 




 Oh wow, the C20 seems worth a shot then, I may as well apply it like lotion 




 So due to RRS's revamp and subsequent sale, I'm thinking of purchasing either the OST C20 or the It's Skin Power 10 VC, although I am leaning towards the C20 cause I'm using a SAP from Instanaturals and don't seem to be seeing any results.

It does seem that most people find C20 to oxidise quite fast so perhaps maybe I could use it on my back to treat acne scarring?

Has anyone else tried using Vitamin C serums on their body and how were the results? 




 Its so much easier to use the search function as well, it took me ages to figure out how to use it before! 









 I am soon moving to study abroad for a while so I need to get rid of this stuff. I will add more things to this list as I pack over time so please do check it out!

 Sweet AND savoury pancakes!! 




 It seems that Innisfree's versions tends to run 1 shade lighter than everyone else for some reason and so it probably wouldn't match. 




 Hi, I'm in the UK and my flair thread is [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/mueflair/comments/3aoh31/test_subject6267_flair_thread/) 









 I was the one who posted, sorry! 




 I second the Mizon Acence Pink Out, it really sucks out all the nasty pus inside the spot but don't keep reapplying consecutively. I definitely prefer this to Mario Badescu's Spot Solution, which I found to be so drying- it literally left dark spots of damaged skin after. 




 Oh I absolutely love her character! She's pretty much the absolute epitome of asian parenting hahaha, especially when she butters up to Joon Mo and Ye Jin 




 Yeah of course, take your time! I'll PM you the total price and my details. 




 That's great, I'll PM you my PayPal details and will ship them Monday morning! 




 Yes, of course. Just to let you know, I have underestimated the shipping, 1st Class recorded is actually 4.40 and 2nd class is 3.90 as per Royal Mail's website:http://www.royalmail.com/sites/default/files/Royal-Mail-UK-and-international-parcel-and-letter-prices-30-March-2015.pdf

Is this okay for you? 




 Sure, just to confirm, are you in the UK?

 Oh my goodness, I have been waiting for this for ages! I'm sitting on another AB order and this is exactly what I need to make a final decision! 




 I've had some of Mario Badescu's stuff which an online SA recommended after I described my skin type. I have the Cucumber Cleansing Toner: it did absolutely nothing for me, I now use it on my back before applying my Benzoyl Peroxide just to use it up. The Glycolic toner is quite good, especially if you're new to AHA's as its fairly mild, although I'm not quite sure what concentration it is.

I would say Fig   Yarrow have a similar philosophy and products to Aesop; I've tried their coffee body scrub before which was nice, but I felt like I could make it myself with used coffee grounds.  




 Yeah I've heard that its a great dupe for the Hourglass Ambient Light Pallette 




 I haven't eaten red meat for the past 4-5 months but once I got here like 2 days ago, I have been chomping food down like mad.

The lamb was so crisp like lamb chua'er and so tender, well marinated and the soup was very light with a mix of silken and frozen tofu to give it more texture. Could definitely taste all spice, cumin and cinnamon in the lamb. I also spooned some of the stew with my rice to mix and it was really amazing.

Best part is, that dish cost like 40RMB, which is like 4!!
