 Reminds me off one of the opening scenes in Clockwork Orange 



















 KIILLL MEEEE 














 Hi, I'm the Holiday Armadillo! 
























 Imagine a reddit paint fight day. One in every major city around the world! 




 Agreed! That would be amazing! 









 GIF! Y U NO START? 




 Luminaeus, that made me laugh for a good five minutes. Thank you!! 




 StickDoctor, you have made my day. Thank you very much! I look forward to helping you when I can! 




 Haha! I was thinking [this!](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20101015151248/muppet/images/0/05/Beaker.jpg) 




 Much appreciated! :) 




 Oh, great Sega5! If you find any more of his work can you tag it here? 




 The album is called 'xTaken' by Benny Lam for the Society for Community Organisation. The photographs were commissioned to draw attention to the housing crisis engulfing the city. 



















 There's leftovers! Happy to share! :)

 Oh my god, absolutely lost it at 'peach out'. 




 Living right up to that username 




 "Oh, you said it, friend - but I wanted to stay 'cause I almost had sex on this girl. 
Oh yeah, but it was so expensive, each drink was like 6 dollars 40." 




 Nothing cringe here. They strive to ace the test and finish first and they did. We'll done for learning what you've been taught!

 This dog is not born that way. He spent major part of his growth years cramped inside a small cage and his body couldn't develop. Last year he was found roaming in the streets of France and the very good news is that he got adopted by a very animal loving family. 



















 Was getting to meet Kim Kadashian part of the gift, too? 




 That's the Little Creatures Brewery on Brunswick

 I was hoping for a billion, but $5 is more than I came in with so we have a deal. 





























 Is this Brisbane, OP? 




 All this proves is that John Candy faked his own death and spends his days playing bass and selling drugs. 




 Throw spiders at it 









 Yeah, pretty much every abbreviated plural.

Yankees think it's math
Yanks think it's math

Yankees/yanks 




 That was perfect.

 Nope, doesn't quite get his body around. He completes a full flip and still needs to get his feet out from under him to complete the second. 




 I just had to Google what WiFi actually stands for. How have I not questioned it before??

 Yep - moggill rd/rafting ground rd? 




 And just like that, Phil knew he'd never be the same. The friends he thought he had had violated his trust and preyed upon his trusting nature. The change in him happened as fast as an electrical pulse. At that moment, he was no longer Phil; he had become what the world now knows as Insanity Wolf! 




 Some say he's a mystery wrapped in an enigma 




 Nice to meet you, elevatormech :) 




 What did you call me? 




 No one except your Reddit family. Don't you DARE divorce us! 




 This is the first time I've noticed the text reflected in Morpheus' glasses...well done! 




 Straight out of Witcher 




 Ahh yes; Karaoke 




 R...Roger Federer?? 




 Holy balls that made me laugh 




 Cheeky boob squeeze :) 














 "Up fucked I" 




 Kinkerland. Hehe 




 She says thanks! It's an Asos dress :) 




 We have a professional set, this is just an iPhone pic :) but thanks you!!! 




 Thanks! It's Montville in Queensland :) 
























 Perfect! Thank you for your help!  




 That's a great idea, thanks! I'm so glad I asked, most of these things I have never heard of!  




 Oh, perfect - that's a big help! Thank you! 




 Thank you /u/lilypetal! I love your suggestion about natural sunlight, I will have to rearrange our room but I think I can work it. And I hadn't thought about the spills, either. I imagine that as nice as a wood finish would look it would be horrible for stains.   




 Hi ladies of /r/makeupaddiction! I need your help.

My fianc's birthday is coming up, and I thought the perfect gift would be to buy or put together a make up battlestation for her. I am willing to spend a lot of time on it, and my budget is not really capped.

In terms of advice, I'm really looking for ideas on what features you'd like in your own make up stations and how to go about sourcing the materials. Mirror styles and types, storage zones (make up and jewelery potentially?), shelving, new make up to buy her to include and the physical design of the entire thing. The area I have available is a space of about 2.5m x 1m. 

Pictures of your own dedicated make up areas would be appreciated as well as I really have no idea what I'm up against.

You are all amazing, THANK YOU!
 




 Am I the only one frustrated by the fact that the ball's initial track down the first ramp isn't smooth? 




 Ahh the ol' reddit switchararoo 




 No, I don't think he minds to much. He knows anything on Facebook is public domain. It was more of a hilarious shock I think! 




 He uploaded it to his Facebook, next minute he sees himself in this ad! He did message them, [here's what they replied](http://i.imgur.com/AANaL5E.png)

EDIT: Not even sorry.

 Fair call, thanks olineIcanbene1. I'll x-post. 




 Why is her thigh censored? 




 If he fires from that position he'll have a hell of a headache 




 .........write that down. 




 Well...that escalated quickly.

 I'm just surprised that this person has no tear ducts!

 Yeah I recognized the casino. I work in the city and I saw a protest go past at around midday, some wearing guy Fawkes masks. I heard it is uni students protesting cuts to the federal government's tertiary funding to fund the Gonski reforms. But I could be wrong. 
























  "I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed."

 Thank you! 




 Oh good one, that's definitely a possibility! Thanks /u/Kelfox! 




 Travel, leisure and corporate 




 I'm trying to figure out who they've approached to perform. 




 That would be amazing. 




 Good answer! I think they may be a bit over the top for a work conference though. 




 I was thinking Gaga...but she's performing somewhere else that night.  














 The mildest of mildly interesting 




 This isn't Tumblr, you don't need to yell 




 Interestingly, Mongolians call him Chinggis Khan. 'Genghis' is a poor Anglicization from back in the day. 




 Teehee! Thanks /u/Lestefania I thought it was a great find! 




 Great tips /u/thiscnidocyte. I think the focuses should be lighting and organization. Definitely a step up from beside the toothbrushes in the bathroom! 




 Thanks /u/wannabebaker101! I love the organizer idea, definitely a must! I've also bought a chair to go with, [it's here!](http://i.imgur.com/PHwE11f.png) 




 Ahh just the advice I was after! Thanks /u/reallycoolpeople. I was thinking of somehow installing a row of bulbs around the outer mirror and possibly adding a magnifying vanity mirror. 




 Interesting! I read that before the commercial jet was rolled out (1952), turbulence could be incredibly violent as aircraft were powered by pistons instead of jet engines and there was no cabin pressurization.
