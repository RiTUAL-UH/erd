 Sometimes I open the box and start eating while I'm still digging in my pocket for the check... 

I still pay pizza in checks for nostalgia....   (i tip the driver in cash fuck anyone who doesn't)

 I just remember all the news channels (except for NBC) were citing polls that justified Romney winning highhandedly.  

I remember being so stressed about him winning too.  I was sweating at the voting center wondering how many dumb fucks around me were going to vote for him.  

 I ate up all the predictions and was distraught hahah.  Maybe others were too and that's why they went out and voted.

 To be fair he didn't exactly run up against an awesome opponent.   He ran against weak candidates.   

SO...... pretty sure an adopted Detroit crackhead could have beat Mondale.   




 Yes he did.  The war was officially over.  He didn't give a fuck that the south rejoined the union and he burned his way from through Atlanta to Savannah.  

He was a crazy murdering fuck by the end of the war.    




 Dick Cheney's little Halliburton/KBR all killing our troops with open burnpits where they burned plastics, tires, metal, DU, medical waste, chemical barrels....

The did it upwind from the where everyone slept.  

24 hours a day there was this thick black smoke, making people cough up blood.  Some got cancer and some died of neurological problems.  Thousands upon thousands upon thousands of us breathed that shit every day.   

There is a lawsuit against them right now for that shit.   Just google Halliburton KBR open burn pits Iraq.    

Everything dick cheney touches becomes black and evil like him.    




 At the time all the polls were reporting a big defeat for obama.  And afterwards everyone was all blither blathering didn't know what happened..... 


And we still use those pollsters as "legitimate" today.

 I masturbate once in the morning and once at night.  Sometimes my SO helps... sometimes not.

At night it helps me fall asleep.  

in the morning  I seem to be in a better mood and less irritable during the day.   This has lead to great increases in my job performance.   

Jerk it twice a day, dudes.  You know... so you can win.   




 It's a shame really.  CA is so beautiful usually.  

I was just making a side of the mouth joke about drought in CA.    









 If you get into nova settings (which just change settings in the stock developer menu) you can change the speed at which it runs.   

I run with no eye candy, which just turns all the animation and transition scales to 0 in the dev menu.   

There is no cool graphical changes but it is very poppy.    

That's just my experience.  Sorry it doesn't work for you.   




 Are you into modding and roming?   

My nexus 5 is great batt life for me but I have heard of others having problems. Usually those people are just running stock.

Nexus is great for having fun flashing...  Just kinda boring outside of trying out the latest CM rom.   
 




 sitting here turning it off and on I can see a HUGE difference.   

Like a couple of seconds. (timer says 1.6 sec)  Both my exynos and snapdragon respond the same.   




 I regret nothing.  I made my choices and took the risks.  The government should say thank you by fixing me up.   They will... just have to slap them around a bit first.    




 To speed up the task switcher .  


Go to settingsapplication manager.    Swipe over until you reach the "All" list.  

Scroll down until you see an app called "talkback".    Turn that app off.   

It won't entirely eliminate the lag but it will half it.      

Also, roll the nova launcher.  You'll still have touchwiz features but without the slow jerky touchwiz launcher.    




 Bro... this isn't XDA, most people here barely even know what root is.   Much less how to get a custom recovery (if their bootloader is unlocked *cough usa phones cough*) and flash a kernel. 




 Oh bull. Both my Exynos and my Snapdragon ran like shit after LP.  I factory reset one time after that upgrade and it's been great after that.  

I don't even wipe between rom flashes.  I just dirty flash and it still runs great.  

Everyone has to do ONE little factory reset after a major update and they act like their phones never work.   Get a grip people.  




 Blame the userbase.  Everyone was screaming and crying about getting Lollipop that samsung released 5.0.1... when it should have told everyone fuck you, wait, and delivered 5.1.1.   

This phone deserves nothing less than that.   




 I'd say no if you're on the Note 3 or S5.  

Don't get me wrong the note 4 is AMAZING... but the difference between the note 3 and 4 isn't THAT amazing.  

Now the difference between 4 and 5 [rumor].... that's worth waiting for.    




 Holy S__T! Is there any way we can make this kid stop trying to make nickle sized blackholes????  




 How many of those people, after spending the money, felt jipped?   




 This and honest this.  

People with weak hardware can stay on WoW..... but computers and games have passed outdated WoW by.  

Make wow 2.   Give us a 3D globe map that navigates like google earth.   

Give us graphics updates.  and more in depth customizable character building. 

Even if they got started today, we wouldn't see anything for 5 years.    




 Yeah nothing keeps you in the starting area.   Although I think I did level up from exploration xp on the way there.   

Which made me ahead of my friend.   In hindsight, I think there is a way to freeze xp gain...  




 Is there a drought there?

 How likely would the delegates go against the results of the vote?    




 Revenge is just harming another to make yourself feel better.   So no I don't see any difference of harming another for satisfaction against harming another for satisfaction.   

If it was about justice you'd just put him down pain free with argon and nitrogen gas.   

You haven't yet expained why torture should be a requirement leading up to his death.   

Which means this isn't about his death or justice.   This is only about his torture.  And why would someone want to see another be tortured?   For personal satisfaction..... harming another to satisfy internal emotional desires.   

It is EXACTLY the same.   

Good day, crazy.  I'm turning off inbox replies now.    




 How's it feel to to dishonestly obfuscate in order to defend being a psychopath?    




 

Have fun being a psychopath.  Get help.  I'm serious as a heart attack when I tell you that.   Please.... seek.....help.    




 Yes.  A quiet, painless death.  Argon and Nitrogen.   Doesn't take long and then its over.  The person being executed doesn't even feel like they are dying.  

Justice served.  Bury him at sea.     




 That's an excellent point!   Just one question though..... what?  




 http://i.imgur.com/BQG1bIw.png 




 Or the nitrogen argon gas... quick... painless.... he doesn't even realize he's going.  

Then it's over.  Justice is served.... and no one is getting sick thrills off continued brutalization of another.    




 LOL Have you been on reddit lately?  It's always one extreme or the other... no one ever has any middle ground opinion.  

So when someone comes out and says it, it's nice to hear.  I know I'm not in some sort of singular existence... but there are so many here that are all "booo fucking hooo death penalty is always bad" and the others that wanna kill people for lesser crimes.  

SO... yeah... its nice to hear it every now and again.   

 




 I'm saying it doesn't fucking matter.   Because the person doing the  act is getting the personal satisfaction they desire from it.   

Money doesn't make it worse or better.  You're already as evil as you can get by sucking enjoyment from the pain of another.  Nice try on the obfuscation though... it was a really big stretch there, Armstrong.    




 Brutally harming another for personal satisfaction.   Nope they are both the same.   Have fun at the doctor, nutso.   




 Oh so money, not personal satisfaction makes it worse..... duh okay.  

Have fun being just as sadistic as him.  I don't know how you can find help for that.  See a doctor.    




 I love all the comments where people want to do all this fucked up shit to the man.   

So you're exactly like him then?  You just do sadistic fucked up stuff because they deserve it or you need to satiate some personal need for satisfaction?  


Edit: Too many strings of the exact same debate so I'll just put what I said here.  I'm done now thanks for the debates.   

Revenge is just harming another to make yourself feel better. So no I don't see any difference of harming another for satisfaction against harming another for satisfaction.
If it was about justice you'd just put him down pain free with argon and nitrogen gas.
You haven't yet expained why torture should be a requirement leading up to his death.
Which means this isn't about his death or justice. This is only about his torture. And why would someone want to see another be tortured? For personal satisfaction..... harming another to satisfy internal emotional desires.
It is EXACTLY the same.


As long as we continue to enforce our laws, by utilizing the same behaviors as the criminals themselves, we will see nothing other than the continued perpetuation of these types of events within our society.   

We must rise above our gnashing teeth and primitive selves if we are ever to make progress as a civilized people.   

Edit2: The arguments that "they deserve it" or "they are a monster" or "it is justified" are the same arguments that the government used to defend it's torture practices.  Looking at ISIS we can definitely say that those practices made life MORE violent for us.... not less.  

By allowing this sort of brutalization you say to the government that it is justified to use whatever means it desires to assert it's will.  And thus you have a society feeling more like it's them vs the government.  And most certainly the government will feel the same and will respond accordingly to protect itself.  

"Escalation of the situation" from the top down is what's destroying our society.  It permeates itself in our cops and criminals, in our political debates and our legislation.  

This shit's got to stop.    




 How's it feel to think exactly like the man you're killing?    




 Finally!  Someone who is like me. 

I'm not against the death penalty.   I'm against killing innocent people.  And we keep managing to kill innocent people using the death penalty.   So lets stop doing that until we can figure out how to institute a system where ZERO innocent people get executed.   




 What is that game... five nights at freddy or something... I can't see these character without thinking of that.

Other solutions are nerve blocks... those are temporary, risky, and I don't care to have more needles shoved in there.  

The solution is to remove my useless finger, and the muscle groups that are causing the pain.   I'm not using them... get rid of it so the pain goes away.   

I'll still have phantom limb... but all the other more terrible side of this pain will go away.

 When something is so sad that you can only laugh.   WTF I hate that.   

North Korea is still around because it makes communism look bad. And the USA likes that because as long as communism looks bad, China is de-legitimized.   




 puh... "minerals"   we got minerals every where else.  

They got oil?   




 We can easily shoot down korean technology missles.   So I think I wouldn't worry about that.  

Their artillery is very visible to satellites. And any type of fortified bunker they have our bunker busters can easily penetrate.  We can launch from ships, from planes, from stealth bombers.   

Our missle defense systems are a lot more advanced than we let on.   

I'm sure South Korea has developed plans to minimize civilian deaths after living under the threat of attack all these years.  No doubt alarm signals.   

So I think it would be over very very fast.  

It's not like fighting scattered terrorists.  Against a nationstate our military will dominate.    


































 I gotta say this place is dangerous as hell for motorcycles.   It is anarchy on the pothole filled roads out here and the massive yellow Bachelor Bus owns every bit of it.   


Thankfully, my accident today was just minor and DID NOT involve a Bachelor Bus passing a tricycle cab around a blind curve.   

Instead I got T-boned.   Fucked my leg up a bit and bent my foot peg flat.   I really really don't understand how I did not drop the bike.  

He decided the man stopping at the intersection of two highways had no good reason to do so.   Instead of considering the possiblity that the other vehicle may have stopped for oncoming traffic, the driver passes around him and shoots on into the street.   

I saw him shoot out at the last second.  I really did not want to get hit at an angle... especially with an oncoming truck that was overloaded with Copra.   I preferred going onto his hood instead of over it and onto the pavement.  Luckily I was rewarded with neither after jerking the bike into position.   I really don't know if that was the right move or not as I've only been riding on road for a year.   But it worked out.   

My back tire got busted from the lateral push on it... 

I just have a bruise on my leg that hurts a bit when I walk.    No bones broken, but metal part on the bike crushed.   Not sure how my leg isn't broken... or how I kept the bike up.  

But his front bumper got completely torn off.   Good that fucking retard.   Idiot then tried to fit the bumper in his back seat and couldn't figure out why the doors wouldn't close with it in there.   After threatening to call the cops and cursing his dumb pinoy ass out, he decided that throwing the bumper in his open trunk and speeding away was a good solution to his problem.   

I got the footrest peg sort of straightened out, but it'll never be the same.    

My poor little shitty Yamaha SZ.....  

After being forged in the fires of Anarchy and shitty road conditions, riding in the USA is gonna be a cakewalk.    Hope I don't get complacent.    

That fuckers car got fucked up  Good for him.... dumb piece of shit.    


All gear, all the time for me......  I'm gonna get the hard shin guards now.  









 [The 22nd amendment is worded that someone cannot be ELECTED to the presidency twice.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)   But can they ascend to the presidency.   

For example, if Obama was elected to the House of Representatives, and voted as Speaker of the House, and then both the president and VP are killed....  

Would he still be within the confines of the constitution.   

(it should be noted this is NOT wishful thinking.)   




 I've been living in very poor rural area of the Philippines for over a year.   No mirrors here and no need for one because you're just gonna be dirty, hot, and sweaty.

Ugh... 




 Public schools failed me by teaching incorrect comma usage as correct. 

They neglected the semicolon;  is it a period, comma, or period/comma hybrid? 

The Harvard comma; I've been taught is correct, incorrect, or doesn't matter.   

In public school I was literally told that parentheses are just the evolution of commas.  


Two spaces after period?  "Only when handwriting."   ..................... sigh.



Numbers :Was told only write it out if there is already a digit in the sentence.     


And of course when I took grammar in college the professor just said he didn't care about grammar because no one knew how to do it.  

After 3 weeks of learning nothing I just Clept the course credit.   No I STILL don't know, but have the credit that says I do, and that generally makes me a useless human being.  Because of this I am now against clept.  

Oh and I get corrected by grammar Nazis all the time but a lot of times they are wrong too so it doesn't help.  

Is there like a free online course somewhere that can help me???   I'm an approaching middle age and haven't the slightest clue.

 ++So I chose to use Chrome instead of the built-in browser.  The built in browser has full screen.  AFAIK chrome does not have a fullscreen setting... at least not one I can find.   

Well I really regret my decision now because the screen is now burned where the status bar is.  

I am now using the stock browser... especially on white screen you can see the "off white" of the main screen with a crisp very white bar where the black status bar is.  But the effect is very visible in landscape like while watching a movie or playing a game.....

I've tried several apps that claim this can be undone.  But none have worked and probably never will.  I spend many many many hours a day reading the Internet.  So the burn is likely permanent.  

And of course I'm Knox 0x1. 

Word to the wise... use fullscreen browsers if you are extremely heavy user like I am.  


Edit:  here is pic.  Also why would you down vote this?  I clearly stated this is entirely my own fault and did not act like the phone is the problem.

This story is a bit long so you may want to grab a snack and a drink.  


We will call her Jenny for this.   


When I first met Jenny, she was my girlfriends best friend.  My girlfriend accused me of having sex with Jenny, and broke it off.    I DID NOT have sex with her.  I was struggling with my own sexuality at the time.  I had not been having sex with my girlfriend for some time.  My girlfriend made this accusation upon returning from traveling to Alabama with her ex boyfriend.  I'm not stupid; they fucked.  And more power to them... I certainly wasn't doing it and had to think about dicks to even try.   Yep... I'm gay I remember realizing.   I remember telling myself, Fuck it who cares just be gay, dude.


Anyway.  Jenny and I became good friends after this ordeal.   When I met Jenny she seemed mature beyond her years but that maturity came with a child like innocence.   Sometimes objects would entrance her.  She would examine it closely and pick out the smallest details and appreciate their beauty.  All this while having reddit open, and learning about particle physics at the same time.   Oh and don't forget the octopus hat.  


I loved her so deeply.  In a non-romantic way.  


Jenny had problems in her past.  Her family was not very supportive of her.  I think they just didn't know what to do.   Jenny dropped out of highschool,after an off the record meeting with the school counselor; in which she was advised that she should do so.   The school didn't know what to do with her either.  Later I encouraged her to get her GED (good enough diploma) so that she could at least get into a local college. In order to take her, I got fired from my job for calling in sick and not providing a requested Doctors note.  Fuck that job anyway, this shit was important.   


Jenny was highly, highly intelligent.  She could figure anything out. She absorbed all available data that she could.  Johnny Five seriously yo.    


Jenny had problems socializing with others.  She liked big gatherings of people, but preferred to stay off to the side and observe while talking with the one or two people she felt comfortable with.   


After a while Jenny lost her job.  She was fired for poor customer service.   After that we did not have enough money to pay the bills.   And I detected agitation... or an increasing anxiety in her.   I knew she needed a doctor, but we had no insurance.    



So I said to Jenny, Why don't we just get married at the courthouse.  I'll join them military and you'll get medical insurance.  


And she agreed.   So that is what we did.   


At first it was great.  Jenny was excited about us moving.  Which was surprising to me because she did not like changes to her environment.   But she was okay with this.   


Then, I got deployed.... while I was away, Jenny began reading the news about the war.  Her agitation increased because she was completely dependent on me.   What would she do if I died?  Where would she work if she couldn't talk to people?    

And the news kept getting worse.  She kept reading all the links on reddit about government programs spying on us citizens.  About how people could hack into kinect and listen to what you're saying and watch you.   About how the government could tap into your cellphone and listen to the mic anytime it wanted.....  


Deeper and deeper into anxiety she sank.   Her ability to absorb data was astounding.  She would literally have hundreds of tabs open on her browser; and know what each tab contained.   So all this dark bad news she absorbed.   


When I got back, I discovered half completed wall paint projects all over the house.  I discovered unwashed gagging stink in the sink, of old ramen noodles, while the rest of the house was immaculately clean. 


The military medically retired me for the injuries I sustained from my time in Iraq.


She continued to refuse to see a doctor.   But after 2 years of random raging emotional meltdowns, she finally agreed to go.  Oh my goodness the meltdowns.  Her screaming and raging about how I shouldn't have a smartphone.  The government is listening.    She would bury her cellphone under blankets and insisted that we have double firewalls on the internet.   Oh and she smashed up the kinect and the entire Xbox after reading hackers could see you.   


The psychologist did some aptitude tests and other tests.  The psychologist called me in to discuss the findings.   Jenny was in the highest percentile for intelligence.  She should have been inventing fusion reactors.... 


But Jenny was also autistic.  Used to be called Asberger's syndrome but doctor said that was not a real thing and its just called Autism.     


The only experience I had with autism was meeting the cousin of a friend of mine.... this kid was in his own world and didn't talk.   But the doctor explained Jenny was had a high functioning autism.   


Around this time, I was to the point in my recovery that I wanted to use my 911 GI Bill to go to school.     Jenny had revealed that she just wanted a house in the mountains somewhere with no internet and lots of books.   The psychologist agreed that this might be the best thing for Jenny as her anxiety was virtually uncontrollable.   Jenny refused any type of medication.    

OK so I will go get that house in the mountains for you.   I needed to go to school and I wanted to work in ecology for national parks which are being overrun with invasive species of plants.  So I found a school that was perfect for me in Washington State.  

The psychologist explained that Jenny needed to learn how to be independent.  I agreed.  So I was given the okay by the doctor that Jenny would be fine if I left to go to school on the other side of the country.   The doctor said she would monitor Jenny closely, and have social workers check in on her at home.  


So I went.  I was gone for about one month.   The day before school was to start, Jenny had a massive meltdown.  Screaming over the phone at me how I abandoned her.   This hurt so bad.  I was doing this so that I could obtain the income to move her to the place she wanted in the mountains.  She kept screaming, FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!  FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!   And then she hung up the phone.   She had done this many many times before.  Often not speaking to me or answering my calls for days aftwards.    So I called the doctor and asked her to check in on Jenny.  The doctor said she would go visit in two days because she was out of the state.  The social worker was not answering her phone either.   

 

So I went to the orientation at the school the next morning.   Jenny was still mad;  not answering her phone.  


While washing my face in the bathroom I remember thinking, What if she killed herself?  


And then to my horror I said aloud, That would be a relief.   Then I cried for 20 minutes for having thought that.   I loved Jenny so much.  I just wanted her to be happy.  To recapture that innocence and wonder she had.   To live life without mistreatment from others.  I remember going and sitting outside her job at the mall and watch as the customers would abuse her.   


There was just something about the way she acted that invited people to scream at her and be rude.  I interfered with one telling the customer to back off.   Security then said I had to leave the mall and banned me.   Fuck them, those motherfucking asshat security fucks with their plastic badges and stupid hats they wear indoors.  That fat fuck couldn't see I was defending a family member against an aggressor.   Dumb fat fuck, with the front of his mall cop uniform untucked because his belly was jiggling below it like it was jello.    


I had to leave home because the orientation day was going to start.   So I went to school and tried calling every chance I got.   No answer.    But she's done this before.  I kept telling myself she would be okay.   


But that evening, I could not take it anymore.   So I called the police and asked if they would go check on her.   


The cop arrived at the house and called me on the phone.  He said there was no answer but he could see the rice cooker light on through the window and the car was still there.   


I told him to bust the glass on the door and enter the house.   He said okay and that he would call me back.   


Five minutes passed.   A goddamn eternity it was.   I called the cops phone.   No answer.   


Ten minutes passed.   Fucking cop won't answer the phone.    


Twenty minutes passed.   Surely its something really bad he found if he's not calling or answering his phone.    


So I call the neighbor.   Neighbor says that I better talk to the cop but its not good.    


With that information I tell myself.  Jenny is dead.   


Finally the cop calls.  He says,  I'm sorry sir I have to inform you that your wife is dead.   She hung herself.  The body is cold so we did not try CPR.  An ambulance is on its way.   We then hung up.    



I couldn't believe it.   I blamed myself for saying what I did that morning.  I thought somehow that is what caused this.   


Even though we were not sexually involved, we were still married and therefore partnered in nearly everything.  She was my best friend.  She was just an innocent bunny.   


I dropped from school, returned home to clean out the house.   And I saw it.... the hole in the wall above the closet.   And then I realized why I could not find my German Shepherd Dog's leash.   


Jenny hung herself with it.  And then I wept some more for about an hour.  Walking around the now empty house.  I was abandoning it.  I could not live there but could not afford to pay the mortgage and rent on a different place at the same time.   So I let it foreclose.   


But anyway.  I remember walking around in circles, in her bedroom, weeping and looking at the hole in the wall.    I just wanted Jenny back.  Sometimes almost believed that any second she'll come walking in while talking way too loud about some kitten picture she saw on reddit or showing me yet another printout of Einstein's face that she photoshopped onto a kitten.   


I cried like I never cried before. I was  slobbery, snot drenched, hot weeping mess.    And then suddenly it stopped.  And I was no longer sad but instead mad at Jenny.   


And I'm still angry.  It was just such a waste.  She was so damn smart.  Should have been giving gifts to all humanity with her scientific discoveries.   And she just quit life like that.   She didn't give a fuck about how anyone else would feel about her suicide and just left.   No note or anything left behind.   


What in the FUCK Jenny???????


And for 2 years I haven't told anyone about this anger or shown it.  I just say that I am glad she is not suffering anymore.  And I hope she's chilling with Einstein right now.


My life has moved on, I am now using my pension to do humanitarian work in the Philippines.  But dammit I'm still so mad at her.   I wish I could feel something other than anger.  Because I loved her and now she's gone.  She just fucking quit and left.  


So that's it.  Its off my chest I guess.   Not really.  I'll just bottle this back up and bury it inside like I always do.  I'll just press on with life and keep my anger a secret from everyone else.   And in private I'll say my usual, God fucking dammit Jenny.  What the fuck?    My prayer.   


TLDR:Please go fuck yourself, Lazy.   :p.  I asked nicely...


Edit:  what's with all the fucking hate mail?  I followed the doctors advice.  I also sacrificed my life to take care of someone who's family abandoned her.  I'm no saint... but at least I made sure she was fed, warm, and dry.  I gave her everything she ever asked for and more.  

If you don't have the fucking balls to say shit here for public scrutiny then you're just a chicken shit pansy.  Grow some balls.  (Wait no those are weak)  grow a vagina and then shove a watermelon out of it. Now you're a man.     Wait.... what?  Lol. 


Edit2:  writing this was incredibly therapeutic.  It's like something has been squeezing my heart and it just let go.  I cried for the first time since i was in the bedroom looking at the hole above the closet.  I will choose to be thankful for all the octopus hat wearing Einstein as a kitten moments.  I'm still not fully okay. .. probably never will be.  But at least the heart squeezing is gone.  Thanks reddit.   
 









 Furthermore, the magic full bars spot changes slightly throughout the day. The magic spot is always in the same spot is was at that time day previous.  So if it's afternoon, the magic spot is different than it was in the morning but the same spot it was the afternoon previously.  

At night the bars are full in every spot.  So maybe interference from the sun?  I know that increased sunspot activity caused problems with some communications.   But it can enhance some

 Ok so this happened over 20 years ago when I was in high school. 


I was a tad small for my age, not entirely bullied but physically I was inferior to all the other boys my age.  This would change later but I was a bit of a late bloomer.  Certainly, the size issue was a problem a few times in my New Orleans highschool.   I was one of the few white kids in the school.  So I always had to prove myself to earn respect.   And you did not want to find yourself without respect there.  


Biology class was about to begin so a couple of friends and I stop off in the bathroom.  The science hall shared this restroom with the special education department.  

In the restroom was a boy with down syndrome.  He had taken his pants entirely off, along with his underwear, to pee in the urinal.  

So my giggling friends dare me, "dude dude take his pants yo".

I immediately declined saying no way.  


Then they threaten me and say they will tell the whole school I'm a bitch and hang signs around the school saying the same thing.  

So reluctantly I agree to take his pants.   So I scoop up his pants and underwear and run straight out the bathroom and around to the exit door.  I threw his pants in the trashcan outside.   

Then I return to high fives and way-to-goes from my friends.


After all the laughter and celebration, I notice a teacher is agitated outside the bathroom.

  She yells inside, "Fake Name, it's time for class come out of there this instant!"  

Out comes this crying and moaning kid with a too short t shirt on, face smeared with tears, and nothing on from above his belly button down.  The entire body of students in the hallway laugh... at...him...


I was so ashamed.   I could not sleep that night.  The next day, an announcement was made asking for information in who stole his pants.    None of my friends ratted me out. 


I knew the right thing to do was to turn myself in and attempt to redeem myself through apology and punishment.  


But I thought that would make me even more popular for what I had done, because the news would spread who did it....  This was just a justification or rationalization for me being too afraid to get in trouble. 


Now, over 20 years later, I still feel just as guilty as I did that first night.  Solid in my guilt with the knowledge I was given an opportunity to turn myself in and make it right.  And I did not.  And I wonder if that scarred this kid for life.  If he ever recovered.  By his tears he clearly understood that someone was being cruel, for no good reason at all.  


TIFU??   No.  Today I became a real piece of shit.

 I'm sure this is adverse to the spirit of how reddit is intended to work; but I almost never sort subreddits by new.  Whenever I do, it feels like I am going through the pile of junk mail on Monday To find the damn letter I'm waiting for.  


So I focus only Hot or Rising. 

I will express my gratitude to those of you who do spend time upvoting on New items.  I often imagine you guys, down there in the dark filth, with a brassy saxophone playing and covered in pig shit; Madly shoveling through the piles of crap that just keep on pouring in...

For comments however, I love to sort new. I often find lots of good stuff there. 









 I'm in Southern Leyte Philippines until 2016.  There is absolutely nothing to do here except watch shitty bootleg movies.   In town there are several stores that sell DVDs such as "The Bruce Willis Collection".  The DVD, (that says Blu-ray at the top) will have 6 to 12 movies on it.  


These movies are always low quality of varying degrees.  Sometimes, I can make the pictures look a little better by playing with different interlacing; depending on the nature of the picture.  However, conditions can change between chapters; and I find myself clumsily picking different interlacing.  


So maybe someone can guide this ignorant fool.  Forgive me if I use wrong terminology while I attempt to describe. 


I need to know which interlacing is best for


1. When the edges are fuzzy.  (Yes I know about the sharpen edges settings and also the ones Nvidia ctrl panel)  sharpen edges can really fuck you when then image is blocky.  


2. When the image is blocky


3.  When the image Is noisy


4. Grainy images (like noisy but more like sand than snow)

5. Random pixelization. (Not like big stationary blocky but small random blocks that move with the image) 


I realize there will not be a magic wand that is going to magically turn this shit into 2K definition, but perhaps soothe the God Damn thing would be nice.

 1. Did you even read the 2nd amendment.  It clearly says "in a well regulated militia"

2. To be fair, internet, modern postal service, and the likes aren't really able to be used to deprive people of life.  

3. Yes... they wrote it exactly for that, I already said that more than once. except most of the threats at the time were bands of indians, and military units (both rogue units and enemy units). 

 




 Why?  Each amendment stands alone.   The wording of any other amendment has no bearing on the 2nd amendment.    

It clearly says "well regulated militia"   

That does [not] mean to our forefathers that people need assault rifles with shitloads of rounds in them.   There was no such thing as a machine gun when it was originally written.   To them. a firearm was slow... heavy... and not very deadly in a singular form.  It wasn't until entire miitary units, firing muskets together as one, that they became effective in bringing death.  

So you have to think... they didn't write the amendment with the idea in mind that one weapon in the future could kill far more people than 50 men firing muskets could.  They wrote it with the idea that communities could defend themselves without waiting for a military unit that could be weeks away (or never coming).  The idea was that public communities would own and regulate the weapons use... rather than allowing single individuals to build stockpiles of powerful weapons that were in no way managed by anyone other than that individual.   The forefathers were VERY MUCH about preventing any ONE MAN from holding too much power, but that MANY MEN TOGETHER (the people or the public) would hold the power.      




 The locked down devices prevent you from continuing to use your device on a new carrier.  So even once your agreement is done, the carrier still controls your phone.  So you paid money for something you don't fully own.  If you bought the non carrier unlocked model...you could still enjoy your device.   Many of the non carrier models have a wider range of bands they can use as well.    




 Triple shot u pussy.  And it has to be shaped like a boot for no fucking reason at all. 




 yeah but spread out over 30 sec 




 I always thought the 2nd amendment wording was strange.   To me it reads not as a right for every man to have a gun, but was the right for a civilian population to organize into a well regulated militia and stockpile arms for that militia.   

The supreme court had other ideas I guess.  

Edit: I'm not saying the supreme court is wrong in their interpretation.  I just think the original wording indicated a little bit more organization to owning weapons than simply straight up no checks or balance of power between individuals.    I don't think they wanted the GUNS GUNS GUNS dystopia the NRA (and their arms dealers support) would prefer having.    I say this as both a gun owner and member of the NRA. (which was a very different NRA when I joined) 




 Well it's too late for that now.  For all we know the manager could have been in on it... no matter what their gender is.   

Regardless, the store is in control of content which could be a legal liability for them.   So why not just delete it?  No proof anymore.  You can't sue when the police arrive and find zero evidence to your claims.  


Don't be a weak little shit.  When somone does this shit.  You go outside call the police and wait for them to arrive.  Don't challenge the violator because they'll just delete the pics.   YOu want evidence.        




 Why would you have NOT called the police immediately????  Way to go.  You're exactly the kind of victim he was looking for.  

Now it's a LOT harder for them to actually do anything about it.  Especially now that his manager gives him the heads up to delete it so that the store isn't liable.     




 Now this is what I was looking for..  Instead of "it just does" answer.   

Thank you for your great information.  I can now safely vote on this issue without feeling like my ignorance can do more harm than good.

 You don't buy the carrier phone.   You buy the unlocked models sold by third parties or Samsung itself.  

There is no bloatware on these devices.   




 The fact that it was a problem in the past makes the problems you illustrated more able to stand unresisted.   


SO I get a little miffed when I see people saying "This has been happening for a while" as if its just some small standard annoyance to our civilization.  When it should be MORE ALARMING that it's been going on for so long.   




 You're not buying a 2 year agreement when you buy a non carrier phone.   

And you don't have bloatware.  

You know why bloatware companies pay to reduce the cost of the phone?   It doesn't matter if you don't use their software.  They still make profit off the data the software on the phone is allowed to acccess.  

So no...it's not FREE.  They FORCE you to give them something.   And you don't even get a device you fully control in exchange or the freedom to change carriers with that phone once you're agreement is done.   So you don't own it.... you paid verizon to own your phone for you and tell you what you can and cannot do with it. And in this case... the carriers are telling people that their devices must not be secure. 

That's a big fucking expensive problem.


The money you save from not being locked into a contract alone is enough to cover the subsidized nonsense.   Before I quit that I couldn't get new phones.  Now, I pay my full price phones down in 6 to 8 months (sometimes less) and get an upgrade.   And my monthly bills for phone service have been about half on account of the buying power I gained from freedom.

 I'm in Southern Leyte Philippines.  Woman comes to me asking what she should do.  Woman is in her mid 50's and obese 

The wound was full of green and yellow puss before I washed it out with a bottle of saline from a first aid field kit.  

It took a good hour and half to get all the crap out of it.  I expected it to look a lot worse before I began cleaning the gunk off but here it is clean: 
http://i.imgur.com/fUN36HG.jpg

She says the wound is from Cellulosis.  She had this hole in her back for 4 or 5 weeks before visiting a doctor; who upon seeing the injury administered to her a pneumococcal vaccination as treatment.  Seems odd to me but I'm no doc so...  

(In a seperate case, this doctor gave a diagnosis of "weak lungs" to a 5 year old boy and placed him on anti-tuberculosis medication.  The boy was not recovering and during a visit to the emergency room was diagnosed and treated for pneumonia.  He recovered quickly at that point)

Back to the woman... After her vaccination she then came down with high fever and was generally unwell but managed to recover after 2 weeks of illness before coming to me.   

This is the wound now at 7 weeks old.   Is this something that needs to be stitched closed?  Do I need to transport her 8 hours away to the big hospital?  I don't really know what I'm doing... or how to bandage anything properly.  I just made a flat square of guaze and tape to keep it covered.  But I'm afraid the guaze will stick inside... eek.   

This is why I work Logistics.

There I did it in notepad.   It works.

 You misunderstood.  The wave is not pushing it back and forth.   The point of convergence between the two interstellar medium and solar wind is what changes; moving past voyager while voyager maintains is heading.  

This turbulent nature of the convergence of the two mediums is the most commonly expressed reason here.     


THe water and air simulation is just to visually represent the fluid dynamics that happens at the convergence point where the two separate mediums collide.    What the simulation shows is that the border between the two is turbulent and not just some instant border change. 

THAT'S IT.  It never LEFT as the media expressed it.  It just explains WHY the readings are occurring(and being misreported) while it passes through the convergence point.   

If you're going to refute a point, try not to change it entirely from what it is first.  Trying to act like I was saying it pushes voyager back and forth.... LOL   Never once did I say it was exiting and re-entering.  I only referred to its time spent in the turbulent convergence zone of the two mediums.

 He really is right.  I remember being young and having the perception of a song that I had been listening to on my walkman... and then have my view totally changed after having seen the video.

 True.  But the LOSS occurs from being locked into 2 year agreements and not being able to shift carriers as desired to take advantage of promotions.  

Also, the alternatives to subsidized (like edge) come with a huge hidden interest cost where the user pays MORE for the phone than it's regular cost than they would if they just utilized the interest rate on a credit card.   (not to mention the payment flexibility)

And then there is the added loss of dealing with problems caused by purchasing a locked down device that has bloatware on it and you're stuck with a broken device.  Sometimes the bloatware causes such huge problems with battery life the phone has to be replaced.   Again... time lost and time is money.  

If you are unable to afford a phone without selling your soul to a phone company for 2 years (or paying HUGE early upgrade fees) then you should not be purchasing a premium phone.   

The subsidized phones do two things.  Make 3rd parties free money and imprison customers to their carrier.   That's it.  (3 things if you count not being able to be fixed at home) 

Its much cheaper to buy it through credit card.  *And also many non carrier phone dealers will have payment plans on premium unlocked phones.*  Many of these dealers will forgive credit problems with a small downpayment.  Also, waiting to buy 4 or 5 months after release is a good way to get refurbished phones that are in brand new condition for a fraction of the cost.   




 If he checked and confirmed he should have broken up right then.  


There is no excuse to ever intrude upon a persons private space and snoop through their things unless their VERY LIFE is in danger.  

If it ended up she was completely innocent, then he is just some crazy snooper stalker guy.   How creepy is that?    




 What?  

Its wrong in showing how fluid dynamics work in a turbulent shockwave?  Uhhh no.  It was something shown at a Nye and Tyson talk to kids to get them to understand about theories behind how the shockwave works.   The water represents the interstellar medium of space.  The air blowing outwards represents the solar wind pushing it back.   

Is it EXACTLY what happens?   NO..... duh.   but it is good at showing some of the laws behind how it works.    

Next time don't just say "you're wrong" and walk out.  WTF is that????  




 The article was quoting a forensics investigator who stated that this was about how long it took for them to develop the exploits.    Which is true about... We see the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 being revealed today a huge exploit allowing remote access to data even if it is encrypted.  That phone is about 9 months old. 

No security is perfect.

[Source](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/03/25/291925559/your-smartphone-is-a-crucial-police-tool-if-they-can-crack-it)    

there was a longer article I am having a bit of trouble finding.  It appears some debates got out of hand and deleted.    




 Why would it change.  I stopped doing the subsidized thing with phones 2 years ago after reading a similar post.    

I SAVED MONEY.   That means i've been able to upgrade more often whilst my income actually went down.    




 Good to know.  Thanks! 




 Why would that be the answer?   

The answer should be to find out if she is cheating using less intrusive means.  It's not hard to figure out someone is cheating.  It's as simple as "i have to work today" when you really dont.   

The ends do not justify the means even if the ends justify an action be taken.   Two wrongs don't make a right.  Neither person here had any respect for the other.  So fucking break up and hopefully they'll both learn not to be dickheads in the future.   




 You can tell it's a frat samurai on account of the salmon colored armor.    




 Elsewhere in this subreddit is a whole discussion w/sources where they say they can.   

The police can just hook a device up to phones older than 8 or 12 months and unlock them because most have exploits by that age.  

The only ones they have to send to apple are new ones of which they get partial data from.  after about 8 or 9 months, exploits are developed and the police update their little tool. 


They don't need shit to get you data.  So it doesn't matter if you do fingerprint or iris or pin code... or what your legal protections are for them physically forcing you to unlock the phone.... it.... doesn't....matter.   They have your data if they want it.   




 People STOP BUYING SUBSIDIZED PHONES!   

All you get is a 2 year pain in the ass agreement that you can never be free from if you want to afford the upgrade.  

just buy the unlocked version on a credit card and pay it down in 4 months.   If you STILL can't afford it, then you should be doing something with your money other than buying a premium phone.  

There's a lot of places selling unlocked devices that offer financing too.    




 its because of the code it changes within the system processes or configuration files to allow itself.  Even if you remove the app, the separate code is there there able to be accessed.  

Now if the carriers didn't lock people's bootloaders down, everyone would have had a custom recovery installed and flashed a clean rom by now.  But once again all this hold handing the carriers do to "protect users" has actually put them at greater risk.   

And because the carriers have a real dick up their ass about letting manufacturers keep their devices up to date, a patch to fix it is just kicking it on the shelf at samsung.  Meanwhile the carrier just lets all their users phones shit the bed.   

We need the FTC to step in and say enough is enough.  Get the carrier out of the way.  All it needs to do is connect my call.  There is NOTHING about the software on the phone that will fuck that up.  The ONLY approval they should have over updates is when the update is to the radio.  But what's funny is, they don't even need to do that because unlocked users flash those all the time with no problems.  

There has not been a single case of modified phone software harming the network.  On the other hand, there seems be a shitload of locked down phones harming users going on.    




 You're on the exynos though... the article only lists the American carrier models as the ones at risk.  The international carrier free phones did not come with swiftkey.  Only samsung and google. (my 910c only came w/samsung)  swiftkey is different.  Swiftkey made a special bloatware version specifically for carrier model samsung phones.   This bloatware ended up being a bloated sack of ever expanding shitdemon. 

People, If you're on a carrier phone, and you were required to get it contracted to afford it... STOP DOING THAT!  Buy the unlocked versions only. Better to put it on a credit card and pay it down over 3 or 4 months than to get locked into a 2 year aggreement and no control over your own shit.    Don't let the carriers do this shit anymore.  People don't want bloatware for a good fucking reason and this is the biggest fucking one.    




 Accident warranty only covers it if you haven't voided your warranty, you are correct.  

People should just save that money and spend it on insurance instead.  ESPECIALLY if you root or play with bootloaders; you should have the 3rd party insurance.  its only 99 bucks to replace it if you brick it.   




 To be fair, it wasn't TRYING to kill humans.   It was just trying to fuck one of them.  Then it succeeded by using a bald lady to fuck Fred Jones.

 A good representation would be to take bowl of water and a straw.  Blow straight down softly until an indentation appears and grows slightly.   

If you observe the edges of this indentation expanded and shrink rapidly.  

The edge of the termination shock is sort of doing the same thing... which is where voyager is. It's not leaving just returning readings of the turbulent convergence point of the two medium of interstellar space and solar wind.     

It is caught in the turbulence of the edge.   

Edit: clarifications. 




 away from it.  




 No, you dote, Voyager is in the Gamma Quadrant.  Broccoli hasn't rescued them yet! 



 




 No.  

Because the people who can figure out how to do it will go to XDA or Rootzwiki and follow information that already exists.  

If you do it here, every derp in the world will try it, then fail... only furthering the cause the carriers have to continue locking this stuff down.

 Thus enters the Patriot Act and all that secret court shit. 

Apple cannot unencrypt the system portion of the device.  That requires your password as the key.   

The rest is not encrypted in the same manner and for whatever reasons likely to remain secret, Apple is able to respond to these warrants with retrieval of partial data.  

All these companies were required to keep backdoors in shit because of the Patriot Act.    




 Ahhh the height I saw the world as a child.... 

Thank you.    




 I don't think I can let it go for that.

 WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE WHERE YOU BUY UNDERWEAR?! WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?! UNDERWEAR IS UNDERWEAR! IT IS UNDERWEAR WHEREVER YOU BUY IT! IN CINCINNATI OR WHEREVER!! 




 If it is encrypted, they can get it unencrypted by apple with a warrant.   They don't get 100 percent of data but they get anything that is important.  TXT messages, phone records, contacts, and media files.   

They cannot get into the system of the phone though.   So they "don't get 100 percent"  




 The ends do not justify the means.

It'll stop you from drinking wine that has already turned to vinegar too.... 




 Staying together and making it work does not equal total trust again.  

No matter how long it's been.... it'll always be there.  In the back of your mind.    You can't unlearn it.   

You could spend 40 years afterwards in a completely blissful marriage.  And if the cheater were to go alone into a room with another female... or drive with one in his car... Or on his walk you see him wave hello to the lady down the street and she returns his greeting with a big sloppy tongue kiss....   you'd wonder.  and if you say you wouldn't you're a damn liar or a fool.   


Edit: All kidding aside. you'd still wonder even if all the actions were innocent.  You'd still wonder if you need to wonder.  Past experience guides future behavior.  You really don't just undo betrayal.    
 




 Even if they aren't cheating; once you stoop to secretly checking the other persons private things, the trust can never come back.   Snooping email, text messages, looking through their files, and combing through their internet history is wrong.  Don't do it.      

They could be completely innocent, and you're snooping through their things.   The relationship is over at that point because the communication is not there.  Neither is the respect.     




 Its clear she is a liar.  Not really sure how you could think anything else...   




 ok then.  thanks! 




 Girlfriends don't have to be ~~alive~~ real.


Edit:  Wait that looks bad.  I mean... get a doll or a fleshlight then.   They won't cook you eggs or cuddle but they are always awake and ready. 




 It would be worth it in the form of a tax write off.    




 wut?? 




 you can easily launch planes from an aircraft carrier.  

One problem though.... neither of those things are a canoe.    




 Yeah but this isn't the case because the amount the bar increases between each block is like a quarter of an inch. Soooo that's large enough not to be an illusion.    




 But he didn't already know what his girlfriends pussy smelled like? 

He was talking about it like he knew it was hers.  Like he was smelling it for the first time.  She was hot so he expected it to smell good and was surprised when it did not.  

  




 my blood type is AB 




 I love it when pure, simple truth makes me get that feeling inside I can't explain.   Its just.......   BOOM.     




 its too complicated.   

Just say, "These aren't yours?"   

When she says no...throw them in disgust, freak out and start washing your face.  

She already knows you were sniffing the panties.  Girls are too smart to believe all that complicated nonsense. The best lie is the simplest lie.  They will, however, believe that you're a doofus moron, pretty easily.   

Play the fool.  




 netflix should give their services away for free to hospitals everywhere.    




 Set your alarm 15 minutes early.  

2 fingers,  find the nerve bundle little ways down from your glans on the underneath side of your shaft.  Rotate fingers in fast circle.   Bust a nut in like 2 min.   Blow it into the tissue.  Then fuck your girl for the remaining 13 min while you still have morning wood.   

You already blew your load so... its whatever but she'll get off 2 or 3 times because of it so that's fun.   *Just don't put her in one of those I just got amazing fucked comas.*  She's got shit to do today too.   

The eggs she'll cook you while you're in the shower will taste amazing.    

Nothing can bother you at work that day.   Its like a fucking paladin shield.   And damn those eggs burp good.     




 yeah... if the only thing you have is to sit there thinking about how sick and uncomfortable you are, it's going to make getting better a lot harder. 

Keep the patient distracted at least.... it'll make everything else so much easier.  Rather than deal with a pissed up, uncooperative, angry patient..... 




 Dammit it was almost out and this post made it crawl back up.... 




 you know stuff....thats cool 




 Ah ok.  That makes sense then.  Thanks!   Reddit is neat.    




 Uh yes he was.  He created a whole type of warfare called ["hard war"](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/rethinking-shermans-march/?_r=0) that involved starving civilians to death and shelling innocent towns.  

He stripped the civilian population of food on his march... even though he had more food than his soldiers could consume.  They'd take it anyway.   

The only people he did not kill were the one's that got out of his way and allowed him to brutalize others.  If you resisted at all, say to protect your last remaining cow, you and your whole family were dead.  

So it's often said "Sherman's March did not include mass killings"   That's true.  Instead, they were precision targeted killings.  Personal vendetta killings.  A die in a fire killings.   Killings of the most desperate who's backs were against the wall.

Ultimately, [his idea of war](http://www.historynet.com/general-william-tecumseh-sherman) was to make innocent civilians suffer as much as possible before they died.  

Also, Sherman seeded the term, "The only good indian is a dead indian" as a shortened version of his original words ""The only good Indians I ever saw were dead."   

So yeah... he loved killing.  And he loved it to be close and personal.   [And he loved inflicting as much hardship and pain as possible before doing so. Because his desire was to "make them howl."](http://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/shermans-march)  




 I'm in Southern Leyte philippines.... we aren't exactly riding the bandwidth super highway here on a shitty Edge network that is commonly slower than 1x.   In town I can get H+.  But it's really only 2G speed.    




 Or like mixing abilities.  Of course you'll always have your pure builds.  But this everyone the same shit is stupid.  

And stop making encounters so that you HAVE TO have a specific class/build there.   The encounters should be dynamic to provide a challenge and an incentive to keep basic needs covered.... but let people get creative.  You might see some amazing shit happen during a boss fight then.  Instead of every single encounter being exactly the same, you're gonna have encounters change and evolve somewhat each time.   




 He talks too?  Awwww it's so ugly it's cute!    




 Which means what in regards to the Israeli problem?  Not diddly shit.    




 Check out this Trollololol 




 That's an excellent point.  Just one question though..... WHAT???  




 Oh so because one group is wrong then it's okay for the other group to be wrong too.  


Duhhhhh OKAY!  




 I kumbaya mother to fuck.    




 Remember when 1 hour photo came out?   At the time it seemed almost like instant reviewing the pic.    
























 Huh?  What advantage could netflix have by asking this question?  It'd obviously have more against it than for it.   

I asked because they were talking about it on the "news" today.   




 I like that "netflix free" idea.  

Would be nice to be able to catch their series for free with ads.  It might actually drive people to sign up for ad free subscription.   









 With the exception of Everquest, Runescape is probably the biggest old title game around right now.    




 You're a superhero; but would you feel cooler if your last name were West?  




  FPH: Fucking People Heavywhere.    




 Stay off of INTERNET personals everybody.  


FTFY 
 




 It's subjective. 




 So you don't advocate a gun on every mans hip like in the old west?

I've heard the argument (and I don't know that this is true) that hollywood gunfights didn't happen that much in the old west because every man was armed.  The "mutual assured destruction" argument. I guess.  

I have slow internet in the philippines but I'm only seeing a couple  of real big gun battles in searching. Like Kansas city and tombstone.  Tombstone's gun battle is actually overstated a lot.  

So I guess in early search I can kind of substantiate that claim.  We certainly didn't have near the deaths we are currently having.... for whatever, probably multiple, reasons.   




 That's patented tho.... so it really doesn't matter if the original is still there.   

That's how companies get protected from scammers making a copycat iphone.   The whole reason for the patent system is so that peoples shit doesn't get stolen. 




 Yes but does his exective power extend to unilaterally changing drug classifications?  I thought it was congress that had to do that.    




 "Remember to play in the street all day, Kids!"  


I'd be such a good dad. 




 That's true.   But saying "white people are superior" isn't really threatening or terroristic as "lets hang all black people".     

The later is a direct threat of actually harming another, whilst the former is just uttered nonsense that we should point and laugh at in a shaming manner.   

One is the very definition of a "terroristic threat".   The other is not and could never be construed as such legally.   

Public shaming works.... to a degree.  Until you drive them all together and underground.   Then once they are excluded by society, they have no reason to follow that society's rules.  

So in a way, you shrink the size of the groups but in being cornered they lash out more.   

That's a whole different can of worms.   

I would most certainly feel threatened if I were black and whites were running around saying they were "superior".... but probably not as worried as if the whites started saying "lets kill everyone who's not white".  

Edit: Bananas and touchscreens  




 Try reading.  He's in one thread defending stealing.  Then he's in this thread arguing the opposite.   I suspect you're his alt.  




 It's good.  I read it all.   It was informative without being a long say nothing word salad. 




 Thanks for all the info.  You've given me a lot to chew on for a while.   

Hard to cut through the hysteria when the topics of guns comes up.   So it's hard to really allow opinions to evolve in that environment.    




 Does Obama have that power? 




 Yeah... no Asian immigrants is how our railroads were built. /s 




 Until reading your post I have been against the electoral college.   Kudos on the CMV on that. 




 Only if they engage in violence or threats.... 




  but at its core states rights was always about the right of slavery.

 What????  

No.... States rights has been used to defend slavery but that doesn't mean that's it's sole purpose; which is to keep the federal government from micromanaging states.   So chill with the dogma... 




 Yeah I'm a bit on the fence with that.  I do know that we don't need assault rifles with huge magazines on the street. Weapons of war have no business flooding the streets.   But like you pointed out there is no way of undoing that without forcefully stripping people of them.  Which is more wrong than having them in my mind.   At least mandatory training and safety classes would be nice. 




 I think I might have not communicated correctly.  I mean if we did not infringe on our rights to own weapons then there would be non such thing as illegal sales. Because every single sale would be legal no matter what.

 




 It's both sort of.   This is how violent criminals get their hands on so many unregistered firearms.   It sort of fuels the black market.

Edit:  although there would be no need for a black market if we just stopped restrictions on gun purchases in every state.  

 




 Thanks!   Wyoming says fuck you.

During the summer we would coil individual vines around stakes and lay them on a ruler.   You can literally see it moving slowly... like watching a shadow move from the sun.

 It's not about the ashtray.... it's about winning the fight. 




 I'm just saying if it's not on Netflix or hulu why would I sign up for a third temporary service just to watch it.   

Just make the content available... then I might have been enticed to watch it on TV for the current season.  

The point is,  with all the other available content, Imy not going to go out of my way to watch something that takes going through a signup and cancellation of service process.

They killed themselves.  That's not my fault, that's their's for choosing to limit the size of the audience their content reaches.


It's like putting ice cream shop at the top of a long flight of stairs whilst 2 other ice cream shops are already positioned at the bottom.  Unless your product is immensely better and your prices lower, few are going to take the extra trip to visit you. 




 You should be embarrassed for yourself and trying to justify theft as "common sense".  Get out of here with that nonsense.    Good job on your faux embarrassment over me calling you out on your immensely huge B.S.

Good day. 




 Look at how mad he gets when his hypocrisy is displayed to the world.   Wow!   Have fun getting your door kicked in for stealing copyright material because you were too cheap to pay for it. 




 [Umm you were just in another thread making excuses for stealing the content.](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/3ar4ap/nbc_has_canceled_hannibal/csfbfy7) 




 Yeah. Wtf is he talking about the selection is bad?   Sure some of it his lower budget on average but as we've seen recently, simply throwing a ton of money at a project doesn't make it any good.

These people are just thieves.   And they want any lame reason they can think of to serve as an excuse for being leeches. 




 Bro... he has to PAY for it then.  He clearly just wants it for free and all these lame overstated reasons are simply justification for theft.  




 I get its hard to watch it... but stealing it is not the solution.  It's hard to buy a car.  That doesn't mean you just take whatever one you see on the street. 




 Yeah but you can't keep doing free trials everytime a show is on tv.   

The point is its a pain to access it... so why do it?  There are si many other shows that are available that aren't so difficult to access.  


 




 I couldn't hardly get through the first season.  It was so gratuitous and bad. 




 I've owned a lot of trucks and I don't think I've owned one with vents in that location since the 90s.   I don't know where they are now... but not there.   

Regardless those vents wash all liquids away from where the air is pulled in.  

Most people use recycled air settings as it is more efficient and you don't smell the pollution from other cars in front. 




 I'll just pick up some tomatoes, cucumbers, and 80 kilos of calcium hypochlorate.

Do these parasites reside within the vegetables or can they be washed off?   




 Yeah... and they sell them to WA and Org.   No one said the beer had to be brewed in the state that consumes it.  It was a joke anyway, Mr. Know-it-all-correct-everyone. 




 That's it.   




 Who is they?  




 As a basement dwelling expert my twinkies don't have ecoli.

 Cali only. Oregon and WA just drink obscure piss tasting small brewery beer and type on typewriters in the most ridiculous places. 




 That's it I'm not eating anymore so that I can live forever. 




 Dude... Fucking cool it. 




 turns out its way up in the fucking sky like on morrowind. 




 Well yeah... no one is paying tax really at that wage level.  

Americans are about manufactured crisis.  Gotta stop all those tax dodging food servers.  When it's REALLY about giving businesses a pass on paying people a wage they can live off of. 




 If he doesnt die of old age by then....  He will be 79 at the end of his first term...  He better have a damn good Vice President for me to vote for him because odds are that VP will be required to replace him. 




 Well this pope isn't likable to the whole world.  

He pissed a lot of people off here in the Philippines; where the demands he made for his visit required money for Yolanda recovery to be diverted to his needs.  Then he dipped out as soon as a small tropical storm hit.  I guess he didn't have enough FAITH that God would keep him safe.   




 feeding stray animals is illegal?  




 Well the whole reason they make less than minimum wage is because tips cover the difference and also taxes.  

If you erase the difference then the only reason is taxes.  The law was originally passed on the premise that servers were not reporting their tips and not paying taxes on them.  

So.... how do you get people to stop tipping after it's no longer necessary.  Otherwise you just go back to the same problem of people getting tax free income. 




 That was like 12 hours and everyone came back cause voat sucks  




 Those aren't dicks... this is eggplant beer.   




 Did you jokers not even read the link he posted as the source?  

It already says this right at the top.  

An aerator serves the following purposes:
Prevent splashing

Shaping the water stream coming out of the faucet spout [clarification needed]

Water conservation and reduction in energy costs

Reducing faucet noise

To increase the perceived water pressure, (often used in homes with low water pressure)

  




 These sinks really aren't for washing hands.  They are supposed to be for cleaning foods; especially fish (after/during scraping scales off) and produce.   

Not really sure why they put this in the area where you wash hands.... 

 




 Look bowls have not reached vintage status yet....  




 Well to be fair... the entire empire was after solo and even they had a difficult time capturing him.   

He had to get fucked over by a friend to make it happen.  Han Solo is a smuggler... so escape and evade is kinda what he is at the core.. I mean.. he's the brass fucking ring when it comes to capturing. So I don't really fault boba for failing at that.   




 Immitation is the highest form of flattary.   




 I liked, in Star Wars, how all the props and costumes would have dings and scratches and other signs of wear and tear.  

When everything is shiny and in perfect condition it is easier to tell it is fake or made of plastic or whatever. 




 I have never been paid minimum wage for not making any tips.  I was a waiter for 6 years.

 




 I cannot substantiate these claims based on my experience. 

I travel the world on the regular and I get the shittiest service in the USA. Because the workers are stressed and it shows.   




 you're tipping the business by subsidizing the low wages they pay.


This makes me feel something inside.  I'm not sure if it's anger or what... 




 I lived off being a waiter for many years.  Yes I had big nights where I made hundreds....

I still would have taken regular pay over that.  

Because my landord doesn't take the "tips were shitty this month" excuse on late rent. 




 How would you get people to STOP tipping after such law is passed?  




 The smell: Is it fresh and cooking? 

Look at the cooks:  Are they clean?  

Thats it. 




If the food looks 2 hours old and the cook has more dirt on his clothes than the bottom of his shoes.... then it's a true hole in the wall.   




 Oh BOLLOCKS!

Or is it Japan?  




 THIS!  THAT'S MY PROBLEM!  I have been fighting messy writing for years and as I write more neatly, I realized how painful it was after just a page and then I got sloppy again.    I never realised it was because I am fighting myself. 




 To err is human.  
To Arr is pirate.   

I saw that written on the wall of a pizza place here in Manila. 




 Why don't you lefties learn how to write from right to left?    




 I agree except for the war part.   The president is Commander in Chief.  Congress still had to declare war as it did with both Iraq and Afghanistan.   

If the president orders an air strike for immediate response I don't think we should be opening impeachment.   

Commanders have always had a little leeway in their operational parameters without having the order to attack come from above.   We should not handcuff ourselves from immediate response.   I think our system for engaging in war is still okay.   


I'm not sure if you're one of those people that think all combat=war but as a combat vet I'd take issue with that.  Can't sit around waiting for Congress to bicker about declaring war whilst some group of people rape and murder or attempt to take over.   




 Do you think the volitile nature of modern politics would be capable of writing a constitution that stands for over 200 years and works as well as the first one? 




 That's true.   Like the prohibition and then it's undoing. 




 You know I never looked at it from this angle.  

I'd worry about not having a bill of rights.... but i can see where having a constitution has made a lot of aspects of modern day life more difficult.  It isn't clear any longer how the old constitution should be interprered and applied for the modern world.  Society, culture, and technology have changed so much.   

I like this... you pick option C out of A and B.     you're the man.  I never even considered simply not having it. 









 You are so FUCKING ignorant.   50 years ago there werent many institutions to check ones self into.   And they were more like torture than actual help.   


I'm turning off inbox replies.   You're so ridiculous dude!   Gotta be trolling.... 




 Yeah which would make your point moot.... so obviously you typed that without actually believing it.    I assumed you left out a word because it completely contradicts your original point that he should have done something about his illness.. 



HE FUCKING DID 

 




 If you actually read about him it turns out he did ask for help.  But 50 years ago was the dark ages for mental health care.   Seriously consisting of techniques like blood letting, electric shocks, and shoving spikes into the patients brain....

I'm done here.   




 Bro... when are you going to stop demanding that an unhealthy irrational mind should function like a healthy rational mind?


You need to check yourself in..... 




 It wasn't an option because he wasn't capable of making the decision.   Good Mental health care was pretty much non existing existing at that time.  


Stop talking now.   You don't know what you're talking about. 




 So... you know how many sick people do that and still don't get help?  Writing does not equal the capacity to make a decision to check yourself into a place that has reputation of torture. Insane Asylums at that time are a place you didn't want to be.

Keep talking and embarrassing yourself by displaying a deeply flowing ignorance. 




 Especially during his time.    Holy cap!    




 What?   You clearly don't know anything about mental health.    Obviously a mind that is broken is not going to have rational thoughts like " maybe I should go to an institution".  


Also the insane asylum during this time was not a place you want to go.   




 Makes you wonder how many people we kill in execution that may have a health problem effecting their choices.   




 Plus the **GENUINE HORN W/KILL PHOTOS** will pull a higher price.    




 No... it'll be a selling point.  

"Genuine Horn" with photos of the kill... .people will pay MORE for it than they do now.   




 Yeah but they were all in a coma. That's how it stays plausible.  
























 Exactly.   

But going to 11 across the board is ridiculous.   

It doesn't mean Racism is over... but at least we can make it so our government doesn't fly racist symbols as their flag.   It makes me sick that everyone else wants to turn this whole thing into a ridiculous joke.    




 So I'm playing this complete waste of a time money stealing game SimCity BuildIt.   I'm at the level where schools became available and the people are asking for them.  But they are 40,000 and I refuse to pay real money to buy fake currency.  So I earn the money by actually playing the game.   

Needless to say, at this level, 40,000 takes a long long time to earn from crafting alone.   If I level up, Police stations will become available and they'll start begging for that AND schools.   But money is tight.  

So I finally earn enough to build the damn school.  And just before I'm about to place it I see a complaint bubble that there are no schools.   Resenting the time I just spent earning this damn school I decided to retaliate.   So I placed it in the low value shitty land in the pollution zone near the factories.  

After I did it I felt vindicated.  Take that, you selfish bastards.   And then I thought.... OH so this is why this lame shit happens IRL.  

Can we PLEASE turn our government inside out these next couple of election cycles?  If not for all you lazy dicks not voting....

Swarm the polls.  Vote out incumbents. (unless they have a verifiable record of not being a corporate hack and/or a dickhead.)  Leave the Bernies in office.  No matter what their party is, if they have a record of staying true to the people, DO NOT VOTE THEM OUT.   Keep them.  Vote out all these other rich knob polishers.      




 As a previously well practiced BMX rider, I'd welcome these.  I might slow down a tiny bit so you can really see how cool it looks.    




 This whole thing is RIDICULOUS anyway.  A mockery is being made out of the issue of taking this flag down from our public buildings.   

Apple just removed games from their store that had the flag in it.  Nevermind if it might be a game about the civil war...............................

Mockery.... a fucking mockery is being made from the issue.   And that's how the issue gets marginalized.  

 




 It's cool.  I just thought the story was a bit out of perspective for the terrible disaster that was Katrina.  

I mean... everything was flooded and we had dead bloated bodies everywhere of people that died of dehydration....in a flood.   

And then there's this story about someone blowing precious life saving water on some fish.   Don't get me wrong... I love my pet fish.  But people are dying out there, John.     




 Oh I'm not talking about peaceful protest.  What a joke protesting.  Protesting is like stamping your feet in a toddlers temper tantrum.  


I'm talking about peaceful polling.  There isn't a lot they can do about 90% voter turnout.   You turn it inside out.     




  What's an assault rifle going to do against a tank?  Nothing.  So instead, it gets used in a different manner that harms innocent people.  Which gives cause for the police to continue increasing arms and owning tanks.  Because we have weapons of war on the street; we need weapons of war to combat it.  It's a goddamn arms race.  And a civilian won't win an arms race.    

The national guard would just get called in anyway.  National guard is full of mouth breathing morons that would just blindly follow orders just like they did in the 1960s.  And many of them are just itching to play big time tough Active Duty Soldier Boy.   I had the unfortunate experience of working with these guys in Iraq.  Fucking morons, with their big time attitudes, thinking they were heroes; and doing stupid shit that got people hurt.    

Any revolution we have needs to be non violent.  Because our stupid little guns won't protect us.  Anyone who thinks guns can protect us from government weaponry is willfully dishonest with themselves about reality. 

And people say "oh the military wouldn't do that".   As a vet... fuck yes we would follow orders.   There would be some desertion as there is in ANY war... but ultimately even the military has an US and Them (civilians) attitude.   

These weapons don't do shit to protect us from tyranny.  Our revolutions need to be peaceful for them to work.    




 Time to argue about rusty nails and tetanus... reddit rules. 




 Front Line Assembly... it was in the late 80s I first heard them.  I was on a road trip to texas.  I was 10 years old.  We stopped at a gas station.  There was a spinning display of cassette tapes in the corner.   I picked up one on the back side that had a cool picture and was dusty.  

I get in the car and popped it into my walkman... it was like NOTHING anyone ever played on the radio.  It was so suspenseful the music.   I was on the edge of the seat waiting to hear what would come next.  And the beats made me want to drum on stuff.   

I was hooked.   I will enjoy everything they make... even if it's not the same now.  I don't care.  Bill Leeb, in yourself and do whatever the fuck you want. 




 My whole family didn't have water for two weeks. 

My uncle died of a heart attack after the national guard just threw the water out the helicopter and it busted open on the ground.   

I'm real glad these fish had water though.

 Wow I should have sent my size in.   @ 11.5 inches.  

And this is not bragging.    There is nothing cool about having a massive cock and sex is always terrible because the depth capacity of vagina just isn't great enough.  

So, I wish I could, but never will, have the sensation of sinking in "all the way to my balls" that I keep hearing about.  Apparently the feeling is the bee's knees....I wouldn't know.

And blow jobs?   What's that? Blow jobs are so terrible when you are a longer size.  

Underwear?    Boxers or gtfo... and the tip still hangs down.   Anything with "brief" in the name is very uncomfortable.   

And sports suck because even with a J - strap  it gets in the way.  

Most girls are afraid of it, especially when i take it out on the subway.  And when I sit with slacks on, everyone hawks at my massive jiggly bits pant mold. 




 No... those were the 52 inch kickwears.    The Jnco Jean's were still pretty accessible.    

I used to skate vert in those massive kickwears.    I have no clue how I pulled that off but we did it. 




 Congratulations, Kevin Smith.   We need you here with us so I am happy you are getting healthier.

By the way, the perps of this crime [were never indicted](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/07/us/georgia-toddler-stun-grenade-no-indictment/).  It's perfectly okay, in GA, to blow up baby faces.  So, this really should become ground zero for continued research into infant facial resiliency.     




 True... but it's those 9 judges that check the power of congress.   

Do you want the judges to be the yes men of a corporate bought congress?  
 




 Look at the supreme court.   

Think about how much influence the next president will have because 2 or 3 judges will need to be replaced under the next administration.   


IT IS SO SERIOUS THAT  EVERYONE REALIZES JUST HOW MUCH THE NEXT PRESIDENT MEANS BEYOND SIMPLE LEGISLATON.   


The Supreme court can be a corporate fuckjob... or it can be built with people that actually resect the rights and power of the people.    

 




 *I wanna know so bad it's making me do the pee pee dance!* 




 He completed 2 out of 3 parts of the ritual voluntarily.  He was interrupted by V'Ger  The new Spock did not do any part of it.  He rebelled from the beginning.  

Edit: It's arguable that there are three basic emotions: Fear, Happiness, and Love. Thus, the three part ritual to remove each set of emotions. The original Spock removed fear and happiness but was left with love.  This love motivated him to do a great many illogical acts for the sake of his crew and love of a dear friend.  

New Spock, having completed zero parts of the ritual, displays his fear, unhappiness, and love quit often.  And as we know, angry/feeling vulcans are basically just Romulans.      




 No no... Now you're trying to back peddle.  Can't even take ownership of your own words.  I'm embarrassed for you.    I refuse to engage in this.  Goodbye.   




 You could drill small holes and put tiny low lvl  UV leds behind it?  




 I'm sorry, your posts are so contradictory from one to the next that you couldn't possibly be the same person.   You went from saying anyone who claimed the USA kicked ass was naive.  Then you flipped and claim that no one is claiming what you just said.  

I have to admit.  I am confused because you can't seem to make up your mind which position to take and refused ownership of your own contribution to the conversation.    




 Nope.  We're done.  **WE DID IT** 




 No even came close to suggesting that.

Except the guy I replied to just did.  Did you read????  Or perhaps you haven't yet figured out how to read the conversation chain on reddit.   Just skip to the end and shitpost.   




 You're lucky that you aren't a slinky. Get well.


[I started thinking about this.](http://imgur.com/gallery/JrM4Cc6)  




 Well you have to consider that Spock in this timeline has not yet purged all emotion in the Kolinahr.   

So he's more violent and disturbed.   He's an angry spock.    




 Look at the Supreme Court.  The next fucking president is so fucking important because of the possible number of judges he/she will get to appoint.  

Everyone better think long and hard who they want with that power.  I'm as serious as a heart attack on sunday evening.  




 Reaches up gently so not to knock it in.... has a been-playing-hockey-all-day-muscle-twitch and accidentally bumps it in.  


Take that hockey gods.     




 I agree.  it's making a mockery of taking down the flag from our public buildings.   




 It's a micromachine commercial!! 




 Look pal, its hot in here... I don't wanna talk. I wanna stand awkwardly or pretend to clean whilst waiting for you to squirt your magic freon juice into those tubes and make this work.  

If the silence gets weird, I'll just bother you with more crazy stories; about how it used to could and now it can't.    




 It always seemd like the more meds I was on the shittier my health got.  

Once I refused pills I got better.  I basically had a choice between having the original condition or having a multitude of other conditions and risks. 

I hope I don't get pancreatic cancer.  I really fucking hope that and 2 meds I was on came with that risk.   

So I'm not really so sure that these "advanced drugs" are really the miracle of capitalism that they are made out to be.   Funny listening to the speed talk side effect speech at the end of drug commercials.  Which happens less and less these days it seems.   But look on the box and HOLY SHIT! Possible side effect "death".  WTF!    I'm gonna have a leaking anus whilst worrying about checking my eyes for yellow every day. Sign me up for monthly subscription to that!  




 Ummm the title you clicked to get here says it bro! 

WEeeee Shitpost rain!    

downvote me here.    




 Oh no worries.  This is a shitpost thread.  It's supposed to be here.

 There is the argument that Germany invaded eastward because it knew the fall of the west was coming. It needed breathing room but ended up being just an extra nail in it's own coffin.  

Yes the USA did just kickass and take names.  Germany was powerful adversary.  They were already there, dug in, with defensive structures in place.   You don't chip away at that sort of situation without being a total badass.  Taking fortified territory is one of the hardest things to accomplish in warfare.   You don't do it by being a pussy... or by being unclever.  Which the USA had to be since it's equipment had to come from half a world away.   We couldn't just load up dozen C17 and C5s and airdrop or insert everything in less than 12 hours like we can today.

The logistical challenges the USA faced far exceeded that of the German army.  The tonnage of cargo and personnel movement world record, from WWII, stood until 2007-2008 when the record was broken at Balad/Anaconda in Iraq.   And it took modern cargo aircraft to accomplish that record breaking.  (armored humvees and MRAPS also weigh a good deal more than a shitty jeep)

So to imply that the USA didn't really do shit in WWII is flatly ignorant.    




 Pretty sure I spent more than a few summers at Camp Failhard.    









 Peaked in highschool.   




 Look at that shit eating grin.  

 




 Fair point.  

Lost Boys just retained a cult following.  His other films, not so much.    




 can one serial kill oneself?  




 I mean I'm okay with the Matrix.  Not because of keanu or anything.  

I generally avoid his movies.  Except I do like Johnny Mnemonic for no good reason at all. I know it's a really shitty movie but for some reason I like it. Nostalgia maybe idk.   

I remember being forced to watch ~~The Notebook~~ edit: I mean the lakehouse or whatever that shit with sandra bullock.  I can't even remember the name lol.  I just remember wondering how many times they were gonna use a turtleneck to cover up his ugly neck.   He is not aging gracefully at all.    




 He knows... he knows ALL about it.   




 No shit sherlock.  Thanks for unloading all that know-it-all on us over a figure of speech.    




 Who you gonna call??  




 Granted: edited.  

Critical thought now:
Did he kill people in The Cable Guy?  




 Let the shitposting roll.  idc.  

edit:downvote this post.   




 Don't worry, buckets can hold tears and brain matter at the same time.

heh heh heheh 

but they have no brains...


Oooooooooooo    




 Edit: He found it. I'm good.   




 People in the media generally dismiss college campus numbers.   




 There was "The Client".

I fell asleep to it.  He made that in 1994.  One of those courtcase movies that never fucking end it seems like.   

And then Phone Booth.... never heard of it.   




 No... because some states will reject corporations money and not ratify.  The political climate in the individual states isn't so easily bought if you are asking for something they are fundamentally against.  It doesn't matter how many billions you have.

Ratification process serves us well here.  Whilst I don't think it is IMPOSSIBLE to buy the entire thing... it's not going to happen quietly.  The massive number of individuals that have to be bought here... it won't stay quiet for long.     

That is a conspiracy of massive proportions that would take mind control to pull off.     




 I don't think your assertion of his "character" can be substantiated in his roles.  He's done so many different things and none of that has really stepped on the toes of his other parts.  

Man on the Moon for better or worse did not feel like I was watching Ace Ventura or the Mask.   

So I think he has the ability to both embrace and transcend his stereotypical image for each of his roles.    




 Still not horror. 




 Well let's be honest. Joel Schumacher has never really lived up to The Lost Boys.  Batman and Robin was terrible.  He hasn't really done anything that memorable.  He's not a bad director, just a tad overrated.   

The director would have to be someone who wouldn't hold back.  But it looks like Jim Carrey won't go that road anymore.  

The story behind 23 seems... weak. 

Edit: I would argue to Carrey that dark psychological ~~drama~~"thriller" =/= pure horror film.    




 That was a comedy.   




 Yeah but their personalities are way different than each other... 

Robin Williams would play a more loathing depressed type of killer that uses the murder to soothe internal pain.  

Carrey would be a more antagonstic or playful killer just out for the sick pleasure.  with some amount of loathing to go along with it.    




 Agree or disagree idc.  

He'd be creepy and dark as fuck....  

Edit: And I don't mean a thriller or black comedy.  I mean make it Horror.   

Edit2: Turning off inbox replies.  WTF happened last night?  I barely remember posting this. San Migel Pale Pilson is shit beer.  And I hate Jim Carrey.  I apologize for my behavior in bringing this up.    This is like waking up to discover that last night you were the, so-drunk-it's-awkward-guy, ruining the party.    




 Looks like I picked the wrong day to stop sniffing glue.  




 I just finished reading through this series for the 3rd time.  But previous two times was back c 2007 and 08.    

I got to thinking if this could be made into a movie... I don't know.  It'd be a LONG fucking movie I'd think.    

Netflix series??? I'm not sure the intensity of the environment would work over tons of episodes?  If it's TOO campy it won't work I think.   

Disclaimer: Ignore the fact that there isn't an actor alive that would not turn Spider into a clown.     




 I don't know... I've always been resistant to these guys jumping back and forth into each other's storylines.  It takes away some of the uniqueness of the hero within his own world.  

 




 No way... that's TOTALLY a weather balloon.  /s 


Nice pic.  Set as wallpaper and done.   THNX!  




 How fucking childish is that shit.  You know... some of the South Korean people still have family trapped inside. 

"**YES SUFFER HARDER SO THAT YOUR TEARS HAVE A MORE GENUINE FLAVOR WHILE YOU PITIFULLY BEG FOR MERCY!"**

And the usa is all 

"huh hhuh uh here's a stick... poke em with it huh huhuhuh. .  that's cool.  They deserve it. Commies"   

Kim Jung-Un will eventually say please.  But in a long drawn out way before he pushes the launch button.   "Puhleeaasseee"  **CLACK!**  (his launch button has a 3 foot diameter probably)

Europe just thinks if you don't look at it then it will go away.  

China is like a parent that is embarrassed by it's special needs child.    

Russia doesn't give a shit unless it makes the USA look bad then they just play blah blah blah lip service to it....  

Japan is aching to be let out of it's cage.   Until then it just gets to bolster it's "defensive force" and play the victim. (we won't talk about how their short lived conquests are what originally caused all this shit to happen.  NEW FLAG; DIDN'T HAPPEN TEEHEE! )  

The USA just likes to punch shit; so that didn't really heal any of the wounds that Old Japan left behind.   

When shit finally hits the fan with this stupid ass nonsense, everyone is going to wish we had done something different.  Because it's gonna be messy for South Korea and the rest of Asia; as USA and China can't play nice on the water.    




  Someone get the detroit webmaster to put down the crackpipe and reboot the server!     




 Quick! Flip him over and check to see if there's hair on the other end!  




 The first post has the link to the studies bro.   

How many times you gotta be told?   




 Yes... based on the studies... IN GENERAL organics are loaded with parasites when compared to non organics.  

For example,  2 buckets of produce.  Organic and Non Organic.   If the organic has as much as 31% more parasites than the non organic then it was taken on a load of parasites.   LOL    


I stand by that.  

Now please show me where I said 100 percent have parasites?  You can't Because I never said that.  And there are links to the sourced material.... So fuck off.  I'm turning off inbox replies to prevent further feeding of shitposting trolls.  

 




 Please quote me where I said 100% of organic produce has parasites....  

You can't.  Stop shitposting.  Troll. 


Edit:  Yes.... in the first post I link to the comment that has multiple sources already linked.    Did you even fucking read... or check?    




 This is true.  You should wash everything.  

However, the studies were comparing organics to non organics.  Whole Foods is an organic grocery, no? 

It is fair to note, that my opening sentence was "Wash your veggies" but then spoke specifically to the type of organic product of Whole Foods and how you should be MORE vigilant.  Perhaps wash those organic veggies extra due to the increased risk.   

I mean... feel free to simplify an entire post, to a single, out of context quote....

 




 The Moon is a Harsh Mistress talks a bit about this; the problem was people assigned to work on Luna ended up turning into a life sentence if they stayed too long.   




 Holy crap someone asked how these magnets work and got a legitimate answer.    




 Can I borrow your nuclear powered realdoll?    




 Why not?   




 The president is a tax paying citizen like the rest of us though.    
 




 The president is a tax paying citizen like the rest of us.  That means he owns it.   Yes, it is his house.  It's my house too.   

Mi casa su casa.

And we've referred to it as the presidents house for a while.  "The Bush White House"  "The Clinton White House".  

Obama isn't bob dole.  He doesn't need to refer to himself in the third person so he could say "My White House".... But yeah... he lives there.  

You don't own your apartment no matter if it's free or not.  But you still call it "my apartment".    




 Are you like a.... mental ninja?  Or shaman?   My heart feels soothed by this. 




 Fill the middle with thickly mixed acrylic and you have a delicious snack!  


"Did you eat paint cannolis as a kid??"

 




 So wash your veggies.  Organic vegetables are loaded with parasites.  And people catch Listeria from unwashed produced because the pickers and handlers can't figure out how to wash their hands after pooping on them and farmers keep irrigating their fields with water washed down from the pig farms....

As /u/gothic_potato so generously sourced actual studies, [in his post here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/3aobr2/a_guy_with_food_poisoning_from_sushi_threw_this/cseu1ee)  

If you're not washing your veggies YOU ARE AN IDIOT THAT DESERVES TO GET SICK.  

ehem.  I'm better now thank you.   

Edit:  On a side note you can ask the cashier to verify the weight on their scale.  But meat departments really should start providing scales to double check. 




 This is true but rabbits also have a hard time drinking liquid water.  They get much of their mosture off the dew covering the grasses they eat.   

So grapes aren't a good thing to feed everyday, They are probably perfect for a lost and probably hungry and dehydrated rabbit.   It's just okay for a first feeding to give it some needed sugars and water.  I would suggest taking the skin off the grapes if the rabbit isn't spitting them out.      

But after some rest you should give it something better suited to it's daily nutritional needs.  
 




 The problem with "buying a law" is that the public is more aware and savvy to these types of events.  And when someone is raking in big money from corporations it's beginning to hurt them more than helping. 

Corporations can buy individual votes... but the ratification process is not so simple as each state's political climate is different.   

That ratification process is what protects the people.   




 Yeah I read your link and spoke specifically on it.  It's 3 almost 4 years old and it was using data collected from the global financial collapse and still during the adjustment period of the recent passage.    

Volume of trading between the two markets isn't even CLOSE to the same.  Neither is how the trading is done.  The GDP of the two countries isn't even remotely similar and neither are the rest of their economic policies or political systems.      

Your USA=Sweden premise is still wrong and unproven.  Try again.  




 Well, fortunately amendments have to be ratified by the states.  So... it's a lot harder for a corporation to buy an amendment than it is to buy a federal law.    




 Because it is a false premise from the very damn start of critical analysis.  If USA = Sweden then we would be located in the exact same location with the exact same system of government with the exact same market laws and regulations.  same leaders population  and same name.   


But since these are obviously not true then yes it is quite incontrovertible that USA and Sweden are NOT the same.   

You said they are contrary to irrefutable fact.  Therefore it is up to You to prove that Sweden and the USA are exactly the same.

And your sources are old as ducks utilizing data from the global recession..... 




 Just throw sheep at the invaders and they'll eventually tire of it and leave.   

 




 No bill of rights??? How do they keep the government from stomping on people's faces?  




 They did that so that we might more carefully consider the treaties we agree to let have power over us.  Giving up control was suppossed to act as a deterrent against shitty treaties.  

That has backfired.  It's time to make amendments to the Constitution to work in today's world.  This isn't 1776 anymore...   




 Upon confronting the victim, one must convince them to sit completely still so that the victim can present a precise location of an area no larger than 1/4 an inch.  The attacker will carefully line up the attack utilizing only their index and middle fingers to jam swiftly, forcefully, and deeply into an area penetrating the area between the  pyramid and the inferior cerebellar peduncle.  


If the victim tenses up and this area cannot be punctured the attacker will then say "Wait" and try again.  If continued flinching persists in disrupting a precise hit the attacker can eventually tell the victim to "hang on 1 sec" whilst they pull out their knife and just access the nerve through the jugular foramen or possibly through the carotid sheath were it lies between the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein.  

The attacker must be careful not to nick either of these blood transporting structures, as doing so might cause imminent death; thereby interfering with the process of achieving death by disruption of the bundled pair of vagus nerves.    




 We need an open world WWII game.... 

And these games should feature characters like these to tell their stories.  It would be wicked cool and educational at the same time.   
 




 I thought the standard was: Are the packages they are handling arrive at their destination in a timely manner for a cheap price.  

Fuck yes is the answer to that.  USPS transit times comparable to fedex and UPS slowest cheapest way but yet still costs less money.   

The fact that no one else is delivering leaf mail has absolutely ZERO to do with how well USPS has been performing their job.  I can mail a letter from one coast to the next for less than a buck.  USPS promises it will arrive in 7 to 10 days... it arrives in 3.   

You can't fucking beat that.  So .... shhhh.  you don't know what you're talking about.   

I was in a military unit that broke the global world record for tonnage of cargo and personnel moved in 2008.   That record still stands today.    So I know a little something about logistics.... And the USPS is shit hot when it comes to logistics.    




 Again, did **I** do that to **YOU**??  

A native american man was going around raping people.  Do I blame all native americans for that? 


How about all the crime that Native Americans commit against other Native Americans.... do you hate all native americans right now?  Or is his crime against his own race still really the fault of whites?  

What about the chinese railroad workers that used to murder the native american competition in their sleep?  Do you hate chinese now?   Will you cut one of them if they walk onto a reservation?   What about a mexican?  Mexicans are half white and half native in general.   Would you cut a mexican?  He's half to blame! 


Apparently being full of shit applies to ANY race. 


And I got news for you, the native americans were waring, brutalizing, enslaving, murdering, raping, scalping, raiding, and eating each other LONG LONG before whites ever got here.  I suppose you think they were really all just sitting around in their teepee's smoking peacepipes and playing flutes huh?   They never ever fought or attacked others. *cough PAWNEE cough*   Oh and the Comanche tribe used to hunt down other tribes, kill their babies over a fire and then eat their cooked flesh.   How about a Comanche?  will you cut him?     

You hate all native americans double or triple now?     




 **HE** gave it to **YOU**????? 

This isn't news?? 

Edit: Holy fuck you'd expect this sort of thing happened hundreds of years ago between peoples that are already dead!  But its happening RIGHT NOW!     

I'm sorry, but I don't take blame for the failings of dead people who died hundreds of years before I was born.  My european family line wasn't even in the USA at that time.  (oh and my great grandmother was full cherokee).  Which doesn't mean shit because i'm mostly white.  So much so you can't tell there is any native american genes in my dna.     

So does that mean I get like 75% blame and get to claim 25% victim?  (or whatever the percentage is for that generational spread)

Please.  Use your head and apply some critical thought to the embarrassing shit you think before you just barf it out and look like a fool some more. 




 She has the look of "I just pooped my pants in public." 




 Well I guess I can officially call myself a 2nd Amendment Socialist.   

Thanks. 




 No no... that's not how this works.  That is not my responsibility.  YOU made the comparison.   It's up to YOU to show how they are the same.  This Sweden=USA is your premise not mine.  Why should I care enough to fix something you broke?  Don't slack off, do your own job, and quit asking me to fling myself willingly into your trap.  I won't be suckered into fruitless debates by dogma and false premises.             




 Your making the comparison on the false premise that Sweden's and the USA's economies and markets are the same.  They are not.  




 This....   THIS....  


I owe you a life debt.   My whole life.. and then you... here.  THIS!   BOOM.   

NO MORE WILL I NOT HAVE MY CHIPS OR MY 75 CENTS!!!!!   




 It would hurt... at first.  But all growth comes with pains and investment. 

But you're a fool if you don't invest for the long term.  It's the END GAME that counts.   And in the end, a better educated society that leads the world will be better for the stock market.  

And it really would not hurt that bad.  Do you know how much fucking microtransactions take place in a single second?  This tax would suck for all of 3 months and then it'd just be part of the game.    




 ...which would benefit from a better educated and more pro$perou$ $ociety. 




 TIL: I look and sound like Lewis Black when stuck in traffic.    




 My laughter turned to tears... and not the kind commonly associated with extreme humor.    




 Still needs to ask a vet about it.  Because the cat may have barfed up most of the medicine and there could be more worms further down the intestinal tract.  Vet can advise when the dose again and how much it do additional testing. 




 I'm calling bullshit!  That's clearly a tribble.   




 Explain to me how to walk.    




 I was white in New Orleans inner city school before moving to Atlanta.  

In New Orleans school, there was no separation of students at lunch.  I was a minority and had nicknames like "whitey" "white bread" and "saltine".   I didn't really care because it was in good fun and these were my friends.  Friends that had my back and I had their's.  Which was damn important in New Orleans.  The other whites just sat mixed in with the blacks.  Salt and Pepper.  1 to 5 ratio if I had to guess. 


Then, I moved to Atlanta.  My first day at school, I get lunch and I sit down at the nearest open seat.  I had not yet noticed that all the students were divided.  White kids on one side and the black kids on the other.   

Anyway.  I sat down at what happened to be the blacks table.   Well the black kids started harassing me, pushing me out of my chair, and told me to get back over to the side of the cafeteria; where "my kind" were to sit.   


Now I didn't know what the fuck was going on.   At all.  Goddamn mars this fucking place.  Then I noticed the division.  Having no allies on my first day, naturally I retreat to the white kids' side of the cafeteria; where I had been unanimously told to go, by a large group of very upset students.   And I wasn't accepted there, with the whites, either.  The kids then called me a "wigger" and nicknamed me "white men can't jump" as that movie was popular at the time. White men can't jump was my name for the next 3 years before I moved again.   That was, by far, the dumbest 3 years of my entire existence.  Fuck Atlanta.  Honestly FUCK Atlanta.  

I'm not saying anything at all about this story in relation to the struggle of racism in the USA.  I'm not sure what it means, to be honest.  I'm not going to deny that I would not want the challenges a black man continues to face today.  I do my best not to compound the problems, that other races have, by simply treating them how I would want to be treated.  It's their own fault if they are dicks after that.  And being a dick has nothing to do with skin. 

I've been all over the world and I'll tell you this: People are people and they are generally the same everywhere you go. And one thing that always seems to stay true, no matter where I am in the world, is that a vocal and powerful shitty few fuck everything up for the silent majority.   

 I've never really formed an opinion other than this was an unfortunate situation.   And it taught me to have an open mind... but to also have open eyes to go along with that open mind.    
 




 I'm impotent.  Have sympathy.    




 I agree.   It was something that I saw them talking about on the "news" here in Phillipines... Which is just opinion blabbing just like USA news.   

They were talking about bringing Netflix to the Philippines and discussing how they could possibly make a subscription service work in a poor cash driven society.   The subject of ads came up.   So I asked here wondering what Americans thought.  I suspected it would be against it but I wanted to see if anyone would bring up the "revenue generation" arguments or "incentivizing production of more shows" that was getting thrown around during the segment.     

On a side note: I like how many people are participating and then downvoting the question.   Isn't the vote not supposed to be about agreement or disagreement?   Geeze people, Sorry it's not a *Plumbers of reddit, whats the biggest turd you wrangled at your job* question. 
























 Typing is hard when the disconnected top half of your head just flops around when you talk.   









 LOL "No dude.. I don't want them to tell me what she did... I just want them to tell me what she did."  

its a dumbass a minute here in /r/news....    




 Too stupid for that realization to have a positive effect on choices.   




 The question is based off false premise.  I will not be suckered into a dogma trap.   *The debate was about the misrepresentation of the Cuban program and the difference between what Americans think "quarantine" is vs. what it ACTUALLY is.*   That's it.

Your further echoing of the misconceptions is proof that people don't have a fucking clue about what the program actually was or is.  Instead, you try and sucker the debate into, "should we or shouldn't we do this in the USA".... when ironically, we do a LOT WORSE in the USA where we criminalize and punish medical problems.  When on the contrary, this internationally participated cuban program did nothing oppressive and instead lifted people up.   

So you can try to obfuscate with hypotheticals all you want but THE REALITY of the situation is that no one was oppressed or punished or abused, harmed, or had a gun pointed in their face.   They didn't round up masses of people who had or were accused of having AIDS.  They simply said, "Come to our clinics, get tested, and if positive we will enroll you into this medical program.   No one marched anyone into those government offices with a goddamn gun. And the public saw how well it was working out for people with a disease that kills millions, that people who got AIDS happily walked into the office and got the care they needed.   

I deal in facts... not made up situations and dishonest ignorance.   

"What if the cuban government used guns?"  

"They didn't" 

"no dude but what if.... you know it's CUBA" 

"Ok but they didn't need to use guns because the patients came to them on their own free will"  

"Yeah but if they didn't want to... cuba guns!" 


They don't use guns because the people who don't want to participate simply don't get tested in the government clinic.    But who'd not want all that sweet medical care to make sure this death sentence doesn't kill them?   No one.   Which is why it worked and why they don't needs guns, didn't use guns, and had no plans on ever using guns to enforce the law.    

*Laws don't need guns if they actually help people.  Because there is already huge incentive to follow the law if it benefits you in some way.*   

But who could blame you, you're so used to living under "You can't you can't you can't" USA laws.

 The issue of the debate is the misrepresentation of what this Cuba program was.  And how people see the word "quarantine" and they equate it with punishment and abuse.  Americans are so used to punishement being apart of the system that they think it is apart of every system.  It has nothing to do with the USA treating medical needs as criminal acts.  (which is far worse than what cuba is doing with this program). The USA practice of criminalizing and punishing medical problems displays a reality that is... well... sickeningly ironic.  Yet you just keep blabbing about "its criminal".   Which supports my point.   

But to clarify: This isn't about that.... this debate was about what this cuba program REALLY was, and how ignorant people don't have a fucking clue what "quarantine" is in real life.  


The only thing most of them know about what "quarantine" is, is a hollywood misrepresentation. And this debate proves that because people keep arguing from the false premise that AIDS patients were being punished and that quarantine=punishment.  


This is the same misrepresentation that you keep echoing here.   I can abide ignorance... but willful ignorance.  That just makes me sick to my stomach.  I'd feel sorry for you if I didn't feel like barfing right now.  

I'm  done here.   




 I hindsight it was Andy Kaufman humor I think.   It's funny because it's so very not funny.... 


I never liked andy. 




 The only thing insulting here is your direct misrepresentation of what this program was and your ignorance behind what quarantine actually is.  But hey, I guess I can't blame you because you've succumbed to accepting that everything in this world is centered around punishment; like many in the USA have.

Good luck being willfully ignorant.  It's so bad it's almost dishonest. 




 What?   The government wasn't involved. In either case of Cuba or the usa.   

Cuba had 2 other international groups involved and the USA the government clinics were the main group trying to help whilst the private institutions fucked over patients.   We're you even alive during this time?  

Edit: the discussion was about the misrepresentation of the Cuba program and not if we should do it in the USA or not.  Which we do...  but that's another can of worms.   

 




 ^good ^story. 




 Yeah, no guns were used.  You know there were 2 other international groups involved with this right?   I'm just going to put you on ignore because you're a fucking obfuscating moron.  And you don't even know enough about the issue to discuss it properly.   Gotta be trollolololing all the the way to trollololol land.   




 Oh okay so in the USA we treat people with a disease as criminals and lock them up in shitty rehab facilities that don't really help them. 

Cuba took people with a disease that kills millions upon millions, and is scary as fuck... they take them and care for them, and help with with mental health, with medicine, with education and the results were fantastic.

Oh but because some men with guns MIGHT show up (we don't know that they would) it's all bad.  

I'm done replying to you now.  You're ridiculous.    




 Well let see... that never happened so apparently what they are doing is working for them.   

The point is people are making shit up and misrepresenting the facts.  Whilst ignoring that we do a LOT worse in the USA.    




 They send a mental health professional to convince you to go.  SO you do. 




 The funny thing is, that the program was so great that no one ever had to use guns.  The patients were glad to go! So I guess we'll never know if they would use guns or not. 

 How naive you must be to think that's not the case.

But that isn't the case... you just made it up.  No guns were used or need to be used because people go so willingly because it takes good care of them.   LOL.   Just make shit up and claim people are naive for not agreeing with it.  

 




 No no....We were discussing purely what cuba did and how he misrepresented it.  

No one is talking about doing this in the USA.  

The issue was, that he was making it out to be some kind of brutal men with guns quarantine, when it was absolutely NOTHING like that. 

And again... the USA quarantines drug abusers all the time.    




 Fair point.  However, I have to point out that those diseases didn't come with irrational fear (because ignorance), and they also didn't come with a social stigma attached.  If you had AIDS, it automatically meant you were a homosexual and/or drug abuser.  Did anyone stop to think that you weren't either of those two things and that you might have simply caught it from having sex with monkeys?   

I joke, but that's what it was like for sufferers during the late 80s and most of the 90s.   It's a joke and it's not fucking funny; but it was the sophomoric reality that people with AIDS had to deal with. 

No one with diabetes had to face that kind of stupidity or scrutiny.       

Aside from STDs, no other disease really comes with that stigma. The medical community based a lot of its initial reaction to the AIDS crisis on irrational fears rather than science.  The medical community didn't really know what to do and AIDS was scary as fuck.  
 




 Good thing that isn't what is happening here.   




 I'm not talking about white guys who claim to be rasta.  I'm talking about the core of the religion in Jamaica... it isn't welcoming to whites.  It doesn't regard whites as evil.  [It regards blacks as superior and they will eventually rule the world.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/beliefs/black.shtml)  

These ideas were developed in part by [Marcus Garvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Garvey), who is considered a prophet by many rastafarians.   

These white dudes in the USA just claim to be rasta because some marijuana is used in some rituals and they think it gives them the freedom to get stoned.  

We will see fewer and fewer white dudes resorting to these measures as marijuana becomes legal.  There's no reason for the act anymore.... as if a judge would actually buy the "religious freedom" shit about white rastafarians smoking dope at a Big Day Out concert.  

 




 ok then.  I guess i don't mind then.    




 The alcohol religion already exists.  Catholics consume shitloads of wine.    




 Isn't the Rastafarian church prohibitive towards whites in general?   




 I love this verse.   Cannabis was used as medicine and relaxation during the bible times.  

"For so the Lord said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest."  Isaiah ch18 v 4   

Isaiah went home to relax and smoke some weed.  God told him to do it.

Edit:  In the next verse he goes on to talk about how and when to properly harvest the purple sticky punch.  

*"5 For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches."* Isaiah 18v5   

So he tells us when to get the PRIMO nugs.   Which is when they are about the size of grapes... as they would have been before modern genetic strains.   The buds would be purple or green and have a sour smell.  And you cut away the branches so they don't dry out and pull water from the buds.

 The USA was terrible in its treatment of AIDs patients until about 2000... even then, people could not afford treatment and were forced to utilize the free clinics.   Which did nothing for the patient but send them back on the street with a script for medicine they couldn't afford.  


You keep insinuating that men with guns shipped people off.... they didn't.   This is no different than a government mandating that drug users be quarantined to locked down rehabilitation institutions. 
 
Oh But because **"Cuba"** this program HAD to be brutal, with crying people screaming with outstretched arms and spread fingers, as they are stripped from their loved ones, and thrown in the back of a some wagon and hauled away For e Ver..

Get real....


   

 




 Your ignorance about what quarantine actually is, is astounding.    

You sound like you think quarantine is like what they show on television.... It's not.

Edit: you need to go fucking read about the "quarantine"  of these patients and how they were treated.  They were well provided for and many volunteered go stay longer than the mandatory treatment.   They weren't mistreated in any way  and most of the patients expressed how happy they were to have the service.   

They considered what they received as a gift.   Yet you keep acting like they were terribly treated and stuck in some prison dungeon somewhere.   Lol gtfo with that nonsense.

In many developed nations the patient is just sent to deal on their own and rot to death in ignorance.

 Yeah this " evolution" has worked out great for the middle class, has it not? 




 OK they weren't locked up in a torture chamber Hollywood depiction quarantine.....   they were very comfortable and received mental health care, medicine, and education about their disease.  

The headline made it seem like men with guns were taking people against their will and locking them away in torture chambers forever.  


They were not. And most of the patients were happy about it when it was over.  

Yet people like you keep acting like it was E.T. or outbreak or a zombie movie....  




 A service based economy, which is essentially economy based on doing each other's laundry, may create jobs but does not create wealth.

 Yes!  It's because the only gay they are exposed to are the perverts running around naked and doing lude things at the gay pride parade.

 Exactly.  It doesn't matter if a quote contradicts the outcome.... 

That's more like real life.  In reality we've got lots of good quotes from real people that contradicts with the condition of our world.

 I think it's a testament to his ability to write a dynamic story.   Not every character was the same or delivered the same message.

So the quote doesn't really contradict the overall events or outcome of the story.

 AIDs is nothing like those other diseases you mentioned so we can just scrap that part of the discussion into the false premise can.   


Who's advocating we lock people up into torture centers? 

NO ONE.   


But you can send people to a comfortable place, where they can be educated about their new disease, given medicine to prolong their health, and receive an endless number of benefits.   As we are seeing, these types of programs are working and the patients themselves are taking value in them.   

Who the fuck here has advocated that we lock anyone into a torture chamber where they receive no care and are victimized?   

NOT A SINGLE FUCKING PERSON.  

You're right... it's DEFINITELY a dumbass a minute right now.    Fucking acting like people are saying we should lock people up in hollywood's idea of quarantine, never to be released.   Pllllzzzzz.... gtfo with that nonsense LOL  




 Without a doubt, there should be no choice about quarantine when it comes to contagious diseases like Ebola.   

That being said these types of diseases, while super fast acting, sort of snuff themselves out easier.  

AIDs kills far more people than Ebola, BECAUSE it is so quiet and slow.  It has the opportunity to spread to more people because of it's silence.    

So I'd argue that educational quarantine for new infections is of extreme importance.  Not only is the first 5 years of the disease a crucial treatment period and the victim should be educated about that, but we can also teach some much needed knowledge about what practices are safe and which are not in, in regards to transmitting the disease to others.  

Thus, we can help negate some of the exposure to the disease that this virus has gained through ignorance coupled with it's stealthy nature.   

Ebola is the crazy loud shooting spree type killer whilst AIDs is the quiet serial killer.

 Fucking awesome this second link.   I can just make my own and not even have to purchase the erasers.  I'm sure I can tweak the recipe for better performance.  I'm very picky about my erasers.  can't be too hard or too soft.  

This means I can buy my daughter a snack to go along with her trips to the Hand On museum.  And I can keep doing as much art as I want.  

I... I didn't get YOU anything.    




 You are proof of my original assertion that people don't have a clue what quarantine means or how it helps people.  Too bad ignorance is not something we can quarantine for...but I guess ignorance is just the quarantine of your mind from reality.  SO....  

Good luck to you, friend.   




 meh... Cuba isn't half as bad as china.   China really does suck.   Ive been living in asia for over a year.  China does a lot of shit that never makes the news in the usa it seems.    

China sucks, fuck china. 




 After finding out such emotional news, I'd certainly want to be more grounded in science and logic.  That could be soothing to the fear, to be able to hear the science behind it, the treatment, to hear that death is not necessarily knocking on the door.   

What such a life changing event needs is rational objectivity.  Not more drama.   




 Until you realized clenching caused the cuts to bleed, soothing the pain and enabling you to continue angrily clenching your fists until blood drips from them. 




 Which blood would help to soothe. 

I always squeeze my papercuts until they bleed.  Then there is no pain and I don't get the ridiculous talking mouth on fingertip problem.    




 The quarantine might actually benefit the patient.   When Americans hear the word "quarantine" it seems like they think of E.T. and Outbreak... and all the zombie movies.   

But "quarantine" doesn't automatically mean the patient gets shipped off to brutal torture institutes.  

And the first 3 or 4 weeks of being diagnosed you're not gonna want to be sitting around your mother nagging over "You shoulda used a condom... how many times did I tell you to use clean needles.... if you weren't having butt sex this wouldn't happen... blah blah blah"    




 I've tried that before.  The clumps always just fall out of it eventually.  I haven't had a lot of luck.   I also don't like those soft "ticky-tack" erasers for graphite because they don't perform the same each time and end up laying down more mark than they lift off.    




 I do a ton of art, mostly charcoal but I do a ton of sketch work, with graphite, before going to charcoal.  

This is where I work out mistakes...  and I'm not a very good artist so I have to fix, and fix, and fix, until it's right.   I don't just draw it all expert like as I see on Youtube.   

So that leaves me with all these bits and chunks of erasers, that are each too small to use individually, but when piled together would make a very large eraser.   

I store them in a small paint can that I dump out when it gets full.  


How do I stick these guys together?   Can they be melted and remolded?  If I can reclaim these erasers, I'll save at least $14.75 a month; which means I'll have enough to take my daughter to her favorite Hands-on Museum each weekend.   




 seems dumb, to administer a medication to people, without even doing a physical first; let alone consult with a doctor at all.      

 




 I'm *TRYING*!

Yes....  I'm saying the farmers are collecting WAY MORE than 23 gallons per cow.   They've got hundreds or thousands of gallons that evaporate each day in their pointless retention ponds that sit out in the sun all day.  I've driven by to see them keep the retention ponds full in bare fields they aren't using for cattle at the time.  

At least if the cow drank it or it was used to grow alfalfa then it was USED for SOMETHING.    


Just leaving it to evaporate out of some hole in the desert means the water was lost for NOTHING.     




 The word should have been caucus but... autoincorrect.   

Should have read "As a VP she is useless to our caucus."   




 Right.  We need a revolution at the polls.  90% turnout or this isn't going to work.   And even then it will be hard.   Some districts don't even field two candidates because the new gerrymandered district is nearly 100% one party.   So they get seats no matter what happens at the polls.   

At least we could hope for super majorities.    




 I actually, on several posts, already made the point that one should not see the reboot if they are the purist mentality.  

I simply conveyed The Purist's way of thinking.  At no point did I endorse or condone it.   

Chillax.

 When I was a kid, we had a Shih Tzu, named Ting Su (racist?) that used to hunt down chocolate.  She'd never touch any food within reach, but leave a Hershey kiss within reach and it was gone; it's existence to be memorialized as shredded bits of foil in the grass.

One Christmas, we were unaware that she had consumed a family sized bag of holiday mint M Ms.  

Ting Su knew the candies were hidden inside the wrapped gift the moment my grandmothers bulging knuckled hands placed it upon the carpet of needles beneath the dry as fuck Christmas tree.  Those acidic smelling needles, that would take weeks of vacuuming to remove, did nothing to hide the existence of those sweet smelling chocolates.  Ting Su's nose was ninja.  A ninja with a stupid cloth antler collar on.   

She waited until everyone left.  She knew what she was doing was wrong.  And she knew we would find her mess upon our return.   She carefully picked up the gift, as if it were one of the many puppies of the numerous litters she raised.  She quickly skulked down the hallway to the last door on the right.  She quickly ducked underneath the bed; where she would be hidden by the flowery bed-skirt and boulders of dust bunnies.  Her sharp teeth make quick work of all impeding packaging and she was rewarded with her 16 oz prize.  

She played it cool upon our return.  No one knew of her misdeeds.   She was a "good girl," "a pretty dog," and strange sounds whilst human places mouth on top of head. 

For me, nothing seemed amiss.  She laid her head gently in my small lap.  I really wasn't prepared for the traumatic event that was about to occur. I pulled her limp head up so I could see into her dark black eyes.  Those ebony globes ordinarily full of love had a different quality to them.  

I moved in closer for a better look and then it happened.   Her body made a jerk.  A huge lurching occurred.  And time then became so very slow.  There was little I could do as I saw it coming.  Bathed in the warm light of the christmas lights, who's setting was not permitted to be changed from "slow glow", I saw the shimmering splash of red, green, white, and mostly brown geyser forth out of Ting Su.   The entire mass of liquid reflected the joyful decorations of the season as it moved ever closer to the center of my face.  

And that's it.  She just wagged her tail and played with her toys for the rest of the evening.   Every year people give me those damn M Ms as a gag gift.   I can't even smell them.  YUCK.  


She didn't die from chocolate. She lived to be 19 years old. She passed in her sleep a few weeks after her daughter died of old age.

 Maybe to you... 

When I was in Iraq, I'd visit those memories before falling to sleep.  If only to dream of those places rather than the deadly hell I was in at the time.   

That being said... if someone is a purist about recalling a movie... they just shouldn't see a reboot.   

however, I don't think the conclusion is: your childhood memories aren't that important.   

it's those memories and experiences that make each of us who we are.   So Yeah... seems like thats pretty important.    




 To be fair... I don't prepare my food in the bottom of a dirty sink.  


Nor do I leave the sink all filthy and nasty after washing the cat there.  

Cleaning is possible.  We've got lots of tools to help us with that.   




 How exactly is a rainbow made?    




 Yes. I bathe them in the sink because it's easier and safer than the bathtub.   You see that you quoted me saying I bathe them there?   




 Right because people still care about how much their gas bill is going to be.....  




 Evil cosmetic companies testing their product on helpless animals... 




 Thin Mints are messy as fuck in Iraq. 




 Why?  I've had lots of cats and have trained them all to stay off the kitchen counters and kitchen table.   

It's not hard.  It takes like 3-7 days of conditioning and then it's fine.   

The trick is to make sure they have a high place they are allowed to jump on that belongs to them.  That makes the other training go a lot smoother.   

I don't even feed the cat in the kitchen or open it's food there.   They have their own spot and I keep their food stored near by. 

Another mistake people make is storing the litter box in the laundry room or pantry in their kitchen.   BIG NO NO.   Then they wonder why their cat pisses on clean laundry.   BECAUSE IT SMELLS LIKE THE PLACE THEY ASSOCIATE WITH PISSING!  Derps.  

My cats never have a reason to go in the kitchen.  They regard it as the place I force them to get wet when I bath them and thats it.   So they stay away.

Yes it's violent...but compared to what we are watching today, it's not THAT much more violent.  Not NC-17 worthy to say the least.    




 And the funny thing is... it really isn't THAT violent.   We have worse stuff on TV today.
