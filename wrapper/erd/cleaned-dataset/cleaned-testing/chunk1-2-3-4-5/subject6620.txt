 Best looking vehicle with a Subaru badge on it. I've got to go back to [this] (http://www.motorstown.com/imgs/18020-subaru-svx-2.html) in order to recall any other Subaru as visually stunning.  




 You should drop Mendenhall. There has got to be another way to fill that roster spot with someone that doesn't register 0 each week. Time to start scoring some points, man. 




 Being that you're in Chicago after all [unlawful intent can be presumed] (http://thefiringline.com/library/blades/knifelaws.html) 




 Not the most exciting roster spot to add, but consider the Cardinals D/ST. They shut down Vick and the Eagles weapons last week, and are going up against a struggling Miami offense. 




 Livable wages   fair medical benefits would be the first of a number of reasons. Unionized commercial food workers can make around $16-17 per hour for the jobs that Walmart workers get paid $9-10 an hour for.  




 The ice rink at Millennium Park would be a great option in late November. Zoo Lights in Lincoln Park = free. Ride the Ferris Wheel if the two of you aren't afraid to shiver a little.   




 Perhaps the Gangster Disciples near Division   Pulaski should consider moving to a more friendly community. So many of their neighbors are of the insane/maniacal variety. 




 Any game that the Hogs play against the Wolves will either be televised on Comcast or MY50 for Chicago locals. The way AHL's scheduling is structured that's probably 8-10 games this season 




 Sometimes stickers come in cow shapes and chicken shapes too. That's protein for ya!
 




 Perhaps Cutler could be more of a said bitch if he went to play for the Wings and remained a mediocre defenseman on their squad until he is 67 years old. 




 This has got to be one of the lesser liked Illinois or Cook County cops. They gave him a 2004 Malibu!

 I find it more offensive that the Canucks are #3. First, their logo can simply be classified as stupid. Additionally, the huge VANCOUVER letters are obnoxious. Lastly, they borrowed the color scheme from the 1990s Seahawks. #3? Seriously? 




 For most of the mid 90s until about 2006 these jerseys were about the only thing the Hawks had going for them.  




 What did the 911 call sound like?
 




 It's a bit crazy. I've thought about proposing some trades for depth. Trading away the guys that you drafted early makes no sense though. Why pick a RB/WR1 and not show the confidence to keep him on your roster? 




 Looked at the title too fast and thought "He bought steak at Giordano's!?" ...but hopefully this helps the owners get it together.  




 Guy is alone because of the Detroit Vipers jersey.

 Saddest moment in Berwyn history: http://chicagoist.com/2008/05/03/berwyn_spindle_1.php 




 Gone are the days when the Wolves were the only independent club in the IHL; I miss that. It's partly said "business" and partly the growing emphasis on the AHL being a developmental league. It seems that the number of veterans a club is allowed keeps shrinking. 

But with an impending lockout there is a great deal to be excited about this October! The roster will be stacked, and Wendell has brought Haydar and Sterling back together too.    




 I second this. The wolves are more of their own entity than most AHL teams. 

As far as the Ice Hogs go... thanks for Andrew Shaw. Nothing else positive to say about that organization. 




 Terrible luck!
 
If you go to Velasquez   Sons they can replace a catalytic converter way cheaper than most. It was 2006, but I got one for $90 parts and labor.  




 Even funnier is the ad box on the tribune's page: 

"Single? Meet local older women for free!"
 




 AHL gets no coverage in the states either. Chicago Wolves are the only team that televises all of their games, and it's local coverage only.  




 Way too much credit being given to Americans with this. This is assuming that they know of at least 10 countries in this region and can identify their shapes. 




 AHL during the last lockout was damn good. Guys like Vanek   Cammelleri ,that normally would have made NHL squads, played and tore things up. I remember watching my Wolves get destroyed in the finals by a team that featured Patrick Sharp, Jeff Carter, Mike Richards, Umberger, Nittamayki, and more.  




 Since it is a 2-way deal they should be able to. 

The circumstances were different in 2004-2005, but young NHL players like E.Staal and Spezza went down to the AHL after playing full seasons in the NHL. 




 Not over Sproles. Even though Sproles may get less than 10 carries, he has the potential to grab ~8 passes and rack up big yardage. Gerhart my get the same amount of touches, but his ceiling isn't nearly as high.  




 For a 10 team league this is terrible depth at RB.  




 Satisfyingly evil-looking.  




 Is it? Shouldn't it be "woman's best friend." Not "women's"
Nobody is saying "men's best friend." 




 So I'll refine my question and eliminate the loaded term "genocide." 

What is the proper historical legacy of Japanese war crimes (and crimes against humanity) that included: mass killings, human experimentation, biological warfare, and undeniable torture during the time period I mentioned?

How can we diminish the importance the potential lowest point humankind has ever reached. The actions of Japan during the 1930's and 1940's brought about what is perhaps the most widespread suffering the world has known.

 Wish I had been alive--or they would bring back--the NASL. Hockey fans would love it. MLS just is not that exciting. The NASL was able to lure big names like Pele and superstars from Europe. Plus they had probably the most intense post-regulation elimination shootouts.

 Or... keep it; instead of a 2 min penalty being assessed to the goalie, he becomes a skater who is allowed to handle the puck. However, being that he is outside the trapezoid/ goalie zone, the rules should allow for him to be bodychecked within the rules of checking any other puck-handling skater. I know my grandpa would love to see this, he suggests this every time he sees the damn trapezoid on tv.

 I guess you need to look at economic/social trends in Eastern Europe. I live in an area with a high population of new immigrants from Poland. BMWs, iphones, and flashy clothing is very ubiquitous among this group. (much different from my Polish relatives who came here ~100 years ago, who primarily came in a wave of lesser-skilled labor)

A number of the 21st Century immigrants are probably coming here for work because of their technical or specialized knowledge.

 I've been used to working 55 hrs a week for a while now. Draining work for sure, but I've got to imagine it's only about 4 months. 




 Thanks! This sounds a lot like what the job climate/ lifestyle is like for my uncle. I am definitely going to seek out his point of view as well. 




 Not incredibly random. I have a family member who is successful in the field, and have seen some of my college classmates transition into the professional field fairly soon after graduation.

It really takes a special kind of person to become an MD, and it really only pays more in the long run, considering that 4yrs of medical school + being an intern + the cost of school-related debt and malpractice insurance etc., etc., ...I cannot imagine that most MDs are making good money until they are past 30.  




 As is the case with many of us who are fresh graduates. Does an internship necessarily mean that you work for months in the field w/o getting paid? Already did an "internship" while student teaching, where I pretty much took over a classroom for 4 months, having to work nights and weekends w/o my university or cooperating school district knowing. Hoping not to get stuck in that situation at this point in my life.  




 Here is my situation: 24 y/o BA in Secondary Education; BA in History.

After two unsuccessful summers of not landing a full-time position as a history teacher, I am planning to do something more practical in place of the subject that I feel passionate about. The economic incentives of being a substitute teacher or a private school teacher are non-existent. I make more in my current position at a reading clinic/ my union weekend job.

From a purely practical/economic perspective, does it make sense for me to jump into a Masters of Science in Accounting program? 

It seems that the opportunities are more bountiful in this field, and if I strike out at landing a teaching job next year I'm probably going to give up anyway. Assuming that I can complete CPA certification, I probably can use a family connection to help me land a position in the accounting field. Just wanted to know if there is anything beneath the surface that would make it equally difficult for me in this field.

Thanks!

 Great start for Eddie Lack. This is his year to show that he has what it takes to play in the NHL. Anything less than an all-star nomination will be a disappointment.

 Pick up Richardson if possible. He fell an eyelash short of 100 yds yesterday and had just 13 touches (11 rushes, 2 catches). Plus, the Rams are probably going to part ways w/ SJax at the end of the year, so they will probably give him a good deal of work in the near future to see what he can do.

 **[ENTRY]** [Pontiac Fiero GT] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FIEROi2.jpg) Why? An American mid-engine two-seater from a defunct manufacturer that is made almost entirely of plastic and has a weird cargo section near the engine, no bonnet (hood), and still has a cult following. 

Get Clarkson in one of these, would love to see his reactions to it.  




 [This video] (http://www.empireofsoccer.com/flashback-vid-the-nasl-shootout-new-york-cosmos-v-washington-diplomats/) shows the intensity and suspense that were present in NASL shootouts. The league really had a few glory moments. Pele came to the New York Cosmos, and for a while fans were thrilled and passionate. 

I watched the movie "Once in a Lifetime" the story of the New York Cosmos, and it seemed like the league could have created a whole new soccer experience for Americans.

I wasn't alive to experience the NASL, so my question for those who were is this: Why did it fizzle out? 
 




 Soccer is and has always been my favorite sport, but I honestly hate matches that end in a draw. [The NASL concept] (http://www.empireofsoccer.com/flashback-vid-the-nasl-shootout-new-york-cosmos-v-washington-diplomats/) to end matches had to have been such a suspenseful and awesome experience for fans though. I just wish that this concept would have caught on on a bigger scale, because no true soccer fan likes watching matches decided on penalty kicks. 




 The tie is a dead concept in the NHL with the dawn of the shootout. 




 This kid was quite the sniper for the Rampage a few years back. Such an abrupt and unfortunate ending.

 Wayne. He's red hot and getting a plethora of targets. NYJ are not playing good defense at all.

 Hell yes. A truly International Hockey League? The old IHL (RIP 1945-2001) only had one team, Soviet Wings, outside of N.A. for just one season.   

This would open up so many opportunities to see different styles of play   really good players who never fit into the North American style of play.

 Considering that most of this car is made of plastic, and that V8 is sitting right in the middle of it, you've got a very quick little ride there. 

I cannot look at this too long though, it's making me sad. Why it had to end for Pontiac while soulless Buick keeps on living is a reality I do not want to accept. 




 Consider the Mazda 3. Consumer Report is saying that it is a great buy. The new "Skyactiv" engine gets the best fuel economy in its class and is actually more fuel-efficient than Mazda's subcompact Mazda 2. Additionally, the long-term costs are projected to be low considering the trends of the Mazda 3's build quality and reliability over the past few years. The price is not that much different than the Cruze or Focus either.

I wish i was in the market for one today. 
























 That block on the Forte run was responsible for 6 points as well, don't forget that!

 He WAS the reason why the Bears went 13-3 back in 2001. I remember more than one game-changing interception return from Brown during this season. Talk about a guy that brought such intensity every week, going all-out is why he had so many injuries, and when he would get injured you could see how much it frustrated him to be on the sidelines. We miss you, Mike Brown. '

Edit: Confirmed info: Brown had two walk-off interception returns for TDs during the 2001 season.

  Picking Charles at #7... I'm happy to say that I was able to do the same, shocking as it may be. 




 If I remember correctly, there was a model called the VL that was lower. It had a 2.0L instead of the 2.2L in the RS. Also, it was missing those badass white wheels, and Rally Sport trim. 




 1991 Chevy [Cavalier RS](http://carphotos.cardomain.com/ride_images/1/3093/1221/7730610002_large.jpg) Owned this car in high school/freshman year of college, and actually drove it from 2005 to 2007; which is shocking, because today it is one of the most egregious vehicles that I have ever seen let alone owned. 

The car was sort-of white and featured electric blue and black trim along each bumper and exterior door panel. Giant electric blue and black letters saying "CAVALIER RS" bedecked the driver doors. The Rally Sport edition that also had painted-white metal wheels. Mine was literally falling apart. Any parking lot where I closed my door was sprinkled with rusty dust. 

Then, literally everything on the car broke. Someone slammed into the driver's door in high school, so that didn't open. The power locks broke, so I was forced to climb through the trunk should I decide to lock the doors that actually worked. No A/C. No Heat. I came out of class one day to notice that the exhaust system had literally snapped in half, and  I dragged the pipe down the street going a top speed of 30mph with my gas pedal to the floor. 

The good news? I sold it for $100 in '07.

TLDR: The 1991 Cavalier RS is an incredibly shitty automobile.  




 But... these shirts were on clearance. 




 So, this is in Mexico? 




 It's a fantastic looking car. However, keep looking for someone willing to fall in love with it if you want top dollar. Despite the car being out of production, there seem to be plenty of them in the used market; I don't think you will get a ton of calls if you're pricing it over $20,000.

 [Here are a couple options through DC social sports.](http://dcsocialsports.com/leagues/soccer?state=LIVE locationId=) The co-ed league is more at the recreational level. (Although the teams I have played for had some really great females on them). The men's league is much more competitive. We play at the Long Bridge Park soccer fields, they are synthetic turf, and lighted for night games. Plus, the league usually has a bar component where everyone goes out and drinks post-game. 




 Will do; thanks for the resource! 




 I have been offered a position to teach middle school social studies in DC. After just speaking with my principal in passing, she said that she would like to sit down with me and discuss the "scope and sequence" for the 7th   8th Grade social studies curriculum next year. From my research, I'm picturing that this is a long term, big-picture framework for district wide lesson planning. However, she mentioned that she was not satisfied with the last social studies teacher's "scope and sequence." Which makes me believe that I may have to do some collaborating with her to make the overall, big-picture framework. 

Of course, when I sit down with her I would like to appear like I know what I'm talking about. So, if those of you out there in r/historyteachers-land could give me some information on what I can expect to talk to her about I'd greatly appreciate it! I have seemed very confident in my interactions with her thusfar, but she is a bit intimidating (Columbia Teachers' College grad, and also a big history nerd). Just trying to avoid being sent to the social studies teachers' graveyard like the last guy. 

[This is the only example I was able to locate online](http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/Files/downloads/In-the-Classroom/How-Students-Are-Assessed/Grade%207%20ELA%20SAS%20SY13-14.pdf)    

Thanks!  




 Also, that Focus is very fun to drive. I had to drive a friend of mine home once in a Focus hatch from this era, and I was very impressed with its pickup and handling. Probably had all the same features as yours, but she had hers shipped here from the Netherlands, so it gave it an extra cool factor. One of the most fun cars I've driven for sure. 




 It is a rare rear-wheel drive beast. However, this guy had [the last of the Grand Prix GXPs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pontiac_Grand_Prix_GXP_.jpg) 




 Just found this! [It's never too late, man](http://www.recycler.com/details/24681296) 




 Not necessarily stupid though, more of a sad trade-off. The area I moved to last winter made driving my Pontiac far too laborious. I got a "smarter" car that saves me money on both fuel and VA requirements. However, it lacks the special feel of driving the Pontiac. 

I was going through a quarter tank of gas every day working in DC, and then I find out that Northern VA has a 24-point inspection for road safety. (My driver's door didn't shut properly   power windows didn't work among some other issues with the power steering) All in all, I sold it in MD for $4000 in exchange for a friendlier DC driver (the Elantra). 

In summary, we aren't making "stupid" decisions, just dealing with the reality of the increasingly Pontiac-less motoring world of today.  




 your rant is completely justified. I can't even tell you how many people had the same criticism of GM about the frankly dumbass choice of preserving Buick. The consumers need to let their voice be heard. Time to put the soulless division of Buick to sleep and resurrect the excitement that was Pontiac!!!!!!
 




 I feel you. I had a Grand Am GT Coupe that I bought when I was 19, and I just let it go this past February. Let's not credit Pontiac for making the best quality cars; but Pontiacs did inspire a certain feeling for those who owned them. It was certainly a car that I was excited to drive.  




 let's hope. Front end looks majorly improved. 




 $33, not too big of a deal  




 Well put. Although, I wish all my neighbors their just reward for not being a great resident of Alexandria like myself.  




 Yeah. Plus, it isn't very much anyway. I've paid 3 times as much for "city-stickers" before. Guess I should have made the association that city-sticker=a source to generate revenue for the local gov't (aka TAX). Initially, I was taken aback back by the term "vehicle property tax."
 




 I've been in Alexandria for about six months now, but after buying a car in FL, and then switching over to VA license and registration I have paid the "vehicle property tax" and posted the sticker on my car as proof. 

Here's the thing, less than half the cars in my neighborhood have City of Alexandria stickers on them. I'm noticing that a number of the ones that do have stickers also have out-of-date ones. Is the vehicle property tax just something that isn't really enforced in AVA? And am I a sucker for even paying it?

 Unfortunately, I didn't get to experience the concept of the "two hour delays" that can happen here in the schools that I work in. (I would assume more snowfall needed.) The reactions are certainly different than the midwest; I remember having to walk to high school with 16 inches of snow on the ground in Chicago. I think my school had one snow day every 40 years. 




 Just moved here 1 month ago from Chicago. The top two things I miss are: 
1. The Blackhawks
2. Being able to order Giardiniera on things

I'm not about to jump on board with the Caps, though. I think we'll be lucky to see 5-6 Hawks games on local tv in DC this year. Such a shame, because this team is going to tear it up this year. 




 Got to love that car. Is that a Ford Aspire, Donovan?
 




 Raffi Torres for sure. 




 What about the [Dodge Daytona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Daytonashelbyz.jpg)? It looks like it was built on the same platform as the Starion; much like the Mitsubishi Mirage was to the Dodge Colt. 
 




 Hondas and Toyotas have the best reputation for reliability; however, in your price range you can expect six-digit odometer numbers. I think that you may be able to find an Elantra with 60-70K miles on it.   




 Yep. Darryl Drake. 




 So what's up with Shaw then, just 1 goal on the season so far?  




 Thank you. From what I read in a guide to teacher certification reciprocity, it seemed that 3 years experience was almost a requirement to have my certificate recognized in MD.  




 Thanks! This is very helpful, I haven't really sought out the charter school opportunities in Chicago too enthusiastically, but I'm probably better equipped to take on those challenges now than I was a year ago. I'll definitely investigate. Any insight that your wife could provide would be greatly appreciated.

 Please tell me what is the job market for teachers like in the metropolitan area? 

I am moving here next month from Chicago as part of a project that my current employer is doing. However, I'm a certified teacher and haven't gotten a classroom in IL due to an insane disparity between many applicants and very few openings. (not to mention widespread district cutbacks, etc.) I'd love to teach in DC or northern VA. 

So redditor-educators of DC, what type of climate should I expect? Are there any districts that you know of that I should target? Do you know of any paraprofessional/teaching-aide positions that may be opening up in the near future? I'd love to get my foot in the door, and would be open to ditching my employer to make a positive step in obtaining my goal of teaching in the classroom. 

Any suggestions or advice would be much appreciated.

Thanks!!   




 That has got to be Wal-Mart. 




 Soccer fans are ok with it, because the result is 45 minutes of continuous play uninterrupted by commercials. 
























 Saw that driving on the Edens on my way home from work. Ruined my day. 




 I watched this last week. It will give you a snapshot of what gang life was like at Cabrini Green; however, the Venkatesh book will go more in depth about how massive housing projects like the Robert Taylor Homes bred a community ruled by gangs.  




 No way. Is that the sequel to Snowicane?  









 Yep. It's funny because there are like 4 people that live in Rosemont. But everyone has been to a concert/convention there at some point. 




 I also graduated from Leyden in 2006. Funny how so many Franklin Parkers are like phantoms. Most reactions to "I grew up by Grand and Mannheim" are followed by " where the hell is that?" 




 ...and precipitation levels are rising, Chicagoland... In my pants at least 




 Leave Tom alone, that was meteorological research for your information. 




 Make a short trip west on North Ave. Al-Mart has some quality mattresses and beds. Just got my second one from them. The first one I had was so solidly built that I needed a hacksaw to get it out of the bedroom.

Also, ask about free delivery; if you're in Humbolt Park you'll probably get it. 




 Thank you for clarifying, sausage king.  




 But is it *actually* Q101? ...Not yet at least 




 These pictures are actually pretty funny. All the players look exhausted. Kruger just looks confused (much like everyone else who heard he was on team Sweden). And at one point, Oduya and Hossa must have said. "That's  it we're done wearing shoes!"

That aside, this is going to be the highest caliber hockey since 2010; let's just hope our 10 hawks play well and don't get hurt.

 Gary is such a sad story. There were 180,000 people in Gary 50 years ago. Now there might be 75,000. About 50% of their kids are graduating from high school. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm going to assume that crime is out of control. I just moved back to Chicago after living in DC for a year. I stopped in Gary with my big clunky u haul, and was immediately approached by the gas station security guard. He seemed curious to know why I chose to stop there, then warned me it was a bad area. It just struck me as desolate. 




 no argument about that. so I'll just be a good Cubs fan, roll over and cry about how a Sox fan was mean to me again. 




 True. I'm ripping on Sox fans for their historically poor attendance. 




 This crow is just getting ready to tell a story about how he literally watched all of his friends and family drop dead of the West Nile Virus. "It was the summer of 2004..."

 This is assuming that the ballpark would be prepared for more than 20,000 people to show up. 




 Whoa, Hjalmarsson has a headless kid! 




 If you really love Hemingway you'll enjoy the place. I do remember going here on a field trip though. Some girl passed out because it was 95 degrees  in there. My teacher hated Hemingway, and later apologized for the trip being a part of the curriculum. There was a guy who was about 100 giving the tour, and I think his name was Jim Christmas. He was pretty hilarious.

For what it's worth, visit the Hemingway foundation across the street. There are some cool samples of his writing from way back, including a description of a football game that he wrote in 9th Grade at OPRF. Hemingway got an F on it. 




 Wait, how can people take a tour of "murder castle" if the building was destroyed long ago? I'm almost certain that the post office in Englewood occupies it's space today. 









 It's clearly a hybrid. Why don't you educate yourself and start caring for our planet?

 Geez, Food 4 Less! I know that the Chicago ban on handguns has been deemed unconstitutional, but that: BUY TWO HAMS GET A GUN! promotion is just a little over the top

 Weak PK call; Liverpool not deserving the lead right now. 
 




 That was my first championship. Had LT and Chad Johnson, when he was simply referred to as Chad Johnson.  




 Ha. I'm in DC and moving back to Chicago in a week. That is supposed to be a really good place to watch a game. Hockey News wrote a few years back that there really aren't bad seats there. Just make the trip, man I never made it up there while I lived out east, but it should be worth it.

 I was taking my students back from a field trip when all of this was happening. It was pretty disturbing for the community to hear about a gunman's presence, and disorienting for the students who were blocked off from moving west down East Capitol. 









 That is surprising. When he was in town playing for the Wolves a few years ago he was kind of a waste of roster space. He made no contributions offensively or defensively and lost every fight. 

But here's to hoping he has a run-in with Bollig today. 




 Incentive? 

Yes, this could work. As long as it is structured and serves a purpose. 20 minutes per week of reading current news stories and listening to music is a way I reward students if they meet the expectation. (All assignments attempted, no behavior referrals, no excessive tardies, etc.) 

Also hype up your incentives. Once a month, I'll raffle a Chipotle/Subway gift card to a student who has no missing assignments, no behavior referrals, and less than two tardies.

 The last time pro hockey was played in Indy was actually 2004. The Indianapolis Ice played there in the old IHL, and later the CHL. [This was their logo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Indy_Ice.png) although I would picture it more appropriately on a 99 cent bottle of water. 




 At least I can say that I have owned a Pontiac. He doesn't have one. 




 Thanks! An insane British guy definitely makes this thread a bit more interesting. 




 Yeah. Although he is playing against Revis, the guy is top 5 in receiving yards and is a home-run threat if your league rewards for longer touchdowns.

 I think the rivalry should get hyped with the Jets too. You've got 3 ex-hawks (Frolik, Ladd,   Byfuglien) + playing in Toews's hometown. Should be a recipe for some exciting hockey.   
























 Ghana, Portugal, and Germany are all tough as hell matchups. You've got to love that rivalry that has developed with Ghana in the last decade though, they just have our number. That June 16th game is a must-see.

  Biggest buncha beauties in the league... How can you not love Crawford!?!? 




 I guess this will have to do now that they've discontinued *Gringo Bites* 




 I think some of the goalies that they lit up would be considered abysmal by Today's standards. So while they were a dynamo, let's look at some of the stats from the eighties with a level head. It was a different game back then.  




 I guess they both were; but the Cincinnati team did have Kunitz, Corey Perry, Bryzgalov, and Bylsma the previous year.   




 AND... Coached by none other than Scotty Bowman! I was only 4 but I vaguely remember my dad getting frustrated that they just owned the Hawks in the Finals. I re-watched that series last summer, and man did they ever dominate.  




 A bit off topic but how about some of these rosters from recent memory in the AHL? 

[Philadelphia Phantoms](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0007932005.html) Patrick Sharp, Mike Richards, Jeff Carter, Umberger, Seidenberg, Pitkanen.

[Cincinnati Mighty Ducks](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0009592005.html) Lupul, Ryan Getzlaf, Chris Kunitz, Penner, Glencross, Coached by Danny Bylsma. 

 




 How about the Oilers!?!?!?!

Sure goalies were crap during their reign, but [take a look at this 1983-84 roster!](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0000411984.html). In addition to GRETZKY (87G and 205 points) their top d-man, Coffey puts up 40G and 126 points! Kurri, Messier, and G.Anderson all with 100 points. Are you kidding me?  




 *Don't TOEWS me, bro* 

-Granlund 




 Hjammer really is Slalom Ninjasharks back there. Blocking shots with his throat, what *doesn't* he do. 




 I think the FLYAHS were the only one he got wrong. 









 Right, and I think that Jones did an excellent job explaining this in the link above; my point was not to look at the "white flight" aspect so simply.  




 I wouldn't say "spot on". It's more complex than that. He attributed the "white flight" of the 1940s to white people of the Southside feeling disenchanted with living next to black people for the simple reason that they didn't like black people. 

However, this perspective doesn't take into account that a lot of white people left the city in 1968. Things were so incredibly screwed-up that Chicago wasn't safe for many white people or black people. Mayor Daley was ordering the police to shoot rioters on site. White police treated blacks brutally. Some blacks treated whites brutally; there were people attacked on the streets because their skin was a certain color. Whites and blacks were both the victims or racism. This was the year most of my family members moved out of the city, including my grandfather who was told not to show up to work without a gun during the riots. He worked in a factory. 

These charged-up feelings have persisted for years and carried over to later generations. My dad used to deliver tires on the Southside during the 80s. He was put in a lot of dangerous situations including one where bat and club-wielding guys surrounded his truck in an alley shouting "Get the fuck out of the truck white boy." So, he went to his supervisor (who was black) and told him that he had to send a black guy on that route for his own safety. 

So it's easy to say that the "white flight" was based on arbitrary dislike for black people; for some, however, the charged-up emotions that have scarred groups of people for decades are too much to live with day to day. That isn't to say that I don't empathize with those stuck in the impoverished neighborhoods.   




 I'll take it. Just let me pick up one of those vacuums from *Luigi's Mansion.*

 I found myself in a similar situation recently. I actually needed to move 700 miles back home due to the declining health of my future mother in law. I was as professional and honest as I could have been, and my administrators took note. I also offered my help in finding a highly qualified replacement candidate. 

I gave them a clear picture that this decision was based on my commitment to family. It was by no means an easy decision for me and I felt sick about it for weeks, but all three administrators showed empathy and professionalism. They have been my biggest advocates for getting back into the classroom. It is hard to feel confident about a decision like this, but as long as they saw your talents and are decent human beings it should not be an inhibitor in your career. 




 Cue the Ryan Miller ready-to-cry face. Should be an intense series, nonetheless.

 El Gallo Bravo on Montrose just west of Clark has some $5 carne asada burritos capable of making your belt buckle burst. Their tacos are also great.

 Forest park may be a good option; Oak Park may be stretching this dude's budget thin. Wait until you find out you have to pay a decent chunk of change to park your car on Oak Park streets past 11pm 




 So, I'm going to recommend that you look at Elmwood Park or River Grove. I take it that your schedule doesn't allow you to use public transit. These towns are outside the city of Chicago, but if it is crucial that you are able to be in Maywood in 20 mins notice then you could be in Maywood in that time window. 

I'm not sure what your definition of "ghetto" is, so I'm steering you clear of the west side and Maywood. I grew up in Melrose Park and most people in the neighborhood talked about Maywood as if it were a lawless hellhole (although it is right next door and not too different than Melrose Park)

Elmwood Park/ River Grove are neighbors to the city, and if your planning to access the city by car it won't take too long. However, if you insist on living in the city of Chicago, then look at Jefferson Park or Old Irving Park. (With traffic do not assume that Maywood would be 20 mins away at any given time... or ever really)   




 Did Emerick say that Svengoolie has been showing "kiddie films" on Chicago TV for 44 years? Where the hell does he get these facts from?

 Hoping we take the time to get him acquainted with the North American game, even if it means spending a year in Rockford. Before Tony Salmelainen came to the Hawks he was absolutely scoring at will in Finland. However, he wasn't able to do much here. we have the depth now to take the time for a speedy Fin to get immersed in North American hockey. 




 Wondering if the Buick score is skewed by the demographic owning most of them; perhaps they are "reliable" since they barely get driven.

 Look at the North or West areas of Alexandria. It's moderately expensive but Arlington in sky high. 




 When my fiancee and I lived in the DC metro we had a combined income of 90k and we still couldn't justify living in Arlington. We ended up on the West end of Alexandria for significantly cheaper. About 10 mins from Arlington and about 30 from Capitol Hill. 1 Bedroom apts. in Arlington are about $1700; it's pretty unjustifiable. I'm getting way more for my money in Chicago; however the job market in the DC metro area is great. 

I'd say focus on work first, get that promotion, and then live in Arlington. NoVA is pretty damn expensive.

 The length of the North American season   playoffs and travel factors do not make it feasible for NHL teams to be participants. However, it's not necessarily elitist to say that the North American teams would add a highly co mpetitive element to the league. Not to undermine European hockey, but it would be an awesome showcase to see vastly different styles of play go head to head. 




 Perhaps it is a step in the right direction, but the Model E is not going to be a "mass market" car like some are saying. It's projected to cost Tesla $48,000 to make one, so those figures of it being under $40,000 are not going to come to fruition. 

I remember before the Model S hit the showroom, there was a Tesla display at the mall. The guys from Tesla were showing off the Model S as a concept and saying "It will be available for under $50,000." We know how that turned out. 




 Are we considering the $40,000 concept vehicle a "mass market" vehicle. Sure, long term ownership will save many people a significant amount of money in fuel costs, but damn, that is a lot of money to fork over.
 




 It does depend where you live.
