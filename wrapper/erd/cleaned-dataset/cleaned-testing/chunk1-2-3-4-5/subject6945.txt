 I'll swap you for my girlfriend...  




 *facepalm* 




 I change my tampon 




 yep, I can cross Canada off my places to visit list... 




 if you come to me and make this, I will pay you any amount of money. 




 such a sad day  




 7/11 




 nope, that's just a severe case of gingivitis. 




 I Have not played this game in years!!! I completed about 3/4 of the game before a douchebag friend scratched the fuck out of it :(  




 karma whoreing your own son... parenting done right  




 I pay $5.99 for a haircut to have the hairdressers boobs rub on my head  




 I have been fooled by that many times  




 quit work, problem solved  
























 I'm probably going to get the shit ripped through me for this, but I'm new here so cut me some slack. 

why is asking what to get a bad thing? 
I only ask because I was just about to make a post asking for some advice on some good gear and places to get it from for someone who isn't familiar with all this.  




 that's what happens when you make out with a vacuum cleaner 




 I don't want to live on this planet anymore.  




 uptokes all round to share the love!!  




 you're an idiot, that's not dave.  




 well about 6 years ago my dad got his first mobile phone, and for about 6 months he kept forgetting where the space key was so every message I would get would be one big head fuck that I would have to go through, it didn't help that my sister told him "2 typ lik dis 2 mak it shorta".  




 as the title explains I'm struggling to find a suitable FIFO job in the mining sector. 

I am a qualified fitter and machinest with a wide variety of experience, but I'm having trouble finding work in the mines. 

mainly due to the fact I'm unsure of where to start looking, Iv tried all the main job search sites but can't seem to find anything suitable or within my qualifications, most jobs Iv found have been for high up supervisor jobs and such, and seeing as Iv only been qualified for 7 months I doubt I will have any luck with a job like that. 

all I have been hearing about is this "mining boom" where so many people are getting these amazingly high paid jobs, but I can't find them! 

so if any of you have any advice on how I can get my foot in the door I would really appreciate it! :) 

 




 when I was 14, i ran into a door at full speed and knocked myself out cold while chasing a friend around his house. the last thing I remember was his mum yelling " stop running around before someone gets hurt!!!" then bam I was out. scored I nifty little scar under my eye from it.  




 fitter and machinist here! finished my apprenticeship 6 months ago and trying to make my way to the WA to toll away in the mines 




 fuck you.  




 can someone tell me how long that thing went for? I gave up after seeing the fetus and realised it wasn't goin to stop  




 proposed to my girlfriend... 




 the look on the office ladys face at work when I ran out of the toilet in a rush with my pant down to answer the phone because I thought I was the only person there.  
























 Sitting on the toilet, post sexy time, in my birthday suit, on my birthday! Can't get much better 




 that is a fucking big lathe! how long does it take to set up something that big? 




 you're never too old man! have fun and enjoy :) 




 try those little $2 shops full of completely random crap in big shopping centre's, that's where I got mine from.

 golden rule of industry: don't stick your fingers where you wouldn't stick ya dick.  




 too late 









 a bud, because that's exactly what it is.  




 I'm the same with the term "nug"  




 Well she proves smoking doesn't stunt your growth.  




 If it was not for the movie where Emma Stone dressed up like a tramp and left me with half a chubb for an hour and a half I would not get this reference.  




 makes sense to me, I'll make sure I check it all out 





























 The urge to kick one of those tables is overwhelming.  




 that photo was taken a few hours after the first, same thumb.  









 I don't get this "several times" buisness, are you suppose to last more than one or two pumps?  




 i know i may be a bit late to the party, but iv been wanting to try it for some time but no one can ever seem to get any. help a brother out? 




 Yes! I watched it for the First time last week and i can't get over it!  




 i thought he was having a stroke, but really determined to quench his thirst.   




 i am the husband-to-be! nah there was 10 people including the pilot, so its a bit of a tight fit but worth it! 




 Totally worth it! You get over an hour and a half air time and a free breaky! The take off and landing are a bit tricky but at the time you don't really think about it.  









 only one way to find out! 




 obviously they have never been to dandenong 
























 Just woke up from a 14 hour night shift. Imagination broken 




 It's such a beautiful day, give me something to do. Anything at all. 




 Just sold my 1st item on gumtree. Person picked it up and I wasnt raped or murdered. Today is a good day. 




 Centrecom in sunshine are just as bad. I called them to check if they had a certain graphics card, was on hold for 15 minutes then was told they had plenty in stock. I told him I would be there in 30 minutes to grab it and if he could get one ready for me which was all good. Then I get there to find out they dont actually have any at all. Apparently i was the arsehole for wanting the next model up for the same price because they fucked me around.  




 I usually take my own outside micrometer set (0-100mm), depth micrometer set and vernier. All shops iv worked in have supplied them but its hard to keep track of the condition of the tools when everyone else is using them too. Also a dial indicator and base. Very easy for them to be damaged and no one says anything, potentially causing you trouble down the track.  




 24, been in the trade for 7 years. finished a 4 year apprenticeship in australia as a fitter and turner/ toolmaker. Moved into maintenence for the dollars but we still have a couple of lathes and a mill we use for repairs, breakdowns and general bits and pieces. Kinda miss being in a proper tool shop though.

 I was chasing a friend around the house and some how I ran flat out into a door and knocked myself out. Left a nice little scar under my right eye.  




 sooooooo... im getting lucky? 




 It still is pretty common. I lost a friend of the family recently to dravet syndrome, she was only 11 and basically minutes after she passed there were photographers there who work for the hospital and asked the mother if she would like some photos taken, she said yes, and a few of them were actually used at her funeral.  




 Basically I'm interested in having a session in a sensory deprivation tank, and would like to know if anyone here who has done it in or around Melbourne and could suggest somewhere to do it? After a quick google search most of the stuff I have found is for myotherapy and pain relief sort of thing, not sure if they would cater for someone looking to chill out.  




 I was so pissed when they broke up :(  




 It's the name of the band
