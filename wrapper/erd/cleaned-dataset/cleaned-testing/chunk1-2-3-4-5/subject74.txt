 My shower was going normally...and then I had the bright idea to try and shave in a stand up shower. This may sound risky in itself but I've done it before so I thought I was a certified pro at it. So, the arm pits happen without a hitch but then I start on more risky territory. As I'm finishing up  I'm realizing the quality of my razor isn't totally on the up and up. I only paid $6 for 3 so I should've known. But, here we are. I have a partially shaved butt and a bleeding finger. And to top it all off band-aids don't stick to anything wet, so I ended up getting blood all over my towel trying to get out of the shower. The worst part is it all happened at my boyfriend's house. 

*As a side note, my finger took the brunt of the damage from the razor because the damn thing was so flimsy and cheaply put together the replaceable head comes off without any warning.  




 I actually didn't do it for any significant reason...I just like how it looks pointing that way.  









 Thanks for the input! I think you're right. I'm definitely going to cross hatch the color to try to improve it!  




 thanks! I'll give that a try!  









 Just a quick drawing! Hope you like it! http://imgur.com/eAoiBMk 




 Thank you! :) I've never heard of those, I'll have to check it out!  




 No problem! And thank you! :) It actually was, I worked at it over a few day span so it was a fun end to the day. haha. :D  









 I'm actually so pleased with how this came out, I really hope you like it! http://imgur.com/SXzt8zB 




 Hey, it's just a quick little pen sketch with minimal color...and the quality is a little off because I'm lacking a scanner...(a.k.a I took this with my phone) sigh. I hope you like it though! :) http://imgur.com/vwE5kwi 




 I'm glad you like it! And you're very welcome!! 




 It's just a quick pen sketch with a little bit of color...I thought it would still be worth posting. Hope you like it! http://imgur.com/Bgob3O9 




 Awww thank you! c: I'm really glad you like it! And you're very welcome! 3 




 Drew a quick sketch, it came out a bit blurry in the picture...I hope you like it though! http://imgur.com/NA7BrEJ 




 Thank you so much! It's wonderful, I absolutely love the vibrant colors :) 




 I did a quick drawing with marker and black pen...I really hope she likes it! http://imgur.com/Y8fTvyN 









 This is just a quick little drawing but it's my attempt at it. Anyway, hope you like it!

 I actually just checked the map and there doesn't seem to be anyone in my area on that map either! The closest to NS is Quebec! :o 




 ohhhhh awesome!  




 No, I'm located in Halifax, NS, Canada!! I definitely can't afford to travel that far!  




 I'm having no luck finding a person or salon in my area that would install syn dreads and I just ordered a set. Eeeeek. Not sure if it's okay to post this type of thing but I need help and no one I know has dreads... 




 thanks! 




 Thanks! I'm drawing every spare moment I have!! haha.(Although that isn't much as I have had a summer job and I'm in an intensive IT program) I'm focusing on dot work designs lately. I find they turn out the best. I've been trying to focus on tattoo-able designs.  I actually did have an artist in mind and got a side tattoo from him but he's never taken on an apprentice...I'm thinking once I'm back to the city I'll go in and talk to someone from the same shop. 
Thanks again for the advice! 




 I'm working on a portfolio to take in and I have a shop in mind but I know nothing about how I should go about it besides that...I'm also very nervous about taking in my portfolio. I feel as though it could never be good enough as I have no actual experience tattooing and I haven't had any training besides advanced high school courses. I really need to also mention that my art isn't "photo realistic" I have a graphical/2D kind of style to my work. Any advice would be very appreciated!  




 thanks! :) 




 I'm looking at starting to use baking soda and ACV instead of shampoo and conditioner...Any really good recipes out there? That are more than the basic mix? Like something with tea tree oil etc. I'd really appreciate any advice I can get on this.  




 sweet, thanks! 




 I'm in Canada so that sucks! haha. and nice!  




 Hmmm, is that in US dollars or CND?  




 That's true, thank you. I was thinking fruits and vegetables, as well as oatmeal without sweet flavoring added would be good places to start. I'm hoping to keep my diet as low carb as possible. And I'm pretty small/female. So my MAX calorie intake is about 1400.  




 But I honestly can't stick to it right now. I just can't sit down, figure out my macros and then plan my grocery shopping and meals off of that. I'm not good at meal prep. That's the main problem I'm having so I'm trying to find foods that are easily prepared. I'm also looking into nutrition bars. But, quest bars are out of my price range at  $40 per 12. so...I'm hoping there's a better alternative. I really appreciate any tips or advice I'm given. I'm still very new to trying to lead a healthy active lifestyle.  




 okay, thanks!  




 Hmmm, its starting to sound like it's worth just waiting til my hair grows out! Do you know if the dreads were successful at 6-8 inches? Like did they end up keeping them and having them look good? 




 my hair doesn't even curl on its own. Even when I don't comb it, no joke. It's crazy straight and fine. 
 




 thank you for the input! I'm still thinking I'll grow my hair out and try to get natural ones in the future. My hair is way too short for that right now though unfortunately. Parts of my hair are only 3 inches. For some reason shaving it seemed like a good idea.  




 I love the look of dreadlocks, I've been trying to grow my hair out to get them forever now. I haven't managed to do it but I'm thinking synthetic dreads would be a good alternative for me because I'm a Caucasian girl with thin/straight hair too. I'm wondering a few things about getting them...Such as how long should my existing hair be in order to put them in? And where should I typically go to get them put in? I've called a few places that offer extensions but no one there knows anything about putting in synthetic dreads...I know a few people that can dread actual hair would they have an easy time putting in syn ones?  
























 Last time I got a BMI test done at my ymca that included a body fat percentage...It was around 24.1% and my waist is around 27 inches. So, according to that I'd be average.  




 I will be honest with you, I do not like what I see in the mirror most days. It's easy for me to pick out the flaws instead of 'good parts'. And I don't receive compliments very often.  




 My BMI is 23.4, which is on the higher side of normal weights based on the calculator I used...Now, I'm 5'1...124 lbs...and I'm a 19 year old female...Is this a normal weight for my height and age? I've been made to feel like its not by most BMI calculators etc. I also gained a lot of weight in the past year...I started community college last year and gained 20 lbs. I used to be 110, so I've lost about 6 lbs since I gained weight. I think this might be why I'm so worried about my weight but I'm interested in getting opinions as mine may be biased. Any advice is appreciated.  









 I find after 2 coats its looks opaque on my nails, I absolutely love it...Maybe try a clear coat over top if you're finding it too thin?  




 the ring and pinky finger designs look a little busy but besides that I think they look absolutely lovely. :)  









 Yeah, I'm learning its better just to do it myself! haha, mine don't turn out every time but atleast I'm only paying out for polish and remover! I totally agree with you, I'd feel soo bad if I couldn't give someone exactly what they wanted for their mani. I'm sure your nails always look beautiful, they definitely do in the now picture! :)  




 Same!!! The red I used for dots bleeds too so that definitely didn't help things. haha. 




 Yeah, you're definitely right...I didn't wait long enough for it to dry...I thought I did but I didn't. And I didn't have any clear coat besides glitter. I know for next time though! In hindsight I should've left them white with the purple and pink middle piece. It looked tidy.  









 I paid $70 for a mani and it looked like the then...Except she couldn't even do designs and she was the only in house nail 'artist'....One of the nails broke in half on me 2 days later...She told me it was gel and that it could only come off with an electric file or acetone remover...I basically filed it off after one of them broke... 




 I found leaving mine alone and not painting them for about a week or less always got rid of it.  




 No problem! And I am too, it's a really shitty experience for her to have during her second tattoo...I told her most artists aren't like that and everything and she seemed to get it but I'm sure she's holding off on getting more for awhile.  




 yeah, she moved once...told the artist it really tickled and apologized for moving and then stayed still.  




 Also, my friend is 18 and still fairly new to being tattooed so...she does have a bit of leeway in my mind...  




 She was a guest artist so I don't think I'll ever see her around again. But, if anyone asks me about my opinion of her ever I'll keep chode in mind as a describing word.  




 Admittedly she was, I cringed at her behaviour and didn't encourage it at all, but it still didn't justify the reaction from the artist in my opinion. She's even been  tattooed before and wasn't an annoying client at all. I was honestly very surprised by both of them but I expected the artist to react in a professional manor.   




 I will try to get a picture, its my friend's tattoo though so I don't have any on hand. lol.  




 I thought so, but I wanted to make sure! haha, I do too definitely left a bad taste in my mouth.  
























 I'm looking for advice on how to improve my current make up or what to buy and how to use it based on my features and skill level which is very beginner...The first two pictures are me with make-up the last is without...I currently use: 

foundation: rimmel London stay matte primer, Maybelline dream fresh bb, and an organic brand loose powder.

eye: bonne bell eyeliner in black, cover girl eyeenhancers shadow in sombre relzadora which is white with sparkle, covergirl lashblast fusion.

brows: flamingo brow pencil in light brown...its an off brand Asian company I believe.  









 Mine have gone back after decent sized stretches, I stretched mine 3 times so far...The first time they shrunk back to 8g in 2 days...the second time they shrunk back to 8g in 3 days...and I'm currently still on the third stretch...Actually I went to a 00g all 3 times...it is possible for certain people...everybody has different skin elasticity and heals differently.  




 That sounds awesome! Thank you!  




 Do you think your friend would be willing to consider taking on doing a strangers? lol. I'm having no luck, and I'm not talented enough to do them myself. 




 Does anyone on this page know how or know someone who does... that is located near or in Halifax, Nova Scotia? 




 Thank you! :) 




 I didn't have any help what so ever, it took me 3 hours the first time...But, I've gone back and put in double elastics so I'd say 4-4.5...lol 




 Hmmm, that is odd. And thank you! :) I definitely will, I've gotten so many compliments since then that I honestly can't even believe it...People I don't even know have stopped me in person just to tell me they look good. I really appreciate your comment, its really nice to receive more positivity than negativity. :) 




 I doubt theres enough people for it to catch on, and I'm glad you're not...However, I posted them here and received down votes etc. And was basically told I would continue to be down voted just a heads up...ahah. I joined r/FancyFollicles  




 Thanks! And yes, they are...They're handmade by Heather at Divinity Dreads. She's amazing...And I went with the synth route because I have very short hair at the moment, I have thin, straight hair, and I wasn't sure if they would suit me so I thought a non committed approach would work best for me! And these locs are a million times nicer than anything I could achieve naturally...mine would look like braids 




 Its okay, these are not dread falls though...They're extensions that braid in and they are natural colors so they blend with my normal hair...They essentially look like dreads. 




 I'm pretty sure having synth dreads doesn't make me goth...you're either really rude or a frigging trollll. They literally look like real dreads except I'm honest enough to say they're not.... 




 Well, the shampoo seems to be sulfate free...and actually after buying the conditioner I stopped using it almost immediately because the one I bought doesn't say its cone or sulfate free...it only says color and parabens...But thank you for the input! :)  









 Is this shampoo free from enough chemicals(parabeans, silicone, color, etc) that its good to use on dreads or instead of going shampoo free? 









 I guess I could've phrased it a lot better...but I posted to a fitness sub reddit because I was hoping I could get better advice that way. If I just wanted to feel better about myself I would've posted something to facebook or somewhere similar.  




 Actually I was wondering if it is the best way to measure my fat to weight ratio and what range I fall under. It is not about feeling better about myself emptily. I am still exercising and trying to lose the weight and I intend to continue with it. No matter what response I got I intended to keep exercising. I honestly just want to know the best way to calculate this sort of thing so that I can measure my progress...Because there's really no physical difference yet as far as muscle etc.  




 Thanks! :) I really do want to work on tone and building muscle so I will continue to try but I feel much better about my current weight now.  
























 I definitely get that he needs to get help for his bipolar disorder...and that other people could love those qualities. 

He doesn't call me names or do anything like that...

However, I see your point and appreciate your honesty. 




 Its for Information Technology and I'm thinking a deep red heel and deep red or black blouse... 




 My mom is a hairdresser and basically the low down on clarifying shampoo is that it shouldn't be used twice and its to remove impurities such as chlorine...

It shouldn't be used regularly and is actually really hard on your hair. 

Kind of feel like I'm missing the context of why your hair dresser told you this...Although, even if you switched colors to blonde or lighter a 'blonde shampoo' is a better choice.   




 The lather from shampoo actually isn't a good measure of anything as its all chemically created...I use dread shampoo and the lather is very very minimal and consistent because it doesn't contain these chemicals...Even Sulfate free shampoos typically have other chemicals in them...

My hair acts much better and the natural oils in my hair are not stripped from washing daily. Because I use natural oil based dread shampoo, which comes in a bar like soap..It doesn't strip any oil. Its all about what you're using.

 




 This has happened to me too recently...I've been on Marvelon 21 for over 2 years and now that I'm taking it continuously it seems very very useless. 22 days and 3 doctor's appointments/clinic visits later my period got to be over. Beyond terrible and my family doctor won't switch me to anything else. 




 She isn't a specialist but I don't really understand the difference between a specialist and a gyno/surgeon...There's only one specialist close to my area in the listings here(Halifax/Nova Scotia) and I can't find any info for him when I click the link...

And thank you for the well wishes!  




 Thank you for the advice and well wishes, I'll look into heating pads for sure! 

I know what you mean about exercise, I lose my energy very quickly. And its super frustrating because I used to be an athlete and now yoga is hard. But, I'm going to keep at it. 

 I'll try to keep physio in mind if/when I get a diagnosis.  




 I've been taking fish oil as part of my supplement routine as well as vitamin D.

 I'm actually as it happens lactose intolerant, I do try to have milk alternatives for ice cream and milk but mostly just veer away from it all because I find soy bothers me as well. 

I can see how exercise can help, I'll have to start trying some yoga..

Thanks for the advice and the well wishes, I have an appointment to see a surgeon/gyno on May 29th. Hoping she schedules me for a lap.  




 Thank you very much for the advice, I think you're right...I'll look into doing both of these! It definitely has been taking a toll, 




 I'm in Ns and wondering if this one is still current? I clicked the link in the added section but his name wasn't listed anywhere on the page... 




 Would you mind explaining the difference I'm new to all this... 




 I'm currently being relatively untreated for my endo...I'm taking vimovo(basically naproxen) twice daily 500mg. And taking my birth control continuously with issue...My appointment with my new gyno is in 2 months or so...And I'm in pain daily, low pelvic pain mostly sometimes its leg and back too though. I've been trying to manage my diet, I've cut out coffee, soy, all dairy except cheese, eggs, and started taking supplements, eating fiber, and drinking green tea...Is there anything else I can be doing to help myself? 




 _sinnerbynature 




 just wondering about how to start with this method and the best things to use for combs with back combing and that sort of thing...Does this method typically have a lot of shrinkage? How long should my hair be before I start this method...Is it possible to do your whole head alone? 




 "yurbuds, Ironman inspire series"...They're designed for the gym, and have an optional clip...As well as play, pause, etc buttons built in...The rubber piece that locks them in can be taken off if you want to use them for normal activities...

 









 Aw, thank you! :) My budget isn't great I'm kind of limited to drug store and discount stuff at the moment...I'd really like to keep my everyday look more of a natural kind of thing but I'd really appreciate any other look suggestions you think would like good! I think I just prefer natural where I'm new to make up. I like highlighting my eyes, maybe my cheek bones but I have no idea where to even start on that one. 

I really appreciate that suggestion I'm definitely going to give it a try! I'm picturing it and I think you're right about the definition without harshness...I do find the black liner a little harsh around my eyes. 




 Where can I get NYX products? I live in Canada if that helps...and Thank you so much for the suggestions! :)  




 That sounds very very doable, and hmmm...I will have to look into something a bit cheaper for sure, I'm a student on a budget but I appreciate the suggestion. 
And thank you! :) I find its a bit red without foundation but overall I can't complain. haha.  




 Well, I'm currently a student so the drug store price range is definitely ideal...I'll definitely look into the Maybelline nude palette! Thank you :) And, I have a brush I will use with my eyeshadow...it could probably be better though, lol. I'm not sure what kind of color I should go for with blush...I've never used it as I'm fairly new to make up in general. Thank you so much for the compliments they mean a lot! :) 
I'll look into the lip butters as well, I recently picked up a red lip tint but I'm not too sure about it yet...Its called santa baby from lush...I feel like red is a little too bold can you recommend me a few colors? :)
