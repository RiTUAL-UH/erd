 Agreed. 




 Drapes would be too interesting. 




 Yes. 









 It's've* 




 Oh, you're too kind, dear.  




 I know someone like this. He's a dear.

 Examples? 




 My manager who used to work at a casino in Louisiana said that he would see the Duck Dynasty guys all the time and they would lose ridiculous amounts of money on a regular basis. 









 Whoa 




 Studying for math. 




 I remember the first time I played Oblivion. After leaving the sewers, I didn't turn around, so I had no idea the imperial city was right behind me. Just spent two hours walking around looking for one of those damn cities. 




 I think the most interesting thing about a WWI game would be the fact that they combined (at the time) futuristic weaponry with very obsolete strategies. That's one of the things that made the war so devastating. It wasn't only trench warfare, a lot of interesting things could be done with it.

 They've announced Lobo as the first DLC character. 




 What did your grandmother ever do to you?

Edit: and now my joke makes no sense... 




 It actually works on low and high attacks. I'm not very good at hitting it at the right time, though. 




 I think I'd enjoy MK style mechanics over SF style. Street Fighter has just never really appealed to me that much. Just my two cents. 




 You, sir, are a poo. 




 Actually, a project called "Version Two" was supposed to be made into Battlefront 3. First Assault was gonna be a marketplace game to help fund the soon-to-be Battlefront II sequel. 




 Wait, people don't do that? What do they say now? 




 Yeah, I think it's RMCF, I remember the one in Winter Park, CO had one outside. 




 Man, this is totally shopped. Get out of this subreddit, poseur. 




 Feminists are so conceited sometimes. I swear to god, they think anything to do just with men is an insult to them, somehow. I once held a door open for a woman and she started screaming at me about how I'm doing it because I think she's "weak" and because she's a woman. Bitch, I don't care what gender you are, I was just being polite. 




 Russia isn't, sir. 




 If you want a Star Wars shooter, there's a pretty cool mod for CoD 4.  




 Since I work for mainly tips, fuck you, you can't have my services.

 To put it simply, Tolkien really didn't like technology.

 "Ahh.. Pop that pussy for a real nigga
Pull out my black card, that's my lil nigga
Make a movie with your bitch, Steven Spiel nigga"

Oh, Lil Wayne... What would we do without you and Steven Spielnigga? 




 I can't blow my goddamn nose. 




 That's an awfully curvy L, don't you think?

Edit: in all seriousness, though, that's pretty cool. 




 My parents and I all thought I was just high energy, then I was diagnosed with ADHD. Aren't logical fallacies awkward? 




 Relevant username. 




 Totally just read that in Nigel Thornberry's voice. 




 Dude, me too. Fuck rainbows. 




 You smiled at your sex as the door shut? 




 As someone who works at a car wash/detailing place, I can relate. I can relate so gooooood. 




 A friend of mine was at the Olympic training center for archery and met Michael Phelps. When he tried to say hi, Phelps just said, "Fuck off," and walked away. 




 Hit the nail right on the head. Exactly how I feel, man.

 This is essentially Japan's wet willy. 




 Nice pin stripe! 




 I've been fairly lucky with my first gen PS3 still kickin'. Though the fan sounds like a Boeing. 




 Would a "put.... Put your dick in it" be relevant here?  




 Totally thought a car was gonna hit him at the end. 




 Am I a bad person if I saw black face immediately? 




 I stopped going to the fridge at night because I'd accidently leave the milk in the glass cabinet.... 




 If you aren't making eye contact you aren't doing it right. 




 It literally took me 2 minutes to see the damn goat. Ashamed. 




 The fact that that happened to her is kinda morbid, but the general post is kind of uplifting.  




 Well, from the video he could've easily been white, so you did make assumptions.  




 Put... Put your dick in it... 




 She's cuuuuute. Kinda. Like in a baby kitten road kill kinda way. If it were covered in more dead kittens. And then had that volcano on her face added on for good measure. 




 A Russian exchange student at my school told me it's just highly recommended.  




 "Ur" repetitive. 




 She should go pro! 




 He died instantly.... The next day. 




 I've heard they also have villages where they send people with HIV and AIDS to die.

 Half-Life. I want them to just say that 3 won't be made so I can be done with it forever. The fandom is annoying, Gordon Freeman isn't really a character, so why should he be revered the way he is, and I'm tired of hearing about it literally everywhere. 




 That band, man... 




 MOTHERFUCKIN' SHIBE 




 So worth it. 




 I Hate Hartley 




 Saw these guys on their first American tour. They were amazing then and have only gotten better!

 I never got to see it, what was so bad about it? 




 Shaking hands....

 We've known Teppei personally for a few years, now. He's a really cool and layer back guy!

Edit: We took him to dinner before the shows every time he came to CO since we met him. 









 I still do. It's the handle, man. The handle makes drinking anything better. 




 Most probable worst case scenario, you YLOD and need new thermal paste. You'll probably be ok! 




 My school had an assembly about it. I had no choice. 




 Wait... Then what the fuck is a berry? 




 It's a collection of all the TF2 comics, L4D comics, and the like for other games. 




 That sounds fucking awesome. Literal all-star cast. 




 Ah, I see you've unlocked the [Butthurt] trait. New player? 




 Thanks for making me realize I don't know how borrowing works... Asshole. 




 Aaaaaaaaand you're a bad person. 




 One of my favorite bands! 









 FUCK YOU, FERD, YOU UNFABULOUS SHIT

Edit: Why the *fuck* do I keep seeing you?! 




 You two will always be at odds.  




 Well, realistically, Tolkien never would've been able to finish it because it's just so extensive. 




 Dammit, I can't handle unfinished Middle-Earth, if GoT is never finished I'll go insane. 




 Yeah, I pretty much said "fuck that" after seeing words like vivacious, bemused, and haughtiness. I learned two of those words last year. 




 Everything on NoSleep is true even if it isn't. 




 Dude... Fuck you. 




 I'm afraid of the beach, oceans, and lakes for this very reason. 




 Tricycles. I am terrified of riding tricycles.

Edit: also, laying on my stomach with my legs hanging over an edge. I'm terrified someone is just going to walk up and break my knees by hitting/pushing my lower legs really hard.

Edit 2: OH! And moths flying into my ears.  




 It's gonna be Cooking Mama X Mass Effect! 




 I thought that was a subreddit and tried exceptionally hard to figure out how it would be relevant before clicking on it. Needless to say, I was disappointed. 




 /r/DIY ? It sounds like it belongs there... But I've never seen a casket on it, so I don't know. 




 Well there's different words for different age groups. I can't remember off the type of my head, but pedophile really only applies to a range of like 7-9 year olds or something like that. 




 What's one of the most fun things you've ever done and why? 




 I agree. Not to mention, I feel like exclamation points make me seem excited, so caps convey anger better. 




 I'd like some recommendations, any genre at all.  If you like it, I'll check it out.

Edit: Thanks a bunch! I'll do my best to check all of them out! 




 I'd like something new to read and I'm not going to say what I've already read in order to get a little more variety. So, bring it on!

Edit: Why the down votes? I'd just like a few new comics to read....

Edit 2: Thanks a lot, guys! I'll try and check all of them out!

 I saw a Prius that said "smuggg" on the plates in reference to the Southpark episode. I thought it was pretty funny. 




 There's nothing fabulous about you, Ferd.... 




 THANK YOU O_O 




 That's my phone's shadow. 









 Ooh! ME! 




 Over yonder! 




 I'm a T Swift fan, myself. 




 With Taylor Swift? She won an award and he jumped up on stage and took the mic from her and started screaming about how Beyonce should've won. It's where the "I'mma let you finish, but..." Joke came from. 




 There was a duffel bag left in the school parking lot and the police were called. All this bomb threat jazz and it was later found out to be a Kermit the Frog doll that was stolen from one of the teachers earlier that year. It is now a school "holiday" where everybody wears green.

 No one beats Liam fucking Neeson in FO3! 




 Well, since I'm all the way down here.... 




 I know a lot of military and they're good people that are going through exactly what we're going through. Don't blame them. 




 It was the same with me. A game with no dialogue or really in depth backstory made me tear up at the end. Only game that ever made me do that. 




 I'd recommend you get Journey and the Unfinished Swan. They're both PS Store purchases and they're amazing. 




 Oh, yeah. My bad. 




 There's an arcade game called T.E.C. 3001. It's awesome.

Edit: Indie* 




 Because it's a heavily anticipated game from a prestigious studio. 




 Well, by your logic, you got your ignorance from your father and you're completely ignorant of the fact. 




 YOU'RE AN AWFUL THREAD 




 As much as I dislike GameStop's way of business, I'd hate to see them go. They have some good stuff and the employees their are some of the best conversations I've had about the video game industry and really nice guys. 




 Completely absurd, my good man. 




 May I partake?


YOU SHIT-EATING, CRUSTY, JAGGED PIECE OF WALRUS ANUS 




 Not exactly what I was looking for, but I still like it! Thanks! 




 Like one that shows off really cool or creative cars, motorcycles, ect. 




 I also think the PS3's Netflix layout is a lot better. The Xbox' is just annoying to use. 




 I saw the thumbnail and didn't read the title... I thought it was an Anchorman 2 picture. I'll just say I was disappointed. 




 In quite a butthurt fashion, might I say. 




 The butthurt is strong in this one. 




 Ah, I believe you meant to say empanada, my good man. 




 I keep getting Serious Sam and Duke Nukem 3D coupons. 




 What's with Guy Fawkes masks and these pictures? 




 I... I take 45 minute bathroom breaks. No one believes that I just don't care enough to get up sometimes.

 We also like to verb nouns. 




 I just cannot do the Misfits. I can't explain why. 




 They were just touring with a bunch of heavier bands. If you're into metal/metalcore, that is. 




 My name is Mac. It's not so much annoying as much as I've just heard it all by now.

 Nope. 




 I've heard a lot of good things about it. I'll check it out! 














 So, "wore in my underwear while I made your order?" 




 Just your monthly reminder to go get a dog! 




 I feel like I've seen this video here multiple times in the past few weeks. I may be wrong, though. 




 Well, I can't explain them to you! I don't know what they are, either! 




 If you go to /r/bitcoin, there's lots of info there. 




 Don't need none'a that here! 




 I may have gone a little overboard... 









 I was seriously thinking it was the one I usually go to.... But your comment has made me second guess myself. 




 Every now and then I find myself wondering what it would be like if we just ejaculated one big sperm. It keeps me up some nights. 




 My neighbor's sister rear-ended somebody.... On her way out of the dealership. 




 When she was really young, my sister cut her hair on only one side of her head and then tried to walk past my mom and go to a friends house. She tried to play it off as her "falling" when my mom stopped her. 




 Yeah, but, ya know.... Fuck that. 




 KoTOR has to be one of my favorite games of all time! I've had it for years and only just finished it for the first time a few months ago. 




 Thank you! 









 Sex. I really don't care. 




 You realize how dark those movies really were, later on... And it's so fucked up. 




 Which Flashpoint is it, exactly? 




 I almost never use the Masterball out of fear that I'll need it some other time... 




 Why does religion always have to be cited as an enemy of science? The group that doesn't believe in these things is in the minority. You're being just as closed-minded as they are. 




 I don't know about trading, but you can sell at the LS Customs. 




 Swamps of Dagoba is a fucking masterpiece. 




 Well, there's all this philosophy about whether people are inherently good or evil. It's all perception and not really an answerable question. 




 I fucking loved this video in drivers ed and can't forget it. 




 That game has been and will remain in my top 5 forever! 




 *Karmanaut* 




 You are Karmanaut 




 I've been using an old piece of paper as a mouse pad for around a year, now. It's worked surprisingly well, so far. 




 This is seriously one of the most difficult questions, ever, for me. 




 It's especially sad because none of them recognized him. 




 All I hear is CITROEEEENN! 




 I'm having great fun with it. I just haven't been able to join any sessions the past 5 days.... 




 Nah, just as fun, though. 




 Because he's fucking good at it! 




 Whoa, there. 




 The seller has been killing everyone that they have sent the camera to and taken a picture. 




 I realize that it's not common at all, but I am currently learning about the stock market in American high school. 




 Oh, I didn't know that. Thanks! 




 I'm a pretty big fan of the Prius plugs on Bones. 




 The closest one is probably the Ruiner and that's pretty loose. 




 Do you have to keep putting cars back into the garage (mainly the 4 car ones)? I've noticed that if I took one out and didn't put it back in or it got destroyed, it would no longer be saved in the garage. This happened 3 times (once in franklin's/aunt's house garage, once in Trevor's 4-car garage, and once in michael's 4-car garage) and I'm wondering if it's a glitch or the game is supposed to be like that. 




 You *know* Rockstar would put that in, too. 




 It is a country, isn't it? 




 As someone who isn't even halfway through, yet.... Oh, my fucking god.  




 I'm pretty sure that's what happens when they grow up in too small a space.

 I don't own a WiiU, but I have a PS3, so prepare for bias. PS3 is awesome. Get one. 




 I consistently fall behind technology-wise and end up moving to new eras a lot slower than all the other civs. I don't really know what to do about it... 




 Because they're actually a communist propaganda manufacturer.

Edit: as well as the letter Z and the number 20. Those are tools of communism. 




 CoD4 has a HUGE PC player base. It is a little more popular if you look for ProMod servers though, which makes the game a little more difficult. 




 Hey! I have one of those, but it's shaped like a deer! 




 Well, he *is* really good at dying. 




 It looks like whoever took this screen cap is missing some models and textures. 




 I think what you're talking about is the guy that kept a journal of everything he did in Skyrim. It actually really helps with immersion if you like writing, at all. 




 You should check it out. It's really good! It's called the Titan EP. 




 Have you heard their new EP? 




 Somebody make a subreddit just for these videos. Now. 




 I thought people liked that movie, am I wrong? I haven't seen it yet, so I don't know any of this. 




 Still haven't seen a show better than these guys. 









 The Unfinished Swan is a really cool indie game. 




 As a teenager, fuck them. 




 I finished that game for the first time since buying it years ago.... And it felt great. 




 Simultaneous isn't bad.  




 I definitely didn't play the third one to see the ending. I really wanted to see how my decisions in the second game affected the third game. 




 Oh, my god. Fuck those guys. 




 I got to have the rare experience that is a wall of death in a 150-200 person venue. It was... Odd, to say the least. 
























 CO is best state!

 It's working. I've fired a gun once in my life and after spending time on reddit, every picture with a gun makes me look if their finger's on the trigger. 




 I don't think I'm responsible enough. :P 




 Someone should make this. 




 I think that's just because Killswitch is a lot more radio friendly than the average metalcore band. Which could be a way that they're the Nickleback of the genre, I guess. 




 Good God, man! Restrain yourself! 




 A longer part would have been hilarious. 




 Oh, my god. I forgot he was in that movie! You're absolutely right! 




 Like the big climbing puzzles to get Altair's armor. Those were badass! 




 Was it really only 60? It felt like it went on for so long! 




 I think he's always been a Christian. He's just being a lot more open about it now. 




 I think it's amazing. You should at least give it a try. 




 I'd think it would be a much more mature Invader Zim, considering that guy wrote IZ. 




 I know it's not a real accent, but that weird shit from After Earth. Like... It's just bad. 




 /r/punk can help you out. They have regular posts about bands from certain countries, genres, etc. 




 It's always been his character. Easy to recognize. 




 It's true, though. Miatas are good cars, but people won't shut up about them. 




 I'm learning about it in school right now. Albeit in an optional class...

 The AmA in question:

 A free doughnut? 




 That's not true. It went April, June, August, October, November. Only that last one actually came in about a month. 




 Isn't that like a tie-in with Flags of Our Fathers? 




 The graphics are actually still fairly good looking.  The game's aged really well.  I feel like, with that in mind, and HD remake would look pretty amazing. 




 Wow, thanks for explaining that. I hope everything gets better, soon. 




 Thanks for answering. That lighting actually sounds really cool! 




 I finally get to one of these early enough and I can't think of a question! I'll just settle with saying that the game looks amazing and I'm excited to see where else it goes! Big fan of Obsidion. Good luck!

Edit: OOH! I thought of some.
What thing about PoE has you most excited?
Also, what would you say is the most unique thing about the game? 




 Yeah... I'm usually not phased by gore, but... I think I'll just leave this one alone. 




 I usually do fine with gore, but I'm afraid to click literally every link in this thread. 




 I'm honestly curious if *this* would make someone cut again or want to stop right then. 




 Tellmewhatstherebecauseimscared 




 Post it. Now. 




 I understand you not liking Thrice's change in style, but personally, I thought they were just as good in the end. Obviously for different reasons, though. 




 Yeah, I liked then until Johnny left. Then it just wasn't the same. 




 I would've told my friend to go fuck himself. That's really shitty that he made you leave because he didnt want to be there.

 Nope 




 It's a famous scream that's heard in a LOT of movies.

 I believe AC4 had an in-game answer about a modern AC. Something along the lines of vehicles not fitting the kind of game they want AC to be. 




 I think he always has the ring, he just doesn't wear it in the real world, where Mal is dead. In the dream world it's back on his finger because Mal is "alive" there. I could be completely wrong, though. 




 Written by the guy that writes the Walking Dead comics, too. 




 Those new-ish automatic shifters (like on the Prius) are the fucking devil at my wash. I've worked there over a year and still can't figure out accessory mode. 




 Only slightly related, but those stupid alarm systems that make the car *HONKHONKHONK* whenever you open or close the doors are ridiculous. 




 "Bless your heart" is the rudest way of saying that they pity you. And it hurts. 




 DAMMIT! DOLLARS, MAN, *DOLLARS!* 




 That whole trilogy is awesome! 




 Fuck, barely anyone remembers it now! 100 years just sounds silly. 




 What the fuck? Why? Those are fucking weird. 




 I was thinking the same about the second. I mean, Jesus... 














 Oh, I see. Thanks! 




 Does anyone know what the difference between part 1 and 2 is going to be? I just want to know so I don't end up buying 2 games when it wouldn't be necessary. Sorry if this is a stupid question.

Edit: words 




 You could always just grab Deadpool Classic. Or I started with Merc With a Mouth, which is an amazing collection. 




 It *was* short, but I had fun and that's all that matters. 




 Jack. 




 Despite them obviously going against the canon, I think this game still looks pretty good. As a fan of both the books and the movies, I'm kind of excited for this. 




 I always just assumed they were really sturdy clothes lines in AC. 




 It is. If people don't specify, I just assume its american unless I see a flag or something. 




 I'm not really sure if I'm using the right words, but I meant like of they're doing it to make fun of themselves or something else. 




 Not if it's self aware. 




 It felt like a bag of sand. 




 FO3 and NV as well. 




 I've had the memorized for all Bethesda games since Oblivion. 




 Well, to have a subreddit about the lack of belief in something makes no sense. It's the same as having a subreddit for people who don't like the color blue or don't use Netflix. An anti circle jerk is pretty likely for such a pointless idea. I don't feel superior, I just think that the idea is ridiculous. 




 I think the worst ones are fucking seasonal achievements that you can only get at one point of the year it was put on and then never again. 




 Mine, too. It took forever to delete so I went to turn the TV off and let it do its thing, but turned the Playstation off without thinking. The file got corrupted and promptly took 2.5 hours to delete. 




 *That's* it! You're right. I guess, now, the question is, what does it do to you? 




 Why does that name sound so nasty? 




 Uhhhh, Suzuki X-90, brah! 




 I mean for more games. There just aren't enough on it, at the moment. 




 Dominic Robilliard, previous experience: creative director of an unreleased game with excessive amounts of hype. 




 I agree. I wish I'd waited a little for more games to come out. All I've used my PS4 for lately is Bluray, Netflix, and ACIV. Other than that, it's all PS3 and PC. 




 I organize them by genre (not very well, either), but I like the idea of "not completed," "completed," etc. I might switch to that. 




 I see a dog. 




 That's my favorite model of the STI. I think I just like cars that are a bit more square, I don't know. 




 The SX4 automatic has AWD as well. 




 I think you're replying to the wrong guy. I was just pointing out that 300 was based on a comic book. Looking back on it, I'm not sure if it really added to the argument or anything because the comic book is based on history, but is extremely fictitious. 




 The photo description says that it was also simultaneously stinging him. 




 I just saw you guys with ABR. I'm totally going again. 




 Yeah. Not everybody has the same taste. 




 My two favorite indie games, by far. 




 Yes, but 300 was based on a graphic novel that doesn't claim to be accurate in any way. 




 I agree. I just can't get into it. 




 Jesus, deep water terrifies me. 
























 At the end of last year in place of the ever popular Hchste Kaiser's Word, there was a live showing of the execution of the show's news team. Before the execution, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 explained to the people that the news team was being punished after the discovery that they were stealing classified information and supplying it to the terrorist group currently at large and killing Liechtenstein's citizens. The execution was done by pistol and carried out personally by the nation's leader. After the execution he stated that betrayal to the country in any form will not be tolerated. 




 At this point just asking would be more unique than anything else. 




 Jesus, for a second I thought he was. 




 Well I feel silly. I meant to add something to the post before submitting it. 




 Liechtenstein is doing nothing. We had no property in space. 

In other news, the terrorist cell currently attacking unarmed civilians and government buildings has begun spreading its demands across the Internet. They are calling for a stop to the construction of the Wall and reopening of the nation's borders. The group claims to be making these demands in order to stop what they foresee to be a rapid downfall in the country's economy that they fear will have a large and irreparable effect on Liechtenstein's people. The still nameless group had threatened to continue the attacks until their demands are met. Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has yet to make a public acknowledgement to the terrorists' demands.

Edit: forgot stuff 




 Liechtenstein welcomes you. We have sent a fruit bouquet in hopes of peaceful relations from now on. 




 Yeah, the Ajax near my house is selling a couple really cheap. 




 "Stay out."

~Hchste Kaiser, /u/test_subject7429 




 Liechtenstein wishes for a public execution competition. 




 Fucking do it 




 Our ancestors were right. We'll protect this secret with our lives. 




 Aw man. Well, thanks for letting me know. 




 Hchste Kaiser will attend your silly convention. 




 If you could please clear the confusion on the shape of the Earth, Liechtenstein would be most appreciative.

 When I last saw them Caleb had disappeared into the crowd and someone from the crowd got on stage and finished I Have A Problem. It was pretty great. 




 I've seen them twice now and let me just say that they are the only opening band I've ever seen with so much enthusiasm. They got the entire room moshing. It was fantastic. 




 No problem. I'll wait. My bad. 




 We'd love to continue the service. 




 Liechtenstein might be willing to pay for Sealand's mail service to continue of it's in Great Britain's best interests. 




 Thanks for looking out for me ;) 




 [Meta] Thanks! [Meta] 




 [Meta] Yeah, I'm just having fun with this. And of course, if it ever becomes a nuisance, I'll set her free. 




 Liechtenstein would like to send diplomats to the micro nation of Sealand to discuss annexation as a strategic base. Since its leadership has gone quiet for over a year since claiming the territory, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 assumes that it is now open to new leadership and, because of it's size, wouldn't count as a full country in regards to annexation. 

Liechtenstein withdraws its attempted negotiations with Austria for annexation of one of its territories. 




 Liechtenstein is willing to send SHIT squads to help with the relief efforts. They're trained for all manner of emergency situations beyond just combat. 




 In the last couple of months there have been three more terrorist explosive attacks. One on a military training facility and two in busy public areas. Liechtenstein's original ideas on the size of this group are either too small or the group is in much deeper than the government originally anticipated. Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has dispatched multiple SHIT squads and even sent some private agents to various areas to investigate these attacks. 

The entire country's militarization has had little affect on the terrorist attacks as they have all been carried out by lone men and been swift and without warning. 

Hchste Kaiser has voiced his outrage at the terrorists' willingness to harm unarmed civilians and directly disrespect his own rule over the country. He has stated that he will not stop until the group's leader and all of its members are killed or captured and that he is willing to take drastic measures to do so.  




 I was on a tricycle and a friend and I were rolling down a neighbor's driveway into another neighbor's lawn to slow down. Long story short, my shitty trike was nothing on her Big Wheel and I had no helmet. The grass didn't slow me down enough and the front wheel hit a rock. I flipped over the handle bars and hit my head on the rock and blacked out. Then I saw one of my neighbors running toward me yelling my name. Blacked out. Blood on the sidewalk. Blacked out. My front door. Blacked out. Then it was the next day. Tricycles make me nervous now. 




 Beautiful 




 Our eternal leader, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has named the bass guitar the national animal of Liechtenstein. They are now government protected creatures under the guidelines set by the newly passed Godly Rythm Act of 2020. All citizens will treat bass guitars from here on out with reverence, love, and the utmost respect or risk public execution. That is all. 




 Liechtenstein has sent a fruit bouquet as a welcome back gift. Just know that they aren't  actual flowers, but fruit under the guise if flowers. We hope you enjoy the fruit man's ruse. 




 I live here and didn't know that! 




 (I was busy yesterday)

Hchste Kaiser's third year as the supreme general of our great nation has been quite eventful. An attempted terrorist attack took place at the capital building while Hchste Kaiser was meeting with all of his officials. Luckily, the explosive malfunctioned and wasn't able to detonate. Turkey was able to supply intelligence that told us that this isn't a single man's idea, but a group effort. The terrorist is still being interrogated for information.

On a brighter side, our great leader recently started a new program for the military elite. The SHIT program will include the best if the best soldiers from both Liechtenstein and France. These SHIT Squads will be used as Hchste Kaiser's personal guard and in missions considered to dangerous for the average soldier or police officer. Hopefully, once the program releases the first groups from training, a terrorist attack like the one mentioned will become much more difficult to execute.

In more recent news, our wonderful leader sent delegates to the Vorarlberg region of Austria to negotiate an annexation. If Austria's own annexation of another area comes to fruition, then Vorarlberg may well become the newest addition to our great nation. These negotiations also led to an alliance between the two countries.

In other news, the construction of the Wall is going as planned, but, sadly, the **subway station's** construction has been haulted until further notice. And finally, Texas finally gave Hchste Kaiser his money back. When asked about the country's new leader, /u/test_subject7429's only response was, "Who? Oh, s***! I'm late for my banjo lessons. Get out!"

This concludes your only choice in yearly news. We thank you for choosing Hchste Kaiser's Word, even though you have no other option.

 Batman   Robin isn't the worst movie. It's just really, really bad. 




 Excellent! Good luck, for both of our sake! 




 We think that would be a great idea. 




 Whatever you choose, Liechtenstein respects the decision. 




 Thanks for considering. We understand if you'd like to keep the land. 




 Liechtenstein would be willing to donate $10B to help with the project. We are also willing to help train pilots and design weapons systems for the ships if needed. 




 Hchste Kaiser wishes to expand, fearing that the small size if our already great nation is a weakness. If Vorarlberg will allow it, we will welcome them into our arms as a new addition to our country. 




 This information is concerning. Thank you for sharing this. 




 Liechtenstein is interested in helping with this project, if you'll have us.

 Recently there was an attempt on the Hchste Kaiser's life. During a meeting with his parliament, a large car rammed itself through the front doors of the building and the driver attempted to detonate an explosive in the vehicle. Thankfully, the explosive didn't detonate and the bomber was captured. He is currently in custody and being questioned. Hopefully this was an individual attack and not a group effort. Any information will be extremely appreciated.  




 Liechtenstein would be honored to have France's legendary soldiers take part in the SHIT program. 




 Today, our great nation begins a program that will not only ensure our land's protection, but help efforts all over the world. This day marks the beginning of the Special Hunt and Infiltrate Trooper training program for the country's most elite military personnel. This elite team of soldiers will have the newest in prototype military technology and have the best training the country can offer. This is a great step forward for Liechtenstein's military and a great day for our country! 

Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 




 Hchste Kaiser will make an appearance. The yeti menace has terrorized the great nation of Liechtenstein for far too long. 




 I'm a a pretty big fan of Mike Litoris, myself. 




 I completely agree with you. I don't know what it is, but I find that the more affordable cars are a lot more interesting. 




 I wish they'd had the other characters you'd unlocked around the city fighting crime or something. That would've been badass. 




 With the return of Liechtenstein's money, the construction of the Great Wall of Liechtenstein will begin as planned in January of next year. However, without the help of the former dictator of Texas, a completion date is still unknown. But do not worry, people.  The continuity of this great nation is still of utmost importance to me.

Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 




 Thank you very much. 




 Return Liechtenstein's money and I will consider making an appearance at your silly concert. 




 Does Matt Greiner play guitar? 




 This year has been a stressful one for the great leader of Liechtenstein. The panic cause by the meteorite impact in Northern Africa forced Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 to close the border to all but the most important persons and events. Despite the crisis being solved, the leader remains cautious and has yet to reopen the borders to the rest of the world.

In other news, a **subway system** began construction. Everyone is extremely excited for the **subway** and hopes to be able to **travel the country quickly and in comfort** soon. Sadly the **subway** does not yet have a definite completion date, but stay tuned! 
(*Disclaimer*: **subway system** is definitely **not** a military bunker.)

On the topic of construction, the leader of our great nation also began construction of the Great Wall of Liechtenstein. This wall will surround the entire country and be fully armed with soldiers, artillery, etc. Sadly, did to the recent change in leadership in Texas, the previously expected help in building the wall seems to no longer be the case. This unexpected delay has caused this project, too, to no longer have an expected completion date.

On a related note, Hchste Kaiser expects Texas to, "Give me my money back. Like, now, guys. I mean... Come on."

Lastly, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has named the raspberry as Liechtenstein's national fruit. All citizens are now required to consume at least one raspberry every 6 hours in accordance with the laws set by the recently passed Freaking Delicious Act of 2018.

This concludes your once a year news source Hchste Kaiser's Word. Tune in next year for your only choice in Liechtenstein news!

Stay tuned for Sing-Along Disney Songs with Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 




 Why have I seen this same story in different formats so much these last couple of weeks? 




 Due to the recent change in leadership in Texas and unrealistically enthusiastic deadlines by our great leader, the **subway** that was planned no longer has a definite completion date. We **apologise to the citizens** and **hope they will be able to ride the rails** sooner than later.

Hchste Kaiser's Minister for Expansion 




 Yeah, that was just me being enthusiastic more than anything. It'll definitely be a while. 




 Either Notch or Lived a Lie by Codec 




 Oh, it definitely is **legit**. 




 Liechtenstein has begun construction of an underground **subway.** This amazing **transportation system** will run throughout the entire country and **be able to transport the citizens of Liechtenstein all over the country**! This is **in no way** a military base or a vault or anything of the sort! As a sneak peak, I am willing to say that the new **subways** will feature extremely large 3 ft thick gates that will stand around 20 ft high and be able to be withstand even the most powerful of **train collisions**! Isn't that fantastic? The **subway system** will also be going hundreds of feet below ground with multiple levels to **allow for more trains and routes**! Wow! To give you people an idea about the size, it may or may not be able to hold the majority if not all of the citizens of Liechtenstein in the event of a great **celebration** so everyone will be able to **party together**! Amazing! We anticipate that this **subway system** will be complete in a matter of 3-4 years and then **everyone** will be **allowed** to **ride the trains all over the country**!

 Liechtenstein 




 Holy shit. The fez thing. I know someone that wears one every day.  




 Ohmigawd you guys so I was on tumblr and everything they said even the stupid way they type without punctuation as if they were yelling and never taking a breath is just crazy and I'm literally dyING YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW 




 That has to be one of the shortest ever. I swear it lasted all of 3 days. 




 Wonderful. I've sent the funds. 




 Sir, you have your self a deal. Maybe we can even go one step further... And build both. 




 Preposterous. I won't pay a penny over $98M 




 Hmm, how large of a fee? 




 After reports of a multitude of people secretly entering the great nation of Liechtenstein despite the heavily enforced closed border rulings, I have decided that in order to keep the peace and integrity and ensure the defense and safety of this perfect nation and its citizens, a barrier must be built. The wall will stand 50 feet tall, be heavily defended, and surround the entire nation. This decision is not one made easily, but must happen in order to ensure the safety of my nation and its people in these unpredictable times. 

Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429 




 Social experiment? 




 Well... That's awkward because he's... Ah... Dead. 




 The newest leader of the great nation of Liechtenstein began his eternal term this year rather successfully. He was able to bring the country's military strength up well over what was necessary. When questioned, the Hchste Kaiser responded, "What the hell does 'moderation' mean?" The nation's great leader was then given a dictionary and, upon reading the definition, had the reporter publicly executed.

As of now, the nation's borders are still closed due to the bacterial crisis in Africa and will only be opened for reasons of the utmost importance.

In other news, the Hchste Kaiser has said that he won't nor will he ever recognize Duck Rights.

That's all for now, but tune in next year for Hchste Kaiser's Word. You're only choice in Liechtenstein national news.

 All travel into Liechtenstein is hereby suspended indefinitely. Only people with top clearance will be allowed across the border and only when it is absolutely essential that they be allowed into the country. 

Liechtenstein also offers financial aide to help with researching/combating the new bacteria. 




 ~Signed Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 




 Liechtenstein would be happy to join
~Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 




 If you could change that, I would be forever grateful. 




 Awesome. Thanks! 




 How's "Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein"? 




 Lichtenstein wholeheartedly accepts the offer! 




 Lichtenstein hopes the parties are fantastic. 




 Lichtenstein offers a party planner instead. 




 Liechtenstein hopes you understand. 




 From here and on, all citizens 16 and older will receive basic military training in preparation for any evident military threats against this great nation.

Liederstein Froogle 




 The country of Liechtenstein thanks you and in return would like to send a shipment of posters depicting the Alps (36"x12"/91.5cm x30cm). We hope this is the start if a wonderful friendship. 




 Actually, I'm really sorry if you already did it, but

Hchste Allgemeinen fr die Ewigkeit

Would be nice.

Edit: I'm perfectly happy if you can't/don't want to. 




 Are they bright? 









 All glory to Supreme Liederstein! 




 Honestly, there's always seemed to be this huge anti religion thing in the genre. And it's a little weird. 




 There's a whole sub if you didn't know!
/r/reclaimedbynature sadly it doesn't seem to be very active at this time. 




 You guys are so cute together!
