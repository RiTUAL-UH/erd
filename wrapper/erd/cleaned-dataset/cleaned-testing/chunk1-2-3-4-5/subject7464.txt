 Can neither confirm or debunk what you said, but the table in [this article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_Chinese_surnames) might be useful... 
























 Came across [this woman's account of her attack](http://dayre.me/davienne/pLKsQpVoUr). She's also a young Singaporean in he mid-twenties and similarly, her attacker was a cyclist that came across her on a walkway at night.

Thanks for sharing your experience. Reading both of your accounts has reminded me that I should not take it for granted that Singapore is a relatively safe place. Heck, i walk home past midnight along dimly-lit walkways quite often without batting an eyelid. Not sure if I'd dare to do so anymore.  
























  Don't pursue her through texts, use texts to arrange meet ups. Texts can easily be misinterpreted and not to your advantage.

I'm a girl and cannot agree more with this. I personally don't like texting someone I barely know at length and many of my friends feel the same way. Face-to-face is the way to go!  
























 Well if they already like you right off the bat then that's all good, text away all you like. :) I can't speak for all girls, but I seldom ever like a guy right from the start to feel comfortable enough texting them at length before we've gone on a couple of dates and have gotten to know each other better.  

Also, I find that certain nuances in speech get lost in text messages so if you don't know each other well enough yet, some of the stuff you're trying to say won't come across to her the way you meant it, and vice versa. 
























  Why has none of his children being chosen to be groomed ? 

Good question, I've just realised that I don't even know who his children are! Are they even in public service?
