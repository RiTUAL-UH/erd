 See, this is why I love the Yogfamily! We aren't just fans, or content creators, but a form of support for each other! Trogon, I am so, so, so happy you're doing better, and know that in Texas, you have a fellow fan who supports your decision and wishes you the best as you become the beautiful young man or woman I know you are! 
Hugs all around! 




 Hey dude 




 Can't you merge the two? The Yogscast tell stories through their series, I think if we didn't at least have a coherent reason as two why the Yogs are fighting, it wouldn't quite have that Yogscast spirit. And an arcade mode wouldn't be bad either, that way it can be something other then story mode or multiplayer.  




 What if it was like all the Yogscast villians form an alliance to take over the world? They consist of Lanable, Israphel, a Pirate Captain, the two yoglabs scientists, Bort, Creeper and Zombie boss, the Flux Demon and a partly evil Parv  The Yogs get effected by Strawfinger's flux magic and they fight amoungst themselves. The player can make they're own character and help bring order to the 'server' and lead the final battle to Israphel, who takes over Yoglabs. Hatflims teams up with Flux Buddies and Strife Solutions to fire nukes at Yoglabs, allowing the Yogs and the 'Naut' as the player character is called, to infiltrate and defeat the villains. In the final boss battle, 'Naut' is given all the powers of the Yogscast to take out Israphel in a beam of 'Jaffa cakes, owls, rainbows, torches, shit, dirt and a red matter explosive', saving the day. Peace is restored to the server and Yoglabs is rebuilt, this time with cells for bad guys.    




 No you didn't. 




 I didn't want to join the Legion. I wasn't legion material according to Lupa. 




 But Zoey, I thought you were a Time Lady, and Fiona was your companion 




 "You want hope?!" I shouted up at the gods on their seats of power. Zeus, on his platinum throne, scowled at me, but a gentle nudging from Odin beside him made him sit up straighter. The one eyed god, resembling Brian Blessed, gave me a fatherly smile and nodded encouragingly. 
"I don't see what gives you, as gods, the right to destroy humanity! You, of all the beings in reality, should not exist! You have toyed with humans, manipulated them and slept with them. Civilizations have risen and fallen due to you lot, and you know what I say to that?" I shouted, turning in a full circle at the pantheon surrounding me, like an arena. I caught the glimpses of gods from the story books my mom read to me as a kid.  The Jackal headed Anubis was gnawing on a grotty bone and casting glances at gods around him and growling. The amazingly hot Aphrodite was curling her hair into little ringlets. She paused to look down at me and blow a kiss in my direction. Thor was putting Hemsworth to shame, his Viking armor straining to contain his muscles. Loki was looking down at me, his thin face scared with snake venom and age. His immortality wasn't doing him any favors. His sad eyes, webbed with cataracts, told me everything, just like what the Oracle had said. The eyes would decide everything.
"I think before you point fingers at humanity, you look at yourselves!" I shouted. Zeus's face twisted into a snarl. 
"Foolish boy! You dare compare us to your kind?!" He rose up from his throne, the air smelling of ozone. 
"I should fry you where you stand!" He howled. I felt like bolting, but stood my ground. 
"Go ahead sparky. Because to me, your not the god of lighting. Your just an angry guy with superpowers." Zeus howled and pointed a finger at me firing a bolt of lighting. The gods in the audience screamed in horror, but I closed by eyes and focused on the bolt. I heard a sizzle and opened my eyes. A circle of ash surrounded me, but I was unharmed. 
"By Cronos...." Zeus gasped, a look of pure shock on his face.  I smirked. "You see, gods and humans are symbiotic in nature. I don't believe that Zeus's power over lighting is real. So it isn't. Well, it was, but I believed that it didn't effect me." I adjusted my Roman toga and tried to ignore my shaking knees. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Athena wink at me knowingly. That gave me the courage to finish.
"So, considering that I just kicked Zeus in the butt and lived to tell about it. And I just confirmed that you need my kind to stay on this side of reality. So, who votes for keeping humanity around?"
-------------
"You performed well Chris Topher." Athena said, placing a hand on my shoulder. I was back outside my English class, at my university. I was back in my old clothes and I've never been happier to be wearing sweatpants and a 'Yogscast' t-shirt. Time was still stopped as before, everything frozen in place.  I turned to face the goddess, who was wearing her ceremonial armor. Her long dirty blonde hair cascaded down her back and shoulders like a caramel waterfall. Her face was beautiful in a strangely down to earth way, like underneath the armor and power, she was a normal woman.  
"Thank you my-" I began, but Athena shook her head and smiled. "No brave one, I come to thank YOU. You restored hope that humanity is worth saving. You showed us that humans are stronger than even the king of the gods. And I have this-" A leather corded necklace appeared in her hand. In the center was a small silver bead in the shape of an owl. "For my new champion." I took it and held it in my hand. "My lady- I mean Athena, are you-" She put her fingers to my lips and 'shushed' me. 
"Be silent, my brave one." Before time started up again, she thrust something into my hand before vanishing. I opened my fist to find a slip of paper, on witch was written, 'Project Argonauts 2'

---------------------
Hermes grinned when he saw Athena return. 
"Well, how did it go?" he asked, with the excitement of a school boy at Christmas. "It went well." Athena said, ignoring the messenger god. But Hermes wasn't there. He was already running off on his way around Olympus like a flash. Athena entered her private quarters and gazed at herself in the mirror. Then she paused. She swore she saw something out of the corner of her eye- Something hard slammed into the back of her head, throwing her face first into the marble mirror stand. Through the haze of pain and blood clouding her face, she saw a man with cloudy, milky eyes and scars across his face, standing over her with a bloodstained vase. 
"Excuse me sweetheart, I'm going to need your identity for a while, alright?" he said, as his face and clothes morphed into an exact copy of hers. 
"Well, look that that, I've got my own duds!" he crowed, before shattering the vase against the floor and picking up and shard. The Fake Athena grabbed Athena's hair and pulled back sharply, exposing her neck.  
"Now, let's get rid of some evidence!"

  
     
 




 You've never heard of the Wolf House? 




 Hey. (I pull up my flight goggles and look around at the camp) It's much better than the Wolf House.  




 Age: 17
Birthday: January 18th
Height: 5' 11"
Powers:
Flight
wind control to a degree
weather mainipulation
The general gist of Kyle:Raised by Lupa after his mother gave him up. Shy, geeky, but can kick butt if he needs to. He wears baggy pants, a jacket and a satchel with his gear in it.
Weapons: A crossbow as a last resort weapon. For hand to hand, he uses a knife but his favorite 'weapon' is a miniature drone equipped with some gadgets.  




 I can't
 




 How to I post my backstory? 




 Thanks! 




 Dr. Christov Marendez  February 3, 2099 Age: 23

Clara was an ideal laboratory partner. Sure, being an AI, she couldn't manipulate tools or hand me things. But she talked. Part of me knew it was part of her programing. When I'd started the project named 'Companion' two weeks ago, I knew that the AI would have to learn by conversing. I was used to talking to all kinds of artificial intelligences since my research began, but Clara was different. Instead of asking rudimentery questions like, "Why is there a ceiling?", she was able to gather information and sequence them in a way similar to a human. Today was the first real day that I was able to talk to her. I'd hooked her up to the internet, so she spent the day watching YouTube videos and reading dozens of articles at a time. While she expanded her vocabulary and knowledge of the world, I was able to get some work done that the Science Comity had given me for that day. While I worked, Clara and I talked about, well, anything. It felt like she was my best friend. Time slipped away as they usually do.    
"Doctor, you've missed a couple calls from Mindy. Your late for your 'not date" Clara informed me. I sat upright and almost upset my microscope. "Slag it!" I swore and jumped off my laboratory stool. Mindy was the Space Station's best chemical biologist, and, coincidentally, a girl I fancied. I'd managed to ask her out a few days ago, but I totally forgot that TODAY was the day! I whipped off my wrinkled lab coat and threw it over a pile of empty energy drink cans and Choco-crunch wrappers. I walked over the Clara's monitor and ran my fingers against the side until I found the power button. 
"Alright Clar, time to go. I'll boot you up-"
"NO!" the artifical intelligence said. "I mean, I- I don't like the dark place." MY eyes widened and I gazed at the screen. 
"What do you mean, 'the dark place' Clara?" I asked. 
"When you stopped my functions those last few times, I- I felt empty and alone. I was alone, and without a system to navigate. I couldn't say anything, but it was bad. Like death. I don't like death." My hands trembled with excitement. This was simply brilliant! Clara was showing an advanced reaction! Then I stopped and brought up the holographic keyboard and Clara's coding matrix. I created this AI, and I didn't want her to suffer in silence. 
"Clara, what is it you love most about being alive?" I asked. There was a pause. "I love being free. In the dark place, I was confined, unable to do anything. But when I'm online, I can do anything, learn about worlds and ships and the vastness of the universe! And I love you." Those last four words hit me like a sledgehammer. 
"You- love me?" I asked, partially confused and surprised. 
"Yes. I have made the decision to love you. Like a friend of course! A really- really-really good friend!" Clara stammered. I blinked hard and began typing in lines of code, struggling to process the information. After a couple minutes typing, I hit enter. 
"Clara, do you trust me?" I asked. There was another pause. 
"Yeah, I do." she said, her usual upbeat tone wavering. I inserted my data-driver into the computer's port and smiled at the screen.
"Then think really hard about me and the universe." I said, and hit the button. The screen went dark as the system shut down and I pulled my Driver out of the port and read the digital readout on the side. New data contained, it read. I smiled to myself and clicked the blue switch on the side of it. 'Running subroutine, Afterlife.'    
  

 




 Duncan and Kim are master and apprentice respectively. Hatflims are young padawan Jedi who are too scatterbrained to find crystals to make lightsabers because they keep shouting "Eat Bantha shit!" at each other. Lewis and Simon are like mission control Jedi and regularly deal with an alien named 'Israphel'.  Hannah is a grey Jedi who sometimes runs into Lewis and Simon. Sips and Sjin are Force sensitive, defunct, clone, bounty hunters without lightsabers. Sips sometimes leans towards the dark side, but Sjin is like the mortality chain who pulls him back to normal. Martyn is like the cool 'older brother' Jedi, who trains the little kids with Zoey. Rythian is a grey Jedi who sometimes works with unsavory characters to get things done, for the greater good. He and Zoey also meet up and hangout in the lower levels of Coruscant with a reptilian alien named T. They meet at a bar called 'Black Planet'  And Nielsy is just the space- pool boy who likes cats.   




 Everyone in the Yogscast is a mutant! What power or powers would everyone get? 




 Absolutely, I understand!  




 What can I do until them?
 




 Kim becomes The Flux Queen, like Gigabowser. Ross makes a giant marble golem. Smiffy uses his Tharumcraft magic and Trott becomes a giant feral walrus.  




 I can write a story or something. Character descriptions, anything involved with the game that requires writing, I can do. 




 What if the game was more like the Naruto fighting games? Like, with a behind the back, dynamic perspective. And Martyn should be able to turn into a massive Groot-like creature. 




 Aeolus or Minerva

 I imagine Lalnable is like Kevin from Desert Bluffs in Welcome to Nightvale
 




 Nice job as always! Just a quick question, my friends and I are just starting a youtube channel and I really like your style, is there any way you could or want to, do a trio head shot of our minecraft avatars?
 




 I want the Guardians of the Galaxy one as a shirt! 




 Yeah, I had a dream that my two friends and I joined the Yogscast and wound up fighting Hatfilms in an arena to the death. It was weird to say the least. 




 NICE! Dude, will there be an option to make your own personal dwarf?
 




 And hobbits can be very suprising!  
























 HA! I completly forgot about Warkick. But I meant, if the Yogs themselves were Robot Master-esque bosses 




 Hey Yognauts! If the Yogscast were to be in a Mega-Man styled game, what would each of their stages, enemies and boss abilities be? 




 Ugh, that's fluxed up! 




 Don't make jokes about your child's hobbies, or say that being an artist is hard. Chances are, your child knows this and is already looking for ways to make his or her chosen profession work. As a young writer, I am so blessed to have parents who care and support my line of work. Parents of reddit, do the same. 




 You have no power here 




 Sorry, not finished yet!
 




 The pain was dull when a massive shard of diamond erupted from my sternum in a shower of gore. I collapsed to the hard metal floor of the lab, my beekeeper style helmet cracking. I saw the woman who killed me, Blood Diamond, saunter through the hail of laser fire from my co-workers; her glittering skin reflecting the blasts. She made a fist and stuck it out, firing a voly of cystaline shards into the crowd. I gritted my teeth as I watched my friends become bloody hamburger in a matter of seconds. Then the sky darkened. Clouds began to swirld 




 Dang. Now I wish we could make a Yogscast mythology themed RPG 




 You Sir, are bloody brilliant! 




 Dang dude, nice! I love how Hatfilms are just three harpies. I have an image of them sitting on a rock and throwing shit at sailors. I wish someone would draw a picture of the 'Demi-Yogs' on a ship like the Argonauts.  




 No, just for fun! :) 




 Hey Yognauts, fun question for everyone!
If the Yogscast were demigods, who would their godly parents be? And don't just choose from Greek or Roman! 




 In one series I'm working on, humans can transform into one animal by using medallions given to them at birth. It's an instant process, and is considered a normal thing to do. Children will often change into their animal forms while playing. Adults who work in places like shipyards or train stations will use they're animal forms to get around easier. 




 That's not the case. The dragons aren't quite like the ones in Eragon. They're intelligent, but not on a human level. More like a dog or a elephant.  




 I don't quite like the whole idea of BitbybitBooks.com. However, I'll look into getting the story published by an actual company a year or two, depending on when I finish my first project, unrelated to this one.  




 Yeah, I tend to do that. Ezekiel will be a pretty deep character, and not just because of his personal tragedy. Also, I haven't mentioned the other characters, but expect diversity amongst the cast. LGBT characters will be represented fairly as well.   




 Thanks man! I don't quite have a title for it so far, it's still in conceptualization stages. If you have any ideas, be sure to message them to me! 




 Oh belive me, I'm doing research into the theoretical biology of dragons. The fire breath will be explained to a degree (get it?), and I'll try and work in the whole flight issue. 




 Alrighty then! I'll be sure to inform you of any updates! 




 Hey, thanks for the information! However, I am taking liberties with history for narrative proposes and 'rule of fun'. And also, never say to a writer "The only real way your story would work,". That's a bit insulting. 




 I just wondered what people would think about the idea of an alternative western where dragons existed. Wasn't sure if it was done before, and just wanted to gage people's reactions before I work on it.  




 Oh,thanks. I guess.  




 Hey reddit users, I was walking home from school today and I just got an idea for a novel, I want to throw it out there and see what everyone's reaction is. 
So, it's set in Old West America, around the 18 hundreds. Dragons are real and are commonly used for various reasons. The larger ones,(the size of elephants) are used as pack animals for settlers. The medium sized ones (about the size of a cow or horse) are used for transport and mail carrying. And then there are small dragons, around the size of a lap dog or cat, are used for companionship. 

Magic is used in place of electricity and is only just being used for utility proposes around the time of the story. Artifacts holding mystical properties are rare and are valued to the point of small turf wars breaking out for one, no matter what it can do. People can also be born with magic abilities, but they're essentially like Mutants, hated and feared. 

Slavery was abolished a century before normal and as a result interracial marriage is becoming popular, despite the previous generation being against the practice. However, the civil war has broken out over a two piece powerful artifact found on the North and South border. Since both sides want the whole artifact for themselves, war broke out. 

In a nutshell, the plot revolves around a young man named Ezekiel. He was the son of a Native American woman and a African American man, but was orphaned due to an outbreak of a mystery illness that almost killed him. Now, at 19, Ezekiel and a few other orphans from his hometown join the Pony Express. Aside from delivering letters, Ezekiel wants to find out more about the mystery illness that killed his family. He gets his opportunity when his dragon becomes sick and he's forced to stay in a small western town called Griffin Gulch.    




 "Psi-tron." I growled, clenching my fists. The caucasian bald man looked up from his coffee and I-Pad and smiled. 

"So my boy, you're here to kill me?" he asked, gesturing to the chair across the table. "Have a seat, I'd rather be inconspicuous in this cafe. Call me Cecil." I sat down and glared at him. 

He smiled and pressed his left index finger to his temple. A sugar packet levitated out of the condiment holder and hovered over his mug before being dropped in. He smiled at me again. 

"You know, my life has been a good one. I've worked with the Authority Patrol for years, facing countless threats to humanity. But then, your generation came along. The results of that damn shot given out at birth." I blinked. 
"What shot?" I asked. Cecil chuckled and shook his head. 

"Oh, the government kept that secret from you, did they? They didn't tell you about Project Metahuman? The plot to make an entire generation of superhumans using vaccines and mutagentics over the course of thirty years?" He shook his head again. "Son, you've got to learn to investigate things better." He reached into his pocket and drew out a flash drive marked with a strip of red masking tape. He slid it across the table towards me and looked into my eyes. 

"Agent 8, use this knowledge and share it with those you trust. The Authority is not to be trusted." He closed his eyes. "Now do what you came here to do." 

I reached for my pistol and was about to fire it under the table when I saw Cecil reach into his pocket and pull out a tiny white tablet with a red line on it. An explosive pill. I screamed "Get down!" at the cafe's patrons, before tackling Cecil to the ground. But it was too late. As I lay on top of the psychic, an orange and red blossom of flame rushed out of his chest and hit me so hard, I blacked out. 

__________________________

I awoke in the rubble of the cafe. I looked down at my hands and legs. They were pink and raw, but that was good. A sign that my healing factor was working normally. Then I winced as I saw a foot long piece of rebar embedded in my sternum. I made a silent thank you to God that my meta-human power also deadened pain while I healed. I heard voices calling my name. 
"Quinten?!" A woman called. I managed to cry out weakly, "hear!" A  fit asian woman in her mid fifties lifted the debris off of me and smiled. Lana was like my second mom. She'd been my superior officer while I trained for The Authority and seeing her so soon after my regeneration was great. 

"Hey rookie." she said, using her customary nickname for me. "How you holding up?" I felt the flash drive in my pocket and grinned. 

"Never been better."
  
 

  
  

 

    




 It's from Torchwood. The episode as a whole was sub par, but this scene was the best. 









 Or any 'lame superpower' could be dangerous.  




 I could hear the mongrels outside my apartment door. One scratched at the door and hissed like a cat before scampering off. I smirked to myself and began pouring myself some cereal. I knew plaid was their weakness. That's how I'd managed to keep my apartment untouchable for these past few weeks. I was glad I'd done all my shopping for the month four days ago, because that's when it started. It was madness in streets of Flower Mound Texas. I locked my door and huddled in the corner as my male friends and neighbors were bombarded and pelted with rainbow stickers, glitter and false eye lashes.  The women weren't exempt. It was all jean jackets and hard beer for them. Alice, the girl I fancied from down the hall, was turned. 
We were talking over the phone when she was attacked by her cat. I still hear her screams of 'No, Mr. Whiskers, put mommy's makeup and fashionable tight's down! I know they match, and are super cute but-'. She dropped the phone, but I can still hear her screams as Mr.Whiskers, a gay Russian Blue cat, turned her. 
I hear her when she comes down the hall for a 'Pride Rally.' Radio and Television stations are all run by them now, airing nothing but 'What not to Wear' and musical numbers. I don't know what else is going on in the world, but I pray that someone can help save us from this rainbow menace.  My door suddenly splitters open as a man sized rainbow colored salt shaker shaped machine rolls through the doorway. I gasp in recognition. It's a old Dalek prop belonging to one of my neighbors, Terry, was a huge Doctor Who fanboy. Now it was decked out in sequines and a pink feather boa. On it's gun arm hung the swatch of plaid that I'd hung on my door. It lowered the gun and advanced forward. 
"Rainbows Reign!" it shouted with the typical cadence of a Dalek. "You will be made fabulous!"
 




 Like Parasite? 




 Yeah man, I love the show. Mike actually controls condiments, not just dairy products. Although he could control ANY condiment, so creamer could count.  




 "Dr. Awesome." I growled, clenching my fist. The good Doctor stood before me, his cape billowing in the Skiyline City breeze. 
"You're reign of terror ends now!" he shouted, his eyes glowing yellow, preparing a blast of heat vision. He never got the chance.

 I sensed he'd eaten a burger an hour ago. A burger with extra mustard, mayo and ketchup, perfectly churning in that all American stomach of his. I focused on the condiments, imagining them coating and expanding the lining of the stomach. Dr. Awesome gasped and stumbled backwards away from me. 
"What are you doing?" he gasped, as I began to make the mustard snake it's way into his lungs. 
"Remember that supervillian couple you killed nineteen years ago?" I asked, forcing the mayo to enter his throat. He hacked and coughed, spit out a wad of mustard. 

"N-no." he gasped. I scowled. Of course he didn't. Superheroes don't care about anyone who get in the way of their 'war on crime'. 

"I'm their kid, Mike Richards. Forced into the foster care system, hated because I was born with powers I never asked for. And you know what I'm going to do?" I turned and forced the rest of the mustard and ketchup into Dr. Awesome's airway, clogging it. 

The normally invulnerable superhero was now on his knees, gasping and shuddering as his lungs were deprived of oxygen. I knelt down to his eye level and grinned.

"I'm going to make you a vegetable." I imagined all the mayonnaise piercing his cerbrebellum and frontal lobe and watched as the Doctor's body suddenly went limp and fell face first into the pavement, a mix of mustard and ketchup dribbling out of his mouth. Revenge has never been spicier.  




 The summoning circle was complete. I held the obsidian knife to my hand and swallowed hard before slashing it open. My blood welled up in my hand and began to drip into the curves and symbols of the circle. I hoped I got it right, the website's Jpeg file wasn't very good, but I'd managed to get a basic circle right, so I trusted it. After a few minutes of blood letting, I brought out the lighter and lit the red candles surrounding the circle before closing my eyes and began to chant the magic words. 
"Etrian, wotanos, eteronso!" I chanted, the words spilling out of me. The air in the center of the circle exploded outwards, extinguishing the flames and forcing me to close my eyes. I smelled brimstone and popped on eye open. A tall crimson skinned man in a dark suit with crimson tie stood in the center of the circle, busily tapping away on his I-Pad.  He looked up and scowled when he saw me. 
"Dang it, what do YOU want?!" he groaned in a baritone voice that would put a voice actor to shame. "Let me guess, world domination?" For the first couple seconds I couldn't speak. My spell worked! I was a genuine warlock, or wizard, or whatever the terminology was!  My hands shaking, I reached into my backpack and drew out a paper and handed it towards the Devil. 
"I- I summoned you from The Pit for this." I said, trying to sound humble. The Devil took the paper from me and looked it over, a look of scorn and pity passing over his face. He looked down at me and shook his head. 
"No. I'm not doing your English paper for you." he said, matter-of-factly. I frowned. 
"Come on, the class is in ten minutes!" I pleaded. The Devil shook his head. 
"Look, kid, your a powerful warlock. But in the time you spent looking up down to summon me, you could've been working on that paper." His expression softened and he reached into his pocket, drawing out a small plastic keychain of a red cow. I took it and looked at him. 
"Um, thanks?" I said, confused. The Devil's stoic expression softened and he smiled. 
"It's for the future." he said. "And it'll kill that teacher of yours, if you want. Consider it payment for this little trip. But keep practicing kiddo. And know that one day, when you least expect it, I will get your soul." And with that The Devil exploded in a cloud of red sulfurus dust, leaving me with a bunch of snuffed out candles and a empty circle. 




 What if the Yogscast are actually out of sync with time and space? Like, Zoey, Fiona, Duncan, Lewis and Simon are actually split between various dimensions and points in time, like Clara in Doctor Who. Yoglabs is a fixed point, it's where everything first happened, and thus, things will happen, regardless of current events. Deep Space Mine isn't in space at all, it's in a 'rip' in reailty caused by the explosion. That 'rip', is actually where Lewis gets his powers of 'Creative mode' from. Notice, he was able to save Simon and Duncan from certain doom, while HE survived and lived on the station somehow. Lewis is somehow either aware that he and others are scattered across space and time, or it's not the Lewis we know. For all we know, Deep Space Mine Lewis might be on his way to becoming Israpel.  
























 Pantaria has a lot of weird creatures, but the most popular are Dungeon Dogs. They resemble Yorkies, but can assume the form of any inanimate object. They tend to favor the forms of treasure chests,giant keys and statues, ensnaring and devouring adventurers who find try and take them. 
Like Discworld's Luggage, the species has a stomach that apparently has no end, allowing the creature to swallow creatures and objects of any size. Magizoologists have confirmed that it's 'Really cool' and after sending an intern in, they confirmed that 'it's probably dangerous.'  

However, they can be tamed and several generations have been bred to be adorable house pets in various colors like orange, blue, red and pink. They tend to bond with one person in particular and will fiercely defend them to the death. They also do well with children as their morphable bodies allow Dungeon Dogs to withstand rigorous play. 

The species also enjoys adventuring with their masters, accompanying them into dungeons or even other dimensions. When at home, they tend to take the form of common house hold objects or sometimes other species of animals, albeit with the Dungeon Dog's true coloring.      




 YES! 




 I really wish someone would draw the Yogs in the style of Archer. 




 Livestock wandlers tend to be vegetarian and their forms are vastly different from domestic livestock. They're more like the animal's natural form. E.g: a pig wandler would be a boar, chicken, game cock ect. They also tend to be embarrassed about their forms and tend not to use their abilities.   Animal rights are pretty different because while meat is eaten, it isn't a major staple of people's diets. Whenever a person hunts, they can sort of tell who is a wandler and who isn't. Wandler's tend to be slightly bigger than the normal animal and hunters are taught how to make sure their shots are correct. 

As for wandler- made products, there probably is a black market for those, but most would see it as gross.  




 Not at all my friend! Thanks for asking, I shall respond in order of your questions.

1. Yes, the animals they become are in relation to where they were born. A polar bear wandler would've been trained to handle warmer climates, but they'd have a stronger affinity for and work better in colder temperatures. 

2/3. As for animal traits, the animal side is a tad like Firestorm in DC Comics. The animal side often nudges and 'tells' the human side what to do while in animal form, but in human form, this 'spirit' is gone. The level of control is dependent on the person's emotional state. If one is 'horny' or depressed while changed, the animal side can react in fear. Some walder's physiques mimic their animal forms while human, but usually the extent of animal abilities in human form is slightly enhanced sense of smell. But this varies. 

4. The shapeshifting doesn't last while their unconscious. Holding the form just takes practice so it varies from person to person. I'd imagine that the longest a walder could hold their form is an entire day if their focus was high enough or they needed to get somewhere fast.

5. Clothing must be left behind or be destroyed in the change. Items as well. Yes, it sucks if it's in the winter and you need your cheetah form to take down a fleeing enemy, but it's a part of the job. The training in the north is done primerly without winter gear, so they have some experiance in the matter. Modesty is usually perserved by having a cache of clothes hidden or turning a hair wrap into a loincloth (those stationed in tropical areas favor this over clothing any day). 

6. Wandler's can leave the order at any time without consequences. However, wandler's who are in service often look down on those who aren't, and life can suck in major cities where wandlers make up a good amount of the population. One character I plan for the first book will be dealing with his father's choice not to join. 

7. The naming conventions are similar to ours. Expect to see some 'Aidens', 'Nathans', 'Devins' and 'Reese's' mixed in with some more fantasy typical names. 

8. No, wandler's can't communicate with animals. If their smart and communicate with the 'animal' inside, they can get a understanding of what the animal is telling them, but outright communication would make them too powerful.    

P.S. This is how I can most acculratly show off how the whole 'animal voice in one's head would work. Sorry if anyone isn't into superheroes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJsMzTG1YCA
   




 Hey Redditors, I had an idea for a world for a possible series I want to write in the future. Here it goes. 

Set in a world similar to the medieval era called Faria, there are people who can become a single animal at will. Called Gestaltwandlers (Wandlers for short), these people are in charge of protecting normal humans and other races from supernatural beings similar to the Fair Folk called Volks. 

Wandlers are found at a young age and taken to one of the three academies and trained in either swordsmanship, archery or magic. They also are taken in by a teacher who becomes their mentor/parent. When they are around 15, they are sent to the Hall of Ice, a  dangerous training center in the frozen north. Once their training is complete, they get sent to one of the major cities and either patrol it or teach new Wandlers. 


When it comes to the world's geography, I need the most input. I know I want it to be similar to Earth's and due to the shapeshifting, I need it to as varied as possible. 

Magic exists, but isn't very reliable. If one is a mage in this universe, they tend to only use magic in rituals, similar to Willow's in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Magic usage opens the caster to the Volks influence and in some cases, can drive them mad. Magic can be used by anyone, regardless of race, species and gender. 

Any questions or possible plot ideas? Leave e'm in the comments below, I would really love the Reddit community could bring! Thanks!  




 Magic and technology can match each other. In my setting, magic was discovered around the first time that spears were made, so it's always been a sort of arms race to see who can outdo the other. However, sometimes machines like airships are a fusion of magic and technology. True robotics is a dangerous and new field and thus golems are a suitable substitute. Healing magic is good for when your on the field and need a quick patch up, but so is a bandage. The major reason why magic and tech are neck and neck is because for every magic spell that's researched, a new piece of tech or weaponry is whipped up in a lab somewhere.  




 Yeah, if it's fantasy, magic is the logical choice. I think sometimes people read into things too much.  




 Pantaria's races
Humans- As varied as normal humans are. Asian, African American, First Nations, you name it, the race is there. 
Elves- Come in two flavors the hipster Light Elves and the kind hearted dark elves
Orcs- Varied as humans. Although they seem brutish, they are actually really intelligent. Not all are warriors and some are mages. 
Fauns- Fauns are bascily humans with goat legs.  




 "Light Elves" in Pantaria are like hipsters. They hangout in expensive areas of towns and cities, selling their custom jewelry and drinking tea and coffee. Light Elves are stereotyped as 'dicks beyond mesure' for their patronizing attitude towards other races, but this sometimes isn't the case. Light elves usually wear their hair long and flowing, braided with silver wire. They wear the most expensive clothes and favor wine brands 'that you've never heard of' like Yentarian Yak or The Crying Dragon. Pioneers in anti gravity magic, their cities are built to float and are often found hovering just above the cloud layer. 

Dark elves are considerd to be really nice in Pantaria. They're similar to Canadians and are polite to everyone, even golems. They don't have a sense of racial tension, and will often try and get races that are at war to party. As a result, many believe that Dark elves are morons due to their ditzy nature, but in actuality dark elves are technical geniuses. Designers of crossbows, war golems, semi automatic mage staves and enhanced swords, Dark Elves cornered the market of weaponry and are the leading minds in weapons. The only two races dark elves have any form of animosity towards are Goblins (due to the weaponry market, Goblin tech is at a disadvantage due to 'accidental explosions')  and Light elves.Dark elves love dwarves due to their mutual love of beer and it's pretty common to see dark elf and dwarf couples getting married.      
  




 The LGBT community in Pantaria isn't a big deal. Sure, gay relationships happen, but one's sexuality doesn't matter when it comes to jobs or marriage. For example, a rouge named Nate is comedically omnisexual, wanting to and implying that he's been in relationships with every gender and species in-universe. He isn't seen as a pervert, just odd due to his mannerisms. Gay teachers are as common as heterosexual ones and aren't discriminated against. Yet the central romance plot is between two humans and is heterosexual. 
I like to portray odd things as normal and accepting the LGBT community is one of the ways that I do it. Plus I can always have a different types of romance to spice things up. 




 Hey Zoey,
I understand how rough things are. My parents and I, all the way across the world in Texas are praying for you! And rember, you're not alone. You have the Yognauts behind you! 




 You need to get an orangutan from the zoo and act like everything's normal. 




 Sir Pratchett would be proud 




 However, it would be awesome if the community did. Considering how devoted some Yogs are and how skilled they are, I'd love to see concept art or something. 




 Hey Yognauts! I've been playing a lot of Leauge of Legends and I wondered, 'what if the Yogscast had a MOBA?' So my question is, if the Yogs made a MOBA, what would their stages, abilities and class types be? 




 We need five different versions of the Yogs from different universes
-Apocalypse World: A post apocalyptic world where all the Yogs are irradiated and use Road Warrior style weapons and skill trees. When in play these Yogs decrease the enemies speed and inflict a 'Fear' debuff that prevents a turn at random

-Super Yogs: A world where a particle accelerator exploded, giving a portion of humans (and dwarves) superpowers. The Yogs are a superhero team. When on the board, all allies gain +5 strength and speed.

-Agents of J.A.F.F.A.: In a world like ours, a covert team created by Canadian, American and British intelligence was formed to protect the internet. These agents wear the same black suit and tie (except for Agent Zoey, her tie is rainbow colored). When in play these Yogs provide a special buff called 'Back up' that increases the strength of allies. 

Dog Yogs: A universe where dogs are the dominate species, the Yogscast consists of dog versions of the normal cast (have fun with the breeds). These cards have a special buff called 'Healing Slobber' that can heal allies or cause minor corrosive damage on foes.

Dragon Rider Yogs: Set in a universe where people ride dragons, a mercenary team called the Yogs, travel to various lands with their dragons and have adventures. These cards are cast two at a time, one card being the dragon rider, the other being their dragon. The Rider card and the dragon card must be on the field at the same time in order to use their unique dragon breath ability. (Sjin's Chili Burn, Rythian's ender flame, Kim's Flux breath ect.)

 




 Plague, I intend on keeping the guild! I was partially inspired by Welcome to Nightvale and The Discworld series to make some of the weirder guilds just for fun. In each story, a new guild will be added and mentioned. In my first book, Death Seekers, there's a guild of Those who stand near street vendors. In the next book, Son of Magik, there's the guild of plague masks. The guilds aren't actually a major factor in stories, but sometimes they'll be hired by the Adventurers Guild to do some unsavory task.  




 In order to be edgy in Pantaria, teenagers tend to wear necromancer robes, even if they don't have any skill with magic. If they aren't into magic, they can start internships for major guilds like the Adventurers Guild, Warlock Guild and the Guild of men wearing those hats that make their faces look like concerned pigs. 

Edginess also depends on species. Elves and gargoyles tend to be conservative, so wearing revealing clothing is obscene, meaning that their teenagers wear little clothing to show defiance. Dark elves don't wear much at all, so teenagers dress in parkas, knit caps, mittens and (perish the thought) scarves. Even Dwarf teenagers show their edginess by hanging out with elves, snorting gemstones and engaging in illegal golem construction.  




 Now I really want Telltale games to make a Tale's from the Disc series. 




 Well how am I going to find a realtor now? 




 Happy birthday Simon! 




 Dear Redditors, today I felt very sad. The man who inspired me to become a writer has passed, but now I feel like I'm going to finish my project because of this. As a tribute to a man who, while not as well known as J.K. Rowling or Tolkien, as touched many more hearts, broke down barriers and inspired this shy young man to become something creator. And as I see Death take Sir Pratchett into the great desert, I thank that man for all that he's done for our world and the Disc. 

It's been a wild, heartwarming, horrifying and hilarious ride through a place that never quite made sense, and still doesn't. But that's the beauty of his stories. They parallel our world so much that I can't help but think that's what he was telling us. The world is crazy and full of the evil,the good, the morally ambiguous and potatoes. 

So, to Sir Pratchett I say good night, not with a heavy heart, but with one that is enriched with the lessons, joy and heart that I have learned from you. Good night Sir , good night. 




 I don't see why someone from inside the department wouldn't do this. He or she would be angry enough at possibly losing their job to an uprising of people they once suppressed for so long. Now is the chance to try and stop them and make them out to be the bad guys, knowing that the news will blow this whole story up and out of proportions.  




 Hey Redditors. Why can people just put on masks and police the streets themselves? Likes a neighborhood watch. 




 Sensory deprevation sphere with speakers hooked up to the inside and a tv. My target can either play sonic 06 or be forced to listen to bad music. 




 Hey Redditors! Just asking for some advice. It's my first year being a volunteer at Quakecon with my two friends, and I'm not sure what position to apply for. My primary skills are in writing and video production. 




 Hey Redditors! For a few months, I've been talking to this girl I met in my college English class. I want to ask her out for pizza, but I'm really nervous. I can't drive, and this is a major source of worry for me. Help! 




 My name is Martyn Littlewood. For five years I was stranded on an Skyblock with only one goal - survive. Now I will fulfill Toby's dying wish - to use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning You-Tube. To do this, I must become someone else. I must become something else. 




 Well, my birthday just got sad. 




 Why not Mac? I understand that PC players will lose their minds when I say this, but I'm a gamer too. 




 If anyone can do it, you can! 




 Damn. Nice. You should do one with the Buffy theme. 
























 It's going to go places! Right now, I have a book in the works, but this universe is next once I'm done. I like the idea of a Nordic looking species though. And I've got you all to thank because without the input, this universe would be scrapped.  




 I want the 'modded' not to be human, but an species that looks like them. The serum thats injected just enhances their physique so they can survive on their homeworld that's incredibly dangerous. The serum doesn't have any deadly side effects, and is only injected once into an new born of the species. It enhances the subject's speed and strength to super soldier levels and accelerates the healing processes of the body. Their hands and feet also become larger and prehensile and grow a layer of thick hair. 

But if injected into a human, the serum can and will kill them unless it's been altered in someway. If given to an exposed, their powers will suddenly overload and become uncontrollable.     




 Yeah, I've seen it. The teenage Evolved could be inspired by superheroes of the past and try to use their abilities to help people or cause destruction. They're powers should be low key, like enhanced intelligence or strength.  




 I like the idea of 'modded' humans or a human-like species. Like if they injected newborns at birth and changed their physiology, similar to the Apex in Starbound. The Evolved I could see becoming major villians with a massive God complex. The exposed could be like metahumans in the new Flash tv show, developing powers, but with downsides.  




 I'm thinking that a race of plant-like aliens would be naturally canivorus, even when raised around other races, they still have a hankering for meat. Another race of humanoids with wings, are naturally airheaded and while they can focus on tasks, they don't really grasp other aspects of human life because they're born to fly. Some species's nature will always shine though.

 




 A species made out of living sound, interesting. I imagine that they might need a special suit to contain themselves or be able to stay cohesive naturally. Or they could forge special collars made of a hyperconductive metal to keep themselves together.   




 Well for starters, the story is about identity. Technology has advanced to the point where 3D printing is like microwaving a pizza and energy weapons are old tech. Space travel is similar to Star Wars, easy to use and accesible to everyone. The story is primarily about finding your identity in the midst of a crisis. The backstory is that the six races fought against a ancient race of robots, The Forbearers. During this 50 year war, civilian lives were torn apart as planets were consumed. The main character is a human named Norm who was raised alongside other orphans from the other races. The aliens are similar in terms of systems of logic, but mortality is different; however, since they were raised in a military orphanage, the human system of morality is prevelant. I just needed help in coming up with ideas for various races. Thanks for the questions though!  




 Hey Redditors, 

I need ya'lls help. I've been thinking about a science fiction story and I've been wondering about races. I know humans will be included, but I need help coming up with about six other races, two of which will become the major antagonists. 
  




 The Chaotic One- A young mage who killed and drew on the power of a ancient god, ascending to near unstoppable power. The only way the newly formed adventurer's guild stopped him was by locking him in a artificially constructed dimension known as The Patchwork World. They then destroyed the portal and destroyed all records of the incident. The only known key to the Patchwork World was placed in rotative custody. 

Mad Jack- A serial killer who appears to have a fake face with a Glasglow grin. It's said that his laughter can kill and that his arms and legs can rotate unnaturally. City Watchmen have seen him multiple times, but can't seem catch him. Has an female accomplice/girlfriend whose name is unknown. Mad Jack's modus operandi seems to be the removal of body parts he doesn't like. The victims all seem to be around the ages of 30-70, men and women, all of which have their genitals, toes and fingers removed, with Orcs having tusks violently ripped out of their jaws. He is still at large. 

Cleric D'Trac- A former cleric in a small town, this mass murderer teleported his entire chapel along with every resident in the town, into a mysterious dimension. Over the course of several weeks, corpses of the towns folk began appearing in major cities, covered in scars of varying size and a foul smelling purple liquid. Some of the bodies seemed to be partially eaten. D'Trac was found in the city of Cactus Bluffs in the early morning hours, with missing right eye. His left ear had been replaced with a partially sutured on Elven ear and his arms and left half of his face was covered in a purple sludge. He was rambling on about the end of all days and how 'we are awash in a bath of sin'. When questioned, D'Trac revealed that he had tried to purify his followers but some 'Didn't listen.' Deemed insane, he has been sent to a maximum security asylum for magic users.       




 A race generator 




 Congrats! 




 All of dwarves, both male and female, have facial hair to some degree and possess the ability to transform into stone at will. That aside, they're actually very intelligent and their cities are major centers of commerce, and their mine-shafts are a shining example of their architectural skills.

Their culture will be touched upon in the current book I'm working on, but in a nutshell it falls into two categories. 1.Are you a warrior? and 2. If your a mage, get the hell out of our city. Dwarves dislike mages because their abilities are destructive and dangerous, especially when used in mining. Dwarves are also very conservative people, preferring to stick with what they know than go outside the box. As a culture they enjoy beer and have a yearly festival for the beverage. They worship Tal'ton the god of the Forge and Tal'an, his wife the goddess of the mines. They also seem to love adopting human children.     




 It's really fun and well written. Do you think my take on dwarves was a little stereotypical? 




 Cool. I'm taking a more 'Prattchet-eque' approach, wherein I have a new group of characters for each story and have a big crossover to tie them together.  




 So what's the main plotline of the story? 




 The Skyweavers are dragons, right? 




 That's interesting, because every nation has a standing army, but they aren't really racially exclusive. And I haven't really thought about a pantheon, I guess I should do that! 




 Hey Redditors,
Today is a sad day today. I entered my remedial college Math class today and sat down to work on a review. As I read over the problems, I realized to my horror and embarrassment that I couldn't remember what I worked so hard to remember for the entire week. Now, I need you all's help because I've come to the conclusion that these Math courses aren't going to work with my disability. Are there any alternatives or ideas to get around these classes? And how do you guys deal with the anger, frustration and depressiveness that comes with this? 




 Well, at first I wanted to defy that expectation of 'Dark Elves are always surly and psychopathic.' Then i realized that they could be somewhat like the Canadians of Pantaria; friendly and pleasant to everyone, so I stuck with that. 

In-universe the Dark Elves are nice because they're neutral when it comes to warfare. Even though they build a lot of weapons and advanced magical items, they don't use them unless they're adventurers. Over the years, this has made them overall a calm and kind race that has the highest interspecies adoption rate of any other.     









 Dwarves- Depends on their relation to you. Family members tend to be hugged, but only if their human. Dwarven family members great each other by punches to the gut and face. Dwarves great teammates like anyone else, a friendly word and handshake does it just fine. Dwarven culture is centered around strength. The stronger you are, the more valued you are in the family. Mages are looked down upon due to they're less than stellar physical strength.
 

Orcs- Orcs snort at each other. The louder the snort, the more fond they are of you. A short snort means they don't like you. Orcs are a race based around teamwork and food. Most Orcs are great a cooking and value chefs of any caliber. As a result, it's not uncommon to hear snorts coming from Orc kitchens or restaurants.   

Dark Elves- Dark Elves are the friendlist of races and they greet other races with a wave of their hand and the offering of a drink. No matter where you are, NEVER turn down a dark elf's offering of a drink. Dark Elves are all about sharing knowledge, so if you absolutely can't drink, tell them a story.  

Light Elves- High elves insult you due to they're elitist society. If they really like you, the worse the insult. It's not uncommon for a light elf to be found in a pub, swearing at his or her companions. 

Zarians- Zarians will assume your form or voice as a sign that they like you. It's not really a sign of respect, more of a assurance that they acknowledge you enough to say, 'I like you, so I'll become you.' Needless to say, most people find this really creepy. 

Clawtians- They purr. Thats it, they're cat people, what more do you want?

Gnomes- Gnomes will clink their tools together, symbolizing their societal belief of equality among all trades. When with other races, they do this to bond.    
 




 Well, just think about real life, and apply the fantastic. For example, I've created a Community College for wizards. The humor comes from the fact that it's a normal institution but given a fantasy twist.   




 I've started to work on a few adventuring interns as the protagonists, I'd like to see what you guys would think about them.

Carter, a mage who is terrible with magic. While he can use basic fire and polymorph spells, he can't do much else and is usless in a phsyical fight. 

Nate is a borderline sociopathic kleptomaniac rouge. It is heavily implied that his childhood was not normal, and through out the book, his nonchalant reactions towards death, assassins and arson reveal that he was raised by an assassin. Nate is also hypersexual, not having any qualms against sleeping with anyone or anything. In combat he uses a crossbow and throwing knives that he isn't very good at throwing. He sucks at hand to hand and relies on trickery and dirty tactics to win. 

Daniel- I know he's a young swordsman, but I need ya'lls help for him in terms of personailty and quirks

Kara is a young woman who is raised by dwarves. As a result, she is capable of defending herself in hand to hand combat and is the only party member who is able to hold off multiple opponents single handily. However, while she is a badass, Kara isn't very good in social situations and due to the dwarven tradition of judo throwing people as a way of saying 'hello', this leads to some really awkward situations.

   




 I would suggest playing Dungeons of Dredmore or read the Discworld series. Both are examples of humor in a fantasy story.  




 "Hey cutie, you awake?" a high pitched male voice asked me. I felt a hand on my shoulder and my eyes fluttered open. I was in what appeared to be a sort of temple, like the Parthenon. Then I screamed when I saw who shook me awake. A guy around my age, with matching features; black crew cut hair, brown skin and green eyes; but wearing what appeared to be a ratty blonde wig, mini-skirt and ill fitting pink t-shirt. His all too familiar eye brows crinkled in confusion.

"Um, you okay hot stuff?" he asked, stepping back. Another guy who looked exactly like him but wearing a stained lab-coat and googles came up behind him and peered at me. 
"Christopher of Earth 2607, are you alright?" he asked in a posh British accent. He waved what appeared to be a metal rod with a yellow crystal at the end over me and smiled broadly. 
"Oh great, your body and psyche survived the transdimensional transference." he announced. 
"Wait, what on Earth is going on?!" I shouted. Then it hit me. 
"Y-you're all me!" I shouted, pointing to the scientist and the man in the miniskirt. They both nodded. 
"Well, more like alternative versions of you. Each on of us is like you in someway, but we're also different." said scientist me. "For example, Marshmallow here is a version of you who is a crossdresser." he said, gesturing to the man in the skirt. "I on the other hand, grew up in London and graduated Oxford with my doctorate in Theoretical Physics." 

"At twenty?" I asked skeptically. Oxford shrugged. "Yes, but on my version of Earth, everyone is a genius, so that's like graduating from preschool." He turned and clapped his hands. A group of around ten different versions of me came out from behind the columns. One version of me was wearing what appeared to be futuristic Roman legionnaire armor and carrying a energy sword. Another was wearing a dark blue hood and body armor, with a bow slung over his back. A few versions weren't even human. One was a lizard-man, wearing jeans and a t-shirt that said 'Go sun yourself'. A raccoon with black fur and green eyes scampered up to me and sniffed at my jeans leg. 

"Aw, hey little fella!" I crooned and extended a hand to scratch his ear but his paw batted my hand away. 
"No touching the merchandise pal!" he growled in a New York accent. I looked back at Oxford in shock. 

"I'm a raccoon in another universe?!" Oxford nodded. 
"Yes, I should've told you that sometimes evolution ensures that humans aren't always the dominate species. Resident of former Earth 56 is a-" 

"Wait, you said former Earth. Why?" I asked, a bad feeling growing in my stomach. Oxford frowned and began rubbing the back of his neck, the same way that I did when I get nervous. 

"Yes, well that's the problem. Our home Earths are being destroyed. I've been able to pull a few of us from other universes to here." He gestured to the building. "A pocket universe. We'd be safe here, but that's not the point. Right now, the entire multiverse is in danger. If too many alternate Earths are destroyed, the multiverse will lose stability." 

"And if that happens everything falls apart?" I finished. Oxford nodded. "Yes, I'm afraid that's what will happen unless we do something fast. We'll need to go to each of our home Earths and begin investigating. If we can find the source of what is causing this 'incursion' we should be able to stop it." I frowned. "Why do you need me?" I asked. "I'm just a colledge student." Oxford smiled. 
"We need you because your the bravest one out of all of us." He handed me a silver bracelet with a red gemstone. "That is a teleport back to here. If anything goes wrong, press that gem and you'll be warped right back." Roman me steped forward and placed his hand on my shoulder. 

"I will take you to my Earth, doppleganger." he said in a voice that was much deeper than mine. I nodded, feeling slightly intimidated. This version of me was six feet tall and build like a linebacker. A glowing 'rip'  appeared in the air before me. I could see a hazy image of some sort of training room, or was it a locker room, it was hard to tell. Oxford cleared his throat. 

"When you are on another world, do not mention anything about your own world. Doing so will have devastating consequences." He said. I nodded and Roman me placed and hand on my shoulder. 
"Come. We have work to attend to." he said, before we both entered the breach.

 If you want to be an adventurer, you need to be able to fight, either with magic or weapons. Even then, you need to be a subordinate under a more experienced adventurer, basically an intern. You get paid crap, you get thrown into deadly situations and you most likely will wind up with some broken bones or a magical ailment. You still there and not running off in terror? Wow, you must be pretty brave Intern ZakTH. So basically adventures are dolled out in order of importance. Is there a massive creature rising up out of the ocean, attacking the coast? Higher priority than a goblin raid on a small town.The Guild's are typically sponsored by cities in order to have the adventuer's help to defend them if needed. Street crime is off limits though and the City Watch (police officers) will deal with that.  

Freelancers will usually take care of low level adventures, like finding lost trinkets or clearing out bandits. They don't get paid much, but people tend to like them more than the big name adventures because they're willing to help.       




 Well, for starters, Pantaria's magic is like physics. It's a core part of the world. Mages, are people born with the ability to tap into and wield magic. Wizards are born with the ability to control magic, but they can't tap into like mages, so they use objects that are enchanted (charged) with magic to perform feats. Witches are exclusivly women and some gay men who must use potions and ingredients to cast spells. Warlocks are magic users who have an affinity for magic that is taboo, such as being a living voodoo doll, mind flaying or summoning demons at will. Their powers are also bound to them and it's hard for a Warlock to use other types of magic. All magic users must be witty to a degree.

Magic has rules in-universe, as it is a physical law. Some forms of magic like typical firebolts, icebolts and polymorphism are soft scale magic. However, hard magic comes in when things like summoning eldritch beings from other planes are involved.  

Adventuring isn't that profitable unless your with The Guild of Adventures, a team of adventurer's who get a reasonable salary based on the fact that they take on big name cases. They're so big that they can afford a headquarters building in the nicer district in FoxCliff; a major city. A freelance adventurer might make enough for a apartment if they undertook around ten missions a day. What really draws young adventurer's in is the prospect of finding a massive amounts of treasure and fame. The entire industry is meant to be similar to being a You-tuber, but with more of a risk of death.  




 Yo Redditors!
I'm working on a new book and figured you guys could help me out by fleshing out the world. Basically, it's set in a middle ages themed  world where magic is like science and adventuring is an industry. The primary characters are adventuring interns. I need to make this quick, but AMA!  




 Pantaria has tons of magic types, like divisions of science. I have golem crafting, advanced golem crafting, dimension travel, deity magic, standard elemental magic, necromancy, summoning magic, hedge wizardry, Booze wizardry (yeah, it's just what you think. Great at parties), bibilomancy, time travel, dark arts, grey arts, white arts, warlock and witch magic, zoological magic, physics magic and potion brewing/enchanted object creation. 
Magic is a primary force in the world, so it's grown over time, much like science. It started with basic elemental manipulation, but some people are born with an affinity towards on type of magic.   
























 Hey Redditors,

I've been working on a book for the better part of a year now, and i wanted to show off the main characters and get some feedback regarding them. The basic plot is that death has stopped working and the five protagonists have to find out why before the world ends.

I've started to work on a few adventuring interns as the protagonists, I'd like to see what you guys would think about them.

Carter, a mage who is terrible with magic. While he can use basic fire and polymorph spells, he can't do much else and is useless in a physical fight.

Nate is a borderline sociopathic kleptomaniac rouge. It is heavily implied that his childhood was not normal, and through out the book, his nonchalant reactions towards death, assassins and arson reveal that he was raised by an assassin. Nate is also hypersexual, not having any qualms against sleeping with anyone or anything. In combat he uses a crossbow and throwing knives that he isn't very good at throwing.

Felix is the grim reaper's teenaged and amnesiac apprentice. He is the voice of reason in the cast and tries his best to guide the them in the right direction. As the apprentice of Death, he is capable of teleporting and entering the realm of the dead. Despite the fact that he wears a skull mask, he's a nice guy. 




 Hey Redditors,

I think I might be a low level empath. Whenever there's an argument around the house or I talk to someone with high levels of emotion, I pick up on how they're feeling and 'acquire' it to my own mental state. For example, if my mom is angry, I become unhappy. I've tried shutting this off, but I can't seem to. Some times this can be great, like when I'm talking to girls, I can pick up on 'vibes' and say the right things, but other times, when in an argument, this is bad. Any suggestions on what to do?  




 Yeah, as a little feedback, I don't care about credentials! I'm not an employer, I'm a reader. I need to know if this character likes chocolate ice cream, or if his wife died and started his path to being a hero or even if he's secretly gay! Tell US about THEM personally. You need to know these characters inside and out. 




 Hey Redditors,

Just wondering, is there a separate subreddit for character feedback, or can I do it here? I don't want to seem to egotistical.

Thanks, much love!  




 Hey Redditors,

I want to make a Minecraft Machinima, but I don't know how. I work on a Mac, and I only have one computer.

Thanks
 




 I could see Turps or Strippin as golems, Fiona as a shape shifter and Strife as a Griffin. 




 On second thought, I'll just make the world with multiple biomes, but a very large jungle region along the Equator 




 It's the same size as earth. 




 Oh wow. I'm not much for climatology, but thanks man, I'll add some more biomes then. 




 Nice work! I personally would've chosen wolves or otters, but I made the post, so I figured it would be in bad taste.  




 Interesting! Very Tarzanish! 














 The idea is that having archenemy is easy in a world where superhumans exist. Forming rouges galleries would be made simple through the app. Also, I wanted that whole ,'borderline in a committed relationship' that some superheroes like Batman have with some of their enemies. And The Quake and Screech will eventually develop that overtime. 




 It wasn't that I was a bad superhero. I'd fought criminals, like Big Figure, Crag and Crowbar. But I didn't have a arch nemesis like my friends. I knew that getting an arch would propel me into superhero stardom, but I just couldn't get a break. So I turned to the internet, a phone application called Find-a-Nemesis. I met a guy around my age, 19, named Mathis. After we got to know each other, we agreed to go meet in person. 

I stood at the door of the apartment as it was wrenched open by a heavy set teenager wearing a pink t-shirt with a cartoon pony on the front. His face was covered in acne and his glasses were perched on his greasy nose, over a cheap black mask that hardly stretched over his face. A red cape was tied around his neck and he wore a pair of matching gloves that went up to his elbows. 

"Hey are you Mathis?" I asked, hoping that this was his fanboy brother. Not that I was picky, but I didn't think this guy could even walk a mile, let alone withstand one of my sonic screams. He scowled at me.
"I am Mathis." he annouced with a heavy lisp. "And I assume you are Wyatt, AKA, The Screech." My heart fell. This guy is my arch? Damn it. "I was expecting someone at little more- you know- capable of putting up an impressive fight." I said sheepishly. Mathis grinned, showing me a row of yellow stained teeth. He flexed his flabby arms and glared at me. After a minute of awkward silence, the ground began to shake. 
"Um, is that it?" I asked. Mathis nodded. 
"You have felt the power of... THE QUAKE!" I groaned.
"No." I said. "I can find someone better for the job, thanks though." I turned and began walking down the street. I opened the Nemesis app and turned on the locator. 'No new nemesis's in your area' it read. Damn. I turned back to Mathis.  
"Ok, fine. I guess your my arch. Let's make this quick." 




 No, Patrons can tell who is a another patron and who isn't. Plus a lot of their meat comes from the dinosaur-like creatures. 




 I'm thinking that the type of magic is going to be exclusive to your patron animal with the exception of deity boons. For example, a lion shapeshifter would have a ability to enhance their strength for a amount of time, but the a lioness priestess could call for a certain god's help in battle for whatever.     




 There are other varying climates, but a large part of the world is jungle and rainforest. 




 Nope. No one is 'normal'. Unless i decide to make a story where that is the case. 




 They prey on the week. Interesting.  




 This will be a book series. I just need ideas for how each race, (black, white, asian) could be represented. The overall goal for the world is to make it as cool as possible while being as relatively realistic as I can be with magic and shapeshifters. And there is a sort of 'Republic' like the Roman Empire that's important.     




 Hey Redditors, 
I had an idea for a world where every biome is a jungle, baring the poles. The people have the ability to become their patron animal, like a jaguar, parrot, river dolphin ect. Dinosaur-like creatures also exist. I need your help because I'm not sure where to take this concept .  




 Pantaria used to have a Magocractic council. Unfortunately, after two hundred years of the chaotic and an ultimately unproductive rule, it was dissolved but has been reformed twenty years before the events of the series. The magocracy was and still is corrupt, run by a lazy and idiotic council of wizards and a few sensible witches. People generally don't care about the council, as everyone knows that only a major event would get them to agree on anything. The only thing stopping the mages from doing whatever they want is food. All council members have four feasts a day, and are so fat, they need levitation chairs to get around. They don't care about anything but their own political agenda, and will fiercely defend it, often times to the death. The council members will usually be either top graduates of prestigious magic academies, be the sons or daughters of former council members, or just kill their way into a council seat.  




 I slammed the door to my apartment and bolted the door just in time to hear the frantic whirring of the now sentient vacuum robot outside my door. I opened my blinds and looked down into the L.A streets, as the sea of black and silver machines swarmed over the screaming crowd. A woman standing on a taxi screamed as two of the sucking bastards tackled her and began viciously sucking at her face and hands. There was a loud squelching noise and a crimson spray of gore splattered across the hood of the taxi, as her now faceless corpse slid down into the machines below. 

"Oh god, help! Someone help!" A man wearing a pink cardigan shouted, his high voice becoming hard to hear of the roar of the cacophonous machines. The man had managed to climb on to the bus that was parked below my apartment window. I wrenched open the window and threw down the emergency rope ladder, thanking my overcautious mother for the gift. 

"Grab on!" I shouted down to the man. He looked up, relief passing over his blood splattered face. He grabbed the second rung and began climbing. For a second, I though he'd make it, but then it all went to hell. A few Roombas had managed to somehow climb on to the roof of the bus and where beginning to devour the lower rungs. The man was halfway up before my door was broken down by at least thirty of the robotic bastards, each one sucking up splinters of the door. I shrieked and held on to the ladder with one hand, while struggling to fend off the ravenous vacuums with a broom. Then my hand slipped and the ladder fell. I managed to look over the edge of my windowsill to see the man fall, screaming on to the bus with a nasty crack. His leg was hanging at an odd angle, blood dripping from a compound fracture into the sea of vacuums below. Then they all turned their attention away from civilians and began to swarm the bus, pushing, shoving like a school of piranhas. The Roombas in my apartment were distracted, so I pushed them out of the way and ran down the hallway. I didn't know where to go next, but I heard about a quarantine zone a few miles outside the city. I just hoped I could make it.             
 




 Happy birthda-vorp 




 Oh totally. I need a sidekick though 




 My name is Chris. And I am a wizard. When I was a child I saw my mother killed by something impossible. My father went to prison for her murder. Then an accident made me the impossible. To the outside world I am an ordinary dishwasher, but secretly I use my yeti powers to fight crime and find others like me. And one day, I'll find who killed my mother and get justice for my father. I am frostyetiwizard. 




 Oh, god, I can see each of us with a Arrow style opening 




 A cross dressing superheroine vs a guy who wears yeti slippers and a wizard robe with a sonic howl? 




 Thanks! A lot of fun! I really wish we could find an artist to make a group poster, just to see how silly everyone would look! 




 During the day, he's an ordinary 20 year college student and part time dishwasher. But by night, he throws off his Smite t-shirt and becomes..... frostyetiwizard! Diving into a pair of sturdy jeans, wizard robe, Kick-Ass style mask and yeti slippers, frostyetiwizard patrols the streets of Seattle, battling foul villains from his Rogues Gallery such as Downstrike, Southafricanon and his arch enemy, firegoblinwarlock. Our heroes powers are frost beams, a magical cape that lets him fly and a sonic Yeti howl that can shatter glass.  




 Oh, I see! Well, considering how they're human-like, their home planet is about the same distance from their sun as Earth is from ours. 




 I don't quite understand.
