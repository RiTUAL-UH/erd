 No. 




 This is precisely the type of intellect that successfully crashed the gun legislation in the Senate. Keep up the brilliant rhetoric. 




 So every gun is misused, but the internet is only occasionally misused by pedophiles? Yeah... 




 I'm only asking  - if you want the government monitoring every weapon, why not allow for them to monitor every email? 





























 So you don't trust the government to monitor your internet activity, but you trust them to be the only ones with big guns? Brilliant. 




 why would buying a gun mean a school shooting? More people use the internet to harm children than use guns to harm children. 




 I'm questioning the validity of regulating either. Loughner had a legally purchased handgun when he went after Giffords but she is advocating banning AR15's? To me it's the equivalent of one saying "I'm the victim of a hate crime, it's time we ban CO2 emissions". 




 'The people that around me' care deeply about your personal sympathies. 




 Every knife is designed to kill as well. But most don't. It depends whos hands you place it in. The same for guns, the Internet, vehicles, fertilizer etc. Anything can be misused in the wrong hands. But we should just monitor everything all the time to be safe and to protect the children. 
























 No one should be OK with this. 









 Let's beat our chests and grunt while womenfolk bring us meat. Primate. 









 A knife is designed to kill just as a gun is. If you put a knife in your grandmothers hand, sliced bread. Put it in Ted Bundys, sliced teenager. Some could argue a gun is designed for target practice. It depends again on who is holding it. 





























 Appropriate spanking is needed in this country. There is absolutely nothing wrong with slapping your child across the mouth when he or she back talks, how else will they learn not to??? 














 Because now is the time we prove to the world that our system works, not bend it, twist it, manipulate it and prove precisely why it doesn't. There is a larger picture here. The general publics media-fueled primitive thirst for instant vengeance is not beneficial to this country. 
























 Hashtag alcoholism 




 I don't think you know the meaning of what you just said. There are contradictions in your sentence that nearly created a tear in the fabric of space-time.  









 If an Hispanic man being found innocent via a completely legal jury is openly called racism by our president, what is the blatant ignoring of an entire city that is predominantly black called? No one seems to care that Detroit specifically and Michigan generally is falling into the ground. If this were Santa Barbara or Arlington, you would see overnight Congressional bipartisan councils moving mountains to assist.
