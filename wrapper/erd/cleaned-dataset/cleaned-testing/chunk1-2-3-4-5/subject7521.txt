 Less creepy, more like lucky. A free breast inspection with no strings attached. Good for you man 




 Sounds awesome, I'll have to get a hold of some haha. Thanks for the quick info! 




 I'm curious. I'm a fairly experienced toker, but I am unaware of what shatter is; while it sounds intense as hell. 




 That is the most unfortunate thing that I have ever heard happen to an innocent person on the toilet. My prayers go out to you, OP. 




 Your story wasn't so much creepy, as it was long-winded. However, it didn't seem like she was to kind anyways the way she tried to embarrass you in that restaurant. Oh well dude, at least you tried. 
























 Am I the only one who actually enjoys sleep paralysis, and purposefully induces it; occasionally trying to push it as far as I can, hoping some fucking insane hallucination happens.... Or is it just me? 




 It says further in the wiki that you can be infected with the virus by simply handling a wild snail of this species. 




 Read that at like a [6]. Now I'm rethinking life (-) 




 It's because when your telling the truth, you get tired of repeating yourself over and over. When your lying, you are more concerned with keeping your lie together that you don't get as irritated. This is what I've seen at least. 




 But she ain't messin with no broke niqqas... 
























 Twins! Basil. 




 Barcelona. It is, by far, my favorite band. My friend only showed me them earlier this year, but I have listened to their music all the time. Just recently, I saw them live at a local venue. I can't describe it as anything other than amazing. 




 I really want to know if anyone got chosen for such a honor. 




 The answer is always pot. 




 That is exactly how I came to enjoy sleep paralysis. I have yet to fully project though sadly ;-; 





























 I'm currently struggling with a similar situation, and I can tell how she feels about me; but I am uncertain as to how I feel about her. It's a horrible feeling to think that you may be leading someone, who actually cares for you, on a fruitless journey, and how you may have to end the relationship sooner so they don't get hurt as much. 




 Lol I learned that with my very first girlfriend.  




 That Ace Ventura gif made me lose it XD 




 That was quite the topic change... 
























 I can only partly understand your feelings OP. I'm 18, and my very first girlfriend, I had started dating at the beginning of December. She came off as quiet, but when she got used to you she would talk your ears off. She also warned me. Of how her past would be extremely difficult to work through. Like you, I thought I could handle it. But I was naive. I didn't go through the things you did (the late nights with her extremely depressed), but I did fully realize what 7 years of self-harm can do to a person. And how utterly and hopelessly depressed some people can be. I couldn't bring my self to love her the way she needed. It was far too taxing for my very first relationship, and it honestly scared the hell out of me. The self-harm made me push her away. I also tried to end it as soon as I realized, because I didn't want her feelings for me to deepen to the point where she feels the need to end it all. I was torn up in the break-up, and what made it worse is that I'm positive that instead of helping her condition, I only added more scars to her body and heart. It's a rough life. Good Luck to you man.

 One Day Too Late by Skillet

It helps me when I lose sight of my goals, or when I have an opportunity to take a risk for a benefit. 




 That was pretty funny. I read the narrator like it would sound in the Stanley Parable game. Good story. 




 I was thinking this was your way of saying that OP got gold, but now I'm rethinking that thought.
