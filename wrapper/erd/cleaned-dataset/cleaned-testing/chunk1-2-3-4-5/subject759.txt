 Boobs. 




 Is that just, like.. A big bowl of meat?? 




 At first I wasn't sure about this compilation but by the end of course I had tears in my eyes. A unique version of a "Most Heartwarming/Heartbreaking Photos" collection, I thought it was pretty touching. 




 Mind over matter; what a crazy wild thing! 




 I LOVED this book when I was little and currently still love it. I found it again at a yard sale last year and all my positive childhood memories came rushing back!  




 Seconded: go see a doctor and they'll give you the answers to these questions but seriously dude this is not an area to take any medical chances with in my opinion.

Likely it's a rash from some kinda soap or clothing or whatever, but you're best bet is to have the doctor tell you that and get it cleared up before it gets worse.  




 Lemons; some full and some cut in half. The full ones can be thrown at people and the cut in half ones can be squeezed into peoples eyes mwahahaha! You walk in with your lemons, attack anyone who gets in your way, blind everyone with lemon juice, and walk out with the diamonds!

Edit: oops got caught up in the fantasy and forgot it was a has station. So instead you walk out with the CASH and CANDY!! 




 This is the perfect type of question to ask the people over at r/outoftheloop :)

you should try posting there if you are confused about something and looking to to get an explanation.  




 We can't stop here; this is bat country! 
























 its ok that you really liked her and now you miss her even if she wasnt in your life that long. i get it; it happens. thats just something you are going to have to give yourself time to get over and move on. 

On the other hand it sounds like the girl has some issues of her own that she is dealing with; trust, commitment, not knowing who she is or what she wants (all hypothetical of course but she was obviously flipflopping at the very least based on this tiny impression you gave on her) so this might just be for the best. 

keep in mind; you didnt end anything on bad terms, take your time and go easy on yourself and try to find some fun distractions in the meantime is my advice. you said you have gone on other dates, so you will clearly have new options, keep an open mind and you never know what will happen.

you should maybe post this over at r/advice or r/relationships because i feel they would be more inclined to give in-depth advice at those types of subs. 




 so but who gets that donut? 




 the home depot logo makes it particularly classy ;) 




 its gross but ive probably gone like 1-2 weeks when im in a bout of depression; they get all stained up (mostly by coffee and cigarettes) and they feel grimy in my mouth. Also plaque builds up, which is the only thing that isnt fixed once i start brushing again (thank god for whitening toothpaste). 

when i start back with the brushing and flossing i also notice all the space and holes between my teeth which i couldnt feel at all during the non-brushing weeks, and notice the food stuck in between them immediate. so the less you floss your teeth, the less it feels like you even have to floss, cuz your teeth are all clogged up with grime.

i feel like i talked for way too long about this gross personal subject. im going to hit save before i change my mind completely.

edit: spellings 




 my highschool had "math for everyday life" which was supposed to be the remedial math class, but was probably the most useful class for highschool students since it taught you how to understand and calculate mortgages, bank ( /other) loans and interest rates, how do understand and do your income ( /other) taxes; stuff that people actually need to know to be an adult. I thought that was pretty good, too bad it was only supposed to be for the "dumb" kids cuz im pretty sure everyone would benefit from that type of class... 




 highschool sweetheart: we were both too immature to particpate in a real relationship. we are friends now and have talked about how different it would have been if we were both mature adults. our relationship was technically "off and on" because we broke up over every (stupid) fight but became "official" again shortly thereafter, rinse and repeat for 2-3 years. lots of jealousy and dumb arguments, that type of shit.

edit: accidental words 




 leave it; its his closet now. 




 WHOA WHOA WHOA that was some cold shit outta nowhere..!

..Wait maybe the ex learned to read and write? 




 0_o 
























 cobra's gunna cobra: cant argue with that..

another gem: we SHOULD make fun of drunk drivers. 




 the question is: what was it used for??

but really i think its fair to use a washcloth with soap to wash your body, i'm sure i know people who do that. I remember thats how we showered when we were kids, but i personally havent used a washcloth in years. straight up soap to skin all the way! 




 Lawlz. Of course. 




 YOU are a fat ...mmBITCH! 




 thats fair 




 shes gunna look super hot lying prone on the couch when her back is out tomorrow, amirite guys??  




 ...is it? i feel like things like winters are cold enough to freeze things... 

although actually i guess the cold beverage may only count as "nice" if you are drinking it while you are very hot, which maybe requires electricity, so since then, sure i could see that. 




 maybe im trying to overthink this but... i dont get it? whos taking off the top? man or woman? does it matter? im definitely overthinking this; help a brother out people! 




 right? 

here's an idea; lets give drunk people tiny razor sharp objects and encourage them to throw them around the bar. 
great work, everyone!

its actually shocking and/or impressive  how rarely you hear about horrible dartgame blindings or maimings.. 

edit: words 
























 now, im not a bartender but isnt that, like.. its job?

still, definitely a r/perfectfit :) 




 mmmm tree blood... plus like, fruit is flower fetuses, no? or no wait, flower genitals? SOMEthing delicious. 




 no no you're missing the point; if we make fun of the drunk drivers maybe they WONT die in drunk driving accidents; it will help them change their ways! that or the younger generation will grow up really believing in how stupid it is, because they will get made fun of it they ever did it. we're not making fun of the families who have already suffered; we're not monsters! 




 okay yep thats a good call; but in that case i prefer the scrubby things instead of a washcloth, or an exfoliating face/body wash. i feel like a washcloth doesnt scrub hard enough somehow; so apparently for me its either no scrub just soap; or super scrub shiny face styles... i never thought about this before but its strange and true. 




 no, i wash my ass with face soap.

nah but really, the soap is clean; thats why its soap. as long as you rinse after using so theres no hairs or whatever. 




 this is a tough one: my heart says GO FOR IT but my head says make sure you know what you are doing before you go messing  around in that little kids life; he should be her and your priority when it comes to any kind of life decisions. dont go in and out of his life needlessly, it sounds like he has it rough enough as it is.

other than that it sounds like you could be good for her and it would be worth having this kind of conversation with her if she feels the same way. 




 i think this doesnt always work: i dont know if its because they dont update at the same rate but im pretty sure links ive already voted on my computer still appear on mobile unvoted. conversely, however, i think sometimes voted app links appear purple on the site. i might be wrong though, i wasnt paying attention until now.. 




 pretty sure comment karma is straight garbage; link karma or GTFO  




 (-_-) 
























 ohhhhhhhhhh SNAP 




 dude hates the band.. or maybe his entire life. 




 im confused, no vaping allowed, so people smoked instead? 

Seems... conspicuous. 




 The SuckCut: it SUCKS as it CUTS 




 talk about your first world problems... 




 this seems more creepy than funny... 




 bummer, dude. 




 okay wait, lets talk about this because i dont understand it either. what exactly do all the children mean, can someone explain? im super out of the loop on this one.. 




 okay sure, but drag a mop around once it awhile too, k?

edit: now im just imagining the bathroom at the beginning of Trainspotting and thinking there arent enough flushes in the world...
