 You gotta play ["Los Cuates de Sinaloa"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUmpTKXpIdM) all the time in your car now.  ;) 




 Leaked images? Why haven't I seen these? 




 Not really, what I want and what Republicans want aren't always synonymous.

Examples:

1. Legalize friggin' marijuana already.
2. Let anyone get married at any institution that will perform the ceremony.
3. Pull all troops from any foreign country; let them protect OUR boarders, not other countries' boarders.
4. No more foreign aid until we no longer have national debt.
5. Disband the IRS, and enforce a flat tax.  It's fair.  Poor people buy cheaper things; rich people buy more expensive things.  It's fair; quit whining.
6. etc...

 To paraphrase Ronald Regan:

I didnt leave the Republican party, the Republican Party left me.

Don't get me wrong, I can't STAND Democrats, but I've slowly started hating Republicans more and more since I turned 18 back in 1999.  They're all talk, and no action.  The "Republican" candidates that do get into office are so middle-of-the-road, that nothing happens.

I think I will now consider myself a Conservative Libertarian.  Screw the (D)/(R) parties.  I'm sick of this crap. 



















 Ah.... j'aime l'inceste. 




 Well, terrorist don't seem to care what the Christians are doing; just that they're Christians... so the "Reverse-terrorism" label still stands. 




 "Reverse-terrorism"? 




 Really?  My trumpet doesn't play a note simply because I push a valve down. 




 Sampler is a button representing a set sound.

Beatboxing is live sound using an instrument (vocal and percussion). 




 Hell yes!

Kanye = listed as being able to play "keyboards", "sampler" (not even an instrument), "percussion", and "sythesizer".

Beck = listed as being able to play "guitar", "keyboards", "bass", "drums", "harmonica", "percussion", "sitar", "banjo", "slide guitar", "12-string guitar", "glockenspiel", "vocorder", "kalimba", "melodica", and "beatboxing".

I'd say Beck is a better musician. 




 Covered?  No.

A few large, dark hairs?  Yes.  Enough that it's unsettling. 




 Yeah, even MORE surfaces to get saturated in urine! 




 Every time I see this, all I see is the duck that the Americas turns into. 




 Do you ladies sometimes milk being pregnant to make people do things for you? I swear that my wife did that during each pregnancy. 




 Because most dudes don't like sucking on a hairy nipple. 




 Lady Margery of Pimbleton.  




 Herp-derp...  




 It's satirical humor.  Get a sense of humor, why don't ya? 









 Oh, my God--That needs to happen! 




 Amen to that! 




 Interesting infographic! Thanks! 




 I can't stand the dude either. 




 He's done so many of them, though. 




 Amen! 




 Bodyguards protect people from other people, not from themselves. 




 The only downside to metric time would be that a year wouldn't match the rotation of the Earth. 




 Yep.  That's exactly my point! 









 She was a little to flat for me, but she had nice nips. 




 The same nail bed, just has a gap where the nail bed might be dead.

Does it grow back at the same rate as the larger part? 




 Unfortunately, what this idiot doesn't realize is that this was an AMA... not a Kanye Music Award.

If this fuck-nut wants to judge music, let him host and pay for his own show.  What a jackass. 




 Ingrown toenail, man. 




 What the heck ***is*** that? 




 Loved the shower scene back when I was 16-17.  HAHA! 




 Married for 5 years now with three kids.  We're great! 




 And you've never even HEARD of Beck?  I could understand not being able to name a song by someone, but not even knowing who they are...?

I couldn't name a Kanye West song, but I know who he is. 




 Haha!  Weird!  I watched that last night on Netflix for nostalgia's sake. 



















 Me: "Can you PLEASE stop being so lazy around the house? I work overtime hours to come home to a messy house and you watching television!  If I didn't do the dishes, cleaned up the house, do laundry, etc., then NO ONE would. It's getting really damn old, and you're setting a bad example for the three kids!" 









 "...who acknowledge Jesus with their lips, walk out the door, and deny Him by their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable."  ~Brennan Manning
_________________________

I first heard this quote in the intro to DC Talk's "What If I Stumble?" back in 1995 when I was 14 years old.  I got it then, but it means so much more to me now that I'm coming up on 34.

I strive to be a good example for others, but more specifically for my children.  I try to keep this quote in mind.  Thought I'd share it in case others haven't heard it before. 



















 It seems unfair, counter-productive, and not a valid way of seeing what the actual PARTY members want. 




















































































 Okay, there was one moment that made my jaw drop at the utter stupidity of the scientists.

Miller's Planet... massive time dilation. The team went down to get the information.  Notice the massive waves.  Brand gets the idea in her head to go get data and gets stuck.  CASE is commanded to get her.  He suddenly transforms into SUPER-SPEED MODE!  

My jaw dropped in the theater.  I turned to my wife, and whispered, "What the HELL?!"

Why didn't they just send CASE down?  He could pilot the lander; he could go into super-speed mode; make assessments; get the data; come back; and it wouldn't have been 28 years lost.  Maybe half that.   














 That's the only thing I can think of. In America, we'll have a foreign song become popular occasionally. 



























































 I was raised in the Assemblies of God church.  My mother is still a registered AG pastor, in fact.  Come 16 years ago, my parents divorced, and I backslid.  I met my wife 13 years ago, and she and her family are very Catholic.

I converted through RCIA, and received all the sacraments at the Easter Vigil Mass in 2003.  The one thing I have never agreed with, and have not participated with is confession.

Why should we go through a mediary, like a priest, when we can go strait to God, and ask for forgiveness?  Didn't make sense then, and it doesn't make sense now.

 I was a high school senior employed at a theater when that came out. I must have watched that movie 10-15 times in the theater. It was so NEW and mind-blowing at the time. 




 Star Wars Episode V: A New Hope

It was the father of modern-day sci-fi. 




 "Remote" or "Remote control". 




 Money.

I doubt their paid in pillow mints and tiny bottles of toiletries.  




 That made me laugh so hard the first time I saw him. No respect for him at all. Haha! 




 Up until recently, it's been Republican.

I've gone more Independent/Libertarian lately. 




 I don't know the baby on the right is smoking; baby on the left was not THAT funny at all. ;-) 




 Yep--same here. 




 Why the HELL did the parish allow some unprofessional moron do that?! It boggles my mind. 




 Super hi-res photo? 




 It all comes down to what people define "dance" as. To me, twerking isn't dancing; it's looking like a damn fool. 




 Bing: Translating Ebonics for your benefit. 




 Meh, I knew he'd have to die. I wouldn't consider his death a "happy" ending. More like a bitter-sweet ending.

I felt sorry for the guy in the beginning. Then he became an asshole. Then a complete dick. Then at the end, realized he was too far gone. I felt empathy for the poor bastard. Like I sort of did for Hitler after watching "Downfall". 




 Premium is worth it to me. I have it on all day during work, and all night as I sleep.  I love me some music. Haha! 




 Yep. The download tracks is awesome for when one has no wifi and a crappy data signal.

I never get ads though since I got premium. Weird... 




 Facebook is no longer required. 




 I'm a Spotify user myself.

I've used several in the past: iTunes, Rhapsody, Milk Music, etc... 




 Man, I frickin' love my GatorGrip. 




 So. Much. Plastic. Surgery. 




 Yeah--I'm hoping they are keeping a lot up their sleeves. 









 Is this more of that Common Core math? 




 He might have kicked them off in a fit of joy. 




 Seems like they just took Reddington's brain, and used it for Ultron.  LOL 




 Real interplanetary beings probably love all the decoys.  ;-) 




 Yes, that was my assumption as well (see video description). 




 I pretty much say that in the video description.  Also the reason why I put UFO in quotation marks.

It ***was*** unidentified... until I saw it moving. 














 The dress-wearing llama.  




 I agree. I hate games that practically require puchases.

"Flow" and "Flow Bridges" are fun to waste time with. 




 It's just simple politeness.  You're telling them to have a good night('s rest). 




 No. I was too busy working by that age.  




 From a bowl... with a spoon... 




 What is?  The fact that they serve Pepsi products instead of Coca-Cola? 









 Yeah--because THAT wasn't happening for the 30 minutes before I made this picture.

I don't agree with them doing so, but I don't think a government should FORCE them to do anything. Period.

 As a convert, I've often wondered if Jesus was telling us to pray that exact prayer, or just to say prayers LIKE that. The wording is sort of misleading.  




 "(sic)" by Slipknot. 




 It gets opened all the way, and used as a makeshift plate. 




 When did you know you fucked up with that unnecessary comma? 




 I was reading the daily readings today, and it reminded me of this difference. 




 It even SAYS that on the green/red/yellow band trailer screens.

 Great decision, Disney! 




 Yes, I'm a registered Republican, and they're been pissing me off lately.  So much so, that I'm seriously thinking about unregistering and voting more Libertarian. 









 Looks the same; just flipped. 




 She was so hot... what a waste.

[Just remember kids...](http://cdn.meme.am/instances/24368947.jpg)

 Phantom Menace.

1. Bloated, unnecessary storyline.

2. Jar-Jar Binks.

3. Too much politics.

4. Midi-fucking-clorians.

5. Podracing was pointless. 




 Born with a penis, you're a man; born with a vagina, you're a woman.

 It wasn't obvious... hence my comment and the upvotes it received.

 Yep.  [MyFitnessPal](http://www.MyFitnessPall.com) has helped me tremendously.  I'm on day 210 today. 




 Be sure you have some GOOD boudin while you're down. 




 Yep.  You got one from me.  Alabama is worse. 




 I've lived in [Louisiana](http://www.mapsofworld.com/usa/area-codes/maps/louisiana-area-code-map.jpg) (225 area code) my entire life of 34 years.

I've never eaten, snapping turtle, raccoon, nutria, opossum, muskrat, armadillo, or goat.

All the rest, I've had.  This place must be down in the bayou.  504 area code is New Orleans.  That's surprising.  I'd have guessed it was from the 337 area code. 




 Poor Dwight... Jim's gotten even worse with the pranks! 




 I won't lie; that was pretty damn cool. 














 Same here. I've ordered from ProFlowers 2 or 3 times. I've decided to go to a local florist from now on. Not as convenient as the internet, but at least the flowers won't be delivered uncut in a damn box. 




 While no longer cannon, the Dark Empire series was great. Read those in graphic novel form.

 Sickening.

NO ONE'S faith or religious buildings should be treated this way.  Even a Satanic cult's building and faith.  I pray for them, but I wouldn't beat them up strictly for being a Satanist.

God is love, and Jesus taught us to treat others as we would treat ourselves. 




 My wife and I binge-watched it on Netflix over a few months from start to finish. It was awesome! 
























 Re - glue it? 




 Bwahahaha! 




 1. Never go to bed angry.

2. True love is putting the other over oneself. If that happens on both sides, you're a happy couple.  If it's only one-sided, cut your losses, and find the right one. 




 Boy, that's a unique-looking lamp. 




 Psh, I'm married, and have 3 kids... can't afford a next gen console... much less have time to play it.  Hahaha! 




 No, but I miss it sometimes. 




 Life Insurance Policy 




 Red Dead Redemption 




 2008 Ford Focus SE (Black)

2010 Mazda CX-9 (Black) 




 The child-catcher from Chitty-Chitty Bang-Bang always creeped me out.  

And the beginning scene from The Peanut Butter Hair Solution. 




 Yeah, not chant, but that was simply amazing. Great acoustics/reverb in that location as well.

Those harmonies were TIGHT! 




 Amen!  They don't seem to understand that we get tired of trying and not succeeding. 









 Nah, my daughter will drive my Ford Focus probably.  She can connect her phone via Bluetooth, and will only be allowed to CALL people; no texting.

I drive on the interstate, and see people texting, browsing the internet, e-mailing, etc. on their phones while we're going 70+ mph.  I'm just thinking, "WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?!" 









 She'd grind that transmission to a pulp in Baton Rouge, Louisiana's stop-n-go traffic. 




 Really?  I didn't know they believed that.  Learned something new. 




 I have a 15yo already talking about driving... she lives with her damn face glued to her phone.  This is the shit I'm afraid of. 




 The Legend of the Drunken Master was unbelievable! I was flabbergasted when I heard him say he had to deliberately slow the scenes and moves down some to make them distinguishable to movie-goers. 




 Where all the other techno-fads go. 




 Funny, but [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JElywbkSbY) is the very first thing I thought of when I first heard of the Wii U. 




 No, you stumbled upon the yet-to-be-announced Ritz Tacos from Taco Bell. 




 Good find.  This video made me subscribe. 




 LOL 




 I've seen those!  I've also seen a 12-13yo girl walking around with shorts that had "paint"-like handprints on both ass-cheeks... as if someone with painted hands put hands on her ass.

She was a damn pre-teen! 




 What the hell is wrong with our society...?! 




 I've heard of about 80% of these, and all of them are fucking disgusting. 




 I've never been there, but I still chuckled. 




 Yeah, I've heard of the Gospel of Judas.

Not to mention an entire "bible" written by Lucifer himself. 




 I've seen someone eating cereal from a bowl while driving on the interstate. FROM A BOWL.  That take's two damn hands to do! 




 281,694 (at my work computer). 




 Ah, well... there you have it.  Thanks, /u/Bremstralung. 














 LMFAO!  I forgot about that.  How ridiculous! 




 Okay, that was pretty badass!  Good find, /u/Dennepis ! 




 Student body crap were always pointless positions. 




 In that case, have an "upvote"! 




 Was that supposed to be English they were speaking? 




 I guess I'm referring more to "blind from birth" blind. 




 I can't tell you how many times I've healed major bosses by summoning the same element as the boss (e.g., summoning Shiva on an ice-elemental boss). 




 Wouldn't that have killed all of the caster's companions as well? 




 Look!  It's Kung Lao's grandfather! 




 But I wasn't sure if it was similar to unused muscles becoming atrophied.  If a blind person doesn't really USE their eyes, do parts of the ocular system become "atrophied"?  That's kind of what I was thinking. 




 I wasn't sure what triggered the dilation.

Seems odd for the body to expend energy to do something that serves no real purpose (to a blind person, that is). 









 "[S]he doesn't know how to use the shells..." 




 It's no iLuminate, but it was good! 




 Sounds like a group of guys saying "Hey!" over and over again. 




 As an American, I vote for Miller Lite over Bud Lite.  Bud beers are gross.

My favorite beer of all-time is [Almaza](http://www.lacproducts.com/products/beer/Almaza.jpg). 




 No conflict there.  Forget the damn donuts! 




 Send myself a certified check for a large sum of money in the mail. 




 I stopped it when I heard the stupid-ass "Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!" junk in the background.  I can't stand that crap. 




 I have one too.  Damn thing over-boils onto my microwave every time.  That fill line is bogus. 




 Good Lord!  Don't eat them!  Cover them in clear coat to preserve them for a museum of never-seen-again objects! 




 For the life of me, I can't remember. 




 Yes, I am a conservatively-leaning Libertarian in Louisiana.

I used to love Jindal.  He's done a lot of good things for this state.

Lately, however, he's been saying some batty things. 




 As an American who doesn't watch soccer... this is what soccer is to me.  Acting... on a field... with a ball... 




 ...yeah... this was on the front page... 




 ***Mission: Impossible*** -- Great Movie.

***Mission: Impossible II*** -- Horrible Sequel.

***Mission: Impossible III*** -- Improved Sequel.

***Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol*** -- As good as the original.

***Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation*** -- I've got high hopes; don't let me down! 




 Haha!  Nice one, /u/MechaGrimm ! 




 I don't get it. 




 I started working at McDonald's the week after I turned 15. It wasn't a great job, but it was a job. As a very young person, your options are very limited. You take what you can get, and you don't bitch about it. 




 Hehe, poor person hates their cubicle,  and dreams of the beach. 




 Sunday morning, Tuesday morning, and Thursday morning.

I have some stubble on the between-days... enough that it's noticeable, but whatever. 




 Probably because no one watched it. 




 That's pretty ingenious, actually. 




 ...God, I love the internet.  HAHAHA! 




 Hehehe... ya got me.  Read the title, said, "WHAT?!".  Then looked at the pic, and said, "Ooooohhhh...." 




 No, people can be offended and say they are offended. The people that think being offended is against their rights is what annoys me. "That white man said the word 'nigger', and it offended me. I'm taking him to court!"

That kind of shit is what clogs our judicial system and makes us the lawsuit-crazy world we are. 




 This.

People think they have a right to not be offended.  "I'm offended by [whatever]!"  "Well, good for you.  Now shut the hell up." 




 Happy cake day, /u/problatikal.

You get karma from me, since I only got 15 on my cake day.  :-( 




 I know, right?! 




 See the brief clip of her doing do in my post above. 




 They can be linked together to form a dual-bladed lightsaber.

 The fight scenes were the only good parts of that movie.  Acting was "bleh", story was "bleh". 




 I love Madeon's music.  "The City" is probably my favorite with "Finale" being a close second. 




 How about just limiting it to one-vote-per-person and legal voters?

Sounds like a LEGAL FRICKIN' PLAN TO ME! 




 Younger kids are more liberal-leaning because they are lazy and want things GIVEN to them instead of working hard to earn it.  They demand instant gratification. 




 Haha!  You know what I mean! 




 Yep, same here.  And she isn't as attractive as I remember her bring.  Now, she comes off as just being needy and whiney. 




 Great show.  Had a little crush on here. 




 Really?  Looks like a potato to me. 




 Man, Epona has some great muscle dexterity to hold that rearing pose so still for so long!  




 Boom Beach, AdVenture Capitalist, Link Dots, and SimCity BuildIt.  




 I prefer cane syrup myself.

My family gets together every year and make our own, but the Steen's brand here in the South is a good alternative. 




 Man, I friggin' loved the Wraith Squadron books.  Some of my favorite characters came from those books.  I have never laughed out loud while reading like I had at parts of those books.

 




 Thanks.  Apparently, unlike everyone else in /r/Catholicism, I'm not 100% well-versed with the catechism.  I'm assuming from his/her comment that /u/o_hai_mark can quote it like the Bible.  ((eyeroll)) 




 Let me play Devil's Advocate here... does the catechism ever describe self-pleasure as being a sin? 




 Good point!  Zedd is more of a "hippy", and loves food! 









 True. I do like the WoT series better overall... although it can be a tad too descriptive sometimes.  The SoT got a little repetitive and deus ex machina sometimes. 




 Not a problem for me with any embarrassing site, because I back all the way out, and purge my history every time I use my browser. 




 I'm gonna assume you mean:
 "I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass."

Gandalf is making three very specific references as both warning and challenge to the Balrog. by identifying himself as a servant of the secret fire (or Flame impersishable), Gandalf is identifying himself as a Maiar, an embodied angelic servant of the Valar protecting the light of Creation that Eru Iluvatar (or God) has set to burn at the centre of Arda (Earth).

Wieldor of the flame of Anor is a reference to his ability to draw on the power of the sun possibly through the Ring of Fire Narya but maybe also through his own divine origins.

Finally as he refers to the Balrog as the Flame of Udun, he informs the Balrog that he knows it to be a corrupted Maiar in the service of Morgoth from the earliest time when he resided as Melkor in his dark fortress of Utumno broken by the Valar at the awakening of the Elves. He orders it to retreat (go back to the shadows) or face the consequences of divine conflict and final judgement before the Valar Mandos the fate of all slain creatures. 




 Just finished re-reading the good part of the Sword of Truth series (leave out the later-published Richard and Kahlan series), and have started re-reading the Wheel of Time series again.

Which of the two characters listed above is your favorite, and why? 




 I've been looking forward to my cakeday ever since I learned what a cakeday was. I joined Reddit after I got sick of 4chan. I was getting to old for 4chan's shit... just like m00t apparently has.

I've enjoyed my first year here at Reddit. I learn about events before most other people. I see cool Internet things before they become mainstream. Etc.

Thanks, fellow Redditors, and I look forward to year 2! 




 So TODAY is my cake day? Why use past tense verbs, Reddit? 




 It says "celebrated" which is past tense. 









 "I love you." 




 Because it's an easy religion. It excuses pretty much any bad behavior. 




 A non-standard 9V battery I would assume. 




 Apply directly to the forehead. 




 Screw that!  It probably costs $25 for that stupid thing.

I'll take a $5.99 triple-chocolate meltdown any day. 




 "Beeps in tenth" 




 Why hello, Facebook image from a month ago. 




 1st Try: "Oops, okay... try again."

2nd Try: "Yeah--okay, we're leaving." 




 That's what most of these "prank" YouTube channels think they can do.  "It's just a prank!"  "It's for a video!"  "It's for YouTube!"

"Yeah--well, walking up and kissing my wife on the lips isn't funny, you asshole." 




 It's not Christmas now until I hear this song:

[Happy Holidays (Beef Wellington Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XJjW_Gelmo) 




 This guy is a dick. 




 We keep ours that way because we had kids.  Now that they are old enough to know better, we keep it like that out of habit. 




 Yay for stereotypes! 




 Saw that it was Ray Williams Johnson's channel and came back.

How DARE you spread RWJ crap over Reddit. 




 No, she was hired to do the work by the parish. 




 With severe skepticism.  




 So... a gay, black woman has it hardest of all then, eh? 
























 "MOVE! GET OUT THE WAY! I GOTTA GO TO THE BATHROOM!" 














 I remember when he didn't have the Mr. Fusion on the back, nor the ... ?coolant tubes/wires? on the doors.  I was stoked to see him finally get them made to be on there.  Seeing him add onto it more and more over the years has been fun. 




 Oh, no.  I know this guy.  I see him all over Baton Rouge, LA.  Hope it's a flat, and not something more... sinister.  I love seeing his car around town. 




 She's too.... cute.  Psyloche should be a... sultry, hot woman.  




 Had them chronically in high school. Both big toes.  I was in the marching band.  The roll-stepping of marching band suuuuucked with my toes. 




 It's sickening that the server got $7k for serving a normal table super-expensive wine/champagne.

It's not like that shit is served any different than the $12 bottle of liquor.  Percentage tipping--especially forced tipping--is so stupid. 




 Best laugh since ["Dad at Comedy Barn"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Y4keqTV6w).

 This is an extremely common occurrence... why do people keep posting these pics? 




 LMFAO!!! 




 That's creepy as hell.

Not to mention Bina48's derp face from time to time. 




 Ugh--same here.  I can't stand that shit. 




 Hurr-dee-durr... 




 The "Chewbacca" thing had me laughing.  Haha!  Thanks for that! 




 The blacks in my area were ALL about the first-black-President agenda.  I promise you.  That's all we heard. 




 I bet everyone will jump on the First-Female-President bandwagon just like they did the First-Black-President bandwagon. 




 "Good trade. Thanks!" 




 Into my own bank account. We pay too much as it is.

We're taxed when we earn money (income tax) AND when we spend it (sales tax).

 Are you in the business, or did you randomly get mailed?

Their local rep came by our office, but all we got was an stress-reliever "ass" to squeeze, and some pens.  ***LOL*** 




 Yep, I actually specified the [**Haiku**](http://www.bigassfans.com/products/haiku/) for a job a few months ago.

The biggest one I've specified was for a distribution warehouse.  It was the [**Powerfoil 8**](http://www.bigassfans.com/products/powerfoil-8/). 




 What the hell am I looking for/at? 




 I do electrical design, and I will never forget the first time I heard of this manufacturer over the phone.

"We want to use a Big Ass Fan."

"Haha-yeah, you need a big one."

"No, it's called a Big Ass Fan.  That's who makes them."

"Wait--seriously?  HAHAHA!" 




 "Official" my ass. 




 I hate it when Hulu does that!  




 Glad to hear I'm not the only one. 




 With the exception of The Flash, I haven't found a CW show I actually like.

The Flash has a little of the cheese added on top, but it fits with the characters, and isn't distracting... Except for Iris... she's a moron. 




 Couldn't agree more about The Arrow.  Finished Season 2 on Netflix, but not sure I care anymore to watch Season 3. 




 I just finished S1E2, and I'm wondering if it's worth it.

Told my wife, who was watching it with me, that the acting and dialogue is like that of a CW show.  Turns out, I was right.  HAHA!

tl;dr -- Should I watch this show? 




 "It's impossible for a minority to be racist." 




 Even more true...

We're all just electrons migrating from the Big Bang.

 Okay, that was pretty damn funny.  Haha!  Thanks! 




 I had a plumber tell me that the only "flushable wipe" that won't screw up your plumbing system is toilet paper.

These things labeled as "flushable wipes" keep him quite busy with unclogging toilets and pipes.

Have fun. 




 There--now I have!  Thanks! 




 This is why the internet needs a "sarc-mark". 




 CPS needs to take that kid into protective custody. Damn. 




 The something of Prince Phillip...? 




 Yes, public transportation works in cities where everything is clumped together.

I live in Baton Rouge, LA, and everything we need to get to is spread out somewhat.  I also have to go to meetings a lot--sometimes at the drop of a hat.

Public transportation doesn't work well for me, or my city. 




 This wasn't "WILD", there was no "chase" to be seen, and I have no idea what "distance" you're talking about.  This isn't even "funny", so it doesn't belong in /r/funny.

 I keep telling my sister--who is a smoker--that it ages you prematurely.  She doesn't agree (of course). 




 Wow, your great-grandmother looks amazing!  She looks younger than your grandmother!  Your grandmother a smoker? 




 Ah, interesting.  Thanks! 




 I never understood how they can "bathe" in dirt....

 Man, The Sims has gotten weird since I stopped playing after The Sims 2.

I ignored it as best I could. She was 14yo. LOL  Didn't want to embarrass her.

 That's what I thought (and did). I guessed correctly!  




 I know! He's an awesome priest! 




 It's my name as well. Hehe! 




 Baton Rouge, LA diocese.

St. Stephen the Martyr 




 We have a new priest this year, and he uses incence.  I am a convert, and have never dealt with it.

After blessing the consecration, he turns to the congregation, bows, blesses each side, and bows again.

My question: Do I bow the first time; as he blesses me; or the last bow?  Do I make the sign of the cross?  Do I do nothing?

I'm so confused, and it appears the majority of the congregation is as well based upon their responses.  Haha! 




 Well, guess it DID have enough spin. Didn't appear as such, but you were there. Cool! I thought the runner AND catcher did great jobs! 




 Anyone under the age of 18... 




 I agree. I mainly posted it for the song. 




 Cool, but kind of a one-trick pony. Can only do wailing notes... not shredding. 




 Yes. I was an usher in a previous job. 




 You owe me a beer.

 Not as bad as I would have thought, actually.

I'd have to move though, as I live in Baton Rouge, LA. 




 The ball was bouncing very low to the ground, and hits a wall.  Not sure what would make it pop up 3-4' in the air. 




 The angle(s) don't seem to be right for that to happen. 




 That red-head was so hot back then.  I can't remember the video, but there was one where she was practically naked on a bed.  Damn. 




 Hey, man, at least you're writing original music!  Keep it up! 




 I think you meant: [*"Where tha white women at?"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=493pL_Vbtnc) 




 My 15 year old would do awesome on this one.  My wife and I were born in '81, and we play 90's music all the friggin' time! 









 [...whoa...](http://weknowgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/black-people-reaction-to-magic.gif) 




 I'll stick with Spotify.  Tidal is sponsored/backed by several artists I can't stand.  It also REQUIRES a "30-day" trial (i.e., there is no free service with commercials).  I'm not giving you my credit card number to get a 30-day trial.  Screw you. 




 Whether the jump was "illegal" or not, I'm glad the umpire called him safe for one reason:

Someone tossed the loose ball back to the catcher instead of making him scramble for it.  The runner probably would've been safe otherwise.

 It's apparently all over Pearl Jam's community forum from someone who knew her from a  Facebook group or something. 




 I loved these shorts!  They were some of my favorites.

There was also a counting short that used colored sand to create an African vibe.  The background singing was something like, "uh-DOONG-a-ding-a-ding; uh-DOONG-a-ding-a-ding..."

For the life of me, I can NOT find that video anywhere... or find someone who remembers it. 




 I actually prefer the [knuckle/gap method](http://ehealthbook.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/days-in-month.jpg) for months.  Much easier. 




 In his defense, he probably can't see worth shit.  LOL 




 This "Kim" woman apparently died very recently from an illness.  Must be why this video popped up again. 




 I agree.  A little too much hype for this video too. 




 Didn't notice... now I have an excuse to re-watch it.  Hehehehe!

Edit: Pretty sure she's wearing a bra under her cut-off. 




 I so want to see them!  No one comes to Louisiana anymore... ever... 









 Cool song with a cool video! 




 Maybe you should blame your math teachers for shorting you on your education. 




 I was never told during my time in RCIA (I am a convert) that one is supposed to maintain silence on Good Friday.  Huh... go figure. 




 Ha! Brilliant!  




 Haha!  Good work, /u/mardfet! 




 Because publishers, production companies, etc. only exist to make a profit.

 Amen! 









 Did you voice a Conservative view-point in /r/politics?  Nah, you'd have 100+ if that were the case. 




 Android... screw Apple and it's closed system that requires iTunes to do everything. 




 Yes.  The world is a world of generali(z/s)ations.

Side-note: as a generalized, lazy American, I make it a point not to learn how every version of every word is spelled in every language.  Who has time for that? 




 That's my point entirely.  The way one carries themselves speaks wonders.  If you're talking on your phone instead of serving me my food; complaining to a coworker about how much you hate being at work instead of checking out my groceries; etc, you're annoying as hell. 




 Yes.  It does.  Hence the term "generali***Z***ing". 




 My experience based upon most Mexicans that I've encountered. 




 When 90% of the people you meet act that way, the small 10% gets lumped in. Sorry. That's how it works. 




 Precisely.  




 It was a tongue-in-cheek, rhetorical question based upon the fact that most Mexicans show little interest in adapting, and want the U.S. to be more like Mexico. 




 If one dresses, speaks, and acts a certain way, they are labeled as such in my mind.

In my city (Baton Rouge, LA; but New Orleans is worse), GENERALLY SPEAKING, blacks are lazy, low-work-ethic, governmental-freeloaders who do nothing but leech off the system while not contributing.  If they DO get jobs, they're on their damn cellphones or talking to each other rather than assisting the customers.

Want me to treat you like a valid citizen?  Then BECOME one. BBM 




 So you must not like the Mexicans in the U.S. then, eh? 




 /r/politics is a liberal circle-jerk. 




 The REALLY ending, damnit! 




 Obviously, someone who is way too close. 




 Boom Beach, AdVenture Capitalist, and Final Fantasy: Record Keeper. 




 Lump sum. Government's going to take a crap-ton anyway.  Might as well only have one year of screwed-up taxes than fifty. 




 I don't know that I daydream or expand on any of them.

To me, though, the most fleshed-out would have to be the Wheel of Time world. So vast and diverse. 




 I work off of Sherwood Forest, and it was pretty damn scary. 




 11:00?  It was 9:30 here when we got the tornado warning. 




 I work in the Airline/Sherwood Forrest area, and it was pretty freakin' scary for a bit there, and I'm a grown man.  HAHA! 









 Yeah, I watched a few.  The K.I.S.S. one is definitely the best. 




 I have a [Gerber knife](http://www.gerber-tools.com/images/Gerber-Mini-Fast-Draw-22-01525-600x500.jpg) I keep in my back pocket.  I use it a LOT actually. 




 Real men aren't Cub's fans, so no. 




 Damn, that was funny.  Subscribing! 









 Keys and car remotes.  That's it... 'cause I'm a **MAN**, damnit. 




 Proof that performing outdoors is hard.

Timing was off.  When the snares can't even hit at the same time, ya got problems.  Tubas were going for "blat" sound over tonal quality. 




 True.  Every now and then, our music director picks a cheesy one.  But overall, we do decent music, and get complimented on our music.

I, for one, feel like we need to do more Latin music than we do though. 




 She just proclaimed to the world that she's a giant whore.  Your parents must be so proud! 




 That looks fan-made... please tell me that's fan-made. 




 Fun idea, but it'll never happen. 




 Never heard of Fozby.com. but I'm going to assume it's a satirical site. 




 I've sung in the at my church since I converted 13 years ago.  We mostly sing out of the Gather Comprehensive and Spirit   Song books that the congregation has copies of.

We rarely go out-of-book, because all of our priests have cared about participation. We sing to minister, not to perform. They are a congregation, not an audience.

I've been to other churches, and I know exactly what you mean. 




 ...so...Madonna then? 



















 Um--no they shouldn't. 




 I never noticed how poorly-edited that was.

Palpatine reacts before he even moves from the Force-push.  Shouldn't it be a reaction to actual movement--not a reaction THEN movement? 




 All that put into the atmosphere will fuel the "climate change" morons for a few more years.

 Yeah, I gathered as much from her IMDB.  Still don't know who she is. 




 The guy in the white shirt had an expression that was a mixture of, "Way to go, moron," and, "Wow--he was an asshole."

 Every time this video pops up again, I can't get that horrid sound out of my memory.  Stop subjecting people to the sound... THE SOUND!... ***THE SOUND!!!!!*** 




 9.X% 




 Put in some dog meat...  If none is available, substitute cheese.

What kind of cook book would sub a dairy for a protein?! 




 * 23.44%
* 26.38%
* 29.30% 

Are the percentages they should actually print with the numbers they provided.

I never follow those anyway.  I double the tax, and round up/down to the nearest dollar (depending on service). 




 Y'know, I normally am fine with the one-hour thing, but this was never told to me when I went through RCIA thirteen years ago. Interesting. 




 Isn't the Eucharist fast only 30 minutes?  If you don't get there by 11:15 or so, they're all gone.  They used to be tasty Mary Lee donuts, but now they're always "meh" Krispe Kreme.  I pass. 




 I go to noon (last one of the Sunday), and if you don't get there to grab one BEFORE mass starts, they don't have any after.  It's always only after 10:00 mass.

 Thanks for this.  Just got another half-gallon of Tin Roof a few days ago.  Into the trash it will go. 




 If they blocked my way to a class I have paid for with my own money--used gas I've paid for with my own money--used my personal time to go to--I'd call the cops.

They can protest, but they aren't allowed to block people.  What a waste of air and energy. 




 Wow... that was pretty bad.  Hopefully, it's just chalked up to live conditions and not the fact that they're just frickin' too old to do this now.  Jeez! 




 ....aaaaaaand he was fired the next day for failing to maintain OSHA safety regulations. 




 By "mashed", you mean "replaced".  I was expecting some form of syncing original audio to new video. 




 I'm overweight, but I'm not morbidly obese.  Ya know what thought?  I walk when I shop.  Lazy ass mofos. 




 Those motorized carts should require a scan of a handicap tag of some sort... stop letting morbidly obese people use them; give them a reason to get off their fat asses.
