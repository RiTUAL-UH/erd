 Marine Systems Engineer here.  I'm just about to graduate from a 4 year curriculum at the US Merchant Marine Academy.  The program I've been a part of has introduced me to a wide range of engineering.  We start off learning the terminology used aboard ships and going over a core curriculum of calculus, physics, chemistry, electrical, and thermodynamics courses.  We spend an entire year as cadets on a number of ships in both a four month and eight month periods.  I was on four different ships during my sea time.  We then go over a number of advanced calculus, physics and electrical courses, we take classes in systems design, machine design, and, in the systems program we have a Capstone design project for which we go through the entire design process of designing systems for a vessel.   
























 Hah, figures someone beat me to this.  We considered using one of these in a marine engineering design project.  They are MASSIVE.   
























 Wow there's a lot of awesome in this picture. 
























 Shame.

Michael Fassbender was fantastic, and the film itself was masterfully crafted with a powerful message, but in the end that movie had me emotionally floored for about a week. 
























 My ex is a shy, sensitive girl who had gone through a rough childhood with an emotionally abusive mother.  We had first met as pen pals in high school, so over the years she had opened up to me with a lot about her past that she had never told anyone else.  We started dating when she moved to the city I was going to school in.  I was studying engineering at a military academy at the time, so with the demands of my school I could only really see her on the weekends.  With the stress of her past, and her living paycheck to paycheck in a rough city, she would break down every once in a while and call me just to try to get through whatever was bringing her down.  One night she called me during the week, and she seemed especially upset.  For some reason I had a light load with my schoolwork that night, so I told her I'd call her right back, took a taxi to the train station and got on a train before I called her.  On my way over she told me just about everything that was on her mind.  It was late in December, but after I got to her apartment I waited outside talking to her until she had vented everything on her mind.  I explained the cars going by by telling her some guys in the next room over were watching a loud movie.  I waited until she told me she felt better before I told her where I was.  She was on the fourth floor, but she ran down all four flights in pajamas to meet me at the door.  We talked in her apartment for about an hour, but, because of my academy's curfew, I had to take a late train back to school that same night.
