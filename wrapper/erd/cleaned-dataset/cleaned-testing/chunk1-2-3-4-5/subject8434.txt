 Glad they took him out second half.  




 Ya I did seem he slap his legs or just get pissed if when someone made a small mistake. For example someone passed the ball to the other team he got pissed and just walked away instead of getting the ball back. 









 He didn't do so well tonight he seemed lazy and didn't try to run the ball even tho the ball opportunity wasn't gonna happen he still needs to make the runs. It seems like he doesn't believe in his team.  




 I did, I was great game to watch my first soccer game too!! 




 I am in millersville md if your going to the game we can meet there maybe?  




 Are you serious?! 




 I just wanna watch the game for tonight you can change the password after tonight willing to provide identity info.

 What if we take what our body produces and enhances it? 














 What do they say? 




 Even then the pace of the European game is much faster then the American basketball  









 Sims and fifa 




 Time won't be wasted tho since they have extra balls that they throw in regardless. 




 Not really trying to steal one just let the stadium allowing to take one 




 A good ball once in a whole never hurts 




 And how much do they pay for those balls I doubt it's 200 dollars and if so is it not about the fans. The whole point of the game is let the fans enjoy themselves and have an attachment to the game and the players. What's not better then a free ball from their favorite footballer to keep that fan hood? 




 I say about 3 -4 balls go into stands every game to the billions of dollars fifa gets yearly.  




 Usually fans throw the ball back on the pitch and then there's two balls on the field which makes a delay either way time will be wasted. I believe we should be allowed to keep a ball for memory of the game like other sports do it's kinda unfair that we have to return and only have a cup with a team name to show for it. 




 Wasting time? There's ball boys that have extra balls. 




 That's what I was thinking  




 To hell with rules if a famous footballer kicks a 200 dollar ball to my face hell ya imma keep it  














 If it's approved when will it finish?

 I'm American and go to a public high school with very little blacks, they're racist here and I can't go a day without hearing a negative tone towards my skin color and I live on the suburbs. I used to go to a very big high school with many blacks and they are just as racist because I'm darker than most.
