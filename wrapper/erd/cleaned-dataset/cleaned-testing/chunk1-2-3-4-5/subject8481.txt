 I seriously doubt your bookmark's bar actually saves you any time.  Typing in a web address would be much faster than sifting through all that shit. 









 I don't know if the dude doing the spread eagle is actually tied on and about to get ripped apart or if he's just really fucking committed and a badass.  




 Mr. Freeman, it's an absolute pleasure having you here. Now tell me, would you rather fight 100 duck sized horses or one horse sized duck? Since, as God, you're the only one that can actually make it happen!

 It's not cancer, spiders or an abscessed tooth.  According to the dentist, the nerve on one of my molars died and then became infected.  So, the guy who said "blood and puss" is today's winner.  The only reason it ever got to this point is because I'm a Canadian that was traveling in the U.S. and couldn't see a dentist until I got home.  Thanks for your concern everyone, I'm on antibiotics and was even prescribed percocet for the pain so I'm high as a kite. 




 Thanks for the suggestion! 




 I agree that it doesn't belong in /r/askscience.  It is posted in /r/science. 









 I once sent a customer a text saying "goodnight beautiful" that was intended for my wife. He still greets me with "hello beautiful" every time he calls. 
























 Posting about it same day? Dude, too soon. Don't you have some family stuff to attend to? 




 Rocket salad?  I think they meant *roquette* salad, which is a kind of arugula.  I bet the Italian menu says roquette, but they just assumed rocket would be the English version. 




 "But I don't want to ride the elevator. " 




 The smiling man video from the other day. I had to change my pants after that one.  




 The company I work for was featured on How it's Made. The producers genuinely want to know how everything is built from beginning to end. We must have spoken with their writers a dozen times so that they had a deep understanding of the entire process. It was quite the experience.  




 I travel for work constantly, I'm actually writing this in an airport. My best tip is to eliminate checked baggage. This won't help if you're going on vacation, but I can't tell you how many time this has saved me. 

Tight connect? Your luggage doesn't get left behind. 

Want to grab an earlier connecting flight? The first thing they'll ask is if you have checked luggage. 

If you eliminate checked luggage, you can literally walk off the plane and to your car or hop into a cab without breaking stride. 

This goes without saying, but the airline can't lose your luggage if its with you. 

Note:  Please use only approved size luggage for carry on travel. If I see you on a flight with your whole life in multiple suitcases, I'll recline my seat into your lap as far as it can go.

 I literally just got wood.  




 I literally just teared up in awe. 




 People who board flights out of turn. When they call seating zone 3, if you're in zone 4, the agent at the counter should turn you away. But no one ever gets turned away! They just let them right on the plane like a reward for being bold enough to try or something. As a guy who travels for work, this drives me nuts.  
























 Thought this was going to be about Syria. 




 It's amazing what difference a good actor vs. a bad actor can make.  I immediately felt connected to this coffeemate guy.  The lines didn't feel forced and his deliver was perfect.  Bryan Cranston is an amazing actor because he can be anyone, not just Walter White. 




 Having to wait until 21 to drink legally is insane.  You guys in the states need to come visit us in Canada more often... or visit just about anywhere else in the world and get a drink before you're 21. 




 Take her on The Hulk at Universal Studios. She will shit herself.  




 I found the audio in this scene amazing. It really sounded modern and classical at the same time. 




 TIL what Dr. Seuss looked like.

 One of the first cars I ever drove was a 1973 Datsun 240z. I drove it from 2001-2004 since my dad thought it would be a good car to cut my teeth on, especially since you can open the hood and actually learn about how the thing works. Today's cars are basically computers under the hood.

I remember it felt like you were literally sitting on the ground it was so low.  It also used to get insanely hot in the cab because all of the heat from the engine had to go somewhere. 




 ITT more questions.  
























 A layman-friendly explanation to something (which I think is) complicated or technical is exactly what this post is about. 









 Leftover pulled pork with pancakes.  Something about maple syrup, pulled pork and light fluffy pancakes that is just magical. 




 I own stocks in several large American banks and insurance corporations.  Should I be pulling my money out?  Recently these stocks have been doing well and have been projected to continue to do well.  

I invest through a large investment firm and they're telling me to stay put, but they also don't make anything when I'm not investing. 




 If you read the whole series you'll notice that venoms features become more and more distorted. By the end he looks very much like OP's version. 




 Hodor.

 Is ya a screecher? 




 I really hope that no harm comes to this woman as a result of this. It's not terribly uncommon for women that contradict social norms in a position like this to have acid thrown at them or to be burned.  
























 The same thing happened to me on my birthday. I got multiple bottles of whiskey, whiskey glasses, whiskey stones for keeping it cool and apparently no one had discussed what to get me. 

Still unsure about the connoisseur vs. alcoholic part though.  




 I'm 32 and I never thought that I would wind up working with my dad, but here we are.  I'm now one of the partners in the business and doing very well. Sometimes following the family business can work to your advantage, but don't expect it to fall into your lap. As the son of the boss I have to work twice as hard as others but I'm also the best at my job and most likely to take over. Surprisingly, I really enjoy my work and my dad and I work well together.

I also never could have imagined getting married and having kids, especially since I was never really outgoing. It's highly recommended; best thing I ever did.  




 I don't know about bison, but with African buffalo the herd is all that matters. Often when one is injured and trying to follow the herd it will be cast out by the other buffalo and even attacked so that it won't draw predators towards the rest of the herd.  




 The Jackson family, all of them. They are trying so hard to cling to something, but come off looking like the most greedy and uncaring family ever. 




 Thanks for the reply! 




 I noticed from your photos that there were no charging stations in Canada.  I know there are none in my area, but did you find any along the way? Hopeful Canadian here.

 Customer: Hi; how much is your paint?

Clerk: Well sir, that depends on a lot of things.

Customer: Can you give me an approximate price?

Clerk: Our lowest price is our introductory special at $12 a gallon; after that we have dozens of different prices up to $199.

Customer: What is the difference in the quality of the paint?

Clerk: Oh, there is really no difference; its all exactly the same stuff.

Customer: Well, in that case Ill take your $12 paint.

Clerk: Well actually the $12 variety is only available to you on our website. If you want to buy it here at the store youll be charged an additional $20 Customer Convenience Fee.

Customer: So if I go home and get if off the website its only $12?

Clerk: That is correct, Sir--- plus a Credit Card Usage Fee of $6 and then of course there is the standard Shipping and Handling Fee of $14.

Customer: What?!! So, in other words, buying online would cost me exactly the same as what Id have to pay here in the store?

Clerk: I suppose so, but if you buy it here you get to use it immediately. Online purchases take ten business days to get to you, unless you pay the optional $24 Express My Paint fee.

Customer: You have got to be kidding me?!! Arent you?

Clerk: Well no, Sir; but that is academic anyway as right now the $12 paint is completely sold out in both places.

Customer: Thats BS! I am looking at shelves full or the stuff!

Clerk: Ah, but that does not mean that it is available for sale. We sell only a certain number of introductory priced cans on any given day. Oops, look at that! It just became available again at $17.50.

Customer: Cmon! You mean to say it went up while Im standing here?

Clerk: Fraid so. Inventory control changes our prices all the time. I strong urge you to purchase your paint as soon as possible as it could go up again. How many gallons do you want?

Customer: Well, maybe three gallons. No, make that four; I dont want to run out. I assume I can return
anything I dont open?

Clerk: Certainly, Sir. The $12 paint is non-refundable, but if you return it within 48 hours you will be entitled to a $4 credit towards the future purchase of another gallon of the same colour paint at the same or higher price.

Customer: That is crazy! In that case Ill just give any unopened can to my brother as hes planning to repaint his home soon.

Clerk: Sorry, Sir, no-can-do! Our terms and CAN-ditions- -- thats a little in-house paint joke--- prohibit paint transfer. It is strictly for the use of the original purchaser.

Customer: But wait a minute; I hadnt spotted those Paint Sale-$9.99* a Can signs over there. That sound like a much better deal.

Clerk: Ah yes, thats from our low cost paint division. That asterisk denoted that the cans are actually half
gallons and the price is based on a minimum purchase of two. There is also an additional Environmental Fee of $5 per can; a non-refundable Can Deposit of $3.50; a Paint Facility Charge of $5 and if you want more than one color, the second has a $25 surcharge and the third is $5 extra.

Customer: This is ridiculous; to hell with it. Ill buy what I need elsewhere.

Clerk: Well sir, you may be able to buy paint for some rooms from another store but you wont be able to find the paint for your connecting hall and stairway anywhere but here. And I should point out to you that if you want Uni-Directional paint it is priced at $249 a gallon.

Customer: I thought your most expensive paint was $199?

Clerk: Sir, that is only if you paint non-stop all the way around the room and back to the point at which you started. Stairways and hallways are considered unidirectional one way exceptions to the rule.

Customer: So, if I buy the $199 point and use it in my hallways and stairs what are you going to do about itsend some goons in to paint over it?

Clerk: Sir, I believe you are getting it now. But no, please, that would be plain silly. Wed simply charge you a Direction Adjustment Fee plus the difference to the $249 on your next purchase.

Customer: New Purchase?!! No way! I am out of here.

Clerk: We at Skyhigh Paints never forget that you have a choice, so thanks for shopping with us and have a nice day. Bye bye!

And aint that just exactly how it is these days?
 









 Is it bad that the funniest thing about this picture is your ears?
