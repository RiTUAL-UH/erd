 So, where do i start? Well, it's 11:06 P.M. My blind is half way closed, and I'm sitting in my chair reading nosleep non-stop. I've always wanted to wright a story that send's shivers down people's spines. I wanted to do that for the longest time, though I just keep finding myself stuck in this limbo. I know I have the writing skill, but god damn! I wish I could pull one off from right under your nose like the rest have. Those people could fool all of you with the press of a button. I honestly found it laughable when people think the authors stories seem real, but the cold hard fact is most of them aren't. It's just plain, and simple story telling talent. 

That's until you find a real one.

You know when people wright bullshit tales that end with them being possessed? How about when they commit suicide while, ironically enough, they can type it out on the computer. And even better, becoming insane only to somehow collect your thought's for an hour or two in order to tell your story. It's just complete fucking disregard for quality. When following the list above, your sure to achieve ruining the atmosphere the reader has let themselves build around them. I came across a total of six of these. Each filling to the brim with awkward writing, awful build up, and not enough stupidity to give me even a single chuckle. I was just fed up, covering my face, and let out a sigh. one last story. if it's another shit storm I'm heading to bed.

Well, I'm still up.

Have you ever read "Just one last time, I want to see your face." It was crudely written piece by the author, " \ | / " And yes, it's just three line's literally, and no words to the username. It was an out of the box looking username. Hell, an out of the box username may contain an out of the box tale. Unfortunately, to my surprise, It looked worse than the other one's. I cringed with the first few lines. It had so much more potential to fill the shit list criteria than to be a dreadful tale to keep me up. 

Well, I'm still up. Why? Just keep following along and you'll see.

It start's out with the title repeating three times. Then, break's into someone trying to act like a madman, typing at his computer. In my head, I checked the childishly insane typing at his computer off the good ol' criteria. In all honesty, you've probably noticed I'm a bit of whiner. And because of that tendency, I shrugged. Being a bit of a  brat, I had to point out to myself, aloud, how the material I was reading was indeed a heaping pile of bullshit.

I feel so stupid for that now.  

Soon, it started to not be so funny. From what I'm guessing, this had to be an individual whom was interested in a particular woman. This person was writing as if being chased at the same time. There were no comma's or periods; He just started typing away as if grammar and proper spelling didn't exist. Now, at first i thought this was just a mess wearing a bad make shift ghost costume. But, just then, this individual started to write clear as day. I had saved the story in order to simply copy and paste these line's here. Funny thing is, the story itself is gone. I wouldn't exactly recommend trying to look for this story. Been there, done that. And I did it all just to find that damned story again. You can guess the outcome. Though, i still remember the story. I'll try to be as accurate as possible. "I would couress her for the end of time's and kiss her soft angelic skin above her eye's. I would whisk her away for her beauty and would hush children's tongue's for her red wine." I wouldn't call it beautiful, but it was surely a lot more poetic. This user started to wright poetic rhymes that tickled the spine. I won't lie, i was a bit intrigued. I asked myself all kind's of questions, they spanned from who was this poet? Who was this woman they talked about, and why write it... like this? soon, this poem started to turn sour. He started to talk about perverting her to his will. I will NOT tell you what he wrote at this point. It wasn't shocking or even disgusting. What he wrote from then on was merely disturbing. It was so subtle you didn't notice it at first. But as you closed in on the distorting, intriguing words it all became clear. I didn't notice right then, but i was actually scared. Though, despite how hard i tried to just move on, I was hooked on every word. 

Now, I will show you this last bit of the poem. I know what your thinking, I'm going against what i said earlier. I promise, this is the last bit you'll need to know."Bashful, my love. I know you will be here. I will one day feel your cold breath against my cheek. The story will be full. And your love bleak. It's as dark as your hair and pale face. I will free you from your golden cage, together haven will we rest in our special place. Your skin touches that of the moon. Your complexity ensues. I will break your glass door. My shadow at your red door. You will be scared. It is okay my love. for I am prepared. I will lay with you and fill your vase. I will come soon. And you, my love, will sing a wonderful tune." 

This last bit terrified me to the core. I decided to, as you already know, save the story. I then turned my computer off and hopped into bed. I started thinking about this story whilst trying to sleep. It was a haunting story that filled my mind with unspeakable horror's. I just couldn't get to sleep. I then did something i shouldn't have; I made comparison's. The golden cage with dove's, my bedroom wallpaper. Dark hair and pale skin that touches the moon, my black hair and pale white skin. But these were just coincidences, right? I hopped out of bed to check outside my window. I was so scared, I just wanted at least to know that no one was there. I wanted to just have that little sliver of hope. But when I looked out, I saw a man standing there. He was looking into my bedroom window. It's 1:30 A.M. now, and he still hasn't left. 
  




 ya... 




 History facts... i like it and dig it :] 




 i am an awful person. Why? 

Cause i chuckled a bit...

I'm awful... 




 well everyone has there opinion's but i hope ya got a little something out of it. 
If so im glad :] 




 I'll get back to you on that one. I'm busy digging a hole right now :D

... For flowers... (ya, that'll fool em) 




 i know it's not the best but if it makes someone giggle a little im happy ;] 




 Bring a shotgun 
























 Wait... the smiling man is a Let's not meet post? My day just got a whole lot more sleepless... Fuck. 




 I actually just looked it up. I feel like an idiot... Thank you though. Criticism isn't something to take as an insult, but an opportunity to learn. :]        




 I will admit, I ain't really good at grammar and such. I tried my best but I'll keep working on my writing skill. I'm looking up the words you gave me. Either my teacher's never taught me that in school, or I forgot. I wasn't a good learner in school. But I'll work on it for sure. 




 Ya, I'm trying to get better with my grammar and such. Sorry about that. Though, I'm glad you found it interesting. Fun fact: Never have eaten a cake after that. NEVER AGAIN. 




 For the past five or so week's my throat has been having this itch. It started out simple enough. 
Ironically, it happened on my birthday. My mom, dad, little brother, big sister, and her two kids were there. 
The cake was very beautiful. Icing roses, and amazing artwork by my sister made with some gooey candy stuff that I can't quite remember the name of. 
A little card, kind of like the one you would get from a business place with contact info on it, seated itself atop the cake with the writing "Happy Birthday!" It was a good day. 
One of my nephews was whacking around a foam sword, unintentionally breaking three of the most expensive things in my house. 
I joked with my sister that we should keep a tally on how many things would be in pieces before the day would end. 
She laughed and turned to face me. 
Because of this, she didn't see my nephew coming full force with his foam sword. 
Splat, the cake was mushed to a pulp. My sister scolded her son for a second. 
She then took away the foam swords and apologized. 
I told her it was nothing. She gave me a look and fixed her eyes on the cake. "It's still good" I said. 
I then proceeded to convince her along with the rest of the family that this was the case. 
After all, it would be a bitch to fix up another one. And, I honestly didn't think I deserved that much treatment. That was the reason I convinced them it was fine; the cake was still good. 

When all was good and done, I said my good bye's to my family before they went home. 
I was in good spirits, I didn't even notice that little tickle in my throat. 
It wasn't until I was laying silent in bed, moon looming over me. Swallowing, I felt this strange tingle of pain. 
I got some water, and then the pain seemed to settle. over the course of two days, it got worse. 
It wasn't pain this time, it was a tickle. After the third day, I just couldn't concentrate on anything. 
Because of this, I decided to see a Doctor. I thought of a bunch of thing's this tickle could possibly be. 
A sexual disease, flu, my smoking catching up with me, and loads more. 
If your curios about the first one, I just started dating this wonderful girl. You never know. Let's move on. 
The Doctor thought nothing of it when i told him how it felt. He "diagnosed" that I had a sore throat, or an allergy. I took what he had said as the truth. No reason to worry, right? 
It wasn't really hurting at this point, so I couldn't say other wise. 
Well, unfortunately, it turned back into a sore throat a day later. 
I decided to call in sick, my throat bothered me enough to do so. 
With enough sleep and a healthy dose of water, I would get over this I thought. 
I had no idea how bad things would escalate.

That same god damn tickle turned into an itch. Sooner or later I started to scratch the outside of my neck. 
Then, inside my throat as well. It wasn't like before where I would swallow constantly to stop the pain. 
This time I used my nail's to sooth the pain in my throat. My neck for some weird reason became more of a problem as time went on as well. I started scratching a lot there too. Without even thinking, I started to scratch. 
When the pain would engulf my throat and neck, I would scratch. 
Later on, If I wasn't scratching, I could feel the pain. Over a short period of time this itch got out of hand. 
The pain kept getting severe, and more so as time went on. I kept scratching. 
From then on, the blind's remained closed since the light from outside started to hurt my eyes. 
With the blinds closed, it hurt less to see. Funny enough though, with the blinds closed I could barely see. 
I was okay with it though. I always preferred the dark anyway.  

After awhile, I started getting call's from work after four days of being absent; I stopped answering them. 
After three week's of this itch, I was kinda loopy. I knew this wasn't normal, something was going on. 
The problem with knowing something's wrong is when you don't quite know what that problem is. 
A day literally felt like a week. 
In the back of my mind, I even started to think that a ghost or a demon was behind this. 
I never thought that was the issue, though it was hard trying to keep it out of mind. Soon, it got hard to talk. 
At one point, I almost felt as if i couldn't say a word without pain rushing behind my sentences. 
My throat was completely void of any moisture. 
Truthfully, I didn't think it was as bad as it was, despite knowing this was not your normal sore throat. 
In my head, my logical calm self was in charge. 
It said "Mike, you should really see a doctor soon and get back to your boss about this." 
I was worried, but not as much as I should have been.

After some debate in my head, I decided to call the doctor to schedule another appointment. 
My head started to feel clouded, and I couldn't think straight without mustering enough mentality to do so. 
My hand reached for my cell, it was charging in front of the alarm clock. God, when was the last time I used it? 
I stopped as my hand touched the phone. Something looked off. 
I didn't notice it at first, and I cannot comprehend how I didn't notice sooner. 
How often I was scratching, all I did was sleep, thought's seeming cloudy, thinking it was just the same pain I had in my throat from the very start. I had blood on my fingers. 
I tried to yell out "Jesus Christ!", but it was so painful I couldn't bear one letter. 
If the light from the alarm clock didn't alert me when I went to grab my phone, I don't know how much longer that stained hand would have gone unnoticed. 
Despite the major headache that ensued from getting up too quickly, I opened the blinds. 
The Light felt like a literal stab in the eyes. I didn't let that stop me from turning around to check my bed. 
I couldn't tell that there was a nice big blotch of blood on my bed, my vision was way to impaired too. 
I just stood there until I could see exactly what I suspected to see. 
The only thing that scared me is it was a little bigger than I first thought. 
I looked down afterwards to see a puddle forming in front of me. 
I shoved my fingers down my throat to where I had been scratching. There was an indent. I felt my neck. There was a slight, shallow indent. And from what I could see, a whole lot of blood. Things started to blur. 

I was absolutely terrified.

I started to black out, so I tried to reach for my phone to call 911. 
I tripped, and landed with my face leaning against the bed. 
I tried my best to get up, yet due to my blood loss I kept fumbling over and over again. 
I really thought I was going to die right there. 
Although, my will power, or instinct, whatever you call it, came over me and I forced myself up. 
My vision was literally coming in and out as I stumbled over my bed. It felt kinda like slow motion. 
That's the best way I could describe it. 
Sounds a little dramatic, but I wasn't scared anymore; I was trying to survive. 
I finally got to my phone and then attempted to dial 911. 
I don't remember if I got it wrong once or twice, just that I wanted to cry when I messed up. 

Finally, the ring. *ring* *ring* *ri-* "Hello, this is 911, what's your emergency?" 

I felt so woozy as I tried to speak. When I finally did mange to focus enough to speak, I couldn't. 
My throat, my fucking throat hurt so immensely that I couldn't even say a word. I was dying, I could feel it. 
Once again, I was scared. I then screamed in my mind "Your gonna die, so just yell. Yell as hard as you can." 
I slammed the phone on the counter, Then I yelled at the top of my lungs. 
It was the worst pain I have ever experienced in my life. After that last desperate call for help, nothing, black.

I woke up in a hospital bed, light hurting my eyes. My family wasn't there yet. 
I looked around until I saw a doctor walking towards me, he wanted to make sure I was looking fine and stable. 
He then explained everything that happened to me. how lucky I was to be alive, my family should be here soon, the condition I was is, and the surgical process they went through. 

You want to hear the funny part of this story? 

During surgery, they removed a certain something from my throat. 

It was a small, cardboard like paper. You know the one's they give to you at business places with their contact info and all that? It was like that. There was also something written on it.

"HAPPY BIRTHDAY!"
 




 Honestly, I haven't seen him in a few days. I'll keep you posted. 




 Honestly... I agree with this. Damn, guess i gotta start being a bit more nice... 




 My apologies. As you read, I wrote this late at night. I was really tired and posted this once I thought I proof read it as much as I needed too. Oh dear god was I wrong. I'm in the middle of editing it now, so soon it can be legible. Thank you for being honest. criticism isn't something to take as an insult, but as a lesson to be learned. Thank you, friend. :]   
























 Grammy wasn't dead just yet. Grammy was just curious to see what her own granddaughter would do once she died. As you can see in the photo she was quite shocked. Grammy wished she knocked some goddamn sense into her granddaughter. #duckface   




 The music being played in the video doesn't quite set the mood... But hell, just an opinion. 




 I kinda feel bad by saying this but... should have pinched yourself before doing that bro... I'm sorry for you bro... really, really sorry. :[ 




 This right here... This right here was a good read. A read iv'e been waiting for. thank you :] 




 "Hello, Doctor?" "Yes?" "I'd like to quit my therapy." "Oh really? I thought we were making good progress?" "Well the thing is I found a guy..." 




 A little here, a little there. Make sure you tell someone before it ends up everywhere. 




 Goddammit [faceplam]
                     




 That end line... Did not see that one coming.

Damn. 
























 I have no idea how this would work, but I wish we had pedo detectors that would alarm sayings such as "Stranger danger" or "Beat it, I'm ten ya man cougar!" (In rare cases super cougar.) 
 




 Jeez, that is really creepy. Working around drunk people who pass by all the time gives me the impression you have enough story ammunition for a 12 hour party (get together, etc.) . But I'm glad your safe and that it all seemed to work out in the end... Just hope he doesn't come back.  




 Don't worry, I believe that you will believe for I believe in you.  




 This made me cry. I love you humanity... And those big bottomed girls make the world go round, Right Freddie?  




 It's like Facebook is that awkward guy at a party trying to make everyone laugh with jokes that go too far. No one is laughing. 




 Just gonna leave this here

 Tree says: "Don't you or your dog even fucking dare!" 




 It could be a murderous, rampaging, insane, psycho monster, but it's still cute as fuck.   
























 You know what makes me feel better? Not this. Maybe I can imagine it as a sleepover, but fuck it is hard too.  




 Cozy? 




 I don't know whats cooler, this story, or the fact that death has a Reddit account. 




 This is special.  




 Thank you so much! :] 




 Can you feel it? Your thoughts draining from you. There is a slit in your head and everything is starting to leak out and float away. You start to feel all that imagination and those genius ideas of yours become harder to pin point in your head. You just start zoning out instead of thinking about the most interesting things. Actions that were never executed due to the lack of the ideas and thoughts that your imagination spawned in that little head of yours. I cuss and swear but it's all pointless in the end. I go through life everyday losing more and more of what I had. I'm defeated.

I even start to notice that I don't look with my eye's anymore. I don't really see, it's more of a daily grind of usual events that never seem to change guiding me to where I'm supposed to go. It's as if someone is grabbing my hand and pulling me where to go next while I just stare blankly into the ground. I'm lifeless, and my thoughts are leaking. Who I am is leaving me, but somehow I'm still here. My consciousness is rolled up into a fetal position inside my head as it's stripped of everything. I am merely a viewer now, but I just want to leave you with one last thought before I depart.

Who's pulling the strings when we become thoughtless, what guides us, and who or what happened to my head. I mean, you don't just start losing your thoughts by yourself, do you? Is it that I need something to blame all this on or is it just me? I don't know if I should feel scared, angry, or just plain concerned. Something Inside is telling me to just loosen my grip and submit. Something wants me to let go, and you know I could just let go, but I won't.

How could I let go of all this, my thoughts, feelings, memories. As I slowly lose my grip and fade to black, I see that little bit that I have left. I don't want to leave all that behind, because that made me happy when I felt bleak. Just giving up to this dark void? Fuck that. No. I refuse.

I will fight till I die inside. Sure, you can scoop everything I love and hold dear out of my head and just leave me to become a husk, but I am for damn sure not letting you do that easily. I will fight you, whatever you are, and grip as tight as I can to all those amazing child hood dreams and memories that made me smile and laugh. Fuck letting all of that just fade away and fuck you. You will win and I will lose in the end. But, I will love, I will smile, I will look back on those times I had done both, and I will remember. I will remember what it was like to live.

I will live until I die, and I will remember as much as I can before I float away. 




 It's good to know that things are good :]
