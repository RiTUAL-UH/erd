 **W**ednesday **H**as **U**nlimited **H**ints

We will find out all we need to know on Wednesday. Confirmed. 




 You did it. You uncovered it. Congratulations, my friend.

WHAT'S THE HIDDEN CODE!?!?!?

**EDIT 1:** Darby said "whuh". What does it mean!?

**EDIT 2:** Darby McDevitt is the creative scriptwriter at Ubisoft. He was the lead writer of ACIV. He will most definitely know about ACV.

**EDIT 3:** People...I know it means what/huh. Please just relax and have fun...and decipher the code... 




 Okay. Okay. I've got it...

**UBISOFT IS SPEAKING THROUGH DREAMS NOW!!!** 




 In fact, I went to my local Best Buy today and asked if they had a shipment of ACV posters come in. I was told that they haven't arrived *yet*. YET! 

That being said, I don't think posters are going up tomorrow.  




 The letters are not highlighted anymore. Did a mod just troll us hardcore? 




 FRENCH!? ARE YOU HINTING AT SOMETHING!?!? 




 "I don't know if it worked the first time. Will you baptize me again?" 




 Is this even possible now? 




 Thank you both. I'm over-hyping myself. Sorry. 




 What. Is. Happening.

Has the spoiler box always hidden the words "Something is coming"? I don't think so... 




 **UPDATE:** I went to Best Buy and asked if they had received a shipment of Assassin's Creed V posters. This is what I was told:

"We don't have them in *yet*..."

Yet. What does yet mean, guys? Yet. Is there a shipment on the way? Yet. Do they have a date that they wouldn't share? Yet. Is it just some ambiguous in the future kind of yet? Or is it a specific kind of 'we know the date' yet? YET!!!! 




 Absolutely. I've bought hamburgers for $10. An 8 hour + game is worth the money. 




 I'm stopping by Best Buy tonight to see if I can bribe an employee for any information. If they don't have promotional posters, they are getting them soon. Wish me luck. 




 Seriously. Give me anything. Assassin's in Space. I really don't care. I just need something to soothe my stress. 




 Hi, my name is /u/test_subject861, and I'm an AC addict...

This is a safe place to share your addictive habits concerning Assassin's Creed. Go ahead. We are here for you. 




 It has long been confirmed that Ubisoft is making a yearly main cannon release for Assassin's Creed. We are, in fact, expecting two AC-related releases this year, my friend. 




 I don't care as much about the poster as I do about the trailer.  

ACIII was unveiled with a cinematic trailer on March 5th.

ACIV was unveiled with a cinematic trailer on March 4th.  

So, do we possibly see ACV's trailer on Monday? Here's to hoping. 




 Hmm...

If this is the case, we might have all been right in connecting the boxes between Embers and Freedom. If this is the case, the clues really have been in front of our face the entire time. But something in me is saying "no". 

Nonetheless, this is really the most evidence we have for any particular game. China. 




 All of these are great finds. I've read many of them. However, I have heard that there has been confirmation that we will not return to Shau Jun's story. Can anyone corroborate that with an official link? 




 Great find! I'm going to include this in my post above so we can keep them all together.
 




 We do know that sometime this year there will be a major installment. All of the others have progressed 1-4. I think it is safe to assume that one of the releases this year will be V. 




 I too like where this is going. I don't have much to add right now, but maybe we should start looking in this direction.

The only thing I want to stress if that the clue(s) are "right in our faces", we just don't know it...
 




 It is crazy to believe that they can keep it this tightly sealed. There have got to be some assassin-like people in the organization that are willing to lose their job and then go into hiding for a leak! 

But, I agree with you.

The absolute least we have to go on is that there are hints in both Black Flag and Freedom Cry. Why can't we at least decipher those? 




 I guess I'll start and just edit in additional ones I find here.

[**(2.23.14) Jade Raymond**] (http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/meet-woman-behind-assassin-s-creed-155897) - Her favorite era and not samurai age Japan.

[**(1.28.14) Darby McDevitt**](http://www.edge-online.com/features/black-flags-red-herrings-assassins-creed-writer-darby-mcdevitt-on-whats-next-for-ubisofts-flagship-series/) *from /u/Khal_Drogo_Baggins* - Ubisoft builds games (decides locations) based on technology. The technology to climb and walk around on dynamically moving objects will return. In-game email location hints were just for fun. 

[**(12.09.13) Wesley Pincombe**](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-12-09-assassins-creed-4-dlc-new-locations-and-ac5-hints) - Freedom Cry contains hints that are "in your face" but will take "hardcore fans" to understand them.

[**(11.05.13) Gabe Graziani** ] (http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pz0j2/iama_developer_on_assassins_creed_iv_black_flag/cd7ip5r) *from /u/Khal_Drogo_Baggins* - It sounds like they don't have any plans to continue Shao Jun's story back in China. 




 Post links below. With all of our powers combined, can't we decipher hints as to where AC5 will take place?

There have been leaks or hidden clues for almost every other AC game. Why haven't we figured this one out? 




 I am answering 




 PLOT TWIST: The protagonist is actually Lucy Stillman from the previous games. SHE ISN'T DEAD!!! 




 For upgrades, you must invent new things. New to kill someone slowly? Invent fire. Need to set a trap that will crush someone? Invent the wheel. 

I can imagine two hidden clubs strapped to both arms. I like where this is going. 




 Yes. More of this please. 




 Let's just say I work at Best Buy... 




 Everyone has their opinions on the era/setting of the next Assassin's Creed. Here are mine and the reasons why:

* **Assassin.s Creed Transylvania** - There are, like, no video games set in spooky mansions with blood suckers all about. Assassins already wear capes - check. They are in search of blood (for animus stuff) - check. PLUS, final target - Dracula himself. Okay. Done. Give me money and I'll sign over rights Ubisoft. 

* **Assassin;s Creed World War 3** - Take out Hitler. Easy. How you ask? Shoot him. Use a gun, the staple weapon of the whole AC series. Bring in a tank. I don't care. Kill the guy and save the Jews!

* **Assassins Creed Over the Boarder** - Now listen to me and listen well. Every year there are tens of billions of Mexicans trying to cross over the U.S.of A. boarder to steal our jobs. Imagine an assassin that runs along the line stabbing illegal immigrants right in the throat. Nothing screams AMERICA like this game would!

* **Assassin-s Creed Baywatch** - Try and tell me this wouldn't be the perfect setting. I dare you! Tons of assassination opportunities from the sand, in the water, and under the docks. You're really going to try and make me believe that thousands of people die because of stupid SHARKS throughout the year? Give me a break. Two of 'em idiots.

AND, last but not least...

* **Assassin^s Creed Reign of Terror** - Uh, hello. FRENCH REVOLUTION ANYBODY!? No one has thought of this one yet? Are you kidding me! I know this will be it. I saw an email Easter Egg in ACIV (hint hint). Guillotines, Robs Pierre, and Marie Antwofreakinette!!!! And who wouldn't love hearing fake French accents for 20+ hours!?!?

Just a few ideas floating around in my head. If you want some more just ask. 




 I definitely see the Hundred Years' War being a great possibility. Rich with history and events, and an extended timeline to traverse through (which they seem to like doing with one assassin character).

I never was trying to rule anything in or out. I simply wanted to make some widespread observations and see if they come to pass.  




 I did mention this under the **Egypt** heading. But this is a video game that is talking about a First Civilization, a world catastrophe, and magical items spread throughout the world, I think they can create earlier assassins if they so desire. 




 Thought I'd prepare a slightly different post sharing where I think Ubisoft will take future Assassin's Creed games. Most are concerned where V will be and could care less about VI or VII or how it will conclude with X. I clearly have no idea where they will go or end up, but here are some basic thoughts (in no particular order):

* **Medieval / King Arthur's Court**. I personally think this might be V. It has been mentioned in passing, but no one has seemed to carry this idea forward. I feel like it would be cool to have to eliminate the court members one by one, as obviously they were Templar scum. We haven't had straight up castles, moats, knights, and damsels in distress. I believe this is coming at some point.

* **French Revolution**. Whether you love or hate the idea, it's going to happen at some point. It's too good and too unexplored to pass up. I personally think it'll be a side game rather than a main title because I think it would have to include Connor to some degree. It might just mention or cameo him, but I think the time periods and characters are too close. The revolution, as far as I know, has not been touched in other games and would be a beautiful setting with an enthralling story for some future game.

* **First Civilization**. Haven't heard this discussed much, but I think it will a game at some point. When I first saw "Great Fall", I felt that this might be concerning origins. However, that "leaked" graphic might be fake. Regardless, I believe that at some point we will be in control of Adam and/or Eve. 

* **Oriental / East Asian**. I think it is one of the more distant games, but it would be difficult to skip over these beautiful and unique settings. I know they have touched it some in extended content, but they will take us there in a future game. I feel that it will be early-modern Japan with samurai, but that is just a fun guess.

* **Egypt**. I saw fellow redditor suggest an early assassin that uses primitive weapons such as scorpions, snake poison, etc. The only problem I have with this is that the "realistic" order of Assassins were formed later in time. I'm not sure if Ubisoft cares about this, but it is worth mentioning.

I think that these are some locations that we will see, some sooner and some later, some in main games and some in side games. Here are a few game-changing systems I think will be added and explored at some point:

* **Character customization/upgrades**. This has been dealt with by other people and I think if they want it to fit into the realm of possibilities within the Animus, then they will make it do so.

*  **Player options**. At some point, we will be able to have a choice which assassin story to follow. In fact, I think it will be soon where we can play through a game as the primary protagonist (Assassin) or antagonist (Templar). The story will play out the same, but we will see both sides of the story, as they are already trying to get us to see in recent releases.

* **Single Assassin Missions**. This might get some negative feedback because it doesn't make sense in the current scheme of AC games. But, I think that at some point we will be able to jump into various stories throughout history and play through the assassination or assassination attempt. I don't see full games in more modern history, but I see single events where we can get a taste of those assassinations. For example: Abraham Lincoln, Franz Ferdinand, Adolf Hitler, etc. This will surely be side games or DLC/extended content. 

So, here are some of my thoughts for the metanarrative of the Assassin's Creed franchise. What do you agree with? What do you disagree with? What sounds fun? What sounds terrible? Care to add anything? Thanks for taking the time to read. 




 No. I just know that if you are willing to work hard, there are jobs available. In fact, there are infinite jobs. You think I'm crazy, I know. 

Write a book, start a business, learn a new trade, study design, go back to school. Do whatever it takes, but there are limitless possibilities for the one willing to sacrifice and do the work necessary to attain what they desire. 




 I agree with you in regards to the advantages we have been given. I also understand that there are many people without the advantages I have been granted, although they most definitely have some other advantages that I am not privy to.

I love Jesus. He was a great man as far as I can tell. He most definitely did advocate for charity and helping those around you, as I agree wholeheartedly with. I don't know where I would have given off the opposite impression. I also am not sure how that applies to the conversation at hand.

I do feel as though we might have gone into a deeply philosophical dialogue that I didn't intend for this post to go.

Once again, my main comment stands: Share your opinion. Vote. By all means. But if you don't like the way the Creator is running things, go play/do something else.  




 Absolutely not. But my point is neither for nor against anarchy or democracy for that matter. It is that the Creator makes the rules and we follow or don't. Enjoy the game the way it is being played or go play another game. 




 Respond whatever way you see fit. I could care less. My point is that the purpose of the project has not been ruined by the Creator's choices.  




 I reread my original post. Nowhere did I say that one couldn't give their opinions. Opinions are great things. Opinions are also monumentally different than attempts to overthrow the system and/or force the Creator's/boss's hand.

The Creator opened a vote. Voting is great. You are kind of making my point stronger (thanks). If people vote democracy, democracy rules. If people vote anarchy, anarchy rules. But the experiment doesn't fail with or without it. That is my point.

P.S. I live in a world where people whine and complain and do nothing to better their work situation. There are thousands of jobs available in the real world my friend. They are available for the hard worker, for the educated, for the faithful, for the ethical, and for those willing to go out and find a job rather than sit at home on their computer and complain that there aren't any jobs available. 




 Listen, how about we let the Creator do whatever he wants. If you don't like it or agree with it, stop playing along. If you do like, have fun and enjoy the process.

This kind of "educated whining" reminds me of fast food restaurant workers complaining about how much they are getting paid and so their solution is to go on strike. 

Are you kidding me? If you don't like how much you are getting paid, go get another freaking job. There are many people that would work for how much you are getting paid. And there are thousands of jobs available for you out in the world. Get off your lazy butt and go find one. 

Entitlement is a nasty monster. I truly hope that the Creator doesn't care what we think. It was his (brilliant) idea to begin the journey. He can affect it in whatever way he deems necessary. Everyone else can either play along, or politely GTFO. 














 Jake! Amir!

My wife and I (Dustin and Cara) are coming to NYC just to eat a quick lunch (or long dinner) with you sometime between Dec 26th   Jan 1st. 

PLEASE, take a few minutes out of your day to get a FREE meal from us. Yeah, you heard that right - FREE. It will be worth it. I know you guys can't do this for everyone. But you surely can do it for us. 

Do for one what you can't do for all! 
























 I am in desperate need of some casual (cost-efficient) socks of varying colors. Suggestions of where to find them online for a quick purchase? And am I looking for design? No design? And what colors? 




 [Winter to Spring Transition](http://i.imgur.com/gIFkcWR.jpg)

Don't know if it is too late to post my outfit. And noticed that it is dark so it is difficult to see color/detail. This is my first outfit post. Please help with suggestions/comments! 




 We went through this about a month ago. Fake as fake can be, my friend. 




 Tack, you are 39 on the leader board of Win % for players playing over 1,000 games. You are beyond great.  




 I think this is about as accurate as one could get. 




 Obviously, this is a subjective question. A lot of it depends on degree and many other factors. And there will surely be jokes of "100% winz lol!!1!" 


Nonetheless, at what number would you say someone has a **great** Win %?  




 A drive-thru liquor store. 

I guess it still helps waste your night away, just with a different product.  




 Yeah, I should have addressed that. I know that we are supposed to have separate shoes for each, but I want to be the exception (duh)! 

I won't do heavy athletics in them. I would simply wear them while at the gym doing light lifting/running. Likewise, I wouldn't wear them casually much at all, just when I need a dark shoe to compliment a particular outfit. 




 Here are the qualities I am looking for in the shoe:

* I don't want to spend more than $75.
* They need to be a dark color (preferably black).  
* Must have decent/good support.
* Must strike a perfect balance, allowing me to wear them to the gym for light running/weight lifting AND out on the town with a casual day-to-day outfit. 

Ideas? I've found these so far:

[**Adidas Original Dragons**](http://www.amazon.com/adidas-Originals-Dragon-Retro-Sneaker/dp/B004JXWUES/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top)

[**Puma ZDC82**](http://www.amazon.com/ZDC82-Peacoat-Black-Heritage-Trainers-UK/dp/B00DEENV5K/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1394861709 sr=8-2 keywords=puma+zdc) 









 Dude, you look great! 

Awesome job maintaining your fashion in spite of your disabilities! You are one that we can all look up to. None of us have a good enough excuse to just "not care." Thanks for the inspiration!  




 I am still not sure if we can take these tweets as confirmation that ACV is underway. Don't get me wrong, I do believe that ACV is well underway (if not nearing  completion), but these tweets say absolutely nothing about ACV.

Ashraf Ismail was the game director for ACIV. I highly doubt that he will be the head game director for ACV as well. Although I might be wrong. 




 Noted. Will stray away from that practice. Thanks for the input everyone. 




 BTW, I didn't just make up blazer sleeve rolling:

[**Example 1**](http://static.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/blazerknit.jpg)

**[Example 2](http://images.asos.com/inv/Y/15/254/884667/Blue/image1xl.jpg)**

**[Example 3](http://i509.photobucket.com/albums/s332/CurtJWild/NavyBlazerChinos00003f.jpg)** 




 TL;DR - It'd look good if I changed the outfit? 




 Well, my sleeves are rolled because, obviously, I (mistakenly) thought it looked good. And because it's warmer here.  




 Fairly simple question. It'd normally go under Outfit Feedback, but those don't occur on Wednesday.

I am conflicted on whether or not this works as a good navy blazer. Thoughts?

Top - http://i.imgur.com/1p8mc3j.jpg
Bottom - http://i.imgur.com/1SJinyG.jpg

Any other general comments concerning the outfit as a whole would be beneficial as well. Thank you for your help! 




 You make great points. And I think the majority of the discussion regarding other people's finances all has to do with percentages. I do understand that some people can buy a mansion like I can buy a Big Mac. I do understand that. 

But just because it is difficult to tell when night ends and day begins doesn't mean that we can't know it's midnight.

I think there is an amount of balance and wisdom in the equation. I am not to judge. And I don't really want to. It was just a personal observation and I am fully aware that I might be wrong.

*P.S. Love having the insightful conversation with you /u/BAMF_3.*  




 See, I think that is the very and only response that can be made. We all make judgments based off of what we see. A nice person won't make constant decisions to do mean things. Just as a selfless person wouldn't make regular decisions to be selfish. 

Actions help us determine character.  




 Great article! This is where I am at:

While the two shirts are uniquely different and, to be fair,  the two MFA uses are uniquely different, I do not see $450 worth of value ever making sense to just "get *exactly* what one wants. I think that is a prideful and abundantly selfish thing. Sure, you could argue that clothing and fashion is a selfish pursuit to begin with. But I think this is excessive 99% of the time.  




 Absolutely. Coming your way. 




 Hello friendly mods. I was told that this is where I post to join the Assassin ranks. I currently have 565 comment karma (yes, most of my karma is from our subreddit). Can I be a Milite!? 




 I feel like everyone on this thread just gathered together for a big group hug...and I'm not going to lie, it felt good.  




 Calm as a butterfly licking nectar from a common dandelion, my fiery friend.  




 *As did I. We will show him.* 




 Remember when you told me to go f*** off and die in another thread? Do you remember who you are mean to and who you are nice to? Or did you forget? 




 By the way, someone literally went through this entire post and downvoted everyone's comment. Who does that? 




 I think so too. I saw someone else say it and I have to agree, I am going to keep my hopes up until the 17th. If nothing has been revealed by then, I'll settle back down until E3 (still holding on to some hope it will be at a conference before then). 




 Make sure we are reporting the facts correctly. I don't think it is Ubisoft that has two big announcements tomorrow, I believe it is IGN per [this tweet](https://twitter.com/IGN/status/442407804939550720). 




 Newly released video footage of Evan Ebel in a 100 mph chase and shootout with Texas authorities on March 21, 2013. 

Things get real at the 6:00 minute mark, although the entire thing is full of tension. 









 The Genesis account is clear that representatives of all the *kinds* of land and air animals were brought to the ark ([Genesis 6:19-20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen+6%3A19-20 version=NIV)). This, for example, does not mean that there were two tigers and two lions, but that there were two feline kinds. 

If this true, the animals that survived the Flood would have had the genetic makeup to repopulate and create the current species that we have all around the world.

Animals do not have soul, but that does not mean that they are out of God's control. He is, after all, the Divine Creator. He has complete authority over all of creation, including animals. So yes, they are obeying God.

Scripture isn't clear on a localized flood although I think this is most fitting. The Flood would have covered the *known* world at the time, as the human author would have surely meant with his limited knowledge.

**TLDR:** If God is truly a miraculous God of which the Bible purports, He could surely do the miraculous to bring about a chain of events that preserve animals through and after the Flood. 




 That was significantly more mean than the first. 




 That was mean. 




 Don't know who deleted this but find it just silly since that is what all of today has been in this subreddit--an attempt to come up with believable rumors. 

Oh well, Darby liked it... 




 Do you know how to use correct punctuation? 

Anyways...your comments are what's making this worth it! 




 It's called time travel. Are you really that dense? 




 Nah. Actually, that is the pic I was in. Someone must have photoshopped me out. Weird.

I just met Darby at a creative writing conference. I had no clue that he would even be there. I freaked out when I saw him. We joked about recent Reddit hype. We talked about the future of Assassin's Creed. He let me in on some stuff. Just let me say, we will all be happy by the end of the week. 




 I live in the Line Islands, which just happen to be the earliest time zone in the world (UTC+14:00). We are literally at the exact same time as Hawaii, but a day ahead. Anyways...

Our island's Best Buy just released the artwork and cinematic trailer here. I don't want to ruin it for you guys. Let's just say...there's a new assassin!!! 




 Guys, honestly. I was on a cruise ship the other day and we were raided by pirates. No kidding. They swung on board screaming, "WE WANT YOUR BOOTY!" I freaked out. I had no clue what to do. So I did the only logical thing I could think of...

So when I abandoned ship and dove into the water I took a diving bell to get deep and far away from the booty snatchin' pirates. You're not going to believe what happened next...

After I punched the shark in the eye it swam away. I found another barrel, refreshed my oxygen supply, and continued to dive. Guess what happened...

I opened the treasure box that I found at the bottom of the ocean. I didn't even have to fumble with the latch, I just hit the box and it sprung open. Inside...Inside guys...there's no guessing this one so I'll just tell you...

A rolled up parchment. It read: *ACVREVEAL3414*

I have no clue what it means, just thought I should share. 




 Ender's Game is a fantastic book. It shows the brilliant potential of children and takes you into the mind of a genius. The cast of characters are dynamic and compelling. The story is riveting and well-rounded, easily accessible for many ages, backgrounds, and enjoyments. 

If you decide to continue the series, stay with the Ender's Saga (Speaker for the Dead) if you enjoy the intellectual/philosophical nature of Ender's Game. Move to the Bean Saga (Ender's Shadow) if you enjoyed the action sequences the most in Ender's Game. 




 They've commented numerous times that there will be an annual canonical release. [Here](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-director-defends-yearly-releases/1100-6391787/) you go.
 




 No one needs to relax. This is all part of the fun. We love Assassin's Creed. We love conspiracies. And we love hype. So...

Hop on the hype train. It's a lot of fun. 
























 I just woke up and remembered I wrote this late last night. At the time, I thought it was a good idea. What was I thinking? 

That being said, I've got part two to work on...  




 ###**The Battle for Bombing Run**
***
Captain Crimson wiped the dried spittle from his mouth with the back of his dirty hand. A cardinal chirped in the distance. The melodic song rang out sharply against the bleak backdrop of the battle at hand.  
  
Crimson and his team of three had been immersed into a serious battle for the past eleven hours. He knew that the final hour would determine the fate of his crew. Sergeant Jasper was Crimson's right-hand man. Jasper was a faithful patriot; one that had worked hard to achieve his position. Though, he had willingly trampled over many to get to where he was. There was also Poppy, an older man whom everyone respected and revered. No one knew his birth name. Due to his age and fatherly appeal, others started calling him Poppy. It picked up quickly. Esbe Juan was the final member of the bunch. His motives rarely clear and his actions always unexpected, Esbe held the lowest rank of the bunch; Private First Class. The cadre of four had been through a lot together. This was just another page in the expanding catalog of lessons learned.

"We're marooned!" yelled Esbe. "Absolutely stranded! There's nothing we can do to win this battle. We've got to lay down our arms; live to fight another day."

"There will not be another day, Private!" Poppy barked. "*This* is our day to win. I'd rather die than forfeit." 

Jasper didn't speak. He was deep in thought, pensive, looking out over the battlefield. He couldn't see clearly through the spike sector, but knew that on the other side stood a team of four re-positioning for the final attack.

"Here's the plan," said Captain Crimson. The others gathered around. "Poppy, as always, I want you to provide an impenetrable wall. Do not let anyone through, you understand me?" The old man nodded his head as he unwittingly tugged at his wispy white beard. 

"Esbe," the Captain continued, "you stay with Poppy. Do whatever he says the moment he speaks. Protect our...Esbe...Esbe!" 

Esbe apologized as he returned to the circle. As the Captain was speaking, Esbe had wandered off to the side to admire a rock.

"I've got it," Esbe confirmed. "I'm following you to the enemy's base."

Jasper hit Esbe in the back of the head. The Captain shook his head in disgust, but maintained his cool composure. "No Esbe. Just no. Do the opposite of what you just said and you'll be on the right track." 

Captain Crimson looked out over the horizon. "There are only two ways to get to the prize. Jasper, you take the south path. I'll take north. I would advise against pursuing the ammunition in the middle of the spike sector. I think it's a trap. There might be mines or bombs hidden in the ground. It's just not worth it."

Jasper blinked his agreement. "I'll go south, trying my best to take a speed pad for a quicker arrival. We reconvene on the other side?"

"Yes, Sergeant," Crimson said. "If we attack from opposite directions at varying speeds, I think we will throw them off, providing us with a small window to grab the prize and return home." 

They all knew what the prize was. The enemy's glorious flag was the treasure that would end this battle in their favor. The score was two all. This final hour would consume the lives of one team, leaving the other as victors.

Captain Crimson looked at his ragtag group of soldiers. They'd do just fine, he hoped. 

"It's time," he said, looking one last time at the ominous battlefield in front of him.

"Roll out!"

*To be continued.*
*** 




 Theologians differ on this point. The Bible doesn't speak to the subject specifically. However, Genesis 6:3 might be referencing the reversal of long life by God saying, "My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years."

When man and woman were originally created, they were done so perfectly. No sin equals no sickness. The punishment of sin was death, but it came slowly and gradually sped up as new generations came. 

The expansion of sin in our world today gives us less and less years to live. That is why it is important to realize that *now* is the day of salvation (2 Cor. 6:2). 




 Woet just kept coming into my test map games, using up the speed pads, blowing the bombs, taking the flag, and scoring. Woet... 




 I imagine that halfway through the game the other team just stopped and sat in base. "It's not worth it guys. Let's just let him have his fun. It'll all be over soon." 




 Also, there is a guy on the other team named **Butt Blood**. So...there's that. 




 This. 




 I'm not sure this is a good thing.  




 Also, if you are NOT going to pull a punch, that means you ARE going to hit hard. Pulling a punch means that you will be reserved.

Pack a punch means you are going to hit hard. If you are NOT going to hit hard, then...why the throwaway? I so confused... 




 We need movies that aren't "Christian movies", but that are made by Christians. I am sick and tired of believers thinking that there are such genres as Christian music, Christian television, or Christian movies. It appears that it is mainly in the art world. I think we've got it wrong.

A Christian message isn't always the gospel step by step. *The* Christian message is redemption, and that can be shared a number of ways. It doesn't have to be a song quoting John 3:16. It can be a song about hope, joy, and love, and accomplish more. Same goes for a movie. We are doing more damage making and supporting movies like God's Not Dead. Wake up Church. 




 So...if you were going to "pack punches" you would have used your primary account?  




 I like this. Not that I'm trying to get to the top of the leaderboard or anything....

EDT...EST...STD...whatever. 




 I'm playing a free online competitive game called **TagPro**. 

I know it's been mentioned before, but it is a great game. It is still a new game; in its birthing stages. It is simple in style and gameplay. Think capture the flag, but as rolling balls with spikes and bombs. If you aren't playing yet, or haven't even given it a try, do a quick Google search for TagPro and play a game or two. See how addicting it becomes.

Mine was a few seconds longer, but I managed to capture twice. 




 Wow. Great stuff. Saved to view after work. 

Check out this in-depth guide by /u/nivarius for strategy and map specifics! 




 The guillotine. Do you people understand? Do you even freakin' understand?  




 ^Legal ^Disclaimer: ^A ^lot ^of ^this ^information ^has ^been ^said ^before. ^I ^am ^not ^your ^definitive ^one ^stop ^shop ^for ^all ^things ^TagPro. ^This ^is ^merely ^observed ^advice. ^Additionally, ^you ^should ^seek ^the ^services ^of ^a ^confident ^professional.

Hello friends and family. I thought I'd start a semi-regular (not weekly) post attempting to cover some TagPro material from unique angles. These *will not* be advanced skills and techniques guides. There are plenty of those which can be found [here in the Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/index#wiki_skills_and_techniques). These *will*, however, be quick articles meant to encourage and instruct players on how to become better at TagPro. 
***
I want to start by answering a very simple question: **How can I become a better player?** 

Here are 10 easy steps to follow to begin the process of becoming a better player:

1. **Listen to constructive criticism.** There are a lot of mean people with dirty mouths. But there are also a lot of nice people with dirty mouths. Listen to the nice people. I've been in many games where more skilled players than I gave helpful advice during or after the game. Don't take this for granted.

1. **Pick a role and excel at it.** You can play both offensive and defense, but few people play both extremely well. Find out what you're best at and stick to it. Not everyone needs to be the offensive "hero". When there are too many running in for the enemy's flag, there is no one left at your base to defend. Likewise, if everyone is on defense, you'll never score.

1. **Be flexible.** While you do want to have a role your best at, be willing to play the opposite role for a game or two. Usually the best strategy is two on offense/two on defense. If someone on your team is dead set on playing O, be willing to roll D for a game for the sake of the team.

1. **Don't play for the score.** Many beginners think that the score displayed at the end of a game determines who is the best. This is simply not true. In a game, focus on helping your team win. Sometimes this will translate to the scoreboard. Sometimes it will not. TagPro is a team game and really shines when players work together and make it a team effort, win or lose.

1. **Be skeptical of speed pads/boosts.** I'm not saying don't use them. Just be wary. They can be used purposefully and with great results. But they can often leave you with the opposite intended effect. 

1. **Learn how to best use power-ups.** Believe it or not, power-ups are powerful. The Wiki contains a [power-up section](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/index#wiki_power-ups) that aptly describes each ability. /u/GekkoPie also created a wonderful [beginner's guide to using power-ups](http://imgur.com/a/n2usj) efficiently. Learn how to use them and then go for them whenever they spawn. In the right hands serving the right purpose, they help your team more than you know.

1. **Learn the maps.** When you are randomly thrown into a new map, roll around and figure out its layout. There might just be hidden areas or nice traps that you can utilize to your advantage. Click to view the [current rotation of maps](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/index#wiki_current_rotation).

1. **Learn the lingo.** GG, MB, and NP mean nothing unless you know the language being spoken. The Wiki contains a great section on [Chat Abbreviations](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/glossary#wiki_chat_abbreviations) so you can be [abreast](http://thegaily.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/006HeartBoobies_V1_W-2.jpg) of quick communication tactics while in game. 

1. **Play a pick-up game.** I just recently [wrote an article](http://redd.it/20wvjq) on how to join PUG games through Mumble. There is a [Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/index#wiki_mumble) and other great posts on the subject as well. One of the main things that helped with my TagPro game was to get out of community games and play with skilled players via Mumble.

1. **Practice the Golden Rule.** Treat others the way that you would like to be treated. Be nice. Be helpful. Be respectful. I know that TagPro is a competitive game that can quickly get heated. I know it is incredibly frustrating to feel like you are awesome and your team is the worst. But we are trying to build a healthy, fun, and friendly community. You can help with this. Don't detract from the hard work that many have put into building this game and community. Treat others the way that you would like to be treated.

Hope this helps us all become better players. Do you have any comments or ideas of what could be added to this list? 

*P.S. I'd love suggestions for future posts if you have any. Message me.* 




 Edited a bit so it is more general rather than just for U.S. Why can't the Americans get it together? 




 Was able to do a write up. Hope it helps guys. 

http://redd.it/20wvjq 




 I probably should add a single line for this. Don't want to go into detail over Mumble tactics, as there are already posts concerning that.  




 ^FYI: ^This ^will ^be ^a ^quick ^walkthrough ^of ^using ^Mumble ^for ^the ^first ^time. ^It ^will ^not ^be ^a ^comprehensive ^ins-and-outs ^of ^Mumble ^guide.

For some, Mumble is an intimidating place to go and try to get involved in. It is much easier to go to the [TagPro Website](http://tagpro-origin.koalabeast.com/), log in, and then click "Play Now" (and believe me, there is no ceremony, you can jump right in). True, you might get called a n00b. Certainly, you might run into the same spike twelve times and cost your team the game. Absolutely, your mother might be called a whore. But these are all risks that you are willing to take because, after all, you only put a limited amount of effort into playing this game in the first place. 

But, you've played for a few months now. You actually enjoy the game. In fact, you are actually getting pretty good at the game. Sure, people still call you a n00b, but you look right back at them and lol in their face while you carry their flag through a tumultuous throng of terrifying tyrants. Casual community play has become something of less intrigue, but you've heard of this mysterious thing called *Mumble*. But it takes commitment. It takes a few minutes worth of set up. You can't just click "Play Now" (no ceremony, jump in). It is a big step to take, no denying that. But if you are interested in learning the basic steps of how to enter into and enjoy the world that is Mumble, read this quick and easy guide to help sooth your doubts.
*****
**I. Defining Mumble**
*****
**Mumble** is a voice over IP (VoIP) application similar to programs such as TeamSpeak and Ventrilo. For tagpro, it's best place to organize pick-up games (PUGs) and also just to talk to other players. The games you play that are set up here are often of significantly higher quality than normal public games. New players who regularly play PUGs often improve faster than those who don't.

/u/DrMcDonald has written up an excellent [Guide to Mumble for Newbies and Dummies](http://redd.it/1uqrhu) that i'd suggest you read for more on this. 

*****
**II. Download and Setup**
*****
* You need to first download the Mumble program from [http://mumble.sourceforge.net/](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/).

Go through some basic setup prompts. You don't have to change any of the preset options unless you really know what you're doing. It is a fairly vanilla program.

* When you see the [Mumble Window](http://i.imgur.com/ZlEWLyg.jpg), you have correctly completed your installation.

* Click Server  Connect  Add New. You'll end up with this [Add Server window](http://i.imgur.com/9GwrYVd.jpg) .

* Input one of the following depending on where you live and where you'll be connecting through.

Label|Address|Port
:---|:---|:---
TagPro Mumble|mumble.koalabeast.com|64738
European TagPro Mumble|mumble-eu.koalabeast.com|64738		
Oceanic TagPro Mumble|mumble-au.koalabeast.com|10054

* Input your own username. Click OK  Connect. Congratulations, you're in.

More setup information (regarding headsets and microphones) [can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/index#wiki_mumble).

*****
**III. Navigating Mumble**
*****
The program [looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/TNq6izL.jpg) once you have gone through the process of logging in correctly. Admittedly, this can look cluttered and confusing thus leading to greater intimidation. Just slow your roll and listen...

There are many "rooms" - some you can go to and some you will need special access to enter. Don't worry about all the clutter, just find the **[PUG rooms](http://i.imgur.com/rLqruiN.jpg)**. In the U.S. Mumble, there are currently three different PUG rooms. Enter one and go through the following steps:

* Listen to see if a game is currently in session. If it is, wait patiently until it sounds like they are done. When they finish, either ask for a link using your mic or type it in the chat box to the left.

* They will provide you with a TagPro group link which, if there is room, will place you into their PUG group. *IF THERE IS NOT ROOM* you will be redirected to the general TagPro Groups page. Don't panic. They aren't trying to get rid of you by subterfuge. Just ask politely for the link again when there is room in the group.

* Once in, you might have to sit as a Spectator for a game or two if there are a lot of people in the group. This is normal, and can actually help you learn as you watch good players play.

* Soon, you will be able to switch off Spectator Mode and join a real live PUG game. 

*[Remember, this is just a basic walkthrough of how to navigate Mumble and play your first PUG. It is not comprehensive. For more information, please visit this [Mumble Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/wiki/index#wiki_mumble) and/or this [Guide to Mumble](http://www.reddit.com/r/TagPro/comments/1uqrhu/a_guide_to_mumble_for_newbies_and_dummies/). If you have further suggestions/edits, please suggest them below.]* 




 If you give me until tomorrow, I will try to write up an explanatory guide to using Mumble for the first time. 




 I'll tell you why Mr. /u/DeweyIsOverrated. It is because Ubisoft intentionally leaks things so that we get super hyped like this. 

My belief is that we will not see concrete theatrical trailer evidence until E3. They want to hype Watch Dogs. But they don't want to leave us assassins behind. They will continue to drop breadcrumbs every couple of weeks to appease us.  




 And subscribed. Thank you for ruining my life. 




 I feel like I need more of this in my life for some reason. Please make this a thing. 




 I know that a dedicated Wiki would be useful for mods and users alike. It can answer a lot of the questions that were in the previous stickied message and a lot more. There are a number of repeated posts (i.e. Which game should I begin with? Will they conclude Connor's story? etc.) that have been answered a hundred times. A Wiki could help tremendously with this.

In regards to rank, I think having a ranking system is fun and intriguing. I do think that the way it is currently being done is difficult. I don't know enough about Reddit to offer alternative solutions, but developing a different system might be necessary. Maybe instead of the words, an icon can depict rank. That's my two cents. 




 In the past, Ubisoft has sped up their trailer releases and game information releases due to leaks. Do you think we will hear something official soon because of this leak? 




 Simple question: Which Chess piece is your favorite and why?

 I've been playing regular community games for a couple of months now and was regularly frustrated by trolls/bad players/quitters/etc. 

I manned up an hopped on Mumble tonight, was playing in a game within five minutes, and everyone was nice and very helpful.

I just wanted to encourage other capable players to try out Mumble and see if PUG games are for you. They are for me.  




 I think those fit you very well. I wouldn't go longer. In fact, I wear mine slightly shorter than that. Really, wear them where it makes you feel comfortable and still looks good. Which seems to be exactly what you're doing. 




 I need a couple pairs of socks for the following:

 I'm not sure that the original image of "Great Fall" was confirmed a fake. I know that some of the "leaked" videos were. 

I personally think it was completely fake, along with Desert Son, but I wouldn't doubt that there will be two releases this year. 




 **http://whatculture.com/gaming/assassins-creed-v-5-things-know-far.php**

**Summary:**

1. *Setting* - Assuming the Industrial Revolution because of Ubisoft Tumblr leak or Russian frontier because of AC Initiates Twitter posts.
1. *Gameplay* - We will probably see a return of the Brotherhood. No oceanic exploration. More stealth features, assassination missions, historical characters, and access to houses and buildings.
1. *Release Date* - Around Halloween/early November. Ubisoft already has a set information/title release date. Very close.
1. *The Protagonist* - Assuming assassin picture leak from Ubisoft offices in Montreal are real, we will most likely see an Industrial Revolution setting due to dark clothes for dirty times.
1. *Multiple Games* - Referencing Great Fall image leak to suggest that there will be a main title (ACV) and another smaller game released in 2014 (possible Great Fall extending from comics).

Thought it was an interesting read, but didn't seem to add anything new. Your thoughts?

**EDIT:** I'm still not sure if AC Redditors know how/when/why to upvote/downvote. I am sharing a link and reporting statements. I am not trying to say they have found anything new. I agree, the article is fairly poor, but no reason to punish me for it. Don't have to upvote. But no reason to downvote a report. 
























 This is nice.

Just threw something together. 

I'm guessing no? 




 Exactly. 




 In regards to the racist and/or offensive names, I think that is something that should be taken care of in a way other than random names. 

Since joining, I've thought that there needed to be a tighter filter on names (both group and personal). Hopefully we can see this some day. Not everyone is all about the vile *grossness* that comes along with with "HairySpankyPeen69" and "D1ldoButtLuv". 




 Woet pls 




 I know it's not the biggest deal in the world, but when someone makes a group and then invites his buddies, no one is able to see the creative name he came up with.

Many times have I created a group making fun of a friend I was inviting to play. Much to my chagrin, they never take notice of my cleverness.

Anyways...I think it'd be reasonable to have the group name translate to the actual group itself. 




 It's been a long time since we've discussed this, and I just got done listening to the entire 4 hour 30 minute FFX soundtrack. So, I was naturally intrigued.

1. Which is your favorite Final Fantasy soundtrack and why? 

1. What is your favorite Final Fantasy song and why?

**EDIT:** You glorious people have just given me a months worth of songs to listen to. I love you all! 




 I hope it was clear that I'm not trying to provide extensive and detailed strategies; rather, I am trying to offer some very generalized and beginners advice from (limited) experience. Seems like you guys are talking specifics, which could confuse a beginner all the more.

Defense is a humble position to play in TagPro. If you do your job well your team and/or the scoreboard might not recognize your brilliance. If you do your job poorly everyone knows (including the scoreboard), and your teammates might start a subreddit about how bad you are (i.e. /r/staertheslippyball). There are some incredible in-depth guides for defensive players that want to improve their skills, most notably are [Felix's Guide to Defense Part 1](http://redd.it/1njysa) and [Part 2](http://redd.it/1rre1k), and [Hob's Guide to Containment Defense](http://redd.it/1uohk0). However, if you would like to follow some simple introductory steps to playing defense in TagPro, hopefully this quick guide can help!
****
###The Five P's of TagPro Defense

1. **PURPOSE** - Discover your purpose as a defender. Typically, there are two players on defense and two on offense. Along with your defensive partner, your primary purpose is to defend your flag, disallowing the opposing team from leaving your base with said flag. Notice that I didn't say that your primary purpose is to refuse access to your flag at all times. Sometimes the best option is to allow enemies to momentarily take your flag so you can swiftly pop them back to their base. If they escape your base with the flag, it is your responsibility to chase after them until they are popped and your flag is back safely at home. There are certainly secondary and tertiary purposes of the defensive position, but as long as you are committed to keeping and returning your flag back to base, you are rolling in the right direction.

1. **PROTECT** - ...your flag: As previously stated, your primary purpose is to guard your flag. The only way the opposing team can score is if they grab hold of and escape with your flag. 

   ...your base: Know when to hold a button and when to let it go. Decide to clear speed pads every 10 seconds or know how they can be used against you and instead use them to your advantage. Bombs are typically not a defender's friend; eliminate them as soon as they spawn (as long as it is safe to do so). Take care of your base so an attacker doesn't use it to take care of you!

   ...your power-ups: As a defender, the main power-up that is useful is Tag Pro. However, it is nice and wise to offer power-ups to your attackers, as it could benefit them most. You want your team to get the power-ups, not the other team. So if necessary, don't hesitate to take a power-up and use it defensively.

   ...your teammate with the flag: This gets tricky and is a little more advanced because you might mess it up and be the reason why your teammate gets popped and the flag returned. But if possible, push enemies away from your flag carrier so that he or she can score.

1. **POSITION** - Sometimes you will want to hover on top of the flag to prevent an opponent from picking up the flag. Most of the time you will want to stay a tile or two away (usually on the opposite side of your opponent) so you can quickly pop them if they perform a "flaccid grab" (grabbing the flag without a real chance of escape, resulting in a pop). If they grab the flag and continue to roll towards you, there is very little you have to do to pop them. If they grab and then roll away, you will have more momentum than they do, allowing you to quickly catch them. Furthermore, you want to zone defend certain "chokepoints" that serve as entry or exit points into and out of your base. Positioning varies map to map and is largely dependent on the skill level of your enemies and your teammates. 

1. **PATIENCE** - Getting juked is the worst. It is also, at times, inevitable. But you can do some practical things to help prevent breaking your ankles on a regular basis. It is often smart to let the opposing flag carrier come to you. Be patient and let them make the first mistake. Remember, they know where they are going, you don't. Refuse to over-commit. If you have to chase, do so with reservation. Drink Felix's advice like a soothing miracle tonic: 

   *The best way to chase is to go where they are going, not where they are.*

1. **PRACTICE** - Practice doesn't make perfect, but it does make you better. Practice  fail  learn  make changes  improve. PUBs (public games) can improve your play, but it is difficult to play adequate defense if your defensive partner is subpar. PUGs (pick-up games) usually host better and more experienced players. I'm not suggesting that you jump into PUGs right away, but do aspire to grow in your skills and aim to take part in PUGs sooner rather than later. 


I hope the Five P's have been advantageous to your progression as a TagPro defender. Now, go forth and defend your flag you impenetrable wall you. 




 Are you home yet? 




 This is wonderful /u/AMorpork. Thanks for doing this. 




 Do dolphins really gang-rape humans? 




 So here's my orderly tactic: 

# Turn screen so passersby cannot see. 
# Turn volume low and mask by background music.
# Act like I am not in the office if anyone calls. 
# Refuse to go to staff meeting or any meeting for that matter. 
# Treat my coworkers like scum because anytime they come into my office they are taking away from valuable time that I could be investing into TagPro. 
# Quit my job as soon as my boss tries to ask me what I'm doing. Like it's any of his business... 
# Pack up office and leave because I was fired before quitting. 
# Return to office late into the night and set whole building on fire. 
# Don't take another job because, frankly, I don't have time. TagPro.  




 Do you play while at work/school? How do you do it without getting caught? If someone walks in, what do you do? HELP ME I'M AT WORK! 




 "Ooo two defenders. Uh oh, another spawning. Great patience. Oh! Oh! Juked! Oh! Double juke! Triple juke! And he's freeeeeee--" 

*Boom! Pop!*

"...Dude..."

Thoughts? Suggestions? 




 What's the story behind this? 




 Upvoting just so we can get to the bottom of this. Spent the whole night listening to a PUG group discuss the bot's tactics and stats. Ready to unplug the bot and move on.  




 I look on Craigslist until my eyes grow sore. Luckily, I am an hour away from a military base where men and women are leaving at a moments notice and need to sell a car. That is often how I get them so cheap.

Just look for a deal and wait patiently for a deal and a deal will present itself! 




 If you are patient and refuse to get "car fever", then you can find an incredible steal of a deal for $5,000.

I recently purchased a 2003 Toyota Camry in great condition, one owner, and 105k miles for $4,000. You can do the same. 




 Just want to mention that /u/JuventinoSenator (Liquid) did an incredible job of hosting Maptesting Monday. He was very professional, organized, and friendly to all that wanted to get involved. 

+10 friends points for being such a cool guy. 




 I can't tell if this is April Fools or real life...

My eyes are running. I no like... 




 Still, even if he was breaking the law in that manner, I don't know if it is justifiable that they would taser him in such a way. I hope that I don't ever get tasered for speeding or jaywalking. That'd just be terrible. 




 Bad video quality I know, but you can clearly hear the entire transaction. 









 Not sure about this one. It is a fun concept, but it came up about five times for me today and it gets old pretty quickly. 




 But have you ever played with squares? 




 This is wonderful. You should have ended it without the escape. It would have been funnier to imagine that the poor square never made it out alive. 




 Thank you for getting on this so quickly, Lucky. The bug had me right pissed off. This isn't some 90 degree bullsheesh. This is TagPro. We're freakin' balls.  




 I'm fine with this. We must remember that they are not working on a game for only a year. They are working on a game for 2+ years before release. 




  I personally would like to see it as an easter egg...

I think this would be a good idea. I enjoy the map and gameplay, but as many have already said, it is a different game type altogether. It is a fun gimmick map, not a regular rotation competitive game. 




 Not sure if you meant that or the opposite. But, I am currently investing 15% of my monthly income into retirement.  




 Great comments here. Let me try to address them as asked:

* I do not have cable or a home telephone. Internet is cheapest I can get. Cell phone could probably go down $15 or so which does add up. 
* I just refreshed my auto insurance so, as far as I can tell, I have the lowest rate available.
* I don't even recall giving them an average mileage. I'd have to look that up somewhere. 




 I would suggest maybe reevaluating how much you're wanting to spend on the house. I'm not sure if $250,000 would be a comfortable purchase for me if I was making less than $30k/year, although I do understand the roommate thing would help. What if you can only get two? What if one stops paying rent because of a job loss? What if you can't get someone to fill an empty room? It sounds like a lot of risk to me.

If I were you, I'd probably consider looking for a less expensive house or even rent for the time being. 




 Interest rate is at an even 5%. 




 I've had a townhouse for four years now. I would like to pay off my mortgage as soon as possible. I have an emergency fund, I am investing a percentage into retirements, and I have no debt.

I have been paying an additional $150 towards principal each month, but that isn't moving the needle quick enough.

I moved through these other financial steps quickly. Now I feel like I am stuck. What are some practical things I could do to help pay off my mortgage as soon as possible? 




 I feel like you aren't sure whether or not to apologize.

"I'm sorry...but it's really your fault. I love you guys...but you gotta stop being butthurt. J/k, It's all my fault, please forgive me. Jerks."

 I know this isn't /r/fitness, but I'd like your opinion on the [Minimus 20v3 Cross-Training shoes](http://www.newbalance.com/Minimus-20v3-Cross-Training/MX20-V3,default,pd.html?dwvar_MX20-V3_color=Blue_with_Silver_and_Yellow start=4 cgid=167000) for regular gym/weight lifting/light-to-medium running shoes. 

I've been searching for a good and good-looking shoe for working out. Help a brother out. 




 Looking to spend no more than $75. 




 Looking for a pair of semi-fashionable athletic shoes. Light running. Heavy gym. To wear with gym shorts and sweats. Suggestions?  




 Thanks for your input. That was a really nice comment.  




 Check the blogs. Black circle is so SS14. 




 What shows you that it is a fake? And who would bother making a fake Ralph Lauren?

[Wearing it.](http://i.imgur.com/0IvoAOa.jpg?1)

[Side pockets. Check out that sleeve billow.](http://i.imgur.com/hpHHd7c.jpg?1)


I am wearing it today. I don't know if I should be. It definitely isn't your typical slim-fitting button down. Wife copped it at a thrift store and we both find it interesting. 

Is it fine as is? Should I wear it as a jacket in the future? Should I toss it out and never wear it again? Thoughts? 




 This guide contains some great information, the only thing is every single bit of it can already be found linked in the sidebar.  




 Get a girlfriend and/or a wife. Stuff your stuff in her purse. Brilliant.  




 Care to elaborate how they easy to make yourself?  




 I've read the important posts on pocket squares. I am not one to spend $40 on a small piece of fashionable cloth. 

What are some good places to shop for stylish (and affordable) pocket squares?  




 My wife and I just finished playing through Bioshock Infinite. She took pictures of our bunny today and sent me this makeshift meme:

 I feel so uneducated. I cannot understand the lingo. I've Googled it all and it hasn't helped. All I'm trying to determine is whether or not my Roth IRA mutual fund is a good (read: successful) one. 

**VGSTX (Vanguard STAR Fund)**

You can give me a yes or no, but please explain what numbers I can look at/for to determine if a fund is good or not. I want the answer, but I also want to learn.

P. S. Please be nice. I've been contributing to this fund for almost 10 years now so it'd be heartbreaking to discover it sucks... 




 I am currently able to incorporate each of these shoes into my wardrobe. That, however, does not mean that they are the right/perfect shoes to compliment my attire. I am hoping to get some guidance on how to weed out some shoes and replace them with others. That's the point of this thread. 




 Here are the shoes I have. What shoes do I need (or need to get rid of) for a comprehensive wardrobe?

 This is kind of an ignorant and generalized post.

Let's not ignore Scripture, please.   

**Proverbs 22:6 - "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."**

Furthermore, there are efficient ways to teach children the principles of Scripture and the Person of Scripture, as there are inefficient ways to teach them. There have been a lot of poor tactics that have been historically used, but that does not mean that we throw out the practice altogether. 

We applaud teaching children how to read, write, practice good hygiene, and play sports. How silly would it be if we failed to teach them the single thing that matters most? 




 [**TagPro Profile**](http://tagpro-origin.koalabeast.com/profile/5349fdcc7e7269a515e60426) and [**TagPro Stats**](http://tagpro-stats.com/profile.php?userid=26728)

Over the last few days I played 101 games on a new account. I wish I could have done 100, but if I understand correctly, you have to play over 100 games for your stats to register fully.

For my first attempt, I came out with a pretty solid Win % (75.25). But, as far as I could tell, everything else is pretty gross. ^^Although ^^I ^^don't ^^know ^^how ^^to ^^properly ^^tell ^^good ^^stats ^^from ^^bad ^^stats.

A few stats for those that are too lazy to click links:

___
* **Games:** 101
* **Wins:** 76
* **Losses:** 22
* **Disconnects:** 3

___
* **Tags/Game:** 6.020
* **Returns/Game:** 4.634
* **Prevent/Game:** 33.000
* **Support/Game:** 5.604

___

I played defense as much as possible. I'm clearly not that great as an attacker. Anyways...

Thoughts? Comments? Is this any kind of accurate depiction of a player's abilities? Did I really have to play through ten thousand Rabbit games in fear of receiving a disconnect upon leaving? Halp. 




 nice encouragement.  




 I was in this game and I think Raven513 (spelling?) abused his ~~mom~~ mod powers...  









 I upvoted your comment but that wasn't enough to express how highly I think of you and your comment. My favorite. Great jorb. 




 I don't know, I happen to think **Juke Juice** might be beneficial. I'm trying to think through all the nuances of such a power. I'd imagine that my instincts and reactions would be quicker. I'd be able to dodge better, jump quicker, and respond speedily, not only run faster. 




 * **JUKE JUICE** would not help you run faster, but would allow you to get to your top speed very quickly. I guess this would not only be the truth when it comes to running, but when it comes to any sort of movement.

* **ROLLING BOMB** would fill you with "unstable energy", allowing you to unleash said energy on command. When turned on, it would also allow you a single-use invulnerability. 

* **TAG PRO** would grant you the power of death, causing the things you touch to quickly wither away to nothing. 

Which would be most interesting to have IRL?
 




  Hello my name is staer, and this is Rorro, we are calling on you and your neighbors to take part in an interesting online game called TagPro. We are wondering if you'd be interested in taking the next step. [Wait for rejection, thank them, and go to the next door.]
 




 Some taggers have multiple players in their home (or one player with multiple accounts). I have found it somewhat difficult to switch accounts. Being that log in is through Google, a user has to go to Google or Gmail to change accounts for TagPro. 

It would be helpful to have a "Switch User" option in each profile so that it can all be taken care of in one tab. 




 Great questions! There is a great amount of evidence to a historical Jesus, and they come from both believers and unbelievers. Here are just a few examples:

###Thallus (52AD)

He was quoted by Julius Africanus in 221AD as trying to explain away the a moment at Jesus' crucifixion: 

*"On the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun." (Julius Africanus, Chronography, 18:1)*

###Tacitus (56-120AD)
One of my favorites. One of the most trusted historians of his time, wrote:

*"Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular."*

###Josephus (37-101AD)
Josephus wrote about Jesus most. He was born just four years after the crucifixion. He would have met men and women that knew of the Christ. 

*"Now around this time lived Jesus, a wise man. For he was a worker of amazing deeds and was a teacher of people who gladly accept the truth. He won over both many Jews and many Greeks. Pilate, when he heard him accused by the leading men among us, condemned him to the cross, (but) those who had first loved him did not cease (doing so). To this day the tribe of Christians named after him has not disappeared."*

There are other examples as well, including Lucius, Celsus, and the Jewish Talmud. There are paintings of the Christ in certain caves around Rome, when believers had to flee and hide due to persecution. If you look, you'll find some good stuff. Most scholars agree that Jesus lived. The chasm in belief comes when you get to his resurrection. 




 Pretty sure TagPro is a 25 year old male law student. 




 Love these items being implemented in the upcoming release. I really do enjoy this game and community, and want to try to do anything I can to help put in the appropriate fertilizer so that this thing can take off and grow over the coming months and years. 




 Eh. I disagree. In that logic, any and every rule is just an invitation for people to break it. Doesn't make sense to me. Rules help to provide a safe framework with which to work inside of in a civil manner.  




 This entire thread is making me laugh. Thank you /u/GrahamMc! Seriously hilarious.

Posting to make sure "Jack MeHoff" is an okay name. Your back up name? "Mike Hunt". Haha. This is too good.

That being said, I 100% agree with /u/quassus - you can do better, man. Come up with something original (and less immature). You can do it. If you are set on something slightly offensive, at least be smart about it. I'll give you a few punable options:

* Mothballs
* Ballieber (playing off of Belieber or whatever for that Justin kid)
* BytheBalls
* Nutz/Nuts/Knutz/Knuts
* TuffKnutz
* Ovaryaction
* SantasSack

But there are also some great less offensive names available:

* Skunk
* Meerkat
* Riot
* LookAtMe
* BallKing
* Gorgeous 




 I just imagine that this would make things so much worse. 




 I value your opinion, but disagree. I hate making the comparison, but that is like saying that everyone who plays League of Legends publicly desires to play competitively, Ranked, or Major League. 

I think there are a large majority that just want a casual, fun, and nice atmospheric game to play when bored. I don't think we can offer them that right now.

**Edit:** I read your comment as "players will always be looking for something more." That's not what you said. However, I'll leave my post as I believe the comparison still stands. 




 Actually kind of like this idea. That gives me the option of "going hardcore and stressing out" in a typical game OR having fun and chilling out in a fun game. 




 * **Effective Reporting System**  Maybe if someone receives three reports in a single game, they are temporarily timed out. This can help weed out some of the weaker trolls/bad guys.

* **Serious Penalties**  Punish repeat offenders. Longer bans  Permanent bans  IP bans. 

* **Name Filter**  I might be alone in this, but I still think it is silly and immature to allow any name under the sun. In my opinion, encouraging filthy names encourages filthy/offensive/rude/coarse language.

* **Honor System**  This has been mentioned and shot down. People should just be nice without an incentive. Sure, but that isnt happening. I think it would be nice to have an honor system with flair awarded to consistently nice and helpful players.

* **Matchmaking**  I know this might come later in the life of TagPro, but some form of degree level matchmaking might help in this. I dont think it needs to be perfect. But this would help to alleviate some of the stress/anger associated with playing on a team full of poor players.

*I'll add more as they come to mind.* 




 I've seen many people recently suggest that in order to get away from the bad players and filthy hate speech to "just play PUGs instead". I get it. I really do. I thoroughly enjoy PUGs (pick-up games), and while I find them more competitive, I find them to be a lot less stressful. But this can't possibly be the *only* solution!

PUBs (public games) are the front door to the TagPro universe. It is the only arena that most TagPro players will ever see. And it should be an okay place to reside and to flourish. Mumble, PUGs, and competitive leagues aren't for everybody, nor should they be. 

I think that there must be some solutions that can be worked into future patches that can help the public community.

I get it, this has been discussed before. But I think something must be done before the community gets polluted to the point of receiving a bad reputation and a bad name. 

Can we collect some ideas that might be able to be implemented in the near future that can help move towards a more healthy public environment? I've included some suggestions below.

**EDIT/P.S.:** I'm not perfect at this by any means. I get frustrated often. So I can relate to the aggressor. I just think there are some preventative measures that can be taken so that public games can once again be a fun place to be. 




 staer 




 You're awesome. I guess it just needs to be updated in the Wiki. Who could do that? 




 I wouldn't ever want to bug /u/NewCompte about a bug. /u/NewCompte, rest knowing that I wouldn't flood your inbox, /u/NewCompte, with way too many tags. /u/NewCompte, you can trust in me fully. However, /u/Newcompte, if you ever have the time to update your extension, /u/NewCompte, could you please update?  




 I know this has been addressed before, but I haven't found a fix.

I've downloaded the [TagPro Sound Chrome Extension](http://redd.it/1tqz4g). It works fine on all servers except for Origin. Under my "Extensions" tab, I see that it doesn't have permission for Origin. I don't know how to change this though. Don't even know if I can.

Is anyone else having this problem? How can I fix it?


(I'll remove the post if you can redirect me to a post with a solution.) 




 Don't have a mouse. GG.
