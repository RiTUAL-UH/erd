 I wanna lick you.
 




 It's funny. I was thinking that you were a beautiful child when I looked at this. Even though you had long hair as a kid, still. 




 Um, you were always adorable. Dat smile.
 




 Neil Patrick Harris?

Also, you are attractive. Wow. 




 DAMN. 




 God you are so good at this. 




 Apparently, you look like several different celebrities. And asian. 




 That's gonna be one handsome little devil. 




 It was just before my 17th birthday. It was unprotected, in the laundry room, up against a dryer. We tried four different positions and lasted a good half hour, surprisingly, because it was the first time for both of us. And, 'til this day, the sight of a dryer turns me on. 




 Whyyyyy would someone downvote this. 




 Flushing the toilet. 




 When I read this, I read "evil-doer" as "evil-deer" 




 Holy crap. Please tell him that he looks gorgeous.
 




 La Crosse, WI 




 i think /r/ladyboners would like you. 




 Your dog is Fizzgig. 




 For some reason I am imagining you drunk. 




 Well. I don't want my soup anymore.
 




 I think I puked, but I'm not sure because of the disgusting sensory overload this comment just gave me. 




 I almost shit my pants seeing my username. For two incredibly stupid and perhaps conceited seconds, I thought that this post was dedicated to me.
  




 I have so many, I can't even pick. I have nightmares every night. I am also a very vivid dreamer, which is nice when I'm having a good dream, but usually I'm not. Probably five nights out of seven I wake up and have a hard time differentiating between reality and non-reality because every detail in the dream is exactly the way it looks, feels, tastes, smells and sounds like in real life. It is perfect to the level of Inception. But I will tell three of my particularly disturbing dreams, in chronological order.

The first disturbing dream I remember happened when I was five years old. I had a dream that trees were mad that humans were using them for paper and our own selfish needs and so they revealed that they could talk (they actually looked a lot like the trees in the Wizard of Oz, except more menacing) and they took over the world. There were particular types of trees, like the birch and the sequoia (among others), that they had rejected because they were "peaceful" and didnt want to harm the humans. Anyway, the dominating tree types had put all humans in concentration camp-looking places and at meal times they gave us a plate with three different types of bark on it. Two  of the types were from the "dominating" tree races that had died naturally and the other was from the "lesser" trees that they had killed. If you were lucky youd get something like birch, because if you happened to eat the bark from the dominating trees, you were deemed unworthy to serve the trees because you were unable to differentiate between your "masters" and your "enemies." In the dream, I was sitting on my cousin's lap (she used to babysit me a lot) and I remember picking up my fork and pointing to each one. She had become great at telling the difference so she always helped me. She told me which one not to eat, and because I was a child, of course I ate that one. Immediately, the tree-guard standing by me picked me up and threw me into its gaping mouth. It digested me and I could feel my legs burning as I heard my cousin's hysterical screams. Then I woke up.

The second one was when I was about thirteen or fourteen. I had watched Disturbia with one of my friends and about a month later, I had this dream. I was sitting on the couch, watching static on the TV as it stormed outside. The way our house was set up, you could see all the way to the back door in the kitchen two rooms away from the living room. Lighting crashed and i saw a shadow of a man in the livingroom. I looked to the right and I saw the Killer from Disturbia staring into the glass of the back door. The light from the static on the TV barely reached him, so the shadows made his eyes look like empty sockets. We stared at each other for a good ten seconds before he opened his mouth ghoulishly wide and screamed in rage. He started trying to smash the window in and I bolted upstairs and leaped underneath the covers. In my dream, I poked my finger through one of the holes that was *actually in my covers in real life*. I pulled out some of the polyester filling nervously and started playing with it, hoping he wouldnt find me. Suddenly, I heard loud rapping on my window that was right across the room from my bed. It thundered again, and I realize now that this is when I woke up, but in real life I could still hear the rapping at the window, and I was still playing with the filler because I had taken it out in my sleep. I lied in bed for a good hour before I peeked out from under the covers and saw a tree branch tapping on my window and realized it wasn't real. My body ached for a couple days after that from that hour of tensing up in pure terror.

The last one I'll tell happened last night. I'll tell you an abridged version since this comment is already way too long. Basically, my boyfriend and I started living with these people who were in a cult and lived in the shittiest, low down abandoned house you can imagine. Think Fight Club but multiply the shittiness by about ten. I went into the bathroom in our room to wash my face, and i opened the mirrored cabinet door to find a cut up baby and its face was right on the level of my face. I was frozen. And then it smilled and laughed at me. Its mouth started spurting blood along with its other body parts. In the dream I had just found out I was pregnant.  




 I'm not sure if this is mean or not, but it made me really angry. I am not one bit overweight and my (now ex) boyfriend told me that I should work out because he "wanted to see what it was like" to see me smaller. And then he said, "If I dont like it, I'll tell you to gain weight back." Then, after a little more thinking on his part, he said, "Nevermind, I like you the way you are. Don't do anything."

I never said that I didnt like the way I looked or anything, and he never took into consideration what i wanted my body to look like. It was just as if he owned it and could tell me what to do with it.  




 No. 
Your cat's high. 




 The first song I heard by them was Panic Switch and I instantly obsessed, but then it sort of died out a little. I forgot about this song for a while and now im hooked again. 




 I know that feel, bro. I'm basically still a lurker, except I'm the Oprah of upvotes. 




 Does anyone know what I'm talking about when I say that this is maybe a million times worse than Talking Tina from The Twilight Zone? 




 I regularly babysat for my neighbor's daughter, and the day this happened was just a regular day. We were walking to the park, and in the parking lot she saw a puddle that had oil in it, which was making a rainbow. She looked at it and looked up at me to see that I had seen it as well. I smiled back at her. We didn't mention it for the rest of the night. It was just one of those mundane and seemingly insignificant occurrences.

I feel I should also mention that she hardly ever talked except to say something absolutely brilliant and creative, except she was a little morbid.

 I was scared to see her at night, since she looked like a typical little girl that should have been in a horror movie (blue eyes that pierced through your soul, pale with very dark brown hair that could have been black, nightgown etc.) and it was usually at night when she woke up to deliver one of these glimpses into her strange little mind.

She had gotten out of bed absolutely silently and had stepped slightly in  front of me, where I was sitting on the couch, watching TV. I jumped a little. Never got used to it.

She asked me, "That rainbow? That we saw on the ground today? It fell from the sky, and it died, didn't it?" Then she got really close to my face.  "And you just SMILED." 

I was too creeped out to go back there. Now when I see one of those puddles on the ground I get shudders. Her mind must be a scary place. 




 Best comment I have read all day. 




 Oh my god. These kids are terrible...it makes me wonder what kind of things they have experienced to be able to do that to someone...such bad things happen in this world.  
























 I would suggest a curling wand. I have long hair and it works wonders for me. Some can be expensive, like between $100 and $200 but the one I have is ConAir brand and its right at the top of your price range. They can run for a lot more expensive than $40 so I thought it was a pretty good deal.

I suggest a wand because it doesn't have a clamp, so you don't get that annoying little kink at the end when you try to curl your hair. All you do is wrap your hair around it, hold it there for a bit, and let it go. It makes really tight curls or really bouncy beach waves depending on the size of the section you are wrapping. The bigger the section, the bigger the waves. 

Also, if it's your first time using it, be careful! It's really easy to burn yourself on it. 




 That dog is so cute! I know this isn't the point of your post, but could I get a better look at your tattoo? I kinda like tattoos...a lot. 




 That creepy smile.... 




 When I heard they were from La Crosse, I thought to myself, "Oh dear lord. I hope I know at least one of them." 




 this is really sad.
 




 The best part is the empty chip bag. 




 To me she looks like Kaley Cuoco, I don't know if I'm just crazy or what.
 




 Assuming you are referring to the Bible, I'm pretty sure that set of laws from Leviticus were for Jewish people before the time of Jesus. They are not Christian. 




 But if he said that, it would be interpreted as a pickup line and not a dig. He thought she was pregnant because she was *glowing,* not because he thought she was fat.  




 Smooth as fuck. 




 I came here to say exactly this. Upvote for you. 




 My brother and I are close in age, and my little sister is tall for her age and has abnormally large feet. I am 18 and she is 12 and her feet are almost bigger than mine.

Anyway, when we were kids, my mom always bought us all socks that looked almost identical, and we would all have screaming matches over whose socks we had. Pretty stupid. 




 I worked at this one fairly successful family-owned restaurant as a waitress where the two owners hardly ever hired men, made at least one waitress cry every day, treated the hispanic workers like shit, and where they discriminated against and harassed the pregnant women.

 It was the most stressful thing that I have ever had to do. At the time, I was 17 and I had school, but they were hesitant to work with my schedule. At first they gave me too many hours a week for me (about 28-30) and then they gave me too little hours (about 10). Also, there was one time where I worked a 12 hour day and got one 20 min break. I'm not entirely sure about the legality of that situation, but it certainly felt illegal. 

Also, if you made a mistake, the owners weren't afraid of yelling at you in front of the customers and they would also smack-talk you to the people sitting at your table. It once was so bad that the customers at my table actually stood up for me and told one of the owners that they were never coming back because of the way they treated their waitstaff. That day, the owner tried to fire me because of that situation. My only mistake was that the customer wanted pecan pancakes and I accidentally typed in regular pancakes. I almost let her fire me, but I needed the job and the tips could be great on a good day. 




 This is absolutely ridiculous. "What's the lasting effect on two young boys being sent to jail?" well what's the fucking effect of RAPE ON THE VICTIM.

Also, they made it sound like the fact that there was alcohol made it okay that she got raped.

And so many other things that I could just rant about 
 




 So that was terrifying.

 We broke up during our first couple months at college. I thought I was still in love with him then, and all I wanted to do was just talk to him. I wanted nothing more than to get back together with him. Then, later on he came to visit me the weekend before Thanksgiving break. We went to a party together, and I got drunk, but he didn't drink a single drop. By the time we got back, I was still a little tipsy. I got into bed, and he pulled out a condom and asked me if I wanted to have sex. Of course, drunk little test_subject8773 said yes. And it wasnt only the alcohol, I had genuine feelings for him. He had sex with me, finished in five minutes, then went to bed and hadnt touched me other than to put his dick in me. I asked if we could cuddle and maybe he could touch me a little and he told me that he was too tired and that cuddling would be uncomfortable and make him too hot. The next morning I asked if we were going to get back together, and he said "I dont know, my parents don't really like you all that much and I don't know if we should get serious again." Keep in mind, we lost our virginities to each other about a year and a half beforehand, and I was the only person he ever had sex with. That is still true today. It's not even like hes this big player who doesnt care about girls. He does. He just doesnt care about me. 




 "Kickin in the front seat, chillin in the back seat, gotta make my mind up, which seat can I take??" 




 Wow, this is awesome!
 




 Only child? 




 Do you have a link to that AMA? 




 Mmm. 




 why is a repost this blatant on the front page. 




 I just got goosebumps all over just watching that. ewewewewewew 




 wat 




 Did she have siblings? If she did, maybe she was verifying her own feelings about them. Maybe she feels that she doesn't love her sibling or wouldn't cry if they died.  




 Not gonna lie, this would scare the shit outta me every time I walked into the bathroom. Even if I were the owner. 




 What a motherfucker. 





























 [Here you go.](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs5/1978595_o.gif) Makes me cringe a little for the girl though. Yeesh.

Jiffy! 00:33-00:37 




 Thanks!
 




 Thanks! 




 Thanks for the suggestion, I hadn't thought about doing that! 




 Ive kinda been doing baby steps into keto, like much less carbs and lots more veggies and protein, but I still give myself some allowances sometimes instead of just changing cold turkey. 

I also just finished my first year of college, and it having been summer vacation and being home really has changed a lot of things. I eat a lot less at meal times and I tend to snack less. 

I try to get out and powerwalk for about a half hour a couple times a week, but I really do owe most of my weight loss to my diet. 

The loss has been since probably the beginning of June, so maybe a month, maybe more? 

And thank you, I really do appreciate your kind words. The problem with these pictures, though, is that they are at a slight upward angle. It is really different with better lighting, and when I look at myself in one of those all angle mirrors, I do look a little different. For example, this is a picture taken of me on the fourth of July [(I'm on the left).](http://i.imgur.com/vst2Irt.jpg) My legs look great, and I have a bit of a food baby, so just disregard that roundness, but I do have some fat left in my arms and face that I want to get rid of. And I know its possible for me to be 125 again because that's what I was a year ago at the same height! haha 









 How did you do it? because my starting weight is 138 as well and i want to get down to 125, and we are also the same height. 




 Youre my inspiration, holy crap.
 




 Hey, I know that it's kind of late to be commenting, but as a 62 kg f/18/5'4" trying to lose about 4.5-6 kg, I have to know. Did your boobs get smaller? I really like where mine are at right now (so does my boyfriend) and I can only imagine that I would be kind of sad about it. Did yours get smaller, and how did you feel about it? 




 what was the music in this?
 




 It would go nice with card that says "Eat Shit." 




 I usually wouldn't say anything about this, but this post made me cringe. The amount of misogyny, accidental or not, on Reddit really shouldn't surprise me, but it never fails to. "You're plus sized, but you've found a way to make yourself look more appealing for my benefit, even though your physical appearance has nothing to do with me? Good girl." Yikes, guys. 




 You clever bastard. 




 You can unsubscribe to /r/atheism so that you never have to see that again. 




 Congratulations! Wow, she really loves you. I don't know if I could tell my SO the same thing. I bet she is lovin' your new body as much as you do! 




 Dang, you are HOT. 




 My friend got his last name down his side, and is planning to get his mother's maiden name down his other side. It's like a tribute to both sides of his family, sort of. 




 Sneezing when it doesn't indicate that they are sick or when it doesnt have any foreshadowing purposes. Just sneezing.
 




 what was the comment?
 




 Thank you, this is really cute! Sorry I took so long to reply, I haven't been on reddit lately. 




 /r/mildlyinfuriating is your home, brother
 




 Oh, duh. I'm sorry. I got all mixed up with usernames. Yeah, shoulder-length hair might be hard to do with a wand. 




 Your hair is definitely long enough; I have a friend whose hair is your length and I have curled it many times before. Sometimes it's hard to get the hang of it because the hair tends to slide off when you curl it, especially if your hair is freshly washed or really shiny and smooth. I'd start at the thick end of the barrel and wrap down, because the hair does slip a bit. Also, make sure you are doing it tight enough.  




 I love this. I wish I could give you more upvotes. 




 I read this and wanted to downvote something, but I wasn't sure what. Then I realized I just wanted to give Reddit one big downvote. 




 Random side note...you look like OAG. 




 I absolutely adore your natural color, so I don't think you should dye it, but If you're looking for a change, I'd say dark chocolate brown hair would look great on you, especially if you got a pixie cut. You could definitely pull that haircut off.

I'm not sure if you meant colorful as in blue or pink hair or something like that, so if you did, i think a blue-fade-to-purple ombre with a pixie cut would look great. It would go great with your eyeshadow. :) 
























 Im so excited for this! Placeholder! 




 Its actually a mix between two colors: Revlon colorstay matte balm in the colors Audacious and Showy. I put Audacious on over Showy to make a pinky-coral. And I got it dyed professionally the first time, but I used L'oreal Hi-Color Hilights in Red, which is the same color as the salon color, and I continue to use that on my roots. But when I touch up the middle and ends of my hair I use Beyond the Color Zone in Wild Red! Hope that helps! 




 Thank you! 









 Good, I'm glad I could be some help!
 




 Thanks, I have been trying to figure out the best way to make the most of my lashes for years so I really appreciate that! :) 




 I kind of do a combination of both? Haha. If you're going to do the wiggle, do it right at the root of your lashes and then swipe the rest of the way up. I find that way works best for me. And if you want added length, what I do is close my eye and put some mascara just at the tips so it really builds at the ends instead of building thicker in the middle. Hope that helps! 









 Aw, thank you! 




 Haha, thanks, I appreciate that! I'm always worried about looking like I'm wearing too many colors. 




 Wow, this is absolutely gorgeous! I love that lip color on you. I would say that if you want your features to stand out more in pictures, you might wanna turn up the drama on your eyes so that your beautiful features don't get lost in the distance! Perhaps that's not the look you want to go for, but that's what I would recommend. :) 




 Thank you!

 thank you :3 




 I was going through these contests with my friends and your Disney one totally caught our eye! They urged me to do an Ariel inspired look, since my hair is bright red, and I've absolutely loved the movie since I was a child. I hope that everything goes okay at the hospital! Enjoy!  http://imgur.com/a/ccX3J#0

Edit: Totally sorry for the potato quality. I dont have a real camera lol. 




 Is your puppy a Yorkie-Poo? He looks exactly like my dog at my parents' house. I miss him so much now that I saw your dog.  




 Man, you really need to work on your tact and your people skills in general.... 




 Wow, you remind me so much of Lorde. 




 Thanks so much! will definitely be getting this one after reading about it. 



















 I just came here to say that you made a beautiful choice! The hair cut and color makes you look like a different person entirely. I love it! It's so cute! 




 Holy shit. I wouldn't even spend that much money on MYSELF.  









 I think your eyebrows are gorgeous. Your eyes and lip color are also very pretty, but I think that if youre going to have super sparkly bold eyes like that, you need to balance them out with a more nude lip color, and if youre going to go with the bold lip color, a more neutral eye look would do best. Right now the colors are kind of taking over your face rather than enhancing it. My rule is that I pick one thing about my face I want to show off that day and enhance it,
 




 The fucking kitchen scissors. I dont even need them all that often but i see them every day UNTIL I need to use them. 
























 Thanks for doing this contest! This is my boyfriend's favorite movie, and the movie we watched together when we had our first kiss :) So here is my [inspiration.](http://i.imgur.com/8HHM6g5.jpg) :) 

I figured that since it was a romantic scene, I would do a romantic look. My phone's camera sucks, so you cant really see how vibrant the colors are, but I loved the amount of color and life in the movie, especially the oranges and blues and purples. [Here's mah face.](http://imgur.com/a/VW05s) Hope you enjoy!

 




 I LOVE MA FACE!!

Here are my[ pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/9qWZy#WKGXawB)

First off, I have a scar (that's barely noticeable anymore) on my nose. I got it in Kindergarten when I had the chicken pox. I ran into a wall face first and it scraped off! I love telling that story. I used to hate it because it was a little deeper back when I was young but I think its cute now. 

Second, it might be hard to see but I have three beauty marks on my face. They're close to my hairline on my temple and the third is higher up on my forehead.

Third I have just one dimple! I like this because I never discovered this until I took some senior photos when I was 17. I hardly have any pictures of me actually smiling because I used to be very self conscious about my teeth.

Fourth, my teeth. I always hated them until I got to college. I never wanted to smile with my teeth. My parents couldn't afford braces and so I never got the front two fixed. But now I appreciate that it makes me unique. My boyfriend always tells me I have a cute smile and so I had to put this in here, because I know he will see this. Love you!

Fifth, and lastly, my nose. I used to despise it because of the chicken pox scar and because of how wide it is, but I have learned to embrace it. People never believe me when I tell them that I am part African American from my mother's side. I am proud to be black, and the only features I have to show for it are my dark eyes, darker skin tone, and my nose. The other parts of me, French, German, Irish, and Native American, have definitely managed to shine through as well, haha. 

Hmm. I would say I'm special because I care about everyone and try to help everyone with everything, even if I can see that sometimes they're taking advantage of me. A little kindness goes a long way, I say.  




 Thanks! I only have my ears pierced once, so I'm going to start on those. I want to have my ears double pierced with a cartilage piercing on one ear and after that get triple forward helix piercings on both ears :) 




 Not to give any discredit to the piercer, but she seemed to be in quite a hurry when she did it. I came in and already knew that I wanted a horseshoe. She just picked a size, pierced me, gave me some directions on how to clean and sent me on my way. I was so excited and it all happened so fast that I didn't even realize that she didn't tell me what size mine is :( and now I'm not even in Eau Claire anymore, so I have to go to the place I usually go and try and have that place size it. 

I wish I could help you out more!  




 Thanks :) I'll have to ask someone about that. I haven't had any problems so far, but I'll look into it.  




 Thank you so much! :) 














 Holy crap I went in the comments to see if this was the tiny town where my University is located by and sure enough. 




 The other people who commented already said what I was going to say about your contour, but dang, you remind me so much of Adele! 




 You picked the wrong sister. 




 Jaja, gracias! :) Eres de los Estados Unidos, u otro pais? 




 Darn it 




 yeah, it takes me directly to my album. I don't know what's going on! 




 Wait a minute, for me it doesn't look like it didnt link correctly
 









 Thank you! 




 Yes! Well at least I think so. Even my boyfriend's brother noticed how smooth my face looked and heaven knows that's some kind of miracle 




 Gracias! He listado mis productos favoritos en otro comentario! 

Haha I appreciate the Spanish. 




 Oh goodness. If I had to pick one it would be Rimmel's Stay Matte Primer. I have pretty dang oily skin, so it really helps with that. It feels kind of thick going on, but it tones down the oiliness and helps me maintain a dewy finish. It's probably one of my favorite finds because I had searched for months for a good primer and I finally found it. Also, Clump Crusher. I can't live without it, and I can't find a mascara I like more. Another one would have to be Revlon's Colorstay Matte Balms, because they are so easy to apply and I can't be bothered some days to whip out my lipstick and my lipstick brush and try to perfectly line my lips and all of that.  




 So, I kind of broke a rule (oops) as I've posted before without doing an intro. /u/blanksy was kind enough to remind me in chat that I needed to do one!

Anywho, I just wanted to say that I love this subreddit, and love the idea of having contests and being able to commit random acts of kindness within the context of makeup. This subreddit is so supportive and kind. I reaallllly love makeup and have a growing collection. My friends think I'm crazy obsessed, but they don't mind so much when they need someone to do their makeup, haha. I've only recently had the ability to start feeding into my hobby more in terms of finances and RAoM really makes me feel like I have a home and a comfortable place to showcase what I have learned over the years. Thanks for that!

My other hobbies include singing, reading, and listening to music. I also study Spanish so if anyone here speaks Spanish or is also learning we can practice together. I think that's it! Keep being fabulous! 




 I would say that my biggest thing about doing makeup on other people is that I might have to adjust some things according to who I am putting the look on, even if I'm trying to achieve the same thing for several different people. This is especially true for different eye types. 

When I do makeup on other people, I realized the thing that gave me the most trouble is doing their liner, especially wings, which I have a feeling you are going to be making use of. On yourself, it is much easier to close your eyelid or start from the inner corner or the middle and draw the wing out that way. I suggest that you have them look straight on at you, and you draw the wing first, so that you can draw a wing that is appropriate for the type of eye they have, otherwise it could look a bit cartoonish or just flat-out ridiculous. 

Also, I would say if you have someone with hooded eyes, you might want to search a couple youtube tutorials about maximizing their lid space. I have friends with hooded eyes who feel that eyeshadow is a lost cause on them when it really doesn't have to be that way! One important thing I always try to remember is to make sure that if you do anything sparkly or dramatic on someone with a hooded eye, you should try to put whatever crease color you are using (if youre using one) a little bit above their actual natural socket, because otherwise the shadow gets lost. 

If you would like a little bit of advice about different eye shapes, [this eye shape video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9bdkpypZKElist=UUCvoAe__WFYMNAEN-C-CtYA)
 is very helpful because he provides examples of celebrities with those different shapes. He also just did [a smokey eye tutorial for hooded eyes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq3EB4NepKYlist=UUCvoAe__WFYMNAEN-C-CtYA) which you might also want to take a look at.

Hope this helps a little! Have fun!
 




 Why thank you! I guess that's what happens when your mother is half black and your dad is a blond haired blue eyed German! haha.  




 Thank you, I'm always worried that there are too many colors on my face haha
 




 Thank you so much! Wow, what a compliment. She is absolutely gorgeous.  




 Thank you :) 




 Thank you! I used Clean and Clear Morning Burst moisturizer, Rimmel's Stay Matte Primer (which really gives me more of a dewy look because I have oily skin) and Maybelline's FitMe liquid foundation in the shade 120. I apply the foundation with a stippling brush, which gives me more of a smooth finish! I also used a little bit of blush that's a really generic, cheap brand that I don't even remember the name of anymore, haha. The primer is awesome...its really thick and I find it fills my pores and keeps my makeup from slipping around all at the same time. 




 Thanks so much! I actually use Elf's Cream liner in Black and an angled brush to apply. I used to use liquid, but I find I like the more matte look of the cream better :) 




 Thanks!
