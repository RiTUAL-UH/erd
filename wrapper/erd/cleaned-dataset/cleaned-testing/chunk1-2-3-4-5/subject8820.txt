 hope this could be helpful i would like some comments and suggestions  


































 just started doing videos about cooking tips in  youtube and hope this video is not that bad and could be helpful at some point 
i would appreciate if you post some comments or suggestions    









 good point thanks for your comment 
























 true am just sharing one of the ways with others , thx for ur comment 




 hhh that was very easy way  




 ok thanks for your comment 
























 first the video was made simple so everyone could understand and learn how to make an omelette  in general and am not saying that my video is the best or perfect in the world beside the main reason of the video is to help some people to learn how to cook ...
friendly = i appreciate all comments and thanks for taking time writing your point of view  




 no problem i always welcome comments and suggestions  




 the omelette i was showing could be stuffed as in the video and you roll it or it can be plain, but if you talking about fritatta =( thats when you mix eggs with vegetable : to have like tart) that's something else 
thank you for your comment :)
