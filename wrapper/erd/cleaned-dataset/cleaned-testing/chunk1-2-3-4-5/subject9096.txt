 I do wish the CBS Sports stream would quit crapping out. ROLL TIDE!! 









 Pffft we will be in the ACC long before then. :P 




 Good article. I asked a groundskeeper if they got hazard pay for football games. He said no. :(

Everyone did get holiday pay, since it was Thanksgiving break. 




 Me either.

 According to someone on Facebook with a police scanner, they apprehended a suspect before they gave the all clear. 




 They haven't evacuated the Carroll building, package may be a science project. 




 Sunbelt gets four tie-ins next year. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.

 Our final NCAA appeal was denied, so I don't see how we can unless some bowl committee just decides to be a rebel. 




 I see what you did there. 




 [I'm partial to this for the Championship](http://i.imgur.com/To8hyMm.jpg) 




 Alright then. Rings all around, gents! 




 I think when we were FCS we only had rings made for our 6 National Championships, but I could be wrong. I can't find a link anywhere that says one way or the other.

 "Undefeated Sunbelt Champs Celebrate Season with Pizza Party, Cosmic Bowling" 




 It's our first season in the FBS.  




 Yes Fritz did really well. Our kicking frustrated me, as well as the whole 'drop back six yards to gain two' thing our QBs kept doing. He did awesome, and I could tell he was invested in the boys. But we cannot afford complacency.
 




 Why thank you :) 




 http://gseagles.com/news/2014/12/2/FB_1202141600.aspx 




 Georgia Southern fans travel VERY well (the University often sponsors bus trips) so that is not a legitimate argument against them playing. 

*kicks stupid rule* 




 Because we miss waaaay too many extra points. 









 In your own defense, it was a subtle taunt engineered to target only GaState fans. :) 




 *sadly kicks pebble around* 




 Source for this? :( 




 69-31 was an impressive win IMHO. :P 




 Another reason I'd like to see Southern play a bowl: Matt Brieda. 

He's a finalist for the Doak Walker award and more game time can only help his chances. The guys he is competing against all get that extra game. 




 Plus, Georgia southern has no transfer players in their roster. 




 Yea you're right, got confused. 




 Georgia Southern was barred from postseason FCS games last year because of the transition, but that was a team wide application. 

This page has some good info for individual athletes.

http://www.athleticscholarships.net/college-transfer-4-4.htm 




 I believe that just such a situation is what the rule was created to prevent. 

However Georgia Southern has zero transfers and significantly less scholarships than other sunbelt teams, which is why we are appealing. 




 Yeah, the stupid rule thing is my main argument. We have met (and exceeded) all the FBS qualifications. We wouldn't have made the transfer if we didn't. I'm bummed out that we are the only conference champs whose season is (probably) already over. I'm bummed out for the senior players who stuck it through the transition, beat Florida in the Swamp, earned an undefeated conference championship, and now have to watch teams they beat go play on the national stage instead. Give me a ONE MORE TIME!!  :) 




 I'm not sure what our chances are, but it would be nice. Our boys played their hearts out this season. HAIL SOUTHERN! 









 Nope, just a tech fan but thanks for playing slugger! 




 Lol thanks much. It does suck :(  




 Yea poor GSU ball :( 




 No worries, different approaches. :) 




 Lmao that would be the boyfriend I credited my post to. Too funny. 




 This was my boyfriend's suggestion.  









 Yes. Yes it is. 




 We are in a transitional season since we moved up from the SoCON last year. It's a NCAA rule. We put in a waiver request but we're denied. We have appealed the decision. We are 8-0 Sunbelt Champs and 9-3 overall in our first FBS season. Teams we squished will be going instead of us. :( 




 Lol 




 http://imgur.com/8s4MPqp 




 http://imgur.com/8s4MPqp 




 Yea I noticed that too hehe but we have had that blue and white uniform style since Erk brought the program back because it was all we could afford. I think it's very classy. 




 http://imgur.com/8s4MPqp 









 It was really nice to see Youyoute get some good ball time in his last game. :) 
























 We made it to the table of 32. But still... HAIL SOUTHERN 




 [Next year we get the Cure Bowl in Orlando against an AAC team](http://curebowl.com)

The fifth bid starting in 2016 is actually gonna be on a rotational basis between a handful of conferences.  




 Sun Belt gets a fourth bowl bid next year, and a fifth after that. But Georgia Southern and CrApp State will be eligible so Texas might miss out again. :P 




 Yeah Georgia Southern is just buried in that article. :( 




 Lol Georgia Southern went 9-3 in their first season in the FBS and came within a score of beating both our ACC opponents this season. We ain't no cupcake team. 




 Aww sorry Sam Houston Bro. :( We are taking good care of him! 




 HAIL SOUTHERN :) 




 LOL I never thought about it that way but you are right. :) 









 Ooh that's neat! I like the buddy ticket idea. I'm sad you can't sit on the hill anymore though. :( 




 I work for UA Museums. Love it!  




 When I was at Georgia Southern (I graduated in '12) the football games were free if you paid your athletic fee (about 150? but it included other things like renovation costs and the rec center access too).

I work for the University of Alabama and they run a fac/staff season ticket lottery based on seniority. You have to buy the whole season. 




 Why not State of Georgia University Panthers? 




 [Here this friendly PSA should clear up any confusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=putYM15zC0Y feature=youtu.be) 




 [NO](http://mylolface.com/assets/faces/angry-no.jpg) 




 I get so sad that people still get confused by this. :( 




 Overall an exemplary season for the Panthers. They do a good job keeping Paulson North warm for us. 




 Hey they did their best to only win by one point. Don't be too hard on em. 




 Awesome. That makes me happy. 




 GSU AD actually reached out to the NCAA about doing it. Betcha can guess what those bastards said. :( 




 NCAA- Not Controlling Athletics Association /s 




 Kleinlein is a stand up guy. 









 All of them. The answer is all of them. 




 I bet someone down Auburn way might take him. ;) 




 I'm glad we could help you guys reach 15,006 average attendance.
 




 OK I'm gonna use Alabama, because I work there. [They had eight players drafted in 2014](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Alabama_Crimson_Tide_players_in_the_NFL_draft).

Their starting kicker, Cade Foster, was not among them. He is now a free agent. 

Players like that, who don't get drafted yet expected to. What kind of a future can they look forward to? What's the likelihood they will get picked up? Do they have skills they can fall back on if not? I'm legitimately concerned. The graduation - employment rate is low enough as it is. I should know I am a (gainfully employed!) recent anthropology grad. :) 




 If their coaches are not properly educating their players about what a long shot it is (about 3% according to the NCAA website, but that's across all divisions) then they are doing those kids a disservice. I'd really like to know what happens to the kid who stakes all his hopes on getting into the NFL and prepared for no other option. What does he do? Flip burgers? 




 Yeah but they're not all gonna get drafted.
 




 I enjoyed the analysis of this article and I'd like to see the data from other Universities. I feel like this should all be public information for any public institution. 




 I always implore our defense to squish 'em, but I never claimed to not be weird. 




 GREATEST THING 




 Georgia Southern was the first team to be undefeated in conference/outright champs in the first year of transition since the rule was made. 

Still sad panda. :( 




 I read somewhere that ODU wasn't eligible either because of transition. 




 I think you got down votes because most Georgia Southern Fans don't think very highly of UGA even though we can't really be considered football 'rivals.' A lot of it goes way back to when Erk Russell left UGA to start our program. Some of it has to do with how hard they fought to block us becoming a University as well. We like Tech though. 




 HAIL SOUTHERN 




 YES 




 Yes, that is also a good one because it shows us being classy in our celebrations. 




 So we should change it to mountain goats, or what? 




 LOL @ CrApp State Sheep and Sad Georgia State ball. :)

 I would attend this game.

However wouldn't Georgia Southern get in trouble? :( 




 The difference is Georgia Southern went 8-0 in conference play and holds an outright championship.

EDIT TO ADD- And we are the first team to have done so since the rule was implemented. 




 Almost like they are rewarding certain conferences for having an actual championship game... Hmmm ;) 




 Those boys are not giving up... LOVE IT GO JACKETS

They have a cold bar that everyone has access to and then a nice looking menu you order from. The cold bar has some shellfish, cured meats and cheeses from Scandinavia. There are some wonderful sounding Scandinavian entrees as well that we are excited about! I should mention that Akershus is a Princess meal.

 Important question re the new Bluray edition: Did they get rid of Morrison's Boba Fett redub? :/ 




 *claps* 




 Yeah, that's what my W2 says, not counting SS/Medicare. 




 What? No wai. ;____; 




 It says 969.63. I'm beginning to suspect my W4 is not right, and I got lucky last year. 




 Alright, just me then. Thanks! 




 I changed jobs in 2013, but there wasn't any space between them. That is an awesome tool! Our accountant at work advised me to redo my W4 and I will definitely be using that. Thanks! 




 Can you claim yourself as a dependent? I have never found a satisfactory answer to that. I just learned I can get tax help through my employer so I will go that route too because I don't know how much information I feel comfortable putting on reddit. :) 




 Oh, okay. Thanks for explaining. 




 I have more student loan interest this year, because I just rehabilitated them (yay for me!). I haven't finished filing yet, but I did not pick dependent. 




 What else do you need? I'm new at this. 




 I have excellent health insurance provided by my employer, which I pay a small amount for each month. Does that cover me? 




 That's a good suggestion. I'll try that when I get home! 




 Credit! I'm sorry. That's my bad. My only CREDIT was student loan interest. I did take the standard deduction. 




 Background: I make less than 25K, single lady with no kids. I am not in school, I work full time for a public university. GREAT benefits. 

I owe $470 on my tax return. This is a substantial amount of money for me, and it's going to decimate the small savings I have managed to put by. Last year, I got a small refund. My income and withholding, as stated, has not changed. I'm confused and sad. :( 

I just put everything through a Federal Free Edition on Turbotax, and my only credit was for Student Loan Interest. 

TLDR: ELI5 why it's different so I don't get pissy and mail off a bunch of pennies. Please and thank you. 3

Edit- Changed deduction to credit 




 You have to cancel these at least 24-48 hours in advance, so maybe someone is sitting on a reservation until it gets closer and they have to really decide which they want. Keep trying! I was able to make one last week for breakfast on May 6 so it could definitely happen! Keep trying and May the Force Be With You. 




 I like this idea.

 All of them. You can get GBA ones and play those on the Lite. Start with Fire Red or Leaf Green.
 




 Thanks for the tip. I think that's what we have decided to do. Better safe than sorry! 




 I appreciate the tip! :) 




 Awesome!! I didn't know you could try more than one thing. :D 

It is a little pricey, but I keep telling myself how many awesome benefits there are to it. :3 

How was the food? 




 Awesome, thanks. We really just wanted to bring the hilts to wear around, since our blades don't collapse. That's an awesome story about the sonic screwdriver! :D 




 That's awesome to hear to hear! I've never done a character meal before, but we are so looking forward to it! Thanks! :) 




 Does anyone know if there is a policy on this? My boyfriend and I are going in May (and we have the Star Wars Character breakfast reserved!) and we were wondering if we could wear our sabers. Thanks! :D

They are high quality dueling sabers, but we would leave the blades in the hotel of course!! 




 So if we booked yesterday, the price shouldn't change, right? First time bookers here, Thanks! 




 Thanks I managed to arrange something and will use that next time :) 




 Hey guys, I have an extra samurai from set 13 that I'd really love to trade for the fencer. Please let me knew if anyone would like to do this trade! :) Thanks!

 I think it has more to do with certain State fans thinking their football program was better because it jumped to FBS after one season. We never played each other until 2014 and apparently that made us Eagles look like we were 'scared.'

This was then further exacerbated by clueless announcers calling Georgia Southern Georgia State on multiple occasions. [Friendly PSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=putYM15zC0Y) 




 Disney has shown the Boba Fett portion of the Holiday Special at special character dining events at WDW. Stranger things have happened.

 KICK TO WIN 




 Yeah, kickers are not usually sought after recruits with a tight scholarship budget. Fritz knew what we needed though. 




 I dont know if there will be a ramp-up to buying for Star Wars,' Iger said, with most merchandise tied to a film typically selling around its release.

LOL that's not how Star Wars works Bob. If you sell it, they will buy. 




 I'm excited. We have had a few seasons now where the kicking has not been stellar. I'm talking about regular missed PAT. 




 Hail Southern! We can kick football now! :D 









 Good to know, thanks. 




 I am going to try at Midnight EST, fwiw. 




 I already have an alarm set to remind me to try for lunch reservations for my trip. *fingers crossed* 




 The boat rides were my favorite part. Also the cute cute architecture! I also enjoyed how the bus stop was nice and shady. The Gurgling Suitcase bar was also very fun! 




 Adorable! 




 They look like tsum tsums! :D 




 Mine's 500, just like the student card I screwed everything up with. It's my second card ever, so that probably has something to do with it. 




 Capital One has some cards for rebuilding. My SO is helping me rebuild for the same reason. I got one (with a tiny limit) immediately approved from Capital One so now I can start on the right path. Good luck!

I also bank with Capital One 360, so this may have helped me out. YMMV 




 Well there goes that career plan, guess I'll just continue to focus on my PhD then. :o

 Do you think I am defending her or something? I am confused as to why you are taking this so personally. 




 Thank you for dramatically correcting my opinion of a person neither of us know anything significant about beyond OP's post. I really appreciate your guidance. 




 No, but that's where it began. She found out something she didn't like about her boyfriend and let it fester until she did something drastic instead of talking to him about it and letting him know how she felt and also trying to see his side of things. I agree that it is a selfish way to be. 




 Coming from a chick here- She's overreacting and does not know how to communicate about what bothers her on an adult level.

Sure it hurts you now and don't let anyone tell you it shouldn't because that's an important part of the healing process. But you will be much happier being with someone who respects you more than that. 




 Good advice. I definitely think the breakfast will be one of the highlights of our trip. Getting the TS Fastpass sounds like the safe option! Thank you! 




 I'm sorry to hear that! I think I have been convinced to get the TS FP! 




 Thank you! Y'all have convinced me! 




 I really appreciate your in-depth reply. I would be more upset missing TS than RnRC, not sure how my SO feels though. It sounds like I should stick with Toy Story! :) Thanks! 




 Hello friends. I am trying to determine if I am making a HUGE mistake. I think I have decided to risk NOT FP+ing Toy Story Midway Mania. I know, I know! Let me explain.

We have an 8:25 AM Galactic Dine In Star Wars Breakfast Reservation at the Sci Fi Dine In Restaurant for May 6. The park opens at 9. Since I can either FP+ Toy Story or the Rockin Roller Coaster, I think I am going to chance it and take the Roller Coaster since we are so close to Toy Story in the park. I don't want to rush through the breakfast either though so I guess my question is, how soon after 9 AM does the line become unbearable for Toy Story? I have done it before, and it was WONDERFUL and my SO has never done it (and I know he would love it). 

What do you think? Thanks in advance and may the force be with you! 




 You can team up with a partner on Star Wars: The Old Republic. My boyfriend and I are paired up and playing through the Knight/Consular story lines together. It's awesome and you get two story lines at the same time. We also have a Bounty Hunter/Imperial Spy game going. 




 If your party likes movies/Star Wars/Pixar/Muppets then HS. Epcot for international flair! Shopping, food, and awesome fireworks.  




 Thanks! 




 Crossing my fingers for May... 




 Etsy is great too. I just got a set of Chewbacca ears there. Find a seller who makes ones you like, then ask if they will do a custom order. 




 The only special thing is that HS has tiers for their fast passes, so you can only make reservations for one A ride and 2 B rides. 

Toy Story Mania and Rockin Roller Coaster are both A.  




 Sorry to hijack but do you know when Pirates will be down? Thanks. :( 




 That's pretty much how Teavana makes their money.
 




 The first time I saw it it started just as we were getting to MK from Epcot after watching Illuminations and we saw part from the Monorail and that was awesome! We watched the rest from the plaza near the ticket center. 




 Or crepes... 
























 I always thought this was why guys pissed standing up. 




 I just got a new windows machine (Dell XPS 13 '15 edition) and I LOVE the snapping feature.

Prior, my primary machine was a 27 inch iMac, so never really hurt for screen space hehe. 




 An app would be awesome.

Besides that, I stopped playing in Nov. 2012 and only just picked it back up this month. NOTHING HAS CHANGED. Even the popular NC items are the same.  




 Yeah, but I think it's more socially acceptable for us ladies to tell people to stuff it for commenting about what we like. 




 Yep yep yep 10000x yep.

This is my biggest grammar pet peeve, because I feel like when people use 'I' when they should use 'me,' they are incorrectly patting themselves on the back for 'remembering the rule.'

 The one wearing shorts must start the conversation and wax poetic at length about the awesomeness of shorts. 




 There's speculation elsewhere in the thread that may answer your question. 




 Ambiguous 'natural' flavors in some flavored teas. 




 That was Arvel Crynyd. The female A-Wing pilot who was redubbed was Sila Kott. It's an easy mistake though because they look similar in their gear. 




 [Yeah she was awesome.](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Dine_Ellberger) 




 An excellent point! 




 Porkins bein porkins. 




 AND the guy who gets Indy to go find the Ark of the Covenant. Dude gets around. 




 In the Outer Rim, I'd rather be dead than maimed to be honest lol. 




 Natural flavorings can still be ambiguous. There's a natural flavoring in one of their raspberry herbals that doesn't agree with me that in no way comes from a raspberry. That said, Adagio is my preferred tea retailer! 




 I'm not sure. There is one reference to a female pod racer by Anakin in an EU novel, but it's to describe how horrifically she died.  




 Nope. None whatsoever. :( 




 [She was. Then overdubbed with a male voice](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sila_Kott)
 




 I have never had a problem with Adagio and their customer service is quite good. I think they use less artificial flavors than Teavana, although they are not completely 'clean.' 




 So useful. Go for it. 




 There were some in the Battle for Naboo! :) 




 The comments in that article make me a sad panda. [Also](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sila_Kott) 









 Thank you. 




 "It is very likely that at least some degree of Ebola virus transmission currently occurs via infectious aerosols generated from the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract, or medical procedures, although this has been difficult to definitively demonstrate or rule out, since those exposed to infectious aerosols also are most likely to be in close proximity to, and in direct contact with, an infected case,"

Yep so people will be fear mongering with this even though the scientists admitted it was impossible to control for.

Also

Thursday's study examines the idea that minuscule droplets of body fluid containing the virus could hang in the air and be inhaled by others, providing an unrecognized, if minor, pathway for the virus.

Not the same thing as an Ebola mutated to be airborne! 




 If you read the books, you learn that Picard is fairly unpopular with the brass and that it has a lot to do with the time he spent as a Borg.

 Archaholic alkeyologists 




 In my experience, I have observed that we get a lot of questions about what it is like to be an archaeologist. Which tells me that like most scientists, we are not so great at communicating what it is we do exactly with the general public.

As a general rule, archaeology is not sexy and I have never seen it portrayed accurately in a film for this reason. For something closer to accurate, think "Scrubs" except with shovels. Most archaeologists work project to project, usually on something related to infrastructure. These projects are conducted in advance of construction projects making use of federal funds. Very rarely does anyone go looking for something in particular (because of confirmation bias for one thing) because archaeology is EXPENSIVE when you do it right, which includes proper excavation and reporting techniques. There is no quick way to earn respect but shitty excavation practices and bad ethics is a hell of a way to lose it.

I'm fortunate enough to be salaried at a major American university, but that also means I no longer do much digging. My main focus is on public education. 

Best of luck with your project!

Also, we as a whole have zero fashion sense. Jeans, a button down and boots with most of the dirt knocked off is professional attire. I love it. 




 Your home scale might not be calibrated the same as the one at the doctor. If your clothes feel the same you did not gain ten pounds.
 




 This is my favorite picture of her :) 









 42 hours last week, 38 hours this week. It works out, but it's shifty. 




 No worries. I'm an archaeologist and I understand taking a shit job early career on the other side of the country to get your foot in the door. Best of luck. 




 I really like Atlanta. The area around GaTech is pretty cool and they have a lot of music festivals in the area. Some great museums as well. Can't comment on the dating scene though. Oh and the bars in Buckhead are EXPENSIVE.
 




 Are you an archaeologist? 




 Ultrasaber makes the one he got me. It's Obi-Wan's hilt with an LED you can change to be any color you want.
