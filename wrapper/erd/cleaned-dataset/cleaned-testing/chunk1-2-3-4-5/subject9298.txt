 I don't understand why so many women feel like they need to make a baby. Everyone wants to experience pregnancy. 
Why the fuck would you want to go through that kind of pain? Stretch marks, weight gain, all kinds of complications during the pregnancy, and then of course, labour. Not to mention, raising a newborn is a pain in the ass. 
Yeah, I'd rather adopt.
For me at least, I really couldn't care less if my child looks like me or not. I feel like a much better person knowing that I'm going to hopefully be giving some child's a better life rather than making another useless human to take up more space. 
























 My grandpas both died before I was born, but my little brother talks about them all the time. Apparently, he goes to his grandpas house and does all kinds of cools things, and sometimes he cries because he misses his grandpa. 
























 Lots to do. Can't do it.

 Sometimes I sit down and re-watch a few episodes of Avatar: The Last Air Bender, just to feel nostalgic.
