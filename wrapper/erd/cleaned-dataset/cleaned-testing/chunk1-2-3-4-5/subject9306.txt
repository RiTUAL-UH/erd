 Anal sex with a virgin girl and a guy with an above-average penis size cannot end well.  




 Do you have a source for the size of Philadelphia? Surely there were larger Indian or Chinese cities.  




 But surely the people causing the conditions leading to the Serbians feeling the need to revolt were at fault? 




 Aren't all wars a competition of imperial powers masquerading as good vs evil? 




 I think you're a) onto a winner of a girl and b) going to need to take it slow. She's been hurt badly before, wants to trust you, but can't - YET. Also, I know from personal experience that depression will only magnify this, and she will perceive all of these problems as being her fault. All you can do is not pressure her but continue to be loving and caring, and she will do the rest in time. 

To use a convenient metaphor from your own story, you need to slowly lead her into the water and carefully help her relearn to swim, despite her fear and apprehension.  




 I'm pretty sure you do share that opinion with everyone.  




 I hate to break it to you, bro, but that kind of attitude is exactly what women (or anyone) finds LEAST attractive. Comparatively, no one gives a fuck if you're ugly/hot smart/dumb so on and so forth, and they'll put up with a bit of self depreciation and lack of self esteem, but when you've let it turn into (what comes across as) bitterness and anger at everything around you that you perceive as better than you, NO ONE will want to spend time with you in any capacity. You have to force yourself to believe in yourself - not even that you're the best or the most outstanding at something, but at least that you're AS GOOD AS EVERYBODY ELSE.

For example, you mentioned that there's a chick who swam across Lake Ontario. So you're not capable of doing that. Well, neither am I. Neither are 6.9 BILLION of the other people in the world. Neither is the guy above me who is a QUALIFIED OLYMPIC SWIMMER. But I can guarantee you're better at swimming across that lake than 1 billion (yes, one billion) people in the world. Chances are you're still better than 3 billion people.

The other thing you need to remind yourself is that depression and low self-esteem is the easy way out. By telling yourself that you suck and that you can't even try, you ARE worse than everybody else at the one thing we all compete in - LIFE. Life itself. It's a race to the finish line, and you're walking dejectedly in the opposite direction. By turning that around and bring determined to win life, you are instantly superior to everybody in the skill that matters more than anything. 

And it'll make you sexy. 

Source: low self esteem, clinical depression, and discovering the hard way that - despite how hard my friends try, and despite anything that anyone ever does - the only person who will get change any of that is ME. 

EDIT: And dude, linking me to an entire thread of people who have completely changed their lives with a bit of exercise and fashion sense, and telling me you're still ugly, is like beating me around the face with the solutions to all of your problems while saying a solution doesn't exist. Seriously. Just go read what you just freaking showed me.  




 Props for putting the TL;DR at the top. I can't understand why one would have to read everything else before finding it.  




 Sounds like the witch hunt seen in Monty Python/Holy Grail.  




 The fact that he had to withdraw a further $300 to cover his actions probably didn't help this.  




 To be fair, the same goes for women not being men without penises. 




 TIL there's a Taken 2 




 This is the appropriate response to a good 50% of /r/datingadvice.  




 Go find a girl, any girl, preferably a hot one. Look at her. Realise the fact that she - it - is nothing but a squishy bag of water and organs. This bag of meat moves around and noises come out of its mouth. Random impulses of electricity cause this to happen. This object is nothing more, and nothing less, than a sack of fluids and bones. 

Look at anyone like that for even a moment and they will never intimidate you again.  




 It sounds like you're doing pretty well, and that you just needed to egg it out and have some people reassure you (and there's nothing wrong with that).

Stay strong! 




 Exactly my point.  




 This is one of those things that you really want to read, but really really shouldn't, because it sends you right back to square one.

And so we come to love the damage we do to ourselves with the absence of that other person, cling to it as much as we clung to them, and use loneliness itself to get through the day.

Thank god I deleted her phone number, because I don't think I'd be able to restrain myself at the moment otherwise.

EDIT: Also, if you're a deviantart person, I highly suggest you submit this. It was beautiful. 




 Classical music is hardly music for the masses either. 




 At my uni's music program I find it completely the opposite - classical musicians are superior, and god help you if you're playing Jazz Bazz. Snobbery everywhere.

Of course, I'm just a lowly Musical Theatre actor (incidentally by far the most competitive course to get into) so I get it from all sides. 




 I like to say "tell me the most awesome thing about yourself." Shows I'm interested in her, usually reveals something they're passionate about, and boosts their self esteem by allowing them to brag for a second. Also, if they come out with something shallow or stupid without thinking about their answer at all, it shows that they probably have very little maturity or self-introspection, and I know that they wouldn't be well suited to me. 




 Tbh it sounds like there's a problem with her, not you, that she doesn't want to tell you. Especially if she contacted you later to make you not feel bad - if you'd pissed her off she wouldn't give a fuck.

Has she broken up with anyone recently, and can't relate to a new guy yet? A self esteem issue where she feels like she doesn't deserve you? (Unlikely I know, but I've seen a girl with depression remain convinced that no one could ever love her even after being asked out by a guy) 




 Too put it nicely, /r/seduction (not /r/seddit, which is the same with just 300 subs) is... geared towards sex and nothing else. It also encourages people to look at the opposite sex as an opportunity and target of manipulation, not a person with emotions.

In short, it's not for everybody. 




 As fun as these threads are to read, they're all essentially pointless - you could wear a little pink tutu and still be sexy if you're attractive, and if you're not, even a $40 000 suit won't save you.

Rule 1: Be attractive. Rule 2: Don't be unattractive. 




 Girls don't emotionally mature faster. They're just as fucking stupid at 17, they just don't display it in the 'let's do stuff that might get us killed' way. 




 Majority of SOCIAL risks. Girls do have pregnancy. But I agree with you. 




 If it gets buried then no one is going to see or read it anyway. So why point it out? 




 Firstly, I suggest you xpost to /r/singing. They get these kind of requests on a daily basis.

Also, your audition song doesn't have to be about the same thing as the show - especially with a character this specific. If it's a funny show, go a character song. If it's more serious, likewise.

For your range (which I suggest you edit into the original post, along with your age), I suggest [I'm Not That Smart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M93eivYXr4) from The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee  as a lighthearted character song, and [Valjean's Soliloquy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GrJeP9FKN0) as a more serious alternative. 




 He's saying your penis is 5'3". 




 Surely if she's mentally unstable, something would have happened like this before? That's a long time! 




 It ripped the arms off a droid? What a woman. 




 Dammit Jesus, you fuck everything up. 




 /r/depression. They are friendly people going through the same thing as you, and I find they can help a lot. 




 When you need to make a decision with a group, and everyone's doing the 'I don't mind, you pick' thing (such as where shall we get dinner etc.), don't be all considerate and ask them what they want to do. Make a decision right there and then, and stick to it. Major confidence points. 




 I hope the pizza man delivered.  




 That's absolutely awful. I'm sorry you had to go through that. If you ever need someone to talk to, please PM me. 




 I think overall he means the same as you - to own yourself, everything about you, and any situation you might be in.  




 So basically - be attractive and confident, and don't complain when a girl who you have displayed neither to isn't interested, just because you're 'nice'? 




 The teacher too has acted inappropriately and unprofessionally. Is there a higher authority you can go to? 




 That's completely out of line. You should have told him to fuck off in no uncertain terms. It's sexual assault, ANYONE would be uncomfortable with that.  




 Well, this is r/sex. 




 Fascist clues?! 




 Musos can be very huggy. You might want to be careful there.  




 Swimsuit? Where are you waking up, in a creek? 




 Similar situation and similar end result, except I only realized the change in myself a few days ago. Great relationship with an amazing and unique person, brutal breakup, depression and the ability to talk to any girl because what the hell, they're not HER, they will never be as good as her.

Finally get over her - now I have the confidence and communication skills without the baggage. 




 Presumably somewhere where people don't talk to them much. 




 Exactly.  




 As someone who is in their first year of college, and had exactly the same situation as you in high school - IT GETS SO MUCH FUCKING BETTER. 




 This is going to sound terribly specific, but I suggest you try to get into some Music/Performing Arts circles. All of my best friends are musicians, and (with obvious exceptions) they are the kindest, most generous, most fun and by far the most outgoing people you will ever meet. They make friends very quickly and easily, and never have too many, so you'll be welcomed into a group within minutes.

While these types of people obviously are not perfect (can be very egotistical, competitive, and bitchy if you get on their bad side, eccentric as hell), they seem to me to be the best option for getting out of the situation you're in quickly. Giving up on my more conventional 'friends' and increasing my socializing with these guys single-handedly solved my loneliness, found all of my best friends and my first (  subsequent) girlfriend(s), and gave me plenty of things to get out and do/see.

So maybe join a local community choir or theatre company. Join a band/orchestra if you can play an instrument. Trust me, good times will be had. 




 So why comment? 




 When you've told him subtly you don't want him arond, and he asks why, you need to tell him EXACTLY why. Meaning he's being creepy and overly attached.

It's part of the 'nice guy' phenonemon - there's a great thread about it over [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/lncn2/compiled_a_kill_nice_guy_with_fire_guide_for_men/) - wherein he just does not understand all of the social signals you have sent him to say back off. You have no other option but to tell him in no uncertain terms he's not wanted. He be a bit unhappy, but he will learn from the experience and do much better with interpersonal interactions in the future.

If you aren't brutally honest about what he's doing wrong, he'll be one of the sorry creatures that rants about how they are in the 'friendzone' and 'she keeps going out with guys who aren't as nice and dedicated as I am,' etc etc. You can save him the long term agony now with one frank conversation. 




 The fact that you're being so aggressive in return, when she has clearly stated she was just trying to be helpful, is far worse. 




 I think the only place they don't have them is above the tree line on our biggest mountains in snow season. Even then, I'd take precautions. 




 Brisbane and 18 here, I assume you guys have Coffee Club? Fairly classy, waited tables, decent food, but still pretty chilled. Usually in central locations. I take people there all the time. 




 Can I suggest you crosspost this to /r/relationship_advice or something similar? You hardly need help seducing her, which is what this subreddit is really for. Also, edit out most of the sex, they won't be interested unless it's r/gonewildstories.

As far as suggestions, I'd say that 7 months is plenty of time to have a lot of fun. Tell her you want to be casual, that she can take her time and make up her own mind about whether she trusts you once she knows you better. Don't push her, just enjoy her company. 




 So give everyone money? 




 Add this to "I don't think I'm ever going to find someone better" 




 Hopefully they'll have kids. Then there will be. 




 To be fair, though, clothes are designed to accent the body of the person wearing them. They don't do the seducing all by themselves. 




 So do guys.  




 If only we ever got off reddit and went outside... 




 It was probably diagnosed and/or medicated. 




 Because of the twist ending I didn't realise he didn't actually write that for a while. 




 Lawyered 




 I'm expecting a full Harvard bibliographical reference directly under the tattoo. 




 Gonna rock some Jane Austen/Anna Karenina. 




 The irony is that you need more full stops because you have too many. 




 A common theme seems to be books - what kind of books? I have shitloads and there's no way I can get them all in my room at once.  
























 The whole concept of a neg doesn't fucking work. If someone told me I was ugly, would you seriously expect me to start taking off my clothes and exposing myself? No, I'd run and hide and never have sex again.  




 I think there are a huge number of men who are attracted to shy women.  




 Would people in this thread like to answer their own questions? It could make things quite interesting. 




 "What are the signs that a girl likes a guy?"

Bi-weekly at least. 




 Can we sidebar something like this? I see these threads at least once a week, from both genders in both subreddits, and the answers are always the same - followed by 'just go for it and ask him/her already.' 




 Can someone translate this please? 




 I tend to find that the 'spark' doesn't appear until you are comfortable with the person - particularly when you're actually going out. If you asked him out (I assume he'll say yes) and both of you relax, you will have a lot more fun together. The awkwardness will disappear when he doesn't feel he constantly has to impress you (which he does if he likes you).

Also, the 'chemistry' mentioned in movies can be exaggerated, and is better labelled as 'having fun in their company.' Expecting some strange and magical feeling of love at first sight to suddenly strike you down is quite simply not going to happen. 




 Maybe he's one of the 64 




 bend over backwards for them

Well there's your problem. Sorry mate, but you're about to hear some harsh truths. 

You're a *nice guy* - otherwise referred to as the most unattractive object in the world. Sorry. There's an excellent guide to helping you in r/askwomen or something, and I'll link you to it when I'm not on my phone, unless somebody helpful will do it for me. 

Basically you're coming across totally wrong - in your desire to not be a loser, you're making yourself even more so. Rather than conveying 'a sensitive, caring guy who just wants love,' you're putting across 'needy, possibly obsessive, and high maintenance with very low self-esteem.'

they say I'll find somebody

Can you please elaborate more on the conversation leading up to this? It will help us dissect what you're saying wrong. 

I have no doubt that you're a great guy with a lot to offer a girl - and you *need* to believe this too - but the way you're conveying yourself is unfortunately of a weak, needy... loser.  




 I would hope so, seeing as they're married.  




 /r/malefashionadvice 




 - Rob Thomas 




 The fuck? Since when was violin less cool than flute? And I'm pretty sure even professional musicians who are male flautists still get ridiculed. 

I played Trombone in high school. If I hadn't also been able to sing my dorkness would have been over 9000.  




 Well, the person who stole it does.  




 If you want him, you need to put in some effort and step outside your comfort zone. It's as simple as that.  




 r/seduction would have an apoplexy if the guy gave a girl his number. But I think it builds a bit of trust and makes you look less like yore just trying to get in her pants. Opinions, anybody? 




 There's such an emphasis on males upholding this side of a relationship - he must always tell you you're beautiful, that you look nice, etc. etc. or he's not worth being with - but it never goes both ways. 




 Well laaa di dah  




 Or that something has gone wrong.  




 Dolce et decorum est 




 I don't think there should be conscription for anyone, but I think we can have gender equality long before we have world peace, so I'm working on achievable goals.  




 I didn't say I was *right*. 




 While I am all for feminism, this has always irritated me. You can't seriously expect women to have an equal place to men in society when we can be forced to kill and to die, and you can't.  




 So by that maths, Afghanistan has -1 health care systems? 




 I'm a historian, and I don't agree.  




 If you did the cover a long time ago, how can you be a new player/singer? 




 I suppose at 18 I'm not really old enough to say 'I know how you feel,' but I'm going to anyway.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I always try to be outgoing, happy and fun, I have numerous friends (mostly female, in fact) in several circles who think I'm funny and good company, I go well out of my way to ensure people around me are happy. I dress as well as I can afford (thank you MFA), I always try to be polite, and I don't think I'm stupid. I'm a paid, professional singer, and I can play guitar. I have no problems approaching girls and talking to them, and I don't think I'm boring - even so, I've studied r/socialskills intently. Sounds good on paper, right?

Wrong. 

I have always been the third wheel, for my entire life. I had one girlfriend for two months, who seriously fucked me over emotionally and then cheated on me with some sixteen year old cunt. My friends and hers (who are no longer her friends) all agree that I did everything perfectly - was understanding, supportive, romantic; in one girl's words "the perfect boyfriend." Besides her, not a single girl has ever shown interest in me, and whenever I try to initiate - which I do on a DAILY basis - they always make it more than clear that they're not interested. I've joined clubs and pursued hobbies, I've taken ballroom dancing classes, am involved in more musical ensembles than is healthy for my sanity. I go out drinking/dancing/clubbing; every person in the group will hook up with someone - except me. It doesn't matter. I meet so many people, and I'm friends with most of them almost instantly, but NONE of them ever display any interest in me beyond that. 

I've concluded that I'm ugly, which makes me a little sad, because there's nothing I can do about it (besides plastic surgery - fuck that shit), so I'm stuck being lonely for the rest of my life. 

P.S. I don't whinge about the 'friendzone' because that attitude is pathetic, but when a girl you really like refers to you as her Gay Best Friend it stings.  




 Am I the only person in the world that finds something to talk about, and doesn't just say 'hey'? 




 Quiet... drama girl? Quiet drama people exist? 




 Or where he fits in Kara! 




 SIMBA 




 Don't feel like you should *have* to kiss etc, as if it's not a real relationship without it. If you're comfortable just being with each other, so much the better.  




 Being in a relationship is just like being really good friends, but with sex. If you're not having sex yet (totally understandable at her age, and it's important not to pressure her) then you don't even need to worry about that. Hang out, go to movies and shit, do whatever you would normally with other friends. Don't have sexual contact with anyone besides her. There is an implicit emotional connection; you will probably be her go-to person for emotional support, and likewise. 

The bottom line: have fun. It should be about opportunities, not duties.  




 Shirts three sizes too big on girls are EXTREMELY flattering.  




 Wait, so the baby had down's syndrome, was fathered by an ex boyfriend, who was the daddy?

Or the girl had down's syndrome and her dad, who was not only her ex but also a baby, was wailing in the car? 




 Dude. She's talking about sex stories with you. Clear sign that (to quote Superbad) she wants your dick, in and around her mouth. 

All you have to do now is make a move and go get some! 




 If you approach him, it will make his day. His week. His life. 

He's probably beating himself up about not having the confidence to approach you, but if you give him a lead in he'll most likely gain a ton of it. And it'll put a smile on his face for a month. 

EDIT: if what you're saying about the looking and looking away is true, then he likes you. No doubt. This is a classic for shy guys.  




 Can I ask why he is being downvoted? I make these kind of jokes all the time - especially when girls are talking about girl things, like waxing their legs etc - and they're great for a quick laugh.

And the bottom line of social skills is that once you've shared a joke with someone your relationship with them will never be the same. It's the oldest form of connection (besides probably sex) in human history.  




 By 'went back to his place' I'm assuming you mean you slept with him - in which case, if he doesn't contact you and does a hit  amp; quit, then he's a dickhead and not worth being with anyway. If he's not, he will!

EDIT: I have absolutely no problems with her sleeping with anyone, it just affects the situation.  




 I think she's using 'stalk' lightheartedly. I certainly do when talking about Facebook, and I hear it constantly from other people.  




 With notable exceptions on both sides, I find particularly attractive people to be less giving in all walks of life. Not that they're unkind, but less attractive people are more likely to go well out of their way for other people, because unfortunately they have to.  




 I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU ARE OR WHAT YOU'RE DOING. SIT THE FUCK DOWN AND WRITE PART 2. NOW.

AND PART 3, AND PART 4, AND PART 5. 




 You said that everybody has left and there is nobody in your town like you - this is a bit of a defeatist attitude and not be done lightly, but have you considered leaving too?

EDIT: As an artsy person who found great happiness in the big smoke 




 I really loved this comment, but how does it relate to kissing? 




 I've need seen it used in a sentence, so perhaps the Supine is just the 'dictionary' form of the Participle? 




 What if another rocket fails and they don't want us to know? 




 I'm currently doing Latin at University, and we learned (just last week actually) that the Participle is derived from the Supine form, but the Supine is still used as the Principal Part. That's from the Cambridge Latin textbook.  




 That's the next line of the song.  




 Coz papa's gonna be bringing' home the... gingerbread! 




 Latin verbs have four principle parts - the Present Indicative Active, Present Infinitive, Perfect Indicative Active, and Supine. 

I can see how this relates to English, but I've never heard our words organized in this way. Is it used in teaching the language? 




 I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with the term 'Venetian Blonde.' This may because Venice is on the other side of the world from Australia.  




 Can you imagine the world before that song? CHAOS.  




 Aussies unite. Our chicks are by far the best. 

Which is my excuse for why I still miss her.  




 Gingers are orange.  




 Yeah the PM gives them all a bad name 




 ... the pub? 




 
Running their fingers through my ginger beard? 




 As someone who is familiar with Principal Parts in other languages but not English, can you please explain how they function in this language? I am fascinated. I didn't know we had them.  




 Yeah, this thread was not a good move.  




 I waltz over and talk to girls all the time, and they do think it's weird. They think I'm eccentric as hell. Which is probably true. 

But they also think I'm fun, outgoing, and confident - which equals attractive.  




 We are making some progress. 

I said a bang, bang, bangity bang, I said a bang bang bangity bang.  




 I can only assume this is what they did. 




 Getting called gay when you're clearly not is a compliment? ... this changes everything.  




 To be fair, Romans were always in sex mode. 

One of the duties of the Censors (an elected position) was to prevent celibacy. Yes, conservative Christians and Texan sexual educators, you heard that right. PREVENT.  




 I would like to point out that not all guys find confidence attractive. It doesn't change a single thing for me, and I would almost prefer a quiet shy girl (albeit one who is still attractive) to an overtly confident girl.  




 Yes, bikinis are major factor. But the whole salty hair, warm   tanned skin, and general fun atmosphere of the beach makes it a particularly sexy place.  




 Here's the secret: you actually look really sexy at the beach, just in a totally different way.  
























 Is it just me or does tiled floor + socks + chasing cat seem like a bad idea? 




 Elaborate? 




 Please enlighten me on the correct wording of the joke as it would please you. 

And I live with several engineering students, all of whom never shut up about it.  




 Yeah, of course it's in the USA.  




 How do you know someone is an engineer?

They'll tell you.  




 So really you're not like any of them.  




 The accident being that western society developed in the way that you described, and not in some other way.  




 No. INDIVIDUALS run the world. The fact that most of these happen to be men is an accident of western history. There are just as many men who need help for various things as women.  




 I've been told in the past that being called cute is actually a bad thing - it means you're passable but don't have the confidence that women find truly attractive to be 'hot/sexy.' Any women care to clarify? 




 Dude. Normal-shaped girl with just a leeeetle bit of belly = HOT. So much more than a flat stomach.  




 Amazon's amazing for posters. I got some massive and good quality musical theatre posters for like $7 (AUD) each.  




 I think it's supposed to be 'barefooted,' but people have a habit of dropping past tenses when they talk about concepts. 

r/linguistics can probably explain these things with much more accuracy.  




 That's a harsh school if you got in trouble for being 37 seconds late.  




 How exactly did that happen? Did she force you to have vaginal sex with her? 




 Apparently sounding intelligent is very attractive. You should keep doing whatever you were doing.  




 That's absolutely awful. But since you mentioned the babysitter was female, what is your gender? 




 Like any scientific study, regardless of the language used to describe it.  




 Neither of those were really directed at you - the first obviously because you're not hideous and gross. The second means that the man in question is backing off and not displaying his (still ever-present) interest because he is getting none from the girl in return. Most guys are interested in all females they know (that meet the attractiveness of point one) all the time, and are simply hedging their bets by showing only their interest in those who respond the most. There is no 'friend zone' or non-attractiveness-related reasons for lack of interest, as there often is from the female perspective. As you're displaying a lot of interest (I certainly hope you are) you don't have this problem.  




 There's really no such thing as a male initiated friendzone. It's either a) I don't want to bang her because she's unattractive or b) she displays little interest in banging me right now, so I'm shelving the project until further budget of interest is acquired.  




 I'm agreeing with now that you've specified your answer to mean in the realms of sexuality and attractiveness. Your first was a little too broad - and, honestly, came off as very sexist - which is why I think people were offended.  




 Well laa di daah 




 It is so much vastly easier for women to be attractive than men.  




 Please elaborate on how this could be possible? 




 most men do a better job with children

Can you elaborate on this for my curiosity please? 




 That being said, don't let sex become your only goal - regardless of your morality, I've seen plenty of advice on here that aiming for sex alone in a night (and not just to have fun) will ruin your game long-term 




 Which means the only direction is up.  




 TEN POINTS FROM GRYFFINDOR 




 As Achilles, I can confirm this. 




 Implying sex is the only goal and the only worthy conclusion 




 Or unless laws make the risk outweigh the reward.  




 Which would be like teaching that green shells are the only shells, and scientists developing blue shells are demons trying to corrupt you.  




 In all seriousness, who has such self confidence that they don't compare themselves to anyone else, or are ever jealous of somebody's looks or abilities? It's not possible, and a little bit of self introspection and humility can be healthy.  




 Four of my five roommates happen to be female with boyfriends, and the one dude is out right now. So I'm no sure that would go down too well. But thanks for the suggestion.  




 I'm naked right now, so thank you 




 Some places have preschool before kindergarten.  




 No, you were already downvoted.  




 He's just jealous because he's a 13 year old that won't have sex for a loooong time.  




 By the number of perfectly acceptable posts I saw on 0 at the bottom of the thread, I'm guessing some prudish prick is downvoting everything involving underage sex.  




 Wait wait wait... you say you were a *virgin* the first time you had sex? Wtf? 




 I hate to sound like Skittles11, but could you elaborate on how oral sex happened at 7?! 




 I'm gonna go ahead and guess that happens because it's funny.  




 Does this extent to all substantial facial hair, or just the bushy variety? 




 Shy people and introverts don't 'hate' people. They occasionally need some space, and don't like loud, hyper-social environments. 

This does not mean that they are sociopaths.  




 That is the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard. 

Please, do explain how do you came to this conclusion.  




 Are you saying that shy people are mentally unstable? 




 I saved the comment, just so I never forget 




 Thank you! 




 Like you? 




 And you're really fixing that with your mature and constructive response.  




 Confident people can have self-doubt. Self-introspection is often the difference between confidence and arrogance.  




 I'm going to dispute you on unattractive girls being able to win men with confidence. I personally don't find confidence as a positive or a negative, and I know plenty of men who prefer shy girls. I would have no problems 'finding a reason to say yes' to an unattractive girl who approached me.  




 Post-orgasm, after we've laid there and chilled for thirty seconds, I always flip her over and give her a back massage. She says it's incredible. I'm pretty sure she now has sex with me just for the backrub.  




 If he has that little confidence in himself, of course she's going to look for better options. It's just unattractive.  




 The guy just sounds jaded that he is no longer attractive or putting enough effort into a relationship to keep her attention. Not only is this his fault, but it also goes both ways - women should thus be equally worried about men using their smartphones to find better options. So, as always, what it comes down to is not becoming complacent and taking your significant other for granted. Regardless of whether it's the 2nd century or the 20th.

 Hah, GAAAAY 




 This is what I struggle with the most about r/seduction - the ideal presented, and what women seem to find attractive, is frankly repulsive to me. I actually want to be a nice guy. I want to help people. I want to be friends with them. I DON'T want to spend every second of my life being superior, or a 'leader,' or the most aggressive caveman. I sure as hell don't want to treat women like objects. 

I've spent a fair bit of time here trying to reconcile the two philosophies, without much success. If I remain celibate for life and not a repulsive douchebag, so be it.  




 After the open-ended question, ask more questions to uncover specific details. Then share something related about yourself/your viewpoint on the subject. Rinse and repeat. 

E.g: what did you do this weekend? I went skiing.
- I didn't know you like skiing. How long have you been doing that for?
- was it fun? Any exciting stories? (moderate effectiveness depending on what you're actually asking about)
-  where did you go? What was it like there?
- is skiing hard?

Then:

- the last time I went skiing, I nearly got eaten by a carp. Crazy, right?
- I've heard a lot about skiing but never tried it. What about it is so fun? (great question if the person is really passionate about the given topic)
- my wife loves skiing. You should go together sometime.
- have you tried (skiing place)?

These all vary according to your level of knowledge of the subject, but a good rule of thumb is that if you don't know what they're talking about, encourage them to explain and teach you. If you do, share expertise/viewpoints/stories etc. Learn further. Note that it is **very** important not to talk too much about your own perspectives, especially when talking about something like politics.  




 This is about as erotic as the American Idol auditions.

Which brings me nicely to **VIII**: Thou shalt critique the spelling of others in a 19th Century German Facist manner 




 Does she ignore you or not talk to you? The difference is very important. 

If you're trying to talk to her and she is being noncommittal, one word answers, trying to get away etc - ignoring you - then she is clearly not into you at all, and asking her out will only lead to great embarrassment. 

If she just doesn't come up and talk to you because you're not that good friends, or because she has higher priorities (other friends that you mentioned) then there's nothing wrong. She just doesn't know you well enough to have a reason to talk to you. While a lot of people are advocating to straight up ask her out, and this attitude is definitely what you need, I'd still advise testing the waters a little bit - find some reason to make conversation with her and see how she reacts (ask her to help you with some schoolwork etc). If she responds in a friendly manner - and not in the way I described in the first paragraph - all signals go. Balls to the wind, ask her out, and hopefully she says yes. 

If she politely turns you down, don't be offended. You're not right for each other and she knows it. The same applies for if she is properly ignoring you as above. If she rejects you nastily, then she's a Class A bitch that you definitely don't want to be with, and you've just dodged a bullet. 

Good luck! 
























 As a genuinely curious male who doesn't know: what are the struggles of females in the dating world? 




 Classic Schmosby 




 Only 9 hours? You didn't watch the extended edition. For shame.  




 While any situation like this can absolutely be regarded as rape, I would like to tentatively suggest that he may not have considered it a negative experience had she been very attractive. 




 I doubt it.  




 Every suggestion in this thread is absolutely valid, but I've always found the best cure is to find someone else to think about. Not necessarily go out with etc, though that's great for you if you're ready for it, but find someone else to occupy your mind, wish you were with , want to talk to and so on.  




 Go for it! :) 




 despite the fact that I usually dress very well

I'm going to be a little skeptical, because this can be subjective. Perhaps she meant dress a little more *convemtionally* well? 




 Tbh, the dating system is MUCH easier for women than for men.  




 I literally cannot ever scratch anything in my mother's presence, because it means I must be sick or having an allergic reaction to something somehow. Apparently people don't just get itchy sometimes.  




 I decided something had to be done when my self esteem was so low and I was so worried what everybody thought of me that I started having severe panic attacks in public.  




 I'd be happier for people to be here than to have no community at all. 




 Seven years? I find optimism helps. 




 Comments like this are what give this subreddit a reputation for being breakup trigger-happy. 




 Gorgeous! I know it's totally up to you and your goals, but based on how much your face has changed, I reckon you're fine where you are :) 




 I'm glad you're recovering - things *will* get better for you. PM me if you ever need to talk.  




 Mate, that's amazing progress! Congratulations, you should be really proud of yourself!

I'm doing ok. Starting losing some weight - only two kilos down, but that's not so bad, as I only want to lose about fifteen. I was actually feeling on the way up for the first time in years before I got diagnosed - like I'd started the medication before getting the illness.  




 Thanks, you too! 




 I'm glad you feel better, and I hope it stays that way! I know the parents are just worried, which is why I'm trying to put up with it as much as possible. It's just awkward because if there's any reason I'm like this in the first place, it's probably them.

With regards to therapy, I'm actually being taught medical hypnosis at the moment - which sounds whacked, but you do it to yourself, and it's basically a kind of meditation where you combat low self esteem by convincing yourself that you're actually worthwhile and things like that. So far it's working.  




 It will get better. Trust me. No matter what happens, you will get through these exams and shit and into a brighter place. PM me if you need to talk it out any more, any time. Really. 

And I hadn't intended it to be, but I love that band and I love that song! Cheers brother! 




 It took me a while to realize they don't want help, they want the emotional support to enable them to help themselves.  




 Exactly right. Even though I'm relatively new here (been lurking for a bit), I think this subbreddit would benefit from a mentality of being a team where we can beat our problems together - *more* than just a place where we can talk it out (though that's great too). 




 I'm glad you're out of the relationship, and I'm glad you're washing the memories away with something tasty. Though whether you feel fine in the morning is yet to be seen :P

PM me if you ever need to talk.  




 Cheers! Good luck to you bud :) 




 It's weird how you take a kind of perverse pleasure in being depressed. It's one of the reasons I took so long to get diagnosed - you feel like its one of the few things you really enjoy. 

But you'll get back on your feet, and enjoying things the conventional way. Feel free to PM me any time :) 




 I struggled for a long time with the possibility that I might just have a severe case of Whiny Little Bitch Disorder, so to know that I'm not just an attention whore is nice. 

It also took a *long* time and the constant encouraging of some very helpful friends to get me to therapy at all. I just didn't want to take a step forward (though I didn't see it like that at the time). So I guess I have achieved something.  




 I'm glad you're making progress! The only way is up!

Ironically, I've been diagnosed at a point when I also actually feel on the uphill at last, as opposed to the usual low point when people finally see a doctor. It's quite weird, having almost received the medication a few months before the illness.  




 It's absolutely not your fault. At all. 

What I'd meant was that I had unwittingly been an example of how men see an emotionally strong and confident male, and the benefit that such an attitude of emotional self-reliance brings them, and instantly try to emulate it - or believe that they are inferior for not being able to do so. It's a knee-jerk reaction to someone you perceive to be 'better' than you.  




 Bro, you're just at one those temporary low points that happen to everyone. The only way from here is up, and I'm sure you'll be right on top of it next week.  




 If he wants to fix things, it means he is concerned and he cares.  




 Actually, I would say shoulders first (if that) and waist a very close second. Compare the attractiveness of a man in a loose dress shirt and a slim fit dress shirt of the same size - equal shoulders, but one looks like a tent.  




 So basically, you want clothes that fit without actually changing what clothes you wear?

And it's male *fashion.* So it's going to be clothes that are fashionable. Like not tshirts.  




 How else is anyone supposed to address the gender as a whole? 

On that note, should we expect... that non-man gender to not use the word 'male?' 




 And this is precisely where the social pressure comes from. It's not your fault, but as soon as I read your comment I criticized myself for not having the moral strength and conviction that you do, and decided I should try to be more like it in the future, before realising I was perpetuating the stereotype.  




 What girls say they want a man to do with his emotions and what they *actually* want are two very different things. 

They want a man to open up about himself an expose his vulnerabilities. But they also want him to be a towering pillar of strength and self-confidence, because that's what's attractive. Lo and behold, when I try to express the fact that I'm actually not this ridiculously self-confident and completely emotionally self-reliant thing, they are gone in a flash.  




 Can you imagine it without the u and g? 




 Australian here: people who drive supercharged V8s like they own the place are generally shunned from society.  




 I was actually expecting 'listen when I'm upset and don't try to fix the problem' 




 everyone hates having me around them

As someone who used to think the same thing, I can assure you that they don't. I have atrocious self-esteem (it's getting better, and I'll tell you why), and frequently would go out with my friends and return home feeling like shit because of all the stupid things I've said or done. Focus in every tiny little thing that indicates that someone hated me, even though they'd been friends with me for years. I was utterly convinced that all these people despised me. This was because I deliberately sought out *excuses* to hate myself - evidence to support the warped view I had of myself. I would focus on every little thing I had done, and either blow it way out of proportion (like a joke that wasn't THAT funny, but could have been worse, becoming the most stupid fucking thing I've ever said) or come up with reasons why they actually hate me for it - which are completely unreasonable. I focused on every little bad thing I'd done and completely ignored everything good, or rationalised the good things to actually be a way to hate myself. So all I saw were bad things, all the time. You, I think, are doing the same. My friends, not being severely depressed, only saw the many good things - good jokes, kind gestures, insightful statements, general friend things - and none of the bad, because I hadn't actually done anything wrong. They thought I was cool. But I just couldn't see it, because I was so determined to prove them all wrong and took such pleasure in destroying myself. 

In summary, I can assure you that people love to be around you. You either don't notice the signs or are deliberately telling yourself they're wrong. If they didn't like you, they'd tell you to fuck off to your face.  




 What are dad jeans? 




 I find that the fairly standard (as in not too experimental) outfits from /r/malefashionadvice go over well.  




 Apple in the mouth? 




 It is, because advise is a different word.  




 Do males who don't have a no-nonsense exterior still get points for being sensitive? I feel that I don't because I'm not all "manly man" and that being capable of communicating my emotions without being forced at gunpoint has made me unattractive.  




 Also centre. 

Are you sure about colourise? 




 I don't even know what she was trying to imply. That you actually molested the babysitter? 




 I %100 agree with what you just said, but how is it relevant to women being encouraged to compare their bodies to media figures more than men? 




 Yes, but males are taught to compare their ACTIONS to role models - being manly, successful, and rich - whereas women focus on their bodies. 

You rarely hear a woman say 'omg, I wish I had her personality.' 




 You're quite right. If you're attractive enough and you make an approach, a woman is very likely to succeed. 

It seems to me that women have the dating world much easier than men.  




 Women are very, very strongly encouraged by media and society to compare themselves to supermodels. Not so much for men.  




 This comment makes me sad.  




 I think it is much easier for women to be attractive than men.

 As much as I agree with you, please elaborate on why these things are incorrect. It is a thread for newbies, after all.  




 It's half advice and half bragging about how he's a "master seducer" with "over a hundred lays," "always hanging girls" etc etc. If there wasn't some fairly solid (if distastefully presented) advice in the post I'd suspect he was a fourteen year old virgin  




 Severely. I hate to say it, but to some people this community has picked up quite a bad reputation in other parts of reddit, and posts like this are what give it that reputation.  




 The extra room in the head creates more movement, friction with the glans, and thus pleasure. 




 Such as? We are in a thread for sharing for the unenlightened. 




 Also: magnum condoms are are wider, not longer. Most people do fit them, and they can increase pleasure quite a lot.

edit: to be precise, they are wider at the head. 




 Why shouldn't you do it with just anyone? It's not that special - as a matter of fact, it tends to suck for all parties involved - and is best gotten over with quickly so you can practice and actually make it enjoyable.

 Here's your hat and coat 




 I don't think I was ever a truly horrific 'nice guy,' but I struggled (and still do) with the idea that some selfishness or at least putting self-interest first in a relationship is not only healthy but almost required.  




 I'm from Australia, it's basically required 




 I think you're going to get downvoted for this because your wording is a little aggressive, but it would be worth noting that this is the impression the comment's OP receives from reddit, not necessarily her opinion on the world.  




 Yeah I did, OP clarified it for me.  




 I said it in the other thread and I'll say it again: I think that /r/seduction, despite its flaws, actually teaches men to treat women better and be less misogynistic by dispelling the myth of the friendzone and showing them how to be genuinely attractive. 

Perhaps a better example is /r/faimprovement.  




 My mistake. It's a little different then, but I still think it would be a shocking idea to say I love you regardless of how he feels about you. On one hand, even if he does feel the same, I'd say you haven't been back together for long enough for it to withstand that level of serious commitment. If he doesn't feel that way about you, sheer and utter disaster.  




 EDIT: I derped and missed the fact that they're back together now. Keep that in mind. 

I think the fact that he's not your boyfriend and hasn't been in a year would have been a nice inclusion in the title. 

I'm actually not going to go back and read it all because this question is very, very easy:

1) does he feel the same about you? Do you know this for certain? If yes to both, get back together and be happy. If no to either, proceed to step 2. 
2) he no longer wishes to be in a relationship and has moved on. There is *absolutely nothing* you can do about this, and you need to move on as well. It was good while it lasted, and now you need to pack up the memories and think about someone else. Continuing to dwell on this guy will only hurt you, and telling him you LOVE him will stir up all kinds of trouble (even if he still has genuine affection for you). 




 When you phrase them in a way that makes men feel manipulated by the big bad nasty women, of course they will.  




 PSA: 'whoosh' has been so used and abused that it is now downvoted regardless of context and usage. Please stop trying, for your own karma. 




 I think you're the female version of the 'nice guy.' 




 I find it incredibly ironic that (it seems to me) the type of people who think that the best way to be attractive is to be nauseatingly nice to women are usually the most casually misogynistic. 

In this way, as someone who regularly reads /r/seduction with their doucheometer primed and their salt shaker at the ready (just in case, it's usually a fairly nice place), that subreddit actually teaches and encourages BETTER treatment of women - usually by turning jaded and misogynistic 'nice guys' into people who are accepting of their own flaws and of everyone around them, regardless of gender.  




 ... yeah that's a bit messed up. 




 Let's hang on a second. From what I've read (and please correct me) we have no indication of whether this Cheyenne KNOWS the man is taken, let alone married. 

She might think this is a perfectly legitimate relationship. Yeah, a 16 year old going out with a 25 year old is weird (and seemingly illegal in OP's area of the world). But I've seen weirder, and young girls have a serious boner for older guys. This isn't going to change. Let's not crucify her as a manipulative, husband-stealing bitch just yet.

EDIT: for some perspective - and I know this isn't quite the same nor the same level of magnitude, but I'm currently 19. When I had just turned 18,  my first kiss was with a 23 year old girl. It didn't go further than that and we're now friends. I don't consider it a negative experience at all, and though it's a little different because I was legal everywhere and male - and thus completely impervious to all forms of manipulation or sexual abuse (sarcasm) - I think OP's case could be viewed in a similarly more generous way. Teenagers will be teenagers. 

The 25 year old man, though, is just a cunt.  




 how to make friends better than normal people do 




 Her: I have a boyfriend
You: I have a maths test tomorrow
Her: what?
You: oh, I thought we were talking about stuff we can cheat on

EDIT: Not seriously suggesting using this, it's just a joke I heard.   




 I suppose that if everybody is equal in value there are a lot more options, and an increased chance of securing another partner. Interesting idea.  




 I might add that relationships at your age usually last for a few months at best, so the whole dramatic declaration of undying love is probably going to be moot a few years later.  




 Bro, there are many, many people in the world who didn't 'get a girlfriend' until 18 (like me) or even 21. 

If you tick off the years on your calendar and worry that you are x age with no relationship, then you're treating it like external validation of your self-worth, and as a status symbol. That's quite unhealthy, and when you do find a girl at whatever age, that's the only way you will see her. As an achievement, something you get points for on Xbox live. 

Relax, wait for someone you are comfortable with and genuinely wants to be with you - more importantly, someone that YOU genuinely want to  be with - and then go for it. Not before.  




 It's also fairly evident from all the threads about men receiving compliments - there was a good one last night - that even for the attractive ones, it's basically impossible for them to think someone might be interested in them or find them attractive. I think men purposefully ignore a lot of hints and put them down to accidents or vagaries of behaviour. 

There's also the fact that it's much more risky for men to act on a hint than it is for women. The terms 'creepy' and 'potential rapist' spring to mind.  




 I'm 19, and believe me, people change at the end of school. They get tossed out of their established social circles and comfort zones into the big wide world, and they grow up real fast. 

As far as the dating world goes, I've noticed people become more mature and less selfish in their relationships - less likely to dump someone because they know they can get another due to their social status (as the quarterback, cheerleader etc).  




 Or we don't know that we are because no one ever tells us 




 Pretty sure singing that song actually makes you more manly 




 I'm a big hit with female octopi? 




 Squishy and round? Like the rest of me? 




 I don't know why people would bother trying to pass fake off as real when we have /r/eroticliterature. Plenty of good stuff over there.  




 You're not forever alone. You're not ugly. You're awesome, and everyone here thinks so. 

Don't let me hear you say any bullshit in return, because a) every 'forever alone' I've known usually finds great happiness as soon as they stop using that as their identity, and b) self-confidence and assurance are the most important qualities in being attractive to females. Bottom line, if you label yourself as forever single, YOU WILL BE. 

But I highly doubt that at 27 you've gone through life with no female attention whatsoever - even some that you haven't noticed, probably because you're busy convincing yourself that you're not awesome. 

So go be awesome.  




 This doesn't mean at all that we don't FEEL this excitement. With my ex, I couldn't get over the fact that she was a concert violinist and incredibly intelligent and into all the same books as me and blah blah blah.

But I'm not allowed to tell anyone, because let's face it, guys aren't socially allowed to feel those things about ourselves or each other, let alone another human being that I'm only allowed to publicly view as a piece of meat I have sex with. So for most of us, if the only thing we care allowed to say is how good the sex is or something equally demeaning to her, we'd rather say nothing at all.  




 Yeah, you don't want to scare him off. Especially if it accidentally all goes south and his response is a solid no (for whatever reason) - you can come back from a 'let's go out some time,' but you can't recover from 'I've loved you since I was seven.'  




 Dicks can be as wide as coke cans?

Well now I feel self confident 




 Most people shame Size Queens because a guy who says "I won't sleep with a woman unless she has large breasts" would be drawn and quartered. It's only fair.  




 Moooooo 




 If a relationship is essentially being really great friends plus sex, then you'd think the majority of the personality qualities you look for in a relationship are also found in your friends.  




 That's absolutely fascinating. Thank you.  




 If the female masturbation thread over in /r/sex is anything to go on, my friends (who are mostly female) aren't attracted to me (nor do I want them to be). How could they judge? 




 Trouble is, we have no frame of reference for comparison. I *think* I'm really into my hobbies, I *think* I put a lot of effort into being well presented and fun to be around, I *think* I work really hard at my career - but what if I don't? How will I know? 




 Soon there will be a reddit financial crisis from all the lost upvotes.  




 ... does this mean that males have or are willing to have a great deal more imagination in these things? 




 Extremely. 

I think this is also fairly well known in the gender subreddits. Probably not worth a thread on.  




 Sex with slenderman? 




 Not all of them do. That's a huge generalization. I'd actually say quite a lot don't, and that reddit is a biased statistic to draw on. 

Both of my best friends are female and I will never sleep with them. This is my *own choice* (as well as presumably theirs) because I value their friendship.  




 This is actually a very interesting comment. I know the 'friendzone' is an utter load of shit - basically Nice Guys who are emotionally and in personality unattractive whining about how they don't get laid - but the counter argument to it is usually that "it's the same for both genders, of you're not attractive you're just not attractive" etc - which is some merit. 

Here, however, we have direct evidence that the genders do actually have different potential-sexual relationships with their friends. 




 Dude, you have so much self-confidence, self respect, determination and charisma. When you lose a bit more, you're going to be beating the girls of with a stick. Seriously. Hell, you probably do now.  




 A further point to take from this - you know that guy over there at the bus stop, who looks really serious and intimidating and unapproachable? He's just as afraid of you as you are of him. 

This also applies to approaching the opposite sex. At the end of the day, past all the seduction techniques and the game and the self confidence and the blah blah blah, the girls and boys you talk to have just as many insecurities and fears as you do. They're trying to hide them and put on a brave face just like you - but they still really just want someone to love them just like you do. They're not so terrifying after all.  




 Congratulations. I'm really happy you're still with us. PM me if you ever need to talk - if you feel that way again.  




 concerned for my physical safety

I'm sorry, but don't you think that's jumping the gun a bit? So he comes off as rude and immature. He doesn't pick up social clues. I'm hardly an expert, but that all sounds like he's on the autistic spectrum to me. To be assuming he's a physical threat to your well being because of some sarcasm is a bit offensive - and that behaviour and attitude is, in fact, dangerous to him. 

If all of this behaviour was coming from a female, would you label them as a potential murderer or rapist? 




 Damn right man. That's the correct attitude. 

I lost mine when I was 18, and while it was fun and I've done it again since (... a fair bit), you're not missing out on anything vitally important.  




 Jesus loves you more than you could know, wow wow wow 




 How was that an issue?! 




 I wish everyone has this kind of tolerance. I got dumped by my ex girlfriend because - I quote - "I wasn't enough of a dickhead to her."

I know exactly what I did wrong, I was a bit too nice and not 'exciting' enough - too easy to be in a relationship with - but it still seemed pretty unfair to me.  




 Noob question, how are you achieving that particular look with your cuffs and that jumper? 




 Would you please elaborate for the noob on Barney's anti-PUA? 




 Hi mate. I broke my laptop a few days ago, and I've just realized AlienBlue doesn't receive PMs. So I won't be able to read what you've sent me until I've got access to another computer, which shouldn't be too long, but please don't think I'm ignoring you or that I don't care.  




 That's no problem. I'm sure I'd be equally offended if someone said that men don't have body image issues or a damaging media stereotype to live up to like women do.  




 Thank you. However, somebody evidently disagrees with you.  




 I'd say the reason for this is almost exclusively a focus in media on chivalrous and kind, door-opening, dinner-paying men, with a lot less representation of the dominant aspects that make them attractive, so as not to appear superior to women and offend the vocal and relatively new feminist community.  




 You're absolutely right. If they're not attractive, it's just not going to work. I think it really should come down to *awareness* of the exact things females find attractive (as opposed to the things that males think females find attractive) - ironically enough, I had no idea until I ventured into these parts of reddit.

I actually think a discussion of what both genders typically find attractive should actually be a core part of sexual education classes.  




 The first one at least is something they just to man up and deal with to get past, just like we do.  




 I never said women don't have dating struggles. I just don't know what they are, probably due to the fact that I'm 19 and reasonably inexperienced.  




 The reaction to a female showing her vagina would most likely be much less legative than that to a male displaying his penis.
