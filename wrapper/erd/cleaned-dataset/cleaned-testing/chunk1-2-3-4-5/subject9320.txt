 Can someone explain what he did? I feel like what he is saying is that the illegals that cross the border are bad people. Is it wrong to say because most of them aren't? Is there a border problem where drugs and gangs from Mexico are bringing crime to the U.S.? Is it dangerous for Americans living there now? He didn't call all Mexicans rapists like people want to claim. Did he cross a boundary by even bringing it up when it's not a problem at all? Where can I find this info? 
























  e made up some bigoted, xenophobic bullshit to feed the mouth breathers. You seem to have bought into the bullshit.

 I was just asking for some insight since I didn't feel like studying up on all the figures and didn't see any comments discussing the facts. All I get is your bitchy reply. And another guy who says he called all Mexicans rapists.  
























 Not that what he said was right or factually accurate but I don't understand how people think he thinks all Mexicans are bad people. Or even most. He just thinks there is a huge border problem and a lot of the illegals are dangerous. He might be wrong. But that doesn't mean he is racist. I think a lot of people are being unfair and not even trying to understand him. I am willing to say he is your typical narrow minded republican. 
























 The way I see it he thinks Mexico is dangerous because of gangs and corruption. Whether true or not this is a governmental issue not a race issue. He is willing to say many nice things about Mexican people so it's not like he doesn't like them just because they are Mexican. 
























 What are you saying? It IS dangerous or not? Very curious about this.
