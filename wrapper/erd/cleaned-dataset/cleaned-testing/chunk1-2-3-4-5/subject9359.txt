 i sleep all night and i sleep all day. i have fatigue and exhaustion where i fall and can't walk.  




 i always need someone to talk to.  




 his dose is 60mg or citalopram.  




 he has tried changing antidepressants. at first it worked but it made him have a breakdown so he went back to the first ones.  




 i watch movies and listen to music and read books. i used to be very active but can no longer be.  




 i am in a very loving relationship. we have been together for 2 years. we live together. but our sex life is unfulfilling. it hasn't always been. at the start we had sex all the time and it was amazing. but he is on antidepressants and it crushes his libido and he can't get hard properly or for long. we have tried viagra but it wasn't the same. i don't know what to do. he was a virgin before me. and he is the 17th guy I've had sex with. so sex means a lot to me. it is making me unhappy. we bought a vibrator which spices things up but its not being fucked with a cock. am i being selfish? we do oral which is great but it gets boring. i have thought about leaving him. i have thought about cheating on him. i don't want to do either. should i just be okay with sex every 2 months? we usually do other stuff like fingering and hang jobs weekly.  




 I'm trying not to do anything stupid. my boyfriend is going to hide any dangerous objects in the house. i tell him i want sex but he has got a low libido because he is on citalopram so we don't do anything. i suffer from fatigue and exhaustion and have no energy to lose weight.  




 thank you for the kind words. i just wish i wasn't this way.  




 i wish i was dead. i am usually really apathetic about it. i just want it to happen and me not to have to do anything. 

i have no more energy. 

i want to slice my skin open. i am fighting it. i have self harmed in the past but managed to stop. 

i don't care about myself anymore. i don't wash. 

i feel like i need to do something quick. 

i am in a loving relationship. he has depression and is very stable. he is understanding. but the sex life is diminished. i want sex. 

i am all over the place. 

i managed to ring for help when i wanted to kill myself. i wanted to jump off a bridge. 

i have no friends. 

i have borderline personality disorder. i was on citalopram. i have started a new antidepressant but it is not working. 

i am fat and i over eat. 

i need to vent. 

there us more information but i can never remember all of it.  




 I am in a very similar place. I have been dealing with depression for the past 5 years. i have tried to kill myself in the past. i have self harmed in the past. this is my first comment on reddit and i have joined reddit about 15 minutes ago. i have no one to turn to. i have been in and out of doctors rooms for a while now. I have my first psychiatrist appointment in 2 months and i don't think i can last until now. i haven't self harmed for a long time but i really really want to. i want to kill myself and am fighting it. i am really unhappy. i can't find my way out. also i get really severe pain in my back and neck from the stress of it all. 

its good you are getting help. the line you wrote ' I have a lot of trouble concentrating and sometimes it's hard for me to speak clearly or in complete sentences. ' its like i was writing it because i get that.  
























 ill be your friend  




 thank you for the advice and support. i do want to be with him for as long as possible in my life because i love him loads. he supports my problems as i take antidepressants as well but I've never had a decrease in libido. i will talk to him about a sex therapist. we can think about exploring new things to do. i do get quite upset when he can't make me orgasm but that is rare. i give him direction in what i like but i think the problem is also that he hasn't tried anything in terms of sexual experience and experiments. i have in the past done sex acts outside of the bedroom and in the public but he hasn't so that is something we can do together. maybe get a new sex toy purchase.   




 that is the dose that works for him but not sexually. i think he's going to try and lower it and take something else as well so he doesn't feel as bad  




 are you being sarcastic?  




 i have talked to him about it. I've told him various times recently and in the past I'm thinking about leaving him. i told him yesterday i was thinking about cheating on him. it made him cry.  




 i know how you feel. i am angry all the time. everything annoys me. my body aches. i get fatigued. 

keep venting. keep talking.  




 i dont recall the one that he took at the time  




 he said he will go on different antidepressants  




 i havent  




 i told him it was making me unhappy 
























 i self harmed in 2012 but stopped. i am now having thoughts and urges to self harm.  




 that sounds really cool. what do you study?  




 without antidepressants his libido is completely normal. its a side effect of the medication.  




 i like to go to rock gigs. i watch movies at the cinema. i listen to music. i collect film cameras. what are your hobbies?  




 i can text.  




 i started crying as soon as he started to cry.  




 yes you can be my penpal.

 i go to all sort of things alone. cinema, concert, restaurant. you go.

 does anyone else pull out there eyelashes? but tries to say I'm only doing it because i don't want my eyelashes to fall in my eye? 

i also have depression.  




 i have depression and i pull my hair. i haven't had any bald patches. i think my hair pulling is quite mild because i go for long times without doing it. then pull out loads in a few days. i haven't had any professional help about the hair pulling but i have for the depression.  




 i pull out my hair and i have so far not had any bald spots. i am 27. i think mine might be mild because i still have hair. 

i love cats too.

i don't have any friends in real life.
i have a boyfriend because i feel like i can only handle one person at a time.

 i have had laser hair removal on my face and neck and chin for 2 years and i stopped because i couldn't afford it anymore. i am still hairy as ever.  




 I have always been hairy. i have been hairy since i was 10 years old. i have tried everything. i have bleached. i have threaded. i have waxed. i have tweezed. i have used the no no hair removal system. i have tried a home laser kit. i have used scissors. i have shaved. i had professional expensive laser hair removal. i get hair everywhere. also i am indian so that makes it even worse. the doctors don't do anything. i feel so ugly. i don't know what to do anymore. i can't keep up with it. i am 27. my mum and sister get hair but its not as bad as mine. my boyfriend tells me it doesn't bother him. he says as long as he has the better beard. is there anything i haven't tried that i can do? is there any meds i can take to lessen the hair? what have you tried? how do you try and not let it get to you?  




 I've been a lot better in the past. I'm going through some things and am really ill. how are you?
