 YES get one! There are sales all the time, online and in stores, just keep your eyes peeled. Black Friday and Xmas are coming, so if you really want to get one cheap, wait until then. Also try to get one of the better brands so that your hrm doesn't pick up the signals of others around you.
 




 Just try to match handle heights. Do pause drills at different places in the stroke. 




 Try focusing on dropping it in quickly and then applying pressure right at the catch. Are you using your arms too much? Focus on driving with the legs and hips. 




 Is there an actual sciencey reason or is it just tradition?  
























 Does anyone have any articles or information on heart rates that run a little on the high side? I've done some googleing but it's always helpful to see what others have found. 



 




 Decided I want to step it up and work towards trying out for US U23 in a year or two. Bring on the steady state. 




 I don't know what your normal workouts are like but basically yes. And then throw in some extra steady state. So maybe those two workouts and then two days of SS and then weights and whatever other stuff you do, but toned down a bit because you're erging so much. Also these workouts will give you an idea of what to shoot for. Make sure you're negative splitting; it's better for your erg times and your body. 

Also the hardest part about erging is the mentality, so that's probably what you need to work on the most. Even though you know the mental erg struggle, it's been awhile and a 2k is hell. So remember that, and keep your focus while you're erging, especially through the long pieces and the last couple sprint pieces. 




 You just have to work on erging endurance and the best way to do that is by erging. I'd do some (at least four) 500m sprints and then maybe some 3x1k at like a 28 and definitely some steady state (maybe start easy like 2 or 3x15'0 just to get back into the muscle memory of erging). Don't 2k again for another two preferably three weeks.  
























 Also try not to just row one side.  









 So far we've done two 30' tests and I did worse on the second one, which is why this whole debate started. Since then I've been training with higher splits to keep my heart rate in the right zone (until the end of a piece every now and then). We have our next test tomorrow, so hopefully this will all pay off and I'll be okay.

And I don't feel like I'm killing myself at 170+ but I also don't feel like I know enough about hr zones to say that I'm okay there, because it is tiring but not that tiring. I've only been rowing for 2+ years and I've only been paying attention to my hr for the past six months. I will definitely discuss more with my coaches. Thank you so much! 




 We use our split from a 30' test +7 for SS. Most people on my team seem to be keeping their hr between 160-165 but mine is 170+. So I've been doing SS at 30'T +9 or 10. It sucks for team SS workouts because people with slower 2ks than me are finishing distance pieces minutes before me. Sometimes I get too competitive and end up pulling too hard and getting my hr above the target zone. My coaches scold me for this because they like lower hrs for SS. But I'm glad you guys are saying it isn't terrible for my hr to be a little higher because my coaches made it seem like a Very Bad Thing.  
























 Thank you! 




 Thank you! 




 They're pretty anxious because a couple of months ago the varsity team did a 2k and they watched so they could see how intense it is. Obviously that terrified them, and I'd rather they have a little more preparation than just that. Our coaches have told them some vague splits to shoot for and what rating they should be at, but they aren't ready for the mental aspect of it. Anyone have any favorite articles I can share with them to help them get ready for that third 500?
