 1 thing I don't see mentioned about 4HB is how cutting out dairy has affected people...for me it was a life-changer.  I've been a huge milk drinker all my life but also suffered from gross psoriasis on my scalp, elbows, and knees.  I'd say within a month of starting 4HB, I was completely psoriasis free.  All those years that docs had me on creams, steroids, lotions, whatever....crazy. 




 if 2 glasses of red wine per night is ok - I'm calling 2 beers a night ok too... 









 Amazing. 




 SKYDART FTW!!

You had me at "oh my Cthulhu" 




 oh stop it.

 I made a girl vomit w/ a fart once. 









 Man, I never talk about it....when my daughter was 2, I was out front flipping my 800lb strongman tire in front of the garage.  I had been drinking w/ friends and was showing off.  I was just finishing a flip whe I saw my daughter out of the corner of my eye run right under the tire just a fraction of a second before it smacked down on the concrete.  She would have been crushed to death.  That was 8 years ago. 



















 Vermiculite. 




 Slater's 









 I'd say 700-800lbs 




 awesome! 




 totally. 




 yeah, strongman or powerlifting, but folks here seem to enjoy the pics...and really it's for anyone wanting to get stronger.  Thanks for posting Kenny! 




 NorCal here. 




 Yes, unloaded w/ just the tires it's only around 150 lbs. 




 The Log 




 Where you at? 




 48" stone platform....will now be 48" stone coffin- thanks! 




 we call it the ugly yoke....great for yoke presses and awkward yoke runs... 




 awesome man thanks! 




 most stones you see here were inherited from past competitions, but we've made many ourselves using Slater's stone molds...

then just buy your concrete and get after it! 




 a lot of technique involved in stone lifting. 




 looks awesome! practice those events - 700lb yoke for 75ft sounds BRUTAL!! 




 like anything else, just watch your form and listen to your body! 




 awesome!  Shouldering a 235lb stone is no joke! 




 a friend bought it from an old Navy guy - they were piled up in his front yard. 




 I started w/ a tire - any place that has big tires will be happy to get rid of one.  Then take it home...and flip it. 




 330 stone...

 Thanks 




 thanks...yup, me a couple of years back 




 Some of my equip there but mostly a friend of mine...I have many bodybuilder friends come out to The Field for a day of training.  It's always good to switch things up...whatever your goals are. A 180lb stone would be awesome...it's hard to train for much volume w/ a 300+ lb stone.  




 Thanks man! 




 I was thinking the same...give me 10 years or so.  He's already the biggest 1st grader around. 




 You'd be surprised, not everyone in strongman...is strong.  You can still train light.   




 Thanks!

 man I love bandcamp - it's given me a new resurgence in love for metal - it's like it was 30 years ago - just browsing the metal section and seeing a tape w/ a killer cover and going for it...can you link me so I can follow you on Bandcamp?

 This has been one of the most enjoyable reading/listening experiences I've ever had.  As I read this book, I would listen to the albums I was reading about in real time on Spotify.  I could hear the evolution of metal as I read.  I did a quick search here and didn't see this book pop up so I wanted to recommend it to my fellow Shredditors.

 I recently picked up Ultimo Mondo Cannibale / Faceless and  Horror Of The Zombies on vinyl from Hells Headbangers on a whim - so glad I did - awesome pioneering stuff! \m/ 




 awesome man, just saw the SF show - CARCASS!!! 




 yea good point - have you heard Vastum though? 




 nice, I might have to make that my next show! and when did Oaktown become such a fucking hipster-fest? I went to the Vastum record release show w/ Christian Mistress at First Church of the Buzzard a few weeks back and it was ridiculous! 




 love Carach! dude, just looked at the line-up for that show - gonna be awesome! 




 dude that's gonna be fucking brutal!!  I just recently picked up a WarpVomit cassette from 20buckspin on a whim - bru-tal.  \m/ 




 Worldwide Plagues Tour w/ Sabaton opening for Iced Earth May 3 in San Francisco - never seen Iced Earth but I can't wait to see Sabaton again!  What's the next metal show you're going to see?

 a great highlighter moment from the book...

""Me and () had been awake for a pretty long time, drinking, and cutting ourselves, and the whole house we were in was full of vomit and blood."" 




 "Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult" was one of the best reading experiences I've ever had.  As I read, I would listen to the album/band I was reading about on Spotify in real time and I could hear the evolution of metal as I read - I highly recommend it!

 we got married at Garden Valley Ranch - I don't hear it mentioned often and it's really a gorgeous place.

http://www.gardenvalley.com/ 




 YIKES! 




 yet another great discovery for me from Hell's Headbangers :"Probably one of the most wanted old school death/thrash albums of the 90s. Originally released by Euronymous' label Deathlike Silence, 'The Awakening' is a slab of unholy metal violence brought back to life by Osmose Productions, and featuring bonus tracks from the legendary Uppsala gig. Here's your chance to grab a piece of underground history before it disappears into the dark again..."

 wow. 




 I love that trail/bike path!

 cool thanks! 




 some seriously majestic moustaches. 




 pic in 1st comment 




 thanks for all the input - appreciate it. 




 I've been starting it w/ mesquite chunks early in the am and keeping it fueled all day until ready to cook - I mean it seems damn hot enough. 




 that's basically what I was going for w/ this post. 




 you lost me here: Wash the dal, add turmeric powder and a tsp of oil and pressure cook for 3 whistles

no water? and do I neeeed a pressure cooker? 




 I have no arm hair left. 




 never seen or heard of ridge gourd 




 looks yum! 




 my tandoor: http://i.imgur.com/98fHLzg.jpg 




 recently acquired an awesome tandoori over and my naan is not sticking to the walls - or it's sticking too much to my naan pillow - it's either the dough, my tandoor's too hot, or not hot enough...I dunno, anyone have a authentic, tried and true naan recipe? thanks 




 inspiring! I may do this w/ chicken this weekend - thanks! 




 I loved it as well - I wanted to fucking slap the shit outta that kid! which I think is what they were going for...

 picked up The White Goddess from 20buckspin a while back and am not disappointed - besides, cheese is delicious! 




 new Obituary, Sacrificio, and various bandcamp discoveries... 




 is it explorable, or is that whole runway area fenced off? 




 One of my favorite parts of the day - when I get home after work I have like an hour and 20 before the wife gets home.  I hang out in the kitchen and spin vinyl.  Just got the new Obituary yesterday and was spinning that  - which is awesome.

 there ya go - good luck!

\m/ 




 was trying to get the basic recipe in the title... 









 awesome man lemme know! \m/ 




 it is...you know that perfect bite of pancake though? the one w/ just the right amount of syrup and a little crisp of bacon at the end...it's like that, only better. 




 RECIPE: http://www.ranchogordo.com/html/rg_cook_mondavi_tostada.htm 














 I recently went in on half a pasture-raised hog w/ a friend.  I home-cured some bacon recently and holy crap I will never go store-bought again.  We should def hook up when you get up here.  \m/ 




 how did it go by the way? 




 I like your bulk salad idea - what protein are you filling the crock-pot with?  




 would love that thanks 




 wtf do you do w/ kale - gimme a good, simple recipe and I'll try it...picked up our csa after work today and guess what?  3 KINDS OF KALE!!! 




 totally....listening to Reverend as I type. \m/ 




 I dunno, I've tried all the ones I mentioned - Bloomfield is cool cuz you can opt to just go out to the farm and pick everything yourself which is really neat (http://www.bloomfieldorganics.com/upick/) - we're just finishing our Twin Palms CSA now for the season which has been great.  I think we're just gonna do farmers markets for a while and see how that goes - too much fucking KALE lately. \m/ 




 competed in strongman for years but have slowed down...less weight more volume type stuff. 




 I've been training there w/ a buddy for 11 years...Mon-Fri 13:00-14:00 




 well obviously. 




 will it be recorded - for playback tomorrow for example? sounds awesome!
\m/ 




 that's where I am yo! the CD will be MINE!!!

 saw your post and instantly thought of that intro - thanks!

 Wow, one of my favorite albums of all time.  I picked this up on cassette in 1989, at Warehouse Records in the Del Monte Shopping Center in Monterey, CA.  That was back in the day when you bought a tape just cuz it had a killer cover...no other reason. \m/ 




 so many great CSA's around here. Tierra, Twin Palms Ranch, Tara Firma, Bloomfield Organics just to name a few.

 I see your point - got interesting I thought when she first sees the video - then the end I thought was great! 




 recently enjoyed At The Devil's Door, Come Back to Me, Wrong Turn 2, and Beneath. 




 wow, you guys are all amazing - thanks for letting me vent! xox 




 right?!?! 




 The straw that broke the camel's back occurred this past Summer when mom got wasted at a family gathering in honor of my dad and tried to drive home.  She got all dramatic and basically threw my dads ashes(in a can) at my 8 year old son who then completely lost it and was crying hysterically.  Same trip I guess my sister was telling other family members that they've always hated my wife and that she was trying to ruin/break-up the family for years etc.  My wife said that was it - she's done. 




 my sister and mom are together a codependent nightmare which over the years has tried the patience of all those around them - sis is a recovering speed/heroin junkie but per mom is "always working so hard and getting so much better" and "misses her brother soo much" ad nauseam. 




 ask a butcher what's in their meatloaf mix - usually a mixture of beef/veal/pork I think.
 




 I recently signed up for a meat CSA at an up-start local butcher shop - 1st Sat of the month I go in and get a box of random meat goodness - all local, farm-raised stuff...love it! 




 stopping by Penzey's on the way home for some Za'tar....finally gonna use the ground goat in my freezer....thanks for the inspiration!
