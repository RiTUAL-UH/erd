 Kale. All of the kale. I buy it frozen and put it in soups, stir fries, smoothies, etc... Also, garlic and spices as flavoring and I refuse to buy junk food. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but frozen grapes are a great alternative to popsicles and ice cream. 




 All in good fun ;) 




 Poutine fucking rocks. 




 I am prescribed Adderall. 




 Ha, that is pretty awesome, considering I'm a Jew. 




 Playing devil's advocate... I can understand her question, but that doesn't make the question at all okay. If she was dressed provocatively, sure, she is more at risk of harassment... Should she be harassed REGARDLESS of what she is wearing? Abso-fucking-loutely not. I would be pissed, too, but I'd see it as an opportunity to educate your girlfriend on why that kind of thinking perpetuates that kind of problem rather than just getting confrontational. 




 Tell the difference between "should of" and "should have" 




 My mother is bipolar and an alcoholic. She abused me growing up until I was 14 and reported her to my therapist. I went into the state's custody and bounced around from home to home. It was hell and I was completely fucked up from it but I became stronger as a result and after a LOT of hard work and seeking therapy/medication/help and not holding grudges or pointing fingers, I'm starting to really like who I've become. It isn't easy because I'm a very sensitive person and certain comments and events will trigger knee-jerk reactions where I can act emotionally or get angry at someones insensitivity but I think if I didn't persevere, I'd be a completely different and much sadder person...

 It shouldn't if your using the right stuff! Try making a conditioning mask that you leave in your hair... Perhaps a raw honey and avocado mask left in your hair for a few hours will help. 




 I meet amazing people all the time just by being open and not intrusive.... Just the other night I met someone who I talked to for 3 hours and he told me "I'm telling you things I don't even tell my closest friends!"
I just am really open, honest and curious about people and what they do or what makes them tick, so asking about their life and being genuine has always been what works for me. 
I also draw or write whenever I sit at a bar, which usually instigates people to inquire what I'm doing and it just kind of goes from there... 




 Believe it or not, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, etc are all fruits, despite being regarded as veggies. 
Vegetables are basically lettuces, root vegetables like carrots, etc as their seeds aren't contained/protected by the fruit (save for a few examples like strawberries where the seeds are outside) 




 It's $28 for 4 fl. oz... I believe $90 is for the 16 oz.

e: It's so dense and rich that it really only requires a small amount of conditioner. I used to use it when I got it for free when I worked in body care and it made my hair feel like bunny rabbit hair. It is amazing. 




 I doubt it will affect you any differently besides psychologically... If you're worried about it when you take lsd, you're probably going to really worry about it when you're tripping which could cause you to have a bad trip 




 [This is pretty great, albeit expensive...](http://www.johnmasters.com/hr.htm)

Also, try not shampooing your hair except for once a week or less, and only using conditioner. You can rinse your hair with raw apple cider vinegar (1 tablespoon to 1 cup water) and massage it into your hair and let it sit for a few minutes, rinse with water and apply conditioner... Shampoo strips your hair of natural oils which causes your scalp to try to compensate for the lost oils and also the shampoo just dries out your hair follicles...

 Tetsuo: the iron man? 




 My father was arrested in 1988 for being the leader of an Israeli cocaine ring. I think the story about his lifestyle and subsequent arrest would make an interesting story. My mom was also a model and a bipolar alcoholic and I ended up in foster care after 14 years of abuse and witnessed a lot of fucked up stuff in the system... I've always joked how cool it would be as a movie/documentary, even though growing up really sucked...

 Awww, the poor little guy! I genuinely think, while a lot of cats don't form emotional bonds to their owners in the way that people assume dogs do, cats that have gone through significant trauma and were rescued really are capable of recognizing it. I think it's cute that you gave him his tail and he tried to get cleaned up for you. You're a good cat mom!  




 What a pretty cat! Do you know her/his breed?

 He is doing very well! He was 9 pounds at his sickest and now he is a healthy 13 pounds (which for his size is appropriate). He also never meowed or made eye contact when he was at his sickest but now he is quite talkative and is a big happy goofball :)

 Yep! I remember refusing to participate in swim class in high school and my gym teacher made me do laps walking around the pool. He also gave me a VHS of [My First Mister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E24SGpVrs-s) because the girl in it reminded him of me. In retrospect, it was kind of creepy that he put that much thought into it, and the title is kind of wtf. 




 Note the fanny pack in the first photo... I don't even know what to say about those earrings, either. Heh, I remember he used to joke around and wear my **scrunchies** and jokingly call himself "Tina" in order to mess with my cousin and me... How he turned out to be a *relatively normal* human being is beyond me.

He also was diagnosed with [vitiligo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo) when he was a freshman in high school. He used to get picked on a lot because he wore makeup to cover the blotches. He was able to stop the progression of it by doing radiation, I believe. By the time he graduated, he was one of the most popular kids in high school. Complete 180. 




 I thought it would never happen. I still feel like that frumpy little girl who got picked on constantly... Thank you!  




 Thank you! :)

 Awesome, thank you! High west campfire is great. Rye is my favorite of the spirits so this is really awesome advice, thanks! 




 Thanks a bunch! This is good information :) 




 Haha this is a fantastic response. You hit the nail on the head with your assessment. I always prefer rye for my manhattans and scotch to sip. I'll have to think of a few more options because I'm not fond of very "sweet" whiskeys so I appreciate the direction to focus on :D 




 Thank you so much! This is incredibly helpful! I've tried quite a few, but honestly ony can remember about one or two from most categories as I wasn't drinking them with the intention of selling it, heh. I really appreciate the feedback and will keep it in mind until I have my own go-to's as ammunition :) 




 Hey all!

I just got a new job as a cocktail waitress at a bar specializing in whiskey/whisky... A lot of patrons will ask for suggestions on recommendations for a good bourbon/scotch/rye of varying conditions/batches/etc.

I was curious what r/whiskey thought about some solid go-to's and why.

[Here is the full spirits list for anyone curious.](http://www.saloondavis.com/documents/Saloon_Bourbon8.9.13.pdf) It changes often, so anything outside of this is encouraged, too, but try to stick to the list if you can :)

Thanks!

I am going into the bar before they open today to do a little practice. I'll report back after. Thanks a bunch! 




 Awesome advice, thank you!!! 




 The bar is more upscale than that, which is why I'm intimidated...

 Thank you! This is a great help!

Also, how do bartenders usually memorize so many drinks? Do you normally study it when first starting out or did a lot of it come with practice?  




 Great job! 




 This comes off more creepy and stalkerish than awesome. I feel bad for celebrities sometimes. Cool photo either way, OP. Workaholics is great... Maybe next time take a mental picture when you're in a situation like that? 




 So, I just started a new job as a hostess at a local restaurant and not even a week in I was asked if I would be interested in cocktail waitressing. I have server experience and a really great analytical memory, so I enthusiastically agreed... Cut to yesterday, I show up for my shift and was pulled aside from the (lead?) bartender and asked if I was interested in bartending. I was honest about my lack of experience which he seemed fine with (he said he prefers training new bartenders over acclimating existing bartenders with attitudes). I am heading in on Sunday to do a little training and I'm extremely nervous. I've been in myriad positions where I've had to learn on the fly, and the staff seems to really like me here but I can't help but feel like they're insane for asking me two weeks into my new job.  
  

Any help or advice on how to kick ass and learn fast would be appreciated, along with any useful tips that any new bartender should know. There's a possibility this is just a trial run and won't end up with an actual bar position, but I want to be prepared for all possible outcomes.  
  


**TL;DR:** I was asked if I wanted to be a bartender with no previous bartending experience because my managers think I am organized and a fast learner (I presume). Please help with tips/opinions in any way!  
  

Thanks for reading :) 




 Seriously, you have helped me get through SO many shitty days at my horrible job. I put a post-it on my desk that says "You didn't get mauled by a bear. You can get through this day!!!"

At that point, I figured "fuck it" and I walked back and said "yeah, I do. I can't believe you asked me that, but whatever. I'm not ashamed." He was surprised I answered, but I'd rather come off as confident than have them make up their own stories for what I choose to do in my personal life. *shrug* 




 Yesterday, I got two...

* You look hot! Like a power lesbian or something...

I work in a bar, so I get a lot of weird comments and compliments from drunk people.

Also, you're a babe. 




 Well excuuuuuuuuse me, princess! 




 I'll post more in the comments as I continue to write this out. I just really need to get this out somewhere... I apologize for my crappy writing skills.  


Its been a long time since Ive openly written about what my life was like growing up.  A part of me has been putting it off because Im not sure how vividly I remember it but despite the amount of time Ive had to move past it, I am still affected by it somewhat regularly.  


First off, a little backstory may help:  
Before I was born, my mother was married to an Israeli man. I have an older brother who was born in 1986. I am not sure how long she had been with my father prior to that, but I was born two years later.
My mother was a model in the eighties. Nothing noteworthy, but from what I gather, she did well for herself. She was a beautiful woman and met my father through a friend of hers. My father was a wealthy businessman who owned a limousine service and invested in a few local restaurants. My father had property in NY and MA; possibly more, but I am not certain.  
In 1988, my father was arrested for drug charges that pointed to him as the leader of a Brookline cocaine ring. Based on the legal documents I could find, he had been responsible for trafficking somewhere in the realm of 350 kilos of cocaine from 1986 to 1988 and was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison.  


Growing up, I didnt know my father. I knew of him through idle mention, but my mother had already settled down with a new man during my infancy. As far as I was concerned, my stepfather David was whom I called daddy. Growing up, I remember him as a very good father- he was goofy, loving, supportive, etc. He was the co-owner of a motel in Old Orchard Beach, Maine where we would spend the majority of our summers. My childhood seemed pretty great in a general sense- I was provided food, shelter, and often, love. From an early age, however, my parents fought a lot. I used to be a pretty happy and outgoing toddler, but there was often fighting in the home that my brother and I would bear witness to.  
I suppose I should preface that mother is bipolar. Being the youngest and most sensitive child, I was often subjected to psychological, physical and emotional abuse at the hands of my mother. Children are inherently needy; they rely on their parents to be a support system during their upbringing and, while I was provided with a lot of love and great experiences growing up, there was an insidious darkness in our home that grew steadily over time.  


To summarize what life was like growing up, here are a few memories I have, both good and bad, in as close to chronological order as my memory will allow.  

* 	My mother used to sing songs to me while running her nails through my hair as I fell asleep. I often asked her to sing me sad songs because from an early age, I was all too familiar with crying myself to sleep (and the deep comfort it brought)


*	My mother threw wonderful, extravagant Christmas parties for her friends that were always such a joy to participate in. The preparation it took prior, however, weighed on her and she often took it out on my brother and me. One vivid memory I have was of her slapping me and shoving my face into a cookie wrapper I left on my bedroom floor; she shamed me like an owner shames their dog for having an accident.


*	If I wasnt polite or if I spoke out of line, I would be smacked on the mouth and shamed into submission. My aunt recalls a time that she took me into the city during one of her visits; she said that I waited for her at the door with my little suitcase packed and refused to leave the doorway. She bought me a stuffed Pumba doll from the Disney store and when I came home, I insisted that it was okay that I had it because it was on sale and that I wasnt a burden and/or hadnt coaxed my aunt into buying me frivolous things.


* 	One time, my mother stabbed my stepdad with a steak knife. My brother, stepdad and I spent the night in a motel and he called us out of school the next day. I dont remember much, but I remember sitting in silence in his car in the rain while he thought about what to do. We returned home the next day.


*	In middle school, I remember my mother beating me and mocking/shaming me particularly bad. I was already picked on pretty bad in school and didnt want to show up puffy faced and disheveled, so I skipped school and instead hid in our family van. Since I didnt have a watch, I returned home at what I thought was an appropriate time, only to be berated further.


*	Some nights, when I couldnt sleep, my mother and I used to dance to Roy Orbison records in our pajamas until I was tired. 


*	During thunder storms, my mother allowed my brother and me to draw on all of the mirrors and windows with washable markers.


* 	My mom was amazing at sewing and often created our Halloween costumes, wedding clothes, holiday garb, etc. from scratch. The house was always decorated beautifully for holidays, and my mother made the most creative Easter baskets, threw the most fun Easter egg hunts, etc. 


	When my mother was a good mom, she was the best. When she was bad mom, she really made life a living hell. My stepdad is the kind of man that secretly needs a woman to bully or control him. I spent my whole childhood believing that it was normal for my dad to sleep on the couch downstairs. He did his best to protect me when he was home and I always idolized him as my protector and my best friend. Despite his aloof urgings, I was still subjected to consistent, sporadic shaming, beatings, mockery and threats. My own mother would get drunk nightly and call me a cunt; I was told that I was a loser, unwanted, a drama queen, etc. on a too-regular basis. The mother I loved was the living embodiment of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. For fourteen years, I familiarized my beautiful mother as the volatile monster, dormant only when she was left alone to sit in the pantry and chain smoke cigarettes and binge on Coors Light. 


	After fourteen years and countless character and body shaming, physical and psychological beatings, and having to carry my mother to bed drunk, my mother kicked my stepdad out. Loud fights, name-calling and character bashing were a nightly occurrence and my stepdad just endured the abuse like a prisoner afflicted with Stockholm syndrome. It was less than a week later that I followed; I had confessed to my therapist that my mother had beaten me pretty badly on our staircase (the first confession I outwardly made to my therapist, or anyone else, in fourteen years). I was sick of being treated like garbage, and since my stepfather was gone, the abuse only got worse. I remember so vividly the moment my therapist, Gerarda, asked me if I was certain that I wanted to make such a claim, because it would change my life forever. I told her I was, but I had no idea how much my life would change from there.

 oh my.... 




 Oh my god, my ovaries 




 Oh, I know what's coming :)

edit: but I WANT TO BE HER 

 




 I can't get killed because there already is a main character named Shae in the books/show. :(

Granted, my name is Shea, but it's pronounced the same. 




 How is this not getting more attention?! Damn fine. 




 [A school consists of all male, smaller fish and one female, larger fish. When she dies, the largest of the males changes gender to become the dominant fish within the school](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/08/clownfish-are-all-born-male-a-dominant-male-will-turn-female-when-the-current-female-of-the-group-dies/)

I tried to tell a guy who was wearing a shirt with a clownfish on it at a bar that it was a great way to pickup ladies... All you have to do is correlate it to the equivalent of "chicks are the better, dominant gender in some species" or some stupid shit...

ps: I am a female. I am also an ass at bars, though.

 Seconding this 




 I've had a ladyboner for him since before I even acknowledged boys existed 




 I don't want to know what that business card looks like... Unless it's Patrick Bateman's 





























 Scientists actually sent tardigrades into space with the mission name "Tardigrades In space" shortened to TARDIS 




 I can relate to this. Hugs, OP. Sorry you're struggling :( 




 Hey, I'm a lady and I still think this is a fucking badass apartment. I'd live there happily! 




 Xioacan old fashioned.  

2oz Mezcal  
Muddled sugar cube and luxardo cherry  
2-4 dash hellfire bitters  
Add ice, top with ginger beer 




 Whoa, this is an old post, haha. Thanks, I guess? 




 this is awesome, thanks! 




 I know, but I can dream!!! 




 The first thing I thought of was how fucking cool it would be to have eyes that see colors/uv/infrared like the mantis shrimp can. THE THINGS WE COULD SEE! 




 Why would you post a video of yourself throwing a giant tantrum? 




 clearly! 




 Gotta keep fighting the good fight! **hugs** 




 One of my best friends almost died from lupus. Her story is so sad. She is better now, but she has to be really careful lest flare-ups happen. She broke out in terrible hives when we were in Spain together and her throat almost closed up. It was really scary being in a country where none of us knew much of the language during a situation such as that.

"I won't call it rescue what brought me here back to  
The old world to drink and decline  
And to pretend that the search for another new world  
Was well-worth the burning of mine"   




 I... have a weird opinion of feel good music, haha. 




 The one that drunkenly hits on me and when I say I'm not interested calls me a lesbian.

 This. Just don't shove faith down my throat and we're cool. I won't shove my lack thereof in yours. 




 The thesaurus is a great source! Any smartphone has a thesaurus in conjunction with the dictionary app. Type in a word, find something similar.  

My favorite word is "absolutely". It may seem silly and common, but the use of absolutely in place of "sure" or "no problem" comes of so much more eloquent. 




 Depression/suicide awareness. I feel like so many people are depressed but so few people have the tact or understanding to be a supportive friend to someone struggling with depression. So many people give advice but usually all someone wants is to *not* talk or think about their issues. That's what a therapist is for. We just want to be distracted as a way to be cheered up.  

Also, eating disorders. There isn't a whole lot of understanding with the kind of addiction and struggle that ED sufferers endure. A lot of people think it's about vanity when it very rarely is, or, if it started out that way, it never is the reason for persisting.  




 God I love Josh Ritter. Another new world is absolutely gorgeous. Also, The Temptation of Adam... 




 Saloon! 




 Boston shaker is the best! I live and work at a bar right by there :) 




 I got my septum done at chameleon in Harvard sq in the garage. Very clean and professional. This was in '09 and I still have it; no complications, and painless. 




 Whoa, really?! I always thought it was a healthy alternative to *eating food*. 




 Smoking. 




 Dark, malty beer and almond butter... mmmgod yes. 




 There's a restaurant in Canada called "Signs" that is an all deaf staff where sign language is mandatory for ordering. You could probably work there even if you weren't deaf, I'm sure... 




 Even better: "What do they mean?!" 




 Hahaha, true story. I worked as a travel assistant in a call center that sold tour packages to American seniors. I chatted for a good hour with this guy's father! Dude was hilarious and so proud of his kids! 




 Honestly wasn't expecting the comment to get noticed, let alone be so popular, haha. 




 Ugh, thank you for referencing Big Mama! I feel like nobody knows her and it's tragic because she's *fucking awesome*! 




 Right there with you. It's a blessing and a curse, damn it! 




 Yeah, if it becomes a massive string it can be a little cumbersome. 




 Night mode is pretty rad. I should probably do that for my eyeballs sake. 




 So many different platforms I'm learning about! 




 Well it's not *too far* from the truth.  




 Ha, well based on everyone elses response, it seems like I'm not the only one. But, you know, it's cool if you feel that way. 




 I had people trying to get me on reddit for about three years. Now I have no life. 




 I'll agree with you there. I've gotten to liking the layout in a lot more ways than I initially thought, but there are still flaws that sometimes keep me from commenting/participating. 




 I refuse to download any platforms for reddit. I already waste too much time here 




 That sounds awful! 




 Yeah, it takes time. Now that I'm used to it, I actually quite like the layout. 




 Yeah, I feel you there... I spend WAY too much of my time on here. 




 I was coaxed into trying SomethingAwful and used to browse it regularly. It got kind of boring and I ditched any type of forums for a while. Eventually, friends of mine kept forwarding funny/interesting threads and I decided I'd give it a fair shot. Still hooked. 




 Touch 




 Hahaha, at least you kept trying! Dr. Pepper is huge in Texas. 




 That's fair. I can agree with that. 




 Haha, yeah but for some reason men think the same thing. When I specifically try to give off the "just being friendly, not interested in dating, but you're cool, bro." vibe, a lot of men take it as playing hard to get.  




 Yeah, gay men seem to have no problem flirting with women and women definitely tend to be okay with it. I think it's just "fun" for the guys and "safe" for the women. 




 They'd be more likely to have an orgy if they're **all** gay, don't you think? I guess I would consider myself straight because I pretty much only date men, but I enjoy sleeping with women. I prefer not to consider myself any particular sexuality because it's not really that black and white, though. Pansexual? haha... 




 Ah, I used to work in a cubicle. That shit would *not fly* there! 




 Thanks for pointing that out! Derp. I work at a bar. There's really no such thing as harassment in bars. I mean, obviously *there is*, but we're all pretty open with being weird and inappropriate. It's best to just roll with it rather than get all uptight. 




 Eh, I don't think so. We're just very open about our sexuality/sex lives at work. Restaurants and bars are pretty inappropriate by normal job standards. 




 Nope. I have long hair! It was a lady coworker that said that one to me, haha. 




 I would love it if that song played in the background every time I had to tell a drunk idiot to please get the hell out of my way while I'm carrying 5 manhattans.
