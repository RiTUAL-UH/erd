 You definitely will have to choose between being a computational expert, or a synthesis person or a characterization expert. If you want to do 2D materials do apply to Penn State, Berkeley, GaTech and Rice. 




 1) No. You won't if you are doing electronic materials. But having a solid state physics course will be worth its weight in gold. A big misconception about MatSE is that it is chemistry heavy, but unless you are doing polymers you don't need to worry.

2) Many EE profs are in the fab side - ask them. Also do NOT go by US news rankings - they are utter shit in MSE.

3) I am male, but several of my friends are female in MSE, and they mostly say the atmosphere is collegial apart from the obvious overwork aspect.

4) If you really want to go for MSE - I will say go for it. But your GPA will be counted against you. It is hard to get into a good program below a 3.5 unless you have some really good experience that a PI wants or you have publications during your undergrad. 




 Do you have a good friend in your group? If possible try interacting with this lab tech along with your friend.
And email EVERYTHING. Before you meet him, after always. My rule for interacting with difficult people - take your notebook, and jot down stuff while interacting, and send an email immediately after confirming all the things discussed. Always helps. 




 There was a similar study in Economics - where Harvard, MIT and Chicago produce the bulk of new faculty.
Same in my field - materials science where the top 10 schools (top 10 is a bit debatable though) produce the majority of faculty.  




 Could you ask the company for a deferment of the job till your PhD is done?
 




 Have you taken the physics GRE? If you are looking into physics schools that counts much more often. 




 For me it has been working with an untenured faculty in a big, prominent department. They are scared, and under pressure for tenure, and all that is transferred to you with a vengeance.  




 Yes, I buy the cheapest beer possible. Every night downing a few while chain smoking is my new "me time". 




 Same here at Penn State. The campus is now dry. The school has even rescheduled its Spring Break to coincide with St. Patrick's Day so that undergrads are out of town then. 




 Yeah I was a lurker, before I decided to take the plunge, and I will learn a bit more before posting next time :) 














 I know, but as girls are bombarded 24 hours with photoshopped washn\board abs, even those comfortable in bodies feel inadequate. Just my 2 cents. 




 ya, pirate drones!!  




 Several years back, when cleaning out my grandfather's stuff we found his old Omega watch that everyone assumed had been lost for 60 years. And my first reaction was how small men's watches were back in the day! 
























 One of my friends had this exact same track (BS in Chemistry, then worked at L'Oreal, and came to materials science). My advice - you have to pay. 
As in get an unfunded masters at a decent school (top 20 will still be difficult to get into), work on research there. If your MS GPA is much better (shoot for 3.5+) - you are all set.
The con - the whole thing will not be cheap, because the dirty secret in STEM fields is that MS programs are university cash cows - so going unfunded for two years is going to cost you in the ballpark of $100,000.  




 Sadly, since he is tenure-track he will probably be railroaded. The Hunger Games that departments play during tenure sickens me. 




 Not wrong - but there is something about academia that allows toxic behaviors to fester much longer than any half-decent HR department would tolerate. Actually, HR supervision in academia almost never happens. 




 Observation from my own university: The grad student a year ahead of me in my school - are uber competitive, and many are outright toxic to work with. On the other hand, PhD students who joined with me are super nice, and we hang out after hours all the time. Same for the year junior to me. Even though one of our Assistant Professors who did his PhD from this school remarks that his cohort was much friendlier than any of ours. By the way, from this admittedly very small sample space i observed that competitiveness has no correlation with productivity. 
Two final remarks - collaboration is a must today in my field. If you want to publish in a top-tier journal you must collaborate. And secondly, being an international student from Asia myself - I find that Asian students are much more competitive, and less collaborative and contribute to the department atmosphere overall in a negative rather than a positive fashion. 




 I have several Israeli friends, and they hate, hate orthodox jews with a passion. 




 Nopes, in fact just the opposite - I had Asian parents 




 Not visiting my sick grandmother back home. Not worth it. 




 Much, much higher expectations. Failure will be much less tolerated, as people would expect you to be more productive from day 1 - (not for students who enter PhD directly from a BS - those guys catch an yearlong break).
Personally, after my MS and in a full time PhD I was surprised how sick and tired I had become of the whole classes-homework-exams grind. I almost had to pay for my negligence in that aspect. 




 Every department has its share of known assholes. And they will often be tolerated if they bring boatloads of cash.
Honestly though in my experience, untenured faculty are much worse. There are several horror stories in my department, but they are for another time, another place. 




 No, in hindsight that guy had severe anger management issues. As everyone knows grad school can often be stressful, and I have seen that my criticisms are much more harsh when I am more tired or stressed out. But it is not a valid excuse, and I am trying to work on it . 




 Years before when I was a junior FOB grad student at my previous university for my M.S. I worked with a terrible bully. It was an year which almost destroyed my confidence. Now at my current university, I am now a senior, and actually productive grad student. And I find myself being a jerk often to my junior students. Granted they are making mistakes. But on reflection, those mistakes are made by everyone early on, and were even made by me. 
Fellow subredditors, have you ever faced this? And how did you change? 




 I was on probation - got a C and had my GPA drop down to 2.84 but it is OK now - it is 3.55. In my experience, even a below 3 did not matter much. 




 1) How highly advisor dependent the whole thing is. Universities matter for resources, but your grad school experience will be massively influenced with the relationship you have with your advisor. Corollary: How terribly unstructured things are.

2) The biggest challenge IMO is to keep yourself motivated when things don't work out, which they often don't. Fear honestly drives me more often.

3) I get by really poorly financially, and do have some debt now.

4) I am still poor in structuring time - even though because I had been really productive the last few months I see light at the end of the tunnel - I will get by working 10 hours a day a few months from now on.

5) In the first year, despite what everyone says do not focus too much on research. Keep that year aside for degree requirements. It will be much less stressful later on that way.

6) OK. I have some very close friends, and I make it a point to attend parties and bars at least once every two weeks to keep myself sane. 




 1) A great fountain pen.
2) Cool bound lab notebooks with my name on it - like the custom ones from Bookfactory
3) A computer monitor

 Try Laphroaig - the smokiness is so delicious. 




 Yes - if the papers that will ultimately become your chapters are already complete. 




 Some faculty are a bit unprofessional like that. Do you work with some professor, or have a mentor faculty?
Tell them to talk to her. And yes, four months delay is unacceptable. 




 The author - a professor at BU's business school surveyed 100 employees of a management consulting firm. She found that the first group, which worked 80 hours weekly were highly praised and got the best promotions. The second group, who were vocal about maintaining a work-life balance were in fact punished come promotion time, and got negative reviews. What's interesting is the third group, who worked much lesser hours, but bluffed about their working hours to keep up the illusion of a 80 hour workweek faced no repercussions at all. In fact, they were as highly praised and as often promoted as the first group, even though they worked far lesser hours. 




 Corollary: What are everyone's opinions about the [online MS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/)? 




 Same here. Courses reward conscientiousness, not knowledge or understanding. Even most grad courses do that too. As somewhat who is perpetually chasing deadlines, and is overworked the conscientiousness I have to spare for courses is way too limited. 




 Coincidence: I discovered (*torrented*) this series in 2013, and watched it all at one go in December 22, 2013. I know that date so well because as soon as I finished part 1, I was so impressed by one man that I had to Google him: [Victor Sarianidi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Sarianidi).

Imagine my shock when I find out that Sarianidi passed away that day, just a few hours back. 
Even more amazing was the absolute uncorruptibility of Sarianidi, who first discovered and later the Afghan museum curators who later protected with their own life the [Bactrian gold.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillya_Tepe) 




 Every single interaction I had with someone from Pakistan IRL has been overwhelmingly positive. While I was in Boston, there used to a Pakistani-owned pizza place a block from my house which was my thek every evening.
Online is however a completely different story however. defence.pk fluctuates between being great and being terrible (it right now is in the terrible phase). However, in my experience a lot of it has to do with moderation. Horus, for example, over at defence.pk is the administrator, and is the primary reason for the mess over there. 




 Actually not that much - and every country tries this subtle racism. American tourists are also well known boors in Thailand, Mexico and South America. 
I have been to Mexico during what was a lean season, and while sipping some beers with the owner of a mostly empty restaurant heard that he hated American spring breakers with a passion. They will trash the place consistently every year.
Similarly Chinese tourists are often ridiculed in USA. A
As I said, it is a subtle form of racism - and we Indians should learn to recognize it. 









 I recently found out that over the last year, the most texts I have exchanged with anybody was my adviser. What was scary is how far she was ahead of anybody else. 




 True story - for an essay I recently wrote I took five hours to write it down, and seven hours to make it pretty in LaTex. 
Even though, I can now proudly say that I have learned how to make wrapfig and equations play nice with each other. 




 Even in the 21st century we still have to ask about acknowledging significant others?
Come on, we are grad student - not grad androids. 




 Maybe - and while it may sound racist to paint Asians as such, I have some rejoinders - American academia is often very different from Asian academia, and adjustment can often be difficult. Two - most Asian kids in top US schools come from much more competitive schools back home. Someone who comes in from Tsinghua or IIT had to be really work hard to come to USA - and so their outlook and attitudes are often much different. 
And three, in my limited observations, most students open up and interact better through the years (though some don't, and those who don't uniformly are from a very monoculture group where the PI, postdocs and the PhD students are all from the country, and sometimes even the same university).
 Ultimately does this matter? I will argue it does - a lot. Grad school is inherently lonely and often frustrating. You do not succeed alone though - and a great department atmosphere actually helps. The same reason that it is imperative for our schools and workplaces to be more diverse, is the same reason grad schools, and even research groups should try to be more diverse.
I am an Asian international student myself - and I am not trying to be racist here - but trying to argue for a more diverse, collaborative and inclusive research experience. 




 If you have a lot of time - try learning Beamer. Beamer's native presentation styles are hideous - but because of the flexibility, one day you may go ahead and create the [the most beautiful presentation I have ever seen](http://pyprop.googlecode.com/files/disputas.pdf) 
























 The Frankfurt School of Finance and the UN Energy Program collaborate together as [FS-UNEP](http://fs-unep-centre.org/). It could be the resource for you. 




 An *unchecked* desire for profit is evil. Let's say you, hypothetically have a ton of nuclear fissile material. Rather than turning it in to the GOI - you want to have an open auction on it where everyone from Iran to ISIS is invited - and you will sell it to the highest bidder. Why should you be arrested? After all, as per you, you just wanted to profit, and a desire for profit is not evil. 




 Mail your program coordinator - they often send out mails to current grad students to match them up. And yes, try Craigslist but take the listings with a grain of salt.
Also, try calling up [The Apartment Store](http://www.apartmentstore.com/) or the [Vairo Village](http://locations.rentberger.com/vairovillage/). Many grad students live in apartments owned by either of these two companies, and they may be able o help you out. 




 Yeah, that same woman who destroyed HP. Even though I partially blame HP for hiring her in the first place - considering how it was open knowledge that Fiorina bombed out Bell Labs, setting American science back by decades. 




 Its a good article - but you can take Akamai as one another example of university research translating to a company. 




 I suspect timelines. Tangential to the point /u/Vertov_throwaway makes - PhD research is often more fundamental which translate to the market much further down the line, rather than an immediate breakthrough. Also corrollary: how many CS companies are actually based on novel breakthroughs? In fact most of them are succesful because they have the most polished interpretation of an already established idea. 




 How about a progressive tax - increase the rate with alcohol content? But as a liberal Indian living in the States, I have drunk more than my fair share - I am still not a hundred percent sure about loosening alcohol laws. I have seen enough shit on St. Patrick's day to change my mind on alcohol. 




 Calibri is a terrible, terrible font. At least use Palatino.  




 Try the [Boston University's LEAP program](http://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/special-programs/leap/). It gives you a Masters Degree in Biomedical, Computer Systems, Electrical, Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical, Photonics, Manufacturing or Systems Engineering in three years. The program is specifically tailored for students who did their undergrad in liberal arts - so it may suit you really well.

I know several students who thrived in this program, and even went on towards PhDs in engineering at either BU or even other really prestigious STEM schools. 




 I am a bit surprised that ARL was not the target, given its much more sensitive work. 




 From personal experience - stay with an apartment company rather than an individual landlord. And also, may people sublet their apartments for the summer, or for a semester. Subletting is cheap, and you will have the time to search for a good place, if you don't mind moving again.  




 Also, interestingly apart from Alaska, Wyoming and North Dakota education budgets have been slashed per capita across the nation. 

And honestly, while I knew that Louisiana was bad, I did not know that Arizona was worse. 




 A PhD, even though comes under the purview of education, with all its associated paperwork and degree - is for all purposes an apprenticeship.

It is a relic of an earlier era, one to which graduates of the modern education system often find difficulty adjusting. The modern educational system is defined by structure and standardization - while a PhD is exactly the opposite. In fact if I have to take a guess, increasing standardization across curricula will soon trickle up to the doctorate level too.

I am not raining on the OP at all, in fact academia is filled to the brim with assholes (any department which has more than 15 faculty at least has one). But I am rather commenting on how different the PhD experience is for different people - precisely because it is a multi-year apprenticeship masquerading as a degree. 









 My adviser absolutely *loves* meetings. Which translates into something like 9 hours a week in the summer. I have tried telling that meeting so much is not very productive, as I cannot get results every alternate day - but I have not been able to convince her.

Fellow subredditors, what is the optimum meeting time per week according to you? And how do you try to achieve that? 
























 Exactly - even in the article it was mentioned that it had been going on for several years. 




 I mailed this story - linking this Reddit post - to Gawker media.  









 You have a great adviser. 




 Run away from this PI - do NOT work with such a guy. 




 Thanks, 




 Exactly - even after all this these morons are sometimes so full of themselves - it is just astounding. 




 Not sure if Poe's law. 









 I am asking on behalf of a friend. Do you guys know of Materials Science departments which have spring Phd admissions? I know of Penn State and UIUC as the only two good schools who do so.

 Different universities - different priorities. Penn State for quite a few years have invested in research equipment. Millennium Science Complex facilities rival a national lab today - which is why MatSE is the highest NSF funded department in the nation.  




 Not completely true - we cannot replace book knowledge - yet. And most MechE, EE and MatSE students are heavily involved in research too. I know of several undergrads graduating with journal publications.  




 Steidle is being completely torn down from the inside and renovated right now. The thing is - it costs $50M, and moving equipment was a year long job. Similar thing will happen to Fenske after Steidle.
