 "Kill Bill Siren" was awesome. These seriously make my week. You should do them for Better Call Saul!!! That subreddit would be extremely grateful.  




 crazy bastard 




 What I hoped for this post: something other than the obvious.  




 I didn't find this scene funny, but the fact that you did kills me.  




 Bill from Kill Bill. Not saying the five point palm exploding heart technique sucks....but he's a dude we have waited through TWO movies to see die. And he falls. On the grass. Cool. 




 Jump to Conclusions App.  




 There has to be some angle in this decision. Surely he's not ACTUALLY thinking he's above Rick's group and their decisions. He still carries the guilt of the people he left to die AND he knows he would be dead if it wasn't for Grimes and Co. So I'm thinking there's another angle that we just aren't seeing yet. Thoughts? 




 These are my new friends; the Van Buren Boys.  




 No dough....no show. 




 I seriously cant stop singing that song. "Arizona moon is shining" 




 "Great! You shot the invisible swordsman!" 




 Goodnight Ned. 




 Infamous is when you're more than famous. This guy El Guapo isnt just famous....he's INfamous.  




 Ha! My bad. I'm in.  




 I think he means that if you- SHUT UP!! 




 Tell us we will die like dogs.  




 Can I have your watch when you are dead? 




 I saw this movie as a kid and absolutely loved it. Watched again as an adult and still am drawn to quoting it and singing along. Chevy Chase, Steve Martin and Martin Short are perfect in this movie. I don't see this movie mentioned very much, but I recommend it to ANYONE who hasn't seen it.  




 I gave you a downvote.  




 I think you'd be in serious trouble if this subreddit ever found out where you live.  




 Hahaha!! That is exactly what I was looking for. The Lost Boys is so damn good btw.  




 I wasn't referring to famously misquoted lines. But personal lines that you just misheard and said wrong for a time.  









 After going through OPs post history, I have concluded he is 12 years old and needs to find another site to be annoying on.  




 I think you overestimate redditors and their love for posting absolutely anything; even if they literally just read the same post. 




 Hollywood's best kept secret in transforming characters: glasses  




 Greg Kinnear. Every time. Always. Forever. Captain Amazing.  




 Because Andrew here is very interested in pursuing a career in the custodial arts. 




 What're you referring to exactly? I feel like the obvious answer is 'no' and maybe you just got unlucky and saw a bunch of slow-song trailers in a row.  
























 Totally. I'm really enjoying these! 




 Longest yet! 




 I love this one. 




 or A Walk to Remember Me Myself and Irene 




 What is the longest title you can make using movie titles. 

For example: License to Kill Billy Elliot  




 I know its for comedic value, but its so overdone, that yes, it needs to stop. A joke is only funny so many times. 




 "Kids get scared." "Whats there to be scared of?" "No, no, I didn't say I was scared." "I didn't say you were scared." "I know." 




 In Carl's defense, he's always liked that word "gargantuan." Its so rare he ever afforded the opportunity to use it in a sentence.  




 Don't forget the constant one true dog posts.
 




 Yeah, and Bryan Cranston would play everyone. Every single role.  




 Or the OVERUSAGE of "plot armor." 




 Yeah, agreed. I think this sub is willing to post even the most absurd "theory" just for the sake of posting something. I don't think anyone honestly believes there are Ms.  




 This isn't exclusive to this sub, but I see it a lot on here: When someone comments with just "this" 




 Same with Morgan. They've made it clear that Morgan will return in some fashion but every episode that passes, Reddit tried to create clues that lead to Morgan. Knock.It.Off. 




 Actually that's a good call. I was thinking about others roles too and I'm inclined to agree with you.  




 Yeah this gets old fast. It's even worse when they are right about something though because then they feel like they have a license to FORESHADOW CONSTANTLY.  




 I'm over reading about the Rick/Shane transformation personally, and every comment in regard to Eugene being "That's classified." What're yours? 




 I don't exactly agree, but this is the kind of answer I was looking for. Actors who could play each other's roles convincingly enough. Thanks.  




 Not necessarily looking for doppelgangers, but actors/actresses who could play each others roles. 




 Don't Judge me.  




 YEAH! Best level in the game. I can never quite make it all the way through without shooting the scientists and failing the mission :/ It's just too much fun.  




 I don't know why it is being downvoted either, BUT if we're talking Bond....Peirce Brosnan hanging upside down and punching the Russian in the face while he's on the can in Goldeneye is probably better.  




 There's Something About Mary also comes to mind. 




 Detroit Rock City is such a great movie. So much fun to watch.  




 Nothing off limits. What do you got? 




 Well I want you to try....rearry...hard to get a missile.  




 My dad says that Tom Hanks looks like his mouth was ripped out and then taped back on. I don't know what he means by this, but thought you should know.  




 I take pleasure in downvoting assholes who just post "this." 




 This movie has my all-time favorite trailer.  
























 Hahaha this is a good example of what I'm looking for though. I actually didn't see either of the newer Spidermans. Rebooting the Batmans made sense to me (because of years passed and newer technology) but Spiderman just seemed way too soon. I heard they were good though.  




 What is your favorite movie, its criticism and your defense for said criticism? 




 Especially their jam session at the end. I agree. 




 Yeah! I loved Whiplash and it definitely made me want to play percussion again.  




 And what do you say about music in movies? Or movies about music? You don't think that can be inspirational? Maybe I wasn't clear in my title. I didn't mean "What action scene inspired you to play the trombone?" lol  




 Are you saying you cannot be inspired by movies?  




 That Thing You Do inspired me to take up drums (for I am Spartacus) when I was a child. I'm a guitarist now, but always credit that movie as getting me started. What're yours? 




 He killed David Palmer too, you know. Fuck that guy.  




 That's what I mean by throw-back. The director was intentionally vague about the timeline. I mean, just the use of cellphones and whatnot, we can deduce it's a modern day movie, but the heavy use of synth music and the old-style movie theater, the cars, the black and white TVs. It was done intentionally to give you wide range of impressions and feelings. I suppose that doesn't work for everyone, but I enjoyed it.  




 I had the same reaction as you OP. But it was a really cool throw back to 70s/80s horror films with a peculiarly interesting new story. I think I appreciated it more than I liked it, if that makes sense.   




 One more thing....does she know her daughter is still alive *cue the trumpets 




 He wasn't a friend to the MC, but he wasn't a villain either. I guess we'd have to establish what we mean by "villain." If you're implying anyone against the MC, then he would qualify. But that's like saying Hank is the villain of Breaking Bad because the main character is Walter White.  




 Why is he being defined as a villain? 




 One of the most overused phrases on this sub, dude.  




 Roger Workman 









 Okay, that makes sense. Thanks for responding.  




 Can you please respond to my question below when you get a moment?  




 Eve was into oranges. Everybody knows that. Duh.  




 Thank you for this. It helped immensely.  




 THANKS EVE, YA JERK! 




 So all who are Christian are elect? 




 Yeah, I feel like there should be a better word than "election" to describe the situation.  




 Wouldn't the Cross be pointless if there was unconditional election? I feel like I'm still fuzzy on the particulars here. I thank you for your response. 




 It all started one day in Eden.... 




 Hi guys! First time poster on this sub. I'm a fairly new believer (little over a year or so) and have a question about this word: Elect. Let me preface my question with saying I don't believe God is ever surprised. Therefore it should come as no shock to Him when someone becomes saved. By this thought, you could say that all who are saved are "elect" because God knew they would come to Christ. But then why make the distinction? Why aren't the "elect" just called Christians? It may just be my misunderstanding of the term, but it stings my ears when I hear people say "elect." Even if I, myself, are "elect," I still hate the title. Can someone please explain to me where my misunderstanding is? It would mean a lot. 




 You're right, it is not. Reddit is full of idiots. FULL of them.  




 House of the Devil better than The Conjuring? Are you fucking high? 




 Chicken Run Ronnie Run Fatboy Runaway Jury 
























 Yeah, the neighborhood chick that Buck diddles with the pool cue.  




 I never worked in a video store, but when I was a kid, I was obsessed with Heather Graham. I used to banter with the guys who worked there who told me she was in the movie "The Great Outdoors." I knew he was wrong, so I bet him she wasn't in it. I'd give him five bucks if she was or get the movie "Pay Back" starring Mel Gibson on VHS for free if she wasn't. I got to take "Pay Back" home with me that day. That's the extent of my Blockbuster stories.  




 Tell some stories about your days! Things that got on your nerves, interesting movie requests, celebrity sightings (and what they rented obviously) and so on!  




 I know I can't prove this, but I use this quote at least once a week.  




 ROBOT, RIP HIS ARMS AND LEGS OFF! *you can basically quote this entire movie in yells and capital letters and nobody will hassle you for it* 




 YOU BETRAYED THE LAW 




 Shut your bucket.  




 He looks like T-Bag from Prison Break.  




 You should ask if you can swap your 15 minute break for a free pass to slap a customer instead.  




 At least you're raising your children right! Never give up, never surrender!  




 I think Scary Movie fails because its Scary Movie haha Off topic here, but I think they got better when the Wayan's brothers weren't involved.  




 Don't open that! Is there air? You don't know! 




 I agree, its satirical without being slapstick. Not an easy venture as so many movies (like you mentioned Scary Movie series) go for the cheap laughs.  




 I seriously love this movie to death, but I always considered it just a guilty pleasure- the assumption being no one else really likes it too much. Turns out everyone I know loves this movie too. What does Reddit think? 




 Listen, I hate to defend Adam Sandler, but shut up.  




 Is that what you call complaining about "gay jokes?" lol  




 No. You're just a liberal baby. Your post screams "I'm uncomfortable by gay jokes."  




 Get over yourself and your idiotic desire to make all things PC. So tired of you liberal babies bitching over what hurts your sensitive feelings.  




 I said you're a cry baby 




 One of the dumbest assessments I have ever seen. Cry baby. 









 Django is American too.... 




 Ah see, Paint it Black always makes me think of Full Metal Jacket. But then so does Surfin Bird. I was gonna say Wooly Bully too, but that song actually makes me think of Happy Gilmore.  




 Yeah, and wow that was such a perfect song for that scene. You just can't hear it nowadays without getting psyched up.  




 What're your classic 'you hear a song, you think of the movie' songs? I can't hear Somebody to Love and not immediately think of the Cable Guy.  




 You smoke weed? That's awesome!!!!! 




 It is all about that East Valley :) Gilbert for the win! 




 Doesn't sound too bad. I'll try to stay awake.  




 Armageddon is hated by most because of the scientific inaccuracies. I'll take the experts' word for it, but it doesn't change the fact that it has great lines, great characters and a fun plot. It is not my favorite movie, but if you start complaining about the accuracy of this movie's elements, then you might as well discredit every movie because I'm sure you can find a bullshit in every single one.
