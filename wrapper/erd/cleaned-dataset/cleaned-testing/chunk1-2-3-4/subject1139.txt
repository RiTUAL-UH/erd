 The movie is Garden of Words and the setting is Shinjuku Gyoen in Tokyo. 









 Welcome to the Space Show. 




 RahXephon's "My Blue Friend" episode had me all teary eyed. 




 This is the Kamishikimi Kumanoimasu Shrine in Japan. I first saw it as the setting for the movie [Hotarubi no Mori e](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grTUkLgHwGM).

 5 cm per second. 




 The Rubinsky and Terran plots could have been done better towards the end. They were intriguing plots initially but by the fourth season they lost a lot of steam and didn't add much tension. It felt tacked on just to add some conflict.

Improvements in animation and ship design would also make the show better. Just imagine Walter von Schenkopp fight scenes with better animation and a bit more flare.

 Mir should work on his clinch game or just avoid the clinch altogether. Big Nog (2nd fight), Cormier and Carwin also bullied him in the clinch. 




 Leg extension, glute kickback machine and hamstring curls. 














 Bicyclists in NYC run the red light all the fucking time. I wouldn't even feel bad if I witness one of them run a red light then get hit by a bus. 




 No. His PB is 13.46 the 6th best time in the final is 13.43.

13.46 is not even a good enough time to qualify an American hurdler into the Olympics since America has quite a depth of talent in that event. For example the top three times in the 2012 USA Oympic trials are 12.93, 12.98 and 13.08.

 Or he scored the first round a 10-7. 




 Everyone's screaming about 30-25 but the 30-27's are bad too. How those judges did not score round one a 10-8 is mind boggling. 




 Two knockdowns and some beat downs in between those knockdowns, yeah pretty much a 10-8 but you never know with these judges. 









 Go home and be a family man.

 NFL TV deals are nationwide. The league itself signs those deals with CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN then redistribute some of that money to the teams. In the NBA and MLB the TV deals are regional. The team itslef negotiate those deals, not the league, which makes revenue sharing difficult because teams are looking out for their own. 




 [Wolf Children](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Children). 









 It made me feel so many emotions; joy, melancholy, sympathy, worried and relief. 



















 Pistol squats. Doing weighted pistols for 3x8, one leg at a time is freaking exhausting. 




 For those unaware, Shinkai also wrote a manga and a novel adaptation. The manga has great extensive character development on Kanae, Akari and Risa. IMO the novel has a better depiction of adult Takaki than the manga and the movie.

[In the novel adult Takaki wasn't that hung up on Akari, some memories and feelings would pop up but he didn't hold on to them like he did in the manga and the movie. He even admitted to falling in love with other women. But being heart broken at such an early age seemed to have left a lasting mark on him which led to him giving up on relationships when things get tough.](/spoiler) 




 It had a happy ending but what stuck out the most was the sad part. The scene where Asuna was running on the shallow river really got to me. 




 [] (/s "You've got to keep in mind how old they were and their situation. They were just thirteen, dealing with such strong emotions at such a young age could make one apprehensive and scared. Add the fact that they were about to move away from each other which makes expressing their feelings even more difficult. I think most adults would have trouble with the same situation.")

[] (/s "As for keeping in touch, they did try but the letters/texts were just not enough. The manga went over this really well, they both just shied away from the difficulties the distance provided. It's hard to expect two teenagers to try their best to make a long distance relationship work.") 




 I rewatched it a couple of days ago and I had to close that youtube link only a few seconds in. 




 http://i.imgur.com/m6dzIUl.gif 




 I recommend reading the manga also. Perhaps read it prior to rewatching the movie. The manga has added dialogue and scenes that does a great job of developing the characters better than the movie which also makes it all the more depressing.

 Space Battleship Yamato 2199 and Kyousogiga. I love the 70's vibe, the militaristic sound and the use of brass instruments in Yamato 2199...really got me pumped for the huge battles. While Kyousogiga's music hit that sentimental spot. 




 Space Battleship Yamato 2199 














 Nyahaha
 









 The series is set in the same universe as [The Princess and the Pilot movie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qomwjPIerM). 









 I love how Gintama manges to make juvenile humor funny again. These are the type of humor that you feel like you have moved on from as you got older but then you see something like Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon and Peen-san and you just can't help but burst out laughing. 




 The whole harem arc. Also any Shinpachi romance arc is hilarious. 




 Resident Evil is a popular Japanese made game so there's a decent brand recognition.  









 The filler and non-filler episodes prior to the Kyoto arc weren't good either but the ones past the Kyoto arc really are an absolute bore. Well I guess the the Shougo Arc was some what decent. 




 To anyone who played the VN, which route do you think is the anime taking?

I don't mind being spoiled. 




 Despite being selfish and not doing what's best for both Touma and Haruki, Setsuna is still the most honest one of the group therefore my best girl.

This show keeps going through tonal shifts. From lighthearted beginnings of a hero, to full blown tokusatsu cheese then to something dark.

I hope we get some background info on King Torture because right now he comes off as a random evil genius.

 Touma's train stop is at Iwazu-cho which is in Okazaki. She flew from Okazaki to Tokyo. 




 I think Haruki is overcompensating. He realizes he has feelings for Touma which makes him feel guilty so he compensates for that by rushing his relationship with Setsuna hoping it would drown out whatever he feels for Touma. 









 I'm so confused by this show right now. I thought the show was starting to hit its stride in ep. 6 and in the second half of 7. I was starting to have a grasp on what direction the show is going then this wacky tonal shift happened.

I'm just hoping for a payoff that would make sense and justify this tonal shift in a gratifying manner.

 Gintama has some heart wrenching moments too. [This dog story](http://vimeo.com/38013872) was such a tearjerker, almost as good as Futurama's Jurassic Bark. 









 Holy shit I don't know how to respond to this.

I was half expecting the show to go Steins;Gate on us, which means having a slow build up leading to shit hitting the fan really fast but I didn't expect the show to go full blown superhero.

I'll go with a wait and see approach before I react to this. 




 Robert de flato 


































 Space Battleship Yamato 2199 is my runaway AOTY. 









 [They're following the Gintama strategy](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/070/4/9/gintama_yaoi_motivational_by_sweetshounenai-d3bdrp2.jpg)

edit: FYI Gin and Goto share the same voice actor. 




 Oh man, this episode was hilarious. It also did a fine job of showing Masayoshi's dedication and pure intentions in a charming way without coming off corny or overly preachy.

Another thing I liked was Mari's little slip of the tongue about letting off steam, I guess that confirms she's really in it for thrill and excitement.

Also Gotobro exuded so much broness in this episode.

I need more Sumi screentime. 














 This was an excellent episode but then again most things about Yamato 2199 are excellent. More people should watch this show! 




 Reaper and Pushing Daisies, both have the quirkiness and eccentricity that might be better expressed in anime form. Also Better Off Ted as a SOL anime.

Maybe I'm just mentioning shows I felt were canceled so abruptly.  









 Moe waiting for a kiss from Mari was funny.

I like how both Mari and Masayoshi hit a lull in their superhero career and how they dealt with it differently. Masayoshi's passion for heroism was starting to fade and he was becoming jaded, then he realized he's doing this not for fun, not for the hero ego boost but for justice. While Mari was just getting bored since she has little purpose other than entertainment so she dealt with her boredom by upping the ante of her antics.

Looks like both Goto and Hazama will find a common sense of purpose and really start working together. 














 I'm surprised there were no Faye Valentine versions. The Haruhi bunny costume one was the best. 














 as expected akira loses to mori

I'm glad they didn't drag that out into a love triangle. The romance was unobtrusive and served as a good complement to the main story. 




 The Walking Dead is mainstream. The ratings for last season were high and this season's are even better. 




 Highly recommended anime. [Watch it here.](http://kissanime.com/Anime/Space-Battleship-Yamato-2199) 














 If the gif can fit in that 2mb limit without being a gif for ants or a grainy mess due to low image quality. 









  I mean, this show is about a treasure hunt basically, but this episode didn't include any part of the treasure-hunting! I'm feeling like the show doesn't really know how much time they should spend on characterization that is not the best I've ever seen but still, fairly standard.

Totally agreed with this. The lack of balance between character development and storytelling leads to pretty bad pacing. As a result the treasure just conveniently shows up instead of being discovered. Then there are these random action scenes that just pop up out of nowhere with very little set up.

Despite these glaring flaws I can't get myself to drop this show. 




 Crotch shots is cheap humor but the show somehow made it work. I guess the character, sound effects and the delivery are what got a laugh out of me.

I'm still enjoying this but it's the Goto and Masayoshi dialogue that made the show engaging and it's kind of veering away from that. Also it feels a bit directionless, other than character introductions the main story has been stagnant. I hope we see more progression since most of the main cast have been established.

 Some of the more recent Ghibli movies are pretty underrated.

From Up on Poppy Hill [(Watch it here)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQD4VH4Drvk)

Arrietty 




 **Wolf Children.** It's a sentimental and emotionally moving movie about a young mother raising her two kids that are part wolf in the Japanese countryside.

[Here's some stills](http://imgur.com/a/7yBMB)

[Watch it here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7H0Vcl8kIw)

Also check out Le jour des corneilles (The Day Of Crows). It's a very sweet french animation movie. 














 With that much muscle mass I highly doubt he neglected developing glamour muscles like the chest. Some people are just lacking genetically in certain areas. 









 Synopsis:

Hana is a 19-year-old student who falls in a "fairy-tale like" love with a "wolf man". Over the course of the 13-year story Hana gives birth to two children - older sister Yuki, and younger brother Ame, or "Snow and Rain". At first the family quietly lives in the city trying to hide their wolf heritage, but when the "wolf man" suddenly dies Hana makes the decision to move to a rural town, far from their previous city life. 









 They would all get it...get congratulations for graduating.

As for non-Ghibli movies I'd recommend [Hotarubi no Mori e](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grTUkLgHwGM) and Wolf Children. 














 Squeeze play.

 Turn on the close caption. 
























 Three point shooting is horrendous for both teams but the Nets are actually getting good looks. 




 Classic Mushishi bitter-sweetness.

I love the metaphorical use of the cold and snow to express Toki's feeling of numbness after losing his sister. Then use Tae's warmth to express the feeling of caring and comfort that helped Toki to move on. Very simple but well executed. 




  believe-in-yourself motivational nonsense

Sure it's overplayed in the sports genre (across all mediums) but I wouldn't call it nonsene. Top athletes don't reach the highest level of their craft without self-confidence, self-motivation and being pushed by someone. 




 In terms of romance:

Cross Game

Nana

Honey and Clover 




 Chaika could be another case of the lesser hyped Bones' show being the better one. Too bad it doesn't have the Noragami production values. 




 Sigh. No English subs. I was hoping to add this to my Spring schedule. Oh well, I'll just watch the movie series whenever it comes up in my backlog. 




 Shedding manly tears has been passed down the Armstrong line for generations. 




 Oh boy, I started welling up when I read the "God please..." line. The notion that's she's begging in her diary to remember all these memories was just so sad. 




 This show has an AMAZING soundtrack. 




 The way this show presents different story elements is so disjointed. There's just too much stuff going and the show is not doing much in a way of making sense of them. It was kind of forgivable after the 1st episode but after the 2nd one it becomes worrisome.

I hope there's some sort of pay-off here that would justify the chaotic storytelling.

 




 Mushishi is so good at building human relationships and drama in just 20 minutes. 




 I hope this convinces Sunrise to make another season of Gintama. 




 Better hops than VC but VC throws it down with more authority. 




 Holy crap that episode must have been expensive. The animation, background and character detail, and the lighting/shadowing were all on point. The slow-mo stuff also looked smooth and that means more frames of animation which of course is expensive.

That flashback was really really well done. Great editing and timely use of good music. That might be one of the best implementation of flashbacks I've seen in anime. 




 I think he's like a more evil version of Takamura. 




 That gave me bit of Kiki's Delivery Service vibe. A magical country girl unfamiliar with the city environment. 




 Too much going on for a first episode and a bit overwhelming.

Laying out a bunch of story elements in the first episode is a neat idea though. 




 That hand to hand combat looked good. Nice choreography. 




 Brewers have a really nice ballpark and a very fan friendly atmosphere and amenities. Also people like to go out in the Spring/Summer and baseball can be seen as a leisurely outdoor pastime. Keeping those in mind, with the right marketing you can get people to show up at the ballpark for a mediocre team. 




 Well, that was quick. 




 A relaxing episode about sake. A nice way to reintroduce the show before delving into the bitter-sweet stories.

I also liked how this episode adds to the mushi mythos. 




 /r/anime has been doing seasonal polls since Fall 2012, I think. Here's the [Fall 2013 Poll.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1uxekm/ranime_aoty_2013_aots_fall_2013_poll_results/)

 Read the first post of that thread. Or you can read the article I posted.

Japanese animation sales rose 6.5% to 78.99 billion yen (about US$768.4 million) in 2013 to its highest total in six years. Sales of foreign animation for the general public and children were 6.191 billion yen (US$60.2 million), and foreign and domestic animation sales combined were 85.17 billion yen (US$828.5 million).

 Spring and Summer seasons always get the good stuff. 




 What a scare. Should've tried harder to deny Monta from getting the ball. 




 Livingston got away with a lot of grabbing and pulling there. 




 Damn Caesar is OP. 




 The manga sales are excellent so the Japanese do like this type of story. It's just not the type of series that garners fandom and get people to buy blurays and merchandise.

Also this is late night anime so ratings don't matter.  









 I was half expecting to see the Gintama spoof of who wants to be a millionaire. 




 And it's mostly fairly well known animes. These lists would be more interesting if they're recommending niche shows like Otana Joshi, Flag, Beast Player Erin and etc. 




 This arc has been amazing.

Ippo and Silver Spoon have been providing some quality writing and character drama for the past few weeks. 




 Personally I found Courtesan of a Nation to be the best arc. 




 I love how you left out the fact that prior to the takedown Hendricks was landing consecutive punches and kicks on a gassed out and hurt Lawler. 




 The intro to the this episode was great. A prime example of how this show can seamlessly transition from serious moments to comedic ones.

The writing, pacing and character progression have been superb. The dialogue and the way characters react are believable and genuinely heartfelt. This is one of the few shows that handle emotional moments in a natural and sincere way, right along with shows like Mushishi, Cross Game, Natsume and a few others. 









 All of a sudden this show turns into a psychological thriller. I think the second half has handled the transition between tonal shifts a lot better than the first half. 









 This felt good after the way the Nets lost to Raps in the last game. 




 Blatche with some horrendous defense. 




 Lowry is really pushing his luck with the refs. Surprisingly they have been patient with him. 




 Ugh, I was really hoping it wouldn't do the "beat some sense into him" cliche. That was just bad writing because Ignacio barely exists as a character and all of a sudden he's playing a significant role in the MC's life this late in the season. It also robbed us of a possible good interaction between Kal and Ariel since it really should've been Ariel talking some sense into him. Really, the best thing this anime has going for it is the relationship between Ariel and Kal, and in a very important moment it decided to go away from it.

Pretty disappointed with this show since I really, really liked The Princess and the Pilot. 




 I find myself sometimes saying "Oy, Oy, Oy" like Gintoki does. 




 Nobunaga you spectacular bastard. I love the over the top confidence, the hubris and the grandiose. It's such a nice change of pace from other MCs.  




 This episode made me want a serious period drama anime. 




 Nets broadcast team can be hilarious at times. 

I want to see how an Ian Eagle and JVG duo would work out. 




 But damn, you can't just end it in the middle of a **well deserved ass whoopin.**

I dunno about that, the guy just found out the girl he loves is partly responsible for his parents' death. His emotional response is completely understandable. If this goes the "beat some sense into him" route then it would be some pretty bad writing.

 Oh man, I love Nodame. Great Romcom. 




 I love that little bit of introspection by Hachiken about running away might have been a good thing but it doesn't mean the problem just disappears.

Also for anyone who enjoyed the baseball part, I recommend that you go watch **Cross Game!** 




 This might be my favorite fight in the series. I really like how it emotionally escalates right along with the intensity of the fight. 














 This show is making me realize how uncreative I was during my toy playing days. 









 Even though Yukine is being a little brat, I still feel bad for him. It doesn't exactly help that Yato is as personable and empathetic as a cardboard box, and is not being a good friend/parental figure to Yukine.

After a few episodes that made me want to smack Yukine, this episode actually made me sympathize or at the very least empathize with him. Also you're right about Yato, despite his good intentions of wanting to reform Yukine and not give up on him, he really hasn't handled the situation gracefully. 




 Yukine seems to have some abandonment issues. Nora showing up and making Yukine think Yato could leave him for her seems to be the catalyst to this whole mess.

Yato knows this and doesn't want to give up on him maybe for atonement, or maybe out of compassion. 




 I like Eagle. I found myself rooting for him.

That cliff hanger though. 




 He should hire a PR person. 




 Space Battleship Yamato 2199 and Garden of Words. Both are excellent. 




 Space Battleship Yamato 2199. It's an excellent space opera not just for an anime but across other mediums. Also, IMO the far and away best anime in 2013.

Go watch it!

 Damn, shit just got real serious all of a sudden. I approached this as a "turn my brain off and just enjoy" anime but this episode is making me think otherwise. 




 Robot Family is hilarious, best episode so far. 




 That was kind of a lame fight, no tension whatsoever. I understand it's a set up episode but a whole episode about a dominant win is boring. 




 That Mari and Mizuki argument is really well written and acted. The dialogue genuinely expressed anger and frustration...then we see Moe wearing a paper bag and then yuri. Haha, only this show can troll you like that. 









 The goofiness of this episode reminded a bit of Gintama, especially the [manboarding bit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAqo1mNq15A). I didn't mind it at all and thought it was amusing until the exposition dump, which came off as forced and felt like last minute story telling. 




 There's been too many flashbacks, the show might have just as well started from the very beginning then just do a time skip. I think the pacing would've been better that way but obviously that would eliminate the twist.

Those aerial scenes looked good, pretty obvious that's where a lot of the budget is going. 




 Caesar is a big believer in ~~love~~ kidnap at first sight. 




 I've read that the American companies were overpaying for licenses with total disregard for quality but hearing some of those titles really put things in perspective on how crazy the bubble got.

 I wonder if the BD is going to have a less censored version of the bath scene just like Monogatari did...you know for science. 




 The Japanese aren't big time purchasers of DVD/BDs so it makes sense to maximize price in a limited market.


This [ANN article](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-07) explains it better:

The High Prices... Explained!

To a Westerner, the Japanese DVD market seems horribly overpriced. With the average disc running over 7,000 (US$92) and only containing 2-4 episodes of a series, the cost of collecting a single show can easily run several hundred dollars -- more than many American fans spend in a single year. 

The prices actually stem from a business practice we used to have in America, too: rental pricing. Basically, back in the dawn of the home video business, the industry was constructed in a way where "niche" releases were only meant to sell a few thousand copies, mostly to video rental shops. Prices were high (typically $89.95 in America), but video shops benefited from having a wide and semi-exclusive selection of movies that normal people would never pay for. At those prices, only a few thousand sales could mean over a million dollars of revenue. Initially, video industry people didn't think there was much of a market in selling to collectors. 

But the fans proved them wrong. Otaku of all kinds (not just anime fans) started buying the videotapes and laserdiscs, and they bought them at those high prices that were intended just for video stores. There was no reason to lower it. **In fact, there were a few experiments to drop the price to a more affordable amount, but that usually resulted in a slight increase in sales -- not enough to make up for the drop in revenue.**

When you think about it, that makes sense. Most Japanese people live in much smaller homes, and with many more people than their Western counterparts. In most cases, it simply doesn't make sense for Japanese consumers to build a big home media library. Only the hardcore fans of a particular product will usually want to bother owning a tape or DVD, and everyone else relies on rental shops. Media is a specialty market, not a mass-market one, so prices have stayed astronomically high. 

The Japanese Otaku's desire to own anime even at high prices had an unexpected effect: as the rest of the economy tanked and video stores stopped buying every new video release, the otaku kept buying pretty much everything that got released. Before long, the few thousand fans that bought anime DVDs were supporting nearly the entire budget of a show. Even as the rest of the Japanese home video industry lowered their prices to varying degrees, anime stayed at the same high price. It's simply the only way most shows can ever make a profit. 




 Mr. Justice is a spammer.

This show is INSANE, INSANE, INSANE. The whole From Beyond thing being an elaborate hoax doesn't really explain the PM going all super saiyan.

 I feel the same. 




 I'm gonna be avoiding Sportcenter tonight, don't wanna see that ending again.

I wanted this win bad not just for the standings but for more momentum heading into the games against OKC and Indiana. 




 Fuck. Fuck. That fucking hurt. Fuck. 




 I wonder how much change the Wind Revolution brought. The class divide still seems to be prevalent and the end result was a transfer of power from one blue blood to another. 









 All of a sudden romcom love triangle. The absurdity is pretty entertaining.

 Eh? Nothing that has transpired so far made me think that she should die and that's the only way to end things. There's still so many unanswered questions about her role. 

Killing off a characters can be cliche also and if not done properly can be seen as a cheap attempt for a tear jerker. 









 The enemy has some faulty designed mechas lol.

Betrothed to his sister and now to a loli. Also with a cross dressing love interest on the side. Nobunaga is like Araragi with a mecha. 




 That's a fabulous pose. 














 The underwear song is pretty catchy. That Satan skit is pretty amusing, it got me with the "please deliver me from paper" line.  




 Damn, just reading this speculation hit right in the feels. 




 This show with its roller coaster ride of tonal shifts is playing with my emotions. 









 The bomber being linked to the teacher/bullying felt tacked on. This episode didn't do as good of a job as the first episode in terms of intertwining different cases together. 




 Usagi Drop, Honey Clover and Cross Game are all on Hulu. 




 [In the OP there's a little girl cuddled up with little Kal-el.](http://i.imgur.com/AOmivlF.jpg) Hmmm, I wonder if that's Claire. If that's true and she's also Nina Viento then this might get interesting.  




 I hope it avoids the imouto route but I guess it fits in with the insanity. Maybe the term "sister" means something else lol.

 The best they can do is being done already and that is being available on Crunchy, Hulu, Netflix and having some shows in toonami. Late night anime used to be available on cable TV like Sci-fi Channel and Tech-TV/G4 but those channels are niche. Even in those niche channels anime couldn't draw a decent enough audience to be kept on air.

The only anime that hit mainstream are children's shows like Pokemon, Digimon, DBZ and etc. That's back when children's shows in general were popular, when Kid's WB, Fox Kids and afternoon Toonami existed. Those days are long gone.

Non-sitcom animation for adults in general has always been niche. Archer is on a relevant cable network and in its four seasons has never reached 2 million viewers. If an American made animation of that type can't hit mainstream then anime doesn't have much of a chance



  




 Late night anime has always been niche. Obviously there has been a few exceptions like Eva, AoT, Haruhi, Madoka and a few others but for the most part the audience will always be limited due to the time slot. 




 Ononoki with that posed look. 




 Yeah, the slice of life stuff is a nice breather or palette cleanser in between the intense fights. 




 That's adorable. I'd watch a show about a girl and her pet alpaca.

 I enjoy the roller coaster ride but some of the transitionary episodes in between the tonal changes are a bit unexciting. 




 The humor is kind of dull but I see some potential due to the unique premise. Some comedy shows take some time to pick up steam like Gintama which took me about 3-5 episodes to really get into.

I'll give this the 3 episode treatment and if it improves I might keep watching. 




 Did the show just referenced Cross Game, because I think it did and it put a smile on my face.

 I like how the three jobs merged into one, I thought that was clever. The characters have a good dynamic between them which produced some really funny moments. Then of course, there's also the action and the music. Best premiere so far this season, looks like it's going to be a fun show.

Cross Game (series) - sports anime but the drama is excellent



 




 Watch The Princess and the Pilot, this series is a spin-off of that movie. It has the romance in the sky vibe that's a bit reminiscent of Laputa: Castle in the Sky. 




 The anime is [Anohana](http://www.hulu.com/anohana-the-flower-we-saw-that-day). The location is Chichibu. 




 man that romance was a little rushed with that "grab her as she falls ,stare into each others eyes and embrance" scene.

Yeah, that escalated way too quickly and came off kind of cheesey. A nice dialogue where they share a few laughs would have suffice in establishing the romance.

 









 Those CG mechs didn't look so good. The show's world building seems fairly interesting though. 




 I guess that was alright. The animation was great towards the end but the humor fell flat with the exception of the circle joke. 




 Kino's Journey season 2, please. 




 I was so happy when I noticed it's a double episode. The show sold Sawamura's bait pretty well. 
























 I also always liked the [imagery](http://www.reddit.com/r/Mushishi/comments/27977b/mushishi_episode_6_cinematography/) in Mushishi. 




 This felt like a mix between Harmonie and Chihayafuru. 




 That's most likely right. Ship sunk. 




 Aww, Daichi's lady friend has his jersey number as a key-chain. 




 I guess it could be argued that Machida should've turned it up earlier but I think the reason he was able to gain momentum was because Weidman started to fade in the 4th and couldn't apply the same amount of pressure. 




 That was endearing. I like how Naru's behavior put to light Handa's flaws to himself -- too prideful to apologize and too enclosed in his comfort zone.

Hopefully this turns out well since I've been itching for a SOL about an adult and they're rare to come by. 




 I'm pretty hyped about the super-duper awesome genius prodigies matching up against each other. 




 In this episode: exposition

Is this suppose to be a bad thing? Or do we really want things happening without a proper set-up and build-up a la Captain Earth.

I think the exposition was delivered well either through the flow of character interactions or background dialogue (radio). 




 Prior to the Royals there were the 2006 Diamondbacks with Justin Upton, Stephen Drew, Conor Jackson, Carlos Quentin, Carlos Gonzalez and Chris Young. Quentin and Gonzalez were used to get Haren. Their pitching prospects aren't worth mentioning hence the Haren trade.

2007 and 2011 were the only good years they had. D-backs and Royals show how fickle talent development could be. Even the Rays took years to figure it out. 









 It's freakin excellent. My AOTY last year and will go down as one of my all time favorites. I'm glad that this will give it a bit more exposure. 




 Crunchyroll webplayer definitely needs some work.

The PS3 app was absolutely horrendous a few months ago but after an update it has been fine. 




 Looks fine to me too. Better animation, better camera work, better effects.

 The OST is ace. [My favorite track.](http://youtu.be/1QR6LJuv6sc)

Also an underrated anime. The 1st season took a while to find its stride but the 2nd season was great and more than makes up for it. It had some of the most emotionally charged fight scenes I've seen. Also well choreographed and animated.
 




 They made four seasons of Natsume Book of Friends. 




 To me episode 18 was the turning point of the show. It turned from a funny show to a "I laughed so hard that my sides hurt" type of show. 




 I thought this might be Mushishi's version of a nature documentary but instead it's just Ginko getting swindled lol. I loved the folklore vibe of the whole episode.

Also Ginko walking around in circles reminded of episode 14, when he got lost in the bamboo forest. That episode was really sad.

 I feel there's been too many practice episodes. Some good, some just okay but it does get a bit monotonous. I think a change of scenery and activity while maintaining the volleyball-centric story would be a good palette cleanser. 




 Near the end of the last episode there was a short scene of Kaori sitting in the dark and her diary on her desk without anything new written on it. I thought that was ominous but it seems despite her set-back and all the negative memories coming back, Kaori is still bravely pushing forward. But now Hase...we need intervention! 




  Hase's just overthinking it as per usual

I think that's quite the opposite. He usually follow his emotions impulsively (with both negative and positive results). Right now he's feeling scared, so his instinctive response is to avoid the situation. If he actually thought things through he would've arrived to a logical conclusion that it's best for Kaori's recovery for them to stay "special" friends.  




 Rory seems like a nice guy and all but Rogan's constant verbal fellatio of him is really irritating and makes me want to see him get knocked out by Hendricks. 




 [Anime VS Real Life](http://m.imgur.com/a/AfIsv)

If you're an anime fan interested in cinematography: [link](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com) 




 I think I will upvote anything Gintama related. 




 So Sidonia did not encounter a Gauna for a hundred years. Then Nagate surfaces and almost right away a Gauna shows up.

The Captain predicted that the Council would want Nagate dead so she purposely navigated Sidonia into Gauna territory so she can sortie him and somewhat appease the Council. Although not ideal, this situation fits her strategy of defeating the Gauna instead of running away, with Nagate as her ace just like the way she pictured Hiroki should have been. This is also why she doesn't give a shit about the Kabi's attracting Gaunas.

Also I'm speculating Ochiai threw away the Kabis in order to force the Council to use his Gauna-Human hybrid as a weapon since it can kill Gaunas without a Kabi. 




 I'm more curious if the anime would boost the manga sales. It's a bit concerning that the older volumes didn't make the top 50 in the last few weeks of rankings. Unless they're not available.

 Those people need to experience cramping up. I don't care how mentally tough you are, you're not gonna will your body to move when cramps have immobilized it. 









 This episode has a such a gloomy feel to it. The same sort of melancholic feeling I get when I watch 5 cm per second.

Hase gets clean up duty. His crepe date then goes to hell. He loses special friends status. Fujimiya seems to have stopped writing in her diary. The street light then forebodingly flickers off on Hase. All of these happened in a span of one day.

Being Hase truly is suffering. 




 Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor. The second season exists, just accept it!


 




 The way Shaft used the song was underwhelming.

The story about Ayano and the orphans, the story of the Monster, the Snake's schemes and how Kano fits in all of this were awkwardly put together. There was no flow whatsoever.

I was hoping for a jigsaw puzzle story that would cleverly put the pieces together but with only three episodes left I would not get my hopes up that the show can pull that off. 
 




 The Captain's super secret facility needs to be more secretive.

I really like the sequence where as Tanikaze becomes a bigger hero so does his obsession with Guana Hoshijiro. The sliding glass barriers was a nice touch. This is a really well directed show. Hopefully, Kobun Shizuno gets more quality material to work with in the future.
 




 Nice character development. Been waiting for something like this, hopefully the show would build on it. The show is fun but a little bit of depth doesn't hurt.

Short supply of magic fuel seems like a sign of rationing for war. That's a nice touch and adds to the world building. 









 Watch the remake, Space Battleship Yamato 2199. It's amazing. 




 [Knights of Sidonia](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/05/knights-of-sidonia-episode-8.html). 




 First volume sold almost 6,000 in its first week. I was hoping for more but it actually still out-performed the [projected sales](http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1 hl=en ie=UTF8 nv=1 rurl=www.google.com sl=ja tl=en u=http://www27392u.sakura.ne.jp/show.cgi%3Fn%3DB00J2GGZ5C usg=ALkJrhgoECCiZRNruKB_hdEHEg-cIKnjvQ) based on the Amazon Ranking Stalker. The projected sales for the later volumes are higher but I dunno how accurate that is. 




 I think all the action scenes which there are plenty of, and some of the more important non-action scenes are animated at full 24 fps or done "on ones." The rest of the non-action stuff I think are done on twos with maybe the exception of the earlier episodes which are noticeably choppier. 




 [I think this epitomizes Hase's feelings at the end of this episode.](http://gfycat.com/HighRashClingfish) 




 The show is really pushing it with the teasing and the bait   switch romance. It's giving me Touch flashbacks. I should be bothered by it but the show is so damn heartwarming that the gimmick just comes off as amusing. 




 It's just part of the process, a painful one.

 AoT animation was even more inconsistent than KoS. The first half of that show was littered with stills and some of them out of context to the dialogue. There were even [unfinished](http://media.animevice.com/uploads/1/13547/659701-2hmdkci.jpg) portions and the studio [apologized](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-05-09/attack-on-titan-staff-apologizes-for-unfinished-episodes-on-3-stations) for some of them.

Also, in general, anime shows are animated in low framerates. We're talking about 8-12 fps or sometimes lower. KoS isn't really any worse than any anime in terms of FPS, it just looks more jarring when applied to CG. Just imagine any Pixar movie rendered at 8 fps and it would look more noticeable than most animes.

KoS's frame rate has gotten better though and action always looked fluid. 




 Only ones I know that were clear about couples having sex:

**NANA.** Also much of the romance centers around adults who are already in a relationship. It's great and much different than most romance animes, I highly recommend it.

**Otona Joshi no Anime Time.** Four different stories about four different women. It deals with adults so the themes are mature; single working woman, unhappy marriages, and dysfunctional family. 

**ef: a tale of memories.** Teen romance with the common anime trait of characters unable to commit. The characters are well written though.

There's also White Album 2 and Clannad. 




 "My only regret is that I have...LeBronitis"

-Lance Stephenson  




 Eh? I'm just making a general statement on the /a/ topic and not comparing the two communities. 




 ITT: couples who need to just fuck already

That's almost every anime with any sort of romance. 









 Emiru died because the admonition infection has spread. She was infected because of her deep feeling of despair and resentment. 














 I for one want Lance Stephenson to keep on talking. This is entertaining. 




 [Manga](/s "I didn't quite rage but it was definitely frustrating. I just hope there's a development in the characters that would justify hitting the reset button. I'm also wary of a possible love triangle involving Hajime. I wouldn't mind using him to push Hase in the right direction but I don't want a drama built around a love triangle") 




 Dammit Hase just admit to yourself that you like her. I guess Shogo is going to have to coax it out of him, like always.

This episode set things up so well, much better than the manga. [Manga Spoiler](/s "What happens next is really going to hurt. It would also really frustrate some people since with only four episodes left we most likely won't see a payoff that would justify such a huge setback")

 




 Hinata's energy gets me hyped up. I really like how most of the characters play off of that energy or just with each other in general.

This episode did sports speeches really well. Those speeches a lot of the time feel obligatory and contrived just like they did in Episode 4. In this episode they felt really natural and flowed with the story and dialogue. 

Also the OST if amazing.

[This sequence at end was great](http://imgur.com/a/3JNtj). 




 Stephenson is averaging almost 44 min/game. The guy is being run ragged. 




 Tatsuya being ludicrously OP and amazing at everything is weirdly entertaining and amusing. 




 The nightmares that Shintaro seems to be having are the intros in Episode 1 and 5, the ones with him and Ayano talking.

Also we finally get a connection between the "Monster" and the rest of the cast. The teacher, who's also Ayano's father seems to be involved also. Maybe they're the family?

Eternity seems to be a theme here. The monster is immortal, Ene woke up in a body that's practically immortal, Haruka seems to have been granted an immortal body and Ayano seems to exists in a time and space where she's eternal. 




 I love the use of rain as an analogue for her tears. The parallel between the drifter mushi and Teru's life was also an elegant analogy. Mushishi really excels at these type of things.

There's some awkward editing in this episode though. The way the flashbacks were done was a bit jarring. 









 We finally get the overall picture of the show which is to rebuild in the Rem star system but the Captain thinks it's not that simple. Looks like the political/social turmoil will get fleshed out more with the departing ceremony. 

Man, the cinematography and editing in this show is absolutely top notch. It even managed to make the death scene look beautiful.

[Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/aoeFH)

 




 In the flashback in Episode 2 when as a kid Smile said he wanted to be like Peco, I don't think he meant in terms of skill and talent. I don't think he saw him as a hero in that way either. I think for him, to be like Peco is to love and enjoy Ping Pong. Smile probably did enjoy Ping Pong but as he watched Peco's passion for the sport fade way so did his enjoyment along with it.

What I think Smile is playing for and chasing after is that enjoyment for the sport that he used to share with Peco. 




 They're missing out. The attention to detail in terms of background art, hud displays, UI displays, the wear and tear on equipments and suits is superb. The cinematography, editing, music, sound effects, the action and just the overall direction has been excellent and not just for an anime but in general. 




 Eh. You're missing out, I love the murder mystery vibe of Mononoke. 




 This episode was hilarious. I totally did not expect this show to pull off something like this. I'm a bit lukewarm to Akira and Toru but some more comedy would really add some much needed charisma to these characters. 














 The animation in the last scene when Tina, Enju and Kisara were hugging was silky smooth. As opposed to the action scenes which were mainly made up of cut in-cut aways, quick match cuts and close ups in order to hide limited animation.

A cute scene featuring lolisaction scenes. This show knows its priorities. 









 Spoilers, obviously.

 Agreed on Heito and the mad scientist. The whole hysterically evil act is so tired. They really bring down the show, which is unfortunate since the rest of it have improved since episode two.

If you really like the aspect of a supernatural being born out of despair and tragedy then you should really watch the Mononoke tv series (unrelated to the Ghibli movie). 




 [Manga spoiler](/s "Five episodes should be more than enough to cover at least up to chapter 16. Although, I doubt five episodes is enough to resolve that arc. So Season 1 most likely won't have a closure but with good execution it could still feel satisfying albeit with some uncertainty.")

[](/s "I just really hope they don't go the route of using filler episodes and then use Chapter 14 as a cliff hanger ending. The would really suck.")

[](/s "As for the memory loss, yeah that hurt but it was more so frustrating. The relationship between the two was progressing so well despite Hase's wishy-washiness being slightly irritating, then all of sudden we're back to square one. At least Hase seems be showing good growth out of it, with the way he's handling things so far")
 




 Aww! They didn't do Fujiyama's internal monologue during the study scene that was in the manga. I guess it makes sense in terms of pacing the characters, and also consistency since most of the anime is told in Hase's perspective. But still, I really liked that moment. 




 The chemistry between Hinata, Kageyama and Tanaka is great. Their interactions remind me of Ippo, Takmura, Aoki and Kimura. 




 The 256 Gardes dissolve formation sequence looked great. The memorial scene was well shot too. 

[Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/CSSGs) 




 I think the surprise more has to do with how it was executed. The flash forward was so unexpected that it might have caught people off guard which made the death reveal shocking despite the deathflags.

 Kawaii. 




 Both teams played hard. 




 The drama has somewhat been more nuanced in the last two episodes which is a big improvement but it also made the wacko character types like the Scientist and Heito stick out like a sore thumb. I wish those characters didn't exist, since they're off setting any consistency that could be established.

 I clicked on the link expecting Kondo. Slightly disappointed that it wasn't him. Only slightly because boobs. 




 That was...that was actually kind of good. The episode did a good job of making the characters intriguing, I feel like this is how the show should've started instead of bombarding the audience with too many dramatics. I'm still not getting my hopes up but this will keep me watching. 




 The sweetness of this show is turning me into molasses. 




 That was a nice and laid back team building episode.

I also like that the show rarely resorts to character stills with just moving mouths during dialogues. There's always little body language animation the makes the characters feel alive.  




 I'm curious about how this show will tie everything together. This could end up a disjointed mess or a unique and cleverly told story. Either way this is a type of show that requires patience and the audience to let things unravel instead of expecting the storyline to be laid out in every episode.

Hopefully the saying "The whole is greater than the sum of the parts" rings true for this show.

There's a difference between institutionalized discrimination and personal bigotry. They seemed to be fighting against the latter when the former is far more important. The former could be changed with progressive policies while the latter can't.

Obviously bigotry is not OK but like Mayumi said you can't change what an individual feels by force.  









 I guess those Gardes are worth more than civilian lives and structural damage. As cold as it sounds it kind of makes sense since they're the only line of defense and must be used as a last resort. Even just losing 1/8 of their Gardes would be a huge blow and that's with very little guarantee that the Guana won't get through. So if the option to evade is there then it's probably the best option most of the time.

Still pretty ballsy and quick risk assessment by the Captain.

I didn't expect to experience such an intense space battle so soon after Yamato 2199. What a great surprise.

Also gotta love the detail and design on those graphic displays, UI, and flight instruments. It's the little things that create the space sci-fi atmosphere. 




 The dark tone in this episode is so contrived; the blood licking, the random murderous character, and the mystery mecha inexplicably located in a hospital basement. Still, I'm morbidly curious about this show so I'll keep watching. 




 Don't worry they'll go back to not caring about basketball once they're eliminated. 




 Bullshit double tech. It's just the refs making up for the missed foul on Val. 




 Too many monologues and speeches crammed into one episode which undermined Sugawara's characterization. I feel like that was an excessive amount of set-up just to initiate the chemistry between Kageyama and Hinata. 




 At first I was worried about the jealousy angle but the episode fortunately didn't dwell on it and merely used it as a cause of conflict. And the dialogue was good enough that it came off as a natural reaction from a young man who's in love. Although, I still would've preferred if the show used something less cliche and convenient.

I also really liked how vague they are about the diary during the riverside conversation. It expresses how unsure they are on how to handle the situation but both know how important it is to them. I think that really made the resolution all the more gratifying. 




 The moment the fingers make contact with the eyes it should be called a poke, the ref shouldn't wait for the opponent to get hurt. I mean, they don't ignore a low blow shot even if it didn't affect the fighter, same logic should be applied here. 




 You forgot to add that they're a bunch of screwdrivers playing Monster Hunter. It always amazes how Sorachi comes up with these crazy ideas and make them work. 




 Even one cour shows need 2-3 episodes to set things up. 

I'm finding this "plot development in 3 episodes or bust" mentality among some anime fans to be silly. It's an initial approach that promotes needless impatience and an entitlement for instant gratification. 




 And now we have a big breasted Christmas cake character. This show is just hitting all the otaku-bait staples.

I love the high-brow stuff like Mushishi and Ping Pong and the more subtle drama like One Week Friends but sometimes I just like to sit back and enjoy wacky shows like this one. 




 These muggles are so salty. 




 The pacing seems fine for a 26 episode season. First three episodes set up the characters, magical setting, student council and the awkward take on discrimination. This episode introduced the possible conflict with the anti-magic terrorist group, it's pretty obvious that's where the plot is going. 




 So many good passes are wasted on Asik. 




 DeRozan got the 2006 Finals Wade treatment. 




 This episode gave me a "The Most Dangerous Game" vibe and a little bit of "The Birds" vibe towards the end. Good stuff. 




 CG also allows the animators to have more freedom with the camera work since the camera is operating in 3d. In 2d they redraw all the different angles which is a lot more work. The amount of camera angles, transitions, and different POVs that we saw in this show's action scenes are something you're rarely going to see in 2d animation.

Also I really like the lighting and shadowing in this show, again something hard to pull off in traditional animation.

Hopefully CG in anime keeps improving, variety is a good thing. 




 I actually want to see Kunato try to pilot the Type 17 and possibly make a fool of himself. According to that little bit of exposition the Type 17 demands more from the pilot since the computer system isn't as advanced. 




 The framerate is up and down. 1st episode I thought it was ok, 2nd episode it was really distracting and 3rd episode it's ok-ish. Overall I think the show looks great.

I didn't expect all of them to die. Even though someone dying was predictable I thought it was executed well. The voices of panic and everyone's composure unraveling were pretty convincing. 




 He doesn't have to commit and it might remain that way but I'm just pointing it out that it's a weakness.

Throwing a game is disrespectful to the opponent since it belittles their effort and pride. I highly doubt Kong would appreciate being pitied like that. 




 Tsukimoto's strong sympathy for his opponents is a big weakness but equally so is his view of ping pong as something inconsequential to him. Even if he can become a stonecold player there's really not much that drives him to win, after all this is just a hobby to him. Once he meets his match talentwise he wouldn't have as much resolve as someone who loves the sport, committed to excellence and have a strong will to win.

Weirdly enough Tsukimoto reminds me of Nodame (a pianist) from Nodame Cantabile. Both are talented at their craft but for differing reasons they have trouble committing to it and seeing it as more than a hobby. 




 I really wish this didn't go the amnesia route. We already have a series with the same "mysterious powerful girl" setup that uses amnesia as a plot device.

The interaction between the three is starting to grow on me and inserting some world building gives the show a sense of adventure. 




 Why the fuck is there a case of mass destruction inside a Gastrea?

Also, some of these scenes are put together well with decent enough dialogue but the overacted voice acting spoil these scenes. The screaming and wailing can be a bit grating which is a shame since I like how the show is building up the bond between Rentaro and Enju. 




 Grizz had to beat both the Thunder and Lady Luck 




 Yeah, a bit heavy handed with the character emotions and motives. It's going with the old "angsty MC with a tragic past" concept; nothing wrong with that but the portrayal was way too straightforward and unrefined. Despite all of that, I didn't mind the first episode, it was effective in establishing the dark tone albeit a bit forceful, and it did enough to piqued my interest.

Hopefully the drama doesn't get too overbearing and the show would let it breath. I haven't seen much of Okada's work but she's been criticized for overdone melodrama, so I'm crossing my fingers here. I really really liked Anohana though, melodrama aside. 









 I know anime fans love to complain about MCs in romance shows being wish-washy and beating around the bush but this one is quite the opposite. The relationship feels rushed and unearned, and lacks chemistry. The show hasn't done enough with the dialogue and circumstances to build a feeling of genuine bond between the two. 




 Werdum really turned it on after Browne taunted him. Then Werdum proceeded to taunt Browne for three rounds. 




 Gotta commend Tatsuya for his composure when Miyuki was working her "charms." If I were in his place...ummm I might start questioning my moral values lol.

This has all the makings of a fun guilty pleasure show; overpowered MC, imouto fetishism, nonsense jargon, awkward take on discrimination, and good action. 




 Finally a three. 




 Andersen you idiot. 




 I love Eagle, WTF am I doing watching the ESPN broadcast.
