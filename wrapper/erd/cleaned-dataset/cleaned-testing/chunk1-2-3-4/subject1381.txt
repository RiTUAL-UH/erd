Topic: Wellspring

Transcript of Recording

Subject #2907: Id like to start with where I think it began. You know, the cassette?

Martin Howard: Sure, why not. Just let me update your status first.

Subject #2907: You werent recording that?

Martin Howard: I just didnt want you to feel pressured, like you had to put on a facade. [clears throat] Patient [NAME REDACTED]

Subject #2907: Please, doc. If you could include my status after I have already left, Id appreciate it.

MH: Well, its like I said earlier - although we can acknowledge that the paranoia exists, we shouldnt give in to it.

2907: I know, I know, but could you just humor me this once?

MH: Alright. So, then, start with the cassette.

2907: Well, as you know, [NAME REDACTED] and I read about geocaching and decided to try it out. Theres so much potential in that area. Its all so wide open, uncharted, beautiful...in places like that, theres bound to be hidden shit. 

MH: Right, of course. Go on.

2907: So, we spent the week doing just that. We didnt find much, just trinkets, really. Kinda seemed like people kept getting caught up in the adventure and forgot to bring stuff to replace it with. So they just tossed out whatever their pockets happened to be carrying. [laughter] We found a penny from the seventies, an empty lighter, things like that. We wouldve been bored with it, if people hadnt made it so damn hard to find.

MH: Thats the point, isnt it? From what youve told me.

2907: Yeah, it is. So we didnt mind. But then we finally came across our first big find. Something that wasnt junk. It was a VHS tape in this tin can that looked old as fuck. I was kind of bummed at first, because there was enough damage on the actual film that I didnt think it would be playable. But I decided to try it out anyway, and after dropping [NAME REDACTED] at home so she could go to work, I popped it into my old DVD/VHS combo.

MH: So, [NAME REDACTED] wasnt around when you saw this? I thought you said she was.

2907: No, no, I just said I felt like I wasnt alone when I watched it. Like there was someone there with me.

MH: Someone like God?

2907: Definitely not. More like I felt like someone was watching me. Shit, I hope God wouldnt make me feel like that.

MH: Why did the tape make you feel this way? What was on it?

[long pause]

2907: You sure I have to repeat this? I thought we talked about it before, when it was recording -

MH: [talking over Subject] We did, but I actually didnt have it recording then, and I figured it would be better to get it now, now that your memories of the incident are a little more clear.

2907: Alright. It, uh, didnt really have anything at first. Just some static-y darkness, like when you first start a VHS, but before the actual film? And then, with those VHS blocked letters, it said 5:55 AM. Then, right under it, it said, SNOW in capital letters. And then the text went away and it showed this snow covered place. It was still lightly sprinkling snow, and you could tell it was late at night. The clouds were doing that thing when it snows, where it just forms one big mass? And no moonlight can get through? So the streetlights and whatnot reflect off it. I liked it before then.

MH: Where exactly was this video taking place?

2907: Near this one intersection. But, remember, there was a shitload of snow and no tire tracks or footprints or anything anywhere. It was a pretty even layer, and I remember that area usually being pretty heavy with traffic, regardless of the time of day -

MH: So youve been to this area before?

2907: Well, yeah. Kind of hard not to, being that its right next to [REDACTED]. I didnt recognize it right away because of the all the snow, but as soon as I did, the camera sort of panned downward and then behind. This person was walking barefoot through ankle-deep snow, maybe higher, and the only sign of, you know, life, were her set of footprints that seemed to go on for miles. Then it came back to the persons point of view, facing their surroundings again, and I noticed [REDACTED] had all of their lights off and appeared closed, which I thought was really weird.

MH: Arent they usually open twenty-four hours?

2907: Yeah, thats what made it so weird.

MH: Maybe they were constructing it at the time.

2907: But they had all of their advertisements up, and it looked the same as it does now, just dark and sort of abandoned. 

MH: Okay, that is strange. Continue.

2907: So this person walks a little longer, almost to the intersection, and they just stop. It was sorta peaceful, like you could hear the snow softly falling, and this persons even breathing. I listened closely to see if I could hear any traffic, just any background noise, and I turned my TV volume all the way up, but I couldnt hear any signs of it. Thats when they turned the camera on themselves.

MH: And who was this person?

2907: You already know. Dont get why youre -

MH: Im just trying to get every detail down.

2907: ...It was me. And I dont mean like Hey, she could pass off as me! or Wow, we have similar features! No, it was me, like I was looking in the mirror. And I was smiling super wide, like I was excited or trying to take a ridiculous picture of myself. They - she - I, I guess? They got the camera pretty close to their face, or my face, and I could see that my gums were bleeding. And all you could see was my mouth when they said, They know about you now. 

MH: They know about you now?

2907: Yeah, thats all she said.

MH: Do you know what they mightve meant?

2907: Nope, havent got a clue. But after she said it she pulled the camera back to show my whole face, and grinned even wider before turning the camera off. 

MH: Was that the end of the tape?

2907: I think so. Kind of. It tried to show some other sort of text, but that mustve been where the tape was most corroded because I couldnt make it out. And then there was a blurry shot of a street name, or a building name, maybe [REDACTED].

MH: I see. Well, what did you think of it?

2907: Are you serious? What the fuck was I supposed to think? It freaked me the fuck out. I called [REDACTED] but then remembered she was at work, so I hung up and texted her. 

MH: Before we move on to what happened next, I just want to clarify a few things. Do you have any memories of recording this tape?

2907: Of course not. Why else would it have freaked me out? Pretty sure I wouldnt be here if I did remember it.

MH: I know it seems pointless, [REDACTED], but I just want to get everything on the record.

2907: Who the fuck cares if its on the record? It doesnt matter anyway, seeing as it everyone keeps saying it didnt happen. If it didnt, why do you keep questioning me?

MH: Im sorry, [REDACTED], you have a valid point. Why dont we give it a break for today? Okay?

2907: Yeah, okay.

MH: I want you to really try to get your memories in order, though, so we can accurately document this. This will be important to your case. Just remember that.

2907: Ill try. But I honestly just want a break from thinking about it.

MH: Then let it come naturally. Just keep in mind that the sooner we are able to identify your problem, the sooner you can be out of here. Lets work on that. Okay?

2907: Okay. 

MH: Have a good day, [REDACTED]. Go ahead and ask for some water on your way back.

2907: Alright. Later.

Hey, Will. Sorry for taking forever to get back to you, I was searching the evidence room for the journal. Again. Its been gone for weeks though, and I doubt well find it in this  building. The tapes still dont show anyone leaving the room with any object that hasnt already been accounted for. 

I still have the online copy Mary made, though, so itll have to suffice. Not sure why you need it right now, but Im sure youll tell me later. Are we still down for Saturday? You havent replied yet and Amys getting on my ass. 

Anyway, have a good night. Call me later.

*September 21st, 2013*

If you find this, please dont try to figure out where I am. Take this and run. Destroy it if you make it home alive. Make sure no one ever knows of our legacy.

I know now that there is no god, but for gods sake, burn any trace you can.

All you need to know is that this is our birthright. This is humanitys womb and bones.

 nbsp;

*September 14th, 2013*

We have to find a way out. There has to be an end. We could always see either side, but we never got any closer. Not until last night.

We stuck with one direction, and for the first time, I think were actually making progress. I think were getting closer to the other side.

Well spent one more night in this forsaken tunnel, but after that, well be free. I know we will.

 nbsp;

*September 12th, 2013*

We cant get out. It doesnt make sense. We spent three days walking back and forth in the tunnel. It doesnt matter which side we go to - the exit only becomes farther and farther. Three days spent walking until the blood in our shoes made it nearly impossible, screaming until our ears rang for hours, sobbing until there was nothing left. Three days worth of stomping on that picture, over and over again, trying to deny its existence. It was only a short time ago that she finally ripped it apart. Now, we dont have to think about it anymore. Now, there is only the future.

The horrible, agonizing, unending future.

 nbsp;

*September 10th, 2013*

There was a picture in the middle of the tunnel

It was [scratched out, unintelligible]

Who couldve taken that picture?? WHO

I can feel its eyes

 nbsp;

*September 9th, 2013*

For the first time in days, maybe weeks, I feel hope. We found the tunnel! We have to be getting closer now. I still dont see the road, and the area around the tunnel is just more trees, more forest, but thats okay. She said we might be able to find the road on the other side of the tunnel. I know there was a parking lot nearby that side. It cant be much farther now.

Now that Ive got a grasp of hope, Im not letting it go. 

 nbsp;

*September 8th, 2013*

I cant let that happen again. No. I was so scared and mad, and for what? Not like it did us any good. We probably became even more lost thanks to our hysterics. But I think Ive got control of myself now. The actual time part of my watch is broken - its stuck on 8:27 AM - but the date continues to work, so I know how many days have passed. Its easy to lose count of the sunrises and sunsets. 

We have nothing. They kept everything when they let us go. Our camp gear, our individual possessions, everything has been taken. I hid this book in a safe spot, out in the woods, and it was still there when we were released.

Weve been hiding. I know they told us we could only leave if they couldnt find us, but I dont know if they really meant it. We cant hike forever. 

I write whenever we take breaks. I write instead of sleeping a lot of the time. I found that two hours is just enough rest to keep me sane.

She doesnt say much of anything anymore. Only what she needs to say. I only see her cry when she stares into the fire. I dont know if she knows I can see.

We have to make it out.

 nbsp;

[Undated Entry]

They said theyd let us go. They said! Theyd let! Us GO! And here we are, circling and circling these damn woods. These damn goddamn fucking WOODS! CIRCLING AND CIRCLING AND CIRCLING AND

I hateyou! You said youd let us go! Why the fuck did you L I E? How could you? I know youre hiding us, and I know youre hiding!

 nbsp;

*September 4th, 2013*

Were getting deeper. We found a craggily rock that looked over the tiny creek and sat there for a while. It was starting to get dark, but it felt like the sun was doing us a favor, stretching out its light for as long as it could. It was 7:05 PM but still just a bit past sunset. We really shouldve been setting up camp while it was still light, but we procrastinated, just talking. I dont know why; there isnt much we dont already know about each other. We werent saying anything important, just blabbering about various nature facts and some funny things that happened to us weeks ago. I keep getting the impression that shes trying to put off saying something.

I wonder if shes afraid well die. I mean, obviously she was, but I wonder if that feeling is still there. I want to curl into her fear and make myself at home. Her fear would comfort me, because it meant that she still loves me. Loves herself.

 nbsp;

*September 3rd, 2013: Part 2*

Were here now. Weve been making various signs and symbols for ourselves so we can find our way back more easily. Its mostly just killing time until we actually go into the forest. 

Im going to try to write as we go. Our phones still just barely work, so I need this to keep me from going insane. Im not going to go crazy.

I know this is a terrible idea, but I dont know what else we couldve done. We just want the nightmares to end.

Heading out.

 nbsp;

*September 3rd, 2013*

Were going. Theres no doubt about it.

She woke up screaming my name. I tried to comfort her, which turned into her comforting me. We sat in bed, clutching each other, crying and trying to not look around the room. Every light that still worked in the apartment was turned on, but we never left the bed. After a while we thought we heard the sound of a metal screen door opening and closing. We dont have one.

The morning after she said we didnt have a choice. We need to go. We need to figure out why this thing wont let us go. We need to see what it wants us to see. I was too tired to argue, and didnt speak up until after she threatened to go without me.

I dont want her to leave me here.

Were planning on spending at least one night out there. Its already half passed three and I know we wont have enough daylight. Still, shes packing like were going to be gone for weeks. I keep asking her Why pack this? Why pack that? hoping shell admit to something, but she always replies, Just in case. 

Ive been hiding in the bathroom to cry, but were still sticking to our rules and never let either of us be alone for more than two minutes and forty-two seconds. I dont want her to know how afraid I truly am.

I started a different journal, just in case. I burned the old one, just in case. Now Ill never have to see it looking at me through my dotted Is again. 

Weve got the last of our gear. Time to go.
