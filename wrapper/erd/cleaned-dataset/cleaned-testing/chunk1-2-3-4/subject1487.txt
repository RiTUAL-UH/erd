 Clearly they don't. 




 I'm surprised my gf doesn't do that, honestly. 




 Same kind of thing on Jenova. Bots are kinda creepy, IMO. 




 I played a few months before my SO, and she just got into the game about a month or so ago. She enjoys playing it, which surprised me. Since we are just getting into a long-distance relationship since she moved for University, she decided to play it so that we have something to do together; and now she's obsessed with Moogles. Go figure.

I think that if you can, you should tell her to at least try it. I agree with some of the things that people said in here, at least in terms of trying it. As the saying goes, "don't knock it 'til you try it." 




 Forever haunting your dreams... 




 What's up, BTBAM! Been listening to you guys for the last couple years or so when a friend of mine introduced me to Colors! I was amazed that I hadn't listened to you guys beforehand, and now I'm a huge fan! 

When you guys write, do you write everything out in a music notation program? And if you do, how much of it is already completed by the time you start writing all of it out?  




 Waiting on my blu-ray! This sounds so good! 




 Boss as fuck. 
























 Pardon me if I'm wrong, I haven't studied Theory intensely in awhile. I believe it's just a color tone, but the bV would make the chord half diminished. You can resolve it the same way you resolve any normal V chord, or use it as the Dominant of a new key.  




 My gf has wanted this since they announced it. 




 This is fantastic! 




 Amazing. 




 Can't explain to you how many times I've done this... 




 This is hilarious. Someone needs to make these an actual thing. Only cereal I'd buy. 




 This sounds like me and my SO, honestly. 




 I almost forgot to mention that I play a few hours out of the week, but that's because I need to stay on top of my schoolwork. It's tough because I can play this game all day long (as I did this last summer when I wasn't working and played this game for 4-8hrs a day every couple of days or so), but there are some points where I need to go do other things and hang out with RL people. 

Speaking of relationships, how goes the positive approach on yours? I hope it's going well. 
























 What if you tank better drunk? 




 Oh just wait! 




 Oh God, this scene. D: 




 By higher level I meant 50 on. Should've clarified: I'm aware Shield Oath and Shield Lob both help increase hate, but I've never been particularly good at keeping hate 100% of the time (which I know is impossible, but I need to humor the idealist in me). Flash, as was previously mentioned, only does so much, but I really needed I think to utilize rotating through targets more. Usually I just spam Flash/Halone combo/circle of scorn -- then provoke on any enemies that aren't in range of Flash, but it doesn't always work, and whenever I'm not Tanking I always notice those tanks who more or less keep Aggro 95% of the time.  




 Hey guys,


I was curious on how to maintain aggro most of the time in the higher level dungeons. Lately I've been having issues maintaining it, and spamming Flash isn't necessarily the best strategy. Would it be best to alternate between targets that you are attacking in order to maintain aggro? I've never really been completely sure of how exactly to go about this. Nobody I've queued with has really complained about it, but I've been wanting to learn to maintain it firmly. 




 I've noticed from experimenting and using Fracture as a PLD that it's really not all that useful, so I am scrapping that. All of the comments here are quite helpful, so thanks!  




 Whoops, you're right! For some reason I was envisioning an A minor7 b5 in my head and didn't think in terms of a Major key.  




 Hey guys, so I have an i90 PLD and am in the process of leveling my MRD for cross-class abilities. Which ones should I go for? Are there any other abilities that would be beneficial to the PLD job? 
























 While Tanking during Titan EX with my FC, getting repeatedly blasted off the platform by Landslide. Needless to say, my FC thought it was hilarious as I screamed myself into oblivion on Mumble every time.  




 Yes, welcome to Final Fantasy! :D My first month wasn't as progressive as I have college and work, but I do enjoy what time I can spend in Eorzea. :)  




 Damn, getting blasted off the platform during Titan EX must mean you're REALLY unconscious, then. 




 I absolutely hate speedrunning and will refuse to do it unless I'm partying with people that I am friends with. I like enjoying the dungeon for what it is regardless of how many times I have to run through it (unless it's AV. Fuck that place).  Granted, I understand people's want for speedruning, but I don't enjoy the process of speeding through something.  




 I never thought about it until now, but I myself am now anxious for a train to be patched. 




 10/10, made my day. 




 I play through Steam often, and the Mog Station simply registers your copy of the game under Windows. If you purchase the game through the Steam client,  it should give you a CD key that you affiliate with your SQ account in order to lock it to that account. 
As for buying time,  you can just pay though a credit/debit  card through the Mog Station as well. You should be able to redeem your time card in the same fashion. Purchasing a copy of the game would be necessary though,  as others have said.  




 Those players are all asshats, wow.
