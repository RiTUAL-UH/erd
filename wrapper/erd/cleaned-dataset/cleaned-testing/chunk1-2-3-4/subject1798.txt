 Forget the ads unless you want to compete against a hundred other applicants. No matter how good you are, if you're coming off the street you're going to get lost in the pile.

Instead, identify 5 companies you want to work for. Think about what you are actually **qualified** to do, even if the only thing may be to push a broom and scrub a toilet. Try to find out an important person in that department and arrange a 15 minute meeting with them. Almost everyone will give 15 minutes to somebody who shows initiative.

Now, you have to know what they're looking for, and know something about the culture of the company. Do your research. Explain to them why their company is a fit for you and vice versa. 

If you get the job, remember 3 things:

1. Show up 5 minutes early.
2. Do something every day that isn't asked of you.
3. Stay 5 minutes late.

 I would. You'll have plenty of chances to drink KJ at parties and weddings. When you are searching for yourself, try something different. Those vineyards are trying to make a name for themselves so you might discover a real gem. I have a friend who is an excellent sommelier. He started a winemaking operation a few years ago and just released his second vintage, a 2013 sauvignon blanc, for $16.99. He put a TON of time into getting it just right for him. 




 It's always a gamble, whether at $15 or at $100. I think what you enjoy is very personal. My wife and I have very different tastes but neither is "wrong." What I like about $15 is that I'm not out a whole bunch if the wine makes me say "meh." 




 It depends on the vintner. Some $20 bottles might as well be $8. But for more reputable small-batch vintners, a $20 wine probably has a little higher quality of production. The sugars are monitored more closely to determine harvest, the destemming is more thorough, the blending is a little more deliberate to create more complexity and balance that the winemaker is seeking, and it's probably aged a little more and perhaps finish-fermented in oak or cement. 









 Thank you, Ohio State, for showing why we needed a playoff. 




 Urban Meyer has always been a gambler. We'll see if it bites him in the butt this time.

 At the end of the day, it's still about viewership for ESPN and the SEC can deliver that better than any other conference. 




 **This** is why we've needed a CFB playoff. Because OSU obviously deserves a chance to make it to the championship game. 




 Damn, Alabama is the best tackling team I've ever seen in CFB. 




 start delayed to 9 pm EST. 




 Ohio State is the only team that will give Oregon a game. Alabama would get steamrolled. 




 You will get your wish. And you will regret it. There is no school in the SEC that is prepared for the Oregon offense. It's one thing to watch film and come up with a game plan. It's a completely different thing to be on the field. 




 FSU defenders not used to defending an option. You gotta make a decision. You can't be undecided. 




 Now let's just hope for no injuries. Ducks deserve to play the championship game at full strength. Well played, Oregon. 




 Exactly. Keep your team in the game mentally. If you don't convert a 4th down, the game is over. That was not the time to make that decision. That's a last-5 minute kind of decision. 




 I can not believe the coach was willing to put the entire game on the line in the 3rd quarter. How much is FSU paying him?? 




 When a coach makes a call like that, they're telling their team that they are panicking. Dumb decision. 




 FSU deserved to lose after that stupidest decision of the entire year of any coach. 




 No way. They are risking the entire game in the 3rd quarter? Dumb decision. Bad decision. Take 3. 




 That was seriously an awesome play. FSU defense has never seen an offense like this. Class is in session for FSU. 




 Oh boy, now the ball goes back to Oregon with time left for them to score. 




 FSU can definitely move the ball on Oregon. They're just not sharp inside the 20. 




 Cry me a river. Fucking white people.

 Correct rule, wrong interpretation. You should round down to 20.  




 The rule is half plus seven.  




 A progressive tax does not necessarily eliminate the incentive to having higher income unless it's up near 100%. There is, of course, a curve--The Laffer Curve. All economic models show that a progressive tax will produce the most tax revenue while still enjoying economic productivity.

In the 50s and 60s, the United States enjoyed a tremendous boost in productivity and wealth yet the top tax rates (for the top 0.1%) are almost double what they are today. 




 No tax targets only the area in which a corporation or individual is based. It all goes into a pile and is apportioned. To look at taxes as being earmarked would lead to a gross misunderstanding of the federal revenue and apportionment system of the United States.

Second, corporations do not benefit themselves. They are set up to benefit individuals, from wage earners to shareholders. By shifting the corporate tax burden to individuals, you can more accurately tax the benefit that the individual receives.

Third, eliminating the corporate tax also eliminates the incentive for keeping profits overseas and brings more money back into the U.S. where it helps Americans, rather than helping foreign economies. 




 If you ask economists, some of the proposals that almost all of them agree on would include:

* Eliminate corporate taxes - companies can reinvest more money into their businesses and create more jobs.
* Eliminate mortgage interest deduction - this deduction distorts the housing market and tends to give more benefit to wealthier people.

There are others but these are the two biggest ones off the top of my head. 




 As others have already stated, Duverger's Law is at work here. The "winner takes all" system practically guarantees that up to half of a district's citizens will be disenfranchised. I see it as a major reason for today's voter apathy.

 Glucose is a monosaccharide, meaning that its a single sugar molecule. It's pretty much the only thing cells burn for fuel. You are right that when you eat glucose, it goes directly into the blood to be used by your cells. Fructose heads to the liver where it's metabolized into lipids (fat). Here's where you went off track:  sucrose is a disaccharide, meaning it has two sugar molecules bonded together. Sucrose is 50/50 glucose and fructose. HFCS is 55% fructose, 41% glucose so the two really aren't that different. It's best to get your glucose from grains and avoid sugar altogether.  




 "You can be whatever you want to be."  Bullshit.  




 I had an awesome BK experience a couple of days ago. I put in my order for 2 whopper combos and I watched as my cashier overfill the French fry holders (what are they actually called, anyways?). He actually pounded the scooper and holder on the counter to get as many fries into the holder as he could. Then, after putting the fries and burgers in the bag, he took the scooper and dumped a bunch more fries into the bag. That has never happened before and may never happen to me again.

 There are a lot of social and financial factors at play. Essentially this is the result of cheap, easy debt and the 30 year mortgage. The price of something is set by how much somebody is willing to pay. If somebody is willing to spend 30 years paying for something and are able to get a loan with a monthly payment of upwards of 35% of their gross earnings, it will likely drive up the price of that item. And because the fed keeps the lending rate so low, banks can charge lower interest rates on mortgages. Does that mean people will lower their mortgage payments or be willing to pay a higher principal for homes? The latter. Again, this drives up the price of homes. 

But that money comes from some other part of the economy. Food, clothes, vacations, retail goods. All of these suffer.

 The ratio of the national debt to the U.S. GDP isn't high compared to historic levels. 

The idea is that a free or low cost education would be incentive for more people to get post-high school degrees, thereby attracting companies with a smarter, more capable workforce. This in turn would increase salaries and result in higher tax revenues. 




 Yes, and thanks for a better explanation than mine. 




 My response assumes you're referring to the U.S. economy.

The U.S. borrows at an incredibly low interest rate, in the tenths of percent. That's because the creditworthiness of the U.S. is high. People like buying U.S. debt because it's a safe place to park their money.

The U.S. gets enormous benefit from this. Let's say you make a really cool widget out of your garage. By yourself you make one a day. A rich uncle is willing to loan you $500,000 at 0.15% interest. You can use that money to buy more equipment, hire and train workers. Now you are earning 10X or 100X what you were earning before, AND employing people. That's a multiplier effect on your GDP. You'd be stupid not to take the money.

The U.S. uses debt to build roads, networks, satellites and pays for research that benefits everyone, and a military to protect all of it. In other words, that debt helps the producers produce more in a safe and fairly well regulated market.

 This example is about lying after receiving immunity. Maybe not exactly what you're looking for? You may not get charged with making a false statement if you have more serious charges in front of you, but it wouldn't look good for you if the case made it to court.

11th Circuit Court of Appeals: 
*Giving a false statement is an independent criminal act that occurs when the individual makes the false statement; it is separate from the events to which the statement relates, the matter being investigated...We agree with the circuits that have addressed this issue before us and have determined that Garrity-insulated statements regarding past events under investigation must be truthful to avoid future prosecution for such crimes as perjury and obstruction of justice. Garrity protection is not a license to lie or to commit perjury.*

 Dude, it sounds like she is way needy for affirmation. That's why she needs you to affirm that you still put her on a pedestal and I suspect that's also why she had the affair. 

It's a double-edge sword. It may be part of why you were attracted to her to begin with (that she needs constant affection from you) but it appears that, like any drug, its effect wears off and she will go looking for more affection from other places. Until she gets some psychological help to understand why she went looking for the thrill in the first place, I'd be pretty careful.

But then, if she somehow fixes what is wrong with her, she may not be the same person you fell in love with. 




 You are right with your example. If the act of drinking itself is a crime then you don't have to admit to it. It's the same as pleading not guilty to a judge even though you did commit the crime; you are presumed innocent until proven guilty.

 Compass headings aren't accurate enough for cross country flight, especially when you have crosswinds (meaning the aircraft's nose is pointed in a different direction than it's actually flying. General aviation (private pilots mostly) use a lot of dead reckoning (i.e. looking out the old window). Commercial aircraft flying at high altitudes tune in to radio beacons called NDBs, VORs (and even AM radio stations) and they sort of zig-zag across the country flying straight from radio tower to radio tower.

 Power (Watts) = Potential (Volts) x Flow (Current)

I'm rewriting my explanation to make it applicable to solar panels.... hold on.

Solar panels are rated in watts. A good analogy is water coming through your garden hose and you've got your thumb on the end of it. Your thumb is the resistance (ohms). When you increase your thumb's resistance, you increase the water pressure (which is comparable to volts) and decrease the volume (which is comparable to amps). Your municipal water pumping station is like the wattage. A more powerful pump (higher watts) will increase the water pressure and/or water flow.

 The three Constitutional amendments that give the Supreme Court authority are:

* The 10th: Federal powers

In other words, States can define marriage but not in any way that would violate Constitutional protections. They can, for example, set minimum-age requirements, who can or cannot perform the ceremony, divorce laws, but they can't discriminate by telling people who they can marry (Loving v. Virginia). 




 Public schools are funded from tax revenue and generally must accept everyone who lives within their district. It's a lengthy and almost impossible process to kick someone out of public school. Public schools are governed by an elected school board.

Private schools get no funding from tax revenue. There is an application process and it's easy to kick someone out. They are not required to administer any of the standardized tests that public schools do.

Charter schools are public schools with an application process. They receive a predetermined amount of money per student that they accept and it's generally fairly easy to kick someone out. They must also perform all testing required by state and federal laws. Charter schools are governed by their own boards established by their own bylaws. 




 Frying in oil produces a crispy texture because it has a high boiling point. Unlike potato chips, fries and tater tots aren't cooked to the point of driving all moisture out. They retain some moisture. As soon as you take them out of the fryer the moisture starts to affect the texture of the food. The longer you wait the worse it gets. The refrigerator just makes more moisture collect on the surface since less of it evaporates in the cold air. 




 In Utah they used a variation of the "Please, think of the children" theme. The Utah AG's office argued to the court that the State has an interest in promoting child birth and stable families, and that same-sex marriages hurts the institution and somehow dissuades opposite-sex couples from marrying.

Never mind that:

* There are opposite-sex couples who can't conceive, yet are still granted marriage licenses.

* Divorce rates and the number of single-parent households are higher than ever under current marriage laws.

 Incomplete compared to what we know today, but not wrong. Evolution (speciation) was well known prior to Charles Darwin. What Darwin did was explain how it worked. Prior to Origin of the Species, people thought, for example, that giraffes stretched their necks through the process of reaching for the leaves on the upper branches of trees and passed this on to their offspring. Darwin came up with the theory of natural selection, that mutations (they were thought of as natural variations at that time) which gave an individual a small advantage would be passed on while variations that decreased survival would obviously decrease the chances that individual would produce offspring. 




 Money is probably the greatest economic invention of all time. It lets people get things that they need without actually having to trade for it, and to let people become specialists which accelerated technological advancement.

Before money, there were no people who only were masons because they would go hungry since they would have to trade work directly to a farmer for food. After money, the farmer paid the mason, which allowed him to focus on farming without having to know how to build his house. The mason took the money and paid toolmakers who then paid other farmers for their food.

Humans being what they are, a moneyless society would break down pretty fast because there would always be slackers who just rely on asking others for help without giving much effort in return. 




 Bold red wines have high levels of tannins at bottling time. The tannins, which help preserve the wine, come from the grape skins as well as the oak barrels during secondary fermentation. The grape skins and the oak add complexity but the tannins are so astringent that you will have a more difficult time tasting the subtleties. The tannins break down over time (depolymerize) to reveal the wine's nature.

You can help a young high-tannin wine be more drinkable by decanting it to introduce a lot of oxygen which depolymerizes the tannins. If you want to do this instantly, use a blender (seriously, works great). 




 Because the value of a car depreciates rapidly. If you finance a car, you are more likely to justify purchasing a new or newer model based on your monthly payments. If you pay cash, you are more likely to purchase a used car where the money you lose through depreciation is significantly less than any income you would have gained from the interest by investing the difference. If you even invest it at all. 




 The amount of debt compared to GNP/GDP is quite low. The two aren't independent. The U.S. debt helps us push GDP to its high levels because it funds education grants to make smarter citizens, police and regulatory agencies to help ensure competition, tax incentives to build factories that employ people, roads to transport goods, and a military to protect that economic engine and keep it humming. 




 It depends on the bread recipe too. Ever tasted old butter? Staleness is mostly caused by fats getting oxidized. Breads that have no fat (like bagels) won't taste stale but they dry out, lose their texture and harden faster.

By the way, the same applies to meats. Ever wondered why meat stews and chilis can last in a fridge but grilled steak, even wrapped tight, doesn't? The meat in a stew is covered by liquid which inhibits oxidation of the fats. 




 I think it mostly depends on the speaker design. A speaker can cap the voltage with a small circuit. It still sounds like shit for exactly the same reason but it won't cause any damage.

 On the positive side, you don't have to see the players you've cut every day.  




 CharlieKillsRats has the only correct answer so far.

Look at this way:  Imagine you're a widget craftsman making widgets in your garage. You're not in any debt and you make a decent living producing 1 widget a day. Now imagine that you're also a cool dude that has always paid his bills on time so tons of people want to give you money so you can build a factory and hire workers, and they only want a couple points interest because you're so trustworthy. You will increase your earnings 10X, maybe 100X, and you're going to employ a whole bunch of people. You'd be stupid not to take the money.

That's the U.S. economy to the outside world. Except they are willing to accept as little as 0.22% interest (that's actually the 1 year t-bill rate right now).

The difference between countries like the U.S. and Germany as opposed to many other "first world" countries is that the U.S. actually does a great job converting debt into production. This encourages more people to invest, which accelerates the productivity, keeps standard of living high and interest rates low. 




 The two things that the amplifier supplies the speaker is voltage level and frequency. When you play too loud, it's not the frequency that is too high for the speaker but the voltage level.

Frequency determines how quickly the speaker cone moves back and forth creating low pitch (slow oscillation) or high pitch (fast oscillation). The voltage level determines how *FAR* the speaker moves during the oscillation, which determines how loud or soft the sound is.

If the amplifier overdrives the speaker, distortion happens because the speaker cone can't go any further, i.e. it maxes out. Instead of the air molecules moving in a smooth wave, there are sharp corners. These sharp corners don't sound good. 




 I was a non-teaching male coach of the girls soccer program at a Catholic high school, and I'm not even Catholic. So I was as outside as can be. I was an assistant when the previous head coach retired and that's how I got the job. Winning a couple of state championships and having a nationally ranked team didn't hurt either.

1. Get a teacher on staff to be a liaison. This is invaluable. They help arrange buses, get grades to you, take care of last minute changes, help get the word out, and their room is a place to hold meetings and for kids to put stuff or hang out while waiting for games to start.

2. Since you're not at the school full time, it's hard for parents to come to you so go out of your way to make yourself available to parents. Find some way to have weekly "office hours."

3. Plan. Plan. Plan. Set your game and practice schedule as early as possible. Arrange the buses. Have it in writing and published to the school and parents.

4. Get good team parents (team moms, if you aren't PC). Have them handle parental liaison as much as possible:  Fundraising, uniform orders, team dinners, barbecues, playoff special events.

5. Make sure you go to all the athletic staff meetings. The other teacher-coaches will appreciate you more. Go to their games and support them. Be a part of the school, not just your particular team. You score big points when parents and students see you in the crowd as a supporter.

6. Make sure you thank the teachers that help you or come to your games. They will in turn support your players in school. This is huge for the kids and since you're not a teacher there, they aren't going to get those platitudes from you during the day.

6. I'm sure I'll think of more....

 Eye contact.



And nice legs. 




 No, the photo will be out of focus for everyone because it was out of focus on the film plane due to your manual focusing without wearing glasses.

The viewfinder should have a diopter adjuster to let you compensate for this. If you wear your glasses you should also push back the rubber cup around the viewfinder so your eyeball is about the same distance away as without glasses. 




 Helmets only reduce surface injuries like fractures, lacerations and contusions. They do very little to reduce brain injuries because that occurs when the brain impacts the inside of the skull.

If you hit your head hard enough to cause a concussion, all that force will get transmitted to your brain regardless of whether you have a helmet on or not. You may not crack your skull though, so that's good enough reason to wear a helmet. 




 Emails are fine but are easier to brush aside so follow up if you don't hear from them. 




 Normally aspirated (ie non-turbo) car engines get their power from compression and so are sensitive to ambient air pressure. Aircraft engines do not. They get their thrust from ignition exhaust. To understand why airplanes work better at 40,000 feet, you have to understand how they fly.

There is a relationship between thrust, drag, altitude and ground speed. Lift causes drag and to keep an airplane in the air, you must have enough thrust to overcome that drag. A plane's cruising *airspeed* for any given burn rate is the same regardless of the altitude. What changes with altitude is *ground speed*. (Disregarding winds)

At lower altitudes, the air density is high thus creating a lot of drag which slows down the plane and results in lower ground speed. At higher altitudes and lower air density, the drag is significantly lower thus allowing the aircraft to fly at a much faster ground speed. 30,000-40,000 feet are well within the normal abilities of the engine to maintain cruise and climb.

TL;DR:  Airplanes get thrust from igniting fuel in a combustion chamber, not from compression. Less drag at 40,000 feet from lower air density means faster ground speed, less flying time and less fuel burned on the trip.

Me:  Private pilot. 




 If you're a franchisee, a gift card sale doesn't go to your bottom line. It's net-zero because the cost of goods is 100%--all of it goes to corporate. They will reimburse you when you actually sell a grande latte. So in other words, you sell gift cards as a duty to the franchise even though you don't make a dime from it unless it's stipulated contractually that you get some percentage. 




 Ignore the ads. Even advertised jobs are likely to go to somebody who knows somebody. Seriously, large companies always have openings that aren't currently advertised, or they can make one for somebody who they like.

If you're terrified, tell them so. Say "I just got in town and I found your company. I really like your culture but coming in here to talk to you is something that would normally terrify me." Nothing wrong with that.

Good luck, and let me know how it goes! 




 Humans are social creatures. Humor greases social interaction and gets you in the club/clan/whatever. Subjective humor is just adapting humor to a community whose culture may "get it" whereas others may not.

Example:  Fart humor isn't subjective. It's always funny. /r/watchpeopledie may be funny to a group who would likely get along with each other fairly well, but not very funny to others.

 You already answered your question.
 
*Floating can be defined along the lines of: An object in a fluid experiences an upward force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.*

Whether it's laser etched metal, wood or concrete, they all obey the laws of physics. 




 @lisaslover has a good point but I will go ahead and answer your generalized question with a generalized answer.

*In General* many immigrant families do not feel social stigma about wearing glasses. In fact, in some cultures it signals that you are wealthy enough to get glasses and you have an office job rather than being a laborer. Many immigrants, include those from Asia, place a high importance on school and getting good grades. They probably tend to have their children's vision checked early and regularly and will correct it even at levels where other parents may not. Asian kids tend to be less into sports and therefore may not choose contact lenses which have higher incidences of secondary eye problems such as infections. 




 Can you be more specific? There are a lot of issues. 




 It doesn't "go" anywhere. On a hard drive there is an area that is hidden to you called a file directory. It's a catalog of all of the files on your hard drive, i.e. where the data starts and where the data ends. When you delete a file the catalog entry is deleted, not the data itself. The space once occupied by that file gets cataloged as free space that can be written-over when you save a different file. 




 Because you may decide to have another child some day. If there are enough people who are unvaccinated then the virus will be circulating in the community and your newborn, who can't be vaccinated for several years, will be at mortal risk. 




 I think it would be. But that window has passed and now we have a massive stalemate. Withdrawal is now practically impossible for Israeli politicians. Israel has the strongest economy in the middle east outside the oil kingdoms and there is massive immigration that they are dealing with. If I recall, pretty much any Jew can move to Israel. Netanyahu's answer is permanent development of the West Bank.

The ironic thing is that the immigration has also brought in more and more liberal views of non-Israeli Jews who grew up in Western countries. So maybe there is hope for a solution 20 or 30 years down the road. 




 You must win by more than the spread. The 1/2 point is just to help people understand that concept but it's not required. So if it's New England +10 then they have to win by 11 for you to collect. Books will say +10.5 points so they don't get a whole lot of questions if NE wins by 10. But whether it's +10 or +10.5, it's the same thing. 




 To make sure you either win or lose. In betting, ties are bad. 




 In a lot of ways, Palestine was a pawn. The 6 day war was ostensibly fought over Palestinian territory (from which Israel was carved) but it was really a political fight between Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Iraq vs. Israel. Like Vietnam, Palestine was a proxy for a war of religion/ideology/politics.

Without going into whether Israel did have or did not have a right to exist, had Israel withdrawn from the West Bank after its victory, I think relationships in the middle east would be much different today. 




 Because Israel is under the protection of the United States. The United Nations is powerless since the U.S. holds a seat and a veto on the Security Council. All they can do is issue demands that Israel halt development and occupation of west bank territories. They have no ability to force it. 




 I'm confused. Don't you mean that it's therefore both? After all, vulnerabilities get patched so isn't it a case that the initial design (done by humans) did not adequately anticipate an attack or improperly coded a function, thus creating a security hole? 




 They are therefore they can? Or they can therefore they are? 




 And you can't counterfeit gold or silver, so it's a stable for monetary use. There's also enough of it to mint coins for commerce (unlike other precious metals like paladium). 




 Cool. I think that makes sense. It's gotta be the forces right at the mouth. But that means the only surface that the force can act upon to MOVE the noodle into the mouth would be surface imperfections that transmit the force from high pressure to low, left to right (in relation in your drawing).

ASCII art:

    F --/\   F --/\  F --/\
    -----  --------  -------  ----
    NOODLE
    ---------  ------  -------  --
          --\/   --\/    --\/ 




 Ahhh, very plausible. 




 cnash, that is a very good analysis, except for one problem:  Axial stress. A wet noodle will distort under even very low loads. 




 That's what I'm thinking too. That it requires air movement and the air must be pushing on surface imperfections.

If you had a perfect seal between the noodle and your lips that did not allow any air to come through, the noodle would not move (even if there were no friction whatsoever). If the noodle surface were completely smooth, the noodle also would not move as the air passing over it has no surface to push on that doesn't have an opposite cancelling force.

So pressure differential doesn't fully explain the noodle movement. There must be air movement to make the noodle move. 




 It's still cylindrical, even when it's sitting between the lips and in your mouth. Ok, bye bye. 




 That's kind of my question. Sorry if I didn't explain well. What forces are not canceled? There must be a surface for the air to push on. Which part of the noodle? The itty bitty end? The cylindrical surface? 




 The noodle is cylindrical. Wouldn't the forces cancel if applied equally around the cylinder? 




 The noodle is cylindrical. All the forces would then cancel each other out. 




 When you blow on a balloon, it moves because there is more pressure on one side of the balloon than the other. Ever tried to push a wet spaghetti noodle? Yeah, it's all connected to itself but it's not stiff, therefore force does not transfer well. 




 To what part of the noodle is that pressure (force) being applied? 




 You know, I've asked this question of my friends and I gotta say, this is the best answer I've heard yet! 




 I get that your mouth is creating a vacuum but vacuum does not exert force. The force must come from the positive air pressure outside the mouth. What part of the noodle is the force pushing on? 




 The waves of a microwave oven are tuned to heat the water, which is exactly what you want when defrosting something frozen (because the water is what is frozen). Oven heat is absorbed by all of the mass of whatever you're defrosting. 




 Depends on where you're standing. Sound waves can add or cancel as they mix together.

(That's the science behind noise canceling headphones, which actually create a sound that is opposite in phase to the noise it's cancelling.) 




 If you lock up all the ones who test positive, you would save a lot of lives but at the expense of mistakenly imprisoning people who will never commit that crime. If you don't lock them up, more innocent people will die as a result. 




 There are a lot of visits to see an orthodontist and their assistants that all earn a wage, in a building that has an associated lease. And that orthodontist has paid for a bunch of equipment that they need, and malpractice insurance because you never know whether the kid who is getting braces is the child of a lawyer. 




 Nobody strives to create a healthy job market. They strive to create a product or service that people want, that they can charge money for and get rich off it. The job creation is just a side benefit. 




 If you took mass from the moon and brought it to earth then there is no net difference in the system. The moon would be lighter but Earth would have more mass and would exert more gravitational pull on the moon (I think). So from the laws of thermodynamics there won't be any change. 




 It's a civil contract. Jail and fines are to punish criminal violations. 

In a civil contract, when the contract is breached you would sue in civil court. You would show that you were damaged by the actions of the other party and request some monetary amount of compensation. 




 Although society doesn't look at it this way, sexuality is supposedly a spectrum. I could see for someone who is in the middle of the spectrum (we would call them bisexual, I suppose), you could feel that way about the opposite sexes. 




 Cold soggy pasta is exactly why I don't like cold pasta so your explanation of pizza crust vs. pasta makes sense. To me, cold pizza crust is OK and I don't mind eating cold pizza at all. But I have to heat up leftover pasta because the cold noodles just taste all wrong to me. 




 If you need glasses it means your eyeball isn't perfectly round. If you're nearsighted like the majority of people, your eyeball is too long. Eyeglasses correct this by distorting the view and under-focusing so that the focus point correctly hits the back of your eyeball.

 Modern structural plywood   wood frame homes can withstand quite a bit. Wood is great until you have to go over 4 or 5 stories, then it becomes a liability. 




 OK, tall highrise. Mass all the way up. The ground moves, the mass of the upper floors don't want to move, due to inertia. Shit bends.

In a steel frame high rise, an earthquake can damage and weaken the framework of the lower floors, thus causing the entire building to collapse.

You weld angle braces to strengthen the floors, like [these.](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_sd4aOA0Ur-I/SwNmHworrkI/AAAAAAAAIls/Gi4TDp-Q8AI/f0720025_thumb%5B3%5D.jpg?imgmax=800) But they can buckle due to axial load if they bend too far, so you put a concrete jacket around them, like [this](http://enr.construction.com/images2/2012/11/enr11052012cs_stadium_brbA.jpg) to keep them from going outside spec. 




 Females don't derive benefit from multiple partners as they can only be pregnant with one child at a time. Males can produce multiple pregnancies thus derive benefit. 




 Humans don't produce a lot of offspring, relative to other species. We don't have litters like dogs or produce thousands like a spider's egg sac. The goal is quality: Produce the best offspring and help them live.

So there's a tension between male and female. Females tend towards monogamy because they need a stable provider to help protect the few offspring. Males have tendencies to spread their seed around since they get so few opportunities to produce offspring. 




 Yes, I think Syriza will cave. They said what they needed to get elected. After all, politics is still about power. But when they face reality I can't imagine that they can be that stupid. 




 The trial was a farce from start to finish. There wasn't a jury that tried Saddam Hussein. It was a tribunal with American and British "legal advisors." His execution occurred less than two months after the verdict was rendered. Both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch deemed the trial "unfair" and the U.N. declined to support it or its verdict because it did not meet international standards. The first chief judge of the tribunal actually resigned during the trial because he said that the U.S. and Iraqi governments were interfering and influencing the court. He was replaced. Saddam's lawyer was kidnapped and assassinated during the trial by Shias dressed as Iraqi police but the trial continued. One of Saddam's American lawyers, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsay Clark also decried the tribunal as unfair, and said that it was merely a show trial, that the U.S. was in fact running it while using Iraqis as a front.

The events for which he was tried occurred in 1982. But it wasn't until AFTER 9/11/2001 that America was interested in invading Iraq, capturing Saddam to put him on trial. 




 Pretty good summary. People are concerned about Greece and its weight on the Euro but I don't think people actually think a Greek exit is likely since it would set them back into the stone age. 




 As others have said, it shows that light behaves like a wave and a particle. This is how it works:

When you shine light through a thin slit, what you see on the wall behind it is not a distinct line but a fuzzy line. This shows that light is gravitationally bent by the edges of the slit as it passes through, therefore it must have mass.

Now you add a second slit and a second light so that the two images on the wall overlap. The slits polarize the light. If the lights do not behave like a wave then you will just see that the area that is overlapped will be brighter when you turn on the second light. But that's not what you see. Instead, you see alternating bands of dark and light. That's because two waves coming from different angles, as they mix, will cancel each other out in some spots and increase the energy in other spots. 




 Except that a photon is a particle and obeys particle physics. Its path bends, reflects and refracts and it imparts momentum and force. 




 Do explain why the IRS is unconstitutional when we have this thing called the sixteenth amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and whether you believe that the U.S. Supreme Court has the power to make decisions on this matter? 




 They want to get elected and they live in a right wing community.

Edit:  Sorry, that's not a helpful answer but I honestly don't know of any logical basis for their claim other than populism. The 16th amendment to the Constitution gives the federal government the ability to tax.

 Even though you don't feel it though your feet, your house is likely passing on the vibrations caused by the moving air that is generating sound waves as it moves around your house. 




 As girls enter and go through puberty, they begin thinking sexually. It's parentally and socially acceptable for a girl to express sexual desire through a boy band poster and not through putting up pictures of boy classmates all over their room.

Secondly, boy bands are idealized targets of affection. They represent success (and thus stability) so are biologically appealing to girls as they approach child-bearing ages. 




 Your example is interesting but by itself doesn't portray an accurate picture. Where do you get your food costs? In Canada, food comes from grocery stores whose prices are fairly standard. In Nicaragua, I suspect without having been there that there are public markets whose prices vary greatly with availability and your ability to barter. Secondly, there are other costs to living in either place such as taxes, housing and transportation, as well as the differences in unemployment rates (i.e. the supply of workers which affects the wages offered). The economies of Canada and Nicaragua are very different. 




 I can't speak for the accuracy of the image but when Alexander The Great and his Macedonian army traveled through and conquered the area, they left quite a bit of genetic material. There are whole villages of blonde, blue-eyed Afghanis and a high prevalence of heterochromia.

 It's interesting this guy said it was painless. I remember reading a story written by another host (is that what you would call them?) who had larvae on his back which he also decided to carry full term in the name of science. He said the emergence was the most painful thing he ever experienced in his life. 




 I think they're the hooks that the human botfly larvae has on its body to prevent anyone from trying to pull it out. I believe they retract when the larvae starts emerging. Pretty interesting little creatures. I studied up on them after a trip to the tropics that resulted in some skin boils that I thought may have been botfly larva.

 You're welcome! I recommend "Political Philosophy, a very short introduction" by David Miller. It can be read in about 1-2 hours and it gives a pretty good background for further reading if you get hooked. In one of my favorite college courses we read "History of Political Philosophy" by Leo Strauss. 




 NATO stands for North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It started of as a collection of western european countries and the U.S. who entered an agreement that if any of them were to come under military attack, the others would be obligated to come to their defense. It's a herd defense strategy and it was done to counter any possible aggression by the Soviet Union.

NATO's mission is now obviously moot. The past few military uses haven't been to defend NATO countries but ostensibly for humanitarian aid and NATO *interests* (Yugoslavia, Libya and Syria for example). Critics say that NATO should be disbanded and a new treaty be crafted that more accurately accounts for modern threats. 




 If you define reaction as seeing-brain processing-muscle reaction:

The neuro pathways of a fly are on a much smaller scale thus impulses just don't have very far to go from the eyes to the brain.

A fly's response is actually quite complicated and researchers are still trying to figure out how they make decisions when a predator is approaching. It turns out they have a really wide variety of moves and are unpredictable. 




 @ChickinSammich, thanks for the answer. Makes sense. I'm going to mark this as explained. 




 They have oil too, lots of it. The profits from the oil are put into a sovereign wealth fund that basically gives everyone an annuity. Pretty sweet but not everybody gets to have oil in their backyard. Damn, wish I was finn. Well, except for the winters.

 It's human nature. We are all guilty of being too optimistic about something. For example, influenza kills 53,000 people a year in the U.S. but few of us go get the flu vaccine. 




 I don't know if you should just assume the business owner wouldn't spend that money. Even if he just put it in the bank, it's capital that the bank can use to make a loan. 




 That's a good question. I'll start with some sociopolitical philosophy. A society develops when a bunch of people get together and agree to live by a set of rules. It can be all the citizens of the United States and the rules are the U.S. Constitution, or it can be a bunch of guys in an apartment and the rules are written on a piece of paper on the fridge. For the guys in the apartment, they may all agree on "common expenses" like toilet paper, detergent, dishes, etc. and each has to pitch in $50 a month towards the common costs. That's a tax.

A country uses a tax to provide for the common good:  Roads, military, jails, schools, though you may not get a direct benefit from all of the things they spend money on. 




 As I understand it, the ACA isn't a the government competing against a business, but a set of laws that basically say you have to buy health insurance, and it gives states some money to subsidize the low income earners? 




 All debt has a term and the U.S. is always paying off debt as it matures. It has not defaulted (yet). What John Maynard Keynes envisioned was that a country would stop borrowing when the economy was good and it no longer had to stimulate it. 




 The argument for a capital gains tax that is lower than income tax is because you could lose all of your invested capital whereas if you are working for wage income you won't ever actually lose money to your company. Secondly, you must invest for at least a year before you can realize that lower rate. It's a way to reward people for taking the risk of investing longer-term.

The counter argument to this is that the returns on investment already includes the risk. By lowering the tax rate on one versus another investment you introduce an artificial force that distorts the market.

I inform, you decide :) 
























 Nicely done. 




 Freedom allows for anything. When you have complete freedom in an unregulated market, how does that affect capitalism? 




 You are equating freedom to capitalism. So what happens when there is no government and it's complete freedom with pure unregulated capitalism? 




 The best book I was ever assigned in college. I also got to see Zinn speak at my college a few years back. He told a heartbreaking story about when he was bomber pilot at the end of WWII. 




 They are both grammatically correct but they don't mean the same thing. *Perfectly* is an adverb. It modifies verbs. *Perfect* is an adjective. It modifies nouns.

"Made it perfectly" means that you made no mistakes in the process of making. It also *implies* that "it" is well-made.

"Made it perfect" means that you made "it" into something perfect, but doesn't really describe how you made it. 




 We haven't found anything sweet in the natural world that can kill us. Part of the theory is that sensitivity to sweetness helps us identify safe foods. 




 The browser has already started downloading the file when it displays the "save as" dialog.

 In the old days, arcane programming languages (Fortran, C) didn't have compilers that were intelligent enough to infer a procedure's memory allocation requirements just from the code. When you jump into a procedure, the computer has to build a stack frame, allocating just enough memory from the stack to contain all of your variables, pointers and handles. Declaring all of your variables at the start of your procedure is telling the compiler how big your stack frame needed to be.

These days a lot of languages are *interpreted*--they aren't even compiled (Python, Javascript). For the rest, the compilers are now pretty smart about it but the language syntax of Java derives from C/C++ and it's a holdover. 




 Actually, the Christian Science Monitor's news reporting is quite unbiased and Pulitzer Prize-winning. They go out of their way to not get caught up in mass hysteria, and to maintain high standards of decorum. They are well respected in journalism. 




 I think there are a couple of explanations. First, the true believers have to die off so it takes at least a generation for non-revolutionary social change. In the meantime the young became more and more disillusioned as they saw that what they were taught in school did not match the reality on the street. They saw that the struggle remained and that the bourgeoisie was merely replaced by oligarchs. Second, in the latter half of the 20th century, after a series of tragic political wars (Afghanistan, Vietnam, the Cold War), people were pushing back against centralized governance and federalism all around the world, including both the USSR and the United States. Instead of the view that the government will take care of you, the prevailing view now is that you have to take care of yourself. That, of course, plays right into capitalism. 




 Marxist socialism requires centralized control and planning and relies on buy-in of all participants so it just isn't manageable on a large scale. When it encounters problems, it will become unstable very quickly and collapse. Capitalism, though it has its own problems, is more tolerant of mistakes, errors and human imperfections and is thus more stable. 

As we have seen, no social system exists at a perfect state, at least not for very long. It must have some kind of self-correction built in or else it will collapse. 




 The stuff inside our cells also push out at exactly the same pressure so all of our cells are at equilibrium with the air. 




 4 major things that affect the quality of a digital camera:

1. Resolution and quality of the sensor. Those are the megapixels. More megapixels is potentially more detail, but other factors come into play. Read on.
2. Post-processing. The camera makes image adjustments (contrast, brightness, white balance) then compresses it to make the file size smaller. There are big variations here because some cameras have faster processors and thus can do more. Also, the higher the compression, the smaller the file size but also the less detail the image will have.
3. Lens quality. More expensive cameras have more glass elements in the lens and higher quality glass and coatings. This helps the image come into sharper focus from the center all the way to the edge. Lower quality cameras are visibly fuzzy around the edges of the image.
4. Lens size. Larger lenses allow more light in and render lens imperfections and dirt/smudges less obvious. They also give you shallower depth of field for more creativity. 




 I can certainly understand political compromise to be able to pass anti-abortion laws. Part of my question seeks to better understand the personal beliefs of pro-lifers because it really seems like the majority are personally OK with abortion in those circumstances. Do you agree? 




 I'm with you. 




 When was the last time you or anyone you know went into Radio Shack? Why should that company stay in business in a market economy? 




 I looked at the Gallup numbers and even Googled to get them going back farther than what the opinion article showed. The Gallup statistical trends fairly well match the BLS trend, with the peak unemployment in 2009 and a steady employment growth since then. The only real difference is that Gallup includes both seekers and non-seekers in the unemployed statistic. It's certainly valuable to know both but it doesn't really matter whether you lump the two together. 

So I guess the question is what to do about people who have given up looking for work? I guess you have to ask why that happens? 

Let's say I was an NFL player but I was released by my team. I have worked out with several other teams but none of them so far have decided to offer a contract. I've decided to hang up the cleats. Can you still call me an NFL player?

So the question is what you call somebody who isn't looking for work? Sure, they're unemployed. Maybe the better thing is to call the BLS statistic "active seekers" but that doesn't quite have the same ring to it. 




 What I meant is that the pro-life side wants to enact laws banning abortions but many of those laws include exceptions to allow an abortion for rape or incest. 




 This is not meant to be a debate or be inflammatory. I just don't understand how somebody justifies the rape   incest exception. Is it merely political expedience? 




 It's far from certain that more money equates to more votes. In some examples it does appear to be a factor but there are also times when it works against a candidate.

Candidates can't afford to turn down money, and that's really where the problem lies. Money doesn't necessarily buy a candidate a win but it does buy the candidate. 




 Less reflection. Water absorbs more light. Our brain interprets the amount of light hitting our eyes as brightness/lightness. Less reflected light will make the surface appear darker. 




 Thanks, that graph is helpful indeed. 




 Thanks, that's a helpful article. If wage growth is around 2% but inflation is currently 1-1.5%, isn't it fairly inline?

Still, productivity is still increasing so that additional GDP is going somewhere. Perhaps that explains the increasing wealth gap. What to do about that? 









 For me, these four conditions:

1. When you earn enough to house, clothe and feed yourself so as to not be a burden on anyone else.
2. Your kids, if you have any, are well adjusted and generally happy
3. You enjoy being around your friends and your friends genuinely like you
4. You have enough free time and resources to do some things you really enjoy that don't make you any money 




 I've heard this claim over the past couple of years but can you supply a source to back it up?

 I don't disagree that it's mostly vanity. Still, Mercedes can't just rebadge a C class and charge 3X unless they install an aromatherapy system. 




 OK, fine. :)

The Mercedes S class has a 200 meter radar and two cameras for 3D optical sensing, biturbo V12 or V8 with a 10.0 compression ratio, computer controlled variable suspension dampening with camera-controlled adjustment, two 12.3" LCD displays in the drivers dash with road-ahead night time video display, one display is touch sensitive. Navigation, communication and system controls on the steering wheel, a Burmester 24 speaker sound system, car systems that are controllable from your smartphone, massaging seats, aromatherapy climate control, adaptive cruise control (stop   go self driving), lane departure warning, blind spot detection....

It's pretty amazing that it's reliable as it is. It's also why it's probably not a good idea to buy older used S-Classes, 7-Series or A8s. 




 Not according to the Social Security Administration.
http://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html

The latest year they have stats is 2013 but there's no reason to think 2014 went negative.

The last time wages decreased was 2009, at the height of the recession. With unemployment dropping to 5.6%, I can't see that wages will be decreasing from 2013 to 2014.

Can you cite any study for your claim? 




 It's water vaporizing and creating bubbles that pop. 




 Land Rover (Defender 90) owner here. Can confirm. It's the equivalent of a supermodel girlfriend. Looks good but man, high maintenance. 




 In the U.S. the German auto manufacturers only import their most expensive lines which give them the most profit margin. These models have a lot more features than a basic car and are engineered for higher performance and capability, e.g. all wheel drive, independent wishbone suspension on all 4 wheels, higher compression, variable valve timing, and so on and so on. 

TL;DR: More stuff means more stuff that breaks. 




 If you didn't manage to sell before you get foreclosed, I believe the bank will take receivership of the house. They will sell at whatever price they want and they have no incentive to sell at FMV. They only want to recover their loan and foreclosure expenses. 









 It's not a debate. I'm seeking understanding on how someone on the pro-life side reconciles what appears to be a contradiction. 




 It's what pro-lifers have said.

From the National Right To Life website:
*"For more than 100 years, medical science has known conclusively that every individual's life begins at the moment of fertilization."* 




 The chance of birth defects is higher but probably still pretty rare in countries with good health care. 

The second argument is the same argument that pro-choicers use, that it's not good to force a woman to keep an unwanted child.

The third is the sticking point. It *does* seem that there are circumstances in which the mother's feelings outweigh the life in the womb. It would appear that pro-lifers and pro-choicers have a lot of similarities. 




 So it's not about the life of the baby?

 That would be the most basic of basic backups. But it's effective. 

Yes, you should be able to copy/paste to a Windows backup drive. Create a folder for your files first. Don't touch or delete any of the files  or folders that Windows has already created. 




 As Teekno said, a MLM company has product(s). Sales of the product infuses revenue into the company to be distributed among the levels. That being said, nobody buys into a MLM company to sell vitamins or fruit juice.

Pyramid schemes don't have products and revenue. They are often investment schemes around capital assets such as real estate. They promise a high return to attract investors. In order to keep attracting investors they must show that they paid those promised rates of return. The managers often take new investment money to pay the returns, in order to attract more investment. And so on and so forth until there are few new investors putting in and lots of old investors looking for payment. 




 A sonic boom is all of the sound that a jet engine makes compressed into a single wave. So I suppose if you passed the speed of light and there was actually light shining on you that you're reflecting, a bystander would see a bright flash of light.

But I could be wrong... With all those photons compressed together you might go Supernova. 




 See my answer. You're doing backup type #4 - system backup with Microsoft Windows proprietary backup format. 




 In the print options screen you can usually select grayscale, which will send print job containing no color information. Your printer should then only use the black ink. 




 There are different kinds of backups. From simplest to most complex:

1. Basic file backup - this just makes a single copy of your files. If your computer crashes you have to reinstall your operating system and programs but you can get a copy of your documents from the last time of backup. The benefit of this kind of backup is that the files on your external hard drive are exactly the same kind of file that you see on your computer's hard drive. You don't need your backup software to be able to restore a file. You can just drag/drop of copy/paste.

2. Basic file backup with timestamped versions - Like #1 except it keeps multiple changes of your documents. This is good for people who need to be able to restore a version of a document from a week or month ago, such as writers.

3. Mirror Backup (also called a clone) - This makes an exact duplicate of your hard drive. This can be used to completely restore your computer in the event of a drive failure but it's slow because your entire drive is copied during each backup. The backup's files are also plainly readable like with the basic backup.

4. System Backup - You can use this to restore the exact state of your computer just like the mirror backup. You can also have different versions so you can go back in history to selectively restore only a few files. The downside is that this is proprietary across different software so you need to have the software company's restore disc to recover from a failed drive. The files are also in a proprietary format so aren't plainly readable if you just wanted to quickly browse your backup and view some files. 




 Human evolution is over. Or it has slowed to such a crawl that it might as well be over. First, our ability to manipulate our environment, to cure disease, to modify our foods means that we don't have to wait generations. A gun means I don't have to outrun the mountain lion or bear any more. My coat lets me live above the arctic circle year round. My vitamins and my Kroger frequent shopper card lets me make delicious tropical fruit salads in the middle of winter.

Second, birth control has turned the mechanism by which evolution works--natural selection--on its head. In social after every social study, the individuals who are most well adapted to modern living are the ones having the fewest children. The well off are having few babies, if any at all, while the poor are breeding like rabbits. 




 The media absolutely must call out Rand Paul on his "many cases." Nobody should be allowed to make claims like that without being forced to give up proof. 




 Do you mean the other way around? Malware disguised as a media file?

It's possible but would probably rely on exploiting a bug in a media player. Not impossible, but unlikely. 




 Hmmm, I'm impressed they made the effort to be realistic. 




 ISIS is a guerilla group and are mixing in with the population. The west is not yet willing to accept the civilian casualties that would result from "steamrolling." 




 The screen is made up of two layers:  The glass on top and the digitizer below it. Your glass is broken but the digitizer, the part that detects your finger touches, is still intact and operational. 




 I was well into adulthood when I found out awry was pronounced "ah-rye."

BTW, I think "ruut" ("rt") is perfectly acceptable though incorrect. Ask him how he says "roto-rooter" then having him sing the jingle. 




 Because reddit is more interesting. 




 "She's not my type." Sometimes you just gotta lie. 




 When I toured The Great Pyramids this was the general explanation from our guide who was an Egyptian Egyptologist. 




 Did they make any sound? Fail then. 




 Men are carriers and her husband could have contracted the virus from a previous partner (or a secondary partner during their relationship). 




 To people who are downvoting:  Einstein's theory of general relativity. 




 Man-made fibers harbor the naturally occurring bacteria from your skin that produce body odors. That particular bacteria doesn't like cotton or wool as much. 




 At some point in the future, the Milky Way and Andromeda will collide. 




 Okay, Einstein. :) 




 Pedophilia isn't illegal and those suffering from it should seek treatment. It's the manifestation into acts that harm others that is illegal. 




 Ah, I misinterpreted. I think that a lot of leeway is given to the police officer by the review board. Where I live we have a community review board and it still lets a lot go. The judgment is not whether the officer made the *best* decision, but whether the officer made a *justifiable* decision. 




 I am really not a defender of cops. I just wanted to bring up the fact that we all suffer from cognitive biases. I actually think that the profession attracts a certain kind type of bullying personality. I certainly agree that police should and must be prosecuted and punished when there is evidence that the activity was illegal and premeditated. I think police departments should fire these kinds of cops when they find disturbing patterns of behavior, before it becomes a PR nightmare.

Police also just screw up. I'm glad I don't have a reporter calling me every time I write a bad bug into my code. This is something we also should be aware of. Then there's all the hazy area. Police are asked to make very tough decisions that could be life/death and make them very quickly. When I see one of those, I'm just thankful I don't have to be the one evaluating it. 




 This is part of the reason why I have yet to be convinced that self-driving cars will actually take off. For liability purposes, someone must be responsible for the actions and decisions of the car, and that person is the driver. This is how the FAA treats Boeing 777s and Airbus A380s that can fly themselves completely from takeoff to landing. The Pilot in Command is ultimately responsible.

As the driver in command of a self-driving car, you assume responsibility. I can see that it would become a more stressful driving experience around town rather than a less stressful one. Perhaps on a controlled-access interstate it might be relaxing, but I can't see it being relaxing in a city, even if the car was a much better driver than me. I would still need to pay attention and be ready to assume control. 




 Broken taillight. A very popular reason to pull somebody over, especially around the nightlife district. It'll happen until they also invent self-repairing cars. 




 Some tissues either repair very slowly or don't repair at all. Cartilage, for example, doesn't have blood vessels thus don't get the level of nutrients needed to reproduce quickly and repair. 




 When the only thing you hear are stories of people goofing up, you're going to think that it happens a lot more than it actually does. It's a proven cognitive bias and it's something that you should be aware of because you (yes, even you) are susceptible to it. In order to make rational evaluations of the community in which you live, you should be aware of the ways perception can let you down. I encourage you to listen to a few of David McRaney's podcasts of "[You Are Not So Smart](http://youarenotsosmart.com/podcast)." 

Hopefully this will lead you to explore the topic in greater depth, looking at actual data sets. 




 So your wipers don't get frozen to your windshield. It lets you scrape the ice off your whole windshield. By the way, flex your wiper blades along the entire length before you put them back down. This breaks the ice that tends to build up at the grip points where the rubber meets the steel. That ice buildup prevents the blade from conforming to the windshield curve which causes the streaking as the blade goes across the windshield. 




 The medical industry uses the term disease differently than your understanding. The DSM-IV calls addiction and dependence a brain disease. In medicine, brain diseases can be from a pathogen or could come from other causes such as trauma, tumors or hydrocephalus.

The reason why it's a brain disease is because the brain of a drug-dependent person behaves differently than someone else who is a non-user or a recreational user. Their brain produces less of a high in response to the drug (tolerance), and produces withdrawal symptoms when they get off the drug.

Lastly, I caution you about your viewpoint. Even those who have overcome their addictions through willpower understand how difficult it is and how easy it is for them to relapse. For many, it takes a lot more than willpower. It takes emotional support from their friends, family and community. Even with that, success is low. 




 It's a cognitive bias called The Availability Cascade. You don't hear about the times that a cop stopped a crime or a criminal because that's expected. /r/news articles that are unusual get upvoted but that tends to make those kinds of stories appear to be more prevalent than they actually are. That in turn promotes and encourages more of those kinds of stories to be posted. 




 The air doesn't decrease in temperature gradually as you go up in altitude. If stable enough it tends to form layers with boundaries. The same goes for ocean temperatures as you go down. The air mixes within the layers much more than it mixes across the boundary. Moist air condenses at the boundary, creating a flat bottomed cloud. 




 Israel *is* Palestine *is* Israel. History did not start 70 years ago. Until the creation of Israel, everyone in the area was called Palestinian, regardless of whether they were Muslim (80% of the population), Jews (15%) or Christians (5%).

Now, put yourself in the shoes of an Islamic Palestinian. You and generations of your family have lived in some house in a city like Jaffa for two thousand years or more. You've been ruled by Ottomans, then the British Mandate but you've always been Palestine. Then this guy comes along and suddenly says you're a new country, Israel (a Hebrew word), even though Jews were a small minority. Immediately, the U.S. and their western allies in the U.N. recognized sovereignty. You had no say. Suddenly, you're now living in a Jewish country.

The British initially supported the Islamic Palestinians and the Arab coalition (Trans-Jordan, Iraq, Syria and Egypt) but provided less than promised military support. The power-hungry King Abdullah of Jordan stabbed the Palestinians in the back because he made backroom deals with Ben Gurion to annex the West Bank. As such, he provided only nominal military support to the campaign despite being the most powerful military force in the region. 




 A college degree generally boosts your income over the rest of your lifetime (YMMV). Starting a business is riskier. Business loans are also often collateralized so you are going to risk assets like your home. 




 Jerusalem is important to Jews, Muslims and Christians. 




 The Palestinians did not the start the 6 day war or the 1948 war. They are caught in the middle. First, the country of Israel was just *declared* by David Ben Gurion. There wasn't any treaty between any parties. Western powers in the U.N. voted to recognize it so that it would be a place for Jews to go rather than have to accept post-WWII Jewish immigrants into their own countries. Prior to Ben Gurion, in the area that is now Israel only about 15% of the population were Jews.

The 1948 war and later the 6 day war were ostensibly over Palestinian rights but truthfully were political wars. Islamic Palestinians were the vast majority of the population but they were told by the Arab armed forces to flee the area, which they did. 700,000 of them. Israel won the '48 war and took the opportunity to basically lock the gate. The refugees were not allowed back into Israel (where they and their families had lived for millenia) nor into the neighboring countries and basically were stuck in the west bank, which was taken over by Jordan. Later, after the 6 day war, Israel took hold of that territory as well.

The Palestinians have been fucked by both sides throughout the history of this conflict. 




 Thanks. I never knew about ocular dominance. 









 Numerous studies show that Americans have been conditioned to identify the ".99" as being a bargain. Secondly, "9.99" also appears much less expensive than "$10.00" even though it's only by a penny.

As an aside, a ".95" are identified as being "a good value" (as opposed to the .99 bargain).
