 ...would they be injecting the water if they weren't fracking? 

And could they frack as cheaply without injecting the water somewhere? If so, why don't they? 

It just seems arbitrary for the public to make the distinction between the fracking process and the fracking wastewater disposal process causing the quakes. It's not like the latter happens without the former... 




 That's probably the stupidest argument I've ever heard. 

And I've spent a lot of time on reddit, so that's really saying something. 

It's like saying "If smoking causes cancer, why don't terrorists just start giving out cigarettes!? Since they're not, obviously smoking doesn't cause cancer!"  




 From a [comment 10 minutes ago, in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/35l2mw/whats_causing_texas_earthquakes_fracking_most/cr5ro87?context=3): 

When they stop fracking the quakes stop, when they start fracking the quakes start again. It can't be a coincidence. The other day we had a 4.0 the other day and we have had some gas mains explode because of this and people lost their lives and their homes. Our gas mains are old and need replaced before they can handle all the movement.

 Hard to say for sure, but the scientific literature suggests 350ppm... 
























 Yeah well "Foxes actually make great cock house guards" just didn't have quite the same ring...  




 Oh and [about the 2/3rds number](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-06-26/climate-change-and-the-two-thirds-imperative): 

The two-thirds imperative was enunciated in the 2012 edition of the IEAs annual World Energy Outlook: No more than one-third of proven reserves of fossil fuels can be consumed prior to 2050 if the world is to achieve the 2 degrees C goal 




 According to the[ Congressional Research Service](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/just-how-dirty-are-canadas-oil-sands-anyway/2012/05/23/gJQAGdlkkU_blog.html): 

oil from tar sands produces 14 to 20 percent more carbon emissions than other oil the U.S. imports.

So no, this is not a clean fuel alternative. But please, don't let facts keep you from rationalizing and grasping for straws... 




 Yeah I honestly expected some right-wing outrage about a foreign company using big government to steal private property of ordinary Americans, but by and large it's only the locals who seem to care (on the conservative side anyway.)  




 The point is that the science is telling us we need to leave 2/3rds of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground. 

How, then, does it make sense to build NEW fossil fuel infrastructure? 

It's like your doctor telling you to go on a diet, and instead you sign up for a rewards card at Cinnabon. 

And I don't think anyone (well informed) thinks stopping KXL will have a major effect on the industry. But it's like the divestment campaign, it's meant to revoke their social license to operate. 




 The Jargon-Believability relationship is a strong one. With your formal training, there is great shitty potential. 

I don't know the fancy names for things (and am too lazy to look up), so I just resort to using nature documentary syntax to make them believable. 




 If the pipeline doesn't make it cheaper to transport the oil, why would they build it? 

Do you really think the industry that knows it's destroying the climate but continues anyway is pushing a pipeline on environmental grounds, and not for its profit?

 80% of Americans  I never see 80% of Americans agreeing on anything when it comes to other issues, so this is very unusual  believe the federal government should limit greenhouse gas emissions by businesses and in particular by public utilities.

 I have, twice.

What's more effective at causing fear, an improvised explosive on a bus full of people, or a minor tremor?

Oh, in that straw man effigy you just constructed? Well proceed with the bonfire then.  




 /r/science has rules against the sort of psuedoscience that breitbart publishes consistently, so it's not just my bias but that pesky liberal bias many claim reality has... 




  Doing that might make fracking non-cost effective

Then no, it's not a different discussion. Fracking is used because it's the cost is just slightly lower than the price they can sell it for. If they can't pump the water underground without treatment, they can't frack. They can't frack, no earthquakes... 




 Yes, why aren't terrorists engaging in incredibly expense oil drilling technology that produces small earthquakes sometimes in some locations? 

Such a good question. You're so very very smart. I'm surprised the CIA hasn't picked you up to be a super-spy-genius-counter-terrorist yet.

 Point isn't exactly how long each step is. Point's that you can draw step lines all over the place, but that just distracts from the long-term warming trend.  




 The world came together, recognized the problem was human emissions, created a policy to deal with it, and have been reducing those emissions since. It's called the Montreal Protocol, and it's been one of the most successful environmental policies to date.

 The algorithm, based on triangulation of reputable sources.

 I am absolutely STOKED about the new Google algorithm. Though it may not (at least at the start) be sophisticated enough for the climate debate, since it uses the three-point verification and a lot of misinformation is just slightly too subtle to be covered like that. 

BUT the outlets that publish untrue stuff that it does pick up also publish climate misinformation, so hopefully there will be some cross-over perks...
