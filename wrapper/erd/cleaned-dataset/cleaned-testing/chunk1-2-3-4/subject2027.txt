Alone, with friends, family, parents, asshole roommate. Why? How do you like it?  Etc. 





















































































































































































































































































































 Welcome everyone to GTSIM. It has been just over two weeks since I started this sub and it has grown rapidly. We have 996 subscribers as this is posted and I expect it to pass 1K by the time most of you read this. 

First of all, I want to thank all of you for upvoting and subscribing. There isnt much interaction in terms of comments and submissions, but that will change soon as we grow. Most of the posts are mine, and I am fine providing content while this sub grows. If you guys think I am submitting too much or not enough,  let me know. 

Secondly,  I want to thank /u/dontgive1011 for his css contributions. If you guys have any feedback on the look of the sub, send a modmail or post on this thread. 

Lastly, please start contributing more content. Even if its just a picture you see on another sub or website and think "thats a gtsim shot," feel free to xpost it here. And if you find a discussion out in the front page subs where this sub is relevant, name drop it, even as a joke. It seriously helps. For example, many new users hear about /r/gonewild from someone making a joke about it on a default sub. Try dropping those hints but with /r/gtsim if it seems relevant.

Together we can grow this sub.

I'm still a new mod and I am learning so if you have any concerns,  advice, suggestions, hate, or love, let me know. Even if it is just to let me know about a typo on the sidebar or something. 

Thanks, test_subject2027. 






















































 This happened two years ago. We were having a bbq before a game and he prepared some veggie burgers and I made some meat burgers. He mushed his veggie burgers up real good and it actually looked like meat after we cooked them. We put the leftovers in the fridge and went to the game. 

When we got back I was a little bit drunk and was hungry so I opened the fridge and grabbed what I thought was the left over meat burgers. 

It was a mis steak.

 What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills.

I am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.

You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands.

Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.
