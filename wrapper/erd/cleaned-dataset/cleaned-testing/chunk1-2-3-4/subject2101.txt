 I recently rewatched D R, and reviewed that in the final moments of GNR, her neck gets sliced and splatters a stream of blood across part of the surface of the moon.  In D R, this shown starting at time-code [1:15:56].

Is this not the same streak of blood we see in the Rebuilds - supporting the theory that they are a sequel of events? 




 Throughout the shows, we have seen the candidates/children as well as the EVA's numbered.  I recently noticed by the end of Rebuild 3, that some of the candidates also have Greek alphabet designations on the backs of their uniforms.

1. Shinji:  (alpha symbol on his back), meaning first, or in astronomy the brightest
2. ? I didn't notice who had beta.
3. Asuka:  (gamma symbol on her back), meaning third, or in astronomy the third brightest

In terms of "order", this contradicts who is 1st candidate/child, 3rd candidate/child, and so on.  Anyone else notice this or have any thoughts on it?

 Problem:

* Apparently Pangu doesn't like something in your iPhone profile and can't continue the Jailbreak - even though the Pangu app has been injected on your phone.  Try as many times as you want, but its never getting passed "dump caches failed" (red question marks with the progress meter at stopped 10~20%).

Solution:

1. Perform a "Clean Recovery" and create a new iPhone profile
2. Retry Pangu per instructions
3. ...
4. Profit!

HTH.  I tried everything else recommended in this subreddit, and online forums.  As soon as I tried with a fresh profile, it worked perfectly. 




 Today, case-in-point, two emergency vehicles are going north San Vincente in the 55 zone.  My traffic group is coming to a stop at Stocker St with the emergency vehicles approaching from behind.  I can see and hear them approaching.  I'm in the center lane at the head of the line, but I leave room in front of my car so I can let the guy in the front left lane pull to the right to let the emergency vehicles through.

He doesnt do it.

I yell to him in his car, trying to get his attention over the fact that he's listening to headphones.  He finally takes them off, takes a moment to open and start eating a Redvine, listens twice more to what I have been repeatedly trying to tell him - and then he tells me to "calm down."

I tell him, "dude, I left you space in front of my car so you can get out of the way!"  Meanwhile, there are other people in my lane pleading with other cars in the left lane behind me to move out of the way of the emergency vehicles.  He stares at me and will not move until all the other cars behind him have moved - wasting precious minutes for the emergency vehicles.

What the fuck is wrong with people? 



























































 They made a point to show that Asuka notices that she has similar bandages on her fingers, although not to the extent of Rei.  We saw a bit of what Rei was going through, but what happened with Asuka?  Why the girls, and not Shinji - if its a pilot-thing? 




























































































































 I almost wouldn't mind if it did its thing in the morning, but its going off for apparently no reason in the middle of the night.  Thanks for any and all ideas! 






















































 1. No mentions of anything AoS-related
2. There are the standard (2) tags after the movie: serious/continuity-related mid-credits, and a fan service one post-credits. 
3. I highly recommend AoS fans see this movie in continuity order.

Feel free to AMA, provided you use spoiler tags where applicable.  









 'nuff said 




 1. anagram of the word "keys".
1. anagram of the word "syke", and is a common misspelling of "psych" in English. In Finnish is means "pulse" or "heartbeat". 
1. a fancy way of writing "sky".
1. "Sky" in Italian is "Cielo", which can sound similar to "cello" when when spoken. (I'm not implying anything here - it just sounds similar to me)

Personally, I'm a fan of #1 since she is so adept at getting into computer systems.
 









 [In a reply to comments on another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/shield/comments/20rebg/new_clairvoyant_theory_may_contain_spoilers/cg6ir2s), I started to self-analyze background opinions I have been having since the T.A.H.I.T.I. episode, which have lead me to a branch of the original theory.

I came to the theory that Nick Fury left documentation clues about the location of Coulson's operation and the Guest House that specifically required a human interaction/element to decipher.  It wasn't anything that could be data-scraped/deciphered in a programmatic way. It required holographic projection and visual analysis of an image.  To oversimplify, this to me seems similar to a [CAPTCHA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) to inhibit programmatic automation from scraping the data.

So to summarize, The Clairvoyant couldn't see information about Coulson's operation past what would require human interaction and perception.

Following this theory, it makes me lean toward a technologically-based intelligence being at the root of the big bad.

Thoughts?

EDIT: grammar fix, changed "passed" to "past" 







































 its even better if you turn on CC. 




 That depends entirely on the style and the dojo.  20 years ago, I trained in Shotokan at a dojo that was full contact.  We beat the crap out of each other.  Granted, finding a full-contact anything in martial-arts in this day and age is difficult.

 Just in case anyone doesn't recall this image - its a screenshot from NGE ep.9 (20:35).  Its a very fast sequence of spliced/flashed images while Asuka and Shinji are coordinating their final attack against a recombined Israfel.

 Okay.  Now you gotta tell us where you are originally from that you dont know what a "two-by-four" is! 




 Seriously.  I felt like I just walked into a "creative writing" class. 









 I recently came across these tidbits, and thought some of you might find them interesting.  The first suggests multiple realities (or what some are considering a possible time-loop/divergence) for the different endings of NGE, while the second is a counter argument:

[Here's a specific extract from a cached copy of an otherwise very long and opinionated NGE faq/overview by By Brendan Jamieson](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.evaotaku.com/html/evafaq.html):

 **Q) Are the TV ending and Film ending the same conclusion to the saga?**
 
 **A) In my view - No.** (Long explanation follows)
 
 In the TV ending Shinji chose to stay with Complementation - it isn't even clear that Shinji had a choice at all. He is treated as little more than an example of the process of Complementation - which consisted if breaking down Shinji's link to reality. In the end, Shinji looks at the world of Complementation and smiling happily says "I understand! I can exist here !" He is then congratulated for his decision, by friends living and dead (Kaji), a healthy Touji with his leg still on, and even PenPen. A surreal ending scene to say the least. This ending is similar in context and theme to the ending of George Orwell's book, 1984.
 
 Conversely, the film ends in the opposite manner. Shinji does have a choice and in the last moments of the film utterly rejects Complementation precisely because it eliminates the link to reality, it establishes a false paradise. Complementation is basically a cop-out, and Shinji has matured enough to realize this. The tone at the end of the film isn't a surreal, almost drug-induced, joyful "Congratulations!" for Shinji, but the cold and harsh reality of life.
 
 This is a largely unpopular opinion of mine - so let me stress again this is in my view . However, I think the evidence is very much there to support the theory that there are two very different endings to the Evangelion story. But I do acknowledge that there is also persuasive evidence to the contrary. **For the flip side of this theory, check out MDWig's very well-put counter argument.**

Follow this link for MDWig's ["An argument for the concurrent nature of episodes 26 and 26'"](http://www.angelfire.com/anime4/mdwigs/endings.html). 




 A year or so ago, [/u/shinjieva2007](http://www.reddit.com/user/shinjieva2007) [*posted a question about this*](http://www.reddit.com/r/evangelion/comments/1dgfi9/alpha_and_lambda_why_those_two_characters_on/), which was mostly dismissed as being incorrect, concluding that the [letters on Shinji's and Kaworu's backs](http://i.imgur.com/GcumVGK.gifv) were upper () and lower () case alpha symbols.

Having recently rewatched the rebuilds, I have to disagree with the previous votes and agree with /u/shinjieva2007 that it is indeed a lambda symbol (), and I would like to bring this question up for discussion again with additional information:

The reasoning to bolster the Lambda arguement is that it is the symbol for a [cosmological constant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant).  If you look at this in regards to the time-loop/divergence theories, I think this fits well; as it implies that Kaworu is a constant observer in what is happening through the cycles - and goes along with his cryptic remarks in 3.33 that imply things are happening *again*.

The  symbol is used notably in [Einstein's field equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations) describing space-time.

Thoughts? 














 The title nails it.  I own the multiple versions of the original series as well as EOE.  I absolutely cannot stand blocky DVD subtitles.  So I ripped the subtitles for the original series as well as the directors cut episodes to stand-alone VobSub files.  I then OCR'd them into SRT so that I could play my videos with crisp truetype fonts.  No bullshit, no tagging, no modifications - just straight subtitles.

I also converted the subs for EOE.

The files have been named according to what I can scrape from TheTVDB, and use a convention that should be completely compatible with any home-theater playback software (Plex, XMBC, etc).

If anyone would like a copy of these subtitles, feel free to download them from my MEGA cloud drive:

*If you spot any errors in the OCR conversion, please let me know so I can fix them.* 



















 I'm sure this sounds really weird, but is there any significance to this?  Did I miss something in the series?  Is it a Japanese trope of some sort?  And what I mean is the symbolism of staring at fluids on ones hands (not specifically if he jerked it or whatever).

Correct me if I'm wrong, there are two visually similar scenes where Shinji is staring at fluid on his hands and having a traumatic/awakening experience.  [One scene is Rei's blood](http://oi51.tinypic.com/23h4vvr.jpg) leading to his decision to pilot Eva-01, and of course the other is [him jerking it](http://i74.photobucket.com/albums/i267/sailorstardust/NGE25Shinji01.jpg) while hovering over a comatose Asuka.

I was recently rewatching the series, and the scene with Rei's blood immediately made me think of the scene in EOE (which never occurred to me before).  Both sets of fluid-drops on the left-hand hand...   IIRC, there is also a scene where he was staring at his burnt right-hand.  Not looking at fluid on it, but staring at it nonetheless. 

I think I'm getting really bored waiting for 4.0... 




 For anyone else looking for assistance to restore purchases for either the blue (old) or white (new) versions: It's not gonna happen.  Below is an official support reply regarding failed "Pro" restores of both products that described the problem as a failure with Apple's payment system. I don't accept this excuse, as I don't have this problem restoring any other purchases in any other apps.  So if its broken with AB, then its the fault of the programmers of AB.  Yet, here I am holding my ~~di\*\*~~wallet.

 Unfortunately, since we acquired Alien Blue and released it as a new app, your old pro purchase on the old app will not transfer over.
 
 There was an in-app announcement about the acquisition and a week of free pro. We also did a day of free pro on Cyber Monday (again, with an in-app announcement). We have no way of transferring verified pro purchases that occurred in the old AB app because all transactions on iOS are handled by Apple using Apple IDs, and that information is not shared with us (even if you gave us your Apple ID we have no records to compare it with, and also no way of giving you a free purchase since we have no access to Apple's payment system).
 
 If we had a better way, we would have done it, because this is not a good experience for our users. We are really sorry for any confusion! 
 Hope this answers your question.

**For the record:**  I purchased the original Alien Blue (blue icon), as well as upgraded the new Alien Blue (white icon) for free during the free-upgrade period - and apparently, AB will not honor either previous in-app purchase. 
























 Over in /r/cordcutters, theres always a heavy argument against against smart TVs, and I understand some of the rightful points.  But, one thing I really appreciate about my smart TV is that my plex client app can direct play videos, and not require streaming/transcoding.  This is great, as it is a viewing device that puts very little load on my Plex server.

Besides PCs and smart TVs, which other DMPs that can direct play? 




 For /u/LukeBK or /u/KarmaLuke, and the moderators of this subreddit:

***First:***

I had the top comment complaining about the original "contest" thread.  I'm surprised that your account got banned. To openly disclose my own position: I didn't downvote or register any formal complaints myself; I only wanted to express my issue with the fairness of the contest to the readers of this subreddit.  But now that I see how this has turned out, I'm a bit confused as to what happened.  *I hope you get your original account reinstated - following an open disclosure to the following questions below.* 

***Questions:***

I'm disappointed that you have edited your original post, instead of adding addendums to the bottom of it with updated information.  With that, there are a number of questions that I feel need proper addressing before myself and perhaps others in this subreddit can have any faith in what is going on here.

1. You promoted this "contest" in other subreddits, pointing back to /r/cordcutters. You may not realize this, but it gave the appearance of an official /r/cordcutters contest.  I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt on that one.  *Who on the moderation team of /r/cordcutters did you contact to notify of, or preferably get permission to advocate a contest?*

2. *How did you acquire the original Tablo for this contest?  Was it given to you with the purpose of and or the permission to re-sell/re-gift?*

3. *Do you have any direct or indirect connection to anyone at Tablo or Nuvyyo, for the marketing/selling/distribution of their products?*

4. Lets be honest: Turning this into a facebook contest was sketchy, when many are aware of facebook as a marketing and data-collection platform.  *Why did you choose facebook as a platform for a simple name-in-hat selection process?*

5. You say you are sorry for everything, and that to make up for the kerfuffle you are giving away another Tablo out-of-pocket to "make things right" for people with messy media setups of the original giveaway criteria.  An innocent mistake can easily be forgiven, and I'm not trying to accuse you of anything, but this is behavior is somewhat suspect. *If everyone got a fair entry into the facebook "like" contest, why are you giving away equipment if you have no stake in something else going on here?*  

Thank you for your time and honesty. 




 I purchased the original Alien Blue app, and I also upgraded early for free the Reddit placement app to the "pro" version.  I cannot get either app to restore my purchase after a reinstall.  

The problem presented itself when I switched iPhones without the ability to perform a backup/restore.  There appears to be some sort of glitch when it tried to contact the iTunes server.

 *Connecting to iTunes. Please wait...*

Any thoughts/ideas? 



















 * Example subreddit: /r/ComicWalls (I'm a mod there)
* Browsers tested: Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer
* Notes: This occurs with RES and all script/ad blockers disabled or otherwise not installed.

If I logout, I see all the appropriate subreddit flair.  If I login, I don't see any link flair spans that should include class="linkflairlabel".

When I compare the source html: When I am logged in, there are span classes completely missing that would display the required CSS for link flair.  However, these classes are present in the source HTML when I am logged out.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

edit: **This is solved**. "Show link flair" in the reddit settings somehow got disabled. **Thank you everyone who looked at this**. 














 1. Currently, none of the channels are in Full-HD (1080p).  The highest resolution observed was standard HD (720p). Some channels are below the HD threshold (e.g. El Rey).
2. 802.11g wifi works with a strong signal, but is noticeably the worst experience I tested.  The interface is the slowest, with thumbnails and data-loading taking the longest.  As expected, upscaling from the initial SD stream up to HD takes the longest over 802.11g. Its annoying.
3. Shows and commercials are separate streams and suffer from buffering and quality up-scaling just like when a channel initially loads.  This quality re-buffering is exacerbated with slower poorer quality connections and slower devices, as expected.
4. The interface speed difference between my Roku 2 XS and my PC/MAC is very noticeable.  The Roku performance for the Sling TV app is quite poor overall.  I realize the Roku 2 XS is slightly dated, but I think this is the worst performing app I have run on it.  Its horribly sluggish when changing channels and when trying to FF/RW on-demand programming. I had not considered a need to upgrade it until now.
5. If using a TV for your display, and if your TV supports it, your viewing experience can be drastically improved by turning up settings that govern Digital and MPEG Noise Reduction.  Motion interpolation settings (e.g. Clear/Auto Motion on Samsung) can further clarify the image to make it look sharper more "cable-quality like".  Stock TV settings, IMO leave the video looking like they are YouTube videos with low bitrates.  There is something about it that screams internet streaming video, especially when watching on a 60" TV.  Naturally, its not as obvious an issue on smaller screens.  The TV noise and motion settings can counteract the current bit-rate quality issues until hopefully the overall service quality is upgraded.  With slightly modified settings TV settings, the image quality was in my and my SO's opinion drastically improved.

HTH - feel free to AMA and I'll try to answer or test as best as I can. 









 Like a Roku with built-in DVR support, or something similar?  With the recent introduction of Sling TV, I'm interested in a DVR device (or similar solution) that can support recording shows for later viewing.

But it seems that in taking this cut-cord approach, I'm having total recall of VCR use in the 80's: With having to have the TV on, and on the correct channel independently, while the VCR is time programmed to record whatever happens to be active on the TV.

*Any future news or thoughts on current solutions would be greatly appreciated.* 




 Sounds like only 1 police car in pursuit at the moment. 




 I've been ignoring this sub because the rig I vector with has a hardware issue, and I just realized that I completely forgot to post something here to let anyone know.  I've also been traveling a bit - but, thats still no excuse - just a bit of reason.  I mostly feel like I'm talking to myself here.  I know, vectors are a niche.

So, I'm not ignoring any requests/posts - *but I actually am*.  I should have the rig fixed soon, and will catch-up with any requests/posts in standard FIFO. 



































































































 This evening I took a ~24in. length of left-over coax and decided to create a small antenna for my bedroom TV that previously has just been used for my Roku over wi-fi.  I didn't use any formal guides for making a DIY antenna.  I dont have any particular reason for going with the antenna shape that I did, other than I wanted it to be compact and not rely on a rig of some sort to be attached to. I just stripped the wire, and came up with a shape to try based on whatever I could recall from electrical and electronics courses I took 20 years ago.

Most of the stations I am interested in came in great. I was shocked.  Broadcast location is 21.5mi. away on a mountain top. Not pure line-of-site, but am facing that direction.

Pictures with additional descriptions:  [http://imgur.com/a/NE3oU](http://imgur.com/a/NE3oU)

As shown, this antenna is strapped to the back of the TV and sits about 6 inches from the far-right edge of a window.  The window has blinds and a shade in front of it as well.  But, the window (and subsequently the antenna) do face the direction of the TV broadcast sources - although not open LOS.

Am I crazy?  Lucky?  Should I try a larger configuration?

Edit :grammar 









 I found it very interesting to see what they changed between the versions.  Its not just shimmed in scenes.  They made certain things grittier and dirtier looking. They swapped in/out things in the background.   They changed facial expressions.  They changed the direction/orientation of bodies/faces.

It all gives a different impression to the scene, even for those scenes that the dialog did not change in. 




 I'm a recent convert from the world of XBMC - so please bear with some assumptions I may make below.  I really like Plex and am grateful for what the community has done with it.  I'm just trying to get through some learning and adaptation issues:

My current obstacle is dealing with the apparent low quality scraped images that Plex is keyed into (even the images for menu items: Movies, Television, etc).  I'm not seeing 1080 quality anywhere - even in the menu system background images (ala viewing via Samsung TV). The web interface doesn't highlight this lack of image quality so much, since the backgrounds are behind an (presumably 50% opaque?) image curtain that flattens/dulls the image.  But I can still see (via page inspection) that none of these images are actually 1080.

I thought Plex was pulling images from similar/same resources as XBMC, but this doesn't seem to be the case in terms of quality.  Id rather not allow it to download anything below a certain threshold, which would allow me to more easily identify and download the images manually.

Since Plex does not allow easy local access to the cached artwork for direct modification, any ideas, pointers, caveats would be greatly appreciated. 

Please dont take my current annoyance as any type of disparity against Plex. I know its based on XBMC, but I do also realize its a completely different animal that I have to accept and get some things out of my mind about it. :-) 














 Is it only certain types of objects that are applicable, or is it only a matter of the amount of energy involved? 














 I think the web digital stream looks better (higher-def).  Like last year, I think the ABC o-t-a stream looks softer.  I actually prefer to watch the Hulu stream because of this (yep, I wat a day to watch what I feel is a better copy). Does anyone else? 





























 So far we've seen Night Watch (2004) and Day Watch (2006) make it to the big screen under Timur Bekmambetov's direction.  Are there still any chances of plans to continue the series?

 Excited to check it out since its re-opening, and figuring they have all the kinks worked out by now; me and the SO went to Tom's this evening.  It was disappointing. :-(

The food was OK, but not as good as either of us remembered it.  We both got the staple fish and chips, but were not pleased by the end of the meal.  The fish is a different style cut, and the batter just didn't seem the same.   Also, the chips (really skinny fries), while tasting quite good to start-off, turned out to be overly salty.

The special Mexican-Monday menu was a bit off-putting.  Dont get me wrong, I like Mexican food - but I went to an Irish pub to get, food/drink specific to an Irish pub.  Thankfully, fish and chips are always on the menu regardless.

edit for clarity:  The menu is 90%+ mexican food on Monday's only.  Its a swapped-out special menu. 
























 I have tried looking for a solution to this, but cannot find one - but maybe someone here is familiar with the issue: *iTunes is improperly trimming the displayed cover for albums* that have, for what I call "soft borders" - meaning a lot of empty (any color) space around the boarder, or even if the text is simply soft in appearance.

Examples:

http://imgur.com/a/a12mc

Thanks for any advice!  I figure I will have to edit the covers in question and test adding "hard pixels to the corners" in hopes that iTunes won't trim them...

 ## What is reddit, really?  

* Don't think of reddit as one giant community. This site is made up of "sub"reddits, which are all their own communities. Every single post you see on this site belongs to its own community, with its own set of users, and with its own set of rules. reddit provides you an easy-to-use interface for managing what posts you see by letting you subscribe or unsubscribe from certain subreddits.  

* By making an account, you are automatically subscribed to a set of ["default" subreddits](http://i.imgur.com/4PxSX4e.png) which are a set of highly popular communities that the administrators of this site feel would give the average person an interesting first experience.  

* Don't like one or more of these default subreddits? Use the "unsubscribe" button on the sidebar, and start customizing your reddit front page! Find subreddits that interest *you*. Many subreddits feature lists of "similar subreddits" that will help you find other awesome places to subscribe to. Looking for a subreddit but you just don't know its name? Try /r/findareddit! Finally, try setting up a [multi-reddit](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/06/browse-future-of-reddit-re-introducing.html) to categorize your subreddit list even further! 

---  

## Tips for your account.  

* [See and change your preferences.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/) Customize how many [comments](http://i.imgur.com/ZDka3tA.png) show up, what kind of [posts](http://i.imgur.com/FqnC5e2.png) show up, [and more](http://i.imgur.com/vFrZ1C9.png)!  

* [Verify your e-mail.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/update/) If you don't do this and you lose your password, you will have no way to log back onto that account. Ever. Please do this!  

* Karma is a point system that lets you know how your submissions or comments are doing. The more karma your post has, the more people have upvoted it. Generally a higher karma count on a post means that the community of that subreddit found your post valuable and interesting. Your karma is logged on your user page on the top right. **Please note that self-posts earn you no karma.** Only comments and link-posts do.

## What is the sidebar?  

* The ["sidebar"](http://i.imgur.com/OVtMd4K.png) is the list of information pertaining to a specific subreddit. At the top you will find a link to submit a post and a link to search the subreddit. It also contains the link to "subscribe/unsubscribe" from that subreddit. Underneath that it generally lists the rules, guidelines, relevant information, similar subreddits, etc.  

    **Note:** many mobile reddit apps require you to press a certain button for the sidebar to show up. Every subreddit has a sidebar. Please don't forget to look for it even if your app doesn't immediately show it! [Here's an image showing where to find it on common reddit apps.](http://imgur.com/a/kgwuy#0)

* You should always read the sidebar before submitting a post to any subreddit, and if you don't understand a rule message the moderators to ask. This ensures that your post stays on the subreddit, as rule-breaking posts will likely be removed.

* Have a question about a submission to a particular subreddit? Ask the moderators there! [Here's an image](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) that shows you where you can typically find the link to message the mods.  

---

## Who are moderators? What do they do?  

* Each subreddit is a community with its own focus. The mods are volunteers who ensure the subreddit stays true to its purpose by enforcing set rules. For example, /r/android is a subreddit dedicated to discussion of the Android operating system. Anything not directly related to Android is removed by its moderators. Similarly, /r/apple is a subreddit dedicated to discussing Apple and its products.  

* Moderators have the power to approve or remove any comments or submissions made to *only the subreddits they moderate.* They can also issue a ban for users on their subreddit. Moderators enforce the rules laid out in the sidebar, so if you follow all the rules in the sidebar you should be good!  

## Who are admins? What do they do?  

* [Meet the admins.](http://www.reddit.com/about/team) The admins are like super-moderators. They have all the abilities of moderators across every subreddit plus more. They are paid employees of the site and they ensure that the site runs smoothly for all users.

* The admins are generally hands-off when it comes to individual subreddits, letting the moderators and the community decide how its run. **However,** the admins will enforce the [rules of reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules) on every subreddit. Be familiar with these rules. Failure to follow these rules may earn you a **sitewide ban**, or the closing down of a subreddit.  

---

## What is reddiquette?  

* [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) is an **informal** set of guidelines to follow before commenting or submitting on reddit. As reddit has grown, certain behaviors have been frowned upon and other behaviors have been encouraged. reddiquette spells out these behaviors so you aren't left wondering why your posts aren't well-received. You might not be banned not following reddiquette, but you will probably be showered in downvotes if you don't.  

---  

## Help! What happened to my post?  

* reddit is a huge forum with millions of users. Many posts are made here every day. Many, many posts are made with the intention to spam or harass other users. Other posts just don't fit the subreddit. Moderators have to filter through these posts every day to ensure their subreddit stays on topic and free of hostility. Some moderators use bots to help them report posts, some moderators do it all themselves. Every subreddit is different. If you find your post not showing up in the subreddit, your best bet is to ask the moderators there why it's not showing up. *Please note: when you message the moderators, ALL moderators can read it! It's a shared inbox!*  

    * *I can still see my post but others say they can't?*  
    Nothing is really removed from reddit, if a mod removes something it is de-listed for others to see. You can still see it with a direct link.  

    * *My post was removed because it was spam? What gives?*
    Spam is a tricky subject, reddit has several base rules but much of it is left for moderators to decide. reddit's [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq) has a good section explaining it.

---  

## I have a great idea for an existing subreddit!

* Awesome! [Message the moderators](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) so you can talk to them  

## I have a great idea for reddit as a site!

* Awesome too! Post it in /r/ideasfortheadmins  

## What if I don't like the moderators or how the subreddit is run?  

* That's okay, reddit was built to handle just that! First though, make sure that you talk to the moderators of that subreddit just to be sure there aren't any misunderstandings, or if you can't just compromise. Otherwise, make your own community! [Here is an excellent guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/mod101) for starting and moderating your own subreddit.  

* Moderators are people, too, so if you want your voice heard consider messaging them politely with your concerns. We care about the communities we help run and would hate to see users leave because of something that we can help fix!  


---

## What if I need help with something else?  

* Try /r/help for general help on reddit. /r/askmoderators can also help you out if you need to ask mods about anything.  

## I think I found a bug.

* Uh oh. If you are using an application or extension, most have a subreddit you can post in! (/r/RESIssues, /r/alienblue, /r/redditisfun). If you found a bug with reddit itself, post it to /r/bugs (more serious issues should be sent directly to the reddit security team: see the /r/bugs sidebar for contact information.)  


##Other Subreddits of Note

* Other good subreddits to check out for help with various topics are /r/Modhelp, /r/Modnews, /r/ChangeLog, /r/Blog, and /r/Announcements.

 For years I have come across references from various sources alluding to Adam being the second angel created by God.  [This can also be found in the evageeks wiki](http://wiki.evageeks.org/Adam#Allusions):

 *The second book of Enoch refers to Adam as the Second Angel. In NGE, Adam is the First Angel, and Lilith, not Adam, is the Second Angel. However, all humans descend from the Second Angel, whether Adam in Enoch, or Lilith in Evangelion.*

This has always annoyed me because its always been listed without a proper citation/reference.  So, I recently went on a hunt to find out what the real deal is about it, and found a [*Google Books source*](https://books.google.com/books?id=Wgk3AAAAMAAJ lpg=PA40 ots=XmQ3ouHfu3 dq=%22secrets%20of%20enoch%22%20%22second%20angel%22 pg=PA40#v=onepage q=%22secrets%20of%20enoch%22%20%22second%20angel%22 f=false) of the Book of Enoch scripture detailing God's creation of Adam:

 [11] And I placed him upon the earth like a second angel in an honourable great and glorious way

 [12] And I made him a ruler to rule upon the earth and to have My wisdom

I don't think any of this substantiates the book of Enoch/Adam/Lilith connection.

Thoughts? 




 and yet you are so sensitive about it.  have fun on the internet! 




 well, you're taking a light-hearted jab (an excuse to say *anta baka* on this sub) the wrong way.  But I would still say that best girl posts traditionally come with pics to share - promoting a pic swap which almost always ends in a posting of Ramiel as best girl.

 Not sure what you are saying here in contrast to what I said.  I said it wasn't a single shot.  I didnt say anything about it being chloe or not.  




 I find Time Warner to be the most cost-effective (I cant find a better deal) option for 20/2 mb service.  The service has been good, with only a handful of experienced late-night outages in the past couple of years.  Streaming and downloading has been consistent.

I'm sure others have their complaints, but over-all my experience has been good.  I quarterly check for better deals, and can never find one. 




 I think we still have plenty of our own specific deaths and issues to protest, before doing one specifically for Freddie Gray.  I think Baltimore has FG covered for now.  LA protesting something on the other side of the country is a distraction to protesting against our own numerous local problems. 




 I thought that the compass will direct *whoever is using it* to the direction of what they desire the most?  I'm pretty sure this is demonstrated across the movie franchise when other people are in possession of the compass.

 Sooo many additional train routes used to exist all over the country.  You could shake your head for years reviewing all of the routes terminated and tracks ripped-up or covered. 




 AFAIK, its mostly because its non-standard equipment that needs to be rented and operated by a special op.

And yea, you also have the added time of setting up a shot multiple times in a choreographed manner.  I'm not sure what you mean by training beyond that. 




 its called motion tracking.  that was not a single-sequence.

 **Example Problem:**  Custom sort order all Marvel Cinematic Universe titles like so:

|Title|Sort Title|
|:-|:-|
|Captain America: The First Avenger|Marvel 1|
|Iron Man|Marvel 4|
|Iron Man 2|Marvel 5|
|Thor|Marvel 7|
|The Incredible Hulk|Marvel 8|
|The Avengers|Marvel 10|
|Iron Man 3|Marvel 12|
|Thor 2|Marvel 15|
|Captain America: The Winter Soldier|Marvel 17|
|Guardians of the Galaxy|Marvel 19|

**Displayed order ends up being:**

1. Captain America: The First Avenger
1. The Avengers
1. Iron Man 3
1. Thor 2
1. Captain America: The Winter Soldier
1. Guardians of the Galaxy
1. Iron Man
1. Iron Man 2
1. Thor
1. The Incredible Hulk

**So, what's the problem?**  Plex is numerically ordering as 1, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 4, 5, 7, 8.  This is apparent in the raw movies order as well as any filtered displays such as collections.  Its numerically linking against the first number.

**Work-around:** Prefix any single-digit numbers with a 0, and Plex will display it in the correct numerical order.  So 1 as 01, 2 as 02, and so on...

 Because proper understanding of word definitions are important, so incorrect assumption are not made. 

Yet apparently lots of people took needless offense to that. 

The proper definition illustrates that it has less to do with the person doing it, and more with the circumstance and context for which it was done.  




 he means that the "editors" dont do it, which is true.  its a vfx house thats doing it.

 I don't have an issue with a critical opinion. It's what hear as a horrible inflection found in many bloggers who cannot seem to curb a condescending attitude that thy project when giving an opinion. It's an audible influence to give further sway that not only are what they are saying is correct, but you should feel dumb for not knowing it. 

It's something that you more often hear coming from teenagers. And not to sound sexist, but in my experience, teenage girls.

 This is an interesting concept, but tracker lists aren't just about putting a blank line between listings.  Blank lines are meant to separate tracker *tiers*.

Tiers are groupings of tracker URLs that fall within the dominion of the same hostname address - in order of connection preference.

Example of how tiered-grouping works:

    udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969/announce
    
    udp://open.demonii.com:6969/announce
    http://open.demonii.com:6969/announce

 I'm not sure I understand where this effort is going.  Having a directory map can be useful when you are organizing large amounts of files, but I don't see the value if this is for generating a download queue for re-downloading content.

imho this is making more required effort - not less.

I would be concentrating on organizing magnet or .torrent info, so that could be directly fed into a client like utorrent. 




 Lost Coast too. 




 This might be a more direct alternative for windows batch:

    FOR /F "tokens=*" %%I IN ('DIR /B /S "*.avi" "*.mp*" "*.mkv" 2^NUL') DO @ECHO %%~nI

This gives you file names without file extensions.

 Not on my Samsung TV they dont.  If the external subs are SRT, then I dont transcode.

edit: The crucial part of being able to avoid transcoding with subtitles is to be using a plex client that is capable of *overlaying* subtitles as opposed to *embedding* them into the video stream.

 I was in agreement with everything until the last paragraph:

 Ultimately, The Joker arguably carries the whole thing off just to prove how clever he is, but its difficult to claim youre an agent of chaos when you put quite that much work into making sure that absolutely everything goes your way  even if its never entirely quite clear exactly what your way is.

The Joker has historically been a criminal mastermind who revels in the chaos he causes around him.  I dont see how that has anything to do with the fact that he has multi-leveled formulated plans.

 Some outstanding points:

1. we dont know anything about the video encoding/bitrates you are trying to playback.
2. we dont know anything about the throughput from your NAS.
3. You say the videos dont playback, and so you "invariably rip a higher bitrate version"?

Some things to do:

1. Get file transfer stats to/from your NAS.  On windows, this is a very small/convenient tool:  http://www.totusoft.com/lanspeed1.html
2. Test against another Plex client.

 Does this happen with direct play or transcoding?  I have a Samsung UN60H6350 (quad-core), and I am able to playback highly-encoded videos just fine - but saying that in a non-technical manner is kind of meaningless.  Specs are what will tell you if something is a yay or nay in terms of compatibility.

Can you give us any additional details about the encoding of the videos?  Are you making them yourself?  Perhaps you can re-encode in a manner that is more compatible with your specific TVs decoding capabilities.

As an example, I can easily direct-play across a 802.11g WLAN from a c2007 Sony VAIO Core 2 Duo - and that thing is an outdated piece of crap.  I can transcode too, but it beats the hell out of the processor (100% pegged).   If having to transcode from it, I run scripts to stop all sorts of things from running on it (tasks and services) to drop it to the greatest amount of processor availability I can.

I honestly think your problem is with the coding of the videos specifically.  Something is probably out of spec there.

 You need to get the carpet properly tested to show/prove allergens.  Otherwise, what you are saying is just lip-service.  Document the bedbugs as well, and show them the documentation - *dont just talk about it*.   They should be highly motivated about the bedbugs because of the risk of infestation and spreading.  The allergens as a proved health risk should also motivate them.

You can then use that same documentation against them if you decide to escalate the matter.

No cropping on my part - whats shown is the full extent of the image (it was a still image, not a moving image).

Its from one of the Evangelion "rebuild" movies, and is an image that is shown very briefly during some dramatic dialog, so I cant help but wonder if there is some hidden meaning/text that goes beyond simply "crew room" or "crew compartment".

I wonder that sometimes a word or two in Japanese means one thing, but has similar pronunciations that mean something else that is more devious.

 Note, BiteSMS's contact address is:

U0065, 3rd Floor, Jalan OKK Awang Besar, Wilayah Persekutuan, 87007 Labuan, Malaysia

This is a *front* address for many various "companies" that you can find online.  I'm not saying this un-legitimizes BiteSMS, but IMHO its sketchy for a legit company to share a mailing address.

I loved their product, I paid for their product, and I miss it.  But I dunno to what extent I would call them a "legit company" outside of a couple of devs. 




 If I couldn't imagine it before, I can now! 




 FWIW, we dont know if he's dead-dead.  The death was offscreen (which is weird when dealing with focal characters), and our only reference to it is a photo. 




 How was it determined that folder was the problem?  I'm assuming it was an issue with something that was in the folder, and not the folder name itself? 




 Who doesn't know about the source of such wonderful dramas like Downton Abbey and Broadchurch, and colorful cars shows like Top Gear!?

 Thanks for the link to the MW-1 info! 




 And used in *every single* Spike Lee movie. 




 When I finally saw it, I literally shuddered.  *That was fucking weird*. 




 any additional info on what is being dispensed here?  I'm guessing something anti-personnel? 




 I dont have the time to go mark time frames for you.  Believe what you want.  I hear that Roswell, NM is lovely this time of year. 




 For those keeping track, this is just about the same exact location as the M3.5 on 2015-04-13 "Windsor Hills".

Both of these under the oilfields at La Brea and Slauson.
 




 What was erroneous about the directory name? 




 Insanity Wolf?  Did you mom get her ass beat for this remark? 




 This must have been blowing so many of those dancers minds. 




 ohh, totally wooshed me on that.  ty. 




 That sounds logical, but in this sub, I really dont find that to be true - aside from the negativity regarding something Marvel aspect.

You should be hive-mind allowed to express a passionate negative opinion. 




 Ahh, just when I've thought I've seen everything!

 what was it? 




 Amazing, I understood all of that expect for "PoC".  What have I missed? 




 I dont even know what your talking about (cause I dont look back and track votes), so who cares.   




 Yay!  I care! 




 Yes.  You either boost or retard the audio to approximate an audio level that is consistent with your volume. 




 In a long tracked shot like this, the cuts are always when a head is turned just as a speedup takes place or just took place to take advantage of motion blurring.  Thats when you have stunt actors swapped in/out and or simply have different takes combined.  

The sequence looks awesome, but this is not a single take.  Its tracked, and is a composite. 




 Thanos and Ultron are on different levels. 




 I hate that this sub downvotes opinions.  You paraphrased what my GF said last night after watching AoU - that she was disappointed that Ultron was not more bad-ass.

Then I had to turn in a "well, in the comics" dork and explain how/why he really is, etc.  :-/ 




 This is a great chart:

 Reminds me of the Eiger Sanction. 




 Exactly.  You let people pull that shit, in front of other people, you are just asking to get rolled in the future.  If he's a dealer, he had to *keep it real*.  I hate the expression, but it is what it is. 




 You take someones shit (whatever that may be), and dont give it back or give them the money for it, you deserve a punch in the face. 




 maybe a known groper in that area, and someone planned some justice?  its obviously not first-hand CNN video. 




 Just live. 




 This has been a long-standing unaddressed complaint on the XBMC side for years.  The best thing we accomplished on XBMC was individual audio settings per-video.   Meaning that per-video, you could set audio increase/decrease settings to normalize the title to your default audio settings.  Its a bit annoying, but it gets the job done and you only have to tweak the problematic titles. 




 I hope Marvel has a HQ digital-double of this man. 




 Yea, but I added something new - so go fuck yourself. 




 Holy crap - I was really young at the time, so I didnt realize the mother got a life sentence for that incident.  At least that was eventually dismissed. 




 Then you just upvote it.  Everything else you post is a waste of time unless it adds something new to the conversation.

 Tell your wife.  Not telling her could backfire on you in so many currently inconceivable ways. 




 for very slow?  that sounds completely acceptable.  there are setting you could push that would make it take much longer than that. 




 Gotta respect an old lady that can still take a shot to the dome. 




 Proper Indian. 




 Toby Keith doesn't want to shower.  Toby Keith wants to hunt! 




 I dont want to steal anyone's thunder or in-progress discussion, so please visit the details of a flag-based protest at Harvard University here:

I love the idea of this, and I think it would only further help the discussion if we saw this happen nation-wide. 




 Oh, totally.  I'm just befulldled why I've seen various texts that insist on shimming in this Adam is second angel bit.  I mean, its even made its way into print. 




 OMG!  :-D 




 payment plans of any sort always screw you.  but, sometimes thats all people can afford. 




 Historically, organizations get more done with blackmales.

 If its too expensive of a bulk purchase for you, you can pay $19.99/mo over 2 years (with the same lifetime service):

 Wow!  Someone laying in their backyard on a blanket/towel??  Holy shit dude.  How ever did you contain yourself!? 




 Its so awesome to see the group of doctors/staff laughing as this is being performed.  The shit that they must have to deal with... 




  this post says it all

literally.  are you a novelist? 




 I don't take that as a joke.  Its a common correlation that is noticed during the spring.

Although there are many months that are recorded to have nearly the same crime statistics year-round, many graphs show a dip in crime during the coldest months of winter (about 2 months worth) which then slowly build through the spring and then plateau until the next deep winter drop. 




 That quote is not in that PDF.  Its a quote from another reddit thread (which seems to since be missing/edited, but is partially visible via a Google search):
