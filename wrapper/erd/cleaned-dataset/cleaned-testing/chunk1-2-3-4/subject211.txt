 I've been a member of theistic satanism for a little under a year now. [Here's a helpful list of demons](http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/HELP.html) And [How to summon them](http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/DEMONOLATRY.html) 




 I would choose half-life 3 and release the Game files to everyone on the internet. Hey, I might go to prison but HL3 would come at last. 




 You should post this to /r/techsupportgore 




 Oh my god. I remember this. It is sooooooo hilarious. 




 I want to get into the game as it seems fun but I know nothing of how to get into it. What do I do first? Buy a set? what set would you recommend for a beginner? Do I need any special knowledge to host a game with some friends or would it all be in the manual? How much would it cost? 




 I'm prettyy sure he was gonna do HL2 regardless  




 I do, just thought everyone would like to see this. 









 My guess is that this is some kind of attempt at having an english name. I know in many parts of asia it's considered high class to use a little english inter-mixed with whatever the local language is. This was probably some proverb or something with shoddy translation. 




 Marcus. Fallout 2 




 I snapped the UE up for $3 during the last summer sale. It could've been that or an overpriced coffee from starbucks that morning. I was happy with my choice. 




 Pfft peasants

*opens new vegas and enter's player.additem 00123054 1000*

I. Won. 




 I admit defeat. 




 The hammer and sickle design was the symbol of the soviet union representing the two main jobs in the union and giving power to the proletariat.

China never had that design. Also. I'm not even sure if the soviet union ever existed in the fallout universe meaning that that symbol might not even exist.

Anyone who saw you with it would thing your crazy.

Just saying :/  




 Thanks! I'm gonna experiment with adding other custom sounds for other playthrough's. Thanks so much! 




 Andrew Ryan. 









 How to change hit sounds? I'm currently playing a game with an un-armed character called Ken. Fist of the north rawr. Using the fist of the north rawr gauntlet as my weapon to destroy my enemies.

My question is this. How do I change the sound a weapon makes upon contact with an NPC? I looked in my steam FO:NV folder and couldn't find a folder for weapon sounds. If anyone knows than it would be much appreciated to tell me how.

(I plan on changing the hit sound for the fist of the north rawr weapon to the fast punching sound from the fist of the north star movie.) 




 That's it. Your story's over. You've walked out of the land of the living and into the halls of history and legend. (Of course you could also try another playthrough for a new faction.) 




 /r/Fallout 




 ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN! CHOO CHOO 




 "FOR CANADA!" 




 I bet a laser pistol would turn out awesome. You might also try to make T-51 B or T-45 D Power helmet. 




 Speech. Speech is the most over powered skill in any game ever. 




 Mass effect? this is my decision making in real life 




 If I were you I would forgo the risk of software/hardware incompatibilities in the the future and print all the photo's on some high quality paper, Dig a hole in the ground. Put the paper in a waterproof and lightproof container, bury it and come back in 40 years 




 To me this doesn't sound like a problem. 




 [This](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/The_Nearly_Ultimate_Fallout_2_Guide) Is a pretty good guide that doesn't spoil the game to much. 




 Shoot me a PM, I can't say I'd be much help as an editor as my grammer is quite horrible but I consider myself rather knowledgeable in terms of lore. 




 This is not the suggestions thread. this for the challenge's posted above. 




 Try updating your video drivers sadly I can't direct you to the website you would do that at as that list is a list of possible specs and not absolute ones.

But say you got the model with the GeForce GT625 2GB then try searching "GeForce GT625 2GB video driver updates" into google without the quotation marks. To find out which card you have open up your start bar and right click on "My computer" on the drop down menu click properties and the window that comes up should have an option somewhere that says "Device manager"* click on that and expand the menu that says display adapters. Take the name that appears there and search google for video driver updates for that card. Install the updates and all of your games will run smoother not only NV.

*If your using win 8 then use [this guide](http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows-8/a/device-manager-windows-8.htm) 




 This sounds like a pretty good idea. And once fallout 4 is released and a large influx of new people start playing 3/NV then it could serve as some form of guide for beginners.

I might as well contribute a tip myself.

Whenever your going through the wasteland at early levels, always pick up any junk you see so long as it doesn't over encumber you. You can always sell it for some caps. Even seemingly worthless things like dinner plates can help you when your saving up for that new gun. 




 Freddie mercury. 




 Teamfortess athlon.  




 Mother ship zeta is my favorite FO3 DLC and Old world blues is my favorite DLC ever. Maybe it's something about using all those sci-fi weapons but for some reason I've always been attracted to those DLC out of the bunch that were released for 3 and NV.  




 TIL that most of the worlds military's eat better than me. 




 Not quite as good as a horse but quite fun lookling. 




 The unfinished jeb. 




 Holy shit, this kangaroo is better looking then me.

 The room should be on the list. 
























 What the sidebar was talking about was how many parts of our culture talk about satanism in a way that makes people think it's all about sacrificing virgins and eating animals hearts. You can see this is the way satanism is presented by many media outlets who just want to make a quick buck and sensationalize our faith. hence the "hollywood style depictions" line.

The message wasn't you shouldn't be allowed to but rather that's not what most sects are all about. If that's what you as an individual do as a way to express yourself then I'm not going to stop you for the express reason of "That's not what satanism is about." Though I am ideologically opposed to sacrifice myself because of moral reason's. I'm not going to stop you.

TL;DR It's not saying you can't. It's saying that the sensationalized hollywood version of satanism isn't what every satanist is about. 




 This is a thread for any questions you might have about this sub or satanism in general. Feel free to post any questions you have down below and I'll respond to them promptly. 




 I've been a theistic satanist for a while now. If you need any help understanding anything feel free to PM me. 




 that game still gave me nightmare's for a while after plying it. 




 Goodbye sleep..... never gonna see you again.
 




 That doesn't change the fact that this game doesn't look nearly as good as most on PC and yet he calls it "One of the best looking games ever" 









 Even back then the graphics were superior to the xbone. 




 I'm pretty sure most of the spiders will end up starving to death without their mommy. 




 No, not even the release date. Just the Gman's voice and a lambda. 




 of course this would kinda work both ways after all, the new Gordon probably has a similar mindset to old Gordon so old Gordon could guess what new Gordon is gonna do. Also, remember new Gordon would've forgotten alot about his past self. 




 I see where the confusion would come from. But I'd like to add that future Gordon wouldn't know what past gordon would do in the battle. So future gordon wouldn't know past gordon is sneaking up behind him ready to smash his head in with a crowbar. 




 The reason I thought this was fair was because old Gordon is waayyy better equipped. I mean, new Gordon has only *one* energy based weapon which is the pulse rifle and the secondary fire is his only energy weapon. 




 The opponents:

Gordon freeman from HL1:

* A scientist with a PhD in theoretical physics from M.I.T working at black mesa research facility in new mexico. he is a highly intelligent individual with enough brains to out think an entire alien invasion. He has about average physical strength though he seems to rely on his H.E.V suit for a lot of it.

* The H.E.V suit or hazardous environment suit full-body set of armor that protects from radiation, chemicals, bullets, and falling. It has a built in morphene and anti-venom dispenser as well as a gieger counter, zoom in feature, and flashlight. It allows a human to lift heavier object, sprint faster and longer, and even hold their breath for longer.



 Gordon Freeman from the end of half-life 2 episode 2:

* Similar to the on from HL1 but with more experience, also if he were to get his hands on the old Gordon's weapons he could use them perfectly whereas old Gordon couldn't do the same.

* The H.E.V suit has been modified to use auxiliary electricity from a small self contained generator. This allows him to run faster and swim longer. His flashlight uses yet another power source that can last for around 5 minutes. The upgraded suit also features improved armor and zoom enhancement.
 



The weapons of original Gordon are:

* a Glock 9mm pistol. (drawing from the same ammo as his SMG)

* a .357 magnum 6 round revolver with a speed loader.

* a Franchi-Spas 12 pump-action bottom loading 12 gauge shotgun.

* an MP5 submachine gun with a 50 round mag and a small on. contact grenade launcher mounted below the main barrel. (uses the same ammo as the pistol)

* 10 five second frag grenades.

* 5 remote detonation satchel charge's with detonator.

* 5 laser-tripwire mines.

* a laser-guided RPG with 5 explosive rockets.

* a crossbow with sedative darts and a long range scope.

* a gauss gun which can be charged to fire extremely dangerous energy energy beams capable of taking out a helicopter in one shot.

* a gluon gun which  fires a steady beam of high density energy, only has enough ammo to fire for around ten seconds.

* a hive-hand, a weapon used by aliens which fires small tracking bullets one at a time or rapid fires 8 non-tracking bullet's quickly, can only fire 8 bullets at any time but bullets are quickly regenerated.

* snark's, small alien insects which, when thrown go after an enemy and bit them, they explode after 10-15 seconds doing damage to all around them. though there is a chance they'll go after the user.

* And of course the classic crowbar which can be used for anything from breaking locks to opening crates to smashing skulls in.

The weapon's of the new Gordon are:

* A crowbar, simple, efficient, beautiful.

* A USP match 9mm semi-automatic pistol.

* A .357 magnum 6-shot revolver with speed loader.

* A Franchi-Spas 12 pump-action bottom loading 12 gauge shot gun.

* An MP7 SMG with a 45 round magazine and grenade launcher attached beneath barrel.

* A zero-point energy field manipulator, (or gravity gun for short) can pick up large and heavy objects and launch them.

* An overwatch standard issue pulse-rifle, Fires high caliber rounds at a high speed, extremely accurate, can also fire a ball of enrgy which disintegrates any living think it touches and should it fail to do that it bounces around off surfaces and explodes after a few seconds.

* An energy crossbow which fires a super-heated piece of medal at long range, has an extremely accurate scope.

* 5 MK3A2 high explosive grenades.

* A laser guided RPG with 3 rockets, capable of taking down a gunship in 3 shots.

* An antlion pheropod which can be used to control antlions to make them attack anything the user wish's.


The arena:

The opponents start out in a flat sandy field with a few antlions under it which are *not* in mating season.(they're not agressive just because you walk on sand) Surrounding the fields is a large forest with several combine building in it which house resupplies for ammo and health/energy. beyond the forest is an endless wasteland with no way to quickly cross it.
 
Both opponents start with full health and suit energy as well as full ammo and all of their weapons. New Gordon can use all of old Gordon's weapons perfectly though old Gordon would be using new Gordon's weapons for the first time.

It's a fight to the death and their both determined to win it. So only one question remains.


***Who, Would, Win.*** 




 #pcegemingmasssterrracre lolololololollolol 




 Must be possessed. 




 Well many of the rituals and meditations have over-all improved my day to day life, Now that I meditate everyday I feel much better than before I did. Not only that but many of the spells are accurate and have worked for me. Not only that but I have also grown as a person because it challenged me to think beyond what I knew before. 




 Honestly as a member for almost a year now, I share your sentiment as do many other in the community. But by simply looking past the hateful shite on there you can find some useful information on there. Remember, don't follow anything blindly and think with your brain instead of your gut. 














 Such as the main character using judo in fights or judo being a central theme. 




 It took me wayyyy to long to figure this was about canada. 














 Your welcome. 




 [This reminds me of a joke I saw a while ago on SMBC.](http://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/20120930.gif) 









 Sure. Ask me anything you want to know about. 




 This is really **The** most logical conclusion ever thought up. But you forgot about how the reptoids assisted them with assassinating JFK 




 Yeah, petroleum or oil is the decayed remains of ancient megafauna/flora (giant animals/plant) So the moon having oil means there would have to have been life at one point which is (spoilers) Huge. 




 Spiritual satanist here. I'll elaborate on the chakra's in simple(ish) terms. If I leave anything out that you'd like to know feel free to PM me with more questions.

First. Imagine your body has energy flowing through it. Like water the energy goes from the top to the bottom following the path of least resistance. The path of least resistance in the human body is along the spine, you can see this purely medically in that the spine is where all the impulse travel going to the various muscles in the body's.

Chakra's a simply places where the energy bunches up and forms large pools of energy. Each chakra is attached to a humans emotional state in some way, the flow of energy affecting how you feel emotionally.

As the energy goes down it follows a path similar to a rainbow. with high energy violet rays where the energy starts and lower frequency after it has been diluted somewhat. This is why the chakra's are portrayed as (from top to bottom) violet, blue, cyan, green, yellow, orange, red.

[Here is a chart which displays how the chakra's are laid out as well as what emotion their commonly associated with](http://www.colourharmonie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/7-chakras-in-the-body-symbols-and-meaning-1024x810-meditationgongs.net_.jpg)

If the chakra's get a blockage in them it can seriously mess up the flow of energy in the body. the lower chakra's being starved and the higher chakra's being bloated with energy. This is why so many spiritual satanist's practice yoga, so as to clear up blockages and balance the energy in the body as well as increase overall power.

Now let's go into what each of the seven chakra's does.

First let's start with the lowest chakra. The root or the [Muladhara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muladhara) chakra. It governs all animal aspect of the body. Eating, drinking, sleeping ETC. It is also the most violent chakra and the one with the lowest vibration. It is also the chakra linked with fire.

Now onto the 2nd Chakra. The sacral chakra or [Swadhisthana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadhisthana) this rules the animal urge of sex. Not many focus on empowering this chakra but this is probably the least developed for most people simply because of how society looks upon sex. And how many people associate sex with regret.

Now the third chakra, the solar plexus chakra or the [Manipura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipura). This chakra is dominated by the son and is the one closest to satan. It also helps rule intuition and psychic energies. It is associated with fire.

Now the fourth chakra, the heart chakra or the [Anahata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anahata). This chakra is associated with all emotions but especially love. this and the sixth chakra are greatly over used in the new age culture, such that many new agers are imbalanced with this being bombarded by energy and focusing less on other chakra's. (remember balance is key)

Now onto the fifth chakra, the throat chakra. Or the [Vishuddha.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishuddha) This chakra rules expression. having an active throat chakra generally means your good at singing, painting, writing and other creative arts.

Now the sixth chakra, the Third eye chakra or the [Ajna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajna). This chakra is probably the one you've heard the most about as many just spam it with energy trying to develop psychic abilities very quickly. This chakra rules foresight and intuition as well as telepathy and telekinesis.

And finally, the seventh chakra. The crown chakra or, the [Sahasrara.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahasrara) This chakra rules your spiritual side and is your connection to the universe at large, as well as satan and the other gods. someone with a large amount of power in this chakra is usually very religious and connected to the earth and other around them.

Sorry if I left anything out but I had to condense over what would normally be 100,000 of letter's into a more manageable size (sorry if there's any spelling/grammar errors)but there's a LOT of stuff I left out. I encourage you to research this stuff yourself and form your own opinions of what lies before you on the path ahead.

Thanks for reading through this incredibly long winded post (my longest one yet)



TL;DR: Chakra's are energy points on the body and each one does different thing's 




 Fuck. sorry, autocorrect is evil. 









 Thanks for explaining this. 




 Can someone explain to me what mouse acceleration is? I've noticed it on some games but I've never enabled it. 




 Two rounds. both of which see the combine opening a portal in a relatively flat area and having one hour of prep time before the avengers get there.

Round 1:The avengers team from the first movie VS a (somewhat) small amount of combine forces. let's say, 10,000 or so. the combine are equipped the pulse rifles, mounted machine guns with kinetic barriers in front, SMG's, Shotguns, and grenades. (no gunships though.)

Round 2: The entire avengers team with all current and past members from every piece of avengers media (the comics, the movies and if there is any other media I'm not thinking of) VS A larger force of combine soldiers of about 50,000 normal combine soldiers with the gear listed above and about 10,000 elite combine, gunships, dropships, turrets and those tank/truck thing's. 




 "Now your gonna die!!" 




 NCR. everyone else is just sitting on their asses barely surviving (Bar the enclave and BoS (most BoS chapters except the eastern one are jerks)) Not only that but factions like the followers or the leigon wouldn't even exist if not for them. And so far they're the only government consisting of more than one town that's democratic. 




 /r/PublicFreakout  




 Actually. JoS has it's own forums. It uses one of those shitty free formats. the mods are draconian in nature and very off putting of ANY conflicting ideals. But it is a relatively good place for a member of the community to get a question answered. (PM me if you want the link) 




 I can't be the only member of the JoS community who wants to start a sub. 
























 It never hurts too look. And maybe they left some subtle hints. 




 /u/weaslelord found something interesting over on /r/gaming. Here's a direct quote from his post.

Looks like for whatever reason the Dota site has a countdown built in to it. This is what the URL that the TF2 site is hitting: http://www.dota2.com/jsfeed/timeuntilpdt?time=17%20Jun%202014%2017:00:00[1] (at which point they then do stuff to update the countdown and such). No Team Defense of the Fortress 2 unfortunately. Not this time, anyway.

What he's saying is that the timer isn't contained on the TF2 site but is rather directed through the DOTA website. this indicates that this timer **MIGHT** (and stress the might) have something to do with DOTA as well as TF2.  




 No one knows. it could be HL3. it could be bread*.

*Most likely bread. 




 Nobody knoooowssss ooooooo. Seriously though I'm gonna try and dig into this things source and see if I can find any further info.

 Perhaps by the pound. 




 Freedom. To me satan means freedom. freedom of expression, freedom of choice and freedom of god. Christianity and other religions might boast freedom but the only freedom they truly offer is freedom to comform. Satanism however offers true freedom and freedom is all i could ever want. 




 Imagine this happening to a man getting a vasectomy. But seriously dude. I'm so sorry that that happened to you and I hope you sued.  




 This is a great piece. reminds me a lot of the centaurs from fallout.

 Ask any questions you have about satanism and one of the mods will respond with an answer promptly.

 Electricity for example was considered a very Satanic thing when it was first discovered and utilized.

 Okay, I'm not really aware of what the limitations are because I only have some base knowledge in HTML/CSS and python.

But wouldn't you only  have to change syntax's? 




 It must be a sign.... Hmm. seduce... I know! You must be able to seduce alyx in HL3! 




 It'd be nice to see this. But why only lua? you could release the game with only lua and start releasing additional packs. Wanna learn python? New DLC just came out!, Wanna learn C++? New DLC just came out!

You could release the game and afterwards make language packs which just change the programming language used to manipulate the world. 




 I cringed when I heard ooo-bisoft 




 Thank you. We try and work hard to make everything here high quality and respectful. 









 okay, let me re-phrase that. "This is quite possibly the most neutral karma count gilded comment I've ever seen."  




 This is quite possibly the most neutral karma count gilded comment I've ever seen.

 Has nobody thought of bender yet? I mean, he waited for 1000 years and was disappointed when someone brought him 'round. 




 No discussions between characters, in a plain white room, no need for food, water or sleep and they don't age, no forms of stimuli whatsoever outside of their own minds. Which one could wait the longest before giving up. 




 I recently found out that there are strikes in judo. Does anybody have any resources as to where I can learn strikes in judo? are there any dojo's near washington D.C that anyone knows of that teach's strikes? 




 Alright, can we just end the discussion here? It's obvious we'll keep going over why sacrifice is or isn't wrong ad infinitum.

The only reason the sidebar said what it said was to give an example. It wasn't saying Satanism *couldn't be about these things* but rather that hollywood often sensationalize's the activity's of your everyday satanist.

We could go on and on for years about how the sidebar is worded and whether or not it's dictating what satanism is or isn't about.

So let's just stop here and say we're both wrong in some respects and right in some respects. 




 thank you. this was very informative. 




 Changed the sidebar again. I'm starting to feel i've lost my integrity at this point.

As for the sacrifice. Why would satan want an animal dead? If he demanded sacrifices then he would be just as corrupt and evil as any other god. not only that but what could sacrificing say a goat possibly do for him? It'd serve no purpose and the goat would have died for no reason. not even to be eaten.

If you're an atheist and you sacrifice a goat then it's the same thing. All your doing is appeasing yourself and in the process you take a goats life. Hence, something I don't do myself but if you really feel like you have to go ahead. 




 If there's no sea then you can't base it off sea level. Is it from the core? 




 I took your advice and changed the bit on the sidebar (I didn't actually write the sidebar, /u/bb411114 did btw)

As for the bit about sacrifice, the reason I don't agree with sacrfice is because killing the animal serves no actual purpose. If you slaughter an animal to eat it at least you have a reason to kill it. Same thing with coats.

Now for sacrificing it to satan lets look at it in 2 ways. First let's start with the theistic ideology: Why would satan want you to kill an animal for him? There's nothing the animal dying actually does for him, also Satan is kind and caring. The animals are just as much his followers as you or I are. so why would he wish for them to die?

As for atheistic sacrificing. If you don't even believe in a higher power what's the point of killing an animal? to appease yourself?  if you're doing it simply to make yourself feel better then you might have seriously rethink some of your life decisions.

As for drinking blood. If both parties consent to it and agree that they wish to drink each other's blood then I see nothing wrong. 
























 i'd recommend just meditating. Don't try and do anything advanced just sit in a comfortable spot, if you have it the put on some calming soft music at a relatively low volume. Sit down in your comfortable spot, it should be somewhere where you can relax and no one will bother you, though if you can then try and have atleast some sunlight coming down on you.

After you find somewhere that works, sit down, with your music on and sit in whatever position is most comfortable. I sit in the classic cross-legged "buddhist" position but it really doesn't matter so long as you're comfortable, you can relax, and your spine's straight. Speaking of which, when you sit down. Make sure to keep your spine straight, this is very important and should never be neglected.

After you sit down in a comfortable position close your eyes and begin breathing slowly. Inhale for two seconds through the nostril, hold the air in for two seconds, exhale for two second, and keep the air out for 2 second. Repeat this cycle while clearing your mind of stray thoughts. The way I do this is by recognizing a thought in my brain and simply easing it away, once your mind is clear begin relaxing your body, continue breathing deeply and straighten your spine while concentrating on a body part and visualizing it slowly dissipating into nothingness. start out by doing this to your fingers and then your arms, feet, legs etc until your entire body is relaxed.

Now that you're relaxed simply continue to breath and keep your mind clear of stray thoughts. If you had any objectives then you should do them now. Keep your mind clear, your spine straight, and your breathing stable for about 15 minutes. After a decent amount of time has passed while you're relaxed slowly begin to move your body parts, wiggle a toe or a finger and slowly bring yourself out of the meditative state.

After the meditation I'm usually a little sore from sitting for so long so just get up and walk around a bit, eat some food and have something to drink.

Don't worry if you can't do all this on your first try. It took me several weeks of meditation to be able to do it regularly. Once you can do this easily and quickly (5 minutes or less to get to meditative state) then you should be able to do most other rituals.

 And humans are.... Not bald apes? 




 Wat 




 ^teehee 




 I'm in a similar situation, I've beaten the game 10 or so times now, I've gone good legion, bad legion, good NCR, bad NCR, Good house, Bad House, all 3 independents, I've played through all DLC 15 or so times. I've reached lvl 50 3 times and my first save has every unique weapon and all the gold from the sierra madre as well as all locations visited.

It took me about 100 hours to do that one save file and I have about 600 hours altogether in NV but the ending...

I mean, they could've just released a DLC to continue it like they did with 3. I think the reason they didn't do it was because it was too ambitious. They'd have to make hundreds of different version of the mojave because even doing something slightly different changes the ending. To measure up they'd have to make sure your decisions are reflected everywhere. That'd take way to much time and way to much money for one $15 DLC to make it worthwhile. 




 Fallout: New Vegas. The game was amazing and definitely ranks up there in my top 10 games of all time. Probably my top 5 even, but when I finally beat Lanius and general Oliver congratulated me I expected something... More, it just plays the epilogue and you have to go back to a save from before the battle at hoover dam. This was exactly what people didn't like about Fallout 3 and I understand they didn't have a post game because of time-restraints but....

I wish they had atleast had a DLC which continued it. The ending was okay, but in comparison to the rest of the game it just left me feeling empty and wanting more.

 That is super easy, omegle sends your IP through video and that can be traced to a city. I've done it myself a few times, super funny for trolling. They get so freaked.

All you need is wireshark and the ability to know how to use it.

Edit: [Here's a video about how to do it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMgAZuh5FPg) 




 This made my fucking day. 




 Oh. So the government should be allowed to run up massive amount of debt and pay none of it back while I would A: get my knees broken. Or B: Have to declare bankruptcy? for doing the same?

Seems legit. 




 Learning how to make a stable budget is important. In fact, it's so important that the government has to do it! 

...Oh wait... 




 They're scaled down in that a martial artist can't just punch a hole through the universe, (a la kame sennin ryu) The fighters can use all the super duper techniques they want but can only apply as much force and speed as an Olympic level human. The guy you're talking about, (no idea who he is BTW) could use his aikido but he would only be able to do it as quickly as a normal human being, he couldn't jump 50 feet in the air he could jump 5, He couldn't punch through a concrete wall but he could punch through an interior wall.

If a certain ability couldn't be used by someone who lacks the superhuman strength of that character then the character simply can't use it. 




 Every real martial art including all major styles fights along with all fictional martial arts. All martial arts gets the greatest ever practitioner of the art to represent them, if a martial art has it's practitioner be stronger than a normal human athlete (IE: Kenshiro or Goku), they will be scaled down to only be able to do what a olympic athlete human can do. Ki blasts are allowed but they can't be any stronger than a punch and take twice the effort of throwing that punch physically.

If a martial art involves the use of weapons as a requirement (Like kendo or fencing) they will be given a standard quality version of the weapon made of either metal or wood, however, martial arts which have weapons as optional (Like aikido) are not given weapons and are only allowed to use their fists.

No rules are enforced so hits to the groin and gouging of the eyes are perfectly fine.

The arena is a large, flat stadium with more than enough room for all competitors.

Round 1: All real martial arts in a team VS all fictional martial arts in a team.

Round 2: Free for all, all martial arts against each other, alliances can be formed but only one can stand at the end.

Round 3: free for all in which fictional martial arts are no longer allowed to use any form of ki/energy attacks.

Round 4: All competitors are given SMG's, Automatic shotguns, and chainsaws, which art lasts the longest. 




 Kenshiro, he dies in the first episode from bleeding after Shin cuts his arms and legs.

Alternatively, Toki dies when he gets his legs get smashed from the boulder after he fell down the cliff with raoh. 




 Man, you need to check your facts. He was way taller, i heard he was like, twelve stories high. 




 Actually, I'll one up you and say the doctor **does** exist. Just not in this universe.

If you go off multiverse theory then every possible eventuality has happened, is happening, and will happen. So, the doctor has to exist hundreds of trillions of times, but in all likelihood he just doesn't exist in this universe. 




 Leave any questions you have about satanism or Satan below and one of the mods will answer promptly. 




 I myself am in a very similar situation to yours. I too live in a christian household and I'm thus, unable to perform any rituals beyond meditation before bed. What I'd recommend is thus. If you want to contact your guardian demon, either find a time when your family is gone and perform a summoning ritual then. Or try and astral project. By astral projection you could seek the guidance of a guardian demon. However, what I would most strongly recommend is to simply wait. You've already made admiral progress simply by recognizing these truths and by partaking in power meditations, no one expects you to do anything more. Simply keep meditating and wait until you're old enough to move out of your families house. 




 And the sky will begin raining money as pigs fly by. 




 This is the only real answer. 




 Yes! I haven't finished it but I got it for free a while back. I honestly prefer it to fallout 1 (though not fallout 2) as though it isn't as deep it is a lot more fun. I really like the multi-person squad and with more people and faster paced gameplay it can really fun at some points. 




 Well, Not saying I agree with them. but airplane tickets cost so much that you should get bigger seats then what they give you. 




 [NOTHING AT ALL.](http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/15/1599e06bd7b11b9d1e3d414c4cfb97bd3ad4ed044ac06d4ec5625cf4d0d224ec.jpg) 




 I don't think I eat that much in a fortnight. 




 I too enjoy human beans. They are delicious. 




 only to the main question. not to comments on the question. 




 Being a magician/warlock just means you use ritual to somehow gain power. Aesthetically being a magician/warlock just means you somehow internalize your power through ritual and end up becoming a stronger person IE: you become more motivated, you begin working out more. stuff like that. (I can't elaborate very well on the subject as I myself am a theistic satanist)

Theistically being a warlock/magician is invoking satan and his demons to help you in a task IE: Attracting money towards you through ritual. Or you use meditation to program your own aura to do something IE: make people more attracted to you. Personally I prefer the later option as it empowers you more and gives you more control.

If you have any more questions PM me with them. [Here's a list of spells that I often use in meditation but they are by no means the only spell. experiment and find what works for you. But remember affirmation is probably the best way to program your aura](http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Satanic_Magick.html)

 It's Dolomite baby! 




 Finally! support for my browser! 




 der funny's 




 about 8:00 PM me thinks. 




 I'm hoping D.C think of all the satire they could make about politics. And one of the player characters could be a politician even. the missions could be about gaining power in the political system and it could talk about how effed up the US government is. Just an idea though. 




 I think it should happen at 5:00 PM for you. of course thats assuming my brain can do maths. 




 Nope. just found image links and HTML/CSS nothing of any note. I guess we'll just have to see what happens. 




 Made ninja edit there. 




 What timezone you in? I can tell you when it will end in your timezone if I know it. 




 [It's a reference to a small thing in TF2. It's a joke how every time someone says there's gonna be a huge update you retort with bread.](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Bread) 




 Although it's unlikely I think that we could very well be seeing some sort of OB2 scenario going on here. Think of all the hints going on. L4D2 being free on christmas like portal 1 was before portal 2 was released, The alleged leaked screens of source 2.0, End of the line sounds like a final update to me. and now this? I'm probably wrong but I think that this right now might be the single most likely time that valve could release a new game.

And that game just might be.... ricochet 2 ^or.. ^you ^know ^~~HL3~~ ^a ^DoD ^sequel... 




 I don't know about you guys.... but my body's ready.

Ninja edit.
