 Massaged my anus and came the build up felt a bit good but the ejaculation was like a annoying irritating feeling, i felt dizzy and felt like vomiting afterwards, light headed and felt sick. I am circumcised, does this have to do with anything? I have dried up glands as do all circumcised guys and it's the dorsal slit method so manual restoration is not an option

 Is pleasure affected? 




 My day will basically consist of important things cold turkey and deep contemplative thought 




 What do you guys think? 














 dopamine receptor and neuroplasticity conversation

You: i tried to develop a strategy

You: neurons are strengthened better if pleasure pain or emotions are 
involved


You: right?

You: so what i figured was, what if i stop all the stimulation

You: and let myself get bored

You: no tv shows

You: no junk food

You: no slouching sitting up straight

You: no procrastinating focusing

You: and i stuck to it

You: it ended badly

You: i got depressed

You: anxious

You: but when i did stimulate myself

You: via "fun"

You: i felt better

You: but i feel like having too much fun is bad

You: as it can be a distraction

You: and can make one dependent on "fun"

You: it can make them addicted as well

You: which will be harder to quit

i guess some sort of balance is the key? your thoughts? 




 After fully understanding nietzsche i have discovered just how flawed the society around me and myself are. I found all my delusions, rationalisations, false interests, escapism all of it and it does feel terrible but I am willing to improve myself bit by bit. When exposing the overwhelming amount of flaws my mind kept on switching between giving up with a sense of nihilism (it's all going to end anyway so just live life and let it go) to the will to life and the will to power (Life happens once, be completely honest in every moment) the eternal recurrence started spawning ideas in my head, If I were to repeat this life with the lack of meaning and delusions for eternity how unfulfilling would it be? Though if there were times when I stood up and acted against delusions and become brave and powerful, then a repeating life may be worth it just for the moments of greatness. Where to begin though? When my mind is solving a problem I just ask myself, is this the most important thing I could be thinking about right now? am I spending my days truly improving my life or am I just wasting it because of escapism and more delusions? Is the question "Am i doing/thinking the most important thing in my life?" a question worth asking, is it an important question? what if it is a result of a delusion? There are so many variables that my whole life is making me feel lost and powerless but the will to life still remains

 "I should wait until I am on day 10 to apply for jobs, to see my friends, to go out, to work on projects, because on day 10 i am in super power mode"

Days pass then i relapse and feel guilty, the cycle continues, how can I get out of this mode of thinking, I even remind myself of what day I am on rather than using the counter as a way to measure progress I rely on it, help 




 My friend Shin Dong-hyuk escaped from a north korean concentration camp and from our conversations and all of our interactions I can tell how profound his situation was, it's beyond imagination.

 "Addiction is somewhat like peer pressureit hovers around, urging you to do something, but the decision to take action is yours. When people say that they cant give up an addiction, it usually means that deep down they dont want to or dont believe that its possible." PHD study
Nothing is true everything is permitted carpe diem etc 









 I figured neuroscience is the most important thing i can learn about right now, what's the most efficient way of learning neuroscience, wikipedia? youtube? 




 why, it was a massive load though 




 can you elaborate on how you did this? 




 *Also, I started doing things that make me feel uncomfortable or scare and intimidate me. It really expanded....my mind, I guess.

can you elaborate on this part? 









 What are major things that have improved your life and are worth putting time into?

I was thinking of learning more about neuroscience and reading nietzsche 




 That's a justification? 




 18 starting zoloft for depression, anxiety and attention issues
edit: heard people can have permanent brain chemical issues
development issues
high amount of weight gains 




 exactly 




 what's the point though? isn't life itself worth the experience, no matter how much pain and suffering, the will to life, what justification would you have not to live your life 




 what's the point? it seems like an excuse for any weaknesses, a way to avoid the will to live 




 I like the cycle of dissapointment, self improvement, challenges and learning but have you ever had times or are you planning to have times when they will be the most joyful, where you are madly in love or doing something that makes you fall in love with life itself, like these two seem to be experiencing things on a whole new level http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2W0-z8EnaM 




 what's the point of that? The will to life makes much more sense 




 Love, experiences, learning, challenges, self improvement.

I am trying to find something to do with my life, maybe get a job maybe try to find love what is a worthy challenge 



















 Not this time, we are strong 




 (Y) 




 We all know it, one day we will die and then we won't exist forever.


Right now as your eyes read the words I am typing, you exist and if you are honest enough with yourself, the journey to self improvement is the best journey.

**This right here is an opportunity to walk through the desert to see how successful you are at survival in the desert. To test your spirit against the ultimate challenge: owning one's self. How long until your spirit breaks? Probably not long but instil the idea of death properly in your mind, non existence forever is the most powerful source of energy to make the hard decisions in the present moment. Stay powerful and be cautious of emotions, self pity and other forms of weakness. Finally the most important way to travel in this journey is to "pour the water on the ground" as someone else on this forum once said. The water is tempting to drink in the desert but once you realise beyond the self doubt that you are powerful enough to pour the water and continue walking through the desert then you will be on your way to sure success. When you arrive in a situation where you are tempted to just fap or just watch one more video or any types of distractions, you should identify that they are glasses of water that you should pour on the ground and keep fighting in the desert.**

Love is something that human's hold very close to each other 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dDRijXGUNc
there is life after love as the saying goes, if you have come this far maybe you are willing to take a few more steps 














 I disagree strongly and it's obvious why. 




 Yes, because seeing things in context, the "big picture", is one of the most difficult intellectual challenges. Most lifeforms can't do it. It is our human gift to be able to juxtapose in the mind things that aren't juxtaposed in our environment. Especially intangible things like your own death. Imagining death as a thing and then placing that thing next to other things in the mind is hard work. Keep practicing.

That feeling where something you have been trying to do is placed into words and you finally feel that the meaning of such a task has been increased because someone else commented it 




 while you are alive you have to be brutally honest with yourself

 do that 




 finished highschool 




 i alternate per day i lift weights then on the even day and on the odd day I run until i'll out of breath takes 5-10 minutes 









 I feel like I lose my super powers after all types of ejaculation though, even with a partner. 




 bump 




 The few days after a relapse, I feel absolutely terrible and i'm not sure why.

Either it's because I have "lost" super powers.

Because I feel guilty or because my belief in no fap is so strong that it's actually having a placebo on me

Brain chemicals or hormones

someone please help, or knock some perspective into me 














 private message me and we can be no fap accountability buddies in a group chat 




 I'm usually intellectpassion and emotion but... LET'S DO THIS SHIT 




 exactly, rather than saying yes to nofap you are saying yes to life 









 can you elaborate on the difficulty though, how long and how many attempts 




 Testing out a recent study, type of you are cut or uncut, and how your progress with this has been going/longest streaks etc. 




 your link isn't working, what do you mean by "elaborated" in this context 




 that's what i said 




 bump 




 circumcised guys are more prone to relapsing,
uncircumcised guys can last long streaks of 90 days+ etc
is it true? tell me if you are cut or uncut and how your streaks have been going
there are theories on this that I will explain after I get the replies 




 don't get it 




 The last part reminded me of something in my childhood, i can't quite tell what it is, make me wonder if I have memories that are "blocked" out or if I am living a life that denies one aspect as if I am in denial then again it could be that i'm imagining things, makes you wonder... 




 Yes, my family hid 25 grand in a small room instalment behind the house, I was contemplating faking a break in and taking the money.
Someone give me some perspective or advice?
Not sure how insurance works but insurance companies might not believe they hid money there. 









 In my case i think i am very sexual and when the drive comes back i just can't let go. i PMOD, 

1. felt bored and was getting image like flashes of a girl from my school

2. Started to imagine her in the room getting naked wanted to have sex

3. imagined some of the ex

4. instead of studying i disabled my filters my google chrome extensions so i could google stuff about sex stories, i felt very curious to read about what sex feels like in detail

5. felt the urge to watch a girl getting satisfied vaginally it was like OCD something is seriously wrong here

6. watched porn videos of girls getting satisfied vaginally from the front (this satisfied that ocd like urge)

7. erection with a lot of precum, felt like orgasming but i had a strong urge to also stop it all and go to sleep

8. *you've already come this far close to orgasm + porn might as well orgasm*
that statement always leads me to failure, i don't know if there is some truth to it

9. came

URGENT HELP BROZ 




 How many times did you relapse, i've relapsed around a dozen times 




 though what if a consciously focus on what i am doing to the point where i don't notice the noise, idk this situation is very confusing for me, there is time pressure as well and i feel so scared and lost, all these opinions from others "only a day until your exam!" "wow that noise is really bad how can you study" idk whether to believe or what so lost omg fuck 




  If you have music from your neighbors that is fairly loud, would you suggest staying where the noise is and studying so that I can get used to studying with noise, or moving all my stuff which is a hastle

 




 that's irrelevant to my question, it's a matter of me getting used to noise or if nose is not something you can get used to for intense concentration like exams and studying 




 If you have music from your neighbors that is fairly loud, would you suggest staying where the noise is and studying so that I can get used to studying with noise, or moving all my stuff which is a hastle

 smacked? docked? 




 I would also like to add to the example of a forest with an overall improvement in enjoyment and quality of life/happiness/satisfaction
also the nofap forum would be an example of those abstaining from (pmo) porn masturbation and orgasm which includes other forms of stimulation 









 It's hard to measure if one is truly happy though, I can go ahead and believe that I am in the best state I can possibly be but every day there is some frustration to an extent mixed in with despair and it seems to part of an individual's progress. 




 @takei what's happening 




 a fulfilling relationship
or fulfilling aspects in their lives, elaborate on these  points 









 wtf is this shit feel achy, anxious, sick in my stomach, hopeless, depressed, apathetic

throughout these 8 days i have held on to my D, provoked some erections for the feeling of horniness, and sexual fantasy has been on my mind non stop 









 have you realised that you could zoom out and see life for every second as very valuable as this is the only existence you could get, you could be spending your time doing what is really the most important, the neurons that lead you to choose something more comfortable can be replaced by neurons that want you to make the most out of life, every second is the most valuable you will ever receive in all of existence 
























 this^ 




 yes because you get out of the habit of thinking useless thoughts 




 My attempt is to try low stimulation activities, these include staring at a wall and doing nothing, walking while doing nothing or reading a book like nietzsche, our lives are full of overly stimulating activities like music, movies, games, porn the idea is to challenge the brain to live with normal to low stimulation, the brain should get "hungry" for stimulation and also your creative side will wake up even more. The mechanics for one activity goes:

Walk

 thought enters head

time is precious, is this thought even worth thinking about, this thought is probably a rationalization or weakness is it?

 next thought comes in "an urge to play a game", is there a good reason to play that game? no

 another thought "is this worth precious human seconds?" probably not

eventually the boredom will fuel the brain for neuroplasticity and creativity for self improvement

thoughts guys?

 An idea nietzsche put out there that clears this up. Many complex systems such as addiction as well as life can not be summed up into steps or rules we need to think for ourselves and deal with our problems as each situation is unique. This is why he despised the stoics while they said "just be perseverant" you can't sum up life to that one statement but I agree with everything else.

 I relapsed yesterday i promised myself i would make it 90 days but it's like I became brainwashed it was day 5 and honestly in that moment I wanted to relapse the urge was so strong I wasn't myself anymore. Fucking hell :(

how?!!? 









 5 days 




 help 









 you guessed it i unzipped the bean bag  put my D inside and zipped it up so no 
beans will fall out and did my thing :( I feel like giving up on life damn

i honestly thought i would make it 90 days this time wtf *** my mind went animal crazy when thinking about the bean bag it was like it was sacred and no one thought about that method of fapping 




 When this question appears in your head what caused you 
"not to think of that"

neurologically
biologically
or evolutionarily 




 What causes me to feel like that and how can i prevent it

 EXACTLY
 




 Whenever i feel horny i get the urge to fap and my thoughts go straight to fapping instead of thoughts about sex and having sex how can i rewire my brain 









 I have been somewhat successful with no fap but as I used to fap before i go to sleep now when it's time to go to sleep non stop horny thoughts wash over my mind i feel all tingly and excited and it's like i'm brainwashed because it's a strong habit WTF do i do 




 Is it useful or harmful I sometimes sit there and say to myself "time is valuable, make sure you are thinking important thoughts"? so i sit in silence and then for every thought that comes into my mind i label it like i mentioned above reminding me of my precious seconds

I watched a porn video yesterday that was a porn vid that I saw a few years ago when i was 13 and it was saved on a hard drive, I had a very strong OCD type urge today to find her and then re watch the vid so that "the penis can pound the hole hard" was what the obsessive compulsion it wasn't even a sexual desire but an obassessive compulsive one much like some earlier OCD symptoms in my childhood, , also "so that maximum pleasure can be reached for her" I also wanted to know a lot about her like her age and height,

 very strange :( I am failing badly and my life is falling apart

You're now chatting with a random stranger. Say hi!

You both like philosophy.

You: Hello.

Stranger: hi

Stranger: ive noticed people with this philosophy tag type "hello" instead of hi

Stranger: and put a period after it

Stranger: aswell

You: Read Nietzsche?

Stranger: yes i know some

You: Such as?

Stranger: the will to power

You: Yeah i'm interested in ubermench

You: I wake up i try to improve my life, i still scratch my hair and skin, i still pop my joints, i still can't read a 

book and focus, i still get scared and anxious and confused, i still, fap and watch porn, i still eat junk, i still 

distract myself rather than think difficult thoughts, i am trying to re-wire these things but it looks like the 

downward spiral isn't changing course thus making it even harder to quit in the future neuroscience :(

Stranger: ok.

You: any thoughts?

Stranger: what does it mean to "improve your life"

Stranger: ?

You: move beyond your illusion

Stranger: theres your ego

You: self overcome

Stranger: you asked for my thoughts

You: well honestly are you pulling some zen buddism now?

Stranger: no

Stranger: i asked a simple question

Stranger: i dont see the relation

You: my answer is the paragraph above

Stranger: are you telling me you can not respond logically to a challenge?

You: you can deduce what it means to improve

Stranger: no i wont

Stranger: because you cant

Stranger: i have no interest

Stranger: because you are now below me

Stranger: and you have proven it

You: how so...

You: now you are being an elitist

Stranger: you want to express your bullshit delusional ideas but cant defend them with a logic structure

Stranger: no im not an elitist

Stranger: im sorry your ego is hurt

Stranger: it wasnt a complex question that went off on a tangent

Stranger: it was rather simple and challenged the base.

Stranger: the base should be strong

You: Self improvement is have control over one's self

Stranger: no it isnt

Stranger: that is your subjective interpretation of it

You: Training yourself to have conscious control when second nature insists otherwise

Stranger: so you are implying there is duality

You: No

Stranger: how can you not be in "conscious control"

Stranger: how could you know consciousness beyond your human consciousness

You: Just conflicting actions with desires

Stranger: are you implying that actions arent a product of desires/

Stranger: that duality exists between them

You: No

You: ...

Stranger: so then back it up

Stranger: use logic.

You: I'm using reasoning

You: and critical thinking

Stranger: no you arent.

Stranger: you arent challenging my points

You: Your points are not pertinent

Stranger: they are absolutely related

Stranger: everything ive been saying is a response to you

You: hmm

You: I did respond though

Stranger: i didnt say you didnt

You: I don't need to back up my "no"

Stranger: but you are by saying you dont need to back it up

Stranger: fool

Stranger: basic logic failure

Stranger: again.

Stranger: and again.

Stranger: my points remain uncontested

Stranger: you go off on more tangents now

You: No, you made claims without backing them up.

You: The burden of proof is on you.

Stranger: as in where

Stranger: bring it up

Stranger: where i did

Stranger: burden of proof is on me

Stranger: thats a baseless claim in itself

Stranger: rather than being your opinion

Stranger: but yea where did i make a claim without backing it up

You: You want your points contested.

You: Show me a point.

Stranger: we are having a discussion

Stranger: so you want to switch the topic now..

You: They are questions. In which I replied No.

Stranger: no you went off on a tangent

Stranger: i asked you to back up claims

Stranger: your base was "no"

Stranger: should i leave then?

Stranger: since you cant hold a conversation

You: What claim should I back up

You: You asked me if I was implying anything

You: and I said NO

Stranger: i did more than ask questions

Stranger: i think i added statements as well

Stranger: let me scroll

Stranger: "Self improvement is have control over one's self"

Stranger: that doesnt comply with the linear logic structure of language

Stranger: so back it up

Stranger: x=y

Stranger: is what you said

You: To achieve self improvement self control over one's self is a necessary skill.

Stranger: you just changed the point you made

You: i did

Stranger: so you couldnt back it up

Stranger: i assume

You: Not the first one

You: I re stated it

Stranger: sure i will challenge this one too

Stranger: saying something is "necessary" isnt true outside of your personal truths. "necessity" is an abstract 
subjective idea

You: Sure

You: It is of high importance subjectively

You: Saying that it is not is nihilism.

Stranger: "importance" is also a subjective abstract idea

Stranger: what?

Stranger: nihilism is a paradox...

Stranger: saying life is pointless is a point in itself

Stranger: as where believing life is meaningless is a given meaning in itself

Stranger: correct?

You: No

You: "as where believing life is meaningless is a given meaning in itself"

You: how is that a given meaning in itself?

Stranger: because it follows logic. "saying life is pointless is a point in itself"

Stranger: see the irony?

Stranger: meaning is an abstract subjective idea aswell. by saying it is meaningless

Stranger: you still use meaning

You: There is a regress there. Life is meaningless -- Created meaning --- Meaning that was created becomes 
meaningless. Followed by a halt in changing states as the threshold is exceeded.

Stranger: it is a paradox

Stranger: and meaning that was created becomes meaningless is meaning

Stranger: and it goes on and on

You: Intuitively ergo Life is meaningless.

Stranger: it doesnt mean it isnt it just means it also is meaning

Stranger: its

Stranger: a

Stranger: paradox

You: how old are you?

Stranger: why do you ask the question at this point in the conversation

Stranger: i hope this wont turn to an ad hominem

Stranger: but i mean you are going off on a tangent

You: Being overly analytical can be seen as a form of escapism, using what valuable time you have to escape 
solving real life solutions.

You: You limit your intuition to logic.

Stranger: believing that anyone can be "overly analytical" is a belief in itself

Stranger: so is everything you said

Stranger: there is a loophole in logic

Stranger: and so i challenge language

Stranger: but you hold absolutes with logic

Stranger: believing there is something to escape from is abelief aswell

You: Intuitively you seem trapped here. What's the reason for challenging the fabric here?

Stranger: i would say this pattern is more confrontational

Stranger: I seem trapped, yet you are the one going off on tangents and my last related point was uncontested 
again

You: so?

Stranger: you dont reach a dead end with this logic structure

Stranger: rather a circle

Stranger: that continues

Stranger: so you can argue forever

Stranger: and that is more confrontational than escapist

You: Living lifeoverly analytical

Stranger: i dont even agree with what i type but you dont have the intellect to point out my contradiction of self
You: As a function of time

Stranger: going off on a tangent again

Stranger: more ad hominems

You: How is it an AH?

Stranger: you just stated an opinion again while i maintaing objectivity in the logic structure of language

Stranger: because it is an opinion by logics standards

Stranger: and you are using that logic structure to communicate

You: ...

Stranger: we can take it more slowly for you.

Stranger: saying "living life is better than being overly analytical"

Stranger: is that an opinion?

Stranger: are the reasons for that belief based on opinions?

Stranger: is it subjective?

Stranger: answer those

Stranger: yes or no questions

You: It's based on intuition that is not limited by the constraints you keep on building.

Stranger: you are implying that i understand what you are trying to say

Stranger: thats an assumption in itself

Stranger: a belief.

Stranger: right?

You: Objectively and evolutionarily the individual is programmed to survive and reproduce, self improvement is 
intuitively superior to over analysis which is escapism in nature.

Stranger: no. that itself is a belief

Stranger: you are holding things to be absolute

Stranger: can you not see that what you are saying is subjective?

You: Your beliefs that beliefs are to be negated is an assumption in itself

Stranger: who said they are to be negated

You: now you are being paradoxical

You: you refute "beliefs"

Stranger: no

You: you haven't backed up why those are "absolutes"


Stranger: i just point out they are beliefs

Stranger: i just said there arent absolutes

Stranger: ..

You: "you are holding things to be absolute"

Stranger: o

Stranger: why do you hold them to be absolute

Stranger: was the question

Stranger: ok

You: I don't what makes you think I do?

Stranger: because by making a statement, you hold it to be definitive by its nature

Stranger: by the logic structure that you participate in called language

Stranger: every statement is a paradox

Stranger: even saying every statement is a paradox is a paradox

Stranger: meaning, if i say nothing is absolute. i am holding "nothing is absolute" as absolute

Stranger: so it doesnt reach a dead end with this logic structure

Stranger: it just loops

You: ok

You: What is the over arching concept here

Stranger: ok

Stranger: how could i communicate it with language.

Stranger: after what i just said

You: Intuition

Stranger: intuition is a product of this logic

You: How?

Stranger: because it is an idea that can be formulated into words

Stranger: its paradoxical

You: how is it a posteriori?

Stranger: im going to use an idea that can be formulated into words to express an idea that cant be formulated 

into words

Stranger: thats what i cant do

Stranger: but i can

Stranger: because i just said it

Stranger: thats why its paradoxical

Stranger: agree? disagree?

Stranger: "thoughts"

You: indifeference

You: indifference

Stranger: if you were indifferent then you wouldnt need to say you were indifferent

Stranger: see how it loops?

You: I'm indifferent about your statement I care about stating it though.

Stranger: right



Stranger: so you arent indifferent

You: I'm indifferent about your statement I care about stating it 

though.



Stranger: after all that you still cant use the intellect



You: What?



Stranger: you defending what you initially said is just as paradoxical



Stranger: and you cant see that


Stranger: or dont want too

Stranger: w/e

You: You are the one that can't use intellect.

Stranger has disconnected.
 




 "I, test_subject2183, accept the challenge of being accountable for the next 90 days to this group of Fapstronauts. I will make it the full 90 days without viewing pornographic materials, faping, edging, or having any form of sexual intercourse with my wife. I am committing to this because I love my wife more than anyone in the world, and I MUST change for her! When I prove to myself that I can endure this 90 day struggle, I will have the ability to stand strong for the rest of my life."

neuroscience :( 









 i'm in, should we make it on facebook chat perhaps, like a grop convo there 




 Evolutionarily the teenage years are when hormones spike and psychological activity alters, this encourages organisms to leave the family and go out to seek mates, with the internet and pmo we have overstimulated this trait to the point of dulling pleasure receptors the key is to focus on self improvement and avoid pmo 




 Longest streak is 8 days 




 Develop a cycle when you get energy from being horny, use that energy to do things that help you with no fap and thus get more energy. 




 If we cut back from such pleasures, less pleasure chemicals related to such tasks would be involved, less chemicals means more receptors which means improved quality of life? 




 What happens after long term withdrawal of superstimuli?

http://www.highexistence.com/supernatural-stimuli-comic 




 If we suddenly cut back on all superstimuli, over time what kind of people will we become? Will we be better in general?
e.g. I am choosing to read a book over watching a tv show, reading a book will help strengthen my attention span, and isn't overloaded with sounds, visuals and fast paced action, so it's more calm and contemplative 









 I relapsed 20 times in the span of a few months with a longest streak of 8 days without orgasming 




 tight makes it harder as well because i feel like my penis is restricted, if it goes to full size like 8 inches it feels like it's being held back possibly affecting angle and growth 




 I want some practical advice here
 




 help
 




 Constant stimulation as the glans rub against clothes makes it impossible with relapse after relapse, about 20 relapses when trying no fap over months of trying it's just impossible to be successful at no pmo and fantasy

fucks sake 




 doesn't tag nsfw
not a signle fuck was given 




 yeah man, after many relapses i learned that being successful at no fap isn't the goal but rather self improvement, it's an overall challenge to make your life better 




 bump 




 When i say "amazing" many would just read the word but the type of "amazing" i am talking about is beyond anything you can imagine right now [AMAZING](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1pb5n3/why_i_do_no_fap/) 




 Help, I was alone and i had a fantasy of a friend that is a girl do some foreplay and soem fucking and i am feeling really horny and my imagination feels real if i try hard enough, i held onto my penis and moved the skin around it wasn't really masturbating, i came close to orgasm though and i felt tempted to orgasm but i'm wondering should i just orgasm now or should i continut with the streak, and how dangerous is what i did today to rebooting 









 also in a philosophical sense, if everything is beautiful you can't contrast the negative so the beautiful can't exist as there is nothing to manifest it 




 
Exercise.
Save money.
Plan for your future. Invest in it.
Wrap your tool.
Tell everyone how you feel about them because in your future they will all be dead.
Relax.
Be positive. Choose to be happy.
Surround yourself with positive, caring people that are better than you.
Practice forgiveness and understanding.
Set goals and put your entire being towards them, whatever they may be.
Give everything you do in life 100%, regardless of how you feel about it. Success is a choice you make every day; it is not dependent upon results.
You're not always right. Always assume you could be wrong. If you are, forgive yourself and move on. Don't dwell. Be thankful to those who corrected you. Ego and pride are roadblocks, surpass them.
Your entire life is defined more by what you give to others than what you have or receive, whether you want to admit it or not. Every day practice a habit of giving, even if it's something small like a compliment. You always have something to offer others, even if you don't have time or money.
Remember that you, just like everyone else, have the power to change the world profoundly. You matter. You only have one life. Make it count. 




 Comfort over challenge, watching tv, tasty food, escapism etc. 




 When a person transitions from: insecure, fearful, sensitive, critical
to: "alright attack me", adrenaline type energy, wanting to face fear, wanting to feel the pain, careless/carefree, is it a type of nihilism? or is it more of a ubermench eixstential attitude 




 Yeah something about quitting cold turkey after masturbating for years doesn't seem right, maybe one should just gradually cut back 



















 Circumcision via the dorsal slit method when i was younger is making me depressed every time i think about it, also the rubbing of the glans during walking or exercise is irritating and especially during exercise I worry that it's desensitising even more. I also worry that I am missing out on so much like the pleasure of having a frenar band and the foreskin with benefits like smoothness and warmth 
























 can you interpret the situation?

and

I may be a bit out of perspective so ask me questions as well to uncover if I may be deluded or if there is something I can do to solve my problem here? 




 Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster... for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you.....

 WHOA DUDE I "AM" the universe whoa 




 I say it a lot because I have so much on my mind that I forget some things I was thinking about and spend ages trying to remember them. This morning my goal was to wake up at 6:30 it was very important but I got up at 9 because in my head I was saying to myself, I'm trying to remember something it's like my brain has habitually used that as a rationalization tool because it's so uncomfortable getting out of bed,

 are you his doctor 




 Proceeds to lower it towards pants 









 I have a feeling that he was some what elitist, kindness and compassion were not what he was about but i'm not really sure i have to read more and more to really get a better idea 




 please elaborate? 




 My plan is to minimise light and avoid artificial light after sunset, go to bed at 9pm and stay in darkness for 2 hours then fall asleep at 11pm and wake up at 6:30am thus when I get up it's not during a sleep cycle. In the morning I will expose myself to sunlight and throughout the day I will try and get a lot of sunlight while avoiding artificial light.  









 help 









 very intelligent, aced primary school anxiety started at puberty and it's severe, ruined highschool grades got below average so damn disappointed with what happened everything else is going shitty, grades, friends, relationships tried meds, counselling, doctors, sleep schedules, natural lighting, better eating, improvement and improvement of exercise ah fucking hell 




 Before going to sleep i literally feel on the edge if i touch my penis it might cum.

So how can i avoid a wet dream because i feel like orgasms make my super powers go away.
Maybe something along the lines of

1. realize you are in a sexual dream


2. stop and focus on something else


3. try and wake up and focus on something else 




  It was super gross, and he would always do this creepy giggle when he did it.

damn i read that as jingle

now that's fucked up haha 




 He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you.
"Beyond Good and Evil", Aphorism 146 (1886) Nietzsche

 




 - after research realise it's best to sleep on back or side

- wake up with sore throat, dry bitter disgusting taste, sick feeling in stomach and feeling shitty every morning discouraging me to drink water in the morning

- told it's because you sleep on your back which opens your mouth and encourages snoring

what do? 




 wait i mean dekeritanize - whatever it means to make it less cracked and dry and more smooth, glossy and normal shaped 




 i wear it while asleep, what is the solution? my goal is to keritanize the glans and restore sensitivity to the frenulum, i'll PM you links to my situation since it was a dorsal slit and those are slightly different

  Buddhism is just another form of escapism

I've been reading a lot of nietzsche and nietzsche seems to be focused on the life affirming, endure through suffering type lifestyle while buddhism seems like an unconvincing idea of escapism, quick fixes, harmony or bliss.

Some would argue and say that buddhism is about wisdom and a peace mind, a peace mind will lead to better coping with life but i doubt that a peace mind is exclusive to buddhism i think learning to live with life as it is much like how nietzsche describes will leave you better off in the long run. 




 He seems to be focused on escaping reality and living in some type of artificial bliss. I would say an opposite perspective would be that of Nietzsche, a life affirming idea where people acknowledge the reality they life in no matter how unpleasant and try to live with it, try to adapt to it and overcome it, rather than escaping with your meditation, your lsd or ecstacy or even your quick fixes like instant bliss. One should get up off their ass take life by the fucking neck and be the master and not the slave. 




 That one comes across my mind every now and then and gets me awake for about 20 minutes then it's back to a miserable existence.

another one that makes me feel great and powerful

"I have no pity for them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth anything or not - that one endures." -nietzsche 




  I don't think they could have invaded the west coast. Midway would not have been the first big battle, Hawaii would have. From there it would have gone on much as it did, but at a later date. Lets say everything was delayed by a year, that we had not reduced them as much to ruins by the time the atomic bomb came into play. We had Tinian a year before we dropped the bomb- they would have been dropped on Japan on the same day as it already happened, and the war would have soon ended.
It may be that this would have drawn more of our resources from the European theater, in which case the Soviets would have ended up with more of Europe at the end. They could have beat Germany by themselves, assuming that lend-lease went on the same in the new history. 









 Help instead of a full erection, penis head opens i used to get hard ons that were very strong and my penis would be 8 inches long now instead of a full erection the penis head opens as if something is holding everything back and i only get 6 inches long help!

You: ok if you have a boner and you feel horny a few things you can do to help yourself have self control

You: make sure you are not hungry tired moody or thirsty

You: so hydrate yourself

You: use muscles a bit so that the blood goes from your penis elsewhere

You: a horny flaccid penis doesn't do much

You: and finally will power, consciously one can control everything they do, they just rationalize actions and some of them become automatic, so focus and try and control yourself, a burning monk during a protest didn't move a muscle or make a sound that's how much self control he had

You: so just remember your prefrontal cortex makes the decisions

You: the limbic system gives suggestions

You: you got anything to add to that plan?

You: how do you deal with those situations

You: rather than waiting it out specifically how do you take conscious control?

You: in detail

Stranger: well usually when I get erect I try to focus on other things or preoccupy myself, or if I start stroking my penis I'll force myself to put my hands at my sides. Also sometimes if I'm very horny and can't help it I'll play with my testicles, but not orgasm.

You: i try to re-wire my neurons, so if I am horny I would intuitively tell myself find a girl then

You: so eventually if you get really horny you will be good with women because you are so hungry for it

You: so every time you get horny ask, "how can I plan things so that I can increase my chances of finding women?

You: and if you happen to be around them and you are not feeling horny then you can say to yourself again intuitively -you had a chance-



You: the body will eventually re-wire itself to the real stuff

You: that goes for fetishes as well treat fetishes as you would treat horny urges

Stranger: good idea!

Stranger: it's just tough because I have a big cock too

 Hows edging, fantasy, online pics or vids going for you? 




 Guys I am broadcasting this from inside the moon, 

**QUICK ASK ME ALL YOUR QUESTIONS BEFORE THEY FIND OUT I AM A TRAITOR** 




   If you hold back orgasms the cum will just return to your bladder and will leave anyways when you pee.

whoa wait, can you back that up with a source?
 




 Interesting observation that only orgasm makes me lose super powers

edging doesn't

sex does

handjobs or blowjobs from a girl does  




 Conveys the idea of man leaving behind supernatural concepts and other forms of delusion and escapism for a rational assertive judgement. 




 Why didn't you do the *pretend is half asleep and pulls up pants unconsciously and moves slightly away and covers himself*

you didn't mention that option you rationalizing denial animal you  lol... 




 They are the only two options 

and how does it make you feel, the ability to have sex forever is it a turn on?

So the rule goes

Have sex

Ejaculate with orgasm

Loop

(You don't get used to it or it doesn't get boring because time is repeated so the brain doesn't numb, so basically it's the best sexual experience that could ever exist going on forever) 









 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlW739d3J4o 




 I was a bit worried that i might develop some bad thinking habits with this though or i might rewire it to think unnaturally with the natural flow of thoughts being undermined 




 My attempt is to try low stimulation activities, these include staring at a wall and doing nothing, walking while doing nothing or reading a book like nietzsche, our lives are full of overly stimulating activities like music, movies, games, porn the idea is to challenge the brain to live with normal to low stimulation, the brain should get "hungry" for stimulation and also your creative side will wake up even more. The mechanics for one activity goes:

Walk

thought enters head

time is precious, is this thought even worth thinking about, this thought is probably a rationalization or weakness is it?

next thought comes in "an urge to play a game", is there a good reason to play that game? no

another thought "is this worth precious human seconds?" probably not

eventually the boredom will fuel the brain for neuroplasticity and creativity for self improvement
thoughts guys? 




 alright thanks 




 yeah ok

 This question is profound as it brings things back into perspective, you will be nonexistent forever after this so how much time do you have left to truly live life, to have a great life to the point where you would be glad if it repeated itself,  find some great things to be doing 




 only short term because of sensitivity 




 Every time you get an erection in your underwear, the tight underwear restricts blood flow causing the brain to stop encouraging an erection and do the reverse, make it flaccid again. Over time this becomes habitual to the point where erections are less inclined to happen because they only go about 50% or never reach their peak

 I wake up I try to get somewhere I try to make things better but I really feel like I am going no where, I read nietzsche i try to get a better understanding of life but wow that perpetual non existence after we die makes me want to do something now but it looks like i can't 




 My throat hurts every morning and I feel a sick feeling when i drink water  in the first 5 seconds but it does help in the long term 









 yeah nietzsche was brilliant, care to elaborate? 




 He was playing twisted metal 2 














 day 8  and i have 0 libido i feel asexual this is my 30th attempt at no fap and my first time getting to 8 days (i've tried for months) day 2 i was horny but all the other days of this reboot i have had 0 libido wtf should i be horny on day 7 and 8 because of testosterone? 




 Yeah sort of like, 

- ok here i am doing nothing
- organisms adapt to their environment
- so if i stay here and do nothing and it feels painfully boring it means i am adapting to what is natural

overstimulation comes with a host of other problems as well 
























  Except that none of those are requirements except in that you want them.
 You can starve to death, dehydrate, or freeze. You choose not to, because those things suck. But that does not make it anything less than a choice both in that moment and in the aggregate.
 You don't have to have a job, you want one because the alternatives suck. You don't have to take this particular job, or keep it even when you dislike it, your alternatives just suck.
 But trying to morph the fact that you don't like your choices into something meaning "I don't have a choice" is bullshit. You always have a choice.

Looking at the big picture we are slaves to those more powerful than us, to those who are providing our needs in exchange for money which we have to work for. These governments and private corperations have taken the power to produce they have taken the resources they have grown to become huge and take up all the space and by "space" I mean power distribution, the lower you are in the socio economic spectrum the more enslaved you are because to get your needs you need to be a slave to those above you. To sum it up, the governments and ruling class have taken the power and the resources and will give you some in exchange for your own enslavement. Sure you can make your own home and grow your own food  (Although very difficult) but keep in mind that they have the power and are in control, they c

Think of this analogy, organism blue is in a room with resources, organism blue takes the resources and hides them, organism blue learns to mass produce resources and keeps them all too himself, Organism blue has an offspring and dies. The offspring now inherits his resources and power to create. Organism orange is introduced to the room, organism blue proposes to orange that he will give him resources to live and also the hope of maybe one day inheriting this power and great amount of resources in exchange for orange helping blue mass produce and grow more powerful so it's orange's survival and a bit of liberty for his time effort, keep in mind "survival". Now compare this to slavery, a slave is told "help us or we'll leave you to die here in the desert." My alternative is a society where everyone contributes, and there doesn't have to be a ruling class or if there is at least not corrupt and not in all control, this way we can all contribute and we can still make scientific breakthroughs, space exploration, etc it seems much better to the current state of capitalism.

Addressing specifically what you said: you can say the same thing to a slave and try to convince him he is free, try it, say it in your head to one of those african slaves in the US in the 1800's he can starve to death, but he chooses not to because the masters give him the tiny liberty of choosing not to, he doesn't want to be a slave but his alternatives suck as well, therefore we have some choice but it doesn't change the fact that capitalism is slavery like I originally stated you are stating anything that can change my view in a valid way.

The key: If a slave is given some choice it does not necessarily mean that he is not a slave

 I've been getting urinary tract infection like symptoms

- pain when urinating quickly (I suspect it's from old dried up semen)
the first drop causes a sharp pain inside the penis, if i urinate quickly it hurts more and will sting for a long time, if I go slowly it only hurts a little

- after urination I will have a burning sensation and after ejaculation i would have a very dry drained feeling inside the penis area, maybe inside the tube it feels very uncomfortable,

- after urination I will feel like I still need to pee, and drops of urine will come out one by one slowly for up to 10 minutes or even more sometimes even 45 minutes

- streams would sometimes be bulky and go all over the place, like a spray or double stream I would also have slow streams a lot

i'm 18 years old and a male from australia, seen several doctors which done urine and blood tests, nothing showed up, saw a urologist even got an ultrasound of internal organs.

Hope superpowers won't go away
 




 I was feeling a bit horny and needed to replace the saran wrap on my glans (restoring sensitivity for circumcised guys) when i felt a little "pop". A drop of liquid went out of my penis and i felt a mini orgasm. I started to get warm and for the next 30 seconds my heart started beating fast, my breathing got faster and it felt like i was having a mini orgasm for 20 seconds. Followed by a built up in release, i then orgasmed and ejaculated. Fucking hell 31 day streak i feel like crying and crawling up into a hole. I had plans and this was the perfect moment of my life to be successful at nofap. I know it doesn't count as a reset but personally i think i lose "super powers" after an orgasm

I can't describe what emotions I am feeling now but damn my life is truly a disappointing one

 what is it to be "great"and why does it matter so much? nietzsche's whole idea is to be great and to actualize one's potential

 Mostly paleo, cutting back on carbohydrates big time, focusing on calorie restriction and eating less in general




-
[Much like this](http://documentaryheaven.com/eat-fast-and-live-longer/)


-
exercise is moderate cardio (3 days a week) with a lot of walking and standing (standing desk) very little sitting

-

some moderate weight exercises 3 days a week

coffee and red wine occasionally
hopefully moderate socializing
walking in  nature 

**My big concern is the reduction of carbohydrates, calories and eating in general**


*Can someone give me some ideas and theories as to what are the pros and cons and hopefully speak in neuroscientific and biological ways?* 




 specifically neurologically and biologically 









 Also worrying about other things like idea theft and patents

How can one actually get around to working on the idea? Is there a way to just sell my idea? 




 I'm not even close to a relapse 

did you read this?

I'm not about to relapse, i'm just saying that I wish I had the teenage boy like urge to go after women
btw
i've been covering my junk with saran wrap to restore sensitivity in the glans because of circumcision, you think blocking of the meatus could make someone unintentionally successful at nofap because it is blocking the path of least resistance, the person wouldn't have to overcome and grow over their urges either so that might be bad?

 feel the same day 31 and i am not feeling amazing 




 If having sex with a girl was heaven and fapping was average then I would be motivated, help i'm confused and lost 




 In the past when I made it to day 10 I felt what everyone described, the superpowers, the energy, the feeling of being awake and alive.


Reached 31 days today and don't feel different at all. I think I found the problem. I have made myself completely asexual. My mind seems to believe that I have gone asexual rather than quitting masturbation or porn, today when I thought about fapping an intuition came from my mind like fapping is a "Disease" I maybe accidentally oppressed myself or it could possibly be some sort of flat line. from day 7-31 it has been effortless I didn't really have to try.


 I'm not really leaving the option of sexual activities with women open to myself because I feel like some or whatever superpowers I have will go away if I ejaculate or orgasm.


 I don't know what I am doing wrong, my past streaks that used to make it to 10 days each on average would make life a 10/10 but this streak of 31 has taken my life from the usual 3/10 to a 3.2/10 




 *You look extra pretty today* 




 O-O I don't see what's wrong with that statement? 




 1. Set up a huge goal that will help your life in the long run.
2. Go for the goal and try your best to achieve it, rationaliaztions, distrations and denial will appear and sway you off the track at times, analyse them and try and overcome them, discover your weaknesses and try and get stronger.
3. ???
4. PROFIT
