 I wrote a paper on zebra stripes for my intro evolution course last year.  It was difficult to find studies on zebra stripes because everyone has just gone with the explanation someone came up with in ~~1890~~ 1867.

EDIT: Looked up the date - it was 1867, not 1890. 




 I'm an undergrad and do research in an ecology lab on my university's campus.  In my ecology courses, I learned about Optimal Foraging Theory (OFT) and even did some small experiments in those courses pertaining to OFT.  In my lab the other day, some of the professors were talking during our weekly lab meeting about behavior and one said that ecologists haven't used OFT to explain behavior in decades, ehoch surprised me since most of my courses devote so much time on the topic.  The professors in my lab are always busy and are out of the lab half the time, so I figured I'd ask other ecologically inclined people here!

Are there major flaws that make OFT a bad explanation for behavior?  




 Here are a [couple](http://www.care2.com/causes/wind-farms-and-eagle-deaths-the-dilemmas-of-green-energy.html) of [articles](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-impact-wind-farms-get-pass-eagle-deaths) about what /u/DonnieS1 is talking about.

I know that wind farms kill far fewer birds than other forms of energy production, but they should be held accountable if they commit the same federal offenses as the other guys.  If they aren't made to pay the fines though, I'd like to see wind farms that kill birds put money towards conservation of affected bird species (if they don't already do that). 




 I just got a friend request about 20 minutes ago from someone I didn't know, but whose name I had seen before but couldn't remember where. When I read your comment,  it dawned on me, and sure enough, this person's name appeared on my phone's caller ID when he tried to call me last week (I don't answer for names I don't recognize). That's really unnerving... 




 Taylor Swift's reaction looks eerily similar to [this](http://i.imgur.com/NMNqH.gif). 




 These headphones definitely make the vast majority of the songs I listen to sound glorious, but I've never listened to any other headphones so I can't say whether or not they're the best out there.  I would recommend them based on my experience and general stinginess though, at least until (or if) I come across another kind that I think sound better and are in the same price range. 




 I got myself the Audio Technica ATH-M50 a few months ago for about $100.  This is my first non-earbud listening apparatus and I'd definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a decent pair of headphones at a fair price, especially since I've spent $150 for Bose earbuds before.

 Dr. Ingrid Visser has [permission](http://www.orcaresearch.org/index.php/marine-mammals-regulations) to participate in these interactions according to the website of the research trust she [founded] (http://www.orcaresearch.org/index.php/research/our-team).  She's written an [autobiography] (http://www.amazon.com/Ingrid-N.-Visser/e/B003BWZFFO) and there's a BBC [documentary] (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0147dw3) about her research style, if you're interested!  Also, here's a BBC [interview] (https://soundcloud.com/orca-research-trust/bbc-swimming-with-whales) about what it is like to swim with killer whales, the New Zealand population of killer whales in general, and Dr. Visser's feelings concerning cetacean captivity. 




 Mmmhmm. 




 Last year, as I was walking down a campus street in the afternoon, a middle-aged couple approached me.  The man began to tell me this story about how his lady has been in the university hospital, so they needed money because their car was parked in the hospital garage and was also out of gas and they haven't eaten all day and needed food.  The lady even showed me a "hospital ID bracelet" she was wearing to prove she had just left the hospital.  I knew this story was BS, because they were in the academic core of the university which is about 10 blocks from the hospital and they both looked homeless.  I told them I was a broke college student, but they wouldn't take that for an answer.  The man kept adding to his story and was getting closer to me and the woman started to move to my side and was heading behind me.  Since there were 2 of them and 1 of me and the street was unusually deserted at the time, I gave them the change in my pocket and they immediately left.  I figured it was better to give them ~$1 in change and get out of there than to stay and potentially get robbed.

 What was it? 




 Are there any particularly fun/unique experiences you've had with your dog? 









 There was speculation among anti-captivity circles that this application had much greater implications for the import of wild-caught cetaceans to the U.S.  Had it been approved, some believed that it could open the door for the capture of Alaskan killer whales that ventured into Russian waters, which would be of great interest to SeaWorld in particular, as the genetic variation within their captive population is deplorably low. 









 Are these rubber-tipped sticks?  If they're not and the guy has decent chops he could probably do some damage to the treadmill. 




 Here are the links to the papers on [blue whales](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1765/20130657) and [beaked whales](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/9/4/20130223), respectively, sited by the article.

I'm surprised the authors of the beaked whale paper were able to get published with a sample size of two individuals, but since beaked whales are so rare, it was probably not feasible to use a larger sample size. 









 Congrats on the long term relationship! 

I've never met anyone from Ohio that is happy to be from here.  Either they already left and are glad they did or are planning to leave after whatever life milestone comes next (graduation, retirement, etc.).  The only problem is that it's like a miniature black hole of terrible that's nearly impossible to escape from. 




 I'm surprised Ohio hasn't shown up yet.  Do non-Ohioans not hate our state as much as we do?

We don't even have a real flag, we use bodies of water as directions (north is called "towards the lake" and south is called "towards the river"), and our unit for measuring time is "days until the next Ohio State University football game."  Oh yeah, and soybeans.  Soybeans.  Everywhere. 




 I was an idiot today and was playing with a power strip with a wet hand while the other was in an aquarium and I was standing in a pool of water.  I felt a buzz in my finger when I turned on the strip that I hadn't felt before when using it and realized I'd just been shocked.  That freaked me out because I could have potentially died and not even realized it. 




 I wrote the previous comment at work and guessed on the date.  In his 1867 book *Mimicry, and Other Protective Resemblances Among Animals* (and later, his 1879 paper published in *Science*), Alfred Russel Wallace suggested stripes evolved in order to provide camouflage from predators by allowing zebras to blend in with the surrounding area.
This particular hypothesis was refuted by Darwin and others since the stripes do not blend with the usual zebra habitat of short grasses, but the more recent adaptation is that the stripes confuse predators by making it difficult to single out an individual in the group.  However, zebras tend to live in small groups or are solitary, so this might not even be the case.

Some other hypotheses are that the stripes are for social benefits (sexual selection or communication), thermoregulation, and protection from parasites (tsetse flies in particular).  Darwin thought it might be for intrasexual selection and described an experiment in which a female zebra and a male wild ass are placed together and the female zebra would only let the wild ass mate with her when the researchers painted stripes him.

Personally, I think zebra stripes are least likely to be for predator avoidance, but that seems to be the one that has stuck in society's list of animal myths. 
























 It could definitely (and probably does) cause auditory hearing loss because their ears work very much like ours.  The sonar mechanism is a little more tricky.  I'm on mobile now and like I said earlier, I'm feeling particularly tired/lazy so I'm going to try to explain what I can remember about it (which isn't much).  Small cetaceans have an organ on the top of their head called a melon.  I can't recall what's in it, but it's either fluid-filled or fatty and it's highly malleable.  They use it to alter the high frequency sound waves they emit, which bounce off objects in the water.  They receive the returning waves through ~~hollows~~ special sound conducting tissues in their lower jaw, ~~which is either gas-filled or fluid-filled~~, and this amplifies it for them.  ~~I'm not sure off the top of my head if the sonar waves go from the jaw to the ears or if they have another avenue to the brain, but I'll definitely look it up when I get a chance in the next day or so.~~  The sound waves then travel to the inner ear.

So the loud music probably wouldn't damage the melon or jawbone to produce and receive the sonar, but it could affect the inner ear, which is used for auditory hearing as well ~~I'm not sure about the sonar processing pathway.  If it's the ears then it would, but I have a feeling it's not~~.  Echolocation seems to not be as important as auditory hearing though, which I was surprised to learn.  It seems even less important for captive cetaceans, since their environment never changes and is pretty free of obstacles. They probably learn quickly how to avoid running into the walls or bottom at night if it's too dark too see and don't need to use sonar much after that.

EDIT: [NOAA link](http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/cetaceans/cetaceaechol.php) that has good info! 




 Unfortunately, there's been a recent fad of having EDM concerts (or firework shows) at zoos and aquaria.  It's really bad for marine mammals in particular, because of their physiology and the construction of the pools that they are kept in.  Small cetaceans, such as dolphins, in particular have extremely sensitive hearing, so much so that they can even hunt fish solely through auditory sound, as opposed to using sight or echolocation (referenced in [this paper](http://www.econscience.org/val/pubs/orca_refs/barrett-lennard+96.pdf)).  The concrete tanks that cetaceans are kept in also act like giant satellite dishes, amplifying and reverberating any sound waves that enter the tanks (best link I could find is a [heavily anti-captivity blog](http://www.freewebs.com/let_toki_go_free/dolphinswim.htm), but this seems like common sense that bare walls cause echoes).  Also, sounds are naturally amplified by water ([Yahoo answers is the best source I can find quickly](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100517162204AAyO0TC), but again, it's common sense that the more dense a fluid, the more concentrated by sound).  Combine all these facts, and you have a terrible situation to be in if you're a cetacean.  It's also awful when you have people feed them things that they shouldn't eat.  Allegedly, captive dolphins are quick to eat just about anything, which could be a stereotypical behavior caused by the lack of stimulus in a captive environment or because they are kept hungry in order to get them to interact with zoo patrons.  I've read stories about people feeding captive dolphins paper, coins, and even lit cigarettes.  This is why I dislike people.

EDIT1: I can try to find links to supporting data later if anyone is interested.  It'd be more about the first half of what I said than the last half (since it's not like zoos and aquaria will let outside researchers study their animals to for the negative impacts captivity has on them).  Although I could find links for the second half, it would all be anecdotal.  It's late at night so I'm far to tired/lazy to do it now.

EDIT2: Links added.  Bonus [link](http://cetaceaninspiration.tumblr.com/post/33537138326/cetacean-hearing-music-in-shows-does-not-hurt) of a good Tumblr debate on the issue of noises affecting captive cetaceans.

TL;DR: Marine mammal captivity sucks. 









 After a hiatus and eventual retooling, Search the City is back and releasing a new album in about 3 weeks.  Much different sound than the previous line up (new singer, drummer, and bassist) but still great! 









 Yeah, if I had to get mauled by a mystery beast, I'd prefer to be completely covered at the time.  




 I think I would stop midstream if that happened to me.  Do you know if it ever tried to attack anyone? 




 Your sister does a great thing!  I'm glad that you and your sister have been able to help him so much.  I've only ever had small pets like fish and mice, but I'm readying a book on the study of animal personalities and it's made me think about many other animals, and mammals in particular, have sets of behaviors that can be as complex and unique as humans.  Those stories you shared were very heartwarming :) 




 I've seen dogs like him before but I don't know what the breed is called.  He's a great looking dog, though! 




 I've heard stories about camel spiders and such, but some unknown beast lurking around sounds much worse! 




 Awh :(  Hopefully the little guy headed back home after he saw you weren't able to give him any more attention! 




 That's really cool, actually!  Dogs seem to respond to high-stress situations much better than people do 
























 My opinion of SeaWorld has changed from one of admiration to one of severe displeasure over the past decade.  That being said, I also understand that as a business, their goal isn't conservation or education; it's to be successful (i.e., make money).  I would just greatly prefer if their business model would change to one that doesn't rely on such abnormal habitat and social conditions for the animals.  Although, as someone who studies animals and not business, I have no idea if that's feasible. 




 You're right.  That chart was made by a person that was actually arguing for captivity, so I was under the impression the person know what he/she was talking about.  [Here](http://24.media.tumblr.com/b3f555b5e519089e3b6992f5718d704e/tumblr_mhq38iFRXn1rmadmwo1_500.jpg) is a chart made by a person arguing against captivity (the first one I posted was supposed to be a rebuttal to this one).  Hopefully this one makes more sense. 




 I wish I had saved the pie chart I saw a couple months ago breaking down how much SeaWorld spends on conservation efforts compared to other things.  I can't remember the figures exactly, but it was an extremely small percentage compared to their profits.  And they often use "rescue" as a reason to get wild animals for their collection.  The park in San Diego often takes sea lions that get trapped in fishing gear, try to train them, keep the ones that are easy to work with and release these half trained, human acclimated animals back into the ocean to get caught in fishing gear again.

And their idea of education is telling people either complete lies (such as that orcas live longer in captivity) or really simple ecological principles (the use of countershading by a ton of different animals).

So they conserve and educate just enough to have their PR team make them sound like the Savior of our oceans.

EDIT: http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/5664/graphtk.jpg

I found the chart I was talking about!  You can't even see the conservation piece (between the green and red pieces).

From the source:
Roughly 0.065% of SeaWorlds annual revenue funds an entire years worth of conservation. To put that in perspective: Target gives 5% of their annual revenue to charity. That is 80 x more money than SeaWorld gives to conservation in the same amount of time.

 NMFS gets petitions like this on a routine basis, almost always from organizations that would profit directly from the delisting of a certain population.  I personally would support the delisting of any group (population or species) that does not need to be listed (i.e., shows an ability to adapt to new human-induced pressure and is at a self-sustaining population size), but I believe most cetaceans are a permanent fixture on the ESL for many reasons (including their slow growth rates, large habitat size, high trophic level, etc.).  Commenting on petitions such as these is definitely important, but I believe that even if the scientific data says the North Pacific population is discrete and thriving, the benefits of keeping them on the ELS would outweigh any possible benefit to the petitioning group. 




 This happened to me a couple weeks ago with a pack of Nature's Path Organic Knockoff Poptarts.  Now I'm lamenting the karma that could have been. :'(

 You're welcome!  I saw Blackfish the first day it came out in my city.  It was a pretty mild look into the life of Tilly, but I enjoyed it overall.  It's a great introduction into the darker side  of captivity.  I'd heard about or seen nearly everything in the movie before then since I've been interested in the topic for about as long as the director has and I think she covers a good amount of information in the 90 minutes she has to present it.  The only inaccuracy (possibly a lie, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt) is when the whale researcher says a wild whale has "never harmed a human."  In fact, there is one documented attack on a human (a surfer in California) in the 1970s that required [100 stitches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_whale_attacks_on_humans).  He survived, but I would consider that harming a human and I believe the researcher should have known about that attack.

The book [Death at SeaWorld by David Kirby](http://deathatseaworld.com/) paints a much more in depth portrait into Tilly's psyche.  The Cove is another good documentary into the captivity industry involving smaller cetaceans (mostly bottlenose dolphins).

SeaWorld is extremely good at PR and has been since the very beginning, so I don't think OP is a bad person for his or her viewpoint.  I understand your use of the word "brainwashed" in the context, but I try to believe that people who are fans of SeaWorld have put in the effort to weigh the pros and cons and just came to a different conclusion than I have.  Many of the points I stated before about possible benefits are adequate, but also have stronger counterpoints in my opinion.  It's an extremely complex and emotionally-driven issue, since we can't determine how marine mammals think or feel.  We also can't quantify the benefits attained from any suffering experienced by the captive animals.  The past 40 years have definitely opened a scientific window into the world of marine mammal biology, but I would argue animals owned by corporations are no longer useful for any scientific development.  There are labs around the world that study marine mammal physiology using captive animals that live at the labs, but places like SeaWorld seem to only publish/present information on animal husbandry and breeding, which is only beneficial for their interests of keeping animals captive and sustaining a breeding population for multiple generations, with only a marginal percentage of their profits going to conservation and research.

Overall, I personally would argue against keeping marine mammals in captivity and I have a set of reasons that are unquantifiable and definitely driven by emotions, but other people would argue for captivity for another set of reasons that are just as unquantifiable and driven by emotions.  This is a heavy topic, but it's important to try to remember where people on each side are coming from and to realize that strong opinions come from a love and respect for the animals and that everyone wants what they think is best overall. 




 Adventure Club made a mix that contained a mashup of those two songs.  I hadn't heard the Bruno Mars song and only heard the Goyte song a couple times before and thought it was just one song until I looked at the track list. 

Edit: [Link to said mix!](https://soundcloud.com/adventureclubdubstep/superheroes-anonymous-vol-1)  Somebody That I Use To Know comes in around 4:30 and Locked Out of Heaven comes in around 6:50. 




 I'm sort of late to the game on this post, but I'm bored so I searched "SeaWorld" on here to see what showed up.  Hopefully I can help out with your question.  I'll preface my answer my saying I spent a good portion of my childhood and early teens at SeaWorld (last time I went was maybe around '07 or '08), but as I've gotten older I've developed a pretty anticaptivity stance based on the information I've come across, particularly after the death of Dawn the trainer in 2010.  Also, I'm on mobile, so bare with me as I can't look back at either your or OP's comment, so I'll try to remember everything. 

I believe OP is referring to programs such as summer camps, visiting schools, school field trips, internships, etc. when (s)he is talking about education.  I took summer camps there every summer for about a decade, when were definitely fun as a kid, but the actual animal knowledge gained from the experience was probably equivalent to a BBC documentary.  The focus was more on how the workers take care of the animals.  Therefore, I would argue that, at least in my experience with the summer camps, it's more of a recruiting/propaganda tool (Note: I'm not insisting that this is a bad thing, I believe that if the animals are there, the trainers better be the best and brightest available).  Although, the mystique and celebrity status of being a SeaWorld trainer makes the jobs veey competitive, which means the company can give trainers low pay and terrible benefits because they know that for every 1 person that quits, 100 would be willing to take the job.  I guess what I'm saying is that yes, there is an educational aspect, but it's very minimal.  Oh, and the company feeds workers false info to tell patrons regarding the negative aspects of captivity.

Next point is "awareness" I think.  I'm sure that some people are unaware of these animals, but I don't think that SeaWorld is the only avenue for them to learn. In the Internet Age, we can learn a ton about all the animals at SeaWorld.  The only thing SeaWorld provides on this front is a hands-on or close-proximity experience.  These are awesome.  It's amazing to be that close to these mysterious creatures.  The only questions is whether or not you personally think it's worth it for the animals.  I don't, but others do and that's okay.  This is aa complex issue with many opinions. 

Conservation is often times tied in with awareness by procaptivity people, but how many people do you think change their lifestyle just because they went to SeaWorld?  I'd guess not very many.  Plus SeaWorld San Diegovhas gotten in trouble for dumping chemicals into Mission Bay on multiple occasions, so there's that too.

OP brought up rescuing and releasing animals.  The fact of the matter is they use this more as a way to get new animals more than anything.  They find hurt/isolated/nuisance animals, try to acclimate them to captivity, keep the ones that take to it well (even if healthy again), and release the ones that aren't good once those are healthy.  The issue here is the released animals are then used to being around people and are likely to end up in a vulnerable position again.  They don't release high profit animals such as whales, the notable exception being J.J. the juvenile gray whale, but that's because there is no tank large enough to hold an adult.  In fact, SeaWorld wanting nothing to do with the rescue effort at first, but after other groups agreed to foot the bill, they obliged to house it after others caught it.  Only a very small portion of profits go towards rescues, so I look at it as more of a PR move than anything.  Also, you are incorrect about SeaWorld rescuing orcas.  All of SeaWorld's wild orcas were caught by teams of boats and divers.  SeaWorld workers say they were rescued, so I don't blame you for not knowing that.  The only whale that might fall into the rescue category is Morgan, who was an orphan found in the Netherlands in 2011.  An aquarium there took her in and the law there says she had to be released when she was healthy, but they sold her to a park in the Canary Islands instead since that park has other orcas for Morgan to interact with.  After a long legal battle, in which the park presented evidence that Morgan was hard of hearing and couldn't be released, the court said they could keep her, but not profit off her.  Most people would take that to mean no shows.  Morgan still does shows.  Anyways,  before Morgan this Canary Islands park got 3 or 4 whales on a loan from SeaWorld.  I'm not sure about the contract wording, but SeaWorld has now laid claim on Morgan as theirs.  We'll have to see what happens on that front. 

Instead of looking at SeaWorld as a group of cruel people, I try to look at them as a business that uses animals as a commodity.  They try to maximize profits above all else.  It's in their interests to keep animals alive and performing, but happiness is not something they care about.  I understand everything they do from a business standpoint, but I do not think it's moral.

Sorry for the novel, but this is a complex issue and one that I care deeply about.  Hopefully it helps you get a grasp on it.  If you're interested in more info, feel free to pm me and I can try to get more in depth and set you up with links to do your own research.  




 That's very true.  It's highly unlikely that music at these events is loud enough to completely deafen the people or the animals.  However, concert speakers are huge and can register some extremely high dB.  Especially the kind that would be used in a large outdoor area such as a zoo.  Hopefully the speakers would be as far away from the animals as possible, but if not, exposure to loud, sustained noise can cause hearing sensitivity loss just the same as a person standing close to an extremely loud speaker.  These effects are even greater with low frequency bass sounds, which is prevalent in EDM music.  If it's not loud enough to cause any injury, it still has the potential to cause pain or discomfort.  I imagine it gets pretty stressful and annoying to the animals to have these events a couple times a year, even if they don't get injured as a result.
