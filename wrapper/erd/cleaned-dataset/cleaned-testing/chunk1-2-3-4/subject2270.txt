 I live in a Canadian town along the St Lawrence river.  I moved here with my parents when I was in my early twenties (ya, still living at home, pathetic I know) and until I learned to navigate this retirement community with little to no activity for young people, being along the river was pretty much all I thought this town had going for it.  I have spent long hours walking and biking by that river, getting into some very secluded areas.  Im pretty burly for a girl and sharp enough to be able to just talk myself out of most problems, so during the day I feel safe in a lot of different situations.  And maybe I shouldnt.  

At the time of this encounter I was not even in that secluded of a spot.  I was sitting by a stream in a wooded area of a public park.  Nice day, and there was a bit of walking traffic.  A college class from the school nearby even came down to the stream where I was sitting to get some water samples and catch fish, by the looks of their instruments.  The teacher (prof, whatever) seemed increasingly alarmed as he led his class down to the water.  I gave a head nod like hey hows it going, dont worry, just sitting here watching the water.  Still, he hurried his pupils to another spot along the water looking horrified but I just thought whatever.

Hearing a rustle in the bushes right beside me, I became aware of what the prof had seen and why he was horrified.  I also realised the head nod Id given him made it look like I was in on this, but I honestly had been oblivious.  In the bushes next to me was a woman, which was confusing because she was clearly playing with her penis.  Had breasts, was presenting as a woman but was clearly a man.  She looked over at me, then down at her erection, and in my stupor of disbelief she had time to actually point to it, like look!  

As I noped out, I actually said nope! and started climbing up the hill to the path.  He (?) jumped out of the bushes, still playing with himself and trying to get hard in a hurry.  His face was really focused as he came at me and I was really glad it was me in this situation and not some tiny matchstick girl because looks dont scare me and I give as good as I get.  Like, Ive been in scuffles.  This guy was especially puny, but you really never know whos got a knife or blood diseases or just how nuts someone might be, so I was just rathering not and hurried up the hill.  

I guess I could have screamed something at him and in retrospect it really weirds me out how quiet the scene was.  I guess we were both just focused.  As luck would have it, the students and teacher were still close by.  Its funny, I didnt call for help or think to walk up to them for help (which is too bad, because maybe we could have caught the guy), I thought to walk through them to dislodge this creepy predator.  Which I did, and it worked.  I then thought I really should keep looking back as I head to the police station and report because no effing way am I leading this guy to my house if he is following.  Still, my number one priority was getting the hell away.

I reported the flashing, gave a statement and all.  The officer asked if Id seen a backpack around when the guy was in the bushes.  At the time I said no but looking back, there was a ton of rope in a coil and some other things that Im not really sure of.  I guess the makings of a rape kit.  There was a possibility this guy had been following me and knew when Id be by the water, which I find unlikely because my routine is incredibly random and I dont even know when Ill be by the water.  The officer guaranteed me this guy would do something like this again and hopefully theyd get him before he really got serious.  Makes me wish Id tried to beat the shit out of him as an early deterrent.    

So, fledgling rapist, lets not meet again.      
 





























 i don't really know how else to put it, (s)he was a gender bender. 




 me too!  it was a real shock and trying to make sense of what i was seeing took a minute.  i must have done three or four double-takes before it sank in! 
























 in a medicine pouch around my neck every day. 




 My first real job was as a PSW in a nursing home on a native reserve.  PSW for the uninitiated stands for Personal Support Worker, but we in the industry have agreed its more like Professional Shit Wiper.  Im the girl who wipes your grandmas ass, basically.  Of course, I also bathe her, feed her, clothe her, wheel her around and sometimes I even get to talk to her.  Most residents, though, are functionally non-verbal.  Nursing homes provide the service of prolonging a lingering death and over time its easy to look at people with their clawed hands and open, gurgling mouths as not fully human.  The work eventually will erode your soul.
 
Shit wiping aside, the island reserve itself posed some issues.  On the island, most people let their dogs loose maybe for days at a time.  This used to be pretty common elsewhere but its fallen out of favour the last fifty years or so.  And its not hard to see why when these dogs form terrifying packs.  Ill admit Im afraid of dogs.  And there was one around the nursing home who got to me the worst. 

I only ever got a good look at him during the day to see he was a black, ragged thing with one ear almost completely gone, a crooked tail that lay dead and limp behind him and he always seemed to have a new leg to limp on every day.  At night he was much worse.  He was just there in the shadows, scratching at something or another or making chewing, crunching noises eating god knows what.  He wasnt a big one, but the other dogs seemed to give him space.  I could have imagined it, but I always seemed to hear a growling whenever I was out at night taking a smoke break.

I happened to mention this phobia to a resident in conversation.  This man was our golden boy, being pretty much the only resident who was almost zero care.  He could dress, walk, go outside, eat, toilet, and bathe himself: the man had it all.  Oh, I know that dog, hes fine.  But tell you what, Ill bring you a rock from the river next time Im there, he told me that rivers good luck.  A rockd be a good charm. Keep the dogs away.  I mentioned that this resident could bathe himself, but his unfortunate habit was to do so in a nearby river, leaving him smelling worse than if he had not bathed at all.  Id been told to discourage this, but to be honest, I was desperate for a magical rock, even just to throw it at the dog.

We often had staff meetings to discuss making any changes in care plans they are called; basically, the focus was how to change a residents daily routine if they were deteriorating.  Help them into their new, more limited life.  A lot of these meetings were more like gossip than care, plus I was new and low in rank so I didnt have much say in anything which is why I would just zone out.  Okay, lets talk about Roger, my ears perked, Its got to stop, hes getting to a point where he could easily fall and drown in that river.  My thoughts exactly!  We should have stopped this months ago, the smell really is too much.  That water is crawling with all sorts of bacteria and I dont think hes well enough to fight off an infection, god forbid.  There was more talk, but only one verdict: Roger had lost his outdoor privileges.      

I was there the afternoon they broke it to Roger and I can tell you he was devastated.  Heartbroken.  Furious.  Heres your fucking rock. he thrust into my hand a small oval stone when I made my rounds.  Id never heard him swear before.  This was a rare moment where I could forget I had a million butts to wipe and actually connect one-on-one.  His eyes were welling up and he quickly turned them towards the window.  Men at any age dont want to be seen crying.  What gem of wisdom, as a twenty something, could I pass to an elder whod just lost his freedom?  All I could do was take his hand, catch his eye and make him see that I shed a tear of my own.

It was the evening shift, two to ten and, for a change, the director of care would be keeping the same hours.  She was more of a nine-to-five, but she took the occasional late shift.  Mostly I was impressed at Rogers self-control for not wanting her blood since she was the one who took his freedom and he knew it.  If anything, he seemed very focused and calm.  I took this as a sage reaction, like a man coming to terms.  It was a very quiet night, very quiet until Roger started howling.  Great bellows of howling.  Howling, howling, nothing could stop him, we swarmed with all manner of restraints to keep him under some sort of control.  He kept going, until, vary faintly, I was sure I heard a howl from outside almost lost in the commotion.  Roger stopped.  No more struggling, no more howling, he just gave in to the staff.

The director of care left early, hoping, I think, that Roger would be less agitated if she were removed.  She really did have his care at heart.  I was taking a much needed smoke break during a momentary lull in action.  The evening had gone from very quiet to unbelievably busy after Rogers outburst.  It seemed everybody was going to have a restless night.  Goodbye um Carol!  See you tomorrow! the director waved on her way past.  She got my name wrong, but I was new and, to her, pretty much faceless anyway.  She made her way across the parking lot in the dying light when a shadow went wrong.

First one shadow went wrong.  Cast by a tree, a large and tall shadow swiveled from the trees left to its right as though the source of light had completely shifted.  A cars shadow leaked like grease spilling out from under its carriage.  As though jumping ship, the directors own shadow vanished.  She stopped walking.  All the shadows were not only moving towards her, they were forming a patch of darkness in which she had a shrinking spotlight.  As her own shadow returned, the spotlight vanished.  In complete darkness, I could hear her screams and the exact snarling crunching shewing sounds of black dog in the shadows.  I dont remember deciding to make a noise, but a whimper came out.  If a shadow could look at you, thats what the shadow did.  If it could smell you, thats what it did.  If it could decide not to attack you, thats what it did.            

It should have been a relief for the shadows to dissipate, but all it meant was that the horror of the attack came in view.  In a CPR course I had taken, we had discussed when not to start CPR, the idea being you should always start unless it was plainly obvious there was no hope.  There would be no CPR.  In a stupor, I staggered inside only to be greeted by Roger.  Good thing you had the rock, huh?      
























 THANK you.  it's slim pickings out there!  don't want to end up 30,000 dollars in debt for a bachelor of arts.  




 you're absolutely right.  i may not have handled this well in telling my story.
