 Police Constables in Ontario make about 90K a year as a top base salary.

The average Ontario salary is 49K.

He is in fact way off with his 5 times #.

Suspended cops get no extra pay.  Just base salary.
 




 If there's no money in the government coffers, there's no pension.

How could you **not** know that? 




 Do you take any solace knowing his corruption was investigated, Prosecuted and he was fired by his own police forces internal affairs?

They did the right thing, It's the law in Ontario that suspended officers retain their pay. 




 Metal poles are deadly weapons.

 




 Old people are terrified.

Middle aged are scared.

Young people want to party in the Street. 




 Guards were likely paid not to notice. 

It's how things operate in Mexico. 




 Very often when you make a bad loan, you can collect by seizing real property, garnish wages or accept a negotiated new payment plan.

You don't necessarily have to walk away empty handed.  Neither does Germany.

Pay what you owe.  Problem solved. 




 What you call pushing insane terms, I call pushing realistic terms. 




 No love for that genre, but that video was hilarious.   




 You find the results online, it was studied...by this man.  Get a hint of what's in the dust if you read the story.

"Your" dust isn't a rare specimen that likely won't deviate greatly from the mean. 




 I can't even imagine the crazy that /r/conspiracy will come up with. 




 You can still carry concealed.

By your silly argument, every business in Canada is regularly shot up by armed bandits, what with our strict gun control laws and all. 




 You can't just fire all the union members.

You can shut your business down though.

 




 It's not a community garden.

It's a privately owned garden on the city owned easement. 




 Hmm, seems like you could have asked him. 





























 From the story, OPS is the 3rd most understaffed in the entire country.

Those 130 accommodated cops don't help. 




 No.

You must reside in Ontario. 




 From the story;

10% of the OPS is on light duties;

"That senior officer told CFRA there are **130 officers** who cannot do their regular tasks because of things like injury or pregnancy.

"That's 10 per cent of all our sworn staff," the senior officer told CFRA. "That's huge."

I'm told morale is horrible in the OPS, undoubtedly 10% of a force getting out of regular jobs doesn't help. 




 'Outside Canada


We no longer process Canadian Police Certificates for persons living outside of Canada. Please refer to theRCMPfor this service.'

From the Ops website on the background check FAQ

 




 The fact that this even went to trial is a travesty.

The police and the Crown clearly have too much time on their hands.

This man's life is in shambles. 




 Go to the bank in person, see a teller and you'll be able to withdraw some cash. 




 Free speech isn't free if we self censor out of fear of violent reprisal. 




 There are no laws governing abortion in Canada...where I live.

Medical guidelines yes, laws no. 




 People cheering on those who would make Death threats in response to provocative and robust speech should hold their heads in shame.

 




 A fetus alone in the womb will become a baby.

Semen alone will **never** become a baby. 




 Semen needs to fertilize an egg.

Semen can never become a human on its own.

I've honestly never heard someone comparing semen to a fetus before.


I'm pro-choice, but your analogy isn't convincing. 




 I'm prochoice, but the **rare** late term abortions where the baby **would** survive outside the womb, I find quite distressing 

 




 Start.ca

Im perfectly happy with them and I have a VoIP phone with them as well. 




 TIL factual recounting of real events constitutes an attack. 




 Won't make a difference to any claim. 




 I'm happy to see that the police investigated themselves, prosecuted him internally under the PSA, convicted him and then fired him, which was upheld by the OCPC. ( Remember these cases when Canadians claim cops can't investigate themselves)

There **should** be a mechanism in place to suspend officers without pay on a case by case basis.

No such mechanism exists, so dirty and corrupt cops get their top base salary of 90K while they work their way through the system.

So, the government needs to legislate this power, that is currently unavailable to police Chiefs.

The Ontario Association of Chiefs want the ability to suspend with pay on a case by case basis. 
























 If you walk in public, you have no expectation of privacy.

 




 In Canada,( where I live) the courts have ruled there is no expectation of privacy in our yards.

Else your neighbor would get arrested for looking into your backyard.

I don't believe cops jerking off in helicopters is a reasonable concern.

To answer your question, you have zero expectation of privacy on city streets. 




 Probably because she kicked him and then he threw her to the ground, which is self defense.

Was it excessive force?  Possibly.  I believe he could have accomplished a similar end result ( her being on the ground) with less force and her face not hitting the ground.

Assault?  I say no, cause she kicked him and he defended himself. 




 I admit that I'm left a bit taken aback at how positively dreadful some people are online and how they always seem to find each other, so that they can tear people down collectively.

I've been online since 94 and the viciousness has been gradual.

 




 No.

Parents no longer have a parental duty when a child turns 16.

Youth bureau can help, but child services...no. 




 16 is the age you can be kicked out on your own.

 




 You don't suppose there may be an entirely different explanation as to why the 17 year old was booted out? 




 Do you have an expectation of privacy in public?  




 He wasn't sued.

This is criminal court.

 




 It's in the story.

The Fraser Institute. 




 You seem to spend a lot of time on /r/drugs.

I'm a recovering alcoholic and when I was drinking, my main focus was on getting loaded.

Once I got myself clean and sober, I was able to focus my energies on the actual things in my life that mattered and clearly see the big picture.

I also saved a lot of money getting clean, quit smoking too, which also saved me some money.

I wish you well.

 




 I was specifically talking about solicitors.  I'll listen to kids / students or other legitimate members of my neighbourhood.

 




 It has not expired.  You literally just made up your comment about big bad pharma keeping Viagra pricey.

'Pfizer's patent protecting Viagra from generic competition expires in April 2020, but Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. will be allowed to launch its generic version in the United States on Dec. 11, 2017.' 









 Don't ask to see ID.

Just say 'NO thanks' and close the door.  **Never engage door to door solicitors**

My strategy has worked for going on 16 years as a home owner 





























 For arguments sake;

I have a childhood friend, I am 40 now, who I have lost touch with the last 3 or 4 years.

If he died tomorrow, how could I possibly prove that I was friends with him? I do not have a single photograph of him and I together.

 




 You wouldn't believe them anyway.

You know it. 




 I vacation in Florida every year.

Never even met an American police officer.

Worst police state ever. 




 I never experienced it.  Yet Reddit and twitter are bursting at the seems with it. 




 Some kids cause tremendous disruption, conflict and stress in the home, despite having caring parents who have other children who are well behaved.

If they will not respect the rules of the home, set them free.

Some parents are horrible.

Yes, sometimes that is the difficult, but necessary action.

 




 Change the internet?

No.

Call the cunts out for their cunt behavior and stop telling the targets of their collective disdain that it's not a problem?

Yes. 




 Why would you want to block the number? 




 It was absolutely not worse.  Commonly visited websites, unlike commonly visited websites of today, (twitter, Reddit, Facebook,) were not chalk full of poisonous vitriol, anger and insult as they are today.

 




 Human nature has changed, as for the first time in history, there is an easily accessible and anonymous way to heap scorn on others you don't like without any consequence. 




 Did she have the ability not to kick him?



He took her down too hard I think.
I also don't believe she should have kicked him. 




 If I'm 15 and hundreds of people are collectively mocking me, both strangers and my peers and it's spilling over into school...

That shit's gotta hurt something fierce.

I'm 40 and when I was 15, there was no such thing as people posting a picture of you online and saying horrible shit about your looks and some telling you to kill yourself.

It just wasn't a thing...

And then you say it's the kid being mocked who has the problem and not the vicious people finding pleasure in tearing someone down? 




 If you didn't care ( as you claim) then why did you try to block his calls?

Does not add up. 




 It wasn't always like this.  So many people openly and so vocally being shitty to each other wasn't really around 20 years ago online. 




 Why don't trolls control how we act when interacting in person with each other?

Why do the trolls get to dictate the conversation online? 




 It wasn't always this way.   Seriously, Ive been online since 94. ( interesting you chose that year)

Things have changed and in cases related to disagreement, not for the better.  

You can't disagree with popular sentiment on Reddit, else you'll be insulted, ridiculed and cursed at.

It's pretty strange, as people don't act like that in real life. 




 16 is the age a youth can be kicked out.

You don't believe that there are youths who are so destructive, so abusive, so disruptive and so intent on disrespecting the rules of the home that a parent is not wise to give their child the freedom they so desire by taking away the privilege of living rent free in the home?

I do believe there are unfortunately youths who do in fact deserve to be removed from their homes due to the choices they make and their behaviors.
