 I notice how many more guest where on a one hour show back then as compared to now.  




 And without autotune or samples. 




 Very few performers today exhibit this level of showmanship.   









 This became a meme back then, we didn't know that's what there we're called back then though. 




 But a majority have no opinion.

 Source? Really? Math! If I give you one slice of pizza with 4 oz of meat and 4 oz of bread and I give you another one with 4 oz of meat, but 2 oz of bread, one of those slices would have a higher meat to bread ratio, wouldn't it? 




 Pound for pound, a slice of thin crust pizza would have a higher meat/bread ratio than a traditional slice. 




 So what are the chances that the Rapper and James Blake are roommates? 




 Skene's gland, also known as the paraurethral gland, found in females, is homologous to the prostate gland in males. However, anatomically, the uterus is in the same position as the prostate gland.

 The number next to your name is for link karma. It has nothing to do with how many links you have posted, it is the total amount of times that others Redditors have clicked the "Up" arrow to the left of your link. If one of your links has 5 upvotes, 5 more Redditors have "Liked" your post than have downvoted or "Unliked" it. Each subreddit has it's own rule rules about posting. The more karma you have, the less restrictions there will be on how much you can post, that's why redditors post cat pics and stuff, to build up cheap and easy karma. 




 GOP rep raises concerns over exercise free speech in Capitol 












































 The media have too much invested in the "Us versus Them" narrative. There will always be an opposition party, might not be the one we have now, but there are too many wedge issues for the U.S. to ever be a one party state.

 I guess somebody will be calling for an investigation to find out where Hillary was when it happened.

 One of the sure signs that you live in a dictatorship is when you announce where, and when, you intend to trespass on government controlled land, and invite the press to document it, and jack-all happens.  




 Remember how shocked they were that homeless people had cell phones? 




 The President would have to nominate a successor and then the Senate would have to confirm or reject that nominee, if rejected the President would have to name another nominee but the Standing Rules of the Senate allows one or more Senators to prevent a motion from reaching a vote on the Senate floor.

 In January 1835, then U.S. President Andrew Jackson paid off the entire national debt, the only time in U.S. history that this has been accomplished. However, this accomplishment was short lived as a severe economic depression from 1837 to 1844 caused the national debt to increase to over $3.3 million by January 1, 1838 and it has not been paid in full since.

Betteridge's law of headlines is an adage that states: "Any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no." 




 Is the argument here that if we allow people to offer other people money to do things that they otherwise wouldn't do, there will be a decrease in people using violence to get other people to do things that they otherwise wouldn't do? Like replacing slavery with jobs? 




 Depends on how we would handle drug addiction as a health issue. If we handled it as a personal responsibly issue like cigarettes and alcohol, it would cost us a lot less, probably even generate income in tax revenue. If we handle it as a mental disability, as in those afflicted by the disease would be eligible for entitlements, it might not be more effective than decriminalizing it, just more humane.  




 The problem is, both may be true. Small family farms, averaging 231 acres, make up 88 percent of farms, but 48 percent of total acreage, while very large family farms, averaging 2,086 acres, make up 4.6 percent of farms and 23 percent of total acres. Obama could truthfully say that this bill would affect only 4.6 percent of farms, but Romney could also truthfully say 23 percent of total farm acreage would be affected by this bill.
