 Now I don't like this game. 




 I like this game. 




 Seahawks fans should just be happy it's 13-0, instead of 21-0 like it could be. 




 This is reminding me a lot of Niners-Saints 2011. 




  I never wash jeans. 

If you work a blue-collar job where your jeans get dirty and beat-up, this is bad.  You really need to wash them to preserve the fabric, or it'll wear through pretty fast.  Holes in jeans might be trendy, but not if you need them to stay intact for work. 




 Well, fuck it, I wasn't going to be sober today anyways. 




 I just can't decide who to hate more. 




 The underwear one is goddamned blasphemy.

And yes, I am single. 




 A good reminder of just how much an armored division wasn't actually tanks. 




  An orchard near me lost several dozen bottles in a hurricane one year.

"Lost" 









 Supposedly $1.75 for 5 minutes work, but I can't actually submit the HIT - the "Submit" button doesn't work.  Given the nature of the work, it looks like they're just trying to generate click-throughs to ads.

Anyone else?

Here's the HIT:

 I'm looking to cook up some packaged salmon (it was on sale - don't judge me!) into salmon cakes.  

So, what can I use to hold it firmly into a patty shape instead of egg?  I'm not allergic, or anything, I'm just kind of tire of the taste and texture, and looking for an alternative.

Also - is buttermilk good for frying up salmon cakes?  I was just going to go with flour   breadcrumbs, but it's not chicken ... so I wasn't sure about using buttermilk to fully batter. 

















































 I have a big plastic jar of a vaguely trail-mix type of stuff, including a lot of dried cranberries ... which I don't like.  But I really like both cranberry sauce, and especially cranberry mustard (pref. the Beaver brand).  So can I turn what I've got but don't like, into something I have and do like?

Because I have feeling it's not quite as simple as "mash them up and add them to mustard." 



















 I was mixing a bunch of Type S mortar for brickwork, but got interrupted, and left it overnight with about three inches of water sitting on top of the mixed mortar in a bucket.  So it hasn't been exposed to air, and is still quite soft ... but has anything essentially changed in sitting wet for so long?  Is it still properly usable mortar?  

Or should I just toss it out and start over, wasting nearly half a bag? 




 Like, say, creating a Duke of Maryland, or an Earl of New York.  Seems like it'd be the usual thing to do, but I can't recall hearing of it.  Land grants were handed out, but no titles to go with them - it would've especially made sense in the case of someone like William Penn, where you'd almost expect at least a Baronetcy to be granted. 




 Be it a scent, a fragment of song you catch in passing, whatever - it randomly occurs, and just takes you back. 




 I can't remember if it was a TV show or made-for-TV-movie, but in any case, it was about two brothers (IIRC) crossing the U.S. in a refurbished old biplane.  Fictional, not reality show - this would've been the very late '80s, with a somewhat patriotic theme.

For some reason I associate it with the 1976 Bicentennial, but watched it in the late '80s on broadcast TV. 




 If you were a kid in the '80s, you know what I'm talking.  Slightly grainy, muted-color nature documentaries narrated by a guy with a slightly backwoods accent, and a tendency to treat the animals like people.  You know, "Old fox here, he might've missed out on catching himself a rabbit today, but there's always tomorrow." 














 By my vague, addled understanding, the barrier to detecting particles is mass.  The higher the mass, the more energy you need to detect a particle.  So why was the up quark detected by the relatively low-energy SLAC in the '60s, but the Higgs took until less than two years ago to detect in the *much* higher energy LHC? 




 Because I haven't been able to come up with an answer via Google.  Which positions are associated with which "technique #s"?  I understand what each DL position *does*, it's just this specific terminology I don't know about. 




 Because I really, really doubt there's another school out there that goes by "Volcanoes."  Well, maybe in Hawaii. 









 I have an old 3rd generation iPod Shuffle.  I like to load up lectures onto it to listen to while I work - problem is, once a file hits the 30 minute mark, the iPod skips to the next track.  

Is this a common thing?  Can anything be done about it? 









 Not in their own hand, of course ... but when it comes to people like Horace, Virgil, Tacitus, Cicero, etc., do we have any copies of their works that were published either in their own lifetime, or shortly after?  

Because I've always wondered if we're just relying upon copies of copies of copies of copies, and so on.  Were the humanist scholars of the 14th Century just copying Carolingian documents?  Or did they have original material from Roman and Greek times? 




 I don't want menus, scroll-bars, or whatever.

I want a perfectly black screen with a cursor ... and *not a damned thing else*.  

Does such a word-processing program exist? 




 And yes, I have Open Office, which still surrounds my so-called "full screen" with a bunch of toolbars and brightly lit margins.  I want a black screen that I can knock text into, like something Smith Corona made in 1993. 




 So I'm going to use some canned spinach in a quiche to up the vegetable quotient ... and while I usually like it, it has a very mushy "green" taste to it, if you know what I mean.

Is there something I can to do balance this out?  I was thinking spiciness to cut into the blandness - maybe some chopped jalapenos, and some Sriracha.  Other thoughts? 
























 Especially on /r/nfl, I think.  Basically people saying things like "I was salty as fuck about that call."

Its reddit use doesn't really seem to match the UD definition. 














 Because I'll occasionally see it as a response, like:

doe?

I have the feeling it's a painfully obvious acronym, and I'm going to feel very stupid when it gets explained. 














 So ... have at it. 














 So, I installed the latest version of the Gamefly Downloader, as it's the only way I can re-download a game I had a while back.  Only ... I can't do a damned thing with it.

This: http://i.imgur.com/VLa0E5j.jpg is what it looks like.  Maximizing the window just leads to this: http://i.imgur.com/JLiTN1Q.jpg which is, of course, no better.  There's just no way to sign in.

I've disabled Adblock on my browsers, as recommended by their support FAQ, but still nothing.

If I can't fix this, does anyone know of an alternate way to download from GameFly? 














 Didn't see it in the initial options, so didn't set a reserve price.  I'm starting to regret it - can anything be done? 




 For some reason, I simply can't connect to moddb.com.  Any alternatives?

Also, is the broken single-player campaign fixed in later versions?  I have v. 3.3000, and am aware there's a newer version. 




 Looks like I'm going to have to add them to my hosts file, because my ISP's DNS is crap.

There are plenty of whois tools online, I know, but it seems to be kind of a crap shoot as to which are free and functional, and which you have to pay to get info from. 




 I bought a frozen cornish game hen sort of randomly, and now I'm wondering what to do with it.  All the recipes I've seen are very ... bland.  

More importantly, I thought about stuffing it with wild rice before baking - is there anything else non-bready that I could add to the stuffing?  Not real big on cranberries, so what else could I go with? 




 "The Walking Dead" style zombies, not the "WWZ" nightmare-fuel zombies. 




 I'm talking scans or pictures, not transcribed.  So much of what we know seems to have come from letters and journals - are there any good archives of these?  Preferably in English, any other language and I'd just be seeing examples of handwriting. 




 The package of cheap, Costco-purchased, tailed raw shrimp from Vietnam says to thaw only by leaving for a while in the fridge, and specifically says to not force thaw under cold water.  It doesn't mention microwave thawing or going straight to frying from the freezer at all.

Any particular reason why not? 









 First - is it really a bad idea to use starter fluid in a two stroke engine, especially if the starter fluid has a cylinder lubricant?

Second - Is there such a thing as 10W-30 for diesel engines?  The cap on my Kubota says "10W30D," but I use Delo 15W40. 









 I tried making dolmas a few months ago, and while I enjoyed the filling ... the bitterness of the grape leaves was just too much.  Is there anything that can be done about it? 




 When I click on a thumbnail with a + sign, the images no longer expand to full size right there on the page.  I have to (*quelle horreur*!) actually click on the link to open an image in a new tab.  The + changes to a - without anything anything happening.

I've changed absolutely no settings between when this function still worked, and when it stopped working.

 I know these used to exist, but I'll be damned if I can find one.

I'm basically looking for a program that will download all images on a site within a certain sub-address.  Not something for fuskering (I'm not looking to raid personal archives on Photobucket), but for sites that just have a lot of linked images, even some subreddits here - like, say, downloading a few months worth of pictures from /r/EarthPorn, without having to sit there and right click for hours. 














 I absolutely love what I've read of *A History of Western Civilization*, but I'm wondering if I should bother with the earlier volumes.  I'm concerned they may have been drastically outpaced by new scholarship, especially "Our Oriental Heritage," which was written in the '20s.  I'm not concerned by volumes like "The Age of Voltaire," which was not only written much later (the '60s), but about a more recent and better documented era. 




 Because "He looked to be about sixty, and maybe I was ten, my momma would whup me but I'd go see him again" is way up there.  

So, what other ones? 









 I don't even have pictures of it.  

Anyways, back in the mid-80s (young people can go ahead and just leave now), a local pizza place had a billboard-style game on one wall.  It was about 6' x 3', and was played with an IR remote.  

There was a illustration of a hunter holding a shotgun standing in some reeds with a dog, and there were five cut-out positions for the shotgun.  They'd light up individually as you directed with the controller.  The ducks were also lit up sections of an otherwise black panel, and you'd have to have the gun aimed at the right angle to hit one.

Anyone else remember this? 














 So, I have a desk lamp made of wood and metal.

If it's off, I can touch any metal part and it will turn on. Another touch, it becomes brighter.  A third touch, it goes to its brightest.  A fourth touch ... it turns off.

There seem to be no moving parts.  So what, exactly, is going on here?  Are there moving parts inside of the (very small) wooden core, that switch around like those in a car's turn signal? 




 Please use them.  Seriously, you can't smell yourselves, but those of us that live in the towns you pass through *can*. 
























 I have to constantly do factory resets to get it back up to full volume.  Is this a common problem?  I'll probably move on to the latest iPod Touch this summer, but for now this is really annoying. 
























 Because for the "Greenville" quake, we're up to about 300, a decent number of them in the 3.0-4.9 range.  Is this normal? 




 Lagunitas Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale, here.  About to temporarily switch to water.

The rest of you? 




 Just had a moderately strong one here in northern Plumas County.  Everything just shook and rolled for about fifteen to twenty seconds, and I could actually hear the rumble.

Kind of neat, but slightly disturbing, given that an active volcano is less than twenty miles away (Lassen) - I thought it must be erupting.

Anyone got any info?

EDIT: A 5.7-5.9, according to the USGS.  Epicenter was about eight miles away. 




 Preferably in English.  I'm kind of curious as to how right they get things.  Also, may as well exclude Canadians.

I'm just wondering if there's like a Russian equivalent of Elizabeth George. 





























 Perhaps not strictly following the guidelines of "events prior to the past twenty years," but I feel it fits the spirit of the subreddit.  Namely - who do you, professional or amateur historians - consider the worst published writer of history who is fairly well known?  Thus excluding revisionist cranks or other fools.  First nomination: Norman Davies. 















































































  Wise Man's Fear so quickly almost broke him, and it isn't quite as as polished.

There were also a couple of pretty blatant author's mistakes that he might've otherwise caught ... 




  For the millionth freaking time, the search function is terrible because nobody titles their post to reflect what it is.

Yeah, which is why the search function should be able to *search comments*, which would be hugely useful.  Not to mention being able to search by userid, or even just search my own comment history. 




 How is that relevant to this? 




 Or developing a better search function. 




  Spent like 10 consecutive hours watching the most god-forsaken movies.

The touch screen on the seat in front of you, on a tube of aluminum travelling 600mph at 30,000 feet to Africa, didn't have a great movie selection.

Truly we live in horrible times. 




  I don't want to pay for somebody else's health 

If you have private health insurance, that's exactly what you're doing.  I'm not sure if you get this, but a lot of other people honestly think that their premiums only go towards their own care. 




 Significantly less than 100% actually had the means to do so. 




 You're drunk early. 




 Also I haven't really decided what part of Cali to visit either.

You know California is[ rather large](http://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/m6mos/california_in_perspective_for_east_coasters_usa/)?  Because you're going to want to narrow it down. 




 Is this more of a suburban and/or East-coast thing?

Because I live in a place where the snow   rain would seem to demand it (well, most years), but no one does.  While a lot of people have hardwood or laminate floors, even people with carpet don't bother. 




  i would think even a WW2 era U-boat could sneak up on many modern ships under electric power.

Doubtful - subs make a lot more noise than just from their energy source.  Just the prop or shaft noise from a U-boat could no doubt be heard by any halfway decent modern warship from miles away. 




 Because it sure doesn't read that way in the books, but the Pandora station I've got set up is bland to the point of falling asleep.  Thin, reedy, pluck-ish ... lute music seems to lack depth and passion.  

It's the kind of music I can see being played in the background of a dinner in Georgian London, with everyone talking severely and quietly and otherwise being staid and boring. 




 HMS *Invincible*, which wasn't. 




 Depending on where you live, you might want to try the Home Energy Assistance Program.  I'm headed that way myself in the next few days, for the same reason (48hr. notice).

[LIHEAP](http://liheap.findfamilyresources.com/?k=liheap p= c=15581642716932583403 ad=41950200739 mt=b nk=g ca= mb= ai= a=aw gclid=CMPZuLamuMMCFQGUfgodaywAkg). 




 The full length "Watchmen" trailer with the Smashing Pumpkins music.

That, or the first time seeing the "Independence Day" trailer, which I believe was during the Super Bowl in '96. 




  The Dad jeans don't hug the legs at all, they give no sense of shape, make a fit guy look less fit

And they're a whole lot easier to do physical labor in, which is the point for some of us. 




 I'm pointing out that there seem to be enough exceptions to the rule, so as to make your title untrue. 




 McKiernan:  Hey, I totally want to write a sequel to Lord of the Rings.

Tolkien Estate:  No, you can't do that.

McKiernan: (*Does it anyways.*) 




 Rothfuss claims he hasn't read the WoT. 




 It isn't on the old clock I have, or on any clock that uses Roman numerals that I've ever seen. 




 We've been living a lie, my friends. 




  Now it owes it's independence to France. Did they also fight all the battles an declare independence too?

You really need to read up on the Revolutionary War - the nascent U.S. was heavily supported by French money, and a lot of French troops and naval forces.  There were almost as many French troops at Yorktown as American, and it was the French fleet that fought the British fleet in the Battle of Chesapeake Bay to force the British surrender at Yorktown. 




 And it's not like they have a whole lot to spare ... 




  The family wasn't struggling 

And now you know why. 




 Your post has 64 words and zero facts.

That's a pretty impressive ratio - I couldn't even do that on purpose. 




  I had 3 colonoscopes performed by the age of 23

Yeah ... you weren't really there to check for cancer, were you? 




 "Cloud aiming" or "pixel aiming" was a quick way to get banned from some servers, though.  It was real obvious when you were doing it. 




 Huh, that's the same code as the lock on my luggage. 




 Nothing in particular, but damned if I wouldn't at this point. 




 Anything involving physical pain.  Pretty much that. 




 Everything in my life.

Sorry, I meant EVERYTHING FUCKING THING in my life.

From being so broke I'm soon to be evicted, to the fact that I haven't so much as touched a girl in nearly six years and I'm still in my 30s, to that fact that I can't get a job and I don't know why even when plenty of people are willing to speak up for and recommend me, to the fact that fuck this.  Just fuck this. 




  Dems will bankroll candidates the exact same way as the Koch brothers and spend just as much money doing so.

Again, [citation needed].

Scale matters.  The Koch brothers throwing nearly a billion into an election cycle, or Sheldon Adelson cutting $10 million checks to Newt Gingrich, is slightly different from Soros tossing a million or two to a progressive PAC every now and then.

Hell, Texas oil billionaires probably spent more money on Swiftboating Kerry in 2004 than Soros has spent on Democrats *ever*. 




 Yep, that was the one.  If it was about 2001-2003, I probably killed you a few times, or got killed by you. 




  I fell out the back of that AC-130 a few too many times though (when the pilot decided to climb fast).

It's a good thing literally everyone in the game was magically carrying a parachute, then. 




 I'm noticing a complete and utter lack of hard numbers, or even soft numbers. 




 Does the id "21st_Panzer" ring any bells?  That was our clan name.  We played all day, every day, or at least we did on weekends, and then we moved on to BF2.  Our preference was for the WOLF servers, which are apparently still running. 




 I've read two of them - *Night of Knives* was decent, because it was minimal.  It didn't try to be epic, it just told an interesting background story in a sparse, action-laden fashion.  *Return of the Crimson Guard* tried way too hard to be epic, and failed.  

ICE has a tendency towards bad prose, and just throwing a bunch of things into the story without really blending them.  He covers all the plot elements required, but not smoothly. Very choppy, jumps-around type of work.  And he frequently underwhelms with his revelations of big mysteries.  Something will get hugely built up, and then when you find out the secret, it's like ... "That's it?  Seriously?" 




 Get elected President first, and we will.

One of the perks of the job. 




 [citation needed] 




 Unfortunately, it's ICE that's going to be writing the prequels about Dancer and Kellanvad. 




 One of my best gaming moments was shooting down a MiG-29 with the howitzer on an AC-130, while it was passing by in the opposite direction, in a BF1942 mod called "Desert Combat."  

The other guy was both pissed and admiring at the same time. 




 "The Pentagon Wars" is satire, designed to make the anti-Bradley bureaucrats look silly.  Too many people don't get this, and think it's the generals that look like fools. 




 It would've been useful as a target, not much else - it was poorly designed, and the Germans had *zero* carrier experience.  They would've had to learn on the fly in a shooting war against a vastly superior navy. 




 Seeing my bank account balance. 




 Such a huge part of my childhood, and in a picture format that I remember from and associate with that time.  Thanks. 




 Like the X-29, but less polite. 




  Makes it sound like a different planet.

Well, that's not entirely inaccurate. 




 Lots and lots of snow, like there should be this time of year. 




 @JesusNazareth: They said I was hung, and they was right. 




 I didn't know her name, just respected her for her ability to escape from a bear trap. 




 I've never eaten macaroni and cheese that didn't have a shape. 




 A bit touchy about being called out on being completely wrong, now aren't you?  I directly quoted how wrong you are. 




 You said, direct quote: "Republicans got more votes."

They empirically didn't. 




 You have very poor reading comprehension.  I'm pointing out that, contrary to recent Republican claims, capturing a simple majority in Congress does not mean that the party that does so represents the will of a majority of the country.

Also, you might want to drag yourself out of 1983, because currently a majority of Americans favor gay marriage.

 There was a much larger population of girls that wouldn't sleep with me in college. 




 Get drunk, masturbate, weep bitterly. 




 I spent a couple summers working at a marina, and let me tell you ... the girls that vacationed there were not in the least bit modest. 




  Oh, so you're saying Democrats lost because Republicans got more votes.

Actually, they didn't.

http://www.vox.com/2015/1/3/7482635/senate-small-states/in/5654656

"the 46 Democratic caucus members in the 114th Congress received a total of 67.8 million votes in winning their seats, while the 54 Republican caucus members received 47.1 million votes."

But you just keep on telling everyone how the current Congress represents the will of the people, and has some kind of mandate. 




  Gerrymandering by race is against the law

Oh, well, gosh, guess that means it doesn't happen.  It's *against the law*, after all. 




 Were any of them from an Axis country? 




 Or even at least once.

 In the late Sixties, Milton Bradley created the game Battleship, which introduced the catch phrase You sank my battleship to the general public.

It is still the shortest and most accurate history of the battleship to date.

Perfect. 




  I actually think that its the Maer.

The Maer Alveron is very likely King at the time of the framing in Newerre - the King's soldiers are wearing Alveron's colors (white and blue), and it's doubtful that there's been enough time for him to have sired an heir, and that heir to have grown up and taken the throne. 




 In the category of *very* minor characters, I still think Geoffrey completely scammed Denna.  Maybe Devi's in on it and gets a cut, I don't know. 




 No, I'm saying that doesn't particularly make them any better or worse than many other countries of equal strength and regional involvement.

But some people talk like they're the next coming of Nazi Germany, which is a really stupid, counterproductive mindset. 




 Remember that guy who called Iran a member of the "Axis of Evil"?  He spent eight years representing the entire Republican Party. 




  Poor Iran, such a bullied victim.

Feel free to name all the countries that Iran's invaded in its modern existence.

Hint:  None. 




 These are the only two pictures I could dig up - I've sold a bunch more, but have a bad habit of not taking pictures of them when I do.  If I can get some customers to send me photos, I'll add them to the album.

I tend to focus on more rural, casual scenes.  Very reasonable prices, especially right now. 









  He's just too far back in the peerage for it to ever happen. 

While this is possibly true, that peerage is getting thinned out.

And I thinks it's a bit of foreshadowing that the birds Kvothe chose to get killed by Caudicus' poison have the same name as the royal line of Vintas. 




 Noted and done. 




 Plumas. 




 In fact, my very patient landlord waited way past 60 days, I'm more like 90 behind, and he finally sent the 30-day notice.  Currently unemployed and worked a cash job over the summer/fall, so no UI. I've scraped up one month's rent ($350), but live in a rural area where there's just no day-work, almost no social services (I have no kids, so don't qualify for any county or state - California - help), and very very few jobs available.  If I had anything valuable to sell, I would, but I never really have.

The usual work I do in the winter is dependent upon getting snow, and we (rural NE California), well, *haven't*.  I'm not looking to raise $1000 from redditors, but literally anything would help at this point.

So I'm just sort of tossing this out there with a little more than a week left.  I just wish I was a cat who needed surgery or something - I'm not a huge sob story, just financially desperate over a bad winter.

EDIT:  PM me for Paypal details. 




  in Skarpi's story, Lanre and the Creation War, it's said that the "the enemy was set beyond the doors of stone".

Felurian says the same thing, which to my mind is a bit more credible. 




 Because they don't get along with the 51st state. 




  Sorry if this is a dead subject.

It has been for about 150 years. 




 I think Clancy went a little crazy after Clinton got elected. 




 Probably because it's a technical field demanding highly trained workers. 




 Look, we take our bacon seriously.

And we don't mean that Canadian shit either. 




 If Ticonderogas were ice cream, they'd taste like Praline and dick. 




 Woohoo!

I'm still four months behind on rent, but I have Gold, so I can at least be entertained in the meantime before eviction.

Which, completely and utterly honestly, is nice.  Like the song says, it's the simple things that make me smile. 




 No, it isn't.  It's never my fucking lucky day. 




  Chlorine Triflouride

That must be Patrick Rothfuss' inspiration for bone-tar. 




 That's like complaining about the visitor's lockers not having hot water for the showers - in the '80s, you should have just expected it as routine fuckery. 




 My birthday is July 21st - all that neat, new information coming back from Pluto is going to make a nice early present. 




 Not behind that line, you don't. 




 I prefer to believe this. 




 The *Kentucky* chipping in, to be precise.  They should've brought *USS* *Camden* in just to complete the picture. 




  But for whatever reason, that shitty pre-sliced bread is really popular in the US. 

You know ... that stuff is really, really good for a couple of things.  First:  well-buttered toast.  Generic American sliced white bread just makes really good toast.  Because I don't want an overly-strong flavor like sourdough or whatever first thing in the morning.

And second, grilled-cheese sandwiches, with the equally-derided Kraft American cheese slices on them.  Two over-priced, over-processed piles of chemicals that only vaguely resemble their namesakes, but when you put them together are so goddamn delicious.

EDIT:  I'll toss in a third thing:  Cheap grade-school sandwiches with lots of mayo.  Namely, ham-and-cheese using cheap, tangy, fatty mayo and mass-produced deli sliced ham.  Or with Oscar Meyer bologna, which probably isn't even a real meat, but with enough mayo and mustard on Wonderbread is really, really tasty. 




  My girlfriend and I live in Sacramento where the water is pretty good.

I lived in Davis for quite a while - the water is far worse than Sacramento.  The water towers look neat, but what comes out of them is awful. 




 Nice of them to specify ice glaciers, so we don't get them confused with some other kind. 




 Source?  Because I'm currently living in a 90%+ white county (Plumas), that's not on the map.  In fact, there's at least one other (Sierra) just in California that aren't listed. 




 I'm especially talking about things with complex recipes, where the store-bought version has a long shelf-life but the home-made version has to be used fairly fast.

In my case, it's Caeser dressing - started doing so a week ago, and I'll never go back to the bottled stuff, though there are plenty of decent brands out there.  I still haven't done ranch because of the short fridge-life of buttermilk, but that's probably up next. 




 Woohoo!  Four months behind on rent, this is just the ticket to get out of a bad situation!  And not get evicted in a few weeks. 




 I believe those are called "Hot House" cucumbers here, usually from Mexico. 




  I have not heard of any place in the US that you can't drink the water.

You've clearly never been to the California Central Valley - it won't kill, it'll just make you swear off water.  Like drinking from a pool. 




 5. American bread is sooo sweet. The crust is also really weird. It's not crispy. It's soft. Like not crust, but still crust.

That's common, mass-produced, generic store-bought sliced bread.  Any decent grocery store will also have a bakery making *much* better stuff. 




 I believe this is the thread you were looking for:

For preparedness reasons?  Because California != L.A. 90% of the state doesn't resemble L.A. even remotely. 




 The Saints got schooled. 




  Washing slowly destroys clothes.

Yeah, but not nearly as fast as *not* washing them. 




 So what's a good stream for those of us with bad connections?  Because every post seems focused on the streams with the highest bandwidth and resolution.  If I could afford that kind of connection ... I wouldn't need a stream. 




 It's pretty much the same team the Niners beat the last two meetups, last season twice. 




 What the fuck is going on?  Just what the fuck? 
























 NorCal here, stuck with DigitalPath.  It's either that or Frontier where I live. 




 RIP in peace, Big Stick. 




  Citizens should get to use the newly built DMV facilities across the state.

They can.  Absolutely nothing in the article you linked says that facilities are off-limits to legal citizens, just that they were built in response to an expected increase in demand.

There are *NO* immigrant-only DMV facilities.
 




 Along with some less than beautiful clear-cuts. 




  IIRC, the Feds closed the land in the 80s/90s, shutting down the timber industry.

The "timber industry" is doing just fine, including cutting on public lands.  They just have good anti-government PR that has everyone convinced that those poor, poor multi-billion dollar companies are struggling to get by thanks to the evil federal government.

The real fight is competition with cheaper foreign lumber. 




  China isn't expansionist, aside from Tibet. 

Russia, Vietnam, India, South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines would beg to differ. 




 That's right, we can't.  You being a prime example. 




 Yeah, we pretty much got this one. 




 Have some liquor ready.

It's Valentine's Day - way ahead of you. 




 Eh, the Burkes are pretty capable in that regard, equipped almost identically to the OHPs. 




 No, because it actually makes sense. 




 The way the weather's been in NorCal the past month or so, it could easily be in the '60s in the daytime. 




 I honestly don't remember.  I was born in '78, so he was Governor for most of my childhood, and I thought of him as Governor Marmaduke. 




  We could use another Pete Wilson,

No one could use another Pete Wilson. 




  George Deukmejian

Wow ... there's a name I haven't heard in a while. 




  Mccain and Romney were heirs apparent?

They've both sort of made a career out of running/possibly running for President. 




  Patrick Willis for the next 5 years as well?

He just turned 30 a couple of weeks ago, and ILBs seem to have a pretty long prime for some reason. 




  a dismal performance by the RN in my opinion.

Somewhat better flying and munitions handling by the Argentines, and it would've been a hell of a lot worse.  The RN got off easy, considering the opportunities the Argentines had to really wreck that fleet. 




 But ... but ... you aren't /u/silence_hr! 




 Fiberglass would work. 




 It's Kings Creek Meadow, a pretty popular spot for pictures. 




 Olympic is fine.

But a pump sprayer is going to take you just as long as a roller, if not longer, and won't apply as well - it tends to stand on the surface a bit instead of working in.  You're better off just biting the bullet and investing the time in rolling. 




 Any Malazan army, really.  They have a tendency to get wiped out in short order (while giving even worse than they get, of course). 




 You must be very drunk to have things so backwards.

See, I'm the guy providing evidence.  He's the guy making unsubstantiated assertions. 




 Colin Kaepernick was somewhat of a mess in 2014, with his inconsistency becoming problematic as his numbers dropped across the board despite a lot of support on both sides of the ball.

Ah, yes, that support that included about seventeen third-stringers, an OC that play-called with a Ouija board, and a formerly All-Pro Tight End that acted like he was out for a morning stroll once the ball was snapped. 




  I really like watching Aaron Rodgers lose.

So you enjoy watching the 49ers win? 




  Am I reading this wrong or is the US listed as zero war casualties?

The map seems to be about *where* the deaths occurred, not the country-of-origin of the people doing the dying.  That's why South Korea has so many, I suppose. 




   I believe the University is made up of more than just the arcanum. 

This is correct - it seems a lot of students are there to study more academic fields from the best teachers the Four Corners has to offer.  It seems that Simmon originally went to the University for exactly this sort of education, and Kvothe at first pretends to Threpe that's what he's there for. 




 Two weeks later, let me say that that's exactly the sort of thing I'm looking for.  I followed to another video of his where is seriously sounded like he was playing three damned tunes at the same time.

*That's* the kind of music Rothfuss writes about. 




 I'm not the one espousing conspiracy theories. 




 There are a few anecdotes in the KKC (more specifically AWMF) that Rothfuss drew on from real history, and in both cases French 18th Century history:

1.) Kvothe makes a joke to Denna in Severen about a certain lady losing her virginity in a theater box.  This is based on Julie de Lespinasse, who *actually did* lose her virginity (aged 42) in a Parisian opera box in 1770, to Comte Jacques-Antoine de Guibert.  She confirms this - or at least *claims* this - in letters to him.

2.) Fela's "Interesting Things" story about blind people who have their site restored, and have to be taught how to identify shapes by looking at them. To quote Will Durant from "The Age of Voltaire":

"[Diderot] was especially attracted by a question which the Irishman William Molyneux had raised about 1692: Will a man born blind who has learned to distinguish a cube from a sphere by touch, be able, if his sight is restored, to differentiate at once a cube from a sphere, or will he require, before he can make this distinction, some experience of the relations between forms touched and the same forms seen?  The latter answer had been given by Molyneux and his friend [John] Locke.

"In 1728 Willian Cheselden operated successfully upon a fourteen-year-old boy who had been blind from birth; the boy had to be trained before he could differentiate forms by sight alone."


I'd also note that 18th Century French history, as well as 16th   17th Century Renaissance history, is filled with the sort of polymathic geniuses that, if they only existed in fiction, would be decried as Mary Sues/Gary Stus.  

You know ... like Kvothe, but without the benefit of living in a world with true magic to become brilliant at.  If sympathy   sygaldry existed in the real world, men like Benjamin Franklin and Voltaire would've been the Kvothes of our history.  Can you imagine Leonardo di Vinci getting his hands on sygaldry? 




 I know who he is.  But, you see, you've wandered out of the World Nutjob Daily fever swamp - and into a place concerned with *facts* and *reality*, where the Scary Black Secret Muslim *wasn't* fathered by a Scary Black Communist.  Where Frank Davis was simply a friend of Obama's grandfather, a left-wing labor and civil rights advocate.  Where people don't hide under their bed from the FEMA black helicopters. 




 Pretty sure absolutely no-one, ever, in all of mankind, has ever hated not being *you*. 




 I wonder what brand of tin-foil you prefer. 




 Now do your own damn research, instead of carrying around goal posts because of what you don't want to believe.

Yes, he should have passed that bill in Congress, like the President totally has the power to do.

 If only there were some sort of easily accessible website where you could find out about his college life.  Better yet, some kind of combination of words, printed on paper, perhaps written by the person in question. 




 It's a 30 year average. Large parts of California *do*, normally, receive decent amounts of precipitation.  There's just a stark contrast with the parts that normally *don't*.

 U.S. Territories are, by definition, part of the U.S. 




 Puerto Rico is part of the US. 




 /r/badscience ----- is that way. 




 The government can tell us what to eat

No, it can't. 

It can determine what meals are served at public schools, which isn't remotely the same. 




 I started reading the *Wheel of Time* in 1989, when *Eye of the World* was first released.

A lot of people here probably weren't even born then. 




 Once you find yourself slogging through Book Nine, you'll wish it would. 




  Didn't she say her grandmother taught them to her?

That was Deoch. 




 It's pretty unlikely.  Nobility tend to guard their choice of livery, and the Maer strikes me as someone who would be more inclined than most not to be mis-represented. 




 Yes ... but in a SHTF situation, that mined salt will suddenly no longer be available.  So it'll suddenly be more valuable. 




 Those are the areas that would be flooded ... with *love*. 




 That's because it's mined from massive underground deposits.

If that ease of mining and distribution breaks down ... it'll skyrocket in value. 




  Here's me now

I've ... I've actually done that.  Probably had the same expression, too, but I'm white, so it wasn't quite as casually not-giving-a-fuck. 




 So did I, but the power was out for four days, so it wasn't really by choice. 




 Salt.  It's pretty damned hard to come by if you don't live next to an ocean, and it's very, very important for preservation. 




 I have "Catfish Billy" stuck in my head, and I was totally expecting to click on this thread and seeing someone mention a Yelawolf song.

You have disappointed me. 




 That ... was surprisingly accurate for the first thirty or forty seconds.

But it was pretty '80s after that. 




 That was actually pretty typical in the '90s.  Kids these days have it easy. 




  It's hard to believe, but i've always subscribed to idea that it's cheaper for one to just buy a prepared meal at a restaurant then go out and buy $20-$30 for stuff to cook some thing.

I just have to ask ... were you raised in a wealthy household?

Because I just can't imagine this mindset from a functioning adult who wasn't waited on hand and foot growing up. 




  Does anyone even care that Jerry Rice did?

I think the problem is that now, a lot of other receivers from that era can *claim* they didn't, whether they did or not, to make themselves look better.

But much like pine-tar or scuffing the ball for more than a century of major league pitching, we all know everyone did it. 




 Depends on what kind of aim Buffalo fans have. 




 My nickname for this coaching staff is "The Parliament."

Because much like a group of owls, all that I can hear is "Who? Who? Who?" 




 The two soldiers who beat up Kvothe/Kote were wearing blue and white - which are Alveron's colors (described in Severen as "ivory and sapphire).  And we know they're in Vint because the "king's coin" that  Aaron was looking to take was a gold noble. 




 "Do we have enough radars?"

"No."

"... OK, just added a few more radars, do we have enou-"

"NO!  MORE!" 




 Alveron IS one of my Top 3 candidates to be the Killed King

Except Alveron is still alive in the present-day frame.  There's really no one else who could be King, and wearing his colors.
 




  Because of the Hoover dam, the Colorado River doesn't even remotely reach the ocean anymore. 

That's because massive amounts of water are diverted for agriculture, industry, and residential use in California   Arizona (esp. California). 




 And now it's snowing, at a lower altitude than predicted (4500' where I'm at).  So ... that should be pretty damned helpful.

  Are American biscuits anything like regular toast?

No.  Just ... no.  A proper Southern-style biscuit is in its own category of taste altogether.  Flaky, fluffy, a tad buttery, a bit savory ... and now I need a plate full. 




  This[2]  is apparently what an American calls a biscuit. This is a scone. It is a sweet

And there's where you've got it wrong.  There's nothing sweet about biscuits, especially Southern biscuits (which is what you put some nice, thick, sausage gravy over). 




  Many an American claims to be part Cherokee...

Well ... it's actually true for a lot of us.  The Cherokee moved around quite a bit, though not by choice. 




 Brain damage. 




  Manziel was extremely successful in college,

  Davis is definitely the place to live if you like to bicycle and walk.


Seconding, thirding, and fourthing this.

Hell, I didn't *want* to drive when I lived in Davis (except to work in Woodland), simply because it's such a nice place to ride a bike, walk, or take a bus.  The Downtown grid, the Arboretum, the campus, all the little parks (Central, Chestnut, that one on Lake, etc.) ... very non-driving friendly.

 




 That was encouraging.

 Part of the problem is that some counties cover a very wide range of altitudes.  This is especially obvious in eastern California - some of those narrow east-west counties start at 1-200 feet, and top out at anywhere from 6-10,000.

Colusa County, for example, is the Sacramento Valley, with a low point of about 45', and a high point of 7,055; Placer County goes from 145' to more than 9000', the high end being in the rather snowy (most years) Tahoe region.

 If someone's paying taxes into the system, they should get paid back out same as anyone else.  Makes the whole system work a lot better. 




  It's not the government's job to protect people from their own stupidity or bad decisions.

No, it's the government's job to protect me from *other people's* stupidity or bad decisions.  Hence mandatory immunization, food safety laws, laws against drunk driving, etc. 




 I got twenty+ detailed questions in, then suddenly it said "no more room available in this group" or some such, and ended the survey.  This is the kind of fishing BS I expect from Survey Savvy or whoever, not an mTurk survey.

 From a recent birth announcement in my local paper:  Paytin and Idalise.  Born to a couple named Kinderlin and Tristan.

 WTF are you rambling about? 




  Ever had a younger sibling start a new pokemon adventure after a hundred plus hours?

Worse - Final Fantasy III (SNES) after more than a hundred hours.

 Immunization rates by country -

WHO:

http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tscoveragebcg.html

UNICEF:

http://data.unicef.org/child-health/immunization

These are very well known facts.  But hey, you have Youtube videos showing poor funny-talking poor brown people, right? 




  Also, what makes one a "personal issue" and not the other?

The fact that one is *dangerously contagious*, and the other *isn't*.

You're trying real hard to force an equivalency that doesn't exist. 




 Or, you know, maybe some of us are capable of reading WHO statistics on immunization.

http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tswucoveragebcg.html

It's almost like immunization is a very cheap, wide-spread process that even Third World countries see high levels of.  But all you know is "herr derpy derr brown people eat shit and are dirty derpity derr." 




 The article you linked to just makes you look even more stupid.  Great job on that. 




  Those counties happen to be the most liberal in the country.

Orange county is fairly conservative. 




 You'll be a pretty short drive from King's Canyon and Sequoia National Parks, which are spectacular, and less crowded than Yosemite. 




 Niners fan checking in.

Now you *almost* know how we feel about shitty last-second Super Bowl play-calling.  Except it was one play, not four, and you had last year.

But yeah, it sucks, doesn't it? 




 Well, that was the most thorough case of shooting one's self in the foot I've ever seen. 




 That felt a lot more like Seattle losing than Tom Brady winning. 




 Are there any *lower* bandwidth streams out there?

If I could afford the kind of connection for what's being posted, I could afford not to stream. 




 Well, they've done college basketball games on a carrier, wonder how hard it would be to do a full-sized football game? 




 DDH-142 *Hiei*, that would be. 




 See above. 




  Do you have examples? I didn't see any personally, I'd love to see what I missed. Purely out of curiosity.

The three that stood out:
First, when Kvothe, Sim, and Wil were demonstrating sympathy to Denna, Kvothe as narrator says that she had never seen sympathy before. Except she had, in Trebon, when he lit that shingle on fire.

Second, when in Severen, Denna mocks him for even mentioning the Chandrian, when she was fully on-board - at length - in Trebon in wondering what the Chandrian were up to. Unless she's completely amnesiac about literally everything that happened in Trebon, this makes no sense.

Third, Mola didn't recognize Auri in NotW, when she should have according to what we're told in WMF: that all the girls at the University live in the same wing of the Mews, and all know each other. Mola's been there for about five years, Auri is apparently about twenty (give or take a year), they would've met while Auri was a student.

EDIT:  Also, Kvothe shouldn't have been surprised to learn that Sim's father was a duke.  After all, that's one of the first things he's told about Sim in NotW. 
























 And by boards ... they meant actual boards.  Like from a hardware store. 









 Look at his posting history.  He's an arrogant, incredibly shallow narcissistic trust-fund baby, with a sociopathic "fuck you, I've got mine" bent.

 Some of them just naturally deserve to be gilded, like this one.

 There's a Butt Lake and a Butt Mountain not too far from Butte County, so your inner 8 year-old can still have fun. 




 Yes, the [Modoc Plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modoc_Plateau). 




 The KKC world. 




 This was triggered by rereading Kvothe lamenting the cold food in the different rooms the Maer put him in.  ... why is a skilled sympathist complaining about cold food, instead of linking the plates or food to the candles in the room and heating it all up?  Or to a bit of ash from the kitchen fireplace, which would always be going?

So what other things do you think you could come up with - if you were in that world and skilled at both sympathy and sygaldry.  Sygaldric telegraphs would be obvious, if limited by distance (five-to-six miles). 




 Yep - here's a picture I took a while back driving up I-5.  They just sort of pop up out of the middle of farmland:

 Hmmm ... I think the database is flawed.  Looking at Lassen Volcanic National Park, a lot of those lines are hiking trails, not roads.  Doesn't seem to be a problem with other National Parks, though. 









 It doesn't have to *melt* it (though that's possible, at the hottest temperature for Jet A to combust), it just has to *weaken* the steel beams.  Steel and other metals become weak enough to bend far below their melting point. 




 Sorry for the dog analogy. I'm trying to housebreak a damn dog

No problem - we're trying to housebreak Oklahoma, but they keep shitting in the Senate. 




 ... yes, I did.  Repeatedly.  Again, you're far too stupid to realize how wrong you are.  The fact that you're an anti-vaxxer makes that clear, all of your posts here make it even more clear. 




 You obviously don't know what a strawman is.  Let's add it to your list of extraordinary ignorance. 




  So what good is a vaccine if it doesn't work?

It's called "herd immunity."  And it works for most people.  That's the whole damned point. 




 No, they were caused by seat belts working exactly as intended.

Vaccine injuries and deaths don't occur because the vaccine didn't work as intended, they occur because there are a *lot of people*, so some of them are going to have adverse reactions.

There are people allergic to peanuts, you know.  Should we ban peanuts? 




  How many more next month?

There will be a whole lot less than the number of people FUCKING DEAD from whooping cough, polio, rickets, and measles if those vaccines weren't issued.

Does this not even register with you? 




  If there were 117 injuries or deaths caused by faulty seat belts there would be outrage. 

There are three million injuries caused by seat belts a year, resulting in about 40,000 deaths.

So, you know, just keep on being stupid and poorly informed. 




 Yes, because preventing hundreds of thousands of deaths is completely trumped by preventing dozens of injuries. 




 I think you meant http://www.reddit.com/r/datgap, regardless.

No.  You really, really suck at analogies.  Stop. 




  one of the officers said several times that the man was reaching for his gun...

"Oh, then perhaps it would make sense that I should stop him from doing that by restraining him. Nope, better shoot him a bunch of times."

  Which is when police are allowed to shoot your ass.

No ... no, it isn't.  But feel free to cite policy that says otherwise. 




 Yes, it's horrible how reddit has an "anti-shooting unarmed people for no fucking reason" circle-jerk.

It's not like we just watched a goddamned video where we can clearly see that happening or anything.

 So I'm wondering how to gain that store-bought *sharpness* to my home-made Caesar dressing.  That sort of bite that a lot of bottled brands have, but that I just can't reproduce.

Anyways, numbers are real rough (eyeballed mostly), and I usually lay it on the heavy side with seasonings:

Mayo (store bought), 2 cup

Anchovie paste, 2 tbsp

Worcestershire Sauce 2 tbsp

Lemon Juice, 1 tsp

White vinegar, 1 tsp

Crushed garlic, 1 tbsp

Onion powder, 1 tsp

Salt, 1 tsp

Pepper, 1/2 tsp


But while it doesn't lack *flavor* (which is usually great), per se, it lacks that bite on the tongue.  It's just ... a bit too smooth and creamy.  I'm not looking to add heat, mind, so definitely not peppers/hot sauce, unless that's definitely the thing to do.  And I'm not looking to make a vinaigrette. Any possible suggestions?  Even maybe MSG?  I've thought about using plain Greek yogurt instead of mayo, but that's a bit expensive.

 "Forgot who I was" being the key phrase.  A bit of the way through kicking ass ... he remembered he wasn't supposed to be the kind of person who could do so. 




 Why unsuccessful?  The weather was somewhat windy, but there's not nearly as much snow as usual up there. 




 So radical Muslims wanted to use their Second Amendment rights to kill Obama?

Must be some seriously exploding Teabagger heads right about now. 




  rake the desert for ten hours.

Please tell me it was with a really big comb. 




  Its much easier and happier for Kvothe to just struggle to get a new patron than to have the emotional turmoil of getting Greyfallow.

The fact that we never see any of this even remotely touched upon in the books means ... plot hole. 




  Lettuce is the vegetable with just about the shortest shelf-life....

A head of romaine usually keeps for about ten to fourteen days for me. 




  I'd like to steer clear of the recent trend of signing old veteran WRs past their brief primes.

Like that Boldin guy?
 




 While true, *Paul's Boutique* is the superior album.

Though I've been able to sing the lyrics to "Paul Revere" word for word since I was like ten. 




  gruden never shuts up ~~about that game~~

 




  As for the Breden evidence, I have two major problems with it. First, it seems a little too easy to figure out.

I'd point out that to the average, non-obsessive fantasy reader, it probably is subtle enough to require a bit of chewing on mentally. 




 Shorter Answer:  Plot-hole. 




  And for the Whiners must be because we pretty much put the last nail on the coffin for their best HC since the 90s. 

It's come out that the Seahawks loss did that.  Not that it makes losing to the Raiders any easier, of course.
 




  from Fresno and go to school in Davis.

Talk about an upgrade. 




  businessmen are amoral pieces of shit without a shred of decency.

Class warfare detected.  You aren't supposed to say bad things about rich people, citizen. 




 Pretty sure that's supposed to be Fresno.

Bakersfield is actually California's asshole, not armpit. 




 I'd love to live there ... with some means of not dying of starvation and dehydration, of course. 




 You mean Sam the Not Actually A Plumber? 




  Also use an unlubricated condom to keep microphones dry without impacting sound too much.

Oh, good, I finally have a reason to buy condoms. 




 Hmmm, I've been infrequently using the same bottle for three years.  I should stop doing that - no infections, it's just not actually working anymore. 




 There's plenty of nice places in the north valley. 




  Speakng of Bredon, it occurs to me that he may have no social standing prior to his introduction and games of Tak with Kvothe.

Bredon has enough wealth   standing to have a couple of servants rushing around for him setting up table and chairs in Kvothe's room, as well to be talked about in the gossip of the nobility (the one about the pagan rituals). 




 We've been thoroughly exploring more options for almost four years.  But Bredon = Denna's patron was beaten over the reader's head in TWMF. 




 Sounds like someone's feeling irrelevant and wants attention. 




 Denna's patron is Bredon.

Just because it's obvious to us, after years of analysis and the Tor reread, doesn't mean it's not true.  It's probably not particularly obvious to the casual reader.   




 That's USS Alaska (CB-1). 




 ... whew, one letter away from disaster. 




 Pretty much my second favorite Justin Smith play of all time, after the strip in Philly. 




 While that was an awesome play, Brees actually managed to dump it off to avoid the sack. 




 I suspect there are two reasons:

1.)  The people involved are long past punishment.  Either dead, or no longer in the University.  For example, the frame seems to be about seven or eight years after the WMF narrative.  Sim, Wil, and Fela are no doubt long passed through the University, so can't be hurt by punitive action (there's also the possibility that some or all of them are dead, but I have my reasons for not believing this is true).  Riem's no doubt long retired, or he turned on Kvothe and deserves to be ratted out.  Elodin's pretty unlikely to give a damn about the other Masters' opinion, and they may even be amused that he burned Hemme's rooms.  Auri very likely has moved on, with her story having a conclusion that the world should be told about.  And what else has he told that really matters?

Also, keep in mind that he hasn't really given anything away about the Ademre that an astute observer couldn't figure out for themselves.  He doesn't really actually describe how they fight, and even if he did, what could you learn from words on paper that compares to years and years of excruciating, devoted training?  If anything, he enhances their reputation, by explaining that for all his talent and reputation, he barely studied amongst them, and barely touched on their abilities.

2.) There may be some secrets he just doesn't give a damn about giving away.  The Maer's arcanist trying to kill him?  Maybe that doesn't deserve to be a protected secret.    The Chandrian need to be told about.  Felurian will never know, and would be flattered anyways.  So ... who is being betrayed?  What secrets don't earn airing?
