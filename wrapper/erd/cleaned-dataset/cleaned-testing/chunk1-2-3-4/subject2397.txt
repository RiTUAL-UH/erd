 Owen libary is my favorite. 6th floor has a great view and usually empty, and the downstairs has the best computers.  Basement of Holland Terrell is also great. or if you like some distraction the first floor of  the CUB is pretty nice

 "I traded it in for  a microphone"

"Yeah I can see that" 




 I'm not the biggest football expert but.. I'm afraid this is a little too true. I think momentum is important for us and Nevada is a school we should be able to beat. Of course if the WSU team that played Rutgers played Nevada I think we would've won. I do however think our home game schedule will be to our advantage since they're against some tough teams but home field advantage will be in our favor. Go Cougs! 




 Not just landfills but the middle of the Pacific Ocean 




 I'm rewatching the show and I just finished Season 7. Over the seasons I think he is one of the most diverse characters  and although it doesn't always make sense I love that he switches persona's each season especially after he gets back from corporate. 




 Don't tell Ayn Rand 




 That's awesome! Now if only the buses were even a little bit on time 



















 I've seen the show too many times so I tend to get seasons mixed up but I'd say for most the show Marshal is a corporate lawyer which according to the show/real life makes a lot of money. Plus Lily has a teacher's salary albeit not great but still. So why are they always seemingly broke? Even if Lily spent her entire paychecks on clothes I don't see how they'd be tight on money, and Marshal's school debt would be bad but I doubt he doesn't have a plan on it. Any thoughts?

 What year in med school are you? I'm hopefully going to pharmacy school next year. Just waitin on that email to come 




 I just hate how throughout the series we're led to believe that the whole gang is always together. Uncle barney and Aunt Robin are always prevalent. But no turns out they all pretty much go their separate ways.

Barney's part too. He just becomes a total loser at the end. Perfect month? I'm sorry but no. And then he has a kid with a random ho whom we know nothing about and everything is fine and dandy. Why have we never heard about this kid before. Wouldn't that kid be Ted's kid's friend? Total shortcut in writing 




 I thought the way it was written was classic himym, definitely not the top 5 worst episodes 




 Anything autism related. I don't even know why that gets discussed on Reddit 




 You may need to explain this further 









 Since when is all of france the size of NYC? 




 That's how I got here. I remember back in 8th grade I had a Coach Z shirt. So awesome 




 I have an actual cat, is that cool? Anyone? 




 That's true but at least Barney doesn't introduce the girls to them. I mean I don't break up with someone then show off the latest person I'm seeing to my ex 




 Ok, thank you for actually coming up with a reason. Of course I wouldn't discriminate against other races. I don't think there's a country in the world where every single person is unattractive  




 Are you trying to make me sad?

 I don't get your logic why is it necessary to be attracted to every single Asian group? I mean if you think Italian girls are hot does that mean you have to love Polish girls too just because they're all European? 




 My parents are putting me through college and I thank them all the time. I mean it literally wouldn't be possible otherwise. Working full time at the same time as college wouldn't be enough, and that would be darn near impossible anyways 




 As a college student I can say there's a direct correlation between time spent studying and grades on tests. However I don't really get hw I just have to memorize tons of stuff 




 How is thinking chinese girls are cute racist? And no one asked you to reply to my post

 Good thing I'm lipid soluble 




 "Look is this gonna happen or what?" 









 The last episode just really made me bitter towards Robin. I feel like she was the reason the divorce happened. Sounded like she only cared about her career and never spent time with Barney 




 I asked this too awhile back. General consensus was that was just Barney joking 




 And now you're into human sandwhiches 20 years later?

 I always wanted Ted or Barney (either one really) to marry Wendy the Waitress. She's one of the best looking girls on the show and looks fun. Maybe I just want to marry her :( 




 This may sound weird but I've always thought smoking in old movies or like this picture looked cool. I don't smoke but damn OP's dad just makes it look awesome. Just that relaxed look

 Yes in fact these 2 motions are analogous to said fingerbanging 




 Did anything cool happen or did you just mail them back? 




 I can just hear those ribs cracking 




 Chucks/vansheels. always 




 My cross country team was an absolute joke. We did far worse stuff than wave, like skipping across the finish line. It was fun though 




 Yep, had this happen to me once. The dude came to my car, opened my door, and yelled at me.  To OP, that is a horrible situation and I hope the guy gets thrown in jail for a good long while 




 Chad's bad 




 I definitely agree. Although I did love Archer Vice. Glad it's goin back to the original format tho 




 I thought it went well. They were pretty casual and only asked about 5 or so questions that were all what I'm sure any pre-pharm person would have answers to.  Then they let me ask questions; I had a notebook of them written down so I just asked away. And they were all super nice 




 Did everyone back then just have thick black hair with perfect hairlines? 




 MC Escher that's actuallly a genius title for this. I'm still confused.. 




 Plus the timeline seems all screwed up. I watched Death Note in like 36 hours and I couldn't believe the plot of the sho was over the span of like 6 years 




 All mine was accurate except math. It went from 73 to like a 63. I was not happy 




 Thanks for the advice everyone. If anyone else has questions about the interview process I could probably answer them after today

 Watch all the cartoons my parents wouldn't let me watch. All those missed Pokemon episodes..

 I'd love to wear a button up and tie on occasion. I feel like I'd look weird though 




 Sorry you have had bad professors. 

I myself am a Senior here at WSU and have mostly taken classes in the Bio/chem departments. I have to say with the exception of my Engl 101 TA every professor I've had has been great. They are all experts in their fields, have been very good with explanations and keeping the class interested, and all their tests have been fair in accordance with the syllabus. Even the difficult classes I wouldn't complain about because they just require more studying.

If you are thinking of coming here, please do.  This is an awesome college with great programs (especially engineering).  Go Cougs! 




 Funny you should mention that. I just failed my first Immunology exam, and I too would agree it's been my hardest class to date 




 Rough wasn't it? Feels great to take that last chemistry class though 




 Could be high school, college, grad school etc. 




 I live where it gets sub freezing for the whole winter. Got one of those 3 in 1 Northface ski jackets and it's one of my best investments. Totally worth it if you plan on using one for years

 There's definitely a group mentalitiy in the workplace. If everyone there is friends with each other and happy then there's less chance they are going to leave.

 You always hear about business owners giving people shit for giving them bad reviews. I don't know what's going on here 




 Not to bust on the show here but after Who Wants to be a Godparent I can't blame him 




 Wow that is a daunting task

You should include a count number for all the scotches Ted and Barney drink

Now that I think about it is Marshal and Lily the only people who don't like scotch?  




 It's always fun when you show up to the date, see she looks nothing like her profile, and instantly know the next 3 hours are going to be awful.

Off Tinder though the girl was actually awesome and we had coffee and sang in the car. Of course, at the end she said she was one month away from actually being 18... 




 Not only that but that's a really famous line. How do you fuck up the order of it 




 Dangus the Mangus 




 Because no one wants to go into the dentists, so you have people who come in already hating you. Then you have a rough schedule to keep between their responsibilities. And people's mouths are gross

 Seriously! In high school I was pretty quiet but people would always ask "are you alright?" Like yeah I'm alright now get out of my business! 




 Last week I finally finished Atlas Shrugged after months of reading it. I'd post my thoughts of it on here but too drunk and too many thoughts of it ha 




 Favorite book from high school.  




 Dude you are on a roll today 




 I like that umbrella part. I've also heard that With Tracy it was already raining, but with Robin Ted had to make it rain 




 That's exactly my point really. He's basing his whole exodus based on a republican be voted in next. Well who knows what the next republican might be like. Maybe he'll change America for the better 




 You do realize there have been more Republican presidents than Democratic ones right?  




 I think 100 million is a little much for this situation. For most people here that'd be over a million per year, and that would already be far more than most of us make. 

But Like other people said set up long term investments 




 That the girl you think is into you is definitely into you 




 Well my one item would have to be the check the lottery people wrote me. Then go back in time say the 40's when I can actually use the check. Of course then my present lottery winnings are worth fortunes more. I then buy the US government, bang the First Lady of the time. Then I'd die fighting in Germany whistling a Charlie Parker tune 




 Math. Which is weird because I can do physics/chem type math but actual math classes I've never been good with. I think it's the lack of application the book's present 




 I've done it a couple times. Met up with this one chick, we smoked and watched a movie. Later we were making out and she wanted to have sex but I didn't go through with it, kindof a weird time for me.

Other time she ended up being like 45 and again I didn't go through with it 




 I just want to work at an independent coffee shop in Seattle and live in a crappy apartment. I'm a senior in college now and think about seriously doing it all the time :/

 Back in 8th grade my friends and I counted down the days til Battlefront 2 came out. Now I've been waiting years 




 The episode that's an entire freakin documentary of Robin Sparkles makes me want to punch somebody.  I mean it was funny at first but I feel like it became more of an inside joke for the actors/writers than to us the audience 




 TIL adenosine=adrenaline from a high school bio student 




 Same here and since Ted says it like 20 times in the episode I figured actually saying bitch each time would be a little ridiculous. I agree though c word makes more sense for reactions 




 I work at walmart and we have chip readers along with the magnetic ones. The chip ones seriously take at least a minute to read (sounds short but not when there's a line). If we're gonna use the chip readers they need to optimize them

 A ball point banana! 




 I wouldn't say Marshal is two dimensional, but sometimes I feel like his personality is all over the place. I feel like they add traits to him for jokes but they don't always make sense for his charaacter 




 Fully agree with the changing thing. They made it sound like their only reason was "we want the kids to look like they're still the same age." Well through some more makeup on them because the Season 9 HIMYM is not Season 2 HIMYM 




 The only food I think of with Wisconsin now is their frozen custard. I wish I could eat that forever 




 How do they get the mail? 




 Grabs spork 




 I felt the same way. I think my biggest complain is they left out not only major characters but the major plot that went with said characters. We miss a lot of the conflict resolution with the film

 So after his face smashes into the steering wheel he thinks hmm that was nothing, guess I'll keep going. Then gets stuck again 




 A paragon!! 




 my 8th grade IMs.. I shudder to think. In high school the girl I always talked to wanted to go back and read them one day but I refused 




 I thought that word died out awhile ago. And I hate people who act like they're making Sperry's cool, as if they haven't been for like 100 years now 




 I've only seen this on the internet and still don't know what it means or how to pronounce it 




 Pumpkin beer is probably my favorite seasonal. The flavor is good but only for a short bit so one month of it is perfect

 This episode has the classic fun fact of Barney previously not knowing how to drive and yet in this episode he has a license. Not only that but what appears to be a rented sports car

Meanwhile Ted is far too nice like always and Stella is a grinch as per usual 




 The episode where Marshal gets dating advise from Barney and fails miserably. They make up at the end though 




 Thank you!!

 Yeahh. Had the show been like 3 seasons it would have been fine because we knew it was just about meeting her. By season 9 though I think us fans wanted to know all about her, not just the shadow. 




 I don't think there could possibly be an answer to this. If you think about it, he would have to be describing everything people are saying and where they are etc. It's sortof the difference between reading a book and then just watching the movie 




 Slap a vest over that crime scene of a tie 




 The douchebags are replaced with crazy people yelling at nothing. One time there was this old dude with his hands raised yelling "THIS! I CREATED ALL THIS!". It was funny though 




 My 3 hour layover in Atlanta was pretty much awful 




 I know right? My family used go on ferry rides from Bremerton just for the views 




 Only club in the Palouse maybe 




 I think it's totally unfair to Halliday what happened to him and I hope he recovers.

But this will be a great oppurtunity. Since this season is more or less over anyways Falk will get some good training in. Then the next 3 years he can continue on building a strong team and Mike Leach can steer him in the right direction 




 Thanksgiving day, in my opinion, is one of the busiest travel days of the year

I just want to punch her 




 Yes, and the stuff she said which everyone claimed to be funny just because she's not they type of girl who would say those things, was just painful to listen to 




 Yeah and that's because he looked like the definition of old school cool

 What's with these?

 I don't know about jail but certain parts of your body would be a little too exposed for the impending plate throwing 




 I love craft beer but there's just those nights when I need me some PBR 




 I don't understand why he had to manipulate votes anyways. He got like no less than 500 points on anything he ever posted plus gold half the time. He said he downvoted info that wasn't correct, but people only paid attention to his posts anyways 




 Same here. They're easy to order, they dont leave you drymouthed like jack and coke, and you look cool 




 This is what always gets me. They're like yeah 1000 will pay my kids school, oh 60? Good thing the casino is right over there 




 I'm a college student who got rid of fb. It's really not that bad, you just have to use email more 




 So that he could once again talk to Tony and get his sweet archaeologist gig 




  If people upvote it, that means it's good content, plain and simple.

The people who upvote are probably the same people who forward emails 




 That may be, but the people commenting =/= the people upvoting. Theres plenty of examples of thousands of upvotes, but the few hundred comments are all negative towards the image. Usually the comment section is people who truly care about the quality of pictures on here 




 They also have soup. 500 50 oz cans of Chicken noodle comin my way 




 Ok wrong word lol. Not something you'll have the rest of your life.  




 You just sit on them and glide around the gym and of course smash into anyone in your path. Of course it ended in one of 2 ways: Your fingers going under the wheel or the thing tipping over also crushing your fingers. 




 Yes, I work at walmart so walking around a lot so when I started working I bought a pair of Nike trainers and they've been amazing. I see my coworkers wearing chuck taylors and can't imagine the horror their feet are going through 




 Seriously. I mean I know everyone has that thing they like to spend their money on but buying coffee however many times a week is an astronomical amount of money on something that's not even tangible 




 Artificial sweetener like Splenda. Probably not the best but look how common it is now 




 I'm not sure what the WUE is but 1) I think if you applied now you would get in and 2) if you wait til December I think that's still plenty of time before the deadline although I don't totally remember

Plus doesn't your application update when your new SAT score comes in? I think it might 




 Keep your eyes out on CL 




 At least 3000. This is the type of thing where you just make a milkshake that's 1000 calories 




 Oh yeah I giggled for like a minute at lacrimal caruncle 




 is it the evidence of abstinence? 




 Initials plus lord helix since I made this when twitch plays pokemon was happening. I guess its just a cultural reference now 




 So should I take tests while hungry as well? 




 Yeah I watched all of Scrubs then someone tried to get me to watch house. House is just a dick minus being funny and I figured every episode was going to be like that. 




 I just think they could have labeled way more things, and way cooler things too 




 That's actually not that bad. Especially in that glass case, looks super nice. Plus all those random things put together some of which aren't exceedingly common. 




 First off this might be long and I don't really expect anyone to read it...

Anyways, first time I read SP was a couple years ago or so and now I'm rereading them for about the 50th time.  And every time I read them I get this "feeling". And I think it's that I sort of relate to Scott in that I tend to elate things in my mind, and I'm also really clueless about girls emotions.  For example, Scott and Kim's relationship how she never stops caring about him. I know I've unintentionally led girls on in the past and I feel like a jerk about it. But by the end of SP we realize that everyone has done things in their past that were bad, or they regret, and it's a nice thought that you can move past that.

I also love the books because I (and I'm sure everyone) goes through the struggles of life (school etc.) and SP sortof has that simple carefree life and it reminds me to just not worry about things as much.

Anyways, those are just a couple reasons why the books are awesome. Maybe other people relate to the books in the same way, but either way thanks for readin 









 Was that a recording of a crappy tv from someones flip phone circa 1996? 




 I've seen girls at my school walkin around in the smallest dresses of all time and heels in the winter on ice 




 I love the hair fwoop even though he doesn't have long hair 




 I know a big thing in their minds seems to be that "you're just not the one" but seriously. Especially when they are already like 35 years old and it seems to me like they have everything except that one spark that it takes.  They do end up going on more date in season 6 (?) and at the end Ted says it's just not going to work. I guess it always just seemed a bit forced that they don't get together 




 I always kindof thought that was off. Doesn't a judge have to be impartial? 




 coh-STANZ-a 




 Hope the cadavers in my anatomy lab appreciate these 




 She also tries to run off to Spain using the money they don't have when Marshal is being an environmental lawyer. Sounds more like something Barney would do 




 He is exactly what you need. No more, no less. 




 The thing about Jar Jar is that I've grown up to hate him. Ewoks are cool though 




 Us plebeians down here can only dream 









 That one girl towards the end just chanting in the dudes face. Such fury 




 That's what I thought it was until the end when everything just went on as is.  Ultimately though I think it was just a way to showcase the actors talents. Either way I thought it was a cool scene 









 Then years later marry the girl who helped him to live 




 I should, totally ruined my night 




 Yeah guess I got ahead of myself there thinkin I was goin for the easy kill 




 It was the best burger in NYC 




 If you're talkin Rogue Squadron there was the AT-ST walker level, the Tatooine race with the T-16, the cadillac, the millenium falcon, naboo starfighter. I love that game 









 Who's Zed? 




 I love Scrubs so much. The difference between JD and Ted is that JD is like hmm I haven't been laid in awhile guess I'll pull the doctor card and pull a hot girl while Ted overthinks everything 




 Technically that would still be 0
