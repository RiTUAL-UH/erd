 Thanks for the answer. One of my goals is to bring the price down for more casual players too, and make it easy to transport.  




 I certainly will, it will be worth 40% of my grade for that course. Apparently, we would be outsourcing the designs to producers, so if I could be able to make several boards, I would love to give you one for free! But I just started designing it, so don't expect it any time soon. 




 Wow, thanks so much for the detailed post!

2) I will post pictures of the designs and specifically tag you to hear your advice.

3) Aluminium just seemed an interesting material to use for white pieces, but I will certainly think of all materials available for me.

4) I hope I will not make them finicky.

5) Yes, I will certainly make them weighted.

6) I will try to add magnets, but will not make it a priority.

7) I didn't think of that, but I will still strive to do it, but I think its not a necessary.

Thanks so much to the post. Another question, how much are you willing to pay for a chess board? 




 Yep. I was thinking of also a way to make the puzzle pieces to click on the other side of the board to keep it together. 




 Thanks so much! That certainly looks nice! I will try to use the puzzle design, as well as making the board look like the "perfect one". 




 Four pawns on one tile? Isn't that a bit too much? Looking at chess boards I own, it seems to much. Is there any reason for your advice? 




 Thanks :) 




 Will do! One more thing, what is the price range you are willing to pay the most for a chess board? Thanks so much mate!
Do you mind if I will be using some of your answers in my project? Just quotations. User tag could be optional. I dont think examiners will care to much.
 




 That is exactly what I was thinking. But it would still be visible, making it less appealing. Trying to think of a way to make it better. 




 That is what I am striving to do! 




 Wow! Looks incredible! I wish everyone in this subreddit could have one. I could answer this question myself, but im interested in what your thoughts are: what makes this board so amazing? 




 Will certainly try! 




 Thanks! Since I am just a beginner, sadly I dont think I will be able to pursue pieces that look beautiful like the first two links. I will try to make wild designs, and will try to make sure they are not terrible. As for all the other links you posted, I will try to do all the suggestions you posted! 




 Wow! Interesting design. Is it practical when playing? 




 Silly me, I thought I read weightLESS pieces. I was also puzzled by the idea of having light pieces. But this makes sense. I am sure your idea is much more favorable. 
However, I was curious about what you think the design of the pieces would be. Is there any style you prefer? For example, do you prefer medieval looking pieces, or maybe more modern? 




 1) What the hell did I just see! Do people actually play on that!?

2) Its true, those colourful boards are plainly a pain. However, why do you want Stauton peices? I was thinking of making newer, more elegant and simple designs (but certainly not abstract pieces where you could not tell the difference between a rook and a bishop).

3) Thanks so much for the advice! You are the real mvp! I can use any material really, and wood certainly is the easiest option, but I really wanted to experiment with "new" materials, such as aluminium? I was not thinking of glass as I imagine it could be easily broken when travelling (saphirre or gorilla glass may be too expensive).

4) Will do! In your opinion, do you think I should?

5) Sounds interesting and aesthetic, but how would that help?

Thank you so much for the detailed post! I didn't expect such a great answer!  




 I agree, those small magnetic boards are impossible to play with! That is why one of my main goals is to make a chess board that would take the least space possible while not used, but explained/unfolded to be easily playable.
Why would you want the pieces to be wooden? What do you think of other materials? 
And finally, what do you mean by mountable from 4 pieces? 
Thank you for the post, and good luck in games! 




 Can you please explain why you would want to see that? Do you want the pieces to be hollow or made out a light material? What materials would you prefer? Thanks for the answer :) 




 PS. Sorry for the strange title, my retard friend submitted the post before I finished writing it. 




 Hey r/chess!
For a school project, I decided to design and produce a chess board (for those who know, Design   Technology course in the International Baccalaureate). I really love chess, and therefore I really want to do a chess board that will be amazing. Do you have any suggestions? Has there every been some aspects you wished you could improve? What materials do you prefer? Designs?
Feel free to tell me if there is anything you would want!


 




 Is it really that bad? I can imagine every country over states what it did (been in both UK and Russian systems, which does point to that). I wish education about WW2 could be less biased towards the home country. I also wonder how the German lessons are about WW2. 




 I fully agree, and what the US did was certainly amazing and important. However, it seems to me that you are stating that what the USSR (and to a certain extent the UK) did was insignificant compared to what the US did. 




 Why? Just interested. 




 Hey r/euro!
I hope this subreddit is alive, I hope this post will kickstart a discussion!
What do you think about the ECB interest rate? Do you think it will change, why, why not? Will it be affected by the QE?
Feel free to share your thoughts! 




 Thats a lot of support to the US, but what about the USSR (and to a certain extent the UK)? 
























 What do the value investors here think about this? I see it too high, but there are some valid arguments. What do you think? 









 Due to the popularity of my post in another subreddit (which I feel is very useful to anyone who invests), I felt like I should share it with r/investing:
http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/2wvd06/the_intelligent_investor_handbook/ 




 Top two in this subreddit! :D 




 It did not, but neither do I. I just tried to find some sort of proxy indicators that try to measure (quantify) the advice Mr. Graham gives.  




 Your welcome!  




 Thanks for the help! Was actually using that, but now I am certain in what I'm doing. Thanks! 




 Great post deserves more than my upvote! 




 Thanks so much for all the comments. I felt like I wanted to add several things. 

1) The sections are not necessarily the most important.
2) The formulaes are there for those who know them, but can be easily researched.

But most importantly:

3) This is meant to be edited and improved by this great community, so that the I.I. handbook becomes even better. If you feel something is wrong, post an edited/improved version. 




 Explain what ORI does as a business please, apart from a one liner from wikipedia. How is it organised, what are its departments, products, services. By doing so, it will help any ORI investors by being more clear. 




 Hey r/investing! 
I was just very curious if you could answer this question. I'm sure many others will be interested. How do you measure/understand a company's "competitive moat"? Would really wish to know.
Thanks in advance! 




 Time will tell ;) 




 Where do you get your stock market news?
Just read news. In the business sections (also economy/finance/etc.) you will see companies performing good/bad. What news should you read? NYT, Economist,WSJ (for high quality), Business Insider, CNN Money (for more casual).
Do you come up with your investing ideas, or do you find inspiration or advice from some place?
Completely depends on different people. 




 Thanks! 
Sure is a moronic question :D 




 Your welcome! :)
I would be very interested! 




 Hey r/investing! :)
A quick one. When are annual reports published in the US? What about europe/asia? Thank you in advance :) 




 Hey there investors.
During my reading of the book (2003 edit), I highlighted some of the main points I felt that were important for me. I then wrote this handbook, which is effectively a list of these quotations ordered to make a bit more sense. I then added my own notes to add/clarify the notes. 

First of all I just felt like sharing it so that it could help any of you. However, I would also love it if you could add upon it (maybe I omissed some importnat things?). Thank you in advance, and hope this helps you! :)

PS. If you didn't read the book, I strongly suggest you do.

Thanks for the upvotes! First time in my life I'm on top of a subreddit. Im very glad its on this one, I really think its the best subreddit out there! 




 Money weekly YouTube channel. You cannot hate it. 




 ESTJ terran.
But what does the "variant" mean? How many are there? Tried looking, couldn't find (I got assertive).
Same thing to what is a sentinel? (Explorer etc) 




 Countries that have defeated an aggressor in war have the right to claim parts of its land, an unwritten rule in war. Germany tried, and failed, to expand its land. The surrounding nations had the right to take their land. Besides, Nazi Germany deserved the punishment it got, and present day Germany, without all this land, is far better off than at any other period. 




 Best country in the africa! 




 Being Russian, I can tell you: Russians drive similar to many other countries (which are similar). Its just Russians have the cameras (they have more footage). 




 For every gif of an epic widow mine shot you see, there's at least 50 fail shots you don't see done by guys like me. :'(
Widow mines are just awesome to watch, that's why they are posted to often.  




 If thats a school, im not. I live in Paris. 




 Wow, thanks. Will ask if the school has a 3D printer. 
























 Why do you say so?  




 Wtf motherland calls ought to be a wonder! 




 Droidippy mate! 




 Thanks, an excellent explanation. For some reason I'm more familiar with the last terms than the first ones :p You're amazing thanks! 




 No one mentioned the intelligent investor? 




 From house of cards, "the anti-nuclear argument is purely emotional, with no rationale or logic supporting it".
I'm paraphrasing. 




 Vive la France! :D 




 Should be similar as to like total war (where different rates of taxation earn you money, but stifle food, science, happiness).
But similarly, economics in civ has always been non-existant. So much more could be added. 




 Could someone please explain what that means? The language is a bit too complicated for a mere mortal like me..  :'( 




 LifeLad 




 Amazing answer, but could you please explain the first paragraph (standard deviation part). Learning it in my math lessons and would love to understand how it links to this situation.  




 "There is risk that our increasingly communist government will confiscate everything in sight. " LOL

 




 Can you explain in more detail please? 




 Holy f*ck what an amazing answer. I only understood like 30% of what you said, but wow, thanks so much! I will dive into all the things you talked about to try and formulate some sort of educates respons, but can you start by telling me what is kurtosis? That ks so much! 




 SL. Thought of going up, but was too late. Get 90%+ in all tests. 




 Hey r/investing!
I have to write a mathematics essay (Math Internal Assessment for the IB), and at the moment I am trying to formulate a question. Since the stock market is very interesting, I was curious, what mathematics is used to "predict" share price movements. Any relatively complex maths is enough, even if it is completely wrong (I assume many mathematics formulaes, etc. in predicting the stock market are wrong). Any help would be helpful! Thanks so much! 




 Just shows the new lows Russia has reached. Being a Russian, it hurts :'( 




 I don't know about most, but nuking is certainly up there :D 




 even to (any country) in "x years" the (country) would look alien in "x years +400). Go an read more about the actual religion and culture the (country) and people dressed and what they did for fun and compare that to (country) during the days of (any leader in year year x). It is a continuation but it changed more that enough to be called a different.

I suggest France as a good country. But can apply to pretty much any country. Not trying to argue here, just pointing out that this argument you put forward can be applied to almost any country. 




 I thought I was going to have an amazing well argued response that will change my view for the better and open up a new world in investing for me. Pity all I got is you seeing HR... :D 




 Please don't down vote, imagine its moronic Monday. Why is this statement bad? Sure, the NIKKEI and others have remained stagnant for long times, but most have increased. Over a life time (I'm 17), isn't that good advice? Sorry for any stupidity, CMV. 




 Thank you so much :) 




 Why can't we be proud of being terran? Its like, if a race wins, it has to be putten down. Terran master race, haters gonna hate. 




 Dat spearman tho 




 Oh my god :O Wrong link :'D
Thanks for pointing it out!
 
























 I agree, but I still wish the roman empire could have been larger. 




 From a post I just saw on here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Somalia_map_states_regions_districts.png 




 It was not failed. After Trajan's death, emperor Hadrian was more concerned in preserving the empire, not expanding it. He decided that Mesopotamia could not be kept, and so voluntarily retreated. Whether the Roman Empire could have held on to that land is mere speculation. 




 The most direct benchmarks are the individual indices. The German Dax 30, French CAC 40, British FTSE 100, Italian FTSE MIB 40, the Spanish IBEX 35. These five economies consist of over half of the EU GDP so can be a good gauge, four of them (excluding the FTSE 100) are in the euro zone. However, due to the German and french economic clout in the euro area, the DAX and CAC 40 could suffice.

There is the Stoxx 50: the fifty largest Eurozone companies; which is maybe something you are looking for. However, it is similar to the Dow Jones Inudstrial Average 30, as there are very few companies.

The S P Europe 350, or the FTSE Europe 300 could also be indices that you are interested. But to be honest, these are not that good. For example, they include Swiss companies, which are neither in the EU nor euro zone.

Overall, of course, its up to you. Make your own judgement. I believe it is best to use the individual indices as the Europe is by no means united enough (hopefully soon) to have a single index. Compare the European economies and you will understand what I mean. But if you insist, try using the Stoxx 50.

Hope this helped, good luck! 




 Regret not being protoss. Wish I didn't have to do much and just macro to get death ball. Zerg actually seems hard, much respect. 




 Thanks! :) 




 I wish the new unit would be an upgrade built in tech lab needing armory. This upgrade would revamp the reaper, so that it becomes useful again in the late game. This would reduce the need of new hotkey, be a barracks unit, and make the reaper useful later in the game.
What the upgrade should do to it, how much it will cost, etc. is not up to a plat player to decide. 




 TIL clouds move 




 Instead of a new unit, why cant we have an upgrade to the reaper. This upgrade would require some later game building (armory?) and would completely transform the reaper into some better unit. This would keep the same amount of hotkeys, and make reapers useful later on in the game. Im no pro, so I dont want to propose how the reaper should change, but Im sure this would be better than simply adding a new unit. 




 Got upvotes, no comments :( 
You're all a bunch of backstabbers! :'( 




 Hey r/nootropics! Any recommended source of nootropics for France (western Europe too I guess)? Is there anything else I should do? Thank you in advance! 




 The grass is so green :O beautiful 









 I heard about NQ group. Where can I find them? 




 It was truly nothing. Just teasing. I was worried of getting banned because it happened to me and others many times, and deliberately did not go far. 




 Quality post :D 




 Dear multiplayer game host,

Why do you ban people?

You were playing as Maya on pangea, and were winning by a wide margin. I was Austria, slowly being surrounded by your cities. I convince everyone to unite against you as you declare war on me, and I fight tooth and nail. I forward expand towards you to defend myself, and I obviously troll you to rustle your jimmies. 
Why did you ban me and everyone else from the game dear host?
What is the point? Why do you even play on multiplayer then? You were far from losing, why dont you accept the challenge? Why do you, dear host, always ban the person who challenges you? Why do you do that? And why do you call me 'noob' right before banning me? If im so bad, why ban me?

So many questions, but the only answer I see is "You have been kicked". Please love me back...

Sincerely,
Everyone else in the game.

PS. In all seriousness, why do hosts even play multiplayer if all they do is ban the first threat they see? Why isnt there some voting where a majority needs to vote for banning a player? 

PSS. Oh and host, please buy BNW, G K is sh*t (no trade roads!?). 




 My favorite: carriers don't need sailing. 




 Why did bbyong all in!? I was so surprised!
He was ahead (economy and army).
Please explain to a mere mortal. (platinum league) 




 What about Egypt :D 




 I completely agree with you, and hoped you were ESTJ :( 




 Estj? 




 I will limit any exposure. This is more of a side investment. However, may you please explain to me why you would want to avoid the sector? 




 Hey r/investing!
So I am interested in the solar energy market for many reasons which you can easily find throughout the internet. I am interested in picking individual stocks (no hate please), but I have no knowledge of any solar company (apart from vague knowledge due to Elon Musk investing in SolarCity).
Therefore, I looked at two solar ETF's, found 6 of their largest holdings each, and wanted to find the biggest companies. This is because, in a emerging industry, I would like only the largest companies. 
Here they are, ranked by their weighting in the ETF's: 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XfbhRl9XYBIgPxbqtpNMo802W5MQ76BPgSZVtj13D-E/edit?usp=sharing

I know many of you here are interested in solar, so I am sure this would help you guys. My question is, why is Hanergy so over valued? Is solar city so overvalued because of Mr. Musk? I would love some brief explanations of why some companies are so overvalued compared to others. 

Thanks so much! And I hope this little chart is helpful! 




 What do you investors think about solar? What about its companies? What about the subsidies (notably from China)?
