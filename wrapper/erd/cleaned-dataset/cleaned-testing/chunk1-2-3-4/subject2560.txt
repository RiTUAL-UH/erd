 Never been able to decide between Vancouver and Toronto. I've visited both from the UK and they seem great.  




 It's not that bad. I mean it's expensive but if you're sharing you'll find somewhere you can afford. Some things in London are really expensive - mainly rent, transport and drinking - but there's so much to do for free. Most museums are free, all the theatres do cheap tickets, there's loads of cheap excellent restaurants, loads of parks, and the whole city is like a bunch of towns, each area has its own character. It takes a while to get used to but pretty much everyone gets hooked on London.  




 If I'm having a bad day I just [have a look at this](http://i.imgur.com/rtN6m.gif) and I'm immediately happier. 









 I'm not sure the focus of the study was particularly useful. Equating scientific literacy with just being able to recite scientific results seems both a little patronising and naive. Someone scientifically 'literate' might not know what role CO2 plays in climate change but might be familiar with the experimental processes that led to knowledge about CO2 and therefore be more willing to trust what scientists say.

tl;dr - How scientifically literate can you be if you know the information about climate change but don't believe it? 




 There's a whole heap of ways that stem cells can be coaxed into turning (or not turning) into different types of cells. This study found that slight modifications can stop them turning into fat cells which could potentially be used to fight obesity - bit.ly/1EN16lm 

(Full disclosure: I work at the university that did this study) 
























 Researchers at QMUL have successfully created electricity-generating solar-cells with chemicals found in the shells of shrimps and other crustaceans for the first time. 



















 If your client doesn't currently have any profile and you don't know the outlets you're trying out reach. I'd suggest targeting one or two developing the story specifically for them and pitching over the phone. As other people have said journalists get hundreds of releases a day and if they don't recognise who a release is from they'll probably not even open it unless the headline suggests it's huge news. If you get picked up in one place and send a release to others it stands a much better chance of the story being repeated elsewhere.  




 I'm pretty sure you don't have to eat them or otherwise ingest them so we should be ok.

 No idea what you're talking about... (Yes, I do) 




  Ravenscroft left the quartet in 1942 to serve as a navigator in the WWII Air Transport Command for special missions over the North Atlantic and Pacific; his courier missions included Bob Hope and Winston Churchill.

 I think you're probably right. The sequestering thing in particular makes a lot of sense.

I guess what I was trying to do was find a way of using the massive interconnectivity we have now that wasn't around when our systems of democracy were developed and find a way of getting citizens more involved at the very VERY bleeding edge of decision making. Without resorting to some kind of messy 'direct democracy by smartphone referendum' thing... 




 I disagree. Obviously a lot of it's nonsense but it can definitely be used to convey information in a new and perhaps more accessible way. Here's a more traditional take on that research btw http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/bees-in-danger-epidemic-of-colony-collapses-is-linked-to-stressed-out-honeybees-10034491.html 




 Don't you run all those risks with a jury as well though? And who's to say a sorority girl's opinion isn't as valid as that of anyone else. I was picturing a fairly small group, perhaps a couple of hundred, serving for a short period of time. They'd be vetted, like a jury, to remove the major security risks or anyone with an obvious bias like racist opinions or who thinks all military action should be avoided all the time.

As for security concerns, there are relatively few leaks from juries as far as I'm aware. I think the average citizen takes these things very seriously.

The justification would be making military and political leaders justify themselves to citizens each time they make a major decision, but without having to make all those decisions publicly and risk security. 




 What makes you say that? 




 That Buzzfeed is based on this study - http://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3427.abstract 

It says that other pressures, like the ones you list, cause deaths in older bees and then younger bees start foraging at a younger age which causes them to die early and creates a negative feedback that collapses the colony. 




 Say the government is considering bombing a particular target. Could there be a group of people, selected in advance, like a jury, who're sent the information and asked to contribute to the discussion and vote like a cabinet or privy council do? What would the benefits, difficulties and risks be?
