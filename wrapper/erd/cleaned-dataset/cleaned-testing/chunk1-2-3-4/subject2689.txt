 This is great, thank you! I am bookmarking this post. Quick question, what the heck is THIS ? A three-prong pair of scissors? Trissors? 




 A fellow Canadian! Yes, you should definitely avoid answering the door if you see some carolers out there. 




 XDDD Oh my gosh. I spent the day Christmas shopping and accidentally answered myself instead of the comment left by /u/I_let_the_dog_out down below. Laughing so hard right now. 




 A fellow Canadian! Yes, you should definitely avoid answering the door if you see some carolers out there. 




 Guys, the t-shirt is CLEARLY going to be haunted as f*ck. 




 I live in Eastern Canada, though I have a feeling distance isn't going to stop these guys. I mean, they did manage to leave my house and make it out of the street within minutes. 




 Funny thing is, I can't read analogue clocks...or roman numerals. The grandfather clock has both on its face. I never know if I'm setting the right time or not. 




 A group of carolers came to my door this evening, and I'm pretty sure at least one of them was dead. I had just gotten out of the shower and was watching re-runs on TV, when I heard the doorbell ring. My heart jumped out of my chest and my first instinct was to run for cover. Call me anti-social, but the sound of the doorbell is one of those things I just cant stand. Whenever I order pizza, I pace back and forth nervously until it arrives. My mind races and I cant focus on anything but the minutes ticking by. I dread the doorbell, and having to answer it. I absolutely dread it with every fiber of my being. My cat, sharing my disapproval, scurried between my legs and fled to my bedroom. I'm not going to lie, there was a big part of me that wished I could hide under my bed with him just so I could avoid having to deal with another living being. In hindsight, maybe I got exactly what I wished for.

 nbsp;

In the past couple of years, there had been a lot of home invasions in my area. To gain access to your house, burglars had taken to dressing up as anything from employees of electric companies, to cops. You wont believe how trusting people are towards those they believe to be in positions of authority. Once inside, the crooks would knock out the homeowner and would steal everything of value. It was a terrible thing: these dicks preyed on the weak and the nave. It wasn't uncommon for them to stoop so low as to attack senior citizens, either. This is why I kept a bat near my door. Now, I confess, it sounds a bit drastic, but its not like I brandished it around and swung it in peoples faces or anything. I kept it out of sight, but within reach. You can never be too careful nowadays. Its not like my cat would be willing to run in and maul an assailant to save me: I needed a bit of protection for my own peace of mind, thats all.

 nbsp;

Just as I reached the entrance, the doorbell rang again, giving me the scare of a lifetime. I jumped several feet in the air and released a high-pitch shriek. Looking through the peephole, I spotted a group of Christmas carolers. I thought it was a little strange that I had not heard them singing at my neighbors door first. Usually, I hear these guys coming from all the way down the street, and I quickly turn off all the lights in the hopes that theyll assume I'm gone and skip my house. Not this time, though. Maybe my neighbors were away, and my house was the first inhabited one these carolers had come across on my street. With a hand reaching towards my bat, I opened the door by a few inches. They didn't even wait for me to say anything, and started chanting a monastic chant. It sounded both beautiful and haunting. There were seven singers, but it sounded like a full choir. The ancient song gave me goose bumps, and I slowly opened the door wider to get a better look. Their voices, coming out of their partially cloaked faces, echoed melodiously in the darkness. I was used to the usual Christmas carols, but these beautiful Gregorian chants made me feel completely at ease.

 nbsp;

Through their somewhat obscured faces, I could see the carolers mouths moving as they inhaled and exhaled pure music. Their songs seemed to pierce me right through my soul. I looked at the carolers, one by one, and examined the features on their faded red and green cloaks. They appeared as ancient as the songs being sung. The clothes were tattered, torn, and dirty. It was impressive: these singers had gone through a lot of trouble to look the part. As my eyes traveled to another singer in the group, I noticed something weird. Though I could distinctively hear a low tone escaping from his lips, his mouth was not moving, He was the tallest of the group, so when I leaned down, I could see the eyes on his bluish face. They were pale and unmoving; they were locked on me, yet the bearded man did not seem to acknowledge my presence. The voices got louder and louder, the splendor of the chants countering the ever-growing fear I felt while looking at the caroler in the back. I dont know what compelled me to do it, but I looked down and started counting their feet. I counted 12 in total, but I could see 7 heads. Something was off.

 nbsp;

The familiar ring of my grandfather clock made me realize Id been standing at the door for over an hour. I gasped and checked my watch to make sure it wasn't a mistake. I had to wind the clock earlier that day, and I know I could have messed it up somehow. There was no mistake: an hour had passed, and I suddenly realized how cold I was. My hands were trembling, my legs were numb, and I could barely move. I looked towards the mirror on my left, and saw that my lips had turned blue. I lifted a hand to tell the carolers to wait for me, shutting the door to prevent more of the winters blistering cold to slide into my house. I started humming their tune, though I've never been much of a singer, so I was rather off-key. From the kitchen pantry, I grabbed canned beans and carrots to donate to whichever charity theyd come from. I could hear the voices fading away one by one. When I opened the door to offer the food, the carolers were gone. There were no traces of them, not even a single footstep in the snow. Still frozen from the inside out, I took a few steps onto the sidewalk and looked down the road: the carolers were nowhere to be seen.

 nbsp;

I know I should be terrified, and I'm not saying I'm not afraid. Its just thatevery time I think about the carolers, their beautiful song echoes in my mind, and I start to feel incredibly calm. All I can say to you now is this: beware of a group of cloaked carolers, because I dont think theyre alive, and I think theyre looking to recruit. I know I didn't make the cut. You might be next. 




 Now that's an ominous-sounding reply, if I ever read one. 




 I know a thing or two about haunted cars. It doesn't end well. 




 Son, theres nothing in the dark that isn't there in the light., my father used to tell me, when he found me screaming in my bed.

 nbsp;

Though I am sure his words were meant to comfort me, my young mind understood a more disturbing implication. My dad wanted me to think that I was as safe in the dark as I was in the light, but it sounded as though I was as vulnerable in the light as I was in the dark. I knew there were monsters in my room, and it terrified me to realize that I could not cast them away with the power of my lamp or the flashlight I kept under my pillow. Turning on the light only meant being able to see the creatures that lurked in the darkness, and that seemed far more horrific. Every night, I trembled in my bed, dreading the day when the monsters would finally decide to turn me into a midnight snack.

 nbsp;

One night, when I was seven, I was woken up by the sound of the phone ringing. I crawled out of bed to eavesdrop on my dad. There was an emergency at work, and he needed to leave urgently. He called my babysitter, who was used to his late-night requests and already knew where to find the spare key. I walked to my window and peered outside in time to catch dad jumping into his van and driving off. His headlights momentarily blinded me, and stripped away what little night vision I had garnered up until then. As I turned towards my bed, I spotted something standing on the other side. I nearly peed myself. Squinting to get a better look, I found that my vision was hindered by a collection of fading bright spots still pulsating in my retinas.

 nbsp;

W-whos there..?, I asked, in a pathetic whimper.

 nbsp;

I reached for my lamp, but became paralysed with fear, remembering my fathers words: theres nothing in the dark that isn't there in the light. It would be pointless to turn on the light. The figure swayed back and forth silently, in an almost hypnotic rhythm. I remember hearing it hissing and making a strange dripping sound. As a row of cars passed in the street, light poured in through my windows. I started to make out the creatures details: its arms were twisted and bony, its hands were a trio of clawed fingers that reminded me of a birds talons, it had three spikes jutting out of each side of its bald head, its eyes glowed like those of a cat in the night, and it wore a loose robe that, as far as I could tell, was made up of light leather with stands of hair attached to it. I had watched enough cowboy and Indian movies to know what a scalp was when I saw one. I wanted to scream and run, but I couldn't move.

 nbsp;

Strangely, the creature did not approach me. Instead, it lurked over my empty bed. Pure luck had bunched the blankets up in such a way as to make it seem like I was still under them. Even as the light faded away, I could see one of the monsters talons slowly reaching towards my blanket. It gripped onto the top and pulled it back, revealing the empty bed. The demonic being stretched its abnormally long neck, peering at the spot where I should have been. It made a series of eerie clicking sounds, just like when you smack your tongue against your palate. When it realized that the bed was empty, it emitted a shrill shriek so loud that I had to cover my ears. I remember that sound so vividly, even to this day. It was like a police siren, but ten times louder and somehow more offensive.

 nbsp;

Lights once again erupted through my window as my babysitter came up the driveway. Her headlights enabled me to see each and every unsettling detail on the creatures horrific face. I could see its sunken, golden eyes, its nostrils sitting in the middle of its nose-less face, and its eerily tiny mouth. The mouth formed a perfect circle about the size of the cap on a water bottle, and was lined with tiny sharp fangs. Some sort of blackish ooze drizzled out of its lipless maw and landed on the bed, soaking into my Ninja Turtles comforter. For some reason, that mouth terrified me more than anything in my life. Just when I thought I could not feel more frightened, it turned its angry head towards me. Its long neck stretched out in my direction, and I thought I was a goner.

 nbsp;

F-Fred Wilkins, 162 Vanier Lane! H-hell be much yummier!, I told it desperately, selling out the jerk that bullied me to save my own skin.

 nbsp;

The creature retracted suddenly and melted between the floorboards. I'm not sure whether it accepted my offering, or if the sound of my front door opening spooked it, but it was gone. I ran out of my room, crying my eyes out. I couldn't tell my babysitter what had happened, but she thankfully understood how frightened I was, and let me sleep in the living room while she watched infomercials on TV. Fred was missing from school the next day, and we were told a few days later that his family up and moved overnight. To this day, I do not know whether that was true or whether it was some sort of cover-up to keep our class from freaking out.

 nbsp;

The creature returned to visit me about once a season. Each time, I gave it another address. Sometimes, it was the address of someone I knew, sometimes it would be random, and I would hope for the best. The monster would disappear and leave me alone until its hunger grew again. I started noticing more and more missing children posters when dad and I went grocery shopping. I felt guilty, but no amount of guilt could win against my fear. Besides, the other kids deserved it, right? If they were so smart, they would have done like me and told the demonic figure to go eat someone else. I tried to reason my guilt away, but in the back of my mind, I knew the truth: the kids on those posters were never coming back.

 nbsp;

The last time I saw the creature, I was eleven years old. The moon was casting an unsettling amount of light into my room. I could feel the beast lingering over me while I hid under the covers. I could hear its shallow breathing and feel my blanket dampening from the black drool coming out of its mouth. It didn't matter how many times I had seen the monster, I never wanted to fully look at it ever again. I closed my eyes tightly, desperately trying to remember an address to give it. I felt its talon gripping my blanket, I heard it make that familiar clicking sound, and I panicked. My mind was a blur and I could not come up with the address Id been rehearsing for weeks, in anticipation of his visit.

 nbsp;

I-if you let me live, you canY-you can have my kids when I grow up! I blurted out.

 nbsp;

The creature paused, as though contemplating the offer. I heard its footsteps as it distanced itself from me, and I slowly pulled the blankets away from my face. It gave me one last look. Its tiny fangs twitched a couple of times. I could have sworn I saw it nod, as it slowly disappeared into the floor.

 nbsp;

***

Honey, theres nothing in the dark that isn't there in the light. I told my daughter last night, when her screams woke me up.

 nbsp;

My daughter said there were monsters in her room. I assured her that there was no such thing as monsters. There is nothing worse than living in fear: I knew that from experience. I reached for her teddy bear, which was sitting dutifully on the shelf, and handed it to her.

 nbsp;

Mr. Scuzzles will protect you., I offered calmly.

 nbsp;

She took the bear and hugged it close as she continued to cry and beg for a nightlight. I refused to get her one. I dont want her to see it when it comes for her. God help me, no one should have to see that thing. 




 Oooh, good job on the story, /u/azaerthes and good job on the narration, /u/LateNightSpooks! I must say, I don't know how you narrators do it. If I tried to narrated anything, my voice would crackle like a teenage boy hitting puberty. It's not pretty.

So to recap: way to go both of you!  




 He got me, too. I was thinking: "Man, what a jerk.", and then I saw who it was. 




 Maybe you filtered out series? 




 Protip: don't try to tell the TSA agents that you were following a clairvoyant's warning. They'll think you're crazy. 




 A few years ago, I worked as a receptionist at a local business dedicated to renting steam cleaner vacuums and providing cleaning services. The business is still open, so I wont give out its name. I was alone one afternoon when I got the most unsettling call of my short-lived career. Here is what happened:

 nbsp;

"Good afternoon. You have reached [BLANK] Steam Cleaning Services and Rentals. Please note that this call may be recorded for training purposes. How may I help you today?", I asked.

 nbsp;

We were actually recording calls in case clients tried to break their contracts. People are typically reluctant to let themselves get recorded if they think its going to bite them in the ass later in court.

 nbsp;

"   Can you get blood    out of carpet?", whispered a man, through heaving breaths.

 nbsp;

Had I not received this inquiry a dozen times before, I would have thought it was highly suspicious. You would be surprised how many people need to get blood out of their carpets. Sure, the callers voice gave me the chills, but I had no reason to be afraid: there were a variety of non-creepy reasons why someone would need blood stains removed. Just a few weeks prior, a young mother stepped on broken glass and accidentally got her crimson juice all over her new rug. These things happen.

 nbsp;

"Yes, sir, we can remove minor blood stains. How much is there to clean?", I asked him, as I turned to my computer and pulled up an order form.

 nbsp;

"Theres  going to be   so much blood.", he answered, sending chills down my spine.

 nbsp;

Unsure of what to make of his response, I decided that I had misheard him. Surely, he just meant it was a large mess. I minimized the order form and looked up our list of affiliates. There are companies specifically designed to clean up things like crime scenes, and we earned a 15% commission on referrals. We couldn't handle a large cleanup job, so I figured I would offer him an alternative.

 nbsp;

"I understand, sir. Unfortunately, we can only tackle small to medium stains. If you like, I can transfer you to one of our partners. Theyll be more than happy to take care of that for you.", I told him cheerfully.

 nbsp;

For five whole minutes, all I heard was the sound of the mans abnormal, asthmatic breathing. It was company policy never to hang up on a customer, so all I could do was wait and play Solitaire while he contemplated his options. My unease grew with every second that ticked by. Finally, I spoke again.

 nbsp;

"Sir? Would you like me to transfer you?", I asked him.

 nbsp;

"no.", he answered. I was relieved to finally hear a voice on the other end. "I need you  ", he finished.

 nbsp;

"Im sorry, sir. As I said beforeits not in our mandate to clean large me-", I began, but he quickly interrupted.

 nbsp;

"Youre going to  lose so much  blood.", he told me, his stoic and hushed tone never faltering.

 nbsp;

To hell with company policy: I hung up without another word. While my heart attempted to leave by body through my throat, I went online and performed a reverse lookup on the callers phone number. I sincerely wished it belonged to one of my coworkers, and that hed been playing a trick on me. It wasn't: there were no known matches. Just as I was finally starting to calm down, I saw my phone blinking. The same number appeared on the caller ID. Against my better judgement, my hand reached for the receiver and I brought it to my ear.

 nbsp;

"Y-yes?", I asked shakily.

 nbsp;

"See   you soon.", he replied.

 nbsp;

I slammed the phone back down and got the hell out of the office, locking up behind me. Once I got home, I called my boss and told him Id fallen ill. The next morning, I came in to work and spotted a couple squad cars in the parking lot. My boss was standing outside the front door, a worried expression on his face. I approached him and asked him what had happened. He told me there had been a break-in.

 nbsp;

"Holy shit. Is everyone all right?! Was anything taken?", I asked, in shock. My boss scratched his head, giving me a perplexed expression.

 nbsp;

"Thats the weird thingthey just smashed your phones recorder, and took one of our old steam vacuums---yknow, the one Marc doodled eyes on?", he told me. 

 nbsp;

My blood froze.

 nbsp;

They never found the criminal. I quit my job a few days later because I didn't feel safe at work. My boss wrote me a pretty good letter of recommendation, and I went on with my life. I probably wouldn't have thought about it again, had I not found the old steam vacuum sitting on my front porch this evening, looking at me with its big cartoonish eyes. I called the cops, but they refused to come. They just told me that leaving junk on someones property wasn't a crime that warranted their attention. But now I know that he knows where I live, and worst of all: judging by the content of the vacuum's tank, he knows how to get blood stains out of carpet now. 




 Its hard to believe that just a week ago, my Christmas tree stood tall and proud in the corner of my living room, bringing me so much joy. Now, I find myself wishing this damn tree had never been brought into my home. What few pine needles remain on it are brown and its trunk is bent over, like an inflexible person reaching for their toes. My ornaments have scattered across the floor, but I dont have the strength to pick them up. I've been feeling really sick these past few days, and its getting worse.

 nbsp;

Last week, I returned from work and found a post-it on my door: Used your shower. Left you a gift. XOXOXO Mom. My parents retired a few years ago and moved to a campground away from the city. It was nice and all, but they didn't have running water in the winter, so they occasionally stopped by to do laundry and to shower. When I opened the door, Rex, my Labrador, greeted me excitedly. I know, I know: its a really stereotypical name. In my defence, I got him when I was 9, and I was all about dinosaurs back then. I still am: I have an awesome T-Rex magnet on my fridge that isn't going anywhere. Rex was surprisingly spry for his old age, and I happily met his demands for attention. Running my hands over his soft black fur, I removed my coat and threw it in the general direction of the nearest hanger. Rex, tail wagging like a metronome on steroids, dragged me to the living room. I smiled as I saw the beautiful Christmas tree my parents had left me. Rex spread out under the tree on a white blanket that had been draped around it, and playfully nibbled at the bottom branches.

 nbsp;

The next day, I put on some holiday music and dug through boxes to find my ornaments. Rex thought hed help me by pulling out random objects and hiding them around my house. There was a sweet scent in the air, like nutmeg mixed with candle wax. I had likely failed to close the lid on one of the Christmas candles. The clumped up sugar in my cupboard was proof of my lazy lid-closing ways. Rex was particularly fond of my new garlands, and helped me unravel them all over the living room floor. It took me fifteen minutes to undo all the knots. He loved watching me struggle. After finding a nice array of older ornaments from my childhood and newer ones Id bought myself after moving out, I began decorating the tree. I remembered the year when I got Rex: he was sitting under the tree on Christmas Eve, wearing a big red bow. Wed been friends ever since. As I continued to hang ornaments, I spotted a few yellowing pine needles. I carefully plucked them off and tossed them in the garbage. Their absence did not take away from the trees splendor.

 nbsp;

After a while, I noticed Rex wasn't by my side any more. I looked around my house and found him curled up on his doggy bed, which was pretty unusual in and of itself. Id only seen him sleep there twice since Id bought the thing. Rex much preferred the foot of my bed. All tuckered out, huh, boy? I teased, scratching him behind the ear. He whined lowly and closed his eyes. I let him be, took a few moments to send my parents a thank-you email with a photo of the decked-out tree, and then started on supper. Before sitting down at the table, I opened a can of Rexs favorite food and poured it in his bowl. I called for him, but he didn't come. He was probably exhausted from the decora-thon. I ate alone for the first time in years. The silence was deafening, but at least I could enjoy the view as I devoured my meal: my tree looked beautiful. I checked on Rex a few times that evening, but he was fast asleep. Lazy bum. My dad answered my email and told me they were cancelling our plans for supper the next day because theyd come down with the flu. I gave them strict instructions to get some rest, and then followed my own advice. I was starting to feel rather worn out myself.

 nbsp;

Over the course of the following days, I saw a steady decline in old Rexs health. I was afraid it was his time. I dreaded it so much that it gave me nightmares. I could barely keep myself from tearing up at work. Wed been through so much together, Rex and I. I wasn't ready to say goodbye. I came home one night to find a collection of yellow and brownish pin needles under the tree. It was starting to thin out, like the top of a middle-aged mans head. I vacuumed the mess, feeling really guilty for being unable to keep the damn tree alive. It was a gift, after all. What would my parents say if they saw it in such a pitiful condition? I stopped in my tracks and realized Id forgotten to greet Rex. I ran to his side and dropped to my knees. I didn't even have to touch him to know he was gone. My lips quivering and my eyes dripping, I gave him a final hug. I'm sorry I wasn't here to say goodbye I murmured. I had to call a friend to take care of him. I couldn't do it myself.

 nbsp;

The next few days passed in a blur. I was so distraught that I called in sick from work. It wasn't a complete lie, since I felt like I had caught what was ailing my parents. I emailed my dad to tell him about Rex. He loved that dog almost as much as I did. He liked to kidnap him for week-long camping trips. He claimed we had shared custody of him. Though my parents laptops were typically at arms reach, I didn't get a reply. Dad was probably moping around the campfire and needed his space. I coped by turning into a complete hermit, leaving the house only once to take out the trash and overflowing recycling bin. I cant remember why the recycling bin was so fullI dont recall putting much stuff into it. Meanwhile, my Christmas tree continued to decay. I was too much of a wreck and too worn-down to bother taking it out to the dumpster. I let it rot slowly in my living room.

 nbsp;

Since yesterday, I've been getting these awful headaches, and my nose keeps bleeding. I spent most of my time lying in bed or sitting at my computer. I wish Rex was here. I wish my parents would reply to my emails. I'm so lonely. I called the friend who took care of Rex for me, but she couldn't stay on the phone very long: seems like I gave her my flu. I wish I wasn't looking at my pathetic excuse for a Christmas tree. Its slouched over and there is not a single ornament left on it. Ugh, the screens getting all blurry, I'm probably going to go to bed soon.

 nbsp;

As I was typing this, I heard a faint hissing sound coming from the tree. I lethargically wheeled my chair over and leaned in to listen. It was like the sound of air escaping a tire, and it was coming from a tiny black tube sticking out of the trunk. Thats when I realized something: the tree had no scent. I should have been able to smell pine or rot or something. Anything. Then, I remembered why the recycling bin had been so full. My mind was distracted when I took it out, but it was coming back to me. There had been a large crumpled-up cardboard box with the picture of a tree on it.

 nbsp;

Artificial Christmas trees aren't supposed to die

 nbsp;

Oh man, I'm starting to feel really dizzyI'm going to go lie down for a while 




 Time to get those pesky braces moved. Ask your orthodontist to tune them in to the station of your choice. 




 I totally agree. As a writer, I get a lot of entertainment from reading the comments and seeing people's theories. Some of the ones they come up with are absolutely awesome. Sometimes, I find myself thinking: "Man, I wish I thought of that." There's no need to over-explain your ending. Just make sure you drop a few hints in your narrative, and then sit back and watch what happens. 




 I would have to agree with what everyone is saying: good title, captivating story, shocking ending, etc. I also think there's a bit of luck and a bit of strategy that goes into it. Personally, I try to post when I see that a lot of people are online but not a lot of stories have been submitted, in the hopes that mine will start off as close to the main page as possible. Then I just keep hitting refresh while quietly sobbing and rocking myself in the corner, hoping that it'll get some upvotes. Then, of course, there's the goat sacrifice...but everyone knows that.

I've also noticed that longer stories get less love. 




 Someone PLEASE make this story happen. Then, as a crazy twist-ending, you find out it's actually a site full of people making gourmet food out of those Easter marshmellowy peeps...
...
...FROM HELL. 




 I wasn't expecting that ending. 




 Something horrible is going to happen, and I need to stop it before its too late. I'm not sure what I can do, except to warn as many people as I can. Please heed this warning if you signed up for the North American MP3 Flash Mob on December 24th, know someone who has, or intend on going shopping that day.

 nbsp;

A week ago, my friend came across a website preparing one of those MP3 flash mobs, just like the ones ImprovEverywhere does. You know, where they give people an mp3 file with pre-recorded instructions, and then let them loose in the community while onlookers gawk in disbelief. I used to watch those videos, but they got old after a while. In any case, the organizers of the flash mob my buddy discovered were trying to break the world record for most participants by spreading the activity across all of North America, and my friend wanted me to join him. I wasn't too keen on doing it, but I owed him one after the bungee jumping fiasco of 09. I went to the address my friend had given me (MP3flashmob.com) to sign up. There were pre-determined meeting spots in malls in every major city. Great. I was going to have to make a fool of myself in a frantic crowd of last-minute Christmas shoppers. After selecting my city from their list, the website brought me to a download page. There were strict instructions NOT to listen to the MP3 until 1:30 p.m. eastern time on December 24th, so that the activity would be as much of a surprise to those witnessing the flash mod, as it would be to those participating.

 nbsp;

After coming home form work this afternoon, I got a little curious. I knew I wasn't supposed to listen to the audio file, but its a damn good thing that I did. I slipped headphones into my ears and pressed PLAY. A bit of Christmas music started playing in the background as the hostess began: Welcome to the North American MP3 Flash Mob experiment! Thank you for participating in todays flash mob. Together, well make history! she said, in a cheery tone of voice. I noticed a very faint hum in the background. It was just outside my hearing and didn't bother me too much, but it was constant and unwavering. I figured it was coming from a piece of equipment in the persons recording studio. My brain soon adjusted to the sound and started drowning it out. Please take a seat. We will begin shortly. chimed the hostess. I sat on my couch and waited for three whole minutes while an elevator-music rendition of Jingle Bells played in my ears.

 nbsp;

Finally, the hostess began relaying simple instructions: raise a hand, look at a stranger, freeze, unfreeze, walk a few paces northwest, etc. They were all fairly harmless things, and even though Id only intended to listen to the MP3, I played along and did everything she requested. Then, she asked me to do the most horrendous thing I could think of: Turn South and dance the Macarena. she insisted, her tone slightly forceful. I was mortified. I was going to have to do this in PUBLIC! Before I even knew what was happening, I realized I was dancing that evil, disgusting, out-dated dance alone in my living room. It was as though my body had automatically reacted to her command. Mind you, I did the most half-assed version of the dance, but I did it none the less. Fortunately, she soon went back to giving me menial tasks. Little did I know; however, things were going to get worse.

 nbsp;

The hostess voice became more and more authoritative with every order, and the constant hum in the background got louder as the MP3 went on. I felt a fog rolling over my mind. I dont know if you've ever passed out before, but if you havent, theres this weird sensation just before it happens. Its like youre walking on clouds, and you cant quite feel your body any more. I've felt that sensation a few times before when my blood pressure dropped so low that I blacked out. Thats exactly how I felt listening to the MP3, minus the part where I wind up face-first on the carpet. I did everything the hostess asked of me: I lifted my hands to the sky, I threw myself onto the floor, and I wiggled around like a worm. I couldn't stop myself even if I wanted to. I was thankful Id closed the curtains in the living room before I started. Had anyone seen me, I think I would have died from embarrassment.

 nbsp;

It was then that the instructions took a more unsettling twist. Nowfind or buy a sharp object. said the woman, pausing for a couple of minutes so I could comply. I walked into my kitchen and grabbed a knife from the drawer. Find somebody wearing a red shirt. Approach them slowly from behind. she told me. I looked around, but I was alone. My inability to follow-through with her command made her control over me waver. Plunge the knife into his or her back. she instructed, her voice dry and firm. Reality dawned on me and I completely froze. The veil lifted from my mind. I looked at my phone in disbelief, and at the knife in my hands. I just barely heard the hostess asking me to carve out the persons heart, when I pulled the cord, popping the headphones out of my ears. Panting heavily, I dropped the knife onto the countertop and backed up against the wall in shock. Thank god I snapped out of it when I did, because my girlfriend came home a few minutes later, and she was wearing a bright red top.

In the hours since, I deleted the audio file, for fear of someone accidentally listening to it. I tried going back to the website to see who was running the flash mob, but the site is gone. I know I'm not the only one who downloaded the MP3. There were thousands of people already signed up for the flash mob when I first visited the website. There were message boards full of users trying to create groups in their cities. I have to stop them, but what can I do? If any of you signed up for a flash mob on December 24th, please PLEASE  please delete the audio file without listening to it. For everyone elsespread the word, be careful, and, for your own safety, dont wear red on Christmas Eve. 




 Aunt Caroline is pretty much the master hide-and-seeker. I mean, she stayed hidden for years after your game! 




 Oooooh, now that is creepy.

Maybe you should check your previous paintings for clues? 




 Really? Sweet, I did not know that. Thank you for your help! 




 I was actually wondering the same thing, so thank you and /u/coraal for answering. On the same token...what if you did not originally mean for the story to be a series, but decided afterwards to add an update? 

Most of my stories are self-contained, but there is one in particular that lends itself well to a continuation, and I think I might go for it. It's too late to label the first one as part of a series...so do I just go for it, add (Update) and put the flair on the second one, even though the first doesn't have that? 




 Damn, what's going to happen to that poor cat? Judy didn't have time to donate to a shelter. 




 Based on photos I saw of her later, I would say no. She looks like my dad and Uncle Steve...if they were women. 




 You're exactly right. It's 50% of the 0.5% that holds family markers.
Edit: Err, in this case, he had 0.09% of the 0.5% that holds family markers. Siblings should have 50% of that 0.5%. 




 It's so weird having people call her my 'aunt', since I didn't even know she'd existed up until a few years ago. Yes, I think I'll snoop around. Not sure if I can get the finger, though. Dad's a little protective of his dolls...wow, that sounded better in my head. 




 It's a given that fourth cousins aren't real people. Otherwise, they'd be first cousins.

But, no. I think I just explained it badly. All humans share 99.5% of their DNA, and the 0.5% left shows family connections. Of the remaining 0.5%, Siblings match 50%, and so on and so forth. 




 It wasn't my mom's hair color, that's for sure. And, yeah, that's one of the things that bothered me, too. I'm starting to wonder if my grandfather was involved. He's the one who insisted they cremate Jessiewas he trying to hide something? 




 It could be! 




 Way to go, you creeped me out! Glad it was just the show.Waitare there typically breathing sounds on TV? Better check the closet


Yes, I will update if I find out anything more. I think it's about time I give old grandma a visit.
 




 If my research leads me to anything, I will definitely keep ya'll posted. 




 I don't think so. I saw a photo of her a little while ago. There's definitely a family resemblance. 




 The finger was in the smallest doll. 




 Does it give you the WET willies?

...

(Sorry dad, if you ever read this. Humor is my coping mechanism for stressful situations.) 




 No worries. I should have included her age. Hmm...I'm not sure whether or not I'll tell my dad. I think it brings him a lot of comfort to have her close to him like that. He might not take the truth very well. 




 Jessie was driving. She was a lot older than my dad. I don't know whose finger it is. I only got the results of the DNA test today, and all it could tell me was whether or not the finger's DNA matched my dad's. 




 Throughout my childhood, I wondered what was in the box my father kept on the mantel. Hed given my sister and I clear instructions never to touch it, in a tone of voice so authoritative that we dared not give in to our curiosity. Our only clue was a small label on its side that read Russian Nesting Dolls. Since none of the boxes in the house were properly labeled, we werent sure what to make of it. I only discovered the truth one night several years ago, when my father and I were sharing drinks and watching a hockey game. I confess: I was not expecting what he told me and showed me that night. I think that, had it not been for the half-dozen Molsons hed downed that evening, he would never have opened the box in front of me. My dad pushed his recliner back, a bottle in his hand, and watched the Zamboni make its way onto the ice. With a quiet sip, he began telling me the story.

 nbsp;

Much to my surprise, he revealed that he had an older sister, Jessie. Up until then, I thought Uncle Steve was his only sibling. When my dad was seven years old, Jessie got into a car accident after a night on the town. Automobile versus tree, and the tree won by a landslide. The damage was so severe that Jessie needed a closed casket funeral. Dads old man insisted they cremate her body. Once dad had gotten a little older, his mother revealed more details about the accident: a branch had taken Jessies head nearly entirely off her shoulders, and her body had been crushed and twisted at unnatural angles. Some of the rescue workers on scene, seasoned professionals used to blood and gore, quit their jobs after that night. As my father spoke, he pushed himself off the couch and walked over to the box on the mantel. I asked if her ashes were inside, but he shook his head. He brought the box over to the sofa, took a seat, and ran his hand delicately against its grainy surface.

 nbsp;

After a slight moment of hesitation, my father pushed open the small wooden slab at the front of the box, revealing a Russian Nesting Doll tucked neatly in a bed of straw. He told me the box had come in the mail exactly ten years to the day after his sisters death. There was no postmark or return address. He turned the slab over to expose a sentence written in red ink: I will always be with you. it read. The name Jessie had been signed underneath and the dot on the i" had been replaced with a heart. Dad insisted it was her handwriting, and tears welled up in his eyes as he gently grazed the now faded markings with the tips of his fingers. I had never seen my dad get so emotional before. It was a little uncomfortable. I took a sip of beer and leaned closer, examining the doll in the box. It was painted like any typical Russian Nesting Doll: a beautiful young womans smiling face, a floral shawl around her neck, small arms at her sides, a rose on her stomach, and a red base. My father followed my gaze to the doll and sighed. The game came back on, and he set the conversation aside to watch, his stern face locked on the screen.

 nbsp;

Holding my tongue until the break between the 2nd and 3rd periods, I barely paid attention to the television. From the disapproving groans being emitted by my dad, I could tell our team was losing again. As soon as the 2nd period ended, I turned to my father and asked him why he never put the dolls out on display. He said he would show me why; if I was man enough to handle it. I puffed my chest in an exaggerated manner and snarled Nurgh. Guh! ME MAN! in a caveman-esque voice. He clutched the doll and pried it open, pulling out the smaller one inside. She was creepier than the first, but still looked fairly normal. She had all the same features, except for two things: she was frowning and the rose on her stomach was black. Noticing the unimpressed look on my face, he popped the second doll open. The third doll filled me with a sense of unease. Its face seemed more demonic, and small fangs protruded from its painted lips. A thorny vine had replaced the rose on its belly, and her clawed fingers gave her a monstrous appearance. OK, I was beginning to understand why he never showed these off. My father cringed, not wanting to reveal the next doll, so I offered him another beer to soothe his nerves.

 nbsp;

A few minutes passed in silence before my father freed the fourth figure. This one really stunned me. It had devilish horns and an angry face. It looked evil. I could feel a weird pressure in my chest. Maybe it was my imagination, but I felt like it was getting harder to breathe. The doll had thick eyebrows, soulless eyes, and a goatee. Instead of a shawl around its neck, it had barbed wire. Its long, bony and clawed fingers were holding the severed head of the first doll in the series. Just looking at it made my skin crawl. God damn, there was something seriously wrong about it. My father downed the beer in his hands and slipped it between his knees. He plucked the doll open and showed me the fifth and final one. It was a little girl with a tormented face. She had blood dripping all around her neck. Her base was painted to look like flames. Of all the dolls, that one scared me the most. I could practically hear anguished screams coming out of her wide-open mouth. Chills ran up and down my spine as I took it in. If I wasnt freaked out enough already, my father said something that ensured I would not sleep that night: Looks just like Jessie.

 nbsp;

The array of dolls disturbed me greatly, and I cursed my innate curiosity. It was then that I noticed a crease in the middle of the smallest doll. Against my better judgment, I asked my father if there was another doll inside. He shook his head. His pained lips turned into a light, almost mournful smile. He carefully opened the lid, revealing something wrapped in a yellowish newspaper tied together with twine. He slowly started to undo the knot, and my heart raced faster and faster with each passing second. I wish I could un-see what I saw that night. I knew what it was before my eyes even caught a glimpse of it. It was as though my brain had filled in the blank all on its own. Inside the newspaper was a shriveled human finger. It had been ripped off at its base, and a broken metacarpal bone stuck out of the old-raisin-like flesh dangling at the bottom. I brought a hand to my mouth and bolted towards the washroom, expulsing beer and peanuts into the porcelain throne. Why had he kept it?! What if my sister and I had seen it? What if it had fallen from the mantel and opened somehow? Did mom know? Was it even LEGAL to keep human remains? Between the gurgles and flushes, I heard my dad snapping the dolls shut one by one. He moved the box to his room the next morning. I never confronted him about it.

 nbsp;

One little detail kept nagging at me, and though I tried to forget about the whole thing, I couldnt get my mind off of it. How had his sister sent him her finger after she passed away? Maybe my grandmother had found the box in the garage one night and left it out for dad without checking its contents, but then, how had the finger gotten inside? I needed to know. Earlier this year, I was watering my parents plants while they were away on vacation, when I saw the box on dads bedside table. I took it home and ordered a DNA testing kit. Along with a few pieces of my dads hair, taken from his comb, I sent a piece of the finger to the lab. Id forgotten all about it until today. Its not like on TV: it can take months to get results. Just so you know, all humans share about 99.5% of their DNA. The remaining 0.5% contains family markers, so to speak. Though there are exceptions, the DNA between siblings usually matches up at around 50%, as opposed to, say, fourth cousins, who match up at 0.20%. Which is to say, when I received the results in the mail today and they came back at a mere 0.09% match, I knew the finger did not belong to his sister. 




 Last week, I saw a ghost. I was walking home one evening, admiring the Christmas lights hanging in a residential neighborhood, when I spotted a girl standing in a courtyard, holding a weakly lit match between her trembling fingers. She was barely visible, but I could make out the outline of her body, her flowing white dress, and her long dark hair. Judging by her height, and what little I could make of her, I would say she must have been about 9 years of age. Her features were blurred, like looking through a fog-coated car window, which gave her face the impression of being entirely smooth. She was hunched over, as though trying to warm herself up. Now, you would think that I would have been afraid, that I would have shrieked at the top of my lungs and gone running in the other direction, snot and tears flowing freely from the orifices of my face. The thing is, it was not the first time I had seen a ghostly apparition, and I learned over the years that it was best not to meddle or call attention to oneself. I stood there and watched her, neither moving away nor closer, until the flame on her match died out and she disappeared.
 
 nbsp;

The next day, despite the tight deadline under which I was working, my mind kept wandering back to the girl in the courtyard. She reminded me of The Little Match Girl from the old folk tale, though perhaps that was because the holidays were around the corner. As I inputted a few figures in my spreadsheet, my thoughts drifted to the first time I had seen a spirit. I was 7 years old, alone in the playground near my house. I swayed on the swings, imagining I was Spider-man slinging my way through the city. At some point, I got tired and stopped putting effort into moving the swing, yet I maintained the same speed and velocity for several minutes. I eventually turned my head around and saw an old woman pushing my seat every time it came within reach. I was too young to ask questions and enjoyed the free ride, until a rumbling in my belly reminded me I had to go home for supper. Sorry. I need to get off. I told her, my tone polite and respectful. She neither replied, nor stopped pushing me. Thanks mam, but I have to go home. I tried to explain, but she continued. Try as I might, I could not get her attention. I jumped off the swing with the next push and landed skillfully on my feet, turning around so I could thank her properly, but she was gone.

 nbsp;
 
Having spent most of my shift reliving old memories, I decided to stay late to make up for my uncompleted work. The sun had set by the time I got out of the office, and snow spiralled to the ground, glistening like stardust in the streetlights cone-shaped beams. I zipped my coat and tightened my scarf. My breath moistened the fabric and a small forest of icicles appeared over the blue fleece. Out of curiosity, I made my way to the same residential area I had visited the night before, wanting to see if the little girl would appear again. Sure enough, her ghostly figure stood in the yard. I could see her more clearly this time. Not only was she more opaque, but her features were also better defined: I could make out the curb of a nose, slight indents where eye sockets should have been, and folds in her dress. The Little Match Girl sobbed quietly, the sound was soft yet it had an otherworldly quality to it. Although I knew she was the source of the cries, the sound seemed to emerge from all around. Her tiny hands shivered as they clutched the match, and her bare feet dug into the snowy ground. Keeping a safe distance, I observed her while the flame slowly went out, taking her with it.
 
 nbsp;

Exhausted and freezing cold, I slipped into the shower as soon as I got home. I thought about one of my other experiences with the supernatural. I was in the midst of a full teenage rebellion; I had taken to wearing spiky leather bracelets and listening to shitty punk-rock bands. I was through with authority and made damn sure everyone knew: adults were stupid, the system was corrupt, and anarchy ruled. I did not even know what anarchy meant, but I wore its red logo proudly and scrawled it on the bathroom walls, like an idiot. My grades started slipping, and I was forced to stay after school with a tutor. As an ex-member of the student council, I was accustomed to wandering my schools empty hallways at night. I was on my way upstairs to get something from my locker when I heard my name being called in a low, moaning voice. A word of advice: if you ever hear someone whispering your name when you know you are alone, do NOT turn around. I spun on my heels, and what I saw chilled me to the bone. It was Samantha, a classmate who had drowned that summer at her familys cottage. She was blue and her bloated arms stretched out towards me. I screamed and, in my panic, lost my footing. The janitor found me passed out at the foot of the stairs. I spent the rest of the semester in a cast.

 nbsp;
 
Christmas music blared from my co-workers radio the next morning. I groaned and ducked behind my cubicle wall, desperately hoping the thin separators would drown out the noise. Alas, there was no escape from my overzealous compatriots tunes. I am no Grinch: not a single living mortal can handle eight hours of non-stop Christmas hits for an entire month. With every jingle bell, I felt my holiday cheer slowly being sucked out of me. I was so happy when the music stopped, that I failed to realize how late it was. Once I finally saw the clock, I hurriedly grabbed my things and headed out the door, locking up behind me. I walked quickly towards the Little Match Girls house, hoping I was not too late. I was convinced I would see her again. I could hear her sobs all the way down the street this time. I planted myself on the same spot from which I starred the two previous nights, and watched. The flame on her match seemed brighter than ever, and it illuminated her features perfectly. I could see tears rolling down her soft white cheeks. Her ornate lace dress blew gently in the breeze. Her silky hair was tangled like the worlds worst case of bed head. Her lips were pursed in a permanent frown, while her closed eyes squeezed more and more droplets onto her gown. She looked cold, and my heart broke for her. There was nothing I could do but offer her an audience until the light of her match fizzled away.

 nbsp;
 
I made my way back home, buying a pre-cooked chicken and a loaf of bread from the grocery store around the corner. I ate while idly browsing the web. I thought about another strange occurrence in my past. I was in my early 20s, walking across a bridge when I saw a shadow on the ground to my right. I figured someone was walking behind me. When I checked, I realized I was alone. The shadow matched my pace perfectly, but its form was completely different from my own. The sun was setting, and it was just bright enough for shadows to stretch out for meters, but dark enough for the street lights to be on. Since I was alone, I assumed two beams of light had caught me from different angles. When a second shadow appeared on my left, I got a little nervous. I waved my hand, hoping to see the motion repeated by both strange shadows, but to my horror, they did not react. I walked faster, the shadows following suit. A third shadow crept up in front of me, and I jumped into the street, bolting towards the end of the bridge as fast as my feet could take me. I did not stop running until I was off the bridge. I turned around and saw the trio rise from the ground and form a odd, disproportionate humanoid shape. It extended its arm and set its hand against the railing, squeezing it as though to show its might. The thick metal buckled under the pressure. As soon as I had caught my breath, I started running again. I was afraid it would pursue me, but it stayed on the bridge.

 nbsp;

After a nights rest, I crawled out of bed and got ready for work. I could feel a flu coming on, but getting the project done was more important than my health. Forehead burning and nose running, I forced my way to the office and slumped down on the computer chair. I did not have the energy to take the long walk home that took me by the Little Match Girls house, so I chose a faster route. Snow crunched and crackled beneath my worn boots as I walked down the street. I was running out of steam and sat on a bench to regain my strength. I looked up at the dark night sky, hearing the distant sound of a girls giggles. This might sound silly, but I saw a shooting star, and it gave me enough pep in my step to finish the journey home. I went straight to bed and thought about the child that had gone missing from my park all those years ago, and how no one had found any trace of him since. I thought about the freshmen that had fallen down the stairs and broken his neck a week after I had fallen in that same stairwell. High school officials claimed he had tripped on a crack in the stairs. Finally, I thought about the young woman and her baby, which had been hit head-on by a car that had slipped on the icy bridge the day after I had been chased by shadows. They had been crushed against the railing, right where the shadow stood watching me. None of these victims knew what I learned over the years: its best not to meddle or call attention to oneself. It never ends well.

 nbsp;
 
Reporters covered the story the next morning on the news. The house where I had seen the Little Match Girl had caught fire and burned down in the evening. No survivors. Yesterday, I saw the vague outline of the Little Match Girl standing outside another house across town. Maybe I should warn the owners, but, as I said, its best not to meddle: I dont want to be the next victim. 




 Oh man, that last paragraph was pretty much the epitome of creepy. You definitely shouldn't go back to that mall. EVER. 




 As I read this, I kept thinking to myself "DON'T LOOK INSIDE!", expecting there to be some hideous creature or mega-pervert looking back at you. This was NOT what I expected, and somehow, it is so much more disturbing. I have chills just thinking about it. 




 I put a few updates at the bottom of the post. I haven't been able to figure out who Ryan is (or was). No Deacon, either. Just...weird stuff going on in my home. Missing objects, weird shadows. I think I've just gotten hyper-sensitized to the weirdness now. 




 Congrats you guys, well earned. : ) 




 Oh...
*Puts his exacto knife away.* 




 Maybe you're about to become the brand new Shelly. The old one was getting a little too old. 




 Maybe you're phasing in and out of a parallel universe? Sometimes, you only know because of little things...like a statue facing the wrong way, or a piece of jewellery being made of a different material...and sometimes, it's bigger things like an entire office full of workers disappearing. 




 Lily's pushing Daisies. 




 This made me giggle to the point that my cat looked at me like I was crazy. 




 I would like to submit [Recently Opened Documents](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2mpxkf/recently_opened_documents/) to the contest. Thank you. 




 Facial features not recognized. chimed a womans monotone voice. I cursed beneath my breath. This laptop had been lying in my apartment for days now, and I still couldnt get it unlocked. My attempts at reinstalling the operating system were met with complete failure. Now, Im no crook, but when I saw this fancy piece of equipment left unguarded on a patio table in some strangers yard a couple of days ago, I couldnt keep my hands from snatching it and dropping it into my backpack. Anyone rich enough to afford a laptop with such advanced security features, and smug enough to leave it unattended, is rich enough to replace it. It was time to take matters into my own hands. But, if only Id known what a huge mistake I was about to make, I would never have taken the laptop in the first place.

It started off innocently enough. Once evening, I returned to the house where I found the laptop and casually glanced through the window from the sidewalk. A beautiful young brunette with a tight yoga body paraded about in the living room. I needed to know her name: I wanted to look her up online so I could get a photo to unlock the laptop. The next morning, I waited a few houses down for her to leave for work. She never even noticed my car tailing hers all the way to a parking lot outside a government agency building. She parked under a maple tree and smiled a beautiful smile that brought butterflies to my stomach. I ducked behind my dashboard as she exited her car and slammed the door shut with an audible THUD. As she made her way to the building, I began to feel a twinge of regret. This was weird, right? Here I was, stalking a perfect stranger so I could break into her laptop. I felt like the scum of the universe. I turned the car around and went home.

That night, I sat in front of the sealed laptop, drumming my fingertips nervously against its cover. I wondered what kind of stuff she had stored on its hardrive. Naked pictures of herself, perhaps? I pushed the damn thing away, but curiosity boiled within me. What was so important that it required this kind of security measure? I groaned and reached into my trusty candy bowl for a handful of goodies. It was an elegant glass bowl Id inherited from my grandmother. It was thick and nearly unbreakable: Id knocked it down many times during my childhood and it didnt have so much as a scratch on it. I poured myself a drink to clear my thoughts, and watched the night slowly drift away.

By the first rays of light, I had convinced myself to try again. This time, I drove to Mrs. Nicebuns workplace and waited near the entrance. I sat down on a bench with a cup of coffee in one hand and a newspaper in the other. When she finally showed up, I accidentally spilled my coffee, which made her slow her pace. My eyes darted towards her ID badge. Bingo! Allison Monroe. She took a little detour, gave me a sympathetic smile, and disappeared into the building. I returned home and looked her up online. Once Id found a hi-res photo of her, I brought it up to the laptops camera and attempted to sign in. Facial features not recognized. it said. Damn. A photo wouldnt do the trick.

Social media is a wonderful and terrible thing. Finding Allison on Facebook was easy, and shed brilliantly provided links to her Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest accounts. It wasnt hard to find out Allys likes and dislikes. She went out every Friday night to get drunk with her friends, she took baking classes on Sundays (with little to no success), and she loved taking photos of motherboards. Like, a TON of them. She fancied herself the artist, zooming in real close and applying a variety of filters. To be honest, her work looked pretty neat. She turned used computers into sci-fi-looking cityscapes. I came up with a fairly simple plan: Id approach her Friday night, charm the pants off of her, buy her a bunch of drinks, and point the laptop to her face once she was sufficiently out of it. Turns out, it was even easier than that. By the time I arrived at her favorite pub, she was already three sheets to the wind. I waited for her friends to take a washroom break, quickly pulled the laptop out of my bag, placed it on the bar, and told the drunken girl that we were taking a selfie. Eyes half shut, she lazily made a peace sign with her hands and grinned at the camera. Facial features not recognized. warned the computer, as I snatched it up and made my way towards the door. Crap, crap, crap. Her eyes must have been closed.

The moon was but a small sliver in the sky, and I watched it slowly make its way from rooftop to rooftop until the wee hours of the night. I waited for my little Ally to stagger out of the bar, and offered her a ride. She gleefully accepted and threw herself into the back seat. She probably thought I was a taxi driver. Oh, Ally. Sweet, nave Ally. I chuckled and drove back to my place. There was only one option left. I dragged her barely-conscious body inside and set her comfortably on the couch. I got tape and attempted to stick her eyelids open, but this made her agitated for some reason. She thrashed and screamed and caused a scene. I panicked: what if the neighbors heard?! I instinctively reached for the candy bowl on the living room table, sending Skittles hurling in all directions. They bounced and cascaded onto the floor like a colorful waterfall. In a swift motion, I knocked the bowl against Allys gentle head, intending only to calm her down. Blood gushed out of her skull like lava from an exploding volcano. I backed away in shock, slipped on the candy and fell to the floor. Everything went black.

By the time I came to, Ally was gone. I checked her pulse: her hands were cold and her skin had taken on an eerie blue sheen. Brownish stains of dried blood adorned the side of her head. My breath felt trapped in my throat and I had to swallow hard to get the air flowing into my lungs once more. My fingers stretched out towards her delicate face. I pried her eyelids open and, much to my surprise, they remained that way after I let go. She has such beautiful green eyes, not unlike the color of her precious motherboards. I lifted the laptop, convinced this time that the facial recognition software would be satisfied. Facial features not recognized. it said. Curses. I owed it to Ally to find out what was in there. What if she had other artsy photos to show the world?! It was my DUTY to open that laptop.

A thought crossed my mind, as I sat there desperately looking at my beautiful Allison: what if the facial recognition apparatus had some sort of heat-detection sensor? Yeah, that made sense. How else would it know the difference between a photo and a real person? I had no choice. I grabbed a knife from the kitchen, carved her lovely features off and removed her eyeballs carefully with a spoon. It pained me to do so, and the gushing sound almost made me ill. What was once a vibrant young woman now sat lifeless on my couch, her face in my hands like a stack of ham coated in chunky salsa.

I carefully brought Allys face to mine: it was cold, uncomfortable, and hindered my ability to breathe. I left it on for a few minutes, waiting for my body heat to transfer onto her flesh, while I held her eyeballs in my hands. Once I was convinced the face was warm enough, I skillfully peeled the forehead back and slipped the now warm eyes into its sockets, before pushing the skin back in place. I turned towards the laptop in a hurry. Facial features not recognized. it said. DAMN IT! I tossed the darn thing across the room out of frustration. It landed upside-down, and I spotted a label on its underbelly. I crawled over and looked at it. GOD DAMN IT, I am a MORON. Why hadnt I seen the label sooner?! Why hadnt I thought to check every inch of the laptop for clues!? What a horrible mistake! The label stated, in clear black letters: Steve Monroe. Urgh, I was going to have to start from scratch 




 One. Two. Three. Four. GOOSEBUMPS. 




 Theres someone outside my front door. Hes been standing there for hours. He knocked once, and then just stood there waiting. Hes at the door right now. I dont know what he wants. Hes not going away. I peeked through the window, but at my angle, I can barely make out a humanoid form. I think he has his face pressed against the peephole because, when I look through it, all I see is a dark beige mass. Im scared. Im so scared.

I was cooking supper when I heard the knock. It startled me to the point that I knocked a can of tomato juice over myself. Since I wasnt expecting any guests, I figured it was a solicitor of some sort. I started cleaning the mess, hoping hed give up and leave on his own. I cant believe the amount of tomato juice that can fit in a single can. My clothes weighed me down and I dragged the red liquid all the way to the bathroom, where I washed up and changed. Sporting a fresh pair of pajamas, I approached the living room window, convinced the front porch would be empty, and peered outside. The man was still at the door. I tapped the window lightly with my hand. I wasnt going to open the door unless I saw who it was first. The man did not react.

A familiar fizzling sound emerged from the kitchen. Oh, great, Id let the water boil over. I sprinted to the stove, trembling hand carefully navigating around foamy water and steam escaping from my pot, and quickly turned down the heat. The water sighed contently and dropped to the middle of its stainless steal nest. I threw fresh linguine into it and watched as they danced around like worms wriggling through the earth. Once the noodles were cooked, I served myself a plate and headed into the dining room. From the table, I watched my front door. Surely, the man had left by now, I thought. No one would wait outside a door for half an hour just to sell a magazine subscription. He had to know I wasnt interested in whatever stupid thing he had to sell. I ate my pasta, still feeling shaken by the creeper outside. No matter how often my wobbly hands dropped the fork, I managed to wolf down my meal. The spaghetti sauce was to die for.

After cleaning the dishes, I peered out the window again. He was still standing there! I went from thinking he was the worlds most annoyingly persistent door-to-door salesman, to realizing that his plans were of a far more sinister nature. Still, he hadnt made an effort to get inside, and I had locked the deadbolt, so I thought itd be okay to take a shower. My false sense of security did not last long. As soon as I got behind the shower curtain, I began to daydream about the man breaking the window and crawling into the bathroom to commit unspeakable atrocities to me. I felt naked. I mean, obviously I was naked because no one showers with his or her clothes onbut I felt naked INSIDE. I needed something to help me feel safe, so I ran to the kitchen, in the buff, and grabbed my sharpest cleaver. I nearly slipped on the way back, but I managed to steady myself. I placed the knife next to the shampoo, and finished showering with renewed confidence.

Clean as a whistle, I took a seat in the living room to watch some TV. The windows were distracting: they felt like giant magnifying glasses pointed directly at me. If I could see outside, then he could see inside. I rushed to flip the blinds shut, and spotted his form outside my door as I reached for the final pulley. This guy was going to kill me. I just knew it. I frantically shut the curtains and sat on my sofa, pulling a blanket over myself. Who could the man be? Why hadnt he knocked a second time? Why hadnt he rung the doorbell? In how many pieces would they find my body? Why hadnt he called out? The rush of fear made it hard to focus on the television screen. I flipped to the news, picturing the reporters solemn face as he explained how my quiet suburban home had been broken into and how I had been brutally maimed, my remains scattered throughout the house. They would call it a tragedy and would mourn the loss of someone so young and so full of promise. The thought brought tears to my eyes.

After an hour of contemplating my own mortality while watching M*A*S*H reruns, I had to use the restroom. I was afraid of leaving the living room because it meant having to walk by the front door. I ducked under the peepholes oppressive gaze and stealthily made my way to the cabinet, retrieving masking tape. I ripped off two pieces, placing one over the peephole and another over a hole in the middle of my door. Now, my assailant would be as blind as I was. I went to the washroom, took care of business, and walked by the door again. My nose caught whiff of a putrid smell: a wrestlers armpits mixed with half-off burrito night farts, and just a touch of rusted iron. How could I have been so careless?! I remembered Id felt a draft under my door a few days earlier and hadnt gotten around to applying sealant. The stranger outside could see me if he leaned down. I rushed to tape the bottom of the door. It was wet, so I had trouble getting the tape to stick, but after applying indiscriminate amounts of the stuff in zig-zaggy patterns, I finally managed to hide the crack.

I spent the rest of the evening nervously Googling kitten pictures. I wanted to get my mind off the man at the door. Anything to keep my brain from running through the horrific death montage. No amount of fluffy, adorable cuteness could penetrate my furiously beating heart. I could almost feel the strangers presence at my door. I know what I am saying is impossible, but it really felt as though I could see the outline of his body pressed against the surface, like a footprint on the snow. There was someone at my door, but it felt like he was inside. Another dozen minutes of absolute terror passed, and I had had enough. I grabbed the gun off the coffee table, tore the masking tape from the hole in the door, and placed the barrel inside. I examined the burnt wood around its circumference carefully. Id have to be careful not to get splinters when I repaired it. I hate splinters almost as much as I hate being brutally mutilated by a stranger at the door. I braced myself, and fired a shot. Theres someone at the door, and I dont think hes alive anymore. I better get a mop to clean up the tomato juice. I think I missed a spot. 




 How well do you pay attention to your list of recently opened documents? Last night, when tracking down a file I had worked on, I spotted an unfamiliar filename on the list: ryansjournal.docx. Privacy be dammed, I read it. I wish I hadnt. A whole day has gone by, and I still cannot shake the goose bumps: the content wasdisturbing, to say the least. Take a look:    

**Entry 1 - July 2nd, 2014:**

*My name is Ryan and Im 11 years old. Im writing this journal for a time capsule Im burying. Hi, older me! Hope you made it as a firefighter!*

*Me and mom moved this week. Theres a lot of boxes everywhere. I dont like it here. Its really small. I miss my big backyard with the pool and all the oak trees. I used to climb them and pretend I was king of the forest. There are no trees here. Just a fence and a bit of grass. I hate it. I dont know anyone here. The worst is that its REALLY creepy at night. The shadows in my room look like theyre about to reach out and grab me. Im too old for a nightlight so I snuck a flashlight under my pillow so mom wont ask questions.*

My intention in moving was simple: shorten my commute to work and lower my bills. I was wasting so much money heating up an entire house, when a two-bedroom apartment did the job. The apartment is in the basement, so it requires less AC in the summer and less heating in the winter. As an added bonus, the place is pitch black at night. The master bedroom in my old house overlooked a street lamp. Not even the blackest of curtains could keep the light from shining in and, as a result, I had trouble falling asleep. I sleep like a baby in this apartment.

**Entry 2  July 16th, 2014:**

*Mom finished unpacking. She must have forgotten a few boxes, because I dont have any toys to play with. I still dont have any friends because mom wont let me go to the park. She said Ill make new friends when school starts. I think shes just too lazy to show me the way to the park. This sucks! I hate it here! I hate HER! Shes the WORST! I wish I had someone to talk to! I want to go home! Every night, the shadows get closer and closer to my bed and I scare them away with my flashlight. Im afraid the batteries will die.*

**Entry 3  July 30th, 2014:**

*Today, I made a new friend!!! His name is Deacon and he lives in my closet behind a super-secret door Im not supposed to tell mom about. Hes really fun. His favorite color is green, just like me! I hope me and Deacon will be friends forever. He likes all the same food as me and plays all the same games! Hes older and a little scary-looking, but I dont mind. Hes fun! He even told me he could protect me from the shadows at night.*

**Entry 4  August 13th, 2014:**

*I asked mom if Deacon could have supper with us tonight, but she ignored me. She was on her computer again, looking at weird symbols all evening. I grabbed an extra plate of food after supper and took it to my room for Deacon. He loved the ground beef but didnt touch the peas. I cant blame him. Peas are gross!*

I work as a Web Developer at a University, and August is our busiest time of the year. Its not unusual for me to have to do a bit of overtime in the weeks leading up to the start of the Fall semester. I suppose HTML code can look a lot like weird symbols to the untrained eye. I can read HTML like you would read a book. Its like my mind automatically renders the tags into their intended format. I suppose to others, it must be as foreign as sheet music is to me: I do not understand it and all I see are a bunch of dots on a half-dozen lines.

**Entry 5  August 27th, 2014:**

*Mom still wont let me invite Deacon for supper, so I have to sneak food to him every night. She keeps telling me Deacon isnt real. She says Im too old to have an imaginary friend. I told her to go suck a turdsicle. She didnt like that. I was sent to my room. Grrr. I hate her. Deacon is real! Hes my best friend! He even crawls into bed with me at night to protect me from the scary shadows in the room. He holds me so tight that I cant move sometimes. He says as long as were together were safe. I believe him. I see the shadows scurrying away and up the wall whenever he crawls over.*

**Entry 6  September 24th, 2014:**

*Sorry I didnt write for a while. I started school and had SO MUCH homework. Mom wont let me on the computer unless Im done. 5th graders get a LOT of homework. By the time Im done, moms on her stupid websites and wont let me have my turn. Why cant we have two computers like a normal family?!!??!?! At least I have Deacon to talk to. Mom doesnt like it when she hears us talk. She says its not healthy to talk to myself. Shes a triple-stupid dumb-shake with a cherry on top! If shed just let him eat with us, shed see hes real.*

A crudely drawn [MS Paint doodle](http://i57.tinypic.com/2n8vcyx.jpg) was included with this entry. On it, I can make out Ryan with a tall, dark figure looming over him, holding his shoulders. The man has long, claw-like fingers, big dark holes for eyes, and a large gaping smiling mouth with sharp fangs. He seems to be looking at my cat, who is cowering in the corner of the room.

**Entry 7  October 8th, 2014:**    

*Deacon isnt happy. Mom found his hiding spot. She got rid of all his stuff!!! Hes hiding in the ceiling now. Theres a little crawl space where the air conditioner goes. Hes in there right now. I can hear him grunting. Hes so upset. Mom needs to apologize if she knows whats good for her.*    

I did find a little door in the walk-in closet. I opened it up and got a face full of dust. There were a few boxes of trinkets, which I assumed belonged to the apartments previous owners. I tossed them out. Who needs old rags, magazines, and worn shoes? I found the small storage space after hearing skittering noises in the walls. I wasnt sure if mice had gotten in, or if the apartment was crackling from the cold outside. I never dreamed I would find the perfect place to store winter apparel. I cleaned it up and filled it with coats and boots.    
 

**Entry 8  October 22nd, 2014:**

*Deacon couldnt come and protect me last night because mom left my bedroom door open. He said he doesnt want her to see us together. She might make him go away if she saw him and the shadows. I was so scared. I cried myself to sleep. I needed his big strong arms to protect me. I woke up in the middle of the night and saw shadows crawling towards me. They lifted from the floor and made squishy noises like they were made of slime putty. I screamed for my mom but she didnt come. One of the shadows got on the bed and I felt it crawling towards me. Threw my flashlight at it. It must have landed on the switch, because it lit up and the shadows disappeared under the bed.*

I remember keeping the door open because the room smelled awful and desperately needed to be aired out. I always keep the door shut so at least one room is devoid of cat fur. I would have opened the window instead of the door, but it has been stuck since the move and no amount of force has managed to pry it loose. I had no choice but to leave the door open all day and overnight. I was pleasantly surprised that the cat did not even try to step foot inside.

**Entry 9  November 5th, 2014:**

*Mom has been keeping my door open. Deacon is getting really angry with her. He says hes going to have to deal with her soon. I warned her Deacon was getting mad, but shes still insisting Deacon isnt real. Stupid stupid stupid. Deacon is watching.*

That entry is the last one in the journal. If that wasnt creepy enoughheres the really weird thing: Im single and I live alone with my cat. I do not nor have I ever- had a child. I dont know what to say: maybe its a bad prank, but I checked the file properties and it was created in July and last updated on November 5th. I havent had houseguests since late October. My computer is not synched up to any device, nor does it have the capability to do so.

I noticed the entries are typically written every other Wednesday, so I am curious to see if there will be a new one tomorrow. If there is, I will give you guys an update.

**Update (November 19th, 2014):** I barely slept last night. I decided to check the journal before I went to work. I dont even know what to say. To say that I am horrified is putting it lightly. Here is the entry:

**Entry 10  November 19th, 2014:**

*Deacon is real and hes coming for you. Deacon is real and hes coming for you. Deacon is real and hes coming for youunless the shadows get you first.*

I think I am going to stay at a motel tonight.

**Update (November 24th, 2014):** I just wanted to give you guys an update. I think I am freaking myself out over nothing. Ever since I read the journal, I keep seeing things move around in the dead of night. Around 3:00 a.m. this morning, I got up to use the restroom and saw my cat standing in the kitchen. He walked towards his food bowl and I heard a familiar crunching sound. I left him alone and went back to bed. As I slipped under the covers, my foot grazed my cat's head and he gave me an insulted, half-asleep meowl. There's no way he ran past me from the kitchen into my room: the hallway is too narrow. I would have seen or felt him. I was probably just sleep-deprived and imagined seeing him in the kitchen.

People asked to see the drawing I found in Ryan's journal. It has been uploaded: [Ryan's Drawing](http://i57.tinypic.com/2n8vcyx.jpg) 




 I recommend making asking them to make a deal. Have you ever wanted to be famous? Now's the time to promise your first unborn son (or daughter) for your 15 minutes of fame! : ) Do not try to get your original child back. Allowing themselves to become possessed so easily is a sign of weakness. 




 You nearly made me spit out my water! XD 




 Actually, I do. My college buddy used to work at Canadian Tire. Next time he's in town, I'll ask him to check it out. Thanks for the suggestion! 




 I found the one I was talking about: it belonged to James Dean. If you look it up, the name of the car was 'Little Bastard'. Other people bought parts from that car and, well, it did not end well.

As for my parts, I have absolutely no idea how to check. I'm not a big driver. I just use my car to do groceries. My mechanical knowledge extends to noticing the oil change sticker expiration date and driving the  car to a garage. 




 At my dentist, there are two other people who share my name, one of which has the same date of birth as me. I always have to give the clerk my full address when booking appointments because of it. You're making me wonder if we all have future selves out there, trying to come into contact with us. 




 I think I know what you're talking about. The race car that some dude died in, and then its pieces wound up in other cars and it all of those cars ended up in really bad accidents? Maybe my car's not haunted. Maybe it's one of its replacement parts. Haunted muffler? 




 xD; It's not the most badass and newest of cars, but it gets the job done.

Before you ask, it plays CDs, not cassette tapes. 




 I'm due for a new car soon anyway. Spent so much cash on repairs this past year. The muffler, the battery, the engine. X_x; 




 Hey guys. I have an honest-to-goodness question for yall. Can cars become haunted? Ive seen some really weird stuff in my car. This isnt a scary story, for the record: this is 100% for real, and it has been happening for the past couple of years.

I drive a 10-year-old red Toyota Corolla (a bitchin color, if I do say so myself). Im its second owner, the first owners being my parents. I bought it off of them last year when they retired and decided to ditch their house and car in favor of their truck and trailer. Point being: this isnt some used, refurbished car I got off of Craigslist after it killed a bunch of innocent kids in a horrible traffic incident. I mean, it has had a few bumps and bruises along the way. My sister once told us that car insurance companies charge higher rates for red cars because they tend to be involved in traffic accidents more often. For the record, this is not true. The color of your car does not affect insurance rates. Despite the fact that my sisters claim was wrong, I cant deny that the car has gotten in a lot of minor accidents, compared to the other cars my parents drove over the years. Accident/bump/scrape count on all other cars combined over the course of about 20 years: 0. Accident/bump/scrape count on the Corolla: about 5.

Itd be easy to blame the accidents on the fact that the Corolla was driven by two new drivers (my sister and I), as well as my parentsbut my sister never hit anything and I only scratched it once. I felt absolutely awful about it, though. It was one of my first times taking it out and I was backing out of a grocery store parking lot. My bumper scraped another cars bumper. Juuuust enough for a little dirt to transfer from one car to the other. I freaked out and waited for the cars drivers. They just laughed, thanked me for waiting, and left without taking down my information. It was so small and insignificant, but to this day I park at the far end of parking lots and walk the rest of the way. Every other incident occurred while one of my parents was behind the wheel. Mom once backed up into a cement post, my dad got rear-ended by a truck and ended up hitting one of those trailer balls on the car in front of him (theres still a hole-shaped mark in our front bumper, makes it easy to spot my car!), and at some point someone crashed into the side of the vehicle. There are also unexplained scratches on the car. Like, someone TRYING to key it but not using an instrument sharp enough to do the trick. No injuries, no deaths. Definitely nothing that qualifies as a reason for a car to be haunted.

I remember one day my dad, sister, and I were driving to the library. I saw an old man get on the road as we were passing. My eyes widened and my heart came to a halt when I realized my father was not stopping the car. I nearly shouted, fully expecting to hear a THUD at any moment. Nothing happened. I looked back but there was no one on the street. Didnt you see that guy? I asked my father and sister. Neither of them had a clue what I was talking about. Ghost pedestrian? Who the fuck knows.

What really spooks me is what Ive been seeing IN the car since then. Back in our old house, the kitchen overlooked a living room with large bay windows pointed straight at the driveway. Every now and then, Id turn around and see someones figure in the drivers seat. Im not talking about a creepy shadow in the night, either. I meanI was doing the dishes after making lunch and thered be a silhouette in there. It didnt disappear when I blinked. Id usually get distracted for a moment and look again, only to find the car was empty. This happened ALL the time. At least twice a month. One night, I was driving back home and I looked in the rearview mirror. Yknow in those horror movies when you see a figure in the mirror? Holy shit, it happened. I very VERY clearly saw a man sitting in the back seat. I turned my head but of course there was nothing there.

I recently moved and the car cannot be seen from any of my windows. I see the car when I get out of the bus and when I take out the trash. When I do, often times, Ill see a figure in there. Heck, just last week I went to the grocery store and, on my way back to the car, I got this weird feeling. I looked up and there was someone in the drivers seat. It doesnt matter what angle the cars in, either. Ive seen the silhouette straight-on, from the back, and from the side. So what do you think? Can cars become haunted? Is MY car haunted? How the heck does a car even get haunted???

Update (Nov 15th 2014): I spotted a footprint facing my car in a patch of snow outside this morning. I know it's not mine: I only take the car out on weekends to run errands. Haven't been near it since last Saturday. Maybe one of the neighbours got nosy. 




 Brilliantly written. I love the slow descent into instability! 




 Do you think its still alive?! shrieked Courtney, mere seconds after impact. She regained control of the car and came to a complete stop. I looked out the window, towards a dark mass spread out on the road. IuhI dont know. I replied, gathering myself. My neck felt stiff from the whiplash caused by her sudden stop. Courtney hid her face against the steering wheel. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god! she groaned. Babe, relax. Its not the first time youve hit something, and it probably wont be the last. Remember when you backed up over my foot? I replied cheerfully, trying to lighten her spirits. OH MY GOD, STEPHEN. When are you going to let that GO!? she shouted at me, jabbing me sharply in the side with her elbow. There were times when Courtney praised my sense of humor. This was not one of those times.

It happened in early November several years ago. It was the first snow of the season and we were caught off guard, having not changed to our winter tires on yet. The road was slippery, but Courtney was doing a good job navigating the winding roads back from our campground, where we had spent our anniversary. It had been a nice, clothing-optional weekend, away from the hustle and bustle of our suburban lives. We were driving through a heavily forested area when we spotted something up ahead. We barely had time to register those big doe eyes, before we were already on top of it. Courtney tried to stop, but the tires slipped on a patch of slush and caught the poor thing with the corner of the car. I guess reindeers arent the only woodland creatures that can fly!
 
Maaaan, Bambis going to have a pretty shitty family reunion. I chirped playfully. I felt another jab from Courtneys adamantium elbows. STOP FUCKING AROUND AND GO CHECK ON IT! she screamed. I tried to tell her it was best to call the authorities. Approaching a wounded animal is never a good idea. I could picture myself getting kicked by the thing. My ribs had gotten enough abuse for one night, thank you very much. Youd be surprised how hard someone as small as Courtney can ram an elbow into you. She shoved a flashlight in my hand and pointed out the window. It might still be alive! Go help it! she insisted. I sighed and relented.

I stepped out of the car and carefully made my way around, checking for damage. The headlights were still functioning, and the impact had only caused a reasonably small bump. Ive seen pictures of cars nearly totalled after hitting a deer. I figured we got really lucky. Satisfied with my inspection, I turned around to check out the deer, but I slipped on some ice and disappeared from view. Courtney rolled down her window and shouted: ARE YOU OKAY!? Never missing an opportunity to be an insufferable asshole, I started screaming my ass off. ITS GOT ME!! OH GOD ITS GOD ME!! IT HAS FANGS!!! I shouted, smacking my hand against the car door. I started laughing hysterically and pulled myself back to my feet. Courtney had the look on her face. If youve ever had a girlfriend, you know exactly what Im talking about. I threw my hands into the air and backed away from the car. I know, I know: stop being an asshole, check on the deer. I said, before she had the chance to scold me.

I approached the creature cautiously and slowly. I remember being really surprised by how little blood I saw. Having never hit anything more sentient than a trash can, I assumed there would be a fountain of blood gushing out or something. After another few steps, the flashlight died. Its kind of cool how, during the darkest time of the year, the ground gets covered in a substance that reflects even the smallest of light. The moonlit snow provided enough light to forget about the extra batteries I had in the trunk. DO YOU THINK ITS STILL ALIVE!? Courtney shouted from the car. I sighed and rolled my eyes: Jesus Christ, Court. Give me a fuckin minute. I barked back. The cold was getting me grumpy. I rubbed my unprotected hands together and watched my breath escape my lips and dissipate into the air.

The creature wasnt moving. At least, not from what I could tell. From a distance, I could see weird streaks across its body. With every step I took, I got the feeling something wasnt right with it. Its front legs lay completely flat on the ground as though devoid of bones while its hind legs looked bloated. I finally reached it and knelt down. Those werent marks on its flesh: they were stitches. Courtney waited silently, providing me with no sound but that of the engine calmly purring away. I secretly wished she would beckon me back to the car. I hesitantly reached for the does head and turned it lightly. I nearly pissed myself. Its eyes were open and looking straight at me. I was so spooked that I dropped the head. It made a strange clunking sound when it hit the concrete. I realized in that moment that the eyes werent real. They were fucking glass eyes.

I wanted to run the fuck back to the car, but curiosity got the better of me. As though in a trance, I traced my hands along the many stitches. It became clear, judging by the variety of colors on the does body, that I was looking at more than one animal crudely sewn together. I shuffled to the other side of the creature and actually screamed, falling on my ass. It was a man. A FUCKING MAN. He was sticking out of the Frankenbambi, wearing it like some sick ass costume. From what I could see, he appeared to be completely nude. Moonlight reflected off of something near his left hand: it was a sharp-looking hunting knife. The fingers of his right hand were still tightly clutched around a handgun. The mans blood slowly soaked into the suit hed made himself. Stomach twisting, I bolted back towards the car and got into the passengers seat. I knew. He wasnt some weird pervert. He wasnt the worlds weirdest method actor. He wasnt trying to blend in with the deer. He meant to stop us on the road. I just knew. I just fucking knew. He meant to stop us and to kill usor worse.

Courtney shook me, Sowas it still alive? she asked me, apparently ignoring the absolute horror in my eyes. She seemed to have cheered up at least. I shook my head slowly, placing a hand on my chest. no. Drive. Just drive. I told her. She let out a little whimper, and then drove off. I didnt want to tell her what I saw. Some things are better left unsaid. The next day, I called the authorities to let them know we saw a dead deer on the road. I figured theyd think I was just an oblivious Good Samaritan reporting a road hazard. They bought it. Until now, Ive never told anyone the truth about the doe. What really creeps me out is that there were no reports of mysterious deaths in the media. When I think back to that night, Imnot entirely surebutI looked back in the rear-view mirror as we drove offand I think I saw it move. He might still be out there 




 Eeeeeeeeee, way to send a chill down my spine! Oh, crazy 'ol aunt Ruth. 




 Y'know what? If I get my hands on a tank, I'll go and let ya'll know how it went. 




 One had the flu and the other said she didn't have a ride. They bail on me ALL the time, so I'm not surprised. 




 Most of you would probably agree that high school isnt nearly as awesome as TV shows make it out to be. These are the best years of your life! parents often say. What a load of crock. Its no surprise, then, that when I received an invitation to attend my 10-year high school reunion, my reaction wasnt so much YAY!!!, but rather, Yeaaaah, no. I crumbled up the invitation into a neat little ball, which I promptly threw into my overflowing recycling bin. I had been bullied a lot in high school, and the last thing I wanted was to talk to those people again. It was only after relentless nagging from my friends that I reluctantly agreed to go. I wish I hadnt. The night of my 10-year highschool reunion was the weirdest and scariest of my life.


I sat in the parking lot, waiting for my overzealous friends to show up. They promised me we didnt have to socialize, and that the three of us would just hang out all night and check things out. I looked at my phone. They were late, and had not left me any messages. I shifted about in my seat, tugging at my extremely uncomfortable dress. I had been forced to buy it for the reunion, which just added to my frustration. Ive never been at ease in a dress. Wearing one just feels unnatural to me, like Im galloping around in a clown outfit. I sent my friends a text message, while idly eyeing the banner above the main doors. Welcome Class of 2000!!! it said, in big, bold letters. I could hear music blaring from the agora. It started to get a little chilly, so I headed into the school. My friends had not replied.


Annoyed and wanting to go home, I grabbed my nametag off the table and pinned it to my dress strap. I followed the horrendous sound of techno music and found my way into the cafeteria, which opened up to our schools large agora. On the stage, huge speakers throbbed and vomited the sorry excuse for music into a dancing crowd. There were oceans of balloons and streamers hanging from the ceiling. I glanced towards the table of refreshments. A group of at least thirty people stood in front of it, obscuring my view of the punch bowl. There was something off about the whole scene, but I couldnt quite put my finger on it.


I scanned the room and realized something: I didnt know most of these people. At first, I figured they were my classmates significant others, but upon further inspection, I realized they outnumbered the familiar faces 3 to 1. I checked my phone again. Neither of my friends had contacted me. Figures, they bailed on meAGAIN. I was fumbling, trying to get my phone back into the cheap purse I had bought for the occasion, when someone bumped into me. I recognized her immediately, and my stomach dropped. It was Marie-Claude, my main tormentor. I was sure her dead-beat ass wouldnt show up here. I was wrong. She gave me a weird look and spoke: Hi. Its nice to see you again she began, then paused to look at my name tag, Caroline. she finished. I forced a smile and nodded: Yeah, uh. You too. I answered, feeling nauseous. This skank tortured me for five years, and her cordial attitude didnt sit well with me. I wasnt that surprised that she forgot my name: I couldnt recall the name of most of my classmates. I remembered their faces, though, so theres that. I excused myself and walked off.


In a quick pace, I walked towards the refreshments. People were still swarming around it like fruit flies on a rotten apple. Strange thing is, I could have sworn it was the exact same people as before. One of the many strangers roaming the cafeteria approached me. Hi. Its nice to see you againCaroline. he said, using the exact same tone and inflection that Marie-Claude had used earlier, and checking my name tag just like she had done. I dont think I know you I replied, taking a step away. His vacant stare suggested hed had too much to drink. I turned on my heels and walked right into another stranger. Hi. Its nice to see you againCaroline. she said as well. By then, I was thoroughly crept out. Things were getting too weird for comfort. I scurried off to the side, trying to gather myself, but everyone I came across said the exact same thing. Was this some kind of elaborate prank?


Techno music continued to play non-stop. I stared at my cell phone, pretending I was doing something so I could avoid having to socialize further. It took me a good ten minutes to look up again. It wasnt my imagination: the group around the punch bowl hadnt budged. I slowly shifted my gaze towards the agora to get a better look at the dancers. Upon closer inspection, I realized they werent so much dancing as they were thrashing about, repeating the same motion over and over again, like moths banging themselves against a window to get to the light inside. Have you ever looked at the audience in sport videogames? To give the illusion of a living crowd, the audience is given a set of 2-3 reoccurring moves, which they randomly cycle through. Thats exactly what the dancers looked like to me. My focus then changed to the music. I may be a little bias here, because I dont like techno, but I could have sworn the song hadnt changed since my arrival. It was just looping the same noises with frustrating repetition. It was giving me one hell of a headache.


I walked into the washroom, feeling an immediate sense of relief. The thick concrete wall shielded me from the assaulting music outside. I smiled as I spotted the sink: it protruded from the wall in a large semi-circle, around which you could fit at least five people. A step pedal underneath allowed the user to activate two dozen small streams of water. I always liked this sink. It was user-friendly and reminded me of a fountain. I pushed down on the pedal and splashed water onto my face. So refreshing. It was then that I heard the bathroom door slowly squeaking open. I instinctively retracted into one of the stalls and locked it. I remembered this stall. The crack on the wall, the chip in the floor tile, the profanities carved into the separators. I had spent almost all my breaks hiding in that very stall. Technically, there was no reason to hide now. Someone wanted to use the washroomnothing weird there. For some reason; however, I felt an enormous amount of dread. I could hear the girls footsteps as she entered the room. I knoooow youre heeereeeee. she uttered, in a sing-song voice. My jaw dropped and I nearly screamed. I slapped my hands to my mouth to keep myself silent. The skin of my arms formed a mountain range for the microbes living on them. I held my breath, slowly climbed onto the toilet seat, and crouched. My stupid dress made it hard to stay balanced atop the porcelain throne, so I used an arm to steady myself and hoped that I would go undetected. I didnt want her to find me. I didnt know what would happen if she did. I saw her through the cracks in the stalls door. She was leaning down, trying to find my feet. My heart thumped heard. I hoped she couldnt hear it beating. Shit, shit, shit. After a few moments, she turned around and headed back to the party. I finally exhaled and shakily planted my feet back on the floor.


I waited a couple of minutes and then snuck out through washrooms other door. I was half-expecting her to be standing outside, but was relieved when I walked out to an empty hallway. I headed towards the agora. I was sure now: the music hadnt changed. Same people at the refreshment table. Same weird dancing. Just when I thought things couldnt get any scarier, shit got real. The dancing stopped. Everyones heads twisted slowly and mechanically towards me, in unison. They were wearing eerie, crooked smiles. My stomach dropped and my heart nearly stopped. I turned to the cafeteria, and the punchbowl crowd starred at me with the same unearthly grin and vacant eyes. Shit, Id had enough. I ran out of there like a bat out of hell, my legs spreading out so far that my dress ripped. I didnt stop until I reached my car, and then I sped home, going right through a red light. Honestly, I think I would have been relieved if cops had caught me, because at least then I could tell someone to go check out the high school.


Hands trembling, I opened the door to my apartment and locked it behind me, ripping the dress from my sweaty body. I could barely catch my breath. Again, I wondered if it was some kind of horrible prank. Maybe all my bullies had gotten together for one final hoorah? Nothere were too many people involved. Too many moving parts. NO ONE would go through THAT much trouble to freak out someone they hadnt seen or spoken to in 10 years, right? God damn, it was scary as shit. I still have nightmares about that night. If it was a prank, mission fucking accomplished. Its been almost 5 years and I still get rattled just thinking about it.


Today, in the mail, I received a Save The Date! for the 15-year reunion coming up this spring. Oh hell no. You better believe I ripped that bitch up. I am NOT going, and no amount of nagging from my friends will convince me otherwise. 




 Thanks, I'm glad you liked it. : )

It was my bad. Suspension of disbelief and all that. Haunted, talking walls are unfortunately not believable. 




 Oh, goodness. This was absolutely wonderful. Cudos to you! 




 They found the body. It was real.
 
Last night, I took my friend Todd out to a midnight showing of Nightmare on Elm Street at the theatre. Todd had been bummed out after spraining his ankle just in time to miss the annual 10k Halloween Zombie marathon. Hed been training for months and had prepared an awesome costume. He even bought finger-shaped gummy candy to shove into his mouth during the run. You know, for realism. He kept joking that hed eat the other marathon runners if he ran out of candy. I argued that his constant limping would actually make his costume more realistic, and that he should go anyways, but he refused, claiming that he wanted to avoid irritating the injury. Todd had always had a competitive streak. When we were younger, he would race me to the swing sets, jump on the couch to distract me while we were playing Mario Kart, and drag me kicking and screaming off of our makeshift wrestling ring made out of sofa pillows. Though Todd wouldnt admit it, I knew he was sitting the marathon out to avoid being the last one to cross the finish line.
 
Bellies weighed down with two tons of popcorn and Halloween chocolate, we started our slow walk home. Mr. Tough-guy acted like he was fine, but I saw him wincing every time his right foot made contact with the ground. Hey. I said, breaking the silence that had followed us since the theatre, I know a shortcut to your placeif youre not too chicken shit to take it. I proposed. Todd puffed his chest out and chuckled loudly: Youre on, dog-breath. Dont come cryin to me like a little wuss if you get scared. he replied, looking quite proud of his comeback. Adulthood had made us wiser, but certainly not more mature. I turned a corner and lead Todd down the shortcut I had only taken a couple of times before. A cold wind blew through the deserted street. Trick-or-treaters had long since returned home and fallen into diabetic comas from all the sugar. My Halloween coma was going to start the next day, once I bought leftover candy from the store for a fraction of the cost.
 
I grinned as we passed a parked car. What the heck. I said. Todd quirked a brow and turned his head towards me. What? he replied, confused. The license plate. I answered, motioning to the car. It had the typical three-digit, three-letter format, and its three letters read W-T-H. Its a game. You have to make words or acronyms out of the letters. I explained. Todd seemed intrigued. He glanced at another car. OK. I think I got it. So, like, over thereDBT. To Be Determined, if youre dyslexic! he said. A chuckle escaped my lips. I gave him a thumbs-up, I like that. OK, lets seeover there, weve got SPK: Spooky? I continued. We both started laughing when we spotted one that read SMB. We kept this up for a good ten minutes, listing out words and acronyms for every car we spotted. We got stumped when we came across XLS, until Todd proudly claimed it was Excels file format. Shit, I should have taught him this game sooner.
 
We turned another corner, only to come face-to-face with a roadblock. Construction crews all over the city were struggling to finish their work before the freeze. Travel had gotten difficult for pedestrians. To get to work that morning, I had to take FIVE freaking detours. Fortunately, I spotted a bike path through a small forest on our left. I had a vague recollection of seeing a path near Todds house, so I figured wed get there eventually if we took it. I didnt have the heart to tell Todd we had to double-back and make him walk on that ankle of his, so I trudged onward, acting like I meant for us to go there. I spotted an unmarked black van just outside the entrance, and nudged Todd to look at it: Check out surveillance van #6. You didnt tell me the FBI was watching your neighborhood! I joked. He stuck his tongue out at me and replied: Theyre here to monitor YOU, bud. After a good laugh, we wandered into the path.
 
We were surrounded by trees, which were being eaten away slowly by the frigid autumn air. Small clusters of brown and yellow leafs still clutched to the menacing-looking branches above us. In the darkness of the night, they looked like hundreds of bats waiting to descend onto us. Thats when we saw him: a hooded man standing no less than 20 meters in front of us, a shovel in one hand and a bulky pillowcase in the other. He seemed to have come out of nowhere. At first, I mistook him for a lost trick-or-treater, but I soon realized he was far too old and what I thought was a bag full of candy had an eerie shape and dripped an unknown liquid onto the leaf-covered ground beneath it. For a moment, time seemed suspended. Neither Todd, the stranger, nor I made a single move. If not for the thrashing sensation of my heart beating against my chest, I would have thought we were in a movie that someone had paused. My eyes slowly trailed towards a pile of dirt just next to the gravel road, and then to the large hole in its shadow. My mind was racing. Every inch of me wanted to run. There was something so unnatural about the scene. It was as though the air itself had become tangible and heavy. So very heavy. Todd looked as white as a ghost. I think he was coming to the same conclusion as me, though neither one of us dared say it out loud. The hooded figure, covered in dirt, suddenly dropped the pillowcase. It hit the ground with an unnerving THUD. Something rolled out of it. I couldnt make out what it was at first. It was furry and damp. As it continued to roll, I realized what I was looking at: a head. Holy fucking shit. It was a womans head. Her lightless eyes lay open, starring right into my soul. A length of her spine dangled from what was left of her neck. Her hair was soaked in blood and flesh had gotten tangled into her locks. Adrenaline surged through my veins. We had to run. I looked at Todd, hoping to see the face of a man ready to escape. Instead, I saw a scared boy frozen in place. We couldnt stay there. We were going to get killed if we didnt run. A shameful thought crossed my mind, and even now I struggle to admit it: I thought of leaving Todd behind. He was in no condition to run. He would only slow me down. Maybe, just maybe, if I left him there, Id survive. My body trembled violently. The adrenaline was making it hard to decide between fight and flight. The stranger made the decision for me. Shovel in-hand, he bolted towards us.
 
I grabbed Todd violently by the arm: SHIT, TODD, RUN!! I screamed, hoping to all hope that I could pull him out of his stupor. I didnt care how badly his ankle hurt. I yanked him back and he finally responded. OH SHIT OH SHIT OH SHIT! screamed Todd. We started running back down the way we came. Todd was too slow, and the crazed, decapitating madman gained on us. To make matters worse, he waslaughing? I could picture Todd and I getting brutally cut up into pieces by a chainsaw as this guy laughed and laughed over our mangled remains. ITS A PRANK! howled the man behind us. He dropped the shovel and waved his arms in the air, Its for Youtube! he screamed louder. Todd and I slowed down. My cheeks flushed red as we came to a stop. I cupped my hands to my knees and inhaled deeply. W-what? I mumbled. The stranger laughed louder and pulled down his hood. He was a fairly normal-looking Caucasian male in his thirties. He pointed towards the wooded area. Were filming a Halloween prank. Oh man, you should have seen your faces. he said. My head was spinning, playing catch-up quite inefficiently. Todd began laughing hard: Shit, oh my GOSH! You got us GOOD, man. he replied, heaving a sigh of relief. I was still too rattled to comment. I genuinely thought I was going to dieall for a stupid Youtube video.
 
It took me a few minutes to compose myself. The prankster introduced himself with his Youtube handle, which I regrettably cannot remember. He asked for permission to use our reactions, and Todd enthusiastically agreed, while I gave a nonchalant, consensual wave. He smiled broadly, Great, were going to need you to sign a consent form. I didnt print enough, so Ill just mail it to you guys. Where do you live? he asked, in a friendly tone. Todd answered immediately. I wasnt quite as eager: Im from out of townIm staying over at his place. I lied. Todd understood. Ive never been big on sharing personal information with strangers. I usually glare and refuse to give out my postal code to cashiers when they ask me. Why the fuck do they need that information, anyways? Im buying something from their stupid store and I just want to go home. Stop asking. In any case, the stranger jotted down Todds address, and we were left to our own devices.
 
We continued down the bike path and stopped near the hole. Todd playfully prodded the severed head with his fingertips. Hahaha. Cool. It feels so real. he told me. I refused to touch the prop. The rest of the way, Todd chirped and laughed about how we were going to be Youtube stars, teasing me about how frightened I looked earlier. I, on the other hand, couldnt shake the feeling that something was wrong, and added very little to the conversation. The prankster kept saying we, and motioning to the trees, as though someone was filming in there. We spoke with the guy for a good twenty minutes but his buddy never came out. I never actually saw the camera, nor did I feel another persons presence there with us. I shrugged it off as nerves. Todd and I parted ways and I headed home, feeling silly about how freaking scared I was. It took me a while to fall asleep, but eventually exhaustion won out.
 
This morning, I woke up, turned on the TV, and started making breakfast. Just as I began to butter my toast, the screen turned red and BREAKING NEWS scrolled on the bottom of the frame. Police had unearthed the severed remains of a woman in a shallow grave on the bike path. Her torso and legs were found in an unmarked van not far away, along with an unidentified mans arm. Oh shit. Since then, Ive been ringing Todd up on the phone. Hes not answering. Ive texted him. Ive emailed him. I made a stupid Twitter account so I could tweet him. No answer. Why isnt Todd answering!? 




 My name is Nathan, and I am being held against my will.

I dont know how long Ive been here, but it feels like months. My prison is dark and I cannot see anything. From time to time, I hear sounds from the outside world. They are distorted and muffled, but I can make out my captors voices just enough to notice an eerily gleeful tone. The distant sounds of music also make their way into my ears. My captors play classical music all the time. Classical motherfucking music. I cant stand to hear it. Im trapped here and theyre forcing me to listen to fucking Mozart. I want to go home to my wife and daughter. Will I ever see them again? I smash my arms and legs against the walls of my cell; they are met with a spongy surface coated in nauseatingly squishy mucus. I guess not being able to see has its advantages. Im terrified of knowing what these walls are made of.

The last thing I remember before waking up is going to a take-out restaurant to pick up a meal for my family. My wife asked me to have it delivered since it was raining so hard, but I insisted on going. The food is warmer when I go get it myself. Delivery boys always seem to stop by our house at the end of their route, and I didnt feel like having another lukewarm meal. I grabbed my keys and ran out the door, jokingly promising Id be back home in time for supper. After picking up our meal, I headed back towards my house. The rain wasnt letting up at all. My wipers could barely handle the load. I knew Id be home soon so I kept going at the same speed. It was a terrible mistake. I watched as a car on the opposing lane flew through a puddle and rammed me straight off the road. Clutching the steering wheel tightly, I tried to regain control of my vehicle. The image of the tree I hit is still burned into my retinas. I cannot recall anything after that.

Ive been in this cell for so long, I barely remember how to talk. Im so lonely. My little Sophia will be turning 7 soon. Orhas she already turned 7? Its hard to tell time anymore. I used to count the days, but after they turned into months, I lost track. I want to go home. I want to hold my wife and kids in my arms and tell them I love them. Im not a perfect man by any means, but what did I ever do to deserve this? What did my FAMILY ever do to deserve this? I want to sit around our old kitchen table, with its crayon stains and chipped corners. As my thoughts continue to drift, I suddenly realize its getting harder to breathe. Theres something around my neck. My emaciated arms reach up to try and pull it off, but I havent the strength to do so. Maybe its better this way. My family must have moved on by now. I welcome the sweet relief of death.


With freedom at my fingertips, I feel a large hand reaching for me and pulling me out of my prison. NO! You son of a bitch! I was ready to die, damn it! Its too bright to see anything, so I keep my eyes closed. I can barely breathe. I cant move at all. I feel the hand slapping me firmly on the back, dislodging a chunk of mucus from my throat. I must have swallowed it when he was pulling me out. I cry out for my family. I scream and scream, begging for them to take me home. They dont listen to me. I hear them laughing. The man holding me speaks out: Its a boy! he says. No shit, Sherlock. What the fuck did you expect?! Did you think my genitals would shrivel off while you kept me locked up!? I continue to scream and thrash about in a desperate attempt to free myself. Nothing works. Fucking shit. I must be in hell.

---------
Ive been out of my spongy cell for a few months now. It was hard for my eyes to adjust to the light. I must have been in captivity for longer than I thought. My captors pretend not to understand when I scream at them. The dark cell has been traded in for a more traditional prison made of metal bars. I tried escaping many times, but Ive always been caught. I think my captors are filming me. Those sick sons of bitches. They laugh and taunt me, jiggling my prisons keys just outside my reach. They make fun of my broken body. They take such pleasure in watching me trying to crawl away whenever they take me out of my cell, only to place me back where I started. Their cruelty knows no bounds. They dont even allow me the dignity of using the bathroom on my own. Its just as wellif they treat me like an animal, then I will act like an animal. I find great pleasure in retaliating against them by urinating on them when ever they try to shame me. I feel no shame anymore. I only feel the burning desire for revenge. When they feed me their poisonous food, I toss it back to them and try my hardest to throw up on them. I make a game out of trying to get it into their mouths. I know now that I will never be free, but I sure as fuck wont go down without a fight. I will spend every damn day of this miserable life trying to inflict onto them the same hell theyve inflicted onto me. I wait at night for them to go to bed, and then I scream at the top of my lungs. I enjoy causing them sleep deprivation. Its just a little solace in my otherwise horrid experience.

Sophia, my darling daughter. If you can hear meplease know that I love you. Cher, my beautiful wife, Im sorry I didnt take your advice. I should have just had the meal delivered. I hope you know how much I miss and adore you both. Please know that I am here against my will. I would do anything to be in your arms again.

I love you. 

- Nathan 
























 Throw in a couple house chores, and you're hired! 




 Nonsense: I'm Canadian. Everything about me smells like maple syrup. And I mean *everything*. 




 Aaaaaaaaaaand I'm going to stay away from the washroom for the rest of the year. Thanks a lot. 




 Three years ago, I had a near-death experience. I dont like talking about it, because I cant remember much about the accident itself. That doesn't stop people from pressing me for details, though. *What did it feel like? Did you see the driver? What kind of car was it? Did it hurt? Did you shit yourself?* (Yes, someone actually asked me that.) I understand that we humans are curious by nature, but I get tired of being asked the same questions and not being able to answer. What I do remember are the boring details: spending a tediously long shift at work dealing with unruly costumers, heading outside in the torrential rain without an umbrella, and walking home for what felt like hours. One second, I was being pelted by cloud vomit, and the next, I heard a loud shriek of tires and saw a lifetime flash by in my head. Only thing isit wasn't *my* life I saw. A strangers memories flooded into me in their entirety, and I saw everything from this persons childhood, to her first kiss, to the monotonous days spent sitting at her high school desk. I saw it all.

 nbsp;

Recovery was a bitch. I woke up in a hospital bed pretty doped-up, but still in a lot of pain. The doctors told me I was involved in a hit-and-run incident, and that the police wanted to talk to me as soon as possible. I wasn't able to offer much information, since I had no recollection of the accident. It took an entire year of intense physiotherapy for me to be able to walk unassisted. My hatred for the unknown driver fuelled me every step of the way. As the anger burrowed deeper and deeper inside of me, my family began to notice a change in my demeanor. They eventually staged an*anger-vention*, if you will. Given time and several counselling sessions, I eventually forgave my attacker, so that I could move on and complete the emotional healing process.

 nbsp;

During my lunch break today, I took a walk along the canal and spotted a young lady in a bright pink sport jacket, merrily jogging on the other side. I recognized her immediately: it was the woman from my visions. Her name was Sarah. I gathered that much from a memory of the bear-shaped birthday cake shed gotten when she turned seven. Her name had been scribbled on its stomach in purple lettering. I felt a mix of excitement and dread: that very same feeling you get when you think someones waving at you, but then you realize you were mistaken. Sarah was a stranger, yet I knew everything about her. I ran across the nearest pedestrian bridge, and started following her. Not in a creepy or stalkery way, mind you. I had no ill intentions. I was justcurious. I felt compelled to meet her. Up until then, I had always thought the images that had flashed through my mind were purely fictitious. Now, I had proof of the contrary.

 nbsp;


As I ran towards Sarah, a knot formed my stomach. Part of me felt like a huge creep, like I had invaded her privacy by seeing all of her intimate moments, but the rest of me yearned to appease my curiosity. Had she ever seen *my* life? This girl was real, and I was looking at her, desperately trying to catch up with her rapid pace. I recalled the memory of her parents reading her bedtime stories. I remembered the time her brother had accidentally kicked her in the jaw while they were play-fighting. Shed lost her first tooth then, and she was so proud of it. I also remembered her sitting on Uncle Toms lap as they watched cartoons, and what that monster did to her when her parents were away. I slowed down, feeling a twinge of guilt. Even though I had never asked to know so much about her, it wasn't fair for me to disrupt her life like this.

 nbsp;


Just as I was about to give up and leave, Sarah stopped running. Maybe fate was telling me to go for it. What if I never got this opportunity again? It could very well have been my only chance to talk to her, if only for a moment. I didn't know what I would say exactly. I wasn't even sure if I would tell her about what I knew. Nervously, I went for it.

 nbsp;


"Hey, Sarah!", I called out from a short distance, trying to catch my breath as I jogged towards her. "T-this is going to sound insane, but I-", I began.

 nbsp;

Upon hearing her name being called, Sarah turned around. As soon as she saw me, her face became pale. She looked at me with a mix of fear and disgust, as though I was a rodent shed just found scurrying across her bed. As I bridged the distance between us, she gasped and recoiled, looking at me in shock. I was perplexed: I had no idea what I had done to upset her. Did she think I was some sort of pervert? I remembered that look on her face. She had the same look the night her father had slapped her across the face and called her a whore when hed found her sleeping with some random guy, because she had never learned to value herself. He had kicked her to the curb that night.

 nbsp;


"T-thats impossible. Y-you weren't breathing", she managed to say.

 nbsp;


Suddenly, I realized something: I had seen her face before. Not just in *her* memories, but in *mine*. I had seen her for a split second before I heard the tires screeching. I felt bad for Sarah, knowing what shed been through. I wanted to tell her that I didn't hate her, and that I forgave her long agobut then, she did what she had done the first day our eyes met: she fled the scene. The only difference is that, this time, she wasn't laughing.

 nbsp;

***
**Update 1 (January 21rst 2015 - 9:00 p.m.)**

 nbsp;

Since I now know that Sarah is real, I looked her up on Facebook. She accepted my friend request before even realizing who I was (my profile pic is of my dog, not of me). I entered into a chat session with her.

 nbsp;

**Me**: Hey Sarah. Listen, dont freak out, okay? I was the guy on the bike path today. I just want you to know that I forgive you for hitting me with your car. Im not going to press charges. I just need you to know that Im not holding on to a grudge.

 nbsp;

**Sarah**: Im sorry.

 nbsp;

**Me**: Theres something else.

 nbsp;

**Sarah**: Wut?

 nbsp;

**Me**: This is going to sound completely insanebut II saw your life.

 nbsp;

A couple minutes go by.

 nbsp;

**Me**: Hey, you still there?

 nbsp;

**Sarah**: Ya.

 nbsp;

**Me**: I know it seems impossible. Butyou know how peoples lives flash before their very eyes when theyre about to die? I got that, but with your life. You probably dont believe me.

 nbsp;

**Sarah**: Got proof?

 nbsp;

**Me**: Your locker combination is 87-15-57. You thought Ryans lips tasted like cinnamon. Uhmyou pretend you hate Katy Perry but you secretly love her songs.

 nbsp;

**Sarah**: How do u kno that?

 nbsp;

**Me**: I told you. I saw your life. All of it. I dont know howbutI was wondering if the same thing might have happened to you? Have you seen my life? Aside from that one night, have you ever seen me before?

 nbsp;

**Sarah**: No.

 nbsp;

**Sarah**: I gotta go. Im really sorry.

 nbsp;

**Me**: I just need to know one last thing.

 nbsp;

Sarah: Ya?

 nbsp;

**Me**: Why were you laughing when you hit me?

 nbsp;

**Sarah**: U looked liek my cheatin ex. Thought u were him. Had 2 get him later.

 nbsp;

Sarah: Bye.

 nbsp;

And then she logged out, and unfriended me.

 nbsp;

***
**Update 2 (January 21rst 2015 - 11:33 p.m.)**

 nbsp;

I can't sleep...can't stop thinking about her. I'm going to try and find her tomorrow. I'll update you guys as soon as I find her.

 nbsp;

***
**Update 3 (January 22nd 2015  7:45 a.m.)**

 nbsp;

Guys, I'm in trouble.

 nbsp;

I tried to be the bigger man, really I did, but that searing anger inside came back. I promised myself never to feel that hatred again, but I couldnt stop it. I couldn't stop myself.

 nbsp;

As I was walking to work this morning, I kept my eyes peeled for Sarah. I had a hunch Id be seeing her again. Sure enough, I spotted her bright pink jacket from a mile away. My leg was killing me, so I had trouble catching up to her this time. I finally managed to reach her when a passing bus cut her off.

 nbsp;

"Sarah!", I shouted, waving to her.

 nbsp;

She looked a little freaked out, and I cant blame her. I lifted my hands in the air to show her I meant no harm, which seemed to put her at ease. I explained to her that I needed closure, and that I just wanted to talk. I invited her back to my place, and, much to my surprise, she agreed to come.

 nbsp;

The walk to my apartment was awkwardly silent, and more awkward still when she walked through the threshold. How do you host someone that nearly killed you---on *purpose*? I motioned for her to sit down on the table, while I prepared coffee and got some stale croissants from the pantry. I should have done the groceries last night. Once the coffee was ready, I handed her a cup, and sat down in front of her.

 nbsp;

"What I really want to know ishave you ever seen MY life or not?", I asked her again.

 nbsp;

She was quiet, sipping her coffee while keeping her eyes downcast. Why was she avoiding my question? She owed me the truth, so I asked again.

 nbsp;

"Listen, y'know. Whatever the answer is, I wont be mad. I just want to know, thats all. It's all good if you didnt.", I reassured.

 nbsp;

Sarah frowned and shuffled uncomfortably in her chair. I couldn't imagine what this meeting must have been like for her. Then, she shook her head and said no. As soon as that word escaped her lips, I feltintense anger. I hadn't felt like that in a long time.

 nbsp;

"That's not possible!!", I howled, slamming my palm against the table.

 nbsp;

My dog ran into the room and started barking at me, like he had never done before. He'd never shown ANY kind of aggression towards me in the past. His constant nagging growls and barks made my head spin. Before I even knew what had happened, I was on my feet and reaching for Sarah, my hands gripping around her throat. I could feel her pulse through my fingertips.

 nbsp;

"DO YOU SEE IT NOW!? Do you see my life flashing before YOUR eyes now!?!?!? DO YOU SEE THE PAIN YOU CAUSED ME!?", I screamed at her.

 nbsp;

In that moment, something weird occured. I felt as though this had happened to her before. The first time her life flashed before my eyes, I hadnt seen her boyfriend chocking her like this, yet I was seeing it now. I was both myself, holding her tiny twig-like neck between my fingers, and her, being chocked while her boyfriend stood over her in a fit of rage. I was having trouble breathing, just like she was. Blood started dripping on her face, and I realized it was coming from my nose. Sarah stopped moving.

 nbsp;

She stopped moving.

 nbsp;

**Update 4 (January 22nd, 2015  8:30 a.m.)**

 nbsp;

I didnt know what to do, so I went to work, acting like everything was normal. I don't know what to do. It's like the floodgates are open now. Every stranger I bump intoit'sit's overwhelming. I can see all of them...My head hurts so bad

 nbsp;

**Update 5 (January 22nd, 2015  9:45 a.m.)**

 nbsp;

She's buried in the garden. I'm sorry. Oh god, I'm sorry. 




 Yes! I think that was it. I remember it had "Deep" in it. Every time I tried Googling it, all I got back was Deep Impact. 




 The Disappearance of Ashley, Kansas. *Shivers* 




 Horror movies don't typically scare me or make me lose any sleep, but there were two scenes in one movie I saw when I was a kid that absolutely terrified me.

I don't remember the titlebut it was a bunch of people on a cruise ship getting attacked by giant slugs. At some point, a dude gets acid slime on him and looks in shock at his hand that has this huuuge gaping hole through which you could see his bones, then the camera shifts to his faceand you see half of it has been melted off.

Worst than that, though was the bathroom scene. Oh, man. This poor woman needed to go, and when she sat down one of the slugs sucked her in through the toilet. I avoided the bathroom at night for YEARS after watching that. 




 That artworkwow. It gets my stamp of approval. 




 That's beautiful. I'm sorry for your loss, but I'm glad you got to spend time with your father. I'll be sending good thoughts you way. 




 You don't need to join me. *I'm already there with you.* 




 Waityou meanHuman Gravy ISN'T your real name?! 




 I name all my pens, and stick googly-eyes on them. There's Robert, Jacob, Felix, Captain Mc.Flufferpants, and Sammy. 




 My characters tend to spastically slap themselves in the face repeatedly whenever they meet someone new, which is exactly what I do IRL. 




 I am not a social man, and I have had few friends in my life. Sal, the bartender at my favorite pub, was one the select few in my inner-circle. I know what youre thinking: hes a bartender, he HAS to be friendly to get a good tip. Youre wrong, it goes beyond that. Id known Sal for over 25 years, and sat across from him at the bar almost every day since we met. When I got married, Sal was my best man. When my wife threw me out, its at Sals home that I stayed. When she took full custody of my daughter, it was Sal who consoled me. He was a good friend, always willing to listen to me and give me advice, like any bartender would. Unlike the other tenders; however, Sal actually cared.

 nbsp;

Now, Sal was a very private man with a rather quiet demeanor. That said, on the few occasions where he chose to let loose, he talked a LOT. Sal had a way of capturing the attention of everyone in the room. This might sound a bit clichd, but hed regale us with stories of his youth. He told us about his cross-country trips, his overseas adventures, his mishaps, and his entertaining anecdotes. When he spoke, his audience sat on the edges of their seats, hanging on his every word as he gave them the juicy details of his endless tales. He was old now, and couldn't travel quite as often. He didn't seem to mind: he always had a smile on his face and a cheerful attitude that brightened the mood of everyone he came across.

 nbsp;

One evening, as I was enjoying a drink, I noticed a man in a booth staring at Sal from across the room. At my angle, I could barely make out his short and spiky raven hair. I pointed him out to Sal, and he told me hed been coming in every night that week, never ordering anything. Sal, being the big softie that he was, couldn't bring himself to kick the guy out. Considering I went to the pub every night, I was surprised I hadn't seen the stranger until that evening. I was probably too drunk to notice.

 nbsp;

Later that night, after drinking one too many drinks---as I tended to do all too often, according to my ex-wife--- I passed out across a row of chairs. Sal trusted me enough to leave me there, even after closing time. I woke up long before dawn, and made my way through the dimly-lit bar to the backdoor, which could only be opened from the inside. This wasn't my first time taking a snooze alone in the bar, so I knew my way around well enough not to run into any of the tables on my way out.

 nbsp;

As I opened the door to the back alley, I heard what sounded like applause, but it turned out to be the sound of three dozen crows taking flight. They hovered above the cold alleyway for a few moments, and then landed on and around the leaky dumpster in the front. I jumped when I saw the damned birds. I'm not afraid of crows, mind you. I even feed the ones at work during lunch. They startled me, is all. A hunters moon peeked through the clouds and illuminated the scene: there was someone standing on the other side of the dumpster, in the forest of crows. It was the man I had seen earlier that night. He had his back turned to me, wearing a black trench coat and boots laced with multiple buckles. There was a large crow perched on his shoulder. Something was odd about his back: a bulky mass moved under his coat, causing it to shift around like curtains in the breeze.

 nbsp;

The dumpster smelled particularly putrid tonight, I thought. I glanced at the stranger, who stood between me and the street. I moved towards him and saw that his crow was chewing on something. At first, I thought it was a gummi worm, but as I approached, I realized it was much darker and oozed crimson blood onto the cold, wet pavement. Then, I saw Sal. He lay on the ground, his body ripped open, serving as a buffet for the hungry crows to feast on. They pecked at his innards, taking turns chewing on his softer organs. I could hear the crunching sounds as they broke apart his bones with their abnormally strong beaks. Bringing a hand to my mouth, I emitted an audible gasp. The sound caught the strangers attention, and he slowly turned to face me. His golden, serpentine eyes reminded me of headlights. Something in his left hand gleamed in the moonlight: it was a short silver dagger, the edge covered in liquid that belonged in my friend's veins.

 nbsp;

I should have been terrifiedangrysadbutI felt strangely calm. My eyes were transfixed on the surreal scene and the man at the center of it all. Though he held a weapon, and though he had used that weapon to murder my friend, I did not feel as though I was in any danger. The man gave me the quiet smile of a Grecian statue, projecting calmness despite the feeding frenzy at his feet. His footsteps echoed down the narrow alley as he made his way towards me. My heart thumped hard in my chest. Paralysed with fear or disbelief, I watched him outstretch a hand to my face, with a gentle elegance seldom attributed to the male gender. The crow on his shoulder tilted its head as its master scraped his long black nails against my cheek. I felt a faint stinging sensation, no worse than that of a paper cut. The man gave me an amused hum as he brought his fingers to his mouth and tasted a few drops of my blood.

 nbsp;

I'm not sure how long it took me to snap out of the shock, but when I finally did, I looked towards Sals final resting place, and saw that there was nothing left of my old friend, not even a drop of blood. The stranger turned his back to me, and a sudden flood of adrenaline compelled me to grab a wooden plank from the floor. I threw myself towards the man, but stopped all of a sudden, when his trench coat slid off. Two massive black wings clutched to his back like climbing vines. Black veins lead to and from the appendages, which flared out with a sound similar to that of an unfurling sail. The man gave me one final look, and spoke to me in a deep, booming voice. "Youll thank me one day.", he said. With that, the crows took flight, and the man disappeared. I was left alone in the alleyway as the sun rose: no evidence of the man, his crows, or my dead friend.

 nbsp;

I tried going to the cops, but what could I tell them? I sat in front of the police station, going over the facts in my mind. Theyd never believe that some sort ofcrow-demon and his army of minions ate Sal. I ultimately chose inaction, hoping Id merely suffered a booze-induced nightmare. It was no nightmare: Sal was reported missing by the pubs owner a few days later. An investigation began, and what the police uncovered shocked even me, who had seen a guy get eaten by a flock of crows. They found evidence linking Sal to no less than 15 cases of missing children. He had kept trophies of their remains hidden in a safe under his bed. Then it hit me: the reason for Sals frequent trips in his youth. Hed been doing the wretched deed far from home so he wouldn't get caught.

 nbsp;

This may sound weird, but I am still grateful for Sals friendship. As I explained earlier, I'm not a very social man. When you get to be over 20, it becomes a lot harder to meet people outside of work, and the friends you do have tend to drift away. Sal helped me through tough times, and Ill always be thankful for his friendship. I still mourn himnotthe bad parts. I mourn the loss of the man I thought he was. It may seem strange to youbut thats how I feel. These days, I've stopped drinking. I havent set foot in that pub since the day Sal died. My ex and I even got back together. I get to see my kid every day, and that is the greatest gift of all. I guess in a way, losing Sal was one of the best things that ever happened to me.

 nbsp;

On my way home from work yesterday, I saw a crow with familiar snake eyes gleaming like headlights. He gave me a knowing nod, and I knew we understood one another. Among the horrific things found in Sals home, they had retrieved a fully-packed duffel bag, a single one-way ticket to Mexico for the day after he was killed, and hundreds of photos of my wife and daughter. The crow man saved them. And that, my friends, is why I smiled to that crow and uttered two simple words: "Thank you." 




 Holy cow, man. I hope you'll find a way to cope with the loss. 




 *Hands the Datha-nathor a feather boa, a top hat, and a flute.* 




 I couldn't take the calls any more. I just couldn't take *knowing*. There was nothing I could do to stop them from coming through; I had to put an end to it.

 nbsp;

It all started this summer, when I was playing with my oldest daughter, Chrissie. My kid absolutely loved toy cars, so I had given her my Matchbox collection, which Id kept in the attic since my childhood. She was driving some farm animal around on the hood of my most prized possession: a classic fire truck with all its original parts and an unblemished paint job, when she suddenly stopped our caravan halfway to Mount Marshmallow Snowflakes, also known as the white leather sofa in the corner.

 nbsp;

"Daddy.", she said, her voice sweet and innocent.

 nbsp;

"Yes, honey?", I replied.

 nbsp;

"Daddy, dont answer the phone.", she told me.

 nbsp;

Having not heard my phone ringing, I wasn't sure what she meant by that. She had probably seen the screen on my Smartphone lighting up from an incoming call. I had a tendency to forget to un-mute the thing after meetings at the office. I guessed that Chrissie didn't want our playtime to end, so I assured her daddy wasn't going anywhere, and left the phone alone. She smiled, and we continued our game. Later, I checked my call history, but discovered that there hadn't been any incoming calls. I didn't really give it much thought, to be honest.

 nbsp;

A few weeks later, the same thing happened while we were playing doctor and giving Mr. Fuzzy Wuzzy his annual check-up. Chrissie looked up towards the kitchen and dropped her stuffed bear.

 nbsp;

"Daddy, dont answer the phone.", whispered Chrissie, in a frightened tone.

 nbsp;

This time, I chose not to heed her warning. I got up to check my Smartphone right away: no incoming calls. Following Chrissies gaze, I realized that she was actually looking at the old telephone on the kitchen wall. We had disconnected the landline and unplugged it years ago. My wife had been asking me to take it down since the day Id cancelled our residential phone services. We had both gotten cellphones and wanted to put the money towards something more useful. The bulky white device was screwed into the wall. I kept forgetting to dismount it whenever I had my tools out, and I was too lazy to get them from the garage for such a menial task. I'm shocked my wife didn't wind up removing it herself, since it bothered her so much.

 nbsp;

"Honey, thats not a real phone. No ones calling.", I told Chrissie, ruffling her hair.

 nbsp;

It took Chrissie a few moments, but she eventually went back to playing as though nothing had happened. It was probably some kind of new game she had learned in school or something. She was seven, and had a bunch of imaginary friends. Maybe shed gotten into an argument with Princess Pufflecakes, and she didn't want to take her call. I didn't worry about it too much.

 nbsp;

It wasnt until the third imaginary call that I started to get concerned. Chrissie and I were having a Ninja Turtles Tea Party. I was dressed in a pink tutu with Michelangelos bandana and a crown on my head ---*never* underestimate what a father would do to put a smile on his kids face--- and got up to get more juice. Chrissie grabbed me by my frilly skirt, looking absolutely terrified.

 nbsp;

"Daddy, dont answer the phone.", she pleaded.

 nbsp;

There was something in her eyes that compelled me to put an end to her weird game. She really looked freaked out: I no longer thought she was playing some kind of reverse-psychology Simon Says. If she was making it up, why did she look genuinely worried?

 nbsp;

"It might be important, squirt. Dont worry. Daddy will tell those evil telemarketers to leave you alone.", I playfully replied as I snuck out of her grasp.

 nbsp;

I made my way to the kitchen, where I picked up the receiver, and turned towards my daughter to give her a reassuring thumbs-up. Bringing the receiver to my ear, I fully expected to hear silence. Silence, however, was not what I heard. There was static on the line, which surprised me enough that I pulled the phone away for a moment to look at it in disbelief. When I brought it back to my ear, I heard a voice on the other end.

 nbsp;

"232 Jeanne DArc Road, fire, 12.", whispered a man tonelessly.

 nbsp;

"What the fu---fudgesicles?", I answered, perplexed.

 nbsp;

My wife must have been playing a trick on me. She had probably convinced Chrissie to help her out so Id do my job and get rid of the phone. I immediately yanked the cord, and it came flying towards me, hitting me square in the face. I was stunned: it was far too loose to have been in the jack. When I asked my wife about it, she had no idea what I was talking about.

 nbsp;

The next morning, I absent-mindedly checked my emails while the news played in the background. There was a segment about a fire in an apartment complex. At first, I didn't pay it much attention, but then I heard the address: 232 Jeanne DArc Road. Twelve residents had perished in the inferno. I nearly dropped my #1 DAD coffee mug on the floor. I didnt know what to do. It was too late to call the police and tell them Id gotten a creepy warning call about the fire. Theyd think I was a nutter, or an attention-seeker. I took a moment to calm down and rationalize what had happened. It was just a very weird and very scary coincidence.

 nbsp;
 
Days later, I was playing Sudoku on the couch when Chrissie walked over, wearing a worried expression on her face.

 nbsp;

"Daddy, dont answer the phone.", she whimpered, tears in her eyes.

 nbsp;

Something in the pit of my stomach told me not to go, but I had to know. I made my way to the kitchen and picked up the receiver. This time, a British-sounding woman spoke to me through the disconnected phone.

 nbsp;

"15 Vanier Street, fire, 3.", she announced.

 nbsp;

Logically, youd think Id go to the police or fire station to tell them what was going to happenbut heres the thingI've watched the shows, so I know how these things pan out. You've got an attractive male protagonist who gets a forewarning, which is accurate: I won the most handsome daddy of the year award, as decided on by my very unbiased daughters on fathers day last year (I even have a trophy to prove it). The protagonist then tells the cops about his predictions. Naturally, the cops accuse *him* of being the perpetrator. They lock him up, but he gets out on some technicality, then rushes to the scene of the would-be crime and saves the day. He becomes a true hero in the eyes of everyone. Close curtains. Yeah, I'm not *that* guy. I'm not saying I'm a cowardbut, lookI've got two daughters to care for. I cant go putting myself in dangerous situations where I could realistically wind up dead. Instead, I bought a disposable phone and used it to call the police.

 nbsp;

In the past ten years, there have been a lot of suspicious fires in our city, leading police to suspect theres a pyromaniac on the loose. Thus far, he or she has burned down: a church, a postal office, an outdoor mall, and a smaller post office inside a mall. I'm going to let you take a wild guess as to what the police officer had to say when I warned him about the potential fire at 15 Vanier Street. If you guessed, "He accused you of being the pyromaniac and asked that you turn yourself in.", then you deserve a cookie, because thats exactly what happened. I hung up and tossed the phone in a trashcan across town. The next day, I watched as a news crew covered the story. The authorities had sent police officers to investigate what turned out to be an abandoned building. Three officers had gotten locked in the basement. A fire broke out, and none of them made it out. I felt guilty and powerless. If I hadn't warned them, the cops wouldn't have been in there, and no one would have died. It was my fault. I couldn't sleep a wink that night, the horrid feeling in my gut eating away at me.

 nbsp;

The process repeated over the course of the next few months. Chrissie would ask me not to answer the phone, Id pick it up, and Id hear a different voice speaking. Id be given an address, method of death, and amount of people killed. 89 Oosgrove Avenue, knife, 1. Mrs. Larkin had been stabbed to death during a home invasion. 60 Star Circle, gas leak, 10. The Campbells were enjoying a family reunion, and failed to notice the smell of rotten eggs. 79 Jean-Jacques Lussier, gun, 3. Maria, Jamie, and Alison were shot dead while walking home in the early hours of the morning, and so on and so forth, until I just couldn't take it any more. I remember all their names and faces: I saw them on the news reports. I think about them when I go to bed, knowing that there was nothing I could do to save them, but tormented by the fact that I didn't even try. Depression started to creep over me, and I could barely eat or sleep. My wife started to get worried, but I couldn't tell her: I was afraid shed be disappointed in me for my inaction, so I lied. I told her I was stressed out because of work.

 nbsp;
 
A few weeks ago, I had finally had enough. Unable to keep myself from answering these phantom calls, I decided there was no other option. I stormed into my garage, grabbed my tools, and desperately unscrewed the phone from the wall. As I held the device, I felt a wave of anger rush over me. This thingthis damned telephoneit had caused me so much grief. I took it to the driveway, and furiously smashed it into the concrete with a hammer until there was nothing left but dust and debris. When it was over, I cleaned the mess. The sensation of freedom was euphoric. My whole body tingled as my heavy burden lifted from my shoulders. That night, I made our favourite family meal and dessert to celebrate. My wife was relieved that I had gotten over what ever it was that had been bothering me, and overjoyed that the eyesore in the kitchen had finally been removed.

 nbsp;

I have a piece of advice for you. If you have a disconnected landline and havent gotten around to removing it, please take a lesson from me: get rid of it immediately and, above all else, do NOT pick up the receiver.

 nbsp;

My life has returned to normal since I got rid of the wretched phone. As I am typing this, my wife is giving our youngest daughter a bath. I can hear them singing the bubble bath song and giggling. Chrissie is in the living room with me. Shes playing with this silly pink Disney phone. Its one of those fancy schmancy glittery toys: a pimped out version of the Fisher Price rotary phone I used to have when I was a kid. Every dial projects a message from one of the Disney Princesses. Its weird, shes never shown any interest in it before. Its not a real phone: it doesn't even have a cordbuttheres that look in her eyes again. Shes worriedI know what she wants to say. No: its just a toy. Its just a toy. Its just a toy, butIm going to check. I need to know





Shit. Shit. Shit. I can hear static on the other end.





I-its a mans voice...Hes sayingits my addressp-propane explosion4





I need to get my girls out of here. Pleaseplease dont let it be too late 




 The tip of one of my fingers is slightly crooked (thanks a lot, dad's genes). So, naturally, people IRL call me a heathen and a monster, and it's only normal for me to go out and try to eat them at night. I would therefore not mind it if my kind are portrayed that way.

In all seriousness, though. If the reader can't tell the difference between the opinions of your CHARACTERS versus YOUR opinions, then there's something wrong with THEM. 




 Good job, Ben! 




 It hasn't happened to me, but if it ever didit wouldn't bother me if the artist didn't ask permission. I would just hope that a. They link back to my story, and b. They tell me about it so I can gawk at the artwork and scream with joy. Unless said fan art was made using the real blood of the artist's victim. Then, I'd be screaming for a whole different reason. 




 Welp, I'm going to go curl up in the fetal position and cry myself to sleep now. 




 I love this story so much, I've actually listened to both the NoSleep Podcast version and the Chilling Tales for Dark Nights version.

...when you say "brought it to life", you mean the story...or the scarecrow corpse? DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN.

 Happy day of womb-expulsion! My two all-time favorites are:

It's from Library of Shadows instead of NoSleep, but it is so awesome. Words cannot describe the love I have for this one. 




 That's some pretty solid advice, o wise one. I think I, myself, will follow it, too. I tend to feel like an evil creative genius when I start to write. By the time I get to revisions, my confidence has gone down a few pegs but I typically still like the story. When I post it; however, I suddenly hate everything I write and feel like a complete fraud. And then I panic.

You're absolutely right: we write because we love to write. Sure, some stories are going to be hits and some will be misses, but that's life and those hours spent working on writing the stories were good, enjoyable hours. 




 Yeah. In hindsight, that tattoo of the green power ranger I got on my cheek was such a bad decision. I *knew* I should have gone with the blue one. 




 Of course. Was I not supposed to? I also promised him yours. Figured you wouldn't mind. You're all about the knees anyways, yeh? 




 My cat Dash got his name for typing a dash symbol on my keyboard a half dozen times.

Also: that screen name! Holy cow. Creepy!

 I can never get enough of horror podcasts. I will definitely be tuning in from now on.

I very shyly wonder if you'd be interested in [Do You Think It's Still Alive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2lpxo6/do_you_think_its_still_alive/)? 




 I wake face-first on the living room floor, my eyes greeting an unusual sight: an empty bottle of booze and a splatter of blood. It's morning, and I can smell alcohol on my breath. I jolt to my unsteady feet and wipe my drool-coated face on my sleeve. Hung-over, I check myself quickly for any obvious physical injuries that would explain the blood, but everything looks fine. I stagger to the bathroom and reach for a tissue, clearing my congested nose. No blood: the splatter wasnt from a nosebleed, thats for sure. Where did it come from? As I inhale, I notice a pleasant citrusy scent in the air. Does the house usually smell like lime?

 nbsp;

My head is throbbing with pain. Feels like a thousand sweaty construction men are jackhammering my skull. It hurts so bad that I use the wall for support as I head towards the kitchen. I know the key to nursing a hangover is to drink plenty of water. I reach for the fridge, but stop when I think to check my phone. Avoiding the blood splatter near the sofa, I extend a hand towards my cell, fully expecting a message from one of my drinking buddies calling me a motherfucker for getting into a brawl with him last night. Im sure thats how the splatter got there. Jimmy or Ramirez and I probably got into an argument about the fucking hockey game again, and I must have socked one of them in the face in my drunken stupor. To my surprise, I dont have any missed calls or text messages complaining about it. Huh.

 nbsp;

I take on the painstaking task of going to the kitchen again. My parched throat is begging for some hydration, but I hear a knock on the door before I can even reach my destination. I approach the window and peer outside. OH SHIT! OH SHIT! OH SHIT! Its the cops. Holy fucking shit. Was it Ramirez!? Is that Habs-loving asshole pressing charges!? I look at the blood splatter, and then and at the squad car. Shit. This doesnt look good at all. My pulse, as they say on ER shows, feels thready, like I ate one too many cheeseburgers. I cant think. Theres so much noise in my head. Feels like my brains about to implode. How could he call the cops over a stupid drunken argument? Sleezeball. Ever since he graduated from law school, hes been such a stickler for the rules.

 nbsp;

The doorbell rings.

 nbsp;

Theres no time to clean up the mess. Im just going to have to deal with it. If they book me, they book me. I open the door.

 nbsp;

"Good morning, sir.", says the officer in a chipper tone.

 nbsp;

Who the fuck gave this guy the right to be so cheerful at this ungodly hour? Its barely 8:30, for crying out loud! I keep telling myself to be polite. I force a smile and step aside to let him enter when he asks to come in. At first, neither he nor his partner seem to notice the blood.

 nbsp;

"Were looking for a boy. About 12 years old.", he tells me.

 nbsp;

That cant be right. II would never hurt a kid. Panic starts to set in, and I frantically step towards the living room, hoping the cops are going to leave. The partner seems to notice my movement, and nods towards the living room. Both cops look at the blood. I start babbling incoherently about being innocent, begging them to believe that I would never kidnap or hurt a child. I loosely explain that I smacked a friend in the face the night before and that its his blood. Its not a complete lie, since even I dont know the truth. The expressions on their faces shift from serious, to confused, and back to serious.

 nbsp;

"Sir, Im afraid you misunderstoodwere not accusing you of kidnapping. The boy is a suspect. Were just questioning the neighbors to see if anyone witnessed something last night.", he reassured.

 nbsp;

"A suspect? What, did he TP someones yard?", I ask curiously, while a sense of relief washes over me.

 nbsp;

The cops explain that the boy flew off the handle and decapitated his parents. Daaaamn, remind me never to take a kids cellphone away from him. With morbid fascination, I ask about their heads, as I walk towards the kitchen for that bottle of water Id been planning to drink all morning. The officers give my living room a quick glance, and then follow slowly behind.

 nbsp;

"We found the dads head in their garage freezer. The momswellno luck yet.", one of them tells me.

 nbsp;

I open the fridge door and I throw up at my feet almost immediately. All things considered, my body feels a lot better now that Ive vomited, though I cant say the same for my psychological well-being.

 nbsp;
 
"I found the mom.", I say.

 nbsp;

Her lifeless head is on the top shelf, on a nest of blood-soaked rags, sitting between a carton of expired OJ and my cleaning products. There's a post-it note on her forehead that says:

 nbsp;

"U were waking up. Couldn't finish cleaning. Lol. BBL"

 nbsp;

I hope my insurance covers therapy, because when the shock wears off, I think I'm going to need it. 




 Just a friendly head's up: the hyperlink to "There's something inhumane south of Seattle if you want to go looking for it" incorrectly brings you to "The Girl in the Log" instead. 




 gWhen I was around seven years old, I had a hamster called Creamie. Did you pick up on the very subtle hint in her name? Yes, the noisy rodent was cream-colored. Every night, my mom brought her cage down to the basement to keep her midnight antics (Creamie's, not my mom's) from waking us. Creamie had been my companion for the better part of three months before she croaked, like hamsters are wont to do. Most parents are careful about how they announce the death of a beloved pet: they explain that it has gone to heaven, lie about it running away to join the circus, say it moved on to greener pastures, buy a replacement and hope their child doesn't notice the patch of black fur on its face that wasn't there before, etc. Not my mother, no. Mom liked to do things a little differently.

 nbsp;

"Honey, I need to talk to you.", mom said, as I ate my sugar-coated cereal.

 nbsp;

"Mmhmm?", I replied, unwilling to draw my eyes away from the cartoon playing on TV.

 nbsp;

"Its about Mrs. Cream.", she continued, getting Creamie's name wrong for the millionth time.

 nbsp;

Mom reached for the remote control and turned off the TV to get my full attention. It always annoyed me how she interrupted my shows with no regards for my feelings. I had learned from experience not to do the same to her when I wanted attention. Id once turned off Quantum Leap during the season finale, and she flipped out. As punishment, she took away my Polly Pocket toys for a week.

 nbsp;

"Yeah?", I asked, trying not to sound annoyed, so I wouldn't get scolded for giving her attitude.

 nbsp;

"Im sorry dear, but Mrs. Cream got eaten by the monster in the furnace.", she announced, without hesitation.

 nbsp;

Mom knew exactly how frightened I was of the large metallic furnace in the basement. Every time it shifted on, it released an intimidating and demonic gurgle. To make matters worse, it continually emitted a sinister red light, like some kind of a Disney movie villain. I swear, even now that I'm older, Im afraid of going anywhere near it. If I wasn't sufficiently scared of the furnace before she told me about the monster, I sure as heck wanted to steer clear of it afterwards.

 nbsp;

Reading the fear on my little face, my mother smiled and continued:

 nbsp;

"Oh, didnt I tell you about the monster in the furnace? Its a dreadful beast. When it gets loose, it grabs sleeping little girls that dont cover their feet and drags them under the bed, where it eats them in a single mouthful. We moms have to keep our kids safe by feeding it your pets from time to time instead.", she explained.

 nbsp;

Needless to say, I was unable to take another bite of cereal, and dropped my spoon into the bowl. While I gazed at my mom wide-eyed, I could feel myself trembling with fear. She was an adult; there was no reason for her to lie to me. I knew I was going to have nightmares. Through a flurry of terrified thoughts, I wondered what would happen now that I no longer had a pet to sacrifice to the creature. Would it come after me tonight? I rarely tucked my feet under my blanket: I liked to let them dangle off the edge of my bed. Was I going to have to use a sleeping bag to stay safe? A question popped out of my mouth before I even had a chance to process the thought:

 nbsp;

"W-what ddoes it look like?", I asked my mom, not really wanting to hear the answer.

 nbsp;

She smirked wickedly, and abandoned me to retrieve a box of animal index cards shed bought to help me learn French. I was left alone with my imagination, which filled in the gaps and made the monster even more terrifying. I kept looking at the floor, expecting to see the unknown creature scurrying about the black-and-white linoleum kitchen tiles. Mom returned, and began flipping through the index cards until she found the ones she was looking for. She turned two of them towards me: a scorpion, and an anglerfish.

 nbsp;

"It looks like a combination of these.", she told me. "Its about the size of a cat. Its body is similar to this scorpion here, but longer and with more feet, and it has a head like this, but with three rows of fangsand eight eyes."

 nbsp;

The creature sounded more and more horrific by the minute. I could picture it skittering about the basement and trying to grab me while I played alone down there. Blood drained from my face and hands. I felt like crying, but somehow the fear kept my body paralyzed, and tears did not flow.

 nbsp;

"Whawhat are we going toto do? I-I dontI dont wanna be eaten", I stuttered, on the brink of despair.

 nbsp;

My mother gave me a small, reassuring smile.

 nbsp;

"Dont worry, honey, Ill go buy a guinea pig later today in case it gets hungry again.", she answered, sounding quite satisfied with herself.

 nbsp;

And that, my friends, is how my mother kept me from feeling sad about the death of my hamster, and the many pets that came after it. Though there is one thing that always bothered me: I still dont know how she managed to get rid of all their bodies so fast.

 I get up at 6:00 a.m. Eastern time and start working between 7:00-7:15 a.m. by choice. I prefer working earlier (while no one is around) and getting to leave earlier than facing traffic.

I was kind of wondering if everyone up in the morning here were from other time zones. 




 Thank you bot! : } 




 *Steps away from Kneeod slowly* 




 Well, someone came in on a load of turnips, huh?

I'm no psycho-analyst, but one would argue that if horror scares you, it's because you're able to identify with the protagonist and, y'know, EMPATHIZE with him/her. (Jump scares aside, that is.)

Thanks for the link. I had a good laugh. 




 Maybe she meant the Avatar: The Last Airbender movie, which was horrifically bad. 




 Note to self: bring padding. 




 I think I will! I'll learn as I go.

Quick question: does anyone bite? 




 Sadly, I have no idea what this is. When ya'll posted about it a few weeks ago, I tried to find the original post explaining it, but failed. Then food distracted me. 




 "Pay no attention to the corpse in the back.", said the professor, as we entered his classroom.

 nbsp;

Thats how my second term Biology class started. I was in University, fresh off my winter break and mourning end of a good holiday season. I had stayed on campus and spent my time getting drunk with my buddies. The fun was over, and it was time to get back to studying. I had looked up my bio teacher, Mr. Blackburn, on Rate My Professor the night before, yknow, to know what to expect. His reviews were underwhelming: the guy was apparently a total bore. Students said he was monotone, never joked, and never cracked a smile. Thats why I was surprised at the state of the corpse in the back of the room. Mr. Blackburn didn't strike me as a funny man, but I guessed he must have had a bit of a devious streak in him.

 nbsp;

The body had been placed behind a row of discarded tables and broken chairs. It sat on a sturdy wooden crate, wearing a civil-era uniform. There was a sombrero on its head and a pine air freshener dangled around its neck like a lame gangsta medallion. Again, I didn't peg Mr. Blackburn to be the kind to joke around. Maybe the old coot had grown a sense of humor, or maybe hed lost his marbles overnight. Either way, this being Biology class and all, I figured the body was there for a reason other than giving us a good laugh. I squinted and examined the corpse. It looked old. I dont mean it was decomposing, mind you. Heck, it was so well-preserved that it didn't even emit an odor. I mean the person it used to be was an old man. Its skin was shrivelled up and mummified-looking. Its arthritis-ridden arms stretched out at sinister angles that reminded me of tree branches in the dark. I looked at its face and saw its mouth and eyes were wide open, giving it an appearance of shock and terror. Man, must have been a rough death.

 nbsp;

Mr. Blackburn started the lecture. He certainly lived up to his reputationand by that, I mean, I fell asleep after ten minutes of hearing him drone on and on. In fact, I cant recall a single lecture that didn't end with me dozing off.

 nbsp;

After class, the other students and I exchanged theories about the corpse and why it was there. Over the next few weeks, we started to notice that someone, presumably Mr. Blackburn himself, changed the body slightly between classes. Trying to figure out what the prof had done to it became our new pastime. Sometimes, its arm had been repositioned, other times, it was several feet away from its starting position. Even its eyes could, at times, be spotted looking in a different direction. The corpse became our creepily awesome mascot. Whenever Mr. Blackburn caught us looking at it; however, he would clear his throat to draw our attention to the front, and repeat what he had told us on the first day:

 nbsp;

"Pay no attention to the corpse in the back.", hed say slowly, his voice colder and harsher.

 nbsp;

It was weird, because he had this gleam in his eyes whenever he told us not to look at it. I swear, it was like he was taking pleasure out of knowing we were peeking. He had the exact same look a toddler has when he drops his trousers in front of a group and lets loose on the carpet, knowing hes doing something wrong but relishing the moment anyways. There was something off about Mr. Blackburn.

 nbsp;
 
One snowy afternoon, Cynthia, a really hot chick that sat across from me, dropped her pen. It rolled to the back of the class and stopped right between the corpses feet. She sighed loudly, looking more annoyed about having to get up than frightened to approach the body. Now, Id been pining over Cynthia since the start of the semester, so it was only natural that I turned my head to check out her fine behind as she bent down to pick up her pen. She suddenly shrieked like a harpy, and I knew exactly why.

 nbsp;

"HES STILL ALIVE!!", she yelled, confirming my suspicions.

 nbsp;

The class erupted in laugher, assuming she was playing some sort of trick. I knew better: I had seen it move, too. Its foot had twitched ever so slightly when she reached for the pen. I even saw its contorted fingers barely outstretch, as if trying to grab her but not having enough strength to do so. I overheard someone making a joke about the stiff trying to check out her rack. I was too freaked out to respond. Cynthia threw the pen at the body and ran out of the classroom, frantically dusting herself as though there were bugs all over her. The class erupted in indiscernible chatter. Upon hearing all the commotion, the teacher stopped his lecture. He calmly turned his attention to the corpse, and then to the rest of us.

 nbsp;

"Class dismissed.", he said, in a calm and unaffected tone.

 nbsp;

Mr. Blackburn straightened his papers, collected his things, and calmly exited the classroom without another word. His nonchalance seemed to put the room at ease. Had the other students seen what Cynthia and I had seen, I'm not sure they would have left the room cheering about their good fortune. I overheard someone say the teacher had probably rigged the body with electrodes or something to cause it to jerk. I wanted to check, because I wanted it to be true. Still, as the mass of students barrelled towards the door, I felt compelled to follow and leave with them, like a mindless lemming. In hindsight, I regret not examining the body before I left.

 nbsp;

The next day, the corpse was gone, and it wasn't the only thing missing: Mr. Blackburn didn't show up for class. The old man never returned to school. No letter of resignation, nothing. The police was eventually called to investigate, but found no traces of him. After an internal investigation, the school discovered that massive amounts of powerful anaesthetic and embalming fluids were missing from the storage room.

 nbsp;

As I passed through the hallway near the Deans office a few days later, I saw a plaque with the pictures of all the schools faculty members. Whoever it was that had been teaching our Biology class for weeks wasn't Mr. Blackburn. No, wrinkly old Mr. Blackburn looked a lot more like what we thought was just a corpse in the back. 




 Well, I'm never listening to the radio again without headphones. 




 Human souls? I have a few of those around. 




 In accordance with the prophecy, I am glad this suggestion pleases you. 




 I never noticed it in my own writing until someone pointed it out. It was then that I began making a conscious effort to eliminate the problem.


You could always do something I read somewhere a long time ago: preface every single sentence with "In accordance with the prophecy.", both in your writing and in real life.


"Hey, Suspense304, what's for dinner?"


"In accordance with the prophecy, baked beans and the tears of lambs." 




 My heart is a flutter with dreams of the butler,

He makes my soul utter words of desire,

Oh how I shutter when I sense him nearer,

The way he helps others, makes me stutter,

I l-l-lo-love y-you, y-you handsome b-butler.


Whats that? N-no. I don-I dont have a massive man-crush on the butler. S-shut up. Its PERFECTLY NORMAL for a man to write a romantic poem for someone else. Shhh. Nothing weird here. Nope. 




 How about getting paid in Timbits? 




 Zoom and enhance!

Wait...there's no need to zoom.

Good god, that is freaky.

The Scarecrow Corpse. It was a good one. Really gave me the chills. 




 The Petitcodiac River, which passes through Moncton New Brunswick, is said to be haunted. The locals refer to it as the Chocolate River, not because of the fancy chocolatier shop on its south bank, but because heavy sediments in the water have turned it a permanent shade of brown. In 1968, a causeway was built in an attempt at controlling the flow of water to prevent flooding in agricultural areas, and to connect Moncton to its neighboring town, Riverview. Up until then, the Chocolate River was home to one of the largest tidal bores on earth, and had an ecosystem rich in marine life. After construction, the river died down to a trickle, and 85% of the creatures died. The locals urged the government to open the causeway doors in order to restore the river to its former glory. It was not until 2010 that the doors were finally open for good. The river began a slow healing process, and marine life gradually returned. Unfortunately, the restoration project came with a little something extra: something sinister joined the wildlife of the chocolate-colored river.

 nbsp;
 
In Fall of 2013, I flew to Moncton to visit my sister for a week. She and I had been best friends since childhood, but our lives had taken us on different paths, and, a few years prior, she moved for work. We kept in touch through video calls and weekly chat sessions. She told me how friendly the people of Moncton were. It was the kind of town where everyone knew you and your relatives by name, even if you had never met. Everyone was polite and lived a nice, quiet life. From my sisters descriptions, an image of a quaint little village formed in my mind. Imagine my surprise when, upon arriving in Moncton, I found a full-blown city. Though un-obscured by skyscrapers, Moncton was full of grocery stores, highways, malls, government and university buildings, etc. It was nothing like what I imaged. I was shocked to see how big Moncton was. My sister picked me up from the airport, and we drove back to her apartment just in time for supper. We spent the evening catching up and geeking out in true sibling fashion.

 nbsp;
 
The next morning, my sister and I headed to her workplace. On the drive there, I spotted the Chocolate River. I expressed interest in checking out the tidal bore: a wave that climbed up a river against its current during high tide. My sister promised we could go the next morning. Having checked out the schedule the previous night, I knew the morning tide was going to come in at around 4:00 am, and had no desire to get up that early. We had no plans for the afternoon, so I asked if we could go watch the evening tidal bore instead, which came in at around 3:00 pm on that particular day. I remember her answer quite vividly, since it took me by surprise. She raised her eyebrows and shook her head quickly: Oh, no. Thats dangerous., she said. I pressed her on the issue, and she explained that there had been a lot of accidents where people had fallen in and drowned. I could not wrap my head around why the city had not built guardrails, or why the morning tide was supposedly safer than the evening tide.

 nbsp;
 
We arrived at my sisters place of employment with two boxes of donuts for her coworkers. After using the sweets to assemble the team, my sister paraded me around and introduced me to everyone. She had not exaggerated when she told me about their hospitality: they were extremely friendly and downright delightful. My sister left me with the group while she took care of some last-minute business. Her coworkers and I got to talking about the tidal bore. An older gentleman with greying hair and a bushy mustache warned me that the river was damned, and that those who watch the tidal bore three nights in a row get dragged under by the living dead, never to be seen or heard from again. He claimed their blood had turned the river brown over the years. At first, I laughed and dismissed it as playful folklore to scare an out-of-towner like me. He had probably told my sister another variation of the story. It was not like her to fall for silly tales, so I was kind enough not to tease her too much for believing in that superstitious nonsense. I banished thoughts of the Chocolate River from my mind and headed back home to play videogames my sister.

 nbsp;
 
By late afternoon on the following day, I asked my sister come with me to see the tidal bore, which took place at around 4:45 pm. She reluctantly agreed to take me, but abandoned me to buy treats at the chocolatier shop not far from where we parked. Careful not to slip on the rocks, I approached the muddy river and took a seat on a stable concrete slab protruding from the landscape. The cool autumn air and the strong breeze made me thankful that I had grabbed my leather jacket on the way out. My hands searched through its pockets until my fingers caught my cellphone. I checked the schedule, and smiled in anticipation: the tidal bore was going to come in any minute now. I waited patiently, head arched towards the end of the river, until I saw a wave on the horizon. As the water approached, I began hearing a dreadful sound. Some person or creature was groaning. I averted my gaze from the water for just a second to see what was making the noise. By the time I turned my head back, I felt a splash of cold, mucky water flooding my shoes. An audible yelp escaped my lips and I jumped to higher ground. I did not expect the river to swell quite that much. The wave continued its journey up the stream, taking the moaning sound away with it, and the water eventually evened out.

 nbsp;

That night, I did a bit of research on the Chocolate River. There had been no less than 9 cases of mysterious deaths and disappearances since the causeway doors had opened three years prior. Two of the victims were part of a camera crew getting preliminary shots for a documentary on the restoration of the Chocolate River. Their equipment washed up on shore several weeks later, so it was assumed they had drowned and that the river had fed their bodies into the Atlantic Ocean. Another case talked about a young photographer. A piece of his shirt, clinging to a boulder on the banks of the river, was all they ever found of him. Authorities speculated that the man, trying to get a nice photo, had slipped and fallen in. I remembered being taken by surprise by the volume of water that suddenly reached me when the tide came in, so I could understand how a couple of accidents might have happened. As I read through the articles, I began to paint an entirely different picture in my mind. There were only so many alleged suicides and accidents that could happen before it raised a couple questions, and I was shocked the authorities had done nothing about it.

 nbsp;

The next day, we drove to Hopewell Rocks, which was the meeting point between the Atlantic Ocean and the Chocolate River. Hopewell Rocks had almost made it on the list of 7 Natural Wonders of the World. I was enthralled by the beautiful landscape of massive water-eroded boulders. It was impressive to see the natural marks that perfectly outlined just how high the water could go. You could see sediments and rows of kelp clinging to the stones. I was standing under one of the boulders for a photo, and looked up to see that the water reached at least 5 feet over me during high tide. That was probably how the handprints had gotten up there. I noticed them around the highest edges of some of the larger boulders. They resembled ancient cave paintings, in that they were simple and lacked the kind of profanity you would expect from regular graffiti. I explored the beach in complete awe, examining every cavernous nook and cranny along the way.

 nbsp;

We got back in time for the next evening tide, which took place around 6:00 pm. This time, my sister joined me. I had packed us a couple sandwiches, which we ate while waiting for the show. I had chosen a spot on higher ground to avoid my running shoes getting flooded again. The first time was unpleasant enough. As time went on, the streets around us emptied and the sounds of the city faded away. It was not long before we began hearing strange noises. A chorus of agonized screams, howls, and groans erupted from every direction as the tide approached. I could see fear in my sisters eyes as she pointed towards the river. I followed her gaze, spotting dark shapes underneath the surface. Just like the ocean flooded the river, fear flooded every inch of me. I would have stayed frozen there, had my sister not grabbed me by the arm and pulled me to the car. I could still see something under the water as we drove over the causeway.

 nbsp;

On the third night, I returned to the Chocolate River alone: my sister was still freaked out about what we had seen and heard the night before. I got to the river early, and watched the sun slowly crawl towards the horizon, giving me very little light to observe the tide. It was due to come around 7:00 pm, but I did not let the lack of light deter me. I cautiously approached the river, sat down, and waited until I saw the vague outline of a wave in the distance. Again, moans and screams filled the air, this time louder than ever. I could see something sticking out of the wave as it rolled towards me. One by one, hundreds of muddied fingers reached through the waters surface. I only had time to see the fingers turning into hands before I remembered what that man had told me: the undead would drag me under if I watched the tidal bore three nights in a row. I pounced to my feet and staggered towards the car as quickly as my legs could take me. My foot hit a crack in the concrete and my ankle twisted harshly. The pain brought me to my knees, but when I turned around, I could see fingers reaching over the riverbank, and I forced myself back to my injured feet. I ran to the car, throwing the door open and slamming it shut in one rapid motion. I turned the car on and the headlights illuminated the river: I could see arms reaching over the edge. Tires shrieking, I high-tailed it out of there.

 nbsp;

I did not go back to the Chocolate River after that night. I spent what was left of the week in sisters apartment, trying hard to forget what I saw. On the plane home, I looked outside the window and saw the Chocolate River below. I swear, even from a distance I could see shadows under the surface. I cant help wondering: did the dead start inhabiting the river after the causeway doors opened, or was the causeway built to keep them out? 




 Too busy laughing about the beaver comment to come up with a good comeback. 




 The only pointy branches are the ones around my heart whenever you're away. ; D 




 *Sigh* How am I supposed to compete with that? You win, good sir. May your serious and meaningful long-term relationships with consensual ladyfolk be most fruitful. I can only hope that I will be as virile as you one day. 




 Can't say that I have, alcohol's not my thing.

But for you ladies out there: I have chugged an entire bottle of water once, without taking a breath. That's right, badass alert. 




 My Canadar alarms are blaring. Let us do a celebratory shot of maple syrup, my faithful companion. 




 I'd try replacing the photos with people you really don't like and see what happens. Maybe you can save your loved ones that way? 




 Have a happy and spooky New Year everyone! 




 You could switch to the lighter color scheme so that, on your next visit, you won't immediately know where you are. 




 The one about my car. 




 Read Roman numerals and read analogue clocks. It's ironic, because I have a beautiful grandfather clock with Roman numerals on it. I have no idea whether or not the time on it is accurate. 




 I agree: I got a 100$ bill once. Took me forever to get rid of it. 




 Everything is so black and white with this guy. 




 There's nothing wrong with implementing chunks of yourself in your stories: it helps breathe life into them. You shouldn't shy away from it. Besides, no one's going to know that you're using yourself in your story...unless it's someone who knows you out there in the 'real' world. 




 I half agree with you. I don't have a problem with people playing along per se, and I find some of the comments really entertaining, but I think two of the rules come into conflict with one another in such a way as to be really detrimental.

People have to **assume everything is real** and play along, but **people can't ask for proof**. If everything is real, then of course they're going to want proof. I wrote a story a few days ago about something caught on camera and a bunch of people asked for the video, which is only natural because the story is supposed to be real. I know they're not -supposed- to ask for the video, but they did, and I'm not a video-y person, so I provided no video footage.

I think it would be a step in the right direction to let people play around if they want to, but not FORCE them to assume everything is real if they don't. 




 I'm glad the story scared you! In the interest of being mysterious...ONE of the stories I have posted is 100% true. The rest are works of fiction. 




 The writer in me says: We've got some awesome readers here, which helps a lot!
The reader in me says: Heck yeah, the writers here impress me tremendously. 




 xD 




 Last year, on Boxing Day, I found a really cool ornament in a clearance box. It had a built-in camera to record a unique perspective on your holiday celebrations. I grabbed the last one from the stores dusty shelf and brought it home for less than 10 bucks. I forgot about it until my wife, my two daughters, and I decorated the house earlier this month. I told my daughters about the camera and said wed secretly catch Santa in the act. I had an old costume in the attic and intended to deliver some gifts in full view of the camera on Christmas night. My girls were overjoyed, and went back-and-forth trying to find the best place to put the ornament on the tree. They had no idea daddy re-positioned it later so it could actually catch the living room and a good angle.

 nbsp;

In the nights leading up to Christmas, I turned the camera on to make sure everything was working properly. In the morning, I previewed the footage---just long enough to confirm the thing was working. Satisfied, I inserted the Micro SD card back into the ornament, and slipped in a new battery in anticipation for the big night. Daddy didn't want to disappoint his girls with a failed recording.

 nbsp;

We enjoyed Christmas Eve as a family, playing board games and eating way more junk food than there was room in our stomachs. Like we do every year, we let our daughters open one gift from mommy and daddy before going to bed. The girls, still riding their sugar-high, could be heard giggling in their bedrooms from all the way up the stairs. From time to time, my wife and I could hear one of them shush the other, claiming shed heard hoofs on the roof or bells jingling. Eventually, our kiddos dosed off. My wife kissed me on the cheek and headed to bed while I turned off all the lights. I retrieved the costume and tiptoed to the living room, getting ready for my big feature film debut.

 nbsp;

I did everything you would expect Santa to do: I ate most of the cookies, I drank the milk, I pet my large stomach and said my HO HO HOs, and I dropped a few presents by the fireplace, all in full-view of the camera. A pretty good acting job, if I do say so myself.

 nbsp;

On Christmas morning, the girls came running into our bedroom to wake us up. They excitedly insisted we watch the video before opening the presents. I transferred the footage to my laptop, forwarded to where Santa showed up, and pressed play. My girls squealed with delight and jumped in front of the screen, frantically waving at Santa while obscuring the video from my view. It brought me so much joy to see how happy the girls were. I was too lazy to stop the video, so it continued to play in the background while we unwrapped out gifts. I spotted a box I had not seen the night before: it was a small and wrapped in a blue foil paper I did not recognize. My name was on it, but my wife seemed as surprised as I was to see it there. Noticing my confusion, my youngest daughter spoke:

 nbsp;

Daddy! Thats gotta be from Mr. Elf!, she said, her voice cheerful and bright.

 nbsp;

I was ready to dismiss her elf comment as just another weird thing kids say, but my wife wasn't so quick to ignore it.

 nbsp;

Honey, what elf?, she asked.

 nbsp;

My daughter pointed to the laptop. By then, the video had ended and all that was left on the screen was a preview of the first frame.

 nbsp;

The one that came with Santa!, she answered.

 nbsp;

Panic struck me like a bird in a jet propeller. I know my wife didnt dress up as an elf. I scanned the video, clicking forward and back until I saw what my daughter had seen: there was someone in the living room. He walked into the corner after I had turned the lights off. He stood there watching me parading around as Santa. The video went completely quiet after that. It was as though the camera failed to record a single sound. The strange, tall man in an elf costume stood perfectly still for over an hour, watching the camera from a distance. After a while, he walked over to the plate of cookies and bit the head off a gingerbread man. I glanced at the plate and saw his teeth mark on the decapitated cookie. The man then quietly approached the Christmas tree. I thought the audio wasn't working, but as he reached the tree, I began hearing his slow and steady breaths. He reached towards the ornament, and the video stopped.

 nbsp;

In a terrified frenzy, I grabbed the blue box hed left behind. I ripped the bow off of it and tossed the frilly thing away. I frantically removed the wrapping paper, opened the box, and looked inside. There, on a bed of bubble wrap, was the battery Id put in the camera the night before. My wife took the ornament and opened the back: the battery was missing. I dont know what scares me more: what the camera caught, or what the elf might have done after he turned off the camera. 




 As someone who has a 3DS, I find this unsettling. I think I'm going to keep a closer eye on who walks into my plaza from now on. 




 That chameleon is great, and that stamp is awesome!

My sister got me an alarm clock that imitates the sunrise. It's pretty dark in my room, so this'll make mornings a lot more cheerful. My current alarm clock is so old it actually has a cassette tape player integrated into it.

My parental units got me a bunch of cool stuff for my kitchen (including a potato ricer) and some DCU movies. Can't wait to watch Justice League: War with my sister. Never too old for Justice League! 




 Happy insert holiday here to you, too! :) 
























 I'm pretty used to the robotic voices because I often have to check websites for accessibility at work. I've never tried listening to a NoSleep story using Jaws or VoiceOver, though. 




 Congratulations, very well deserved. 




 Someone told me they were a fan. That totally made my day. But I have to say, pretty much any comment I receive makes me really happy. 




 Fantastic! I will definitely give it a read. 




 [The Worst Thing About Australia Is The Silence](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2sqe9k/the_worst_thing_about_australia_is_the_silence/)

There's just something about that title that gives me the creeps. 




 Theos god-awful, off-key, cat-strangling singing woke me up on the big day. I was spared the second half of his shower performance by leaving the dorm room to buy lukewarm coffee from the machine down the hall. Within the hour, we were out and headed to the airport in Theo's crapmobile. First class was balls to the walls awesome, even though Theo nearly got us thrown out for kicking the seat in front of us. It took a bit of his classic smooth talking, but we convinced the stewardess that Theo was suffering from terminal stage 5 Restless Leg Syndrome, and we got off the hook.


"Theodore Bishop and Markus Ryans?", called a smoking-hot babe, as we reached the luggage claim area.


Normally, Theo would have protested the use of his full name, but he was too busy gawking at the woman's plump red lips and tight body to notice. She congratulated us on winning the contest, and brought us to a limo waiting outside. An array of chocolate-covered strawberries and champagne waited on the back seat.


"Theo, you sure this aint a couples retreat?", I asked.


"Who cares? This shits free! Cmon. Lets have some champagne!", replied Theo, stuffing a bunch of strawberries down his gob.


The woman shut the passenger door, much to my disappointment, and headed to the drivers seat. I was hoping she'd join in on our celebration. Theo poured us  champagne, and we started drinking. Though I can typically hold my liquor, I started feeling kind of woozy after two glasses. It wasn't long before I passed out.


"Markus, shit. Wake up, man! I think we were drugged!", howled my buddy, giving me a firm open-hand slap to the face to stir me awake.


I groaned, grabbing my throbbing cheek. Theo looked as shitty as I was feeling. I had a huuuuuge hangover, the likes of which I had not felt since New Years '07. It took a moment for the reality to sink in, and for me to take in my surroundings. We were sitting in a patch of yellowing tall grass outside a run-down building covered in foliage. Its thick cement walls were grumbling apart, towering over us in an almost threatening manner. There was nothing but forest around us, and the sun was already setting. I couldn't find my phone or my luggage. I got up and spotted a massive faded sign that had fallen off the building. It read, in big bold letters: Grand Bay Hotel Miami. Under the name was something written in red spray paint, like graffiti: Grand re-opening! 




 Welcome back, bud! I miss the good times we used to share!

Write about how a haircut made you telekinetic? 




 CFU for LIFE, yo! I'd make us a logo, but I'm afraid it would look offensive. 




 First offouch.

Doesn't matter how it happened, though. I'm making you my honorary brother. We people-with-crooked-fingers have to stick together! 




 Green snakesRECYCLINGI see a pattern... 




 Thanks for the warm welcome! De-defending champion? *Gulp* N-no pressure, then?

Seriously, though. This is going to be fun. WUAHAHAHAHHAHAA. *Lightning strike* 




 Yay team!
I've got a question for you, 'Capt. This is my first round of NoSleep Teams. I read the Wiki, but I'm still a *tiny* bit confused. How do we know when it's our turn..?
(P.S. I am on your team, fearless leader!) 




 Are ya'll talking about the narrator that just kept doing fart noises the whole time? 




 I'm an early bird and always seem to get up at or around the same time every day regardless of how late I go to bed. Believe me, if I was physically capable of sleeping longer, I would. 




 I just got up because it's the weekend so I slept in. (8 am = sleeping in for this early bird)

I'm preparing my grocery list for the week. Exciting stuff. 




 I had nothing to do with his passing. It was a drunk driver. 




 Thanks for sharing. I'm both glad and sorry to hear that I'm not the only one dealing with these kind of issues. I'll try your advice, thank you.

As for your storymaybe you should write it. I found that writing this helped me come to terms with my condition. There's something cathartic about putting your thoughts on paper (or on a Word document, in this day and age). 




 Urgh, I can never reach you. Always right in the middle of my back. 




 I'm pretty average in all departments. Average height, brown hair, eyes that change color depending on the weather and/or what I wear, strong cheekbones, allegedly normal nose. (Though I sometimes use my face for reference when drawing stuff, and people keep telling me the nose looks weird.)

The only thing that's non-typical is my middle finger, which is kind of crooked at the top. I inherited that feature from my dad. 




 They booed me the whole time. 




 I would like to submit [I thanked the man who murdered my only friend](

Thank you! 




 What if a third bump makes them even worse? I'm not sure I could deal with that... 




 Huh, I never thought of that. I have tried a few meditation techniques (without success). Maybe I should give them a taste of their own medicine. 




 This is going to sound like a farce, but ever since I suffered a concussion last summer, I've been hearing a live studio audience around me 24/7. The doctors reassured me they were merely auditory hallucinations brought on by the bump to my noggin, and that they'd eventually go away on their own once my brain healed. It was actually kind of funny at first. I mean, once I got over the initial shock and fear of hearing the unsolicited reactions of a bunch of strangers. They started off more entertaining than disturbing, but that balance eventually shifted, and I'm afraid of them now.

 nbsp;

The very first time it happened was the day I was discharged from the hospital. It was a beautiful August day, and I was psyched to finally go out in the warm sun. Eric, my boyfriend, picked me up from the hospital to take me back to our apartment. I was in high spirits, despite a persistent headache, which had followed me since the bike accident. (Kids, wear your helmets!) Eric made a joke, and suddenly, a flurry of hysterical laugher came flooding in from every corner of the car. I screamed at Eric to turn off his surround sound system, covering my ears to drown out the noise, but the laugher only got louder. I could tell by the freaked-out look in Eric's eyes that he hadn't been playing a practical joke on me. Once the chuckles subsided, I explained what happened. Eric turned the car around and drove me straight back to the medical facility.

 nbsp;

A brain scan, a few blood tests, and countless hours later, the doctors assured me it was a harmless side-effect of the concussion, and not a case of sudden onset schizophrenia, as I had feared. It was perfectly normal. Well, as normal as hearing a room full of easily-entertained spectators could be. They told me to go home and rest.

 nbsp;

It took me a few days to adjust to the auditory hallucinations, but I eventually started to see the humor in my predicament. Meetings at work were a lot more entertaining, what with the peanut gallery projecting annoyed groans whenever my boss slipped into a boring tangent. I didn't even have to secretly roll my eyes: the voices in my head were the perfect vessel through which I could express my innermost feelings without getting in trouble. At home, my captive audience laughed at each of my jokes, even when Eric failed to react to the punch line. When I went to bed, they'd "awwww" as I wrapped my arms around Eric, and again when my cat curled up between us for warmth. The voices even became a sort of early-detection system, warning me of unseen dangers through a series of suspenseful gasps.

 nbsp;

It started going downhill about two months ago, when I was taking a shower alone in my apartment. Eric was out of town that night, and I had this lingering fear that I'd forgotten to lock the front door. As I was pouring conditioner into the palm of my hand, I heard the studio audience gasp in fear. It startled me enough that I spilled the coconut-scented beauty product near my feet. My spectators continued to breathe in in a stressed manner that suggested I was about to get attacked by a psycho-murdering home invader. I could feel myself tensing up, as I stood there naked and unprotected. Thinking I heard footsteps, I took a step back, and slipped on the small puddle of conditioner. I remember feeling my feet flying towards the air while my upper-body swung towards the floor. With a sharp pain to the side of the head, everything went black. By the time I came to, the water was running cold. I called my dad, and he brought me to the hospital. I was rewarded with 9 stitches to the temple.

 nbsp;

It's amazing what peer pressure can make you do, even when your peers don't actually exist. In a matter of weeks, my captive audience managed to completely disrupt my life. After the shower incident, it was as though they were no longer on my side. One morning, I was crossing the street when I heard them gasp. I stopped, thinking a car was heading my way. Fortunately, the street was empty. Unfortunately, my rapid stop caused me to slip on the ice and break my wrist. They laughed. Several days later, I had an important marketing presentation at work. The studio audience kept making disapproving noises, sometimes even booing me mid-presentation. It got me so tongue-tied that I messed up the whole sales pitch.

 nbsp;

The worst was what they did to my relationship with Eric. Whenever we fought, they conveyed to me through "Urrrgh!"s and "Pffftt!"s that Eric was a complete scumbag. I'm not even sure what our last fight was about. I think it started with asking him to close the laundry room door. It was such an insignificant little fight, but made worse by the advice and reactions of a bunch of imaginary strangers. They made me doubt my feelings for him, until I finally cut him loose, much to their delight.

 nbsp;

My relationships with my parents and friends devolved in a similar manner. It was shocking for me to hear what my subconscious mind actually thought about the people that had surrounded me all my life. After a few more incidents at work, my boss fired me. I was left without loved ones, friends, or a job. I felt so isolated, despite being accompanied at all times by the voices in my head. Alone in my living room, I drunk-dialed my ex, and he came over to cheer me up. We got back together that night, and it was wonderful.

 nbsp;

Everything went back to normal after Eric and I rekindled our flame. I still heard the constant and distracting laugh track, but I tried my hardest to ignore them. I was happy again, and slowly but surely, I mended every bond I'd broken. I even got my old job back. Apparently, my boss couldn't handle the workload without me. Or so I've been told. For a while, all was right with the world, until one dreadful night.

 nbsp;

I was half-asleep when I heard a knock at the door. I peeked through the window, only to find a squad car in the driveway. My heart stopped, and my faithful audience "OOoOOOOoO"ed. I opened the door, but of all the things those cops told me, all I remember hearing was this:

 nbsp;

"I'm sorry 'mam, there's been an accident."

 nbsp;

The studio audience roared with laugher and applause. Eric had died. My heart broke, but my spectators continued chuckling wildly. When Eric's casket was lowered into his grave, they laughed even harder. Tears streamed down the sides of my face, but they did not stop giggling and snickering the whole time.

 nbsp;

I must be some kind of sick monster, because I can't keep them from laughing whenever I think of him. I just can't get them to stop. 




 Man, ya gotta enunciate. When you say that last line, really put emphasis on the "ip" of "ipsum", like so:

Lorem **IP**sum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Otherwise, it's not going to work. 




 You need to draw a pentagram in blood, place a screenshot of the author's submission page in the centre, chant the forbidden words, and bright forth the author to give you his OK. 




 And now I want to write about a dude afraid of kittens. 




 I liked it!
Someone should try and stop her from driving. She could really hurt some people.

That right there. Haunting stuff. 




 I think the voice is good, but the sound quality is a little off. There's a lot of static.

OH DEAR GOD WHY IS THERE A SPIDER!?


Edit, now that I have recovered from the background image: Good pacing. Pacing is important. Your pacing is good. Spiders are not good. But the pacing is good. Yes. Good narration. 




 Oh, man. That sounds awesome...and horrific. I definitely want to read it when it's done. 




 Focus on the protagonists' reaction and thoughts about those fears. For instance, I've been working on a story where this dude has to grab something under a body bag. He has absolutely no reason to think something's going to happen to him, but he gets all nervous about it any ways. He ends up closing his eyes, and thinks he hears the bag crackling. He starts worrying that the corpse is alive, and that it's sitting up and looking at him, but he won't open his eyes to check. He later leaves the room, never knowing whether or not the corpse really moved. You can feel his terror without there being an actual, physical antagonist. 




 They're all yours! 




 The solution when you come across this kind of stuff is to tack "DUN DUN DUUUUUUN!" to the final sentence. Works every time.

Or does it? DUN DUN DUUUUUN! 




 Horror is like a box of chocolate: everything is delicious, except for the coffee-flavored truffles, because you wanted chocolate, damn it, not coffee.

There's no one good or bad recipe for horror, which is why I like the genre so much. As a writer, I get to dabble in different styles of horror without feeling like it's getting stagnant.

My advice to you is to start by writing about what scares *you* (unless you have a really weird phobia of, like, kittens or something). No matter what type of horror you write about, you'll find people who will enjoy it, so just go with what you're in the mood for. 




 Woah there, bucko. It's "Blood blood blood." Three bloods, and a period. That's a huuuuge distinction. The notebooks with "blood blood" are barely worth the paper they're written on. 




 Eh, it's a mix of virgin's blood and goat's blood, when I run out. And you ask why I have those? Why WOULDN'T I have them? 




 Do notebooks with the word "Blood blood blood." written about 500 times across its many pages count? Because I have, like, 20 of those in my the back of my car.

It would be kind of neat if we had a link in the sidebar to a page listing everyone's books (titles, urls, format). We could call it the NoSleep Library or NoSleep Bookshelf or something like that. Just a thought. 




 The selection committee ran out of tacos at the All-You-Can-Eat Taco Emporium and Crematorium. In their grief, they lost their joy de vivre and were unable to run the contest.* It's tragic, really.

*The following message may or may not be 100% accurate. 




 Thank you so much! If/when you write those posts, it will definitely help a lot of people out, myself included. 




 I'd really love to know how distribution rights work. Or, rather, what to look for and/or be weary of. I see you guys chiming about author rights when magazines call for submissions, and I have no idea what's reasonable and what isn't.

I'd also like to know your thoughts on self-publishing versus getting a publisherebooks versus physical copies, and how you'd go about it.

Another important thing I was wondering about, though this one probably doesn't have a concrete answer, is when do you know when you're ready to take that step? I absolutely love writing, and I have been extremely fortunate and lucky that some of my stories have appealed to people here, but I don't know if that means I can or should take it to the next level. Should unpublished writers just throw caution to the wind and go for it? Would it be best to try and submit for magazines and see if any of them bite so you have a -for lack of a better word- resum of published works?

Anything you share would be most helpful.

Thank you! 




  I actually plan on putting a few posts up here about my own experiences with self publishing because I just like helping out my homies.

That would be absolutely fantastic. Please do. I've been curious about the whole process.
 




 I've been *Itch*ing to try this out. Count me in! 




 I wish I could, but I am physically incapable of smiling with these twitches forcing my lips downwards at all times.

 In your BOOK? I see what you did there, you sneaky punster, you! 




 GASP!
I'll just have to douse myself in salt.


Edit: Wait, no. I'm not the one doing the ritual. What do I care about protecting myself against slug demons? 




 What if it's a slug demon? 




 Man, your parents will be ticked off when they wake up to go to the washroom and step on a bunch of salt. 




 If you were a carnival ride, which ride would you be and what would be your maximum capacity? 




 This is NoSleep. For all we know, the bobble heads will be decapitated.

 Okay, who let Tortilla back into the wine cellar? 




 How the thinks anyone will believe he wrote that while he apparently cannot write a complete sentence is beyond me. 




 Dozens of missing posters cling to lampposts on the empty streets outside my home. Most hold photos of beloved family pets, but a few show the faces of children. They rustle in the wind, providing the only sound I can hear for miles, safe for the relentless tapping of the creatures feet against the sides of my house. I have not seen a soul in days. The monster has doubtlessly gotten them all by now. Perhaps there are still a few people left alive, naively praying for help to arrive. Those who wisely chose to hide in their basements could yet have survived, but nothing will stop it from reaching them, too. What happened here was my fault: I awoke the prehistoric menace. All I can do now is sit and wait for the end.

 nbsp;
 
Ever since I was a boy, I have been fascinated with fossils. It began the day my parents took me to the lake for a fireworks display. While we were waiting for the show to begin, my mother told me that a man had recently stumbled across a large fossil on the shore. I am not sure whether she was trying to give a bored child something to do, or merely sharing a tidbit of information. Either way, I did what any kid would do in such a situation: I started hunting for a fossil of my own, dreaming of the fame and fortune it would bring me. I walked up and down the shoreline, eyes peeled for anything of interest, until I noticed a thin slab of black stone among the rocks. Something about it just screamed "fossil", and I excitedly turned it over. On its underside was a perfectly-preserved silvery ammonite, shimmering in the setting sunlight. The fossil was about an inch wide, and was accompanied by a few smaller specimens. I was positively beaming with pride when I showed it to my parents, boasting that I had made an incredible discovery, and that my long and fruitful career as an archaeologist had begun.

 nbsp;

Over 20 years later, that fossil was still on display in my living room, even though my career as a palaeontologist did not pan out. (One of my teachers informed me that archaeologists do not, in fact, dig up dinosaurs.) Still, that fortuitous discovery in my childhood stuck with me through my entire life, and I never quite lost the compulsion to look for fossils wherever I went. As the years passed, I found other specimens: smaller ones, broken ones, but never one as striking as my very first. Not until last summer, that is.

 nbsp;

It was a pleasant day: sunny and warm, but without the overwhelming humidity that usually weighed me down. Kids were playing in the streets, blue jays were battling squirrels for sunflower seeds in my feeder, and the sky was as clear as I had ever seen it. I decided to take advantage of the beautiful day by going for a stroll through the woods in my backyard. Following a beaten path, I navigated through the trees and to a quarry of stones beyond the woodland, where I sometimes searched for fossils. Up until then, I had not found any specimens there, but my luck was about to change. Extending from a mound of rocks, I spotted a polished burgundy stone. As I made my way towards it, I noticed a shape on its side. It was the most beautiful fossil my eyes had ever seen. About half a foot in diameter, the ammonite looked impeccable in every way. Its golden hue made it seem almost magical. I examined the snail-like relief, re-experiencing the genuine enthusiasm I had felt as a child.

 nbsp;

I ran back to my place, my heart pounding with joy, and retrieved a wheelbarrow and towels to carry and protect the stone. After loading the boulder onto my makeshift carrier, I began pushing the heavy stone back home, sweat pouring down the sides of my face. I cleared some of the bushes in the garden outside my front door, and placed the stone carefully among my plants. For weeks, I showed it off to everyone that stopped by: neighbors, family members, even the pizza delivery boy. I felt giddy just looking at my amazing lawn decoration.

 nbsp;

As obsessed with and proud of the fossil as I was, I am ashamed to admit it took me far too long to notice the change. At first, I thought it was just a trick of the light. It would seem a little bit bigger when I came home from work, but not so much so that it struck me as unusual. It was not until I returned from a two-week vacation that I truly realized the fossil was morphing. Though I counted five rings on its spiral when I left, I returned to find seven, and a sense of dread began to form in the back of my mind. Over the course of the following weeks, the creature became larger and larger. As more rings appeared and it grew from one foot to three, it became clear that the stone holding it could no longer contain the mass.

 nbsp;

One morning, I stepped outside to find the red boulder shattered in half, and the spiral-shaped creature absent from its surface. All that was left was the scent of seaweed and salt emanating from the broken stone. My immediate reaction was that of relief. That is, until I saw the creature in the very foundation of my house. Still golden, still static, but several feet larger, the fossil had found a new home. It was around that time that missing posters started popping up, and that my birdfeeder ceased emptying. I should have seen the signs, but I was in denial. Besides, how could a fossilized creature come to life? I dug my head in the sand, convincing myself that it was just the work of a very talented guerrilla artist. I was a fool for not taking action: I should have destroyed it when I had the chance.

 nbsp;

The metamorphosis accelerated after the creatures relocation. The snail-like shape grew larger, and began to uncoil, revealing thousands of tiny spiky legs protruding from its shell. The stench of an ocean breeze infected every corner of my house as the monstrous form grew to a meter in length. I was terrified beyond words, but powerless to stop the coming storm. No one believed me when I told them what was happening. Some laughed, others called me crazy. Every day, new missing posters got tacked to the areas mailboxes and lampposts, offering rewards that would never be claimed. Nothing could stop the monster from growing, until, one day, it ceased hiding within stone, leaving nothing but a crack in the concrete in its wake. I hoped it had moved on, but it was not long before I heard that Mrs. Carsons son had gone missing. He was the first of many children to mysteriously 'disappear'. I stopped leaving the house after that day.

 nbsp;

A few nights ago, I finally ran out of food. Too afraid to abandon the safety of my home, I called for pizza. I thought it would be all right. I would never have done it if I had known what was about to happen. I watched as the delivery boy exited his car and walked up to my door. A dark shape scurried in the bushes outside. I knew it was the monster, so I frantically banged on the window, trying to warn the man. As he reached for the doorbell, the horrid beast launched itself towards him. Not wanting to see, I shut my eyes, but could still hear the ghastly CRUNCH as it engulfed him, leaving nothing behind. Sobbing profusely, I glanced out the window, and could clearly make out the armor-plated form of the horrid millipede-like creature in the cars headlights. It had grown to over ten meters in length. I shut the curtains in fear when it snapped its head towards me, as though insulted that I dared to look at it. The piercing sound of shredding metal echoed down the street as the creature ate the delivery boys car.

 nbsp;

I can hear it skittering along the outside of my house now. It will not hurt me. Not yet, at least. It is saving me for later. This is its nest, and I am to be the food for the hundreds of young ones it spawned in the inner walls of my home. I have spent my whole life looking for fossils. Now that they surround me, I cannot help wishing I had taken up knitting instead. 




 Congratulations, ya'll! 




 Congratulations to the both of you! I look forward to catching up to date on the NoSleep podcast (I'm nearing the end of season 3) and hearing your stories. : ) 




 But I so enjoy touching things. ;D 




 Happy anniversary, Mr. Butler! I love you beyond the scope of words, and my love for you is as eternal as the darkness of the night. 




 Unless /u/voodoovegetable is *actually* a serial killer and is only asking to cover his tracks... 




 New idea: a compilation book of all our stories, presented in a step-by-step interpretive dance guide format. It'll make the NY Times best sellers list in no time flat. 




 In her permission form, it just said that the intention was *not* to make money, but that should that change in the future, it would be divided equally between the writers, but that if a writer had more than one story, they would still get the same percentage. 




 When I gave my consent, I had no idea this was being done against the wishes of the moderators. I am definitely withdrawing it now. 




 Or species. 




 That wasn't chicken. 




 Ooooo, that would be awesome. And then you add in a feature where they  also warm up the house (in the winter) so that you can leave your bed and *not* freeze while getting dressed. Would it drive up the heating bill? Yes. Would it be worth it? ABSOLUTELY. 




 My sister got me an alarm clock for Christmas that imitates the sunrise. Over the course of half an hour, it lights up brighter and brighter until the alarm goes off. It's very pleasant, I would definitely recommend it.

The most important thing; however, is to keep electronics OUT of the bedroom. Lights and electronics can keep you from sleeping well and that, in turn, will keep you from waking up well. 




 It's okay. I read my income tax reports in David's voice.

Just a thought, Mr. Cummings: you could open a second Podcast called 'David Cummings reads your taxes." You'll make millions. 




 ...xD 




 That is so wonderfully poetic. 




 Huh, consider me impressed and newly-informed. I figured sites could pull your MAC address just like they do the rest of the information they keep track of. 




 Any comment that is positive is a comment that I like! Unless the comment is positive in the sense of a pregnancy test. I don't want my stories getting pregnant. They're too young to have babies. 




 I was wondering where you were going with that. And then I got to the end. And now, I applaud you. 




 David Cummings and Peter Lewis are definitely my two favorite male narrators. Jessica Prokuski is my favore female narrator. I'd say my LEAST favorite narrator is Demon Overlord 5000. His voice is just too...I don't know...raspy?

 




 Geez, why are people giving you a hard time? o0; It's a legitimate topic of discussion.

I didn't watch a lot of horror movies growing up in order to protect my eardrums from my mom's high-pitch screams. Now that I'm older, I find that the problem with horror movies is that they rely too heavily on jump scares rather than actually trying to frighten you...so most movies do end up being Asylum-level bad. I remember watching The Cube and 13 Ghosts when I was in highschool. Both times, my friends were terrified and squeezing the blood out of my hands. Guess everyone's different.
*Edit: Taming the typo demons. 




 I've played games where they could ban a specific computer's MAC address. The unruly player usually just jumped on their laptop and kept being a jerk. 




 My dad startled posting stories to NoSleep a couple months ago. One time, when he was visiting me, he posted before I had the chance to post mine, and I was locked out of posting for another 10 minutes.

I know it's too keep people from spamming, but c'mon. We weren't even using the same computer. This could have been prevented if Reddit had put the stopper on the MAC addresses instead.

So my guess would be around 10 minutes. 




 I was in the middle of talking to Sarah when you said that. Weird. 




 I just updated it. 
























 And suddenly everything feels itchy. 




 Of course, Knotty! 




 I wish I knew. My gut tells me that the same planes that destroyed my home town might have dropped the dust. They moved fast...and over the black sky, they could easily be mistaken for shooting stars. The music was loud: I wouldn't be surprised if none of us heard them. 




 Maybe you're right...I mean, worst case scenario, I find out he was behind it. I kind of want to keep on pretending, but the thought that it was him still lingers in my head. Either what I read will clear his name, or confirm my worst fears. 




 I had a rough go for a while, especially during my college years. I was fortunate enough to have a really great school counsellor who recommended I go talk to a colleague of his. 




 Time to write a contest entry, I guess :P

I believe you meant to say: "Time to write a story THAT WILL CRUSH AND ANNIHILATE ALL OTHER ENTRIES IN ITS AWESOMENESS."

But I understood you either way. You get'em, Knotty!
 




 I got a similar message last month for the February contest, and looked her up. From what I recall, she's a leader at nanowrimo and a mod at that website. Everything looked legit to me. 




 I never thought of it that way...the pneumonia did start after I spent a weekend at his cabin.

It was annoying, but I was a kid. Things always bothered me less as a child. Cold water, for instance. I can't stand swimming in a cold lake nowadays, but when I was a kid, I'd jump right in without hesitating. 




 When I was a young girl, I lived in the town of Tadaldak, just outside Whitesand Provincial Park in Northern Ontario. It was a small community, not found on any map. On the night of the meteor shower in 1981, Tadaldak went from a lively town of around 2 000 residents, to ashes scattered across the woodlands. I was the only survivor.

 nbsp;

Tadaldak was a beautiful town filled with rustic-looking houses built with wood from the surrounding forest. Our homes had much more spirit to them than any of the mass-produced condos I've lived in since. I'm not preaching about colors of the wind or anything like that: I just appreciate genuine human craftsmanship. Due to Tadaldak's secluded location, there was no way in or out of town, except for an ice road that appeared only in the coldest months of winter. Because of this, it was impossible to get supplies, so we had to be self-sustaining. Most of us knew how to hunt and fish, so we were never in danger of starvation.

 nbsp;

Though our supply of fresh fruits and vegetables was limited, we found every excuse to indulge. That's how the Starlight Festival came to be. In mid August, the town got together to celebrate week-long meteor showers that took place every year.

 nbsp;

As summer drew to an end and preparations for the festival began, I came down with pneumonia and had to be hospitalized. All day long, I watched from the window as the area transformed. Paper streamers were hung along town square, benches were installed, and food stands were rolled into place. Every night, when I saw the first star in the sky, I made a wish that I would get better in time for the festivities.

 nbsp;

By the first day of the festival, I was feeling much better, but I was still stuck on oxygen. I nagged and begged the nurses to release me, giving them my most irresistible pair of puppy-dog eyes. Finally, the doctor agreed to let me out, under three conditions: I had to carry a portable oxygen tank, I had to be accompanied by a nurse, and I had to come straight back to the hospital once the meteor shower was over. I was thrilled beyond words.

 nbsp;

A few hours later, I was sitting in the crowd as lively music blared through old speakers set up around town square. Nurse Jesse was kind enough to sit with me while my parents watched from a few rows back. The scent of fried food and sweets  a rare treat in our neck of the woods  filled my nostrils, and I excitedly looked from food stand to food stand, wondering if there was enough room in my stomach to try everything. One by one, the lights in the town turned off, as the sun descended onto the horizon. The sky was clear, welcoming the dim remnants of lights from far-away galaxies.

 nbsp;

"Ooooooooo!", uttered the crowd, as the celestial show began.

 nbsp;

Lights streamed above us as hundreds of shooting stars made their way across the heavens. I sat in awe, grateful that I was there to see the show. Then, something unusual happened: shimmering speckles began falling from the sky. My immediate thought was that forest fairies were blessing our festival by spreading pixiedust into the crowd. The scene looked enchanted, and I lifted my hands to try and catch the magical substance, thinking it would imbue me with the ability to fly. The powder was thick and weightless, like soot from a campfire. It dissolved as I manipulated it between my fingers. The stardust fell faster, covering us like a winter storm. I could hear people around me coughing, sneezing, and wheezing. A sudden twinge of guilt came over me, as it occurred to me that I might have infected everyone with pneumonia.

 nbsp;

Wind blew the speckles of stardust away, but the crowd became even more agitated than before. I could see fear in their eyes, which, in turn, frightened me. Never had I seen so many adults look so disturbed, yet I had no idea why they were scared. I turned to nurse Jesse for comfort, hoping he knew what was going on, but what I saw sent me into full blown panic: the whites of his eyes had turned red, and blood leaked from every orifice on his head. I started sobbing and let out a muffled scream, fog forming in my mask. Nurse Jesse hacked loudly, clawing at his throat until his nails drew blood. Moments later, he fell over lifelessly. I screamed for help, but my weakened voice could not break through the agonized sounds around me. I turned to my parents, but they were already on the floor, bleeding. I saw hundreds of friends, family, and neighbors succumb to the same fate. Silence replaced the chaos. I wished I could hear their screams again, because the silence scared me more. The silence meant it was over.

 nbsp;

Tears clouding my vision, I tried to get up so I could find help. My oxygen tank had gotten wedged between Nurse Jesse and the bench, locking me in place. Snot leaked into my mouth, but I couldn't wipe it away because the mask was in the way. Having been given strict orders not to remove it, I dealt with the uncomfortable salty taste. I tugged at my tether, finally yanking myself free. When I saw Nurse Jesse's blood smeared along the silver canister, I started howling like a voice-neutered banshee.

 nbsp;

Thanks to my parents, I knew to seek help in an emergency. I rotated the oxygen tank onto its wheels, and started walking towards the only logical place: the hospital. If anyone could help, it was the doctors and nurses. My lungs were on fire as I inched my way across town. I had to deviate from my path many times to avoid stepping on the sick townsfolk. I was too young to tell whether they were dead or alive. I was going to be the hero who saved Tadaldak.

 nbsp;

I felt drained by the time I reached the hospital, but a wave of relief gave me a second wind, and I ran inside. It was far too quiet in the hospital. My insides twisted as I walked around the corner and saw the bodies on the ground, faces painted in streams of blood. I ran over and shook Nurse James, begging her to wake up, but her cold body remained unresponsive.

 nbsp;

Once reality set in, I started bawling loudly, and curled up in the corner. I kept telling myself I had to be a big girl: I had to make everyone better again. I was going to be the hero who saved Tadaldak. I repeated those words over and over in my head until they gave me enough strength to stand up. If the doctors and nurses couldn't help, then I had to go farther. My grandpa lived alone in the woods. He'd know what to do. I knew the way there, but it was going to be hard to reach him while carrying the oxygen tank.

 nbsp;

I had barely made it to the outskirts of town when I heard a distant rumbling. My flight-or-fight instinct suddenly kicked in, and I ripped the oxygen mask off my face so I could bolt into the woods as fast as my little feet could take me. As I hid under a maple tree, I saw a black, low-flying plane rip through the treetops and towards my home. It was followed by two more.

 nbsp;

I watched as hellfire rained down on my peaceful hometown. A strong wave of heat rippled through the air, and pushed me to the ground. I could smell Tadaldak burning from the short distance separating us. Ambers flew in every direction, twirling and dancing in the breeze. Pockets of warm air swelled through the foliage, making the landscape rattle like the chains of death. A mix of emotions overwhelmed me: desperation, worry, sorrow, confusion, and anxiety. I couldn't function, and didn't know what to do, except to stay right where I was as a raging fire took away all that I had ever known. I wasn't going to be a hero. I wasn't going to save Tadaldak. It was already too late.

 nbsp;

The planes came back for a second assault, though I doubt there was anything left to shoot. Before long, they streaked away in the horizon, like shooting stars.

 nbsp;

I'm not sure how long I hid in the bushes, sobbing to myself, but I remember what snapped me back to reality. From a short distance, I saw a bipedal, cloaked form with two bulging glassy eyes. I had heard legends of wraiths hiding in the woods, and thought that was precisely what I was looking at. I burrowed into a bush, hiding from and spying on the creature. Then, I heard it speak to another of its kind. I'll never forget what they said, nor the horrifyingly ordinary sound of their voices.

 nbsp;

"Get them all?", asked the first.

 nbsp;

"Yeh. Threw em in the fire with the others.", replied the second.

 nbsp;

They sounded human. I held back a whimper and made myself as small as possible, hoping beyond hope that they wouldn't hear my labored breathing. I knew they were going to hurt me if they found me.

 nbsp;

I honestly can't remember how I did it, but I eventually made it to my grandfather's place. I told him everything that happened while he peacefully consoled me. After that night, he took me in and raised me. Eventually, I grew up and moved out of the region. I visited him once in a while, but I couldn't stand being so close to the scar in the landscape, so my visits were few and far between.

 nbsp;

My grandfather died not too long ago. As his next of kin, I was tasked with handling his affairs. I took a trip to his cabin to clear out his things. In his attic, I found a locked wooden crate with ornate detailing. I wanted to take it with me, and searched all over the house for its key, without success. Eventually, I took the box to a locksmith, who was kind enough to unlock it for me. In the crate, I saw the big glassy eyes of a gas mask starring back at me. It sat on a bed of news clippings and file folders marked "Operation Ta'xet". I was too afraid to read what they said. I'd rather live the rest of my life pretending my grandfather wasn't involved with the obliteration of my hometown. 




 I laughed so hard my cat fell out of my lap. 




 You performed your monthly ritual, right? It should be OK. 




  Mods aren't omniscient beings that know every instance of rule breaking that occurs across the thousands of stories posted.

Waitthey're NOT?!
 




 Yeh. I wish we'd gone to the Museum of Nature instead. At least then, I'd have been able to look at the frogs...and draw the frogs really badly. 




 I really wanted to live there, but I couldn't take the plunge. Maintaining this place was too much of a drain. 




 Ugh! Don't you just hate it when that happens? 




 xD; Well, that's embarrassing. 




 For you, I'll throw them in for free. 




 I wish. 




 Is 150 000$ too steep? 




 Construction on my brand new condo finished this summer. Not wasting a second, I broke lease on my musky apartment, and moved in as soon as possible. I rather enjoyed knowing I was the first resident living here: there was no wear and tear, no smoke stains on the walls, and no damage to the structure. The only issue was a light clattering sound whenever I used the commercial sink in my laundry room. I rarely used it, so I didn't bring up the problem to the contractors. Everything else worked perfectly, and my home was as sterile as an operating table.

 nbsp;

After a few months, I began noticing water pooling at the foot of my shower. The drain must have been clogged. I took to my tools, unscrewed the shower drain, and peered inside. I could see a collection of fibers bunched up in the pipes. Reaching in with an unfolded coat hanger, I pulled out mountains of dirty blond hair clogging the pipes. I live alone, I don't have any pets, I haven't entertained a lady in over a year, and I've been bald since I was 27.

 nbsp;

The odd phenomena got me thinking about the sink in the laundry room. I detached the aerator, placed my hand under the faucet, and turned on the water. Dozens of molars came flying out, slipping through my fingers and into the sink, bouncing up and down until ultimately falling down the drain.

 nbsp;

On a completely unrelated note: I have a beautiful, fully furnished, barely-used condo for sale. Located in downtown Detroit. Anyone interested? 




 While we're on the topic, seems like [This guy]( https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Asylum/1588112608089682) right here is doing something similar. The weird thing is, he does mention in a few posts that he read said story on Reddit (though does not link back to the original), yet in about 90% of the cases, they're flat-out stolen.

Seems this one 




 I would love to! 




 Oh we can be much *much* tighter, if you'd like





Let me get the ropes.

*Wuahahahahah!* 




 The stepfather likes to keep his handcuffs where they belong: the bedroom. 




 Ooh, I got it backwards. Hmm...I swear, some people are shameless. 




 Yeah, those flags would be great. 




 I find that most Youtube narrators do not ask for permission, but do link back to the original story. Are you saying that Mr.CreepyPasta covered some of yours but linked back to the thief's website? If so, you can probably message him and have him give you credit instead. 




 If it helps, I'm perfectly fine with maintaining a viewable table of authors and their preferred licensing models.

That's a pretty good idea. It could probably be added to the table on the author's non-nosleep pages. I do get the feeling that most people won't bother looking before they take the material, though. Still, for the ones who typically take the time to ask for permission, it'd be a nice resource. 




 Brilliant. This is one of those stories that will definitely stick with me. 




 She was bitten by one just a few months ago, so he's not going to turn unless she decides to give him a nibble. 




 That's actually a brilliant idea. They'll know they blew their cover. Maybe it'll be enough to get them off my case. 




 Fair point, though in my head, the kid's not an emo. I suppose it should have been: "My mom thinks I'm emo because I have these cuts."

Y'know, parents are always throwing the wrong labels out there. Wear a leather bracelet, and they think you're a punk. Sacrifice a goat or two, and suddenly you're a Satanist. Silly parents. 




 That's hilarious! 




 Thank you! :) 




 Thanks. It was seriously supposed to be the stepfather. He's a teenager: he doesn't have a father-in-law. Fixed the post. 




 ARGH, thanks for catching that. It's supposed to be his stepfather. Must have had a brainfart. 




 Mom freaked out when she saw the cuts on my arms last month. She thought I was hurting myself. My stepfather was too much of a prick to tell her the truth. He stood in the corner, arms crossed, watching as she gripped me by the shoulders and tried to literally shake some sense into me. Even as she bawled her eyes out, holding me close to her and begging me not to hurt myself any more, the man kept his stupid ass mouth shut. He shot me this threatening look so I'd do the same.

 nbsp;

Mom set up an emergency counseling session. After a few weeks, when she saw that no new cuts had appeared, she wholeheartedly thanked the therapist for saving my life. Meanwhile, her husband did what he always does: he played dumb.

 nbsp;

She'll be so disappointed in me tomorrow morning, when she finds her claw marks all over me again. It'd be so much easier if we tied her up on the full moon. 




 Well...shit. Now I really regret signing those papers. 




 On a recent school trip, I visited the Central Experimental Farm, run by the Research branch of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. To me, the term "experimental farm" has always sounded ominous as hell. I pictured mutated livestock, chimeras, man-eating grain machines, and all sorts of creepy shit. Even though I was told experimental farms were just places where researchers tested out new techniques and equipment, I wasn't entirely convinced. Turns out, I was right to be suspicious.

 nbsp;

Before the start of the winter semester, I was informed that I needed to take a complementary course. There were three options: mid-century philosophy, sports psychology, and drawing class. Thinking I'd get to see a ton of hot nudes, I went for drawing class. Once the semester started; however, I quickly realized that the only melons I was going to see were in a fruit bowl. Week after week, I wasted away three hours of my life drawing inanimate objects while listening to a monotone snob drone on about contrast and texture or some shit like that. It was horrendously boring.

 nbsp;

One day, our professor announced he was planning a field trip to the Central Experimental Farm across town so we could draw live plants. He made arrangements with the various professors of classes taking place after his own, so students would spend a whole three hours at the location. I, on the other hand, had a spare after drawing class, so I wasn't exactly thrilled that I was going to lose a large chunk of homework time on traveling to and from the facility. Attendance was mandatory, so I had no choice but to follow along.

 nbsp;

Hitching a ride with a fellow student, I arrived at the experimental farm bright and early. From the outside, the place didn't look quite as disturbing as I had imagined. Three large greenhouses were situated at a central location between four snow-covered fields. Nested against the farthest greenhouse was a tall brown office building. Researchers probably did their work in there. In the summer, crops were grown using different methods in each of the fields, and then tested to see which worked best. As far as I could tell, there wasn't any livestock. I couldn't even see a traditional farmhouse on the property. I began thinking I'd sorely overestimated the creep factor of the place: everything looked normal.

 nbsp;

Once the teacher showed up, an employee escorted us into one of the greenhouses. I was amazed by the change of atmosphere when I stepped through a set of plastic strips separating the entranceway from the inside. Where the world had been cold and dry moments before, it was now warm, humid, and brimming with life. A variety of plants filled the semi-circular shelter, creating its own unique ecosystem. There were tall palm trees hanging over bushes, flowerbeds floating atop a pond, and even cucumbers growing upside-down on a fenced mesh. We were given freedom to explore the greenhouse and draw what ever tickled our fancy. I roamed about until I found a plant that looked kind of badass across a stream full of koi. I had brought a digital camera to take reference pictures in case I didn't have time to finish my drawing, so I quickly snapped a shot of the plant, before I began drawing it.

 nbsp;

I'm no Picasso, so it didn't surprise me when my drawing went from a somewhat accurate outline, to a piece of shit. Thinking the plant I'd chosen was too advanced' for me, I abandoned my spot, and went about looking for an easier alternative. It was during this search that I came across a narrow passageway connecting the main greenhouse to the next. A set of plastic strips hung from a doorframe to the second greenhouse. I could clearly see the words "Employees only" marked in red above the door. Glancing around to make sure no one was watching, I ignored the sign and went inside. Why would I bother respecting their little warning, if they weren't even going to bother locking that shit up?

 nbsp;

The air was much thicker inside the second greenhouse, and I could see a drastic change in the types of plants within it. This greenhouse had a tropical rainforest feel to it. The foliage was lush and the plant life was foreign to me. I walked around the area cautiously, keeping my ears open for the sound of footsteps. I took photos of everything I saw. One plant in particular, at the very back of the greenhouse, piqued my interest. It was unlike anything I had ever seen in my life: its stem was purple and branched out into light blue, it was covered in tiny razor-sharp thorns that were barely visible to the naked eye, and it had clusters of plump red strawberries dangling from its leafy ends. I took several pictures of the unique plant. The fruit growing from it looked and smelled amazing, like a basket of fresh berries in the middle of summer. I couldn't resist.

 nbsp;

As I reached for one of the strawberries, I nicked my forearm on one of its thorns. My arm went completely numb almost instantaneously, like when you fall asleep on it and wake up to find it limp as a wet noodle. Heck, I couldn't even feel the bones holding it in place. It was as though the entire limb had turned into jello. The numbing sensation spread to the rest of my body. Before I even knew what was happening, I was laying on the floor with the plant towering over me. I was scared, and tried to call for help, but my tongue felt swollen and my words came out as incoherent babbling, like after a visit to the dentist. My vision began to blur and darken around the edges. I'm not sure if it was an optical illusion, but I could have sworn I saw a purple vine slithering towards me as I lay there paralyzed. I was certain I was going to die and, though I was terrified, I was thankful it was painless. The world around me disappeared, and I found myself feeling as though I was floating in the abyss.

 nbsp;

A splash of cold water hit my face, bringing me back to the land of the living. I opened my eyes, only to see a bright shining light directly in front of me. I groaned and turned my head. As far as I could tell, I was no longer in the greenhouse. It was dark and cold. Every inch of my body prickled as my sense of touch came back little by little. I heard something, like the distant and muffled sound of someone shouting. Another splash of water, and I awoke fully. I gasped for air, screaming in pain. My body ached in places I didn't even know existed. It didn't help that I was sitting on an uncomfortable wooden chair, but I think I'd have been in as much agony on a futon anyways.

 nbsp;

As I sat there, confused, scared, and in a great amount of physical distress, I began trying to make out my surroundings. I was definitely in a room: the walls were close to me. If I'd had enough strength to stretch my arm out, I probably would have been able to touch them. I could barely make out the outline of two men standing behind the spotlight in front of me. One by one, they started barking questions at me, like I was some kind of criminal on one of those cop shows. I could barely understand what they were saying, let alone formulate the syllables needed to answer them. They grilled me for hours, and as time passed, I was finally able to respond. I tried telling them I was a student on a field trip and got turned around, but they wouldn't listen to me. They just went on and on, until I broke down and started crying. My eyes were burning, but the tears eased some of the pain. I felt absolutely helpless. I wanted to go home.

 nbsp;

I think those sick fucks were waiting for me to break down, because they dimmed the spotlight not long after, and pushed a piece of paper over to me. Up until that moment, I hadn't even realized there was a table in front of me. Good thing I didn't try kicking them in the nuts like I wanted to. Not that I would have been able to if I tried: I was so sore, it felt like I'd been body checked by three hockey players at once. I couldn't think clearly, not with the men impatiently screaming at me, waving their hands at the piece of paper. I signed. I don't even know what the paper said, but I signed the fucking thing. The men toned down their aggression afterwards.

 nbsp;

Finally, I was pulled to my feet by one of the men. He was big, buff, and looked like some kind of security guard or something. He took me to a car waiting outside. By then, it was night, and I wondered how they'd justified my absence to my professor. Hadn't anyone wondered where I'd been? I was too emotionally and physically drained to say anything during the ride home. Frankly, I'm not even sure I gave the driver my address. He just kind of knew where to go. He stopped in front of my house, opened the back door, glared at me, and threatened that I'd be in big trouble if I told anyone what had happened. Fuck that shit. You're reading this now, so clearly I didn't listen to him.

 nbsp;

Later that night, as I was resting in bed, I remembered my camera. By then, my body was still a little sore, but felt much better. My left arm still felt odd, though. I could barely move it, and the skin on it was numb. Using only my good arm, I looked through my things, and found the digital camera in my backpack. I flicked the switch, trying to find a photo of the plant. I wanted to look it up online. The SD card was empty. They deleted EVERYTHING, even the photos I took a month ago and never got around to transferring. They were all gone.

 nbsp;

It's been a few days, and my arm's still not working quite right. It moves slowly, and my muscles are sore like when you start lifting weights after a long break. I'm pretty sure those dudes are watching me, because there's this car outside my house at all times. When I leave home, it follows me from a distance. I managed to give them the slip today. I snuck out the back door and went straight to the library. I'm posting this via a public computer so they can't trace that shit back to me. I don't know what they want or what they'll do if they found out I talked. Either way, I needed to tell someone. There's some real weird shit going on at the experimental farm. What ever they're doing there, it's not normal. 




 Oh my, how fortuitous! 




 Hmm? 




 Like the others pointed out, there's /r/nosleepteams, where a single story is co-written by a team of writers. But there are also series where different parts have been posted by separate writers, like the famous [All In Good Time](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoSleepOOC/comments/2keyy5/list_of_stories_involving_all_in_good_time_or/) series. Every section is kind of stand-alone, yet goes together. 




 Funny thing is, it actually wasn't. I tried signing in using 'password' as a password, but nada. Fortunately, the lovely admins reset everything and I was ultimately able to sign up again with a real password this time. 




 RIP jogger, RIP. 




 To me, the most disturbing part of this is thinking about you taking care of Brambles' litterbox. 




 Yeah, definitely not my brightest moment. I figured out that "email" had to be changed to one's email address. It just didn't occur to me that "password" was a variable, too. I kicked myself for that one. Hahaha. 




 Protip: Don't be like me and moronically assume it's a command to receive an email to set up a password. You have to input the password you want in there. 




 FIDDLESTICKS AND FUDGESICLES. Nope. NOPE. NOPE. 




 In my case, I never received an email. It just kind of worked. 




 I'd feel a lot better if he was, but I don't think so. 




 When I was in high school, my friends and I had a peculiar pastime. Like any teenage delinquent, we liked to cause trouble. We weren't vandals, we didn't deal drugs, and we certainly didn't bully kids in school. No, we liked to scare the living shit out of new parents by "hacking" their baby monitors. We were insufferable little punks who thought we were too good to get caught, and that our little acts of mischief would go unpunished. One night; however, I learned my lesson, and realized that I wasn't quite as bulletproof as my tremendous adolescent ego made me out to be.

 nbsp;

Dimitri, Kurt, and I went to the same school, shared many of the same classes, and hung out almost every evening after chow time. We watched prank shows, played video games, talked about who had the nicest rack in school. One evening, we were trading scary stories at the park. Kurt shared the classic story about the single mother who heard a haunting voice on her baby monitor. Like most horror stories, it sounded like total bullshit, but Dimitri told us it had happened to his mom once. On her own monitor, she'd heard a neighbour singing to her baby. Apparently, it was possible to accidentally tap into someone else's frequency. In an instant, a lightbulb turned on in each of our heads. When you're close enough to someone, you don't need words to know what that person is thinking, and we could all tell we were thinking the exact same thing: we were going to buy a baby monitor and screw with people.

 nbsp;

Pardon the pun, but hacking a baby monitor is child's play. All you need to do is find a device on the same frequency as yours. Never one to do things half-assed, I purchased a high-end monitor with a frequency dial so we could prank as many targets as possible. The following night, we took to our bikes, roamed the neighbourhood, and found our first victim. We could see the nursery from the suburban home's second floor window. Dimitri grabbed the baby monitor and began tuning it to different frequencies, until we heard breathing. I remember feeling excited as our plan finally came to fruition. Dimitri pressed the button, and began exhaling heavily into the receiver.

 nbsp;

"yourlittle girlwasdelicious", he murmured, using a demonic voice.

 nbsp;

The light in the master bedroom turned on almost immediately, and we heard a shrill scream. Laughing our asses off, we quickly rode off down the street so we wouldn't get caught.

 nbsp;

We repeated the prank several times over the course of the following weeks, each taking turns talking through the monitor. Not wanting anyone to get wise to our little game, we chose different houses every time. People's reactions were priceless: some mothers would reply in a panic, others seemed to know it was a hoax and told us to shut up, and one poor woman even started sobbing uncontrollably, begging us not to hurt her baby. I feel bad about that last one now that I'm older, but it was hilarious to me back then. My friends and I mimicked her high-pitch bawling and desperate cries for mercy for weeks afterwards. Yeah, we were royal dicks.

 nbsp;

Karma's a bitch, and I got what was coming to me one night. Kurt and Dimitri were busy studying for their midterms, so I went out on my own. By then, we'd gotten pretty much everyone in the surrounding area, so I decided to venture off across town and into unfamiliar territory. Finding a target wasn't difficult: you just had to look for cars with baby seats, houses with overly-colorful cartoon-themed curtains, or toys left in the yard. I came across a house that fit all three criteria, and parked my bike out of view. Playing with the tuner, I eventually found the right frequency. I could hear the sound of a baby snoring very lightly. A devious little smirk pushed its way onto my lips, and my heart began pounding with excitement. It was my time to shine.

 nbsp;

"Iamwatching", I whispered into the monitor, using the creepiest voice I could muster.

 nbsp;

The house remained dark and lifeless. I figured the home owners hadn't heard me.

 nbsp;

"Istandover your bedwatchingwaitingI will get you", I said, louder this time.

 nbsp;

Nothing. Just the sounds of crickets chirping, and the occasional dull roar of a car driving down the street. It was a little odd. Parents usually reacted much quicker than that. I began feeling a little nervous, and somewhat exposed. You know, like when you suddenly realize some creeper's gawking at you? It was getting late, and I had a long bike ride home. Just as I was about to give up and leave, I heard a strange, moist gurgling sound coming from the monitor. The quiet, rhythmic snores ceased, and I assumed the baby had woken up and was about to start crying. Instead, a man spoke to me.

 nbsp;

"You're the onebeingwatched nowJuan.", he said softly.

 nbsp;

My stomach pirouetted at his words. How did he know my name?! I felt sick. Something was very wrong, and I could feel it in my bones. I glanced up at the nursery window, and saw a silhouette standing there watching me. Had he been there the whole time? The air was thick and difficult to inhale, though perhaps fear was making it hard to breathe. My body quivered uncontrollably, as a sense of dread poured into every inch of me. I climbed on my bike, pedalling desperately to get away. Part of me thought I was overreacting, but the overwhelming need to flee overpowered my rational mind.

 nbsp;

"Youcan't runI knowwhere you live, Juan", continued the man, even as I turned the corner.

 nbsp;

I flew down the street, not stopping until I reached a busy boulevard. Surrounded by cars and a few late night joggers, I felt safe.

 nbsp;

"Your hoodie will run red your blood, boy", whispered the man, still talking through the baby monitor in my pocket.

 nbsp;

A passerby gave me a nasty look as I yelped loudly in fear, practically ripping my hoodie in my frantic attempt at removing it. To the stranger, I must have looked like some snotty kid tripping balls or something. He didn't know I was in genuine distress, so I don't blame him for walking off with an insulted huff, though I wish he had offered to help me instead.

 nbsp;

After stuffing the hoodie into my backpack, I noticed my name scrawled on the back. It was my fucking school jacket: no wonder that bastard knew my name. It then occurred to me that baby monitors were fairly short-ranged, so I was obviously being followed. I nervously glanced around to try and identify my stalker. Was it the empty-looking van down the street? That guy walking his dog? The car that had just driven by? Either way, the last thing I wanted was to hear that voice again, so I turned off the device, and started pedalling towards my home. Fear had heightened my senses, and I began notice every motion of the trees in the breeze, every crackle of twigs under my wheels, and every car that zipped past me. I flinched whenever anyone came near, paranoid that whoever had spoken to me through the baby monitor was going to catch up. Fortunately, I made it home without incident.

 nbsp;

I parked the bike in my garage and crawled up the stairs to my bedroom. In one careless motion, I tossed my backpack and the baby monitor in the corner of my room, and dove under my sheets like an Olympic swimmer. It doesn't matter how old you are: nothing feels safer than being under your blanket. I closed my eyes, hoping I'd be able to calm down enough to catch a few hours of rest before class, but then I heard static coming from the monitor across the room. The monitor that was supposed to be off.

 nbsp;

"Sweet dreams, Juan.", said the voice that still haunts my nightmares.

 nbsp;

Needless to say, I didn't sleep a wink that night. I was too frightened to get out of bed until sunrise. When I got up, my first order of business was to remove the battery from the monitor and throw it in the trash. I didn't want anything to do with it any more. I came up with an excuse to give my buddies so they wouldn't think I was a huge pussy. With massive bags under my eyes, I got dressed, had breakfast, and went to school.

 nbsp;

It wasn't until a few days later that I saw the house on the news. In an interview, a police officer explained that the small family who had been living in the house had been found in their beds, necks slit open. I had been outside when it happened: the killer had heard me on the baby monitor and decided to fuck with me. It was definitely a wake-up call, and I thanked my lucky stars that I hadn't gotten the shit murdered out of me. I was too busy feeling thankful that I survived to feel bad about the family that hadn't. Empathy, like wisdom, comes with age.

 nbsp;

Now that I'm an adult with a wife and daughter, I truly understand the consequences of my actions, and the severity of the situation I put myself in as a tremendously stupid teenage boy. That dreadful night, I thought I reached the epitome of fear, but it was just the tip of the iceberg. As a father, I now know that fear thrives and multiplies when there's something more precious than your own life at stake. I can't say for sure whether the killer found me again after all these years, or whether a new breed of idiots had the same idea as my friends and I, but I can tell you that I now understand what true terror is. Last night, I heard something on our baby monitor that sent chills into my very soul, shackling me with a paralyzing fear that I doubt will ever leave me:

 nbsp;

"I'mstillwatching" 




 Personally, I would never put my phone number online, for a variety of reasons. Can you imagine if you start getting charged for international text messages/calls?

That said, services like MagicJack and Skype let you buy phone numbers and receive calls through the magic of the internet rather than a phone line for a minimal fee. You could decide to set up a phone number for a couple of months and eventually drop it once the story loses its steam. That way, you don't get stuck with a huge phone bill and you maintain your privacy.

An alternative would be to use a fake email address. Easy to open, easy to close. 




 They want to steal my soul. 




 I'm sure it is. :P

Happy cake day. 




 Look at that adorable little guy! He thinks his arm is a gun!

 Did you mean
[A story to scare my son](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2igaa9/a_story_to_scare_my_son/)?

It was amazing, but definitely not underrated, as it won the monthly contest. 




 Craig's a trustworthy fellow connected to a real website. He contacted me back in December for the same reason. Not sure why your emails aren't getting through: I had no trouble communicating with him back then. If/when you manage to get through, he'll send you a consent form to fill out.

I know they have a huge backlog of stories to adapt, so once that step is done, it might take a while before you see anything on their website. Either way, I assure you they're perfectly legitimate.

Just like /u/notsohornyowl said, they sometimes team up with The NoSleep podcast. 




 I'm chuckling, but only because you tell the story in such an entertaining way. Nothing wrong with self-preservation.

In my own experience, when I was a teen, I once legitimately thought someone had broken into my home. My reaction was to grab one of my decorative (but sharp) swords and search the house. AKA the dumbest freaking thing you can do in that kind of situation. Though I saw the man, heard his footsteps, heard him talking...the house was empty. It was one of many times some weird stuff happened in that house. I'd say calling the cops is the smartest move, Knotty. Better safe than super-murdered. 




 I was on TrueKnot-duty tonight. 




 Don't! It's perfect, like a beautiful drunken haiku. 




 HECK YEAH! 




 These things come in waves. In December-January, it was people doing rituals, now it's this. Before you know it, we'll be on to something else. (I'm hoping for a killer unicorn dog trend.) 




 No worries: a lot of people don't know about the NoSleep Finder. I'd help you out if I knew the story title, but I've never heard of it, sorry.

 In all seriousness, though. The [NoSleep Finder](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleepfinder) is the perfect place to ask this question. Someone will find that story for you.

 A dull current surged through the woman's watch and into my body. It wasn't strong enough to cause pain, unlike the shock I'd gotten when I touched that tree in the forest, so I kept hold while I waited for her to respond. My eyebrows furrowed together, helping me produce a menacing and hopefully intimidating glare. Theo was always better at shakedowns than I was. My grip tightened, as though I believed the pressure would be enough to force a response out of the woman.



"I'm just checking in to make sure you're enjoying your stay.", she replied in a friendly tone, though her eyes betrayed contempt.



My hand started to burn, as the strength of the current intensified violently and unexpectedly. It reminded me of the time I mistook Theo's hotplate for my alarm clock the ONE TIME he'd forgotten to turn it off. My hands snapped back to my sides, and I looked down at my palm. The flesh seemed fine: not a burn in sight. By the time I looked back up, the woman was gone, and I was outside again with Theo. The sound of music flooded my ears once more, and all the physical and emotional pain seemed to go away, until Theo kicked me in the shin.



"Dude, get it together!", he barked, snapping me back to reality.



"GOD DAMN IT, THEO!", I screamed, waving my arms around frantically. "This time, we fucking stick together, okay!?", I howled.


I didn't want to lose track of my friend again, so I looped an arm firmly around his. It didn't matter what it looked like: this was about survival, not keeping up appearances. No matter what happened, I wasnt going to let Theo out of my sight. Then, I noticed something on his wrist.


"...Theo...where did you get that watch...?", I asked. 




 I'm 27 and I have a 3DS, as does my 40-something co-worker. No shame in loving Nintendo.

Either you have a fun-loving entity in your house, or your mom secretly loves to play your game and was disappointed you took it with you. I would leave it home tomorrow and doodle a smiley face on the post-it. 




 New Brunswick. I'll look it up once I get home, thanks for the tip! 




 Though my heart belongs to the butler, what remains (of my love) is yours. 




 Same storm, different location. 




 Would you say they've GRINDed to a hault? 




 Yesterday, as I was vacationing in the maritimes, a massive blizzard hit the region. I saw something out in the storm, and it freaked me the fuck out. Even though it's now bright and sunny outside, I'm almost glad my flight home got cancelled, because at least now I can stay inside where it's safe. I'm afraid of what might be hiding out there in the snowdrifts.

I woke up fairly late last morning. The basement apartment I rented for the week was practically pitch black, so I was startled to see it was already 10 am when I got around to checking the time. No light was coming through the blinds in the windows, making it seem as though it was still night. When I flipped open the blinds, I saw a wall of snow fully concealing me from the outside world. Grabbing my coat, I climbed the squeaky and narrow staircase leading to the side door. I could hear wind furiously hissing through a crease in the wall. I had heard about the region's infamous storms, but nothing could have prepared me for what happened when I opened that door. I was assaulted by a violent breath of snowy air. It nearly knocked me back, but I managed to grab hold of the hand ramp. Snow continued to invade the corridor and dart painfully into my eyes, making it almost impossible to see the tall snow bank that had once been a rental car. It took all my strength to get the door shut.

 nbsp;

As I returned to the quiet safety of the basement, I told myself there was no fucking way I was going outside again until the storm subsided. I grabbed my laptop, and checked out what people had to say on Twitter about the snowpocalpse. One helpful user posted a link to the city's traffic cameras, along with a single word: Creepy. Reassured that I wasn't the only out-of-towner disturbed by the sheer amount of snow, I followed the link to see how bad Main Street looked. The screen was practically all white, though I could make out a few buildings when the snow died down a bit. Though I'd been around snow all my life, I had never witnessed a blizzard first-hand, and I felt a little excited to be part of it. It was then that I noticed something odd in the street: there seemed to be a man standing in the flurry of snow. Thinking nothing of it, I switched to the other traffic cameras, checked out the rest of town, eventually grew bored, and shut the laptop so I could get breakfast.

 nbsp;

A few hours passed, but I could still hear mother nature having a temper tantrum outside. Bored, I looked at the traffic cameras again. I couldn't believe my eyes when I switched to Main Street. That fucking guy was STILL there! Sure, some people enjoy the cold, but this was ridiculous: he'd been standing there for hours. I switched to Main Street's secondary camera, which gave me a view from the other side of the street, hoping to see a squad car nearby. Maybe the guy was a traffic cop? Nothing. Not a damn thing. The snow-coated street was empty, except for a single human standing front-and-center. He gave me the creeps. Had he really been standing there the WHOLE time? I felt a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach, as though I knew some weird shit was going down, even though there could have been a perfectly logical explanation I was overlooking. Suddenly, the power went out, and I screamed like a kid. Using the laptop's screen to light the way, I searched the apartment for a flashlight. Fortunately, the power came back on after about half an hour.

 nbsp;

By the time internet service was restored, another hour had gone by. I had only one thing in mind: finding out whether or not that scary motherfucker was still outside. I went straight for the traffic cam. Wouldn't you know it, he hadn't fucking moved. I could see him swaying back-and-forth calmly, as though completely unaffected by the chaos around him. Looking at him made me feel nervous, yet I could not avert my gaze. Due to the heavy snow, I could only make out his general male form and a brownish coat. The weirdest thing about him was that there didn't seem to be any accumulation of snow on or around him, which was quite a feat, considering everything else was coated in over 50 centimeters of snow.

 nbsp;

Just as I had had enough and was about to switch off, someone else appeared in view. It was a woman wearing a long blue coat. She was walking down the street, one arm shielding her face from the elements while the other stretched in front of her, as one would do in the dark to avoid running into things. The man took a single step towards her. At that moment, a gust of wind obscured the scene in a snowdrift. Once it cleared away, the figures were standing side by side, swaying in unison. I jumped to my feet and power-walked around the apartment, trying to jerk away the creepiness and goosebumps riding up my spine, while muttering "Oh hell no!" a dozen times beneath my breath.

 nbsp;

Over the course of the evening, I periodically checked out the live feed. The figures remained in the frame, but they started moving closer and closer towards the camera, until they were out of sight. I had to change angles to spot them off in the distance, towards a third figure, before losing sight of them completely.

 nbsp;

Maybe I'm freaking out over nothing...but, shit. I'm really spooked. I feel like they're still standing out there somewhere, you know? Has anyone else seen weird people in traffic cams? I can't possibly be the only person who saw these guys: they were there for almost 12 hours! Either way, I'm stuck here until tomorrow, so I'm just going to stay inside where it's safe. If you're in the maritimes, I suggest you do, too.
