 This is some excellent advice. My intelligence has made me bitter and jaded, I'm unfortunately a bit of an idealist so when the world doesn't live up to my ideals I become bitter about it. It's something I've really come to terms with, that it is better to be humble and kind than intelligent and cold. I hope it is something that I only get better at as I get older. That being said I really need to work on myself socially as I still see social interaction as a mechanical thing that other people find organic. 




 I have a ridiculously high standard for myself too, perfectionism is something that often leads me to depression. I have similar mechanical thinking when it comes to social interaction. What comes easy to other people, simply talking, small talk I guess, is a painful thing for me. I have to try to perform small talk. I remember being maybe 12, and attempting to analyze the way the "popular kids" spoke to each other so I could maybe mimic it.  I just can't function it seems. 




 Yeah it brought up a lot of problems in my last romantic relationship when I started experiencing depression again. I have it twofold people like me when I have my shallow mask put up, this fake person who likes what everyone else likes and goes with the flow, but as soon as I ever open up and talk about something "deep" with a person they usually remove themselves from my life. So I just expect people to leave now. 




 I should be in my third year, but I've dropped out because of depression. I was undiagnosed until July this year, which is miserable considering how long I've been suffering from it. At least I'm on the road to getting better now. 




 This is exactly my school experience. I was always beaten down for being ahead of my classmates. It was pretty miserable being a ten year old and having no one else around me understand what I was talking about. 




 Yeah, my family moved at very key developmental stages where I lost all my friends and any kind of social circle I may have been building. I'm more of a failed extrovert than a true introvert. My social life is screwed up. 




 Yeah I know how that feels. I mentioned in another comment how I have a numbing existential pain that follows me around no matter how happy or content I am. 




 I like it a lot, it's very underrated. It's all about the characters in the story, not so much the campy scifi that surrounds it. 




 So far all it has caused me is absolute pain. I'd say I'm socially stunted as a result of intelligence, which has lead me to not trust people. I've dropped out of college not due to lack of success, but because I don't trust myself. I would gladly trade my intelligence for happiness. 




 I relate with everything you just mentioned. Even before I was diagnosed with depression I had this subtle knowledge that felt like I wasn't meant to be happy. I really appreciate the quote at the bottom too, thanks. 




 I like Kurt Vonnegut, he has a sad, uplifting, and absurd way of looking at the world and why people do things. I'd recommend Slaughterhouse-Five. Anything by Mark Twain too, especially his short stories and novellas.  




 I've never been tested, though based on my performance I'd guess I'm considered well above average intelligence. I sympathize with what you're saying at the end. I've ruined a lot of close relationships, I'm isolating myself, and I've dropped out of university (not because I was underperforming just because I can't take life anymore.) I feel like I'm either going to beat this and be the person I've always wanted to be, or I lose and kill myself.  




 It's always at the back of my mind, it's like a numbing anxiety that just leads me back to depression. 




 I was like that through highschool, I grew up in a rural town quite literally in the middle of nowhere. All my teachers always thought I was the smartest kid in the school, and I showed it in the last year, came second highest g.p.a. in my grad class. I spent most of my grad year not depressed, so that may have helped. 




 That's very interesting! thanks for sharing. 




 I like a lot of art films. Andrei Tarkovsky, and Wim Wenders are two of my favorites directors. I think there's a lot in their works that speaks to the INFJ mindset. I especially like the movies Stalker, and Wings of Desire. In mainstream films I really like Bladerunner and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind.   




 Recently my therapist brought up the possibility that I may be gifted. I suffered from depression during my childhood and apart from periods where I was too apathetic to care I did excellent in school. I've heard it said that depression is common amongst people with high intelligence. I just wanted to ask amongst this community and get some perspective.  




 Due to some recent circumstances I've started seeking counselling. I've gone to see a psychiatrist and have been diagnosed with depression and some obsessive compulsive tendencies. From what I've read I think I may have BPD.

I'm a 20 year old male. Since I was little I can remember having serious mood swings. I feel very needy when it comes to other people, I'm also very afraid of them leaving me. I've had attacks of anger or crying when someone leaves me or when big plans change at the last minute. I've lied about random things because I feel insecure. Stupid things like going to a certain concert or something like that. During worse parts of my life I've had suicidal ideation and mixed with feelings of abandonment I have almost self harmed. I have threatened suicide, and have a dramatic streak when I feel I can no longer cope. I have had paranoid thoughts about almost anything you can imagine. I drink to self medicate. I always think that people close to me are just looking for an excuse to bail out of my life, and if they do leave I have major panic attacks. There's has been a pattern of people walking out on me so I'm always ready to drop someone else first, this causes problems in my relationships. I always feel a compulsion to impress people that I meet for the first time. I have fairly idealistic or black and white world views and will devalue people who disagree with me. I've been physically violent with people close to me in the past, and sometimes throw things when I'm angry. When I was younger I had a bad habit of acting out in an attempt to get others to accept me. I was bullied a lot from 8-14, partly because I believe I was already depressed at that age.

 




 I can remember from a young age having spells of crying, or on the verge of crying. I can remember having spells of this even up to around the age of 17 or so. I've always just felt overwhelmed by negative emotions at times, and have gotten inappropriately weepy at times. I'm new to my diagnosis so I'm still trying to find out what fits into my description or not. I can say with confidence that I've suffered from depression and anxiety before this most recent spell, but is this not being able to control negative emotions during circumstantial events fall within the realm of my depression? 




 This entirely, it's such a viscous cycle. All I can think about is how I've been weak and failed in the past. How am I supposed to build confidence when I have such an awful track record; then it just feeds into the next bought of depression.  




 Yeah I get that way too. That's when I can take a lot of work load, it's kind of like "buckle down, weather the storm, you should be in a good place when the feeling comes back just do these things in the mean time." Then it doesn't work out and I end up angry and frustrated.
 




 Thanks a lot for the response. I'm not holding any illusions as to continuing this relationship. The thing that bothers me the most about the whole situation is how out of character this was for me. I've never done things like this before and it makes me sick to think that I ever even got angry at her for anything. I'm just trying to get back to who I was before this year with the added experience. I want to be stable longer before I date anyone else let alone her. She does matter a lot to me and if I've lost her for ever than so be it, but I think that things might be better for the both of us if she knows what's happening with me.

P.S. Thanks a lot, it's been really difficult so far, but at the same time it's good to know where those emotions came from in the first place. I've got a long road ahead of me, but I'm taking off time to make sure that I never act like this again. 




 The people who are suggesting counselling are correct, if you have not yet tried counselling than that is a good direction to go. Anger is not a good way to communicate in a relationship and there needs to be healthier ways to go about it. Anger is generally a sign of other issues, it is not okay that he takes this out on you but both of you should seek counselling. If he doesn't seek counselling or seem to make any improvement than you should start thinking of ways to leave. 




 I've been there before, just many years ago now. I'd say this time was a bit different being out on my own though. University can do a number on you. 




 already did, looking for wider feedback.
 




 When I wasn't actively being depressed it would come out as anger in general. I was overly judgemental to a lot of people and was generally dissatisfied with everything around me. 









 I'm a 20 year old male. I've been suffering from major depression for years and only over the past few months have I actually been diagnosed. I've found with my depression I have periods of anxiety that lead to depression, which I eventually push down so I can actually function. So I'm severely depressed at the same time as being able to maintain a fairly substantial work load. That being said I can only focus on my work load anything else is too much. Eventually my depression starts coming out again and the facade that I put up cracks. It usually starts to break down after a few months with angry outbursts, crying randomly and then suicidal ideation until I'm full on depressed again.  

So has anyone else felt this way before. That you can push down your depression for a period of time but it ends up coming out again as anger, anxiety or frustration? 




 Thanks a lot for this. I'm not looking to get her back, I'd be lying if I said that's not what I would like, but I'm not expecting anything and I need to get healthy before I can date anyone again. I just want her to know that I'm sorry and that nothing that happened was her fault. She didn't mention any of this stuff when we broke up, even though I asked. I guess she didn't feel it was needed. Anyway, I'm sure she knows something is up with me, it was pretty obvious looking back, but for me it wasn't at the time. I just don't know how to talk to her about it. I mean calling her up and being like "Hey haven't talked in a while, I've been diagnosed with a mental illness, sorry for all the garbage I put you through" seems a little forward. Thanks for the response. 




 Me and my ex dated for 2.5 years we broke up in april; before we started dating we'd been friends for 3 years I'm 20, she's 21. I didn't take care of myself and I treated her like garbage. She has so many completely valid reasons to never want to speak to me again. I became completely focused on school without any regard to anything else, it was all I could handle. I had what I would call an existential crisis that triggered clinical depression. I went to a counsellor early on when i was feeling a lot of anxiety, they told me I should speak with a philosopher. I wasn't sleeping at night, wasn't eating, was missing showering every other day, and falling asleep in the afternoon or in class. Lost interest in everything I enjoy, was a snob to my friends, and walked around with a chip on my shoulder.
 
I did so many things that were absolutely crazy, and obviously signs that something was seriously wrong with me, but I didn't do anything about it at the time. I became a complete misanthrope, I hated everybody and criticized everyone including her parents. I became dependent on her. In the last few months we ended up fighting a lot and I almost hit her, like raised my hand and said I wanted to, but didn't. I did end up shoving her once. I'm so ashamed about what happened. But wait there's more. I became kind of semi-controlling and I was jealous of one of her guy friends, who I probably was right about but I let how I felt affect me too much. I definitely crossed the line with that too, I just felt like I wasn't good enough at all. I didn't do enough for her birthday and valentine's day. It was just dinner, flowers, and a gift but I felt I should have done more. During all of this I was spending a lot of time playing video games because without realizing it I couldn't deal with my own life.

During a panic attack I had I almost cut myself, I've never done something like that before it was crazy, she stopped me from doing that. I was off handedly mentioning killing myself like an "maybe I should just kill myself then I wouldn't have to deal with" ____ whatever problem I was having. 

After she broke up with me at the end of the school year, I didn't leave my apartment for 2 weeks, I just cried. I couldn't piece things together, I didn't talk to anyone I was just dead. It took me a month to realize how messed up I had been. I've since gone in and had pscyhiatric assessment done. I've been diagnosed with severe major depression. I'm seeing a therapist and am on medication.

I've never been like this before, I've always been a patient, caring and loving person. I was the one who could take the pressure in our relationship, but I lost it. This past year has been so out of character it's difficult to describe. Apparently my friend's and family has been very worried about me but didn't say anything.

Me and my ex haven't been speaking very often since the break up. She wanted to stay friends (for some reason I don't understand) but I told her that we both needed space. She said that she'd be there if I needed anything. I told her I wouldn't. Anyway, now I've dropped out of college for this year while I get my head back together. 

Do you think that I should tell this girl why I acted the way I did? I'm feel so ashamed about what's happened, I have a hard time believing it myself.  She was my best friend for five years and the last 9 months have completely ruined that. 

TL;DR: I've been diagnosed with severe depression. I've acted like a monster for almost a year, my ex left me with good reason. I feel like I should talk to my ex and at least give her an explanation for why I acted the way I did. 
























 When I reach rock bottom with a depressive episode I find that my social boundaries almost completely disappear. I talk to people I wouldn't otherwise talk to about pretty deep, or personal stuff. It's almost as though I just have to dump my negative thoughts on people close to me, to help me carry some of the weight. Most of the time it's alright I have people who I can talk to but I often have a hard time internalizing those horrible emotions when I'm at the lowest of the lows. Do any of you experience this too? 




 yeah I understand that completely, I'm 20 and have been called an old soul so many times I can't count it. I'm not a religious person and don't actually entertain the idea of reincarnation, but I've always identified with the idea of having been around the block a few times.  




 Yeah I did the same thing, it was always trying to push it as far down as possible. I think that by doing so at a young age it actually caused my depression to be worse now. I can remember doing some things in school that were really not alright, and just biting my tongue so I didn't cry sometimes. I've been trying to work very hard at exercising as a way of wasting the energy those negative emotions cause. 

I'm really sorry to hear that you have a problem that makes exercising dangerous. I can't imagine how I'd manage without. 




 Wow that's horrible, I'm sorry to hear it's taking so long. I don't know how I got an appointment so fast. 




 I've become much more empathetic since realizing I was struggling with depression and seeking treatment. Before that though I was about as bitter and jaded as you can possibly get. 




 about a week and a half. 




 Really?, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and an anxiety disorder after my first appointment with my Psychiatrist and I'm from Canada. 




 Thanks a lot for the recommendation. I have to say that now that I know I'm depressed and that I've been seeking treatment I don't feel as cold and jaded as I did before. I know where those negative feelings and coldness was coming from now so I can manage it better. At the same time there is a degree of realism in the way I thought before. For instance most people feign empathy for things happening in other countries, though it is almost impossible for them on a human behavioural level to actually care because they have no invested interest. I guess it's kind of stuff like that that still hangs around in my head, but I've been trying to empathize more as a part of managing my depression. 




 Oh man I understand where you're coming from a lot. I am absolutely polite and helpful to almost everybody, even when I am having a major depressive episode. People have a tendency to take advantage of me this way. I'm very jaded about almost everything though, politics, philosophy, everything. When you read enough, the world becomes horribly small and rather depressing, especially when you read a lot into sociology and philosophy. 

I think that more often than not I'm myself only around strangers, or drunk. Everything else feels like maintenance a lot of the time, I feel like I need to keep a facade to keep friends. 
 




 For me it may have very well have been a lot of anxiety I had as a kid. I can just remember very clearly either saying horribly cynical things, or just crying in class. I got into fights every now and then but I never started them. I just remember being incredibly weepy at times, or over emotional. I didn't cause a lot of trouble, but I did and said some pretty morose stuff at a young age. 




 No it was just about the way I felt about it, that I was pissed off enough about how stupid I felt people were that I felt I had to go talk some sense into the people handing out stickers, instead of ignoring it. Perhaps that wasn't the best example, but I did things like shot people down in class discussions and was just a huge asshole about things. I'm not like that when I'm not in a depressive episode so I was just wondering if other people shared that experience. 




 I relate a lot to this. I'm not out of the woods, but I've definitely been an ass to people close to me. 




 My depression has definitely left me a bitter and less empathetic person than I was before I became depressed. I've become sort of dismissive of most things that other people seem to get very swept up in. I honestly have admitted to myself that I don't have the emotional resources to care about what happens in the rest of the world anymore. I know it's not good that there is war in Syria and drought in Africa, but I just find myself not giving a damn. I actually have started thinking that most peoples empathy for these sort of things is just a big show they put on. 

For example, with the whole Kony 2012 thing, I ripped into that like there was no tomorrow, being bitter and jaded at what seemed like sentimental schlock. It wouldn't usually bother me, I'd ignore it and let it go, but I actually went to the booth some students had set up at my college and basically drilled them to see if they knew what they were talking about, mostly they didn't. 

I don't know, I just feel more bitter, jaded, and down right cynical than ever. Do any of you get the same thing? 




 I've recently been diagnosed with depression and looking back on my personal history I've been depressed since a fairly young age. Probably since I was 9-10. My Psychiatrist and Psychologist both agree that I experienced childhood depression. I can remember being just randomly irritable at times where it wasn't appropriate, or acting out in other ways. I remember just having fits when I was younger that looking back corresponded with periods of anxiety and depression.  




 Yeah we've talked about it quite a bit now, and have decided to talk on a semi regular basis. This was her idea not mine, I've already told her I have no idea why she'd want to speak to me again. So I guess that's good, she's the one who is really pushing to continue at least a friendship. Though I'm not trying to use the depression as an excuse, I think it's fair to say that I only ever behaved in that way while depressed, never before or after. She says that it doesn't bother her and that it's nice that there's some explanation there. 




 Yeah, I went in again to have a visit with the psychiatrist I've been seeing, he was able to better explain what he thought my issues are. I'm still not 100% on it, because I know I've had weird hyper/irritable episodes in the past, but he said most of them seem to be driven by anxiety rather than a mood state. I'm going to keep an eye out for symptoms regardless, and I've been mood charting for the depression that I have been diagnosed with, so I guess time will tell. Thanks for the response. 




 I often feel that humans live very unnaturally, that humans aren't supposed to live in massive groups of hundreds of thousands. I wouldn't say that I'm a primitivist, just that I feel the way things are set up which is for a maximum productivity society hurts the human mind that it influences. Things like television and consumerism, too much information always bombarding you even if you try to avoid it. Humans are built for living in smaller family groups, not giant grids with thousands. I guess that's why living in an apartment building feels like a prison to me. 




 Just that it seemed that these episodes were driven more by anxiety than anything else. I made it clear that I felt the anxiety was more of a symptom than a driver, but he said it seemed the other way. I can't see how an inflated self esteem and grandiose thinking could come from anxiety. In some cases I'd agree with him, not so much in others. 




 Some have an evening, others have lasted about a month. 




 Yeah I make a lot of comments about my intelligence. Yeah, no one suspected that I was depressed, maybe a bit neurotic, but nothing more than that. I built a persona that was the opposite of how I was feeling, I made comments about my looks and intelligence, and was pretty haughty sometimes. It was all just made up to counter the scales. 




 Totally agree. I'd say I come off as very high strung and full of myself, **especially** when meeting new people. I figure that I have to come off as a dominate personality as a confident type personality, but it's all just an act, it hasn't done me any favours. 




 I think we're on the same page, I just took it to a bit of an extreme. I think there's a certain level of depersonalization that goes along with it. I know I just feel like a pit behind the "face" that I put up, and recently I haven't been able to muster the energy to keep it going, and when I could keep it up. When I could keep it up, it would just be the most fake, arrogant, manufactured face you could possibly imagine, as soon as I got home it just disappeared. 




 Yeah that's kind of where I am. I've just spent a year acting kind of like this without really realizing what I was dealing with. 




 I've discovered that I show a fake kind of self confidence in an attempt to hide how horrible I really feel. It's almost as though I'm trying to convince myself I'm someone impressive when I know that I'm really not. It sort of happens more often during periods where I feel horrible about myself. I can convince myself to act self confident even though I'm not. It feels like an equal and opposite reaction to the depression, sort of like well if you feel like crap inside act like you're not outside. Actually it's more in line with the feeling, if you feel horrible inside, devalue everything around you so you feel better. I end up being horribly judgemental and condescending.  




 It's actually terrifying how much like the people in Brave New World a lot of people really are. I'm a horrible idealist who tortures himself with thoughts of "real happiness" or "true beauty." I'm very much starting to believe those things are unattainable and are just fantastic delusions of what's really possible. Off topic, but it does cause me a great deal of strife and unhappiness. I wish I didn't think about these things, I wish I could be content. 




 Actually I brought this movie to my exgirlfriend, saying how amused I was at the concept. That's when I realized I'd become one seriously bitter, angry, misanthrope, and it wasn't 3 months later that I started going to therapy. 

edit: I suppose I should actually reply to your ideas. I've learned not to hate the people who I think are awful and greedy, most of the time they don't know any better. Is it something to lament? yes, is it something I can change? probably not. You see, the world has become a very ugly place, and, I believe, people by and large have also become that way. We live in a world where there are weapons that can destroy whole cities in the blink of an eye. The situation, overall, has become rather bleak, cheap, and ugly, and many people have adapted to reflect this. There are reasons why I find art so lacking in it's ability to provide me comfort or catharsis, it's because there is no group of words, images, or notes that can extinguish the existential anguish that comes from living in our time. A time when everything could be moving toward a hopeful, beautiful future full of peace and promise, but so often falls short of that ideal.  So, while I used to resent those who act horribly or choose to distract themselves and ignore, I now simply lament the state of things.  




 I used to say even worse stuff, I'd off handedly mention killing myself without realizing that saying something like that is inappropriate. I find that trying to keep a positive frame of mind in general has helped, I don't say stuff like that anymore.  




 I'm 20 so I've spent some time in university, but all of my professors knew my name in classes of 50-200. In highschool a lot of my classes like Literature, History and Religion were more or less dialogues between me and the teacher. 




 When I was ten I read the lord of the rings to myself and understood it. I can remember being in grade 6 and reading 1984 by george orwell because I was done all my work. My teacher "made an example of me" and sent me to the principal's office where I then told them I had been sent there for reading in class. I spent the rest of the class happily reading in the comfy chairs at the principal's office. I remember trying to explain the roman senate to a bunch of eleven year olds in a social studies class. 

In my highschool years I basically had free roam to come and go as I pleased because most of the teachers knew it was a waste of time for me to actually attend class. I had a real problem with accidentally talking down to people which obviously didn't gain me any friends. 




 I just don't think that society has the infrastructure to tend to the needs of people with exceptional intelligence. People with higher intellects are usually more emotionally sensitive as well. So when an intelligent child, teenager or young adult experiences the turmoil that comes along with a generally uncaring world they have nothing to truly help or steady them. 
























 I had more or less the same thing happen to my relationship with my ex. She actually did end up leaving me for someone else and now I have lost my best friend. 

OP I would caution against it based on my personal experience. I'm sure that it could work out for you but for me it ended really badly and led to a lot of resentment. She just could never truly see me as more than a friend and I spent the last half of the relationship feeling like a place holder. All the best, good luck. 




 thanks, I was feeling a little of it today, but not as much by any means. I just felt really out of sorts last night and was irritable and scared so I went to the hospital. I probably wasted their time, but I was feeling pretty bad last night. 




 Right on thanks for sharing. I know personally that I have a lot of the symptoms of a person suffering from bipolar disorder, but like you they seem to think my agitation states are anxiety based. I'm having a bit of a hard time taking their word for it because they even admit there is a similarity. My pdoc has also told me that I'm probably Obsessive only OCD. 




 Do you mind if I ask what your diagnosis is? do you just have depression? I'm sort of afraid that my reaction might be a result of something worse. 




 I started the abilify about a month ago at 2 mg, but they bumped me up to a couple of weeks ago. Since then I experienced exactly what you did, feeling like the bones in my legs were trying to escape or that my skin was crawling. I couldn't sit down because my legs were jittery. I have an appointment with my Pdoc on thursday, but I'm not taking any more ability till then. I didn't take it after getting back from the hospital last night and I've had no restlessness or irritability. 




 Went to the hospital last night because I was having a severe panic attack and couldn't stop my legs from moving. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have been prescribed 5mg of abilify and 45 mg of mirtazapine for anxiety and depression. For the last few days I haven't been able to get my legs to stop moving and have been having terrible anxiety that's keeping me awake. You know the kind where it's everything stupid you've ever done all at once. Anyway I had a panic attack and drove myself to the hospital because I felt very out of sorts. They prescribed me seroquel on top of what I'm already dealing with so that I could get to sleep. I was just wondering if there are other people here who have experience using anti-psychotics to fight depression and anxiety. Do my doctors think I have something worse and are just not telling me yet? Do you have any experience with abilify or seroquel? 




 Yup, that's what it's like exactly. I felt like I no master what me and everyone else did it was all trivial 




 Hi /r/depression. I've found during my battles with depression that I tend to devalue everything around me in an effort to manage my negative emotions. I criticize family, friends, my own interests, basically everything in an effort to bring things down to my level (not on purpose but it still happens.) Have any of you experienced this? I think it's a kind of anhedonia where I not only don't find pleasure in things but I have to devalue them as well. Sort of like there must be a reason I don't get pleasure from those things or people anymore. If any of you share this kind of behaviour I'd love to hear from you. Thanks. 




 my bad, was meant for /r/depression  thanks
 




 Hi /r/depression so here's my story. Me and my ex girlfriend broke up last may, it was a bad split she started dating again very soon afterward. I was dealing with a serious episode of depression that I'm still fighting and was made worse by the breakup. Towards the end of the relationship there were a some bad fights, suffice it to say my depression had a lot to do with why we weren't working. 

Since then I've moved back home with my parents so I can get my head on straight. After months of not talking to each other me and my ex are working on our friendship again and seeing where that goes. She brought up if I was seeing anybody else and I told her I wasn't, that I needed to get my head on straight first. I also told her that I might be moving back to the same city as her and she seemed excited by that news. 

The conversation really got me thinking, will I ever be okay enough to really be in a relationship with someone else? I feel like my partner consumes me and I become a codependant mess. I didn't even know who I was after me and my ex split we'd been together so long. 

It really scares me, I have bad anxiety too and I can't stop thinking of everything I've ever done wrong, even going back to kindergarden, my memory is a real curse. I want to be able to be there for someone else and have a real relationship someday, but I'm afraid I'll just fall apart again and won't know it until it's too late. 

What am I supposed to do? I lost my perfect girl to this disease I'm fighting, I don't know what to say to people when they ask how I'm doing, I feel cloudy all the time because of the medication I'm on. 

I suffered from depression and anxiety as a child and through my teenage years, there may have been one year in the last 10 that I haven't felt depressed (basically 10 onward I've been struggling) I don't know what normal feels like, am I so broken? I just don't know what to do or say anymore. 

I wish I could fix things with my ex, but I need to fix me first, and I don't know how long that'll take. I wish I could go back to school but I'm afraid the stress might kill me. I don't know it's all too much.

If any of you have been in a similar circumstance please lend some advice, I'm so far up a creek without a paddle I'm pretty much looking at the ocean.  




 wasn't indoors, was next to the garage. still bad. 




 I have depression and have been thinking about everything I've ever done wrong so here is the whole god damn fucking list of things I can't get out of my head.

Number 1. 
- When I was younger I was really really insecure and wanted to impress other kids, especially moving to a new town and not knowing many people. I never hit anyone but I did get in a few scuffles with kids who didn't deserve it because other kids were egging me on. Man I felt so bad, because I know what it's like to get picked on. FUCK. I'm sorry. 13 years old

Number 2. Told off some kids at soccer practice because they were being jerks about another kids accent. I was super mean and one of them started crying. Their parents heard me.  8 years old

 
Number 3. Made fun of a handicap kid once because he was acting out and making a scene. His sister heard what I said and started crying. FUCK FUCK FUCK. I'm sorry. 11 years old

Number 4. Once I went on a trip to Europe but our plane got delayed for stupid reasons so I missed a day on the trip and I got pissed at the lady at the airport who seriously couldn't have done anything about it. Didn't make a bit of a scene. FUCK. 16 years old.

Number 5. Trying to impress people, I cheated in my fourth grade chess tournament. Everyone knew I did too. Still lost. 10 years old.

Number 6. Made fun of a kid in front of his mom (who was a substitute teacher) she made me explain why I did that to her. Didn't know she was in ear shot. FUCK.

Number 7. Had a stupid obsession crush on a girl when I was fourteen. When she went to the dance with another guy after turning down my invitation I cried in the bathroom. damn it.

Number 8. Moved again, trying to impress people. Told a bunch of lies which include. Saying I had a friend who committed suicide. Saying I had friends who did all kinds of drugs before moving. I'm such an idiot. fourteen years old.

Number 9. Lit a copy of "The Pearl" by john Steinbeck on fire (with gasoline) for being too straight forward with it's meaning and just a miserable book. Almost burned down my parent's garage. 16 years old.

Number 10. While drunk described to my ex girlfriend's mom how I would have liked to beat up my ex's childhood friend for being such an ass on the school trip to Europe (It was holocaust tour he was an ass). Made a horrible impression. 17 years old.

Number 11. Spent a summer at my Aunt's place was a moody angry teenager the whole time. Watched porn on the family computer, which they all completely knew about. Lied about where I was going sometimes. 15 years old.  Damn it.

Number 12. When george bush visited my state I was in class and watching it on tv, when the motorcade went by the cameras I said "common snipers!" teacher screamed at me. I was a very opinionated 12 year old. I got sent to the principle's office. 12 years old

Number 13. Got drunk and chased my friends around, got sick and made a scene. 16 years old.

Number 14. Lied about going to a concert, when asked about specifics by someone who went I lied and they called me out on not going. So fucking awful. 19 years old.

Anyway that's all I've got for now FUCK. 




 yeah I'm on medication now, and I've been feeling much better. I've also been exercising and doing mindfulness meditation so I can be very aware of how I'm feeling. 




 I guess I'm really trying to figure out which part of the anger was "me" and which part was caused by the depression. It was very out of character for me to act in that way. I accept that I'm always responsible. I guess I'm more interested in cause and identity. 




 I was hesitant starting off, but I'm feeling a lot better about it. My thoughts are clearer, I'm sleeping better, I have an appetite again, I'm not being overly irritated or angry at my loved ones and I haven't experienced any side effects that I've noticed. So it feels great to not be as angry, I feel like I'm getting back to my old self. The therapy is helping a lot too, but I'm functioning now in the meantime.  




 yeah I'm in therapy and on medication. Since I've been on medication I've been very collected and haven't gotten angry whatsoever. Everyone says that it's so out of character for me. 




 because I feel guilty and embarrassed. I know I'm responsible, but more is it objectively a result of the depression. I was never like this when not depressed. I guess I'm just trying to figure out where that behaviour came from and to hear other people's experience with it. 




 You're entirely right. 




 I've had a few anger/rage episodes which both my psychologist and psychiatrist have said are a result of my depression. I've lashed out at some people close to me and I feel a great amount of guilt about what happened. I know it's not an excuse for my actions by any means, but how responsible do you think we are for anger as a result of our depression. Is it really "us" or is it the depression? 




 Seriously, depression can cause this, my depression caused me to be a complete asshole for almost an entire year to my now ex-gf. I honestly didn't know what I was dealing with, I was too busy/stressed to care. I didn't take care of myself, was agressive, and generally frustrated/pissed off. Seriously talk to him about this, I know for me a lot of my anger was a kind of call for help. Don't jump to conclusions, but sit down and talk to him about it. Seeing a counsellor would probably help the situation either way. 




 Hey man, we've got similar stories. My depression and the anger it caused definitely led to the end of my relationship with my girlfriend. I had a whole week were I basically fell of the face of the earth after we had some fights. It's a rough road man, I wish my girlfriend had come back, but at the same time I don't think I'm in any state to date right now. 




 I feel like I'm a different species all the time. The only way I can function is by putting up a front, it's pretty miserable. 




 I'm dealing with pretty bad depression, that for the most part stems from those kind of reactions. I always think of all the stupid things I've done and it just brings me down.
 




 Yea, I'm much more reeled in than I was at a young age. Unless I've been drinking, but I think that's just because it takes my anxiety away. 




 yup that's it exactly, I would be really hesitant to meet anybody but as soon as that passed I'd be overly friendly and energetic. Usually resulting in being called weird or annoying. 




 Has your anxiety ever caused you to act out? I can remember from a very young age always trying to impress other people because I felt a huge amount of anxiety regarding "fitting in." I'd do stuff just a little bit over the top so that people would recognize me, or I'd inflate stories in an attempt to get people to like me. All of my acting out of course led only to more anxiety. 




 It feels like a weight pushing down on me just enough to make me hate everything. It makes my thoughts loud, cold, and for the most part logical. I don't cry, it's just numbness, it feels like pressure. You know that feeling you get when you know you've hurt yourself badly like a deep cut or really bad bruise and it's so bad you can't even feel it, well it's like that all the time. Sometimes I get sick of feeling like this, I can only take stuffing it down so long, I used to get angry quite a lot, not these days but I used to. It was just a horrible alternative to feeling nothing. 




 I have a very hard time relating to people my own age, it's pretty miserable. I can remember being 10 and the only people who I really enjoyed talking to were my teachers. It's still sort of that way, I've been asked to have coffee and chat by a few of my professors because they don't feel I'm operating at an undergraduate level. I can't really relate to the whole "college life" experience or people my own age because I feel like  I've already moved passed that part of my life.

I'd probably trade the intelligence and wisdom/hyper-awareness for better sociability and happiness. I'm not sure that I can have both intelligence and happiness, I just wish I got along better with people. 




 Classical piano for 15 years. I need music as a stress relief and have realized that it has to remain that way for me. I tried some university education with music and although I did very well my perfectionism ruined it for me and I couldn't listen to music for almost a year afterwards.  




 I was going to say "My body is a cage" but it was already posted. "If I Ever Feel Better" by Phoenix is pretty accurate.  
























 I can understand why someone would be hesitant. I was always very against taking medication personally but I hit a very rough patch this summer and saw how horrible I'd been acting. At that point I was willing to admit that some medication would help me. 




 all of my mental illness has come from times where I was alone. I've had deep existential self loathing from times where I been more or less isolated. I don't think I like myself very much and it can be very frightening.  




 It's awful, it gives you hope, but you know what's happening and you don't want to be alone.  




 I was to put it lightly a jerk to everyone I know. I was condescending, cynical and sometimes belittling. I've worked on it a lot I lost a lot of good people in the mean time. I've found the medication that I've been taking takes the edge off of my "chip on the shoulder" attitude. 




 I think we both "liked" each other for a long time before we actually started dating. We were best friends because we were both sort of a little outcast from everyone else in highschool. We were both art types so we got along really well.  I asked her out at the end of grade 11 and she said no, so I went on and met some other girls had a really fun summer, I come back the following fall and she hijacks me in her car and basically tells me that we're dating "before any other girl snatches me up." We lost our virginities to each other and I seriously doubt I could find another girl like her.

We dated for two and half years, she was someone who I felt like I could be in my own skin around. We went to school in the same city and spent almost all of our time together. Then my depression and anxiety started, I ended up taking it out on her (jealousy, anger, general insecurity) which wasn't fair and she deserved so much better. It's difficult to show love and trust to someone when you don't love and trust yourself.

She fell in love with someone else and now they're dating. I'm still pretty wrecked up about it, and the worst part is knowing that it's all my fault. I moved home because I need to get my head sorted so we don't live in the same city anymore. We still talk every few weeks over skype, but I feel incredibly insincere and guilty. I miss her every day. 
 




 I spent about a year on a high horse because I started using biting ice cold rational to criticize basically the way most people go on with their lives. We entertain and distract ourselves to death and I refused to participate for almost a year. I tried to better myself because the only other course of action was passivity. My rationale was supported by a lot of academic research and personal experience. Having this depressing hypercritical worldview did make me quite the elitist because no one else would bother to do the research and work that I'd done to achieve what appears to be so evident.

I'm not sure what to make of my ideas anymore, they seem true and seem like the right course of action, but they isolated me from all my friends and loved ones. I've now decided to tone myself down so that maybe I can be happy again someday. 




 Pushed everyone away and definitely not for their own benefit. I thought that everyone didn't want or need me. My ex left me ( she'd been my best friend for several years) and I've now moved across the country to mostly isolate myself. I'm starting to make friends here now but I've had months alone. 




 I'd definitely participate. This sounds like a great idea. 




 Me and my ex broke up in May of this year. We'd been dating for 2.5 years and had been friends for 5. We were each others first relationship. It was a bad split, I was dealing with depression, we weren't communicating well, I took my depression out on her and said/did somethings that were highly inappropriate, I'm pretty sure we were both feeling trapped. 

She broke up with me and I really tried to keep a persona of being cool and alright with the breakup, that I was doing alright and moving on. The truth was that I hadn't been sleeping or eating and that I started seeing a therapist to get my depression under control. My ex started dating someone else a few weeks of us splitting up (I'd had my suspicions about this guy before we split up) 

Over the summer I did the shitty ex thing and sent her an angry letter telling her she was selfish and that she never cared about me in the first place. This came from a very unhealthy place and I regret sending it a lot. I was really miserable. Anyway, I decided I wasn't going back to university in the same city as her and that I was going to take the year off to pull myself back together. 

When she heard from friends that I wasn't doing well she called me and asked me point blank if I was alright. I told her straight up that I wasn't, that I'd been dealing with a lot of guilt about how I'd treated her in the last few months of our relationship and how wrong headed I'd been. I told her that I'd been dealing with depression and that I hoped it helped to explain some of my behaviour. 

Since then she contacts me fairly often and we have long conversations like the kind we had when we were together. I also find it odd that she regularly calls me on a Friday or Saturday night and talks with me for a whole evening. A few weeks ago she texted me 4 times and then finally called me because she wanted to send me a christmas card.

There were problems in our relationship, there were things that I wasn't happy with and obviously there were things that she wasn't happy with, but I feel that our relationship fell apart as a mix of hitting a 2 year down point and my depression. This time last year we were talking about moving in together. I think a lot of what happened was us failing to take our relationship to the next level. There were times where I was almost ready to break it off with her too.

We still talk, I don't know whether she's still dating that other guy, I don't think it's appropriate for me to ask. I'm doing my best to step away from the effects of the breakup, I've made new friends in the city where I'm living now, I've gone on dates, I've been seeing my therapist and have been making progress with fighting my depression.

I need to work on myself, I need to meet new people, date new people, I need to drive back my depression. But, at the same time, I'd be lying if I said that I don't have any sort of small idea that me and her might try again some time, when we're both at better more mature places in our lives.
 
The only thing is I can't be sure that she isn't just contacting me out of pity. Would you keep in contact with someone just because  She seems to be fairly genuine about things as they are. I guess I'm just looking for a bit of input on why you think someone would stay in contact with their ex the way she seems fairly adamantly trying to stay in contact with me. 

TL;DR: Had a bad split with first girlfriend, she left me and started dating fairly soon afterwards. Months later we are trying to stay friends and she is definitely making an effort to keep me fairly close. Why do you think that is?
 




 You need to get somewhere safe and away from him. I'm sorry, I'm sure you love him on his fair weather days, but what he is doing is not okay whatsoever. For your own well being. 




 I do it all the time, in fact, I'd go as far to say I've created a charming, funny and extroverted character that I use as a buffer between myself and the outside world. I smile, I joke, I flirt, I wouldn't say it's manic like in bipolar disorder, but it's a falsity that I use to protect myself.

At work today a customer told me that I do such a good job making people happy, that I'm a positive for everyone that comes into the cafe I work at. I spent most of my day fantasizing about killing myself. 

Sorry, this probably hasn't been helpful at all. 




 Yeah, that's unacceptable behaviour on his part, make it clear to him that if this doesn't improve than you're gone. Accusing you of cheating without the smallest piece of evidence is ridiculous and dramatic and you should tell him that. 




 Yeah.. I think relationships are a little more complicated than you make them out to be. Not to say that his behaviour is acceptable, it isn't, but I think you're stretching a little bit.

 Should she be careful incase his behaviour doesn't improve. yes. Is it helpful to tell her that this guy *will* destroy her life, probably not. 




 I will agree with other posters that your boyfriend's behaviour is unacceptably invasive, but at the same time I do, as a man, sympathize with that kind of insecurity. I'm of the school of thought that most single males have less than platonic goals if they start showing interest in a girl who is in a relationship. It's an easy assumption and more often than not it's right. 

All that being said you're boyfriend is obviously not just being the normal level of defensive, he's taking it way too far. You shouldn't have to show him all the past of your electronic communication if you don't want to, that's a boundary that you've set.  I'm not usually one to dish out the "break up" advice which is often given ad nauseum on this subreddt, but if your boyfriend doesn't seriously take your feelings on this into consideration and continues to freak out, I don't think you'll have many more directions to take. If you've communicated your issue with his behaviour to him, and he hasn't tried to compromise to achieve a healthy middle ground than it's probably time to move on.

This is coming from someone who's ex-girlfriend actually left me for a "guy friend" so I hope that I'm a tempered response.  




 Seriously, you're both wrong, you pushed him, he hit you in the leg. Learn to not fight like children or don't be in a relationship, simple.  




 People with depression, particularly males, often do exhibit increased aggression or irritability. If OP's bf is depressed his behaviour isn't entirely out of place. 




 I have isolated myself. I've moved across the country to live with my parents in a city I don't know. I am alone, the only people I talk to on a semiregular basis are people from work and my exgirlfriend. She left me for someone else, I was a shitty boyfriend, I was desperate and afraid. I've told her about my depression, and how I wish I'd known I was depressed at the time. I wish I could talk to her more often, or open up and be candid with her, I really miss her. I know I won't find someone as unique and special as her. I feel cold and alone. I imagine this is a similar feeling to being caught in the wilderness, knowing you're going to freeze to death, but having no way of stopping it. I've tried so hard to get out of this, I've been exercising, writing, seeing a therapist, taking medication, I just can't make it stop. No one values me, I think my ex only talks to me out of pity, I'm unneeded, replaceable, and unhappy.   




 I miss you, there isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about you. After all of these months of putting together the pieces, like an expert piecing back together a plane after a horrible crash, I finally have a good picture and can say that this was all my fault. If I could see you now I'd hug you and tell you how sorry I am, and that I don't really know what to do or who I am right now but I'm trying anyway. I never imagined that we'd end up this way, or that I'd be where I am right now. I know you've found love with someone else and all I can think is how much you deserve someone who's better than me. How were you ever supposed to love me when I can't love myself?, when deep down I'm so fundamentally twisted up inside. You have a good heart to have ever been able to love someone like me. You probably don't think too kindly of me these days, the only person to blame for that is me. 

These days I don't know if I'll ever be able to stand on my own two feet again. We talk now and then, but I don't know if I've let on how beaten out of the race I really am. So many "what ifs" run through my brain everyday; "What if I hadn't gotten sick?" "What if I'd been more patient" "What if I wasn't scared." We both wish I could just leave it in the past and move forward, but I just can't. I'm too afraid.

I miss coming home to you, I miss watching movies, just talking in the shower and going for walks through the nice end of town. I miss how we'd snuggle close to each other before falling asleep, how your legs and arms would get cold so you'd curl around me. I miss when it was just me and you under blankets in the backs of cars and listening to songs from the 80's. I miss you calling me late at night to ask if I wanted to go smoke cigars in the rain and then waiting for me to kiss you. 

All of that seems so far away now, like a dream, like something that never happened. I've lost you, you're so far away now, and I'm so afraid that I'm losing myself too. All I feel is guilt, anger and remorse, it's only fitting that I'm the source of my own misery. I'm cold, bitter, and a worse man than I was before, maybe I've always been worse. I really hope you find real happiness, and no matter what happens to me, if I don't pull myself back, and can never stand by on my own again, it's not because of you.



 




 Yeah with pop music (rock, trance, top 40, any of that stuff) they'd be somewhere between bored and revolted. 




 I've started smoking over the past year because, A) I really like the flavour, it's relaxing and lets me think alone and B) I know that it might possibly kill me one of these days. I've never self harmed, but this is a much more passive way of doing so I suppose and that seems to suit me. 




 I'm actually a he, and was dating a she. I was feeling very well at the time, I was beginning my last year of high school felt like I finally had something to look forward to. She was my best friend and I'd started to have feelings for her. We were together for two years, I became depressed during my first year of university, started hating myself, didn't treat her as well as I should have, this was before I was diagnosed. She broke up with me, and with good reason. I've since started getting help and am trying to do better, but I'm in no condition to be in a relationship with anybody. 




 Sounds a lot like depression to me. I've been diagnosed and can really relate to the completely not feeling anything, as well as the rare anger episode. For me, the anger feels like something other than the nothingness so it's difficult to control when it does happen. If you're feeling this way please go talk to someone and find some help. 




 Well from my own personal experience I was experiencing a brief period off feeling normal when I started a relationship with my now ex. I had my most severe episode of depression and was entirely undiagnosed. It really did screw up my relationship, I've done so many things that I regret. I don't know how I'd even go about starting a relationship now.  




 I ended up resenting my ex like crazy, which was a painful situation in and of itself, while we were dating. Coincidentally, she was really pushing for us to move in together earlier this year, but I said it wasn't a good time for multiple reasons. I'm glad that I didn't have to struggle through a living situation as well, just the emotional turmoil. I hope things work out for you. 




 I was just on the receiving end of this with my ex. She wasted my time for 2 years when I could have been meeting new girls and having fun in college. She led me on for a very, very long time and then ended up leaving me high and dry when someone else came along. You want to fuck someone up badly, do that. Please by all means break up with him, just don't be surprised if he never talks to you again. 




 I think death by spiders is fairly high up there on the list of ways I don't want to die. 




 Yeah, I find when I'm low I usually get pretty paranoid, especially about spiders. I actually slept with the light on for a few months because I was terrified there would be a spider somewhere near me. I've always had trouble with paranoia and falling asleep though, I'm a 20 years old and more or less scared of the dark, when I'm depressed anyway. 




 It's strange actually, me and my psychologist have both brought it that I probably don't know how to conduct myself in a normal way. I'm dysfunctional even when I am feeling alright because I don't know how to manage not feeling horrible. I've lived with depression so long that if I ever want to be healthy I have to learn how to conduct myself when I'm not feeling that way. 




 Yeah, that'd get you started. I really don't have any answers for you, all I can say is don't be too hard on yourself, don't let it consume you, realize that even if there is no grand scheme objective meaning that you can still apply meaning to things and people. Hopefully you come out of your crisis on the other end a more complete and aware person. 

The best advice I can give is to be aware of your limitations and realize the potential you have. As a human you are limited and it's a difficult thing to accept. Best of luck. 




 Well it'd probably help if you describe your existential crisis a little more. I mean, what started it? have you been reading philosophy/literature? 

 I don't think it's something everyone goes through, I think it requires a certain level of introspection that a lot of people lack. There is a difference between that phase where you're trying to figure out what you want to do for a career and an existential crisis. 

I will say that if you're having a full blown existential crisis then you probably won't find a solid answer to your questions. What you will find is a cornucopia of different thoughts and ways of conducting a life. Take what you find enriching and leave the rest
