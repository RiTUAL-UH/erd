Link in their forums. whitelisting is just joining the forums.

I love the guns, the vehicles wouldnt work.. especially the half track which is way OP. But the guns rock and are loud and scary.

here is a couple crappy screen shots.. It is nice not having modern weaponry. [Cant get some of the picts to upload to imgur for the life of me but this gives ya the gist.](http://imgur.com/a/Ct5mH#0) 










































































 I'm guessing they call them drip tips because the hole is big enough to drip some juice down onto the wick?

well I am perfectly happy to unscrew at time I want to drip a flavor or w/e on top.

What I dont like is juice in the mouth.. and well as tanks empty we tend to tip up. i sometimes put a piece of q-tip in the end.. but that only works for a minute or two before it is saturated and started to make it hard to draw.

anyways all i see are drip tips.. any non drip tips out there? 


















































































































































































































































































 It shouldnt be so instant. Increase the slope by one degree and suddenly you have to walk.. it should gradually slow you down to a walking .. or slower.. speed.

I know some of you have experienced it, where you dont feel like the hill is that steep and suddenly you are walking. It feels wrong, because life doesnt work that way. 







































































































































































































 It calls itself homeopathic but it has measurable natural ingredients. Not a fan of the homeopathic stuff.

 I miss space scifi but it would be really nice to see a good hard science scifi like Rama. you could have an entire season in the solar system. heck you could do an entire show in the solar system, with shows dealing with the politics between the colonies and then have a spin off show where rama leaves.

I see there was talk of a movie, but it doesnt look like there is anything firm.

 It seems to turn their heads for about 10 seconds before they remember they wanted to eat your brains. 









 with all the old school tips, i forgot how i used to love to play back when zeds were harder.. at night(not harder than today, harder than just recently.)

the new patch brought back zeds with a vengeance. It can be tough as hell to even loot anywhere during the day, especially bodies.. outside.. houses with one door and the like. At night it is still scary, they still knock ya down, but agro less besides night is more conducive to horror.
  



















 yeah I know it would either take a crap ton of work on the dayz  commander dude, or cooperation by every single mod crew to provide a common website summary page that dayz commander could easily scrape.

But damn there are a lot of mods these days. and even finding out what they are about can be a chore, some have better websites than others.
