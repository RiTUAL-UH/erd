 Easily my favorite song by Tool 




 Heard a rumor that they are in the studio and a new record will be out sometime towards the middlenof next summer 




 You can never be too prepared 




 House of Pies in Houston, Tx? 




 After accidentally pissing on my Xbox and Nes while sleep/drunk/blacked out, a package arrived on my doorstep. It was a brand new Xbox slim 250gb. A few days later another box arrived. It was a Nes still in the original box!! 




 Easily one of the most frustrating things about a relationship 




 I got a lot of weird looks when I busted out laughing in the middle of the laundromat. . 




 I work in at a dueling piano bar and I usually miss everything that happens there. But on this night I got to see two sets of tits. One from a girl who wanted free drinks from me (she didn't get it this isn't r/gonewild ) and the other because some dude convinced her that it was a good idea to show the bartenders her boobs before they take a shot as some sort of "good luck" act. Either both were nice and made my night! 




 Try again 




 Customer's tits, two sets actually 









 That is fantastic!  You did a badass cover! 
























 I rarely remember my dreams but sometimes they are extremely vivid, sometimes not so vivid. I'm curious as to why that is. 




 Architecture: I don't give shit about physics, it's pretty. 




 As an architecture major,  I thank you for making my life easier in the future 




 I hate you for this.. it's not fair! 




 This gif is so full of hate 




 This motherfucker better make it back to the front page to remind op of how much of a douche he is! 




 It was from last night's game, I was yelling too..at the tv though because I had to work afterwards 




 What's clunky? 




 I'm not saying this is physically or feasibly possibly but, it is a great concept. An open source phone with interchangeable parts, like a desktop computer, sounds like a dream. 









 Usually Local has it on 









 Talked about Skyrim and mods she uses along with Half-life and Quake, as well as the first Team Fortress 





























 I think you're quite adorable 




 OMG DESCENT! !! 




 In all actuality, most bars have these because the local bail offices will give them copious amounts for free. This is also true for matches. The bar I work at get's roughly 10k wristbands, in all sorts of colors, for free rather than the 32ish dollars it costs for a box of 1k wristbands. 




 Hey Anthony,  what would be your dream cast of members for the next band you create?  




 Futurama? 




 A testicle wrapped in a golf ball skin.

Probably a "soft feel" type golf ball rather than a "distance" type. 




 Upvoted but, GC Animal Crossing would win that contest 




 Goog guy cop pulls over slow driver so that fast lane people can drive fast 




 You can't blame him for being hopeful.  




 That mofo is so slow! Super difficult haha 




 Maybe I will! 





























 Thank you. Seriously, thank you. Tonight will be hell.  




 Bullshit 














 Worst band ever. Rivals Nickelback 




 "Forgot" 




 It lacks the length the be effective!  




 OP kept making the omelette 




 Don't blame it on the sink! Blame it on the faucet.. 




 Definitely needed a nsfw mark with a gore portion 




 He looks like the asian kid from Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom 




 The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove by Christpher Moore. That book is hillarious 




 Thanks buddy, feels good.
