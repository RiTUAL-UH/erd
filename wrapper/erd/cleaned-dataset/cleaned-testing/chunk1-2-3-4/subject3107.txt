 Wow... That was uncalled for. 




 How do we escape? 




 Lock your door like everyone says and hope he isn't in there with you. Definitely call the police AND let someone close to you know what's going on, a friend or a parent, etc. The likelihood is that this is someone you know what messing with you, hence the Lulu. But it would be stupid to take any chances.

tl;dr hide and call the fucking police asap 




 Am I missing something? Yes, relatives can be strange but what are you trying to convey. 




 Straight up man you need to call a priest or an exorcist or a ghidt hunter something along those lines. If your parents don't believe you there are two options: 1) Explain the whole ordeal to your parents WITH your siblings and say all you want is to call a priest etc to ease the nervousness. 2) do olit behind their backs when they aren't home or something.

Either way you have to do it.
Good luck OP. 




 Definitely anything by Christopher. Nympho is especially good.

Also, can someone make this playlist on a different service like 8tracks as Spotify isn't available in every country? :) 




 Sorry, everybody I no longer have anymore Aviate invites. However, I will keep this post up in hopes that some others will have a spares. I'm really sorry to anyone who I didn't get to! x 




 shoot me a pm with your email, or comment on my post about invites and i'd love to! 




 I just got Aviate and I have 5 invites for anyone who wants them. Just shoot me a PM or comment your email! All I ask is you return the favor for any other redditors who need it. Maybe we could start a bit of a chain? 

P.S. Aviate is great, I highly recommend it! If you're sort of on the fence about getting it or not, I suggest trying it out for a few days, it really helps to have everything laid out as simply as it is. Good luck new Aviators! 
























 Yes. That was surprising but in an amazingly good way. 




 Toronto FC is actually doing extremely well this season... 




 As a Netherlands fan who is not Dutch, I cannot imagine what they are going through. As for me, six contractors have approached me requesting to use the bricks I have shat to build a new apartment complex. Stay strong Oranje! 




 I think the Dutch will finally get that star :) 




 I worry people will lose respect for Julio Cesar who is a fantastic goalie and really has been Toronto FC's saving grace this season. 




 Thanks for the advice, I'll have a look :) 




 Try C and Am :) 




 It helps to just look up the guitar chords and play around with those. Most of the time you only need to make minor changes to make it sound good on a uke. Good luck! 




 Alright that makes sense. Good luck :) 
























 Hey! I reckon myself a pretty decent pop singer, and I'd love to collaborate with you sometime!

 That is part of our research but our project requires we get opinions from different cultures and peers regardless of their knowledge,  we do not necessarily need to consider it a reliable source, we just need to show evidence of a spectrum of opinions. 




 What is your perspective on whether or not the U.S Foreign Aid towards the Syrian refugees has been sufficient? (Opinions on Obama and Syrian Refugees) 

For a school project (iGCSE GP), I need to get a range of opinions.-so I thought Reddit would be a good place to come to. What are your opinions on how The US and/or other countries have handled the issue and Syria and how they have/should have dealt with the issue of refugees? Also feel free to add any information on the topic too. If you don't mind, I would appreciate of you stated your culture/home country since I need to show I have opinions from a variety of backgrounds. Thank you so much :)

 Im 80% sure I'm gonna be watching the world cup next year! :) 




 You should've deleted everything dude. And boy am I glad I didn't comment on the last two posts. Call the police is all I have to say. Good luck OP. 




 UPDATE:

OK guys. I checked out La Senza today and they didn't sell anything above D but a 32D seemed like a good fit. I'm guessing 32E will be perfect so thank you to anyone who suggested I try that size instead! :) 
























 There's nothing to do but go all out now.  Upload the audio files, dig deeper,  because you're fucked anyway. 




 **Defying Gravity** because when I hit the notes I feel like a princess and when I don't it's still a hell of a lot of fun. 

**Chandelier** channels my inner shower goddess. 

**La Vie en Rose** because it's absolutely gorgeous. 

**I Won't Say I'm in Love** because it's my favourite Disney song. 

**Bang Bang** and **Drunk in Love** because there's so much room to mess around. 




 Sidney Crosby - 9508

Thanks ! 




 No problem dude, stay safe! 




 It might not be smart to keep the file and its contents in your home.  As the investigation progresses they will almost certainly search your property. You're going to have to find a secure place to hide it. 




 I would absolutely love to collab with you, female vocalist btw. I rather sing over tracks with lyrics already written, but I'm also open to collaborating with lyrics. :) 




 I'll see what I can do :) 




 Do you want us to devise lyrics as well? Or do you have some planned?

Female vocalists here btw
 




 I may not sound exactly like Taylor Swift, but you can try me?
