 I was raised with very limited cooking and food health knowledge and I think this might be a good forum for myself and others. Examples of food facts can be anything food related that you think people might not know, such as: spinach has more protein per pound than steak, or to keep your egg yolk from overcooking when making over-easy eggs poke a small hole in the egg yolk once you have the egg off the pan and on your plate.

 At the end of ME3 you have a chance to meld with Liara's mind in this sexy galaxy scene where she hugs your arm. I am now replaying a new career, and when speaking with Liara I find out that their species mates with any other species of any sex by exploring their mate's minds and their genetic material. Could Shepard's genetic material live on in Liara? Does anyone remember if Liara survives in the end?  









 Mine is the M-11 Wraith shotgun. Small clip size, but very powerful, accurate, lightweight, and very quick to reload.  









 Were you even playing the game? I've almost finished, making mostly a renegade campaign, and I am deeply affected by the choices I've made. I lied to the Wrex about the Genophage, wiped out the entire Quarian fleet and watched the wreckage burn like fireworks in the sky of their homeworld, mercy-killed an Ardat-Yakshi, watched Tali kill herself....all because of choices I have made (or didn't make). I would say in comparison to ME1 and 2, the choices are much deeper in ME3, more emotionally connected. I really like playing the renegade campaign, and found it pretty easy to play along in ME1 and 2, but in 3, I really can feel the emotional impact of my choices. I can't be the only one who finds this a masterpiece of space opera. 

[EDIT] I'm going to get drunk and finish the game tonight so I'll post later and tell you guys my final assessment..but so far its been pretty fun. So far I've gotten my moneys worth.

 Three things concerning Halo and it's sequels (anyone else feel this way?) 

1. When I'm over at a friends house and the only multiplayer game they own is Halo, I instantly lose some respect for that friend.

2. When I am forced in a situation where I must play one or two minutes of Halo, it feels as if I am defying one of my base morals, and I lose a little respect for myself.

3. WTF? Another Halo? Doesn't anyone realize how much Halo sucks, and how awful it is compared to this generation's FPS (single and multiplayer) greats? 

In conclusion, HALO SUCKS BALLSAKS.

 Personally I feel like some of the things posted to /r/gaming that are labeled "No Spoiler" are in fact spoilers. They are not spoilers because they give away story, they are spoilers because they give away crucial gameplay elements that would have been fun to discover on my own. Now, if it was a movie, any talk about the movie before you have seen it is a spoiler because a movie is a linear thing, it goes from point A to point B and if you give up something in between that line it's a spoiler. A video game on the other hand, or any video game worth its salt, is a non-linear dynamic media that somebody interacts with. I get pleasure out of discovering things about a game, about the little nuances and side-routes. I make it a point to never read a walkthrough guide until after I have beaten the game by my own wits. For example, I saw a "Last of Us" post about how it is a survival horror game with no scare jumps. Well great, that takes away some of the suspense I might be feeling when I finally play it. Or, on a post I have made a while back I labeled as a "Minor Spoiler" because I told people the best way to kill a Cazador in New Vegas. But people complained, said that it wasn't a spoiler. But to me, it definitely was because when I found out how to do that on my own a whole new world of gameplay elements opened up to me in New Vegas. So...I leave it to you...should we modify the spoiler policy or am I just bitching to the wind?

TL;DR I think that certain things labeled "No Spoiler" are in fact spoilers because they give away gameplay elements.

 Explain to her that the majority of matter and energy in the universe has a tendency to slow down, and that she matters because she lives in a time and place of active complexity, that the life she is living is not a slowing down but a speeding up---technology, sciences, space exploration, human awareness---its all becoming more and more complex,  adding on to each other in a beautiful way, going in the opposite direction of 99.99% of everything else that exists.

 Someone here obviously cannot read between parentheses.  




 I say keep on hating. Hate is an acceptable, natural response to something that is terrible for humanity. And the fact that we let fat people live on without shame to keep on making more fat, bratty kids is absolutely terrible for humanity. 




 Juat rain. I swear we are raising a nation of wimps. 




 They are 8 and 4 and have seen that movie too many times. I kinda want to mildly scare them... but not too much. You get me, fellow dads?

 Yes, perhaps this is a vain attempt. Maybe we could appeal to them to use  this as a forum for their own "confession." I would expect the use of throwaway accounts. One can only hope. 









 Its funny how women feel attractive in high heels yet they utterly destroy the feet. As a man I find it very unattractive when a woman is constantly in heels.

 You would hate the original  




 My girlfriend has this same problem and wonders why she can't make friends. I've never been able to establish a concrete reason why people don't like her, she is a very nice and attractive person. I also have the same problem with making friends. So...our solution is just fucking our brains out and giving the middle finger to the world. Fuck it all and have sex. Forced friends will invariably let you down in some way, and in a way you almost set yourself up for failure, I think, by scrutinizing things too closely. Another suggestion from me would be to put yourself in a place you would not normally be, get out of your comfort zone. Good luck!   




 Yay another app that reads my texts. And thats actually part of the appeal? Fuck this app. 




 It's as shame her feet are wrecked by high -heels. 




 Way to give out your checking account info to random strangers, dumbass. This guy deserves to have his identity stolen. 




 I do not reserve sympathy for people who get their shit blown away in modern American wars.

 Well said 




 we have joint legal custody 




 i was pointing out the hypocrisy here 




 Can we all agree that the term "real man" means jack shit? 




 true 




 we fucked when we were horny teens, then forced into marriage when the pregnancy happened. By forced I mean what the hell else do we know when we are 19? 




 read up 




 horny teenagers dont know what crazy is, because they are crazy 




 Nah, my ex just love to pose "hypotheticals" to me to start arguments.  




 fuck 




 So I mentioned the HPV vaccine to her, strangely, she is on board with that but tries to fight me on the flu shot (i work in a hospital,  my kids definitely get the shot). I think she gets most of her info from "blog mom" websites 




 This is partially true. My ex is so fundie now she won't have sex with another person until she is married again. She brags about this to me, when I mention that she seems lonely because she just loves to waste time texting and calling me, she tells me that all men are losers not worthy of her blah blah blah, in the meantime my kids get to witness what a wonderful example she is. 




 Yeah to too late for that.  But honestly I had no idea she was capable of these levels of fundie when we were married 




 Lol. It's a subreddit... not an admission of anything! If you judge people on their post history on reddit, I can't imagine how you deal with people IRL. Sorry you feel this way!  




 I like feet, big deal. Also: get a life!  




 They have girl programs

 It's an imperfect system. It's the media that does the initial damage... do we really need to see their mug shots until they are sentenced?  




 They are not murderers until convicted. I know you really want everything summed up in a song and dance and then change the channel, but we can't do that in an ordered society.  




 We also don't need people jumping to conclusions before all the facts are heard.  




 She is not subjectively fat. Her BMI I'm sure is in the "obese" range. You are too emotional.  




 I mean fat...do you mean fat? 




 You can tell she was already ruining her feet even at this young age with high heels and small shoes. That big toe angle... dead giveaway and kind of a turn off. 




 Holy heck she got...uh....you know. 




 She is good-looking now,  but I can't help but get this sinking feeling she is not going to age well.  









 If only they were paper we would have 500 wishes.  




 Gross feet 





























 You sir, are a racist.  




 So is it a hard "no" then? Is everything so black-and-white? If they are how I propose, wouldn't it be in their best interest to keep up appearances? 




 The fact that your thoughts come from 10-second searches which are invariably biased has eliminated my desire to have further discussion with you.  




 Does it not deserve some thought? 




 If they are a cult then perhaps we are not fully aware of their inner workings. Does anybody get what I'm saying here? Maybe they have taken it upon themselves to be hated so everyone else can love each other. Just another thought.  




 Personally I feel they are a pro-lgbt and pro-human rights group in "disguise." They announce ahead of time where they are going to protest. Almost every time they are mentioned in the news it is also mentioned that the community came together to form a human wall or something to stop them. And they just stand out there smiling holding their signs, then pack up and leave without hurting anybody. I feel their message is in fact not "God Hates Fags" or anything along that line. I think their message is more about the community coming together in harmony and they have found a way to do it consistently. Just a thought.  














 Yes that's my second favorite. Its almost like a sequel to AtD even though it was written first.
