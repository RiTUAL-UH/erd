 Thank you for doing this AMA. You might like this little Christmas story.

About 10 years ago about this time of year, I was visiting my mother in New York City. In December, tree vendors drive to the city from New England and other places, each with a truck full of trees, and set up shop at curbsides all over the city, selling their trees till they run out. 

My mother has a small apartment and doesn't normally get a tree. One day I was walking past a tree seller and saw that he had taken some little branches about a foot or so long that had fallen from the larger trees, stuck each one into a piece of wood for a base, and put them next to a sign that said "Charlie Brown trees, $3." Naturally I couldn't resist, so I bought one and took it home, and my mother loved it. It stayed healthy-looking through the holidays. 

So thanks to you and your husband for this and other additions to our culture.

 a.k.a. canola oil. It's OK for massages. 




 The main difference is cost and the feeling you got a task-specific tool. Coconut oil is as good as anything with "massage" on the label. 




 Other good massage oils, besides coconut, are sweet almond oil and (my favorite) grapeseed oil. The expensive massage oils at the store are just something mundane like almond oil with some blend of scents; it's easy to duplicate at home for a fraction of the cost.

 The sideways emoticon is the best part. 
























 I read in a book once about an idea for a machine that could take your brain out of your body and fit both it and your body with transceivers so you'd keep functioning as your brain communicated with your body. 

So your body is outside the glass container holding your brain, and you think, "Here I am looking at my brain. Wow." Then you realize, "Wait, shouldn't I be thinking 'Here I am with my body looking at me'?"

I think the book was by Raymond Smullyan.

 I agree with the commenter above. Owning a plane means you don't spend hours in departure lounges every time you travel for business, or have to take an inefficient route through a commercial hub.

 The problem that this county wants to address isn't "some people are homeless," it's "some people are bad."

Many people in power view prison as a tool for moral transformation -- be righteous or be punished. This is part and parcel of that worldview.

 This particular plan may or may not work, but administrative bloat is one of academia's biggest problems, and it's rare to see it actually get addressed. 




 I lived a couple of blocks north of there for two years, and the distance was rarely a problem. Of course most of my classes were in the northwest corner of campus, so I didn't have far to go anyway.

If you can walk to 29th and Lamar, the 338 bus goes to the HEB at Hancock Center. (It may be shorter to walk to 24th and Lamar from where you'll be.) Also the 21 bus goes from the campus area to the Fiesta Mart at 38th and I-35, which is also a short walk under the highway from that same HEB. And Wheatsville Co-op is on Guad at 31st; it's a bit pricey on most items, but you can get some basics there without spending too much.

EDIT: Also, The 338, the 3, and the 22 (the same as the 21 only going the other way) also go to or near Central Market on North Lamar, which is basically an upscale HEB.

 Fred Phelps the head of the clan was a respected civil-rights lawyer before the nuttiness began.

 The bandwagon effect [is real](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6146/647.abstract). Saying you're not subject to it is the same as saying you're a freak of nature, like those people who claim that *they* can text and talk on the cellphone while driving and be perfectly safe. Nope.

 A little no-name sixplex near the north end of the Red River shuttle route. It's nothing special, and all the units are occupied ATM.

 You're gonna need roommates. I'm 2 miles from campus in a tiny $500 studio; even other places in my neighborhood are going for a lot more.

Your best bet may be to use one of the apartment locator places you see on the outskirts of campus; you tell them what you want to pay, they'll show you some in that range. That's how I found this one.

 In general, if the original increase was keeping pace with inflation, then it wasn't a *real* increase, only a *nominal* one -- it looked like it was going up, but it was only because the counting system in use was being degraded by inflation. It's confusing the measuring stick (dollars) with the thing it represents (purchasing power).

(This is not a comment on the policy in the OP, just on how these discussions often go in general.) 




 So it's a reduction relative to inflation, which does count.

 Pornography is objectifying -- we don't see the participants as fully realized people. If there's a story involving the participants, it's basically just a frame to get their bodies together. Erotica engages more of our brain, shows us the characters as people with a full set of desires.

It's not a clear dividing line; some porn does some humanizing, for instance. It's a spectrum.

 It depends. For instance, my hometown had its sewage treatment plant in the south part of town, and it stank to high heaven because nobody cared enough about odor abatement. When they switched to district representation, and the city commission had a rep from that part of town for the first time, it got cleaned up fairly quickly.

District representation makes some things better and some things worse. We'll have to see how the balance shakes out here.

 Hi folks. I'm a grad student working on a project that involves downloading posts and comments from a couple of Reddit subs, and I'm a complete noob at Python and so on. I'm trying to self-teach, but it's slow going, and I need a boost.

So if anyone in Austin can meet me and show me how to do the stuff I need to do (or explain that it can't be done, though I'm confident it can) in PRAW and how to manage the output so it's in a form I can use, I'd be happy to pay for a lesson or two.

(My project isn't "about" scraping Reddit data, my adviser doesn't care how I get the stuff off the site, so this isn't a "do my homework for me" request.)

Thanks! 




 You left out "There are those who will say that" before that quote; the author is arguing *against* the sentiment you attribute to her. 




 I made my GF watch this one, because she had lost my car.

Kind of a long story, but I went out of town for a couple of weeks, and her car needed repairs so she used mine while it was in the shop, and when her car was ready she drove my car downtown to pick it up, intending to come back on the bus later to get my car, only she just plumb forgot, and didn't remember till days later. By that time it had been towed from the 2-hour lot, of course. She was appropriately apologetic and paid the fines, so no harm done. 

In fact she enjoyed the movie, unexpectedly considering what a guy flick it is, and so did I. Though our fun was probably enhanced by the absurdity of the previous events. 




 I only went to that movie because they had a free showing as part of a radio promotion, but I liked it anyway. 




 The critics basically all have to see it, but the audiences are self-selected; they only go to a movie if they're confident it's their kind of thing. So more than half of moviegoers in general might think it's a bad movie, but they won't rate it online because they went to something else instead.

 You should read more closely. Leaving early would have cost *more*, presumably because of the penalty for changing the flight. In that situation, the way you cut your losses is you try to make something of it. Which he did. And things didn't improve. 




 "You just made my whole day." 




 You have no idea what attitude he went into SXSW with. It didn't help that the festival made it harder to preview the bands before showing up this year, but if he thought it was going to suck he'd have stayed home. He's that kind of guy. 




 He's written about the process in past years and has gotten a lot more out of it. 10 days working full time (because this is his job) should be plenty to find the interesting bands, and this year everyone was from LA instead all over. Now that the festival depends so heavily on corporate sponsors, they bring in more bands the corporations already like and fewer unknowns. It doesn't matter if ~2200 bands are in town if they're all the same thing. 




 I think it's important to have it during spring break, so the students who want to attend or volunteer can do so, and the ones who want to get out of town and avoid the madness can do that. But you're right that it's gotten too big and out of control (and money-hungry).

 You know what they say: If you run into an asshole, he's an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole. 




 Most of the bands here for the music portion only get to play one official set, but they're here to get noticed, so there's a secondary economy of bands playing gigs all over town at unofficial venues, including a lot that don't have live music otherwise. Just wander around central Austin and you'll hear a lot of them.

Several years ago I lived at the north end of West Campus and just walking up the street in the afternoon I could generally catch four or five bands. 




  My wife and I used to love going there and we always spent money. But the store started to change and going there stopped being fun.

Yeah, this. I moved nearby in 2007 and loved the place, but sometime around 2010 it was noticeably going downhill, and by the last time I was in there last year it was basically all Hello Kitty merchandise. It seemed like a bizarre trajectory. 




 I know all the letters, or at least 26 of them. Are there more? 




 The what now? 




 Toy Joy was already a shell of its former self before it moved. Last time I went in there it had basically turned into a Hello Kitty store; a lot of the cool stuff I went in there for was long gone. 

It may have been inevitable, I don't know what was going on behind the scenes, but it had gradually been losing its mojo for some time. 




 You missed the part that most of that 2.5 hours isn't part of the calculation. The report doesn't care if you're driving in from Georgetown or Amarillo, only the stretches where traffic is consistently slower than it should be -- the roads in Austin metro -- are part of the calculation.  




 Not quite. They only count the congested parts of roads. The congestion index only accounts for the parts of roads between Waco and Austin that are actually slowed down by traffic. In the NYC area (and other big metros) there are longer stretches of slowed-down roads. 

If you're happy with a short but slow commute, then you're happy because you live close to work, not because traffic is light. Because it isn't. 




 Um, because the library doesn't open until 7? 




 As I understand it, Austin wastes more time per mile of road. NYC's commutes cover longer distances. 




 The [methodology section](http://scorecard.inrix.com/scorecard/methodology.asp) says, if I'm reading it right, that they take the road lengths into account -- that is, NYC drivers sit in traffic longer, but that's partly because they drive farther on average. So, say, a theoretical 10-minute drive that takes 30 minutes is more congested than a 20-minute drive that takes 50 minutes, by that measure. Again, if I'm reading it right. 




 Politics, especially in Texas, is a full-contact sport. It ain't the garden club election. 




 That's not money from the university itself. It's money given by employees and their families out of their own pockets. When you donate to a candidate or a party organization you have to say where you work. 









 Such a little devil, that one. 




 Agree about Sprint. I love the unlimited-data plan, but lordy their coverage here sucks. 




 Suddenly everyone was dog tired. 




 Me: "Know what?"

Dad: "No, what?"

It seemed quite clever to my young self. 




 Interesting. There are lots of other factors too, such as that people will walk farther to get to faster transit, e.g. rail. 




 People generally will only walk 1/4 mile to get to a bus stop. Guad to Congress is about a quarter-mile. That means that if someone wants to get somewhere east of Congress, they may decide the added distance is not worth the effort. 

Having the buses on Congress puts them closer to things people actually take the bus to get to. This will speed up traffic going *through* downtown, but trips going *to* downtown are another matter. 




 Not really a neighborhood intersection; it's a five-way with a lot of traffic, and discouraging cyclists from blowing through there is probably a worthwhile exercise. 




 Little Deli is a wonderful place, glad to see it's getting its due.

 Go look up "honorific." 




 Winds tend to take buildings apart from the top down. 




 Only a few degrees allow one to practice medicine, meaning they can diagnose diseases and prescribe medication. M.D., D.O., dentists, podiatrists, and I think optometrists all qualify. A Ph.D. bestows the honorific "doctor," but you can't do medical things. Psychotherapy isn't medical practice, and many therapists have Ph.D.s. But most Ph.D.s don't care to be called "doctor" except in certain professional settings where the credential is socially valuable. 




 Your mom. 




 Orthography and etymology do matter in making distinctions; words that took different paths to the same pronunciation are not automatically the "same word," and definitely not if their spelling differs, as in this case. There's an argument that rake/rake are different words because of their histories as well as meanings, with ho/hoe the difference is much clearer. 




 No opinion on the stuff you've dug up 'cause I know nothing about architecture, but I was at UT for two years before someone pointed out that PCL is also (on purpose) roughly the shape of Texas. 




 Not a snob, but I like the beans at Wheatsville.  




 I read *Prisoner of Trebekistan* by Bob Harris, a 5-day winner, along with a lot of his blogging, and he's just fascinated with everything under the sun in a childlike, omigosh-look-at-this way that's both endearing and inspiring. Ken Jennings seems the same way to me. 




 Different spellings = no credit. IMHO anyway. 




 Reminds me of a too-high-atop-the-pizza-parlor story. This is secondhand, but I have no reason to doubt it. When I was an assistant manager at a Pizza Hut, back when they all had those peaked red roofs, the story went around of a manager of one of the busiest PHs in the city who had decided that the attic space under the roof was the perfect place to go smoke weed after he got off work. It was summer, so it was pretty hot up there, and he stripped to his underwear. 

Now, there's a reason they always told us never to store things in the attic space: The "floor" isn't designed to hold weight. The manager was walking around up there, when he suddenly crashed through the floor *into the dining area* which was full of people eating. He got up, ran out the door (still in his underwear), and was never heard from again. 




 Interesting, I take almost the opposite approach. I:

* don't use shampoo or soap above the neck, and my skin is nice and smooth and soft as a result.
* don't use shaving soap or cream. I don't even use water. I grab the razor as soon as I'm out of the shower and get to work. (This order is crucial; if I wait even 10 minutes, things get rough.) 
* only shave once; it's all that's needed.

It took a while before my skin got used to dry shaving, and in the meantime I experimented with oil instead of cream or soap; it worked fine, but it gunked up my razor. At some point I just wondered what would happen if I didn't use anything at all, so I tried it and liked it.

Possibly relevant: I use a double-edge safety razor, not one of those multiblade replaceable-head ones. It took a bit of getting used to, but now I wouldn't use anything else. One key is to be gentle and not use much pressure. 




 Shampoo and soap. I stopped using both above the neck a few years ago, and my skin and hair are both in great shape. I do shower every day, including rinsing my hair.

I'm way past my teen years, so I can't speak for the effects on acne. But I wish I'd known to try this back then. 

NOTE: You have to give it at least a week before things will normalize; for a few days your face and scalp will feel oily. It'll get better. 




 That may be, I only saw the thread last week; that person may have been referring to HM. Thanks for the info. 




 I live alone, and there's no way I would fall for this. Not after last year. I know what to expect now.

 The trip to the championships is a big deal for all families, so they pull out the stops for the trip. The flashy cars are probably the most visible thing the visitors are doing besides going to the track meet itself, so that's what most people notice.  




 At that point he was a celebrity, not a regular guy, and wasn't competing like one. 




 I read an interview with a performer who nailed an improv audition by saying to himself over and over "They like me, they like me, they like me." 




 Sometimes that's the only way you can squeeze into the space between the idiot SUVs. 




  have a conversation late at night

So that's what the kids are calling it these days. 




 This was my thought too, but the "lighthouse" answer is better.

 Not mine, but:

Transported to a surreal landscape, a young girl kills the first woman she meets and then teams up with three complete strangers to kill again.

 Absolutely. 

A friend of mine once was job-hunting (she works in tech) and suggested to prospective employers that she work 4x10 instead of 5x8, if the job allowed it, and from their reactions she concluded that they were unofficially expecting her to work 5x10. 




 This is why it's better to tell the truth; it's hard to keep the lies straight. 




 Sam: About a week ago I accidentally slept with a prostitute.

Toby: Really?

Sam: Yes.

Toby: You accidentally slept with a prostitute.

Sam: Call girl.

Toby: Accidentally.

Sam: Yes.

Toby: I don't understand. Did you trip over something?  




 My best friend is an ex-GF. So is my second-best friend, come to think of it. No residual romance in either case, but we care about each other and are in touch pretty much every day.

I have some opposite-sex friends I find attractive who are not romantically available because of distance or being married or whatnot, but the attraction just adds a little glow to our interactions. I don't feel as if I'm missing out, because I like just having these people in my life. 




 I was going to try to think of a good one, but I can't top this. 




 Respectfully but unambiguously.

You may want to ask the other person to work with you on making the relationship healthy again. If they won't do that, or if it's already been tried without success or is otherwise not an option, then do what you need to do.

 Well, back to the word mines.

 I read an interview with William Shatner where he said he hammed up his acting in part to draw attention away from the cardboard sets. 




 Some of the handheld instruments in sickbay were actually salt and pepper shakers. 




 I had the same thought. I've been hitting the gym, but I doubt I could do that.

 The idea implicit in the question "Why is there something instead of nothing?" that there *could* "be" "nothing." That if you took away everything that exists, including the interstellar space and so on, that there wouldn't even be an empty anything there, because there wouldn't be a "there" at all. 

Related: The instant before the Big Bang, when the universe hasn't started expanding yet ... it's not expanding *into* anything, it's spreading the *fact* of existence. 




 And then there's the things that aren't letters *or* numbers ... I was once in a study group and one student whose field is game theory was working out equations on a whiteboard, and most of it just looked like squiggles (and I've had a year of calculus). 




 The logic is that instead of paying taxes overseas they'll pay taxes here. They may actually end up paying less in total, but it won't go to the Bahamas or wherever they have their shelter set up.

 Sometimes one likes to refer to oneself in the third person for no particular reason. 




 Getting back to you: This helped. I got together with a Python whiz, and we used a good portion of the code in that script. Thanks again! 




 A friend of mine was stuck in a closet for hours once; IIRC the closet doors were the louvered folding kind, and she let them close behind her, but they were flush with the bottom and top of the doorway, so she couldn't get a grip on them to open them again (they folded into the closet IIRC). She had to wait till her SO got home from work and wandered within earshot.

 At that age you learn physics and spatial relationships and the vagaries of balance by trial and error.

 That may be the "right" thing to do, but we should harbor no illusions that anyone at the church will be swayed. [WBC is a Primitive Baptist Calvinist church](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-kraus/westboro-baptist-church-rebecca-barrett-fox_b_4997296.html); its doctrine teaches that all people outside the church, and possibly some within it, are damned to eternal hellfire. Messages of kindness and love will sound to them like Charlie Brown's teacher -- Wa-wa-WA wa-wa wa-wa-WA.

I'm not saying we shouldn't take the high road; I'm saying that if we do, it's for our benefit and the benefit of others outside WBC. We just shouldn't fool ourselves about having an effect on the Phelpses themselves.
