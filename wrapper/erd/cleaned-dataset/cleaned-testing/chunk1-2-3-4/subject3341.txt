EDIT: Never mind I see it now....
 




 Well that escalated quickly. 




 I think this has more to do with your tastes maturing rather than just the fact of more exposure. If I hate something I hate it no matter how much I'm exposed to it; only if my tastes and attitudes change will my opinions change.  




 No. Just no.

 Pikachu main, here. I use the c-stick for quick down smashes (roll + down smash is king). Whenever I want to charge a smash I use direction + A.

I'd say it's more personal preference than anything, I know some great players who don't use the c-stick at all. I have found, though, that all the insane players I know ALL use the c-stick. So it would seem that it is your friends that are the noobs and you that are the pro. 

C-stick is also invaluable for directional air attacks. Pikachu's are amazing, so I use the c-stick A LOT for that.

 Why girls need to lie about this stuff is beyond me.

 You come across a child drowning in a river.
Would you rather save the child's life and have no one know what you did, or fail to save to save his/her life (even if you could) and be forever known as the hero who tried? 




 In Asian countries they have a plastic bin right next to the trash meant for liquids. Why they don't have that here is beyond me.

 Not on campus, but pretty sure I might have seen it off campus near Shadyside or up Craig Street. Lots of buildings that look similar close to CMU.  




 You are NOT overqualified for anything. Get your ass out there and work!

 haha sorry, I actually am almost out. I know quite a few people who have more than a hundred dollars left though :) 




 This design was submitted.
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29374/Sample.png
Who could possibly say that the design that was chosen is better than this one? The quality of the submissions was not the problem here. 




 Not very good, the teacher is pretty bad and doesn't teach econ very well. Fortunately, I took AP Micro in high school, so I was able to do well. 
It's not a particularly hard class, so if you're able to get through her B.S. teaching you'll be able to get an A.  




 I can't believe CMU ended up with this design. With our amazing design and arts school, I never expected this would happen. 
The petition that was created the first day of voting did nothing, and the creator of the petition was told to take it down because it might offend the creators of the design. I highly doubt anything we do at this point would be able to change anything.  




 it's bytes, like I said CMU's internet is INSANE. 
and Donner looks super ugly from the outside but it's pretty nice inside.  




 I live in Donner, which is really nice, coed by wing (west and east), largest rooms for a double, walls are pretty thick here. Apparently Stever is considered one of the worst freshman dorms so if you liked it you should be fine anywhere. Morewood has the smallest rooms though, almost tiny compared to mine. 

The internet here is AMAZING, I get ~13 mbps download speed on WIFI which in my opinion is incredible. Yes, sometimes it cuts out randomly for like half a minute but it's infrequent enough that it's not a nuisance. Ethernet is the most stable, never ever had it cut out but I get slower download speeds ~10 mbps. You have a 50 Gb download limit for 5 days but you will never EVER go over it, I download large files constantly and have no problem (I once redownloaded my entire steam library and was fine). There are gaming clubs, not sure if for CS:GO but I'm sure you could form one easily.  




 Red 9. You won't be eating very much here, even though there's no buffets except Shatz they give you a lot of food. I'm a dude that normally eats a lot and these blocks fill me up to the point where I only need to eat two meals a day and a few snacks I can buy at entropy. Red 9 gives you $720 DineX which is more than you should ever need (most people don't use it all, and I actually have to make an effort to spend all of it by the semester).

 Yeah my garage has been duplicating my cars too... weird.  




 From what I've heard the Surface 2 is only a few hundredths of an inch thinner than the Surface RT, so thinness isn't really that big of a difference. Apparently the weight difference is quite nice, though I haven't had any problems with the weight of my RT. I got my 64 GB RT for $200 and I feel no incentive to upgrade to the 2 except for the better screen. I think $250-$200 is the perfect price point for the Surface RT 




 I have the AMD Radeon HD 6630M and I can run at at 40-50 fps. Just run it and play around with the settings a bit.  




 Surface RT runs on flash memory, not a hard drive, so the slowdown shouldn't be from there. Did you run Windows Update multiple times? The updates fix a lot of the lag/slowness issues.  




 Those floors are only accessible by CS students. If you have a friend in the CS department, just have them open the door for you. The elevators work the same way too. 

Or you could get lucky and "conveniently" walk in after someone opens the door.

 I can do Half Life 2.  




 In order of interest: 

* Chivalry: Medieval Warfare
* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
* Max Payne Bundle
* F.E.A.R. 3

Willing to trade any or all my keys for any of these games 1:1. Or counteroffers I'm not particularly picky.  




 I have three copies of Killing Floor as Steam Gifts, includes the game and Defence Alliance 2. Looking for any offers.  




 Just give IE a try. I was skeptical at first too but it really is a great touch experience in tablet mode.  




 Realistically, what do you use NFC for? And why is it so important that if it doesn't have it it's a deal breaker?

Not bashing, just curious. I think NFC is a great tool but I haven't found any practical applications of it that would make it a deciding factor in purchasing a tablet or phone.  




 MathXL puts the CORRECT answer in the box after you get it wrong, so the answer in the blue box is NOT what you input. If you mouse over the box a window will pop up saying "Your answer: _______." I'm sorry but I'm 100% certain you input the y = which is technically an incorrect answer.  




 Well the y = is already given... so technically you DID input the wrong answer. 

I know, I hate MathXL as much as anyone else, but you just gotta learn how to deal with the annoyances.  




 Bought one of these and it did come in original packaging. It arrived packaged and presented as if I had bought it direct from Microsoft.

 Thank you! Did they really give you a dining table and a couch?? 




 Yup, I know that. I wouldn't expect them to give that to us. 




 What appliances are included in the Fairfax kitchens? Fullsize fridge, oven, stove, microwave, sink? There's no information on the housing page.

 Stark didn't say it was vibration proof, he said it *absorbed* all vibrations, meaning the shield can still vibrate but none of that energy is transferred to the wearer. Big difference.  




 I see. In which case decide whether a college degree is really worth it to you. If you foresee yourself getting a better job/being happier once you get a degree then go for it. I don't want you to be like "well what do I do now?" after you graduate.  




 You should go only because of the fact that it's a unique and rewarding experience. College is a unique experience because everyone there is living together and striving to achieve the same objective - the only other place like that is the military. The lessons, skills, and friends that you have there makes it well worth your time.  




 There was an incident that happened during Orientation Week at my school... it is now known as the "Brown Leg Incident."

During the first night of school a guy invited a girl to his room, and they began to get down and dirty. His roommate was trying to sleep on the top bunk and got so fed up that he left to sleep in the lounge. One of the RA's walked by and asked him what was going on, and together they went to investigate the room. 

While the two lovebirds were alone they had switched to anal sex, and were going at it full force when his roommate opened the door. The shock from the door opening and the ongoing sex caused her to unleash her bowels in full force all over the guy's leg, and due to crappy school food it was runny and full-on disgusting. We all ran out of our rooms from the sound and saw the couple covered in shit and fully embarrassed. 

Both students switched dorms after that.  




 On the thumbnail it looks like his nose is made of a dirt block.

 Just because someone uses those services doesn't mean they don't like face-to-face conversations.

 Pikachu doesn't even know what's coming... 




 DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAAAAAAY 




 stoopid hooman...

 Typical rich, preppy white girls with Macbooks and Coach bags. Doesn't even look like it's raining that hard. 
























 "Destitute Tier" haha 




 He doesn't really do a lot of fast action stuff except for the small amount of fighting at the end (that he doesn't do very well in). I'm sure you can get a clean, smooth picture but I'm most worried about the lag making it impossible to play shooters or faster paced games. Thanks anyways though.  




 My god look at that tiny HUD size. 




 How playable is it? Is there any lag/is it manageable?  




 What is that spectrometer at the top? 




 Oh my god, those visually similar images.... 




 Her facial proportions are a little off and frankly a little off-putting to look at (pic 7). I've seen a lot of Asian women and they don't look like this.

 How do you get Samurize to work? Are you still on XP? 




 You have to install all available updates first before it shows up in the store.  




 Just try not using your laptop for a while and see if you can live without it. Only you can tell whether it will be a viable replacement for you.  




 No. 




 I think it's time to look into the pros and cons of using each product in real life rather than just the pros and cons of the computers themselves. If you're gonna be bringing it to class, the Alienware is going to be WAY too huge. I'd go with the blade. In my experience with college, portability and battery life are just SO incredibly important. If you do get the Alienware I would look into also getting a companion tablet or light netbook for you to bring to class with the money you save. They're both great computers that serve slightly different purposes (powerful all around computer vs. desktop replacement). Make your call while considering your lifestyle (do you plan on sitting in your room or going to the library to do work, lan parties with friends, etc.) and how you plan on using your computer (take it to class or leave it in your room). 

Also, technically it's not their first PC, as they have the Razer Blade Pro that was released a few years ago.  




 Even a $30 is WAY too much to spend on a screen protector. Just get a $5 to $10 one if one at all. I don't have a screen protector on my RT and it's just fine. My type cover protects it while in my bag.    




 Future economist right here.   




 Could be a one? 




 Let's blatantly overgeneralize an entire subset of people, that'll go over well.  




 It's a sorority hand sign. Forget which one in particular. 




 The Blade Pro is an outdated system by now. The new Razer Blade is the one you want to get. Switchblade is an old gimmicky system that most games don't support and is a feature I'd pay to get RID of, not to have. There's a reason they haven't updated the Pro/added Switchblade to the new Razer Blade.  














 I also have a stand-alone mic, not in the Picture. One of those Yeti microphones.  




 I do have Razer Surround, it sounds great.  




 I have it dual-booted to Ubuntu, I just need Windows for gaming.  




 This keyboard is AMAZING, much better than any membrane or chiclet keyboard in my opinion. The only downside is it's VERY loud, really clacky especially if you type fast (of courss, this could be seen as an upside to most people). If you have roommates or if you think you'll be bothered by the sound I'd recommend asking for the Steath version which uses different switches to be quieter. Personally, it doesn't bother me or my roommate and I kinda like the sound it makes. 




 Not sure? It's just a background I found when browsing google images. Link the the wallpaper has been provided on this thread already.  




 Yes, I have a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50s. I am interested in getting a pair of actual gaming headphones, though. The Razer Kraken 7.1 looks really nice at a reasonable price.  




 It's a Cooler Master Notepal U2 Laptop Cooling Pad, found [here](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834997730).  




 Yes, I LOVE this keyboard, I had the 2012 model before and just recently upgraded to this one (2013) with the Cherry MX Blues. It is very noisy, and I do have one roommate. Fortunately, he doesn't seem to mind it unless he's trying to sleep and I'm still up typing something. I guess it just depends on who you have as a roommate.  




 I made the Rainmeter skin myself, I will be posting it on /r/Rainmeter soon. Look for it there! 




 I do use my laptop screen frequently, but I would be interested in getting a stand to slide my keyboard under when I'm not using it. Thanks for the idea! 




 It's a skin I made myself actually. I am thinking of posting it onto /r/Rainmeter soon. Look for it there! 




 I prefer it for sure. It kinda braces your hand and wrist and allows for finer mouse movements. 




 I'm not really sure? It's been a long time since I've had it installed, so I don't really remember.  




 I am studying hard; I go to one of the country's best Computer Science schools. This is just a small hobby of mine, I don't intend to build some insane computer-built-into-desk-with-liquid-cooling-and-leds system. Just some suggestions on computer placement or small changes or some stuff that I haven't thought about would be nice.  




 Yeah, I re-installed windows and didn't install the beats audio drivers after. Honestly, beats doesn't sound all that bad on my laptop; I even think it makes the sound from the built-in speakers sound better. You can disable the equalizer and tweak the bass and stuff so it doesn't sound bad. 

But yes I do have it completely uninstalled and it sounds pretty much the same.  




 It's windows 8 with the programs Rainmeter and Stardock Objectdock. Objectdock gives me that menu on the left and Rainmeter gives me the bar on top and right side and the date and time in the middle. 

I actually have my laptop dual-booted for Ubuntu, which I prefer over Windows 8 for web browsing and stuff like that. When I want to game I switch over to Windows.  




 It uses a lot less bandwidth than Skype does, so in that sense it's better. Whether you like the sound quality is up to personal preference; Razer Comms tries to make your voice stand out above in-game audio but it can make it sound a little harsh and unnatural in my opinion. Just try it out and see what you think! 




 [Here](http://wlppr.com/wallpapers/2010/06/14/Slides_of_light.2880x1800.jpg) you go! 




 I would totally get a different desk if I could, but as this one came with the dorm I would rather stick with it. Plus I wouldn't have a way of keeping the desk for next year. For now, this is what I have.  




 HP Envy 14 Beats Edition. Not exactly the best laptop, it's about 2 years old. Definitely getting a new one soon.  









 Is it just me or does this cat look a little like Wall-E? 




 I see what you did there.  




 This article talks about having the battery *constantly* at 100%. As long as you let the battery go through charge cycles decently regularly (let the battery discharge to maybe 20% at least once a month) you shouldn't have an issue with reduced battery life.  
























 The keyboard the keyboard the keyboard. The keyboard will be a HUGE step up from a simple microsoft membrane. Besides, you already have a headset you like, that upgrade won't be nearly as impressive as the jump to mechanical. 

As for your worries about mechanical keyboards:

* Don't worry about it disturbing you when you play. It won't, besides you use a headset so you'll barely be able to hear it. 
* Don't worry about you not liking it. Unless you are in a VERY small minority, you will absolutely love it and you will wonder how you ever typed without one. 

You can always return it if you REALLY don't like it. Go for the keyboard. You won't regret it.   




 Cash can be used anywhere that currency can purchase goods.  




 What case is that?

 I think THIS is the way to do it, not a 2 minute rejoin window. League of Legends does it this way and it works pretty well in my opinion.

 How do these compare to the Invisible Shields? I got two anyways but I'd like to know.

 Thanks!

 Try completely uninstalling Synapse and seeing if the keyboard functions as usual. If it doesn't, I think it would be time to send an email to Razer Support.

 Can you really play BF4 on the Edge? What graphics settings and what FPS do you get? 




 To get more rows of tiles on the start screen, go to settings  tiles  show more tiles and tick to yes. On my RT I get four rows instead of three.  




 I'd love a few to repair my old beat-up controllers :)

 And this is news because....? 




 EDIT: Holy shit, Gold! Thank you so much kind stranger! I figured that comment would get buried for sure! 




 I totally agree. Intel does offer more performance but bang-for-buck AMD is much better. As a college student on a budget that's what I went with. I have my 6300 OC'd to 4.7 GHz and it performs very well; at this point the only CPU I'd upgrade to is an i7-4770k, which would require a new mobo and quite a bit more money. I'm happy where I am right now.  




 It wouldn't be too much more expensive, and it would allow you to add more things in the future if you would like.  




 Better graphics card comes to mind first, then a power supply with more wattage. That's really about it. 

Keep in mind this is a MICRO build, more for portability than anything. If space isn't an issue, get a larger case and a better mobo.  




 You could go with an R9 280X for $100 more and have a PC that will last you for a long time.  




 I built a killer mid-range gaming pc (plays most games like BF4 maxed) for $800 or so just a few months ago so you should be fine with the cash you have set aside. I've posted pcpartpicker below. 

I got a lot of my parts with good deals which is why the total price is a little high.

 Thanks! 




 I mean sure, why not? It's just putting a custom case on a shelf above your desk.   




 Way to ruin it with the title.  




 Ah man, that sucks. Didn't know that was specific to the first generations.  




 Works for me on my RT + Touch Cover 1. You have to tap pretty fast and hold down the second tap.  




 Double-tap then drag. 




 I looked into it more and found that I do have DDR3 memory running at 1333 MHz. It seems that I was looking at the DRAM frequency.  




 I see, it seems I don't know enough about memory. Thank you for the clarification! 




 How much would you be willing to sell two of your 4GB PC3-10600s? 




 I would like to get at least 2 x 4 GB PC3 10600 or PC3 12800 (1333 or 1600 MHz) ram kits at around $30 or so. Anyone have old laptop memory meeting these requirements? Shoot me an offer!
 




 I think people SEVERELY underestimate the value of the touch covers. Here's why:

* Absolutely NO moving parts/greater durability. This is so much better for travel or general "beater" use as there are fewer things to break or get caught in. 

* Greater spill resistance. Spilling liquids on a Type Cover would require a lot more recovery than with a Touch Cover. Unless you've managed to soak it all the way through, a simple wipe-down with a paper towel is all you need to clean a simple Touch Cover spill. 

* Thinner. I know at this point we're talking millimeters of difference but the Touch Covers (especially Touch Cover 2) just feel so much lighter. 

Unless you do a LOT of typing (I'm talking multi-page essays or university assignments), the Touch Cover will be FAR more useful. A thin lightweight cover for your Surface that's good enough for banging out a few emails or urls when needed. 

To directly answer your concern, you can just tap the trackpad anywhere to register a left click and tap with two fingers to register a right click. No need to ever use those dinky buttons below the trackpad.  




 I have a stock cooler from an FX 6300 never installed. Name your price.  




 I love the Surface as much as anyone in the subreddit but I gotta say that ultrabook looks top notch... I would honestly go with that. The slightly better resolution and screen size does it for me. 

I have a Surface RT but I still prefer the traditional laptop/ultrabook build for a primary portable work computer. Sure I know it's basically the same thing with a type cover but the 10.6 inch screen is a *little* too small for heavy working for my taste.  




 Honestly this ultrabook would have pretty much the exact same portability of a surface.  




 Yes, but there are adapters that you can buy to get an ethernet port. 
 




 I upgraded from the Blackwidow Ultimate 2012 edition to the 2013 edition and that was very much worth it. If you have nothing else I say go for it! 




 Just take a look around, they don't really have THAT many products. Only then will you know if there's some really cool looking headset or mouse that other people don't recommend. 

Having said that, though, I recommend:

* Razer Black Widow Ultimate 2013 Edition Keyboard (BF4 edition if you really want it, but I like the clean Razer green)

* Razer Mamba Mouse. (this is the category where you should REALLY look around yourself, they have TONS of awesome mice.)

* Razer Kraken 7.1 Headset. 

Again, just take a look and see what really suits you.  




 Date and time skin at the center is [Metro Desk X](http://exsess.deviantart.com/art/Metro-Desk-X-v0-8-ALPHA-366743811). Top bar and side bar are custom skins created myself.  









 Try unplugging the keyboard, restarting your computer, and plugging your keyboard back in after your computer has completely booted up again.  




 I don't really see the difference between the two questions? Sure, the second one is more specific but a good reviewer will talk about how the workload impacts social life when asked just the first question (because it's the greatest factor in how social you are). Same for most questions on the page, they sound like generic questions any freshman or college review websites would ask. 




 For comparison here is the same model sold on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/171011545519?ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT _trksid=p3984.m1423.l2649). This is a FANTASTIC monitor well worth the money. Good luck on the sale!
