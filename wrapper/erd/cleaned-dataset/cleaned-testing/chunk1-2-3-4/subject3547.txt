 Your bot could keep some kind of database with entries for every user it encounters, and the link to their wiki page. I'm not sure how you would go about creating the wiki page, but your biggest problem would probably be retroactively adding users who posted their first post before the bot became active.

 Major lag issues with this update. Every few minutes everyone on a server will experience massive lag, and input is like skating. I'm waiting for Valve to fix this one. 




 This is my favourite ad on reddit. I don;t use bitcoin, but I click on it every time anyway. 




 I love the contrast between the smooth, fuzzy circles and ripples, and the hard, geometric hand.  




 The shape is perfect, I love the crystal-like look to it. I can't think of anything to change, maybe make the purple part a little bit transparent? Otherwise it's perfect. 




 Very pretty.  




 I like it, but it seems odd that the middle part of the glasses would be made of glass as well. It would make more sense for it to be made of a different material, like a grey metal.

 I was driving home the other afternoon, as the sun went down. The light had begun to get redder, and the air to cool. I was feeling happy and relaxed, and then had a thought. What if sunsets are beautiful because it signifies another day survived? From an evolutionary perspective, we've evolved to feel good after surviving another day, which drives us to keep going. /notabiologist

 I have it built, do you think it would be worth it to set up a server for it? Maybe I should message the subreddit mods and see if they approve of it running 24/7 for this subreddit. 




 lol yah. I'm having rate limitation issues. I need to build the bots karma up for a few days before I launch it fully. 




 D'oh, street view would be from a while ago .

I believe that the reference to Florida was just a story. That story was the one part of it that seemed too forced/fake.  




 Update: All done now, should be working on this subreddit as well

 The banners don't match the ones in the videos, would they have changed them in two weeks? 




 !gameMe someServerThatDoesn'tExist 




 Don't we all need a little ego-boosting from time to time? ;) 
I can't really think of when it would be used either, but it'll be there if people want it.

(Also, I'm almost done now, so too late!) 




 There's a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7VQARbRhYA list=PLIvrgpZKZrKim6ga0LD3PBbopdqRQ3Lhf) of all the videos. It's terrifying, idk what's going on D:
 




 What is that in the [window](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ-u4_sQSNk)!?! 









 I'm trying to play around with reddit's API, and I got a neat idea for a bot. a gameMe/hlstats bot that pulls your stats for a specific server and posts them as a comment. e.x.

test_subject3547: "!gameMe someServerName"
gameMeBot: "Pos: 9001 Points: 0"

You would associate your steam and reddit accounts with the bot by sending it a PM like "associate STEAM_0:XXXXXXXX"

Any interest/suggestions? I would probably make it search through this subreddit, /r/gaming, maybe /r/steam and any other subreddits for games tracked by gameMe.

Edit: I've got a prototype working, just working on customizing which server to pull stats from. 
























 Not a video editor, but I approve of the Tut Tut Child ;) 




 Wow, this is really cool! :D
It's a very original idea, and I love the little details, like the colours changing as you rotate. 




 That's one small wank for man

     volume = 1 
    while True:  
        answer = ask("why")  
        if not answer:  
            volume += 1  
        else:  
            break 




 This is really pretty. 




 Maybe he went upstairs to use the bathroom or something? And then made the innapropriate comment when he saw you watching them.

 try !gameMe (note the capital "M") I can change it to make it non case-sensitive if you'd like. Also you'll need to associate your account first.
