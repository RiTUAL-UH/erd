 I've never really thought about that, but that's very possible. I will try bringing it up to them, hopefully they take me seriously  




 That a good idea, I just want to go see someone I trust. I'm trying to work up the courage to, last night I had a horrible night and I hope she will take me seriously 




 Internet hugs to you too, I'm glad someone's on my side! 




 Thank you for the advice, good luck to you too. I tried talking to the school counselor once after my mom and I had this big fight over nothing (she threatened to leave the family) and that was around the time I started getting overworked about things. She was okay to talk to, but its hard for me to open up to people and I couldn't find the strength to to her. I hope you find help too!  




 Thanks, I will try that!   
























 It does help me but not when my friends think I'm a shitty person for doing it 




 I know, I should, it does relieve anxiety when I have it, but I have anxiety since the people I know just think its a bad thing 




 the method is great - and so easy to use once you get the hang of it!! 




 Yes, before it would get very bunched up and hard to work with, thanks for this tip! 




 This helped SO much. Great visual!!!! 




 Thanks! I'm going to do this!
