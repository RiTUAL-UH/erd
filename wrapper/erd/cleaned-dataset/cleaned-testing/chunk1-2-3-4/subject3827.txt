 The Ricky Gervais Show 




 *Hello,* Nedry 




 I sorta felt that Rise was both Escape and Conquest, while Dawn was more Conquest/Battle - either this will just be Battle, or Battle/Apes 




 I hope they change it to War *on* the Planet of the Apes, I think that sounds better 









 Too bad for you man 




 Seriously, that stuff is incredible 




 Well, thankfully it wasn't Hank Azaria or one of the main family members - I don't think they'd be able to go on without them 




 Huh 




  uses his God powers to send these legitimate practical effects to his son and our savior, Jorge Millir 




 Disney knows what they're doing 




 I Love Lucy 




 It's like poetry, it rhymes.

FTFY 




 Scrambled 




 They're kinda cute, actually. 




 If you could give birth to an animal, what would it be? 




 Okaya I wonta 




 Well, it didn't take me that long to make - I'll try to clean it up a little - add music, make the cuts a little less rough - what else? 




 Empire Strikes Back, Godfather Part II, LotR: Return of the King, The Dark Knight 




 What, the 5 minutes it took me to make? 




 So it's okay to put a written version of this plot leak, but not a visual? 




 Oh shoot! 57 seconds of your precious life down the drain!

Oh, and no one forced you to watch it. 




 Soylent Green... IS PEOPLE! 




 Nah, it's the same thing has having a nose in the middle of your face - it's right there, and it seems like it would be a distraction, but you don't really notice it. 




 Yeah, I can't believe they gave him those 3 Oscars! Ugh, how stupid of those "academy members" to reward good filmmaking! 




 Throw up your hands and raise your voice! 




 The ring came off my pudding can! 




 Well, sorta Jar Jar for giving Palpatine his power  




 Ricky Gervais' stand up is pretty hilarious  




 Yeah, but the question wasn't "which fact do you not believe is true?" 




 That's not only not socially acceptable, but insane. I hope you were joking. 




 That's where, we found... 




 Any way the wind blows, 




 My favorite

 The Man Who Knew Too Much 




 Yup, because the only people who see these billion dollar movies are mouth breathing fanboys.

Sorry 









 Then post it in /r/musicvideos or something. 




 So May 1994?

 Really? I've never heard of this vastly underrated film! 




 Right, but they are 2 completely different mediums. Paintings can use visual storytelling, doesn't mean it's something you discuss in a movie-focused setting. 




 I can't wait till they release a new LEGO Star Wars game with TFA included 




 Why is this being asked in /r/movies? 




 Really? And all the other fake plot rumors and trailer "leaks" aren't? At least I'm reporting on a piece of news that's actually true... 




 Who was making that point? 




 Ugh, I guess I have to:

Le *Interstellar* 




 You can't try a food for the first time and not like it, and then have someone explain why they like it and it changes your opinion.

I totally agree. 




 C'mon, it's not *that* expensive  




 No, it's just the article with the same pics 




 Yuuuuppp 




 Well, everything about this looks more promising than the prequels... 




 No - I just meant I have it digitally - i don't have early access or anything. Besides, im sure it'll be online Monday. 




 In the Apple newsstand store 




 I meant out digitally - it's not like I have exclusive access to it or something... 




 Yeah, it was sorta obvious.

Just tryin' to be a good person. 




 Actually, Empire Strikes Back is the Pig in the City of Star Wars movies 









 Alright, but you're the one who couldn't understand a simple joke. I really couldn't care less. 




 Seriously, I'm confused now. I'd love to help you explain it, but now I'm not even sure what you're referring to. 




 Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan 




 Less than 5 years ago, this was just a dream. And now it's actually happening. I can't believe it.

I hope it doesn't suck! (It won't) 




 I'm glad they're taking the starting-over route, and the ending leaves a lot of possibilities as well.

Thoughts? 









 I was having this debate with a friend the other day, and he said that a movie doesn't need to have a central lesson or message to take away from it to be good.

I disagreed, and I still think it's one of the most important parts of film.

What do you think? What (well-liked) movies don't have this, but are still good? 




 Lord Nolan also appreciates the Kevin James directed psychosomatic-thriller.









ayy lmao 




 Now don't get me wrong. The Dark Knight is not, by any means, a bad movie. It is well acted, well directed, and very well put together. But as a superhero movie, and as a movie in general, it falls down in a few places.

1 We don't get emotionally involved with our characters. In movies like Superman or Spider-Man, our characters show that they are humans, and they have struggles. Superman literally moves the world back in time to save the person he loves. Spider-Man never knows whether he should reveal his true self to his friends and enemies. Batman just says he's the good guy. He doesn't show it, and you probably wouldn't care if he died.

2 Why so much violence? Seriously, why does every car or building need to get shot at or blown up? It should be a battle between the hero and the villain, not the hero and the villain and the rest of the world. It doesn't need to happen, and it shouldn't. Maybe a few times, but it shouldn't detract from the story itself.

TL,DR: - this is NOT a bad movie, but there are much better superhero films

EDIT: or a 94% on RT, the ideas still apply 




 Sometime before or after the release of The Godfather Part III, Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola came up with a potential sequel idea. It would have been a similar style to Part II, switching back and forth from Vito's early days as Don in the 1930s (as well as the early years of his children's lives), and Vincent as the new Don in the 1980s. Vincent takes a turn from his predecessors, and gets the Corleone family involved with narcotics again. It would have ended with his death. 

More info can be found [here](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Corleone), under "abandoned sequel"

Do you think this could've worked? 









 I have a friend who literally cannot watch movies made before the year 2000. 

Some examples:

Thought that Star Wars was "too slow," Back to the Future is "cheesy" and Hitchcock is boring.

I need a 20th century movie that quickly gets into the plot, looks good, has a good pace, and good acting. His favorite movies are The Social Network and Nightcrawler.

I hope someone can help! 




 My reaction after seeing it again:

Good stuff:
- Thoroughly enjoyable
- Not lazily made or incompetently made
- Basically a dino horror movie

Bad stuff:
- Sort of a stereotypical plot
- Kind of the same movie as 1 and 2 
























 I feel like Stanley Kubrick and George Orwell's novels were perfect for each other. Animal Farm and 1984 have similar concepts and themes as A Clockwork Orange, 2001, and Dr. Strangelove.

What do you guys think? 



















 Either unprotected or with a space suit -

How would it be different than on Earth? 




 Best letter ayy lmao amirite???

 




 It's called 2001: A Space Odyssey 




 Mine are:

4) Casino Royale

2) Skyfall

1) Goldfinger 




 If one were to make a re edited version of Return of the Jedi, what would the basic plot look like? What would needed to be changed/taken out? 




 An idea I had for the highest grossing movie of all time:

Director: Christopher Nolan 

Producer: James Cameron

Writers: Joss Whedon +                      
              Quentin Tarantino

Starring: Leonardo Di Caprio, Christian 
               Bale, Jennifer Lawrence, 
               Scarlett Johansson

Music: Hans Zimmer

Cinematography: Emmanuel Lubezki

Visual Effects: Weta Digital


What would you pick? Anything to add or change? 

EDIT: Spielberg as co director, also with Chris Pratt

EDIT 2: The plot is a cross between Interstellar, Inception, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Obviously. 




 I also thought John Wick and CHAPPiE were amaze

Cinnamontography A+++ 




 Mine are:

Star Wars
Jaws
Jurassic Park
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Planet of the Apes
Back to the Future
Rope
Singin in the Rain
All the President's Men
12 Angry Men 









 Ex:

Half Life 3 speed run record, set on May 27th 3476 









 IMO they're all great. 









 I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but which movie was the one where Rocky said "every champion was once a contender who refused to give up?" 




 Like, he wanted to prove to everyone that he could make a movie on his own and it was really just a foreshadowing of what the prequels would bring... 
























 Super Smash Brothers Drift (Kart Racing/Fighting game)

You would be able to play as all the characters from the most recent SSB game, with their own customizable racing karts.

The style of the game would be somewhat different than other racers like Mario Kart - you can choose to compete with 4 - 12 players on a variety of tracks. 

But here's the twist - there's no finish line - you are continually moving around the chosen track. The position of the players is determined by a damage meter/percentage, like that of the real SSB games. You can use a multitude of attacks on other players, including bumping into other karts, and launching projectiles. Items and power ups would be scattered around the track, and whomever has the least damage when the time limit is up wins the game.

This is just an idea I had and I would love to here your opinions. I'm working on some concept art for the game, which I'll post later. 









 On the Club Nintendo website it says that new rewards are coming January 19th. 

2 things:

When today will we be getting new rewards?

What rewards do you think they'll be?

Personally, I have a lot of points to spend, so I'm hoping for some good 3DS downloads... 




 Only 11 months from today!

When do you think we'll see a poster? 









 This is kind of a stupid theory, but I'll share it anyway:

As we all know, Nintendo's first few consoles were the NES, SNES, N64, and the Gamecube. Then, we had the Wii, followed by the Wii U. 

See any similarities yet? Well, it's a bit of a stretch, but both the NES and the Wii were succeeded by consoles that had the same name, with an extra letter added. This could be totally insignificant, but could the next console be the Nintendo 128 (or something along those lines) followed by the Nintendo Videosphere? Only time will tell...


TL;DR - theory about console naming

 Nice try Plankton. 




 A long, long time ago...

There are two directions this one could take 




 Even still, we shouldn't make the assumption that this is actually what goes down in the movie. For all we know, none of it could be true. 




 Yes 




 So a crossover with two movies that involve cars and crazy stunts with lots of action would be crazy? I don't see how that couldn't work other than the time period difference... 




 Was it ever NOT gonna be a good movie? 




 Could someone please link me to the episode or clip where Rich says "mopies" instead of movies? 




 I dunno, I thought this season was a big improvement over the last few. Did you see the finale last week? It was actually pretty good! 




 I gave someone a link to something I found through an easy Google search

 I disagree, at least with them being bad. The visual effects in the prequels were ahead of their time and they hold up pretty well today. 




 What?? 




 So you ask for people's interpretations, but then you say that their arguments are invalid, despite the fact that they are based on logic? 




 My two favorites will always be Bootleg Pokemon and Takeshi's Challenge. On the other hand, I'd have to say that his earliest stuff isn't very good.

 Sure - I'll get right on it 









 I would think they save it for D23 




 That's possible

 Well, he was sorta the key to all of it, he was a funnier character than they've ever had 




 I thought that was also in The Clone Wars from 2003 




 7 months from today, Star Wars The Force Awakens will be released in theaters.

When do you think we'll see another poster or teaser? 




 Haha! Women in a movie! I thought that was so hilarious!

/s 




 Oh it definitely matters how good it is. Would you rather have 1 bad movie about and influential figure or 2 movies, one of which will be excellent? 




 Yeah, but this'll be good. 




 Who cares? I think they're funny and entertaining, it doesn't make a difference to me if they aren't actually legitimate film critics. 




 Exactly! 




 So you've seen every film in existence and know for a fact that he is the only man who's ever slowed down the frame rate of a shot? 




 Source? 




 So? Seriously, what is so revolutionary about that? Did he invent some new technology? Is he the first person to ever do this? 




 So I would be praised for revolutionizing the art of film by putting a couple of slow motion shots in my movie? I know that's simplifying what Miller did by a lot, but the principle still applies. 




 But the ability to express the characters in terms of audio and visuals is unique to filmmaking. It gives you a clearer picture of who someone is and what their motivations are. 




 More so than a movie like Star Wars? Jurassic Park? Even something like Birdman? 




 For you. 




 Seriously dude?? 




 Not really 




 Some guy with a broken leg watches other people out of his window

 Don't generalize all of our food when you see places like McDonalds or KFC - try to find some nice, local restaurants, as a lot of them are very good. 




 I've got an amazing cable access show and I still know how to party! 




 Well, he's still aging every year  




 You mean movies that you've seen this year? 




 What's so special about the frame rate/editing compared to any of the other big budget action movies? 




 Well, no offense, but don't talk about it like its some low-budget spiritual piece of filmmaking. Don't get me wrong, it was great, but there really wasn't *that* much there in terms of story or character development. 




 Exactly - it's not about how it was made, it's about what you see on the screen. If that doesn't stand out in any way, then there's no point. 




 ok I'll be quiet 




 It made 100 million dollars this weekend. Not exactly tanking. 




 Saw **The Bridge on the River Kwai** for the first time. Loved it. 

It almost felt like the precursor to Lawrence of Arabia, such a large-scale story told beautifully.

 Oh my gosh! I was wrong 




 Sorry, got confused 




 I disagree - I really don't think anyone could've done as good of an Alec Guiness impression 




 No, I think it was shot on Arri Alexa digital cameras 




 Honestly I think James Franco could play that role pretty well 




 Seriously, why wouldn't it? It's a big budget Hollywood movie based off an already existing franchise with big names as stars. It had a decently large advertising campaign, and it's been doing incredibly well with critics. 




 I've been starvin' 'em, tazin' 'em, singing off key... 




 Can I play the piano anymore? 




 The movie will also spread through the massive ad campaign. Trust me, you guys are talking about this like its a low budget indie movie based on a completely original idea. 




 Yup 




 Sounds like it could be cool - more of a "Close Encounters" approach 




 For example, I've always wanted to see what Stanley Kubrick could've done with Lord of the Rings, or even 1984.

What movies do you wish a director had made? 




 That is all. 




 On a Thursday? Not really. Wait till the weekend is over. 




 Yeah, but that doesn't really make much sense

 Star Wars Sequel Trilogy - I *need* to know what happens! 




 Yeah, I watched The Godfather this week and it was utterly horrible compared to Kung Fury

Edit: (/uj) I actually forgot I was browsing /r/moviescirclejerk for a moment and I thought this was an actual /r/movies thread (/rj) 




 It's stupid to say something is unfairly judged by critics. That's why they are critics, is because they are qualified to be judging something. If the unanimous decision of the critics is that the movie is bad, then it might be true for a lot of people. 




 Alfred Molina IIRC - Satipo (Indiana Jones), Doc Ock, and some Prince of Persia character  




 Well, that's in terms of box office, not toy, book, and video game sales. 




 I have no idea why you would make a statement that's obviously going to provoke an argument. 




 So we're all neckbeards because we disagree with your opinion, which basically no one else has. 

Logic = A+ 




 I think the conversation was started in the mid-80s, with Gremlins and Temple of Doom. This was tame enough for the time, I guess. 




 Yeah, but not as good as Jaws, unfortunately 




 There was nothing groundbreaking or special about Avatar other than the special effects, which are now commonplace in today's movies. I can't see any Avatar sequels making anywhere near the amount of money that the first one made.

However, Star Wars may be the most popular and successful movie franchise of all time. Like you said, its appeal spans multiple generations all across the globe, and a sequel 10 years in the making is not something that no one cares about. 88 *million* was the number of views that second trailer had in *24 hours*. That's amazing. There is no doubt in my mind that its success will be equal to that of Avatar's. 




 Boring, art house, and foreign all sort of imply pretentious in the context you use it in... 




 http://imgur.com/HfO0EL3

Always loved this scene 




 Guaranteed 1 billion, likely 2, and if it's really really good, I can maybe see it passing Avatar as the highest grossing movie of all time. 




 *The Godfather* - not pretentious or foreign, it is just one of the best written and well told stories.

*Citizen Kane* - most of the cinematography, lighting, makeup, and storytelling techniques you see today? Citizen Kane invented those. 

*The Empire Strikes Back* - nothing pretentious there. Just a good, fun movie. 




 To be honest, there wasn't that much explicitly wrong with it. Sure, the acting was bland and it could be dull at times, but it did its job as a disaster movie. It had the right blend of characters and action. 




 I elaborated on my point. You answered the question saying everyone hates Star Wars when you like it, but that's objectively not true. 




 Well, not really unknown with a few million subs 




 That was Sjin! 




 Think about how much hype that created. No way to see it online easily, and there hadn't been a Star Wars movie in 16 years. 




 No, they're really not. No one hates Star Wars. It's one of the most universally adored and most popular franchises. 




 **The World is Not Enough**

C'mon. It's a cool spy action movie. What's not to love? 




 Well, technically it was produced in Britain with some of their money... So... 




 Eh, more like an SNL sketch, not a feature length movie 




 The Godfather 




 The Elephant Man

Spartacus

The Godfather Part III 




 It was filmed there.

What makes 2001 British? 




 He does use the same quality and techniques for effects 




 I would think that

Kylo Ren = Darth Vader

Snoke = The Emperor

Gleeson's character = Tarkin

Captain Phasma = Boba Fett  




 I would think OP means from the two teasers 




 I think they've confirmed that was pulled from the film - if anyone could back me up on that, that would be great 




 My friends and I played the most intense game of Clue ever. 




 MICHAEL! 




 It just goes to show that, no matter what you say about the quality of those movies, George Lucas new something about marketing 




 - Have seen movie
- Has read book

A few things that make the movie so great in my opinion:

Kubrick's direction

Nicholson's acting

Cinematography

Visuals

Suspense and fear

Though very different from the book, The Shining is a good film on its own 




 Wayne's World. Uh, excellent! 




 Written for the movie... So... 









 I would think "realistic looking computer graphics" fits better 




 Mad Marx: Commie Road

ayy lmao 




 Star Wars, 2001, Jurassic Park, Jaws 




 A few bad names =/= bad story, bad acting, bad directing, or bad visuals. Wait till the movie comes out. He won't ruin it.

 I wouldn't say horrible quality, Apple does make quality designed hardware and software that works for most average people.

 No, but it would be a more gradual decline to insanity, and I think he can do the whole "intimidating but strangely calm" thing 




 I've always wondered how to see google searches from previous years, thanks! 




 That's why I think Harrison Ford could've worked well in that role 




 Me neither - I think it was only with the IMAX 3D version 




 It might be in IMAX theaters as well 




 Always wondered this. I know there were a countless number of times when Lucas said no, but were there ever rumors in the 2000s of another movie happening?  




 Star Wars - Episode 3: Divisions of the [Quagmire](http://imgur.com/YFRz1l3) 




 The Clone Wars seemed like it could be a title for one of them 




 Yeah, there's really not much about those that couldn't be canon 




 I have 3/5, Droids, Clone Wars Volume 1, and the Ewoks movie. Only the Clone Wars, and maybe Droids, are recommended. 




 I wondered if I should put it on, and I almost left it out, but there are some people out there who seem to like it... 




 Personally I love Last Crusade the best.

What do you think? 




 I honestly don't know how I feel. There were as many good moments for me as there were bad. Firstly, I loved the style overall. It had a very Disney-ish feel to it, which helped to bring a sense of wonder and adventure to it. On the other hand, it was probably one of the most cliche movies I've ever seen, and the dialogue was not anything to be proud of. 




  That's another small step for man, an even greater leap for mankind 




 The Bridge on the River Kwai 




 Haha - I think people are on to you 




 There has never been a time where reading/hearing/seeing Karl hasn't made me laugh out loud 




 Inspired by /u/JG1991's question 




 Yeah, I actually think it's the closest in style and tone to the OT 




 Or the multiple of 2? 




 Then I don't think you understand what makes Star Wars so good and successful. It's a timeless story with relatable characters, something that a lot of movies in the 70s didn't have. Without it's special effects and wide appeal, we wouldn't have any of the blockbuster movies today.  




 C'mon dude! 




 Yeah, I've never understood why that would make it look any better  




 I agree with you on everything except George Miller emulating the style of Buster Keaton. Not in the slightest. Action-comedy is not what I'd call Mad Max. 




 Life, um, finds a way... 




 I think it would be *interesting* (not necessarily good) to see a sequel where all the classic animated characters are struggling in a world where CGI has taken over  




 Use a YouTube to MP3 downloader for the trailer and cut out that one line 




 So you'd rather pay extra for something you can accomplish in an easier way? 




  Iron Man

Comic hero 




  James Bond

Book character 




 Not OP, but I thought it was nothing but a typical action movie. Very little was there in terms of story or dialogue. 




 And it was really only Lucas himself that he saw potential in, not necessarily the movie. 




 :/ 




 I'm sure they would if a popular/critically acclaimed director were to do it - someone like Spielberg or Nolan (not to be circlejerky or anything) 




 Personally, I think those movies have lots of redeeming qualities. Special effects are nice, the whole "world building" is cool, Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson give good performances, and it was interesting to see what was going on in the Star Wars universe before the OT. 




 It already sort of is, and it's only been out for a little more than a week - I don't think there's anything to worry about  




 See:

Conquest of the Planet of the Apes 




 "Sorry, meant to say that" 




 "Yes" 




 Well, you can't call something overrated just because there's parts about it that you don't like... 




 "I really hate the fact that you made me waste the time typing letters into a search engine so I could figure out what you were talking about. I could've used that time to do a lot of other things. I appreciate your comment, but FYI, please try not to ruin my day again."

 Never seen it actually - the correct answer is Star Wars V 




 You should watch the documentary "Behind the Planet of the Apes" if you haven't seen it  




 No, it was Empire Strikes Back 




 No 




 Nope 




 Nope 




 Got it! 




 Here's 5:

1) ...
2) Planet of the Apes
3) Back to the Future
4) Jurassic Park
5) Jaws 




 Yeah, I figured, but you said *a* Bush, and not just Bush 




 Well, no matter what you say, it has undeniably had a humongous impact on popular culture and filmmaking as a whole. 




 They are still quality pieces of hardware and software  
























 I was just jokin' around dude, didn't mean for you to take it seriously. 




 Yup 




 It's pronounced Barometer, Jerry!

(I know it's the other way around) 




 Everyone has their own preferences.... 




 It won't. IIRC, Interstellar was filmed in 70mm, and it looked fine. 




 A /s might help communicate your point a little better, but it's still not hilariously funny.  




 It's *not* Star Wars The Force Awakens? 




 Huh, I had no idea. 




 Not ID Forever Part I? 




 Larry David never fails to make me laugh 




 I usually do Plinkett, then the 101 Wacky Jokes for Kids to prove that Plinkett's voice isn't actually like that, then Half in the Bag 




 I would think it was because it might cause confusion among people who saw Luke lose his blue lightsaber 




 DAE I know what u talking about rlm rite??????????????????? ayy lmao 




 I guess they didn't color it right for the trailer 




 It seems like Star Wars and Marvel are being saved for D23, and that's only a month later.  




 It's the percent of critics that liked it, not the actual rating of the film. I have no idea why Sharknado is at 82%, but you shouldn't say critics opinions are irrelevant because of it. 




 ? 




 Not his question.

 I wouldn't think so... 




 Darth Plagueis was Palpatine's master, as mentioned in Episode 3 




 Yes, because YouTube was so popular and different in the two years that it was around before Google bought it?

Google has owned YouTube for 9 years, a pretty significant portion of its lifetime. Not much has changed to drastically alter your viewing experience.

And by the way, it's not Googles fault for having to follow the law and take down clips that movie studios don't want on YouTube... 









 Notice anything...?

 I honestly felt that it was closest in style and tone to the OT. 




 Spielberg makes movies like that for any age - legitimately great storytelling 




 Mm... Maybe not as talked about in today's world, but by no means underrated. Fantastic reviews, good box office results, several Oscar nominations... 




 Steven Spielberg 









 Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (has a 6.1, but close enough!) I think that this is a legitimately good movie, with some good performances and underlying messages. 




 Each to his own, I guess, but no reason to call me a dweebo. I like Star Trek just as much, just so you know. 




 That's *Caitlyn* Fett now 




 Yeah 




 No, this is a well known fact that's true 




 I would agree, if it wasn't for movies like Birdman and The Grand Budapest Hotel 




 I wouldn't say boring. Maybe emotionless, but they looked cool  (IMO) 




 Sure they have a lot in common, but no one should try to point out which one is better than the other, cause there's really not an answer to that. 




 Missed a couple of lines there! 




 Met Jar Jar and Boss Nass... 




 They locked the door and tried to kill us 




 Star Wars all the way  




 Yup, all those hundreds of millions of dweebos. Complete idiots for liking a simple story with fun ideas and relatable characters. Morons.

/s 




 But it's almost like comparing boats and cars. One might be used more often, and they're both methods of transportation but they're used for two different things. 




 Alright, I guess I agree with that. 




 Well, it's kind of an obscure movie to put fake casting details on, especially ones that seem realistic. 




 I disagree. I don't think Star Wars is only an action movie, it has a lot of relatable human elements and themes, and is genuinely a well told story. 

Wars and Trek are about two different things, and I really don't think it's right to compare them. 




 No. No one does that. Crazy people do that. 




 That's gold, Jerry, GOLD! 




 Not just to me, but to many critics and movie goers alike. Look at the AFI top 100 movies, or the best movies on Rotten Tomatoes, or most critic's choices for the best movies of all time, and you'll see that Citizen Kane is high up on that list. 




 It's an absolute to you, but not to the majority of people who think it is the best movie of all time.  




 I suggest you watch The Godfather Part II. It's a more interesting/faster paced story, and it reveals more about Michael and Vito as characters. 




 But so many things *about* it shaped what came *after* it. It changed the industry as a whole, which is a very hard thing to do. 




 When did I say that? 




 Give me an example. 




 Because it's a practically perfect story, that's fantastically well written, with some of the best acting of all time. Very few flaws, if any.

 




 ... About what? 




 Yeah, but if you really want to know why it's considered the best movie of all time, watching it would help you understand what people are talking about.  




 Every moment you might think is cliche or overused? Citizen Kane started that. Appreciate it for what it is, and realize that modern filmmaking wouldn't be anywhere close to what it is today without that movie. 




 Everest? Macbeth? 




 Macbeth! Steve Jobs! Prometheus 2! X-Men Apocalypse! 




 This is actually the THIRD installment in the critically acclaimed Birds series!

http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0109275/ 




 Huh. I actually think Ewan McGregor could've been a good Bond 




 What? Like the original *didn't* have young children playing an important role in the movie? 









 Radio Bart will always hold a special place in my heart. Marge in Chains and Treehouse of Horror V are close behind, though. 




 Well, would you rather have a medium amount of good pizza, or all you can eat of pretty good pizza? 




 Too bad it's a true story.  




 Jurassic Park - Always amazing

Lost World - Liked it

JPIII - Bad, but entertaining and fun  




 What are you doing on this sub if you don't like their jokes? 

And by the way, you made a suggestion, and multiple people pointed out why it won't happen. No use arguing it. 




 REVAN CONFIRMED 




 MI: 5 




 I hate my life I hate my life I hate my life... 




 How? 




 "Knowing how to read will be useful when you're older"

Yup, checks out. 




 Back to the Future. 




 Too perfect. 




 Jack! Please! 




 I mean, there not even really that nerdy... 




 "Of all the souls I've encountered in my travels, his was the most... Human"

Was a hell of a thing when Spock died... 




 Mkay 




 Spike  




 Its based on a true story 




 And Andy! And Olaf! And Marbles! 




 Don't forget Westworld! 




 Oh I thought something looked strange about the rest of those guys... To tired to think 




 What? 




 /uj I don't know if it's part of the jerkin' or not, but Stanley Kubrick was American /uj 




 Not anymore it isn't! 




 The Empire Strikes Back 




  stage 19 elbow cancer 




 ["Why would you shoot me in the kidney?!"](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvYkmG5iGU) 




 It *is* an iPhone accessory  




 Dude, it's coming out years from now. I'm sure the script is still being worked on. No updates does not automatically mean it has been cancelled. 




 No 




 I would think its the writers more than the director  




 Wrath of Kahn? The Voyage Home? 




 I know what you mean, but pirates seem to smell lol chlorine to me 




 Agreed 




 Chlorine  




 It created a lot of the modern cinematography, lighting, makeup, and storytelling techniques that are commonplace today.

 Not just revolutionizing film at its time, but film as a medium in general. So much of TDK would be different if Citizen Kane didn't exist, and the same goes for every other modern movie. 




 No - episode vii this year, episode viii in 2017, and episode IX in 2019 




 Yeah, but Mike Stoklasa isn't anywhere near as well known as those guys 




 What? 




 Last Star Wars film in 2017? No way Jose! You still have Anthology 2 in 2018 and Episode IX in 2019, and I doubt Disney will stop there! 




 Maybe, maybe... 




 /u/trollabot test_subject3827 




 Yeah - above *Citizen Kane?* 




 Ah okay
