 Rowayton! But I live in LA now.  




 Ghost Beach
The Headless Ghost

And a few short stories. Something  about a lunchbox...  




 just seeing this, months later. I'm from Norwalk! 




 chaplin?  




 I'm about to crush some childhoods, but R.L. Stein had a large army of ghostwriters doing about 80% of his work. My mom was one of them. She wrote two books and a few short stories. He's cool and all, but it's the franchise that's even cooler.  




 Brenden, I'm a soccer comic.  




 oh man, this is my favorite joke and i use it all the time 




 as a long time redditor, and a long time friend of George's, I can only assure you that this mofo is only warming up.  




 hurray for wilton, ct! 




 bro so sick bro 




 I'm also from CT, and have totally been there. Awesome.  




 but seriously, what was this show called?  




 you rule.  
























 there's nothing more fun than looking back at the things you made in elementary school. if you're a parent, please save all your kids stuff.  




 this is my favorite thing i've seen all week. granted, it IS Monday, but i stand by what i said.  




 yes, i totally owned that.  




 what was this from? 




 I'm still mad at my brother for throwing mine down the stairs and breaking it. I told him this recently.  




 Great work! 




 you should be a tattoo artist!  




 I have the same TV. just thought you should know.  




 i love this. a lot.  




 I just let out a big ol' "awww" at work.  




 because he invented anti-cancer.  




 this made me laugh a lot, despite the fact that 32 people were most likely killed right after.  




 she actually did a few of those as well. and the Treehouse Times. a lot of those huge mega corp books hire out other people! bastards! 
























 I took this image from reddit a few months back. I'd really love to know who drew it!  




 "Sometimes you have to peel your own banana." 

It's from a kid's book of African short stories my mom used to read to my brother and I. Since then, it's become sort of a family montra.  









 "I murdered and ate my last girlfriend and everyone found out so I'm waiting until it all blows over until I strike again." 




 another deep fryer 




 tumblr. 




 the smell! 




 WHEEEEERE? 




 i concur. perhaps 'nerdy dad goose.' 




 I'm really bad a beat boxing, but when no one's around, I beat box my face off.  




 I do the same thing but with great Roman warriors 




 what about reading about playing, written by 4 year old bumblefuck? that sounds hilarious.  




 SURF REDDIT ALL DAY MOFOS 
























 Go get checked. I just had a cancer scare and it was no fun.  




 I will be seeing you at the Hollywood Bowl on October 8th. Can we hang out?  




 i was sooo close to photoshopping this same exact thing. you win!  




 yeah! 




 ahhh you got me! 




 I was just in line at the bank. The guy in front of me was some creepy old guy wearing a AAA uniform. The girl behind me was an attractive Latina nurse. 

So the old guy starts hitting on the nurse pretty hard. Calls her spicy, compliments her figure and generally eye-fucks her the whole time. I could tell that she was getting really uncomfortable, and felt like I should intervene. I mean, I was sandwiched between them so it's not like I could ignore it all. So, I did what I do best: I start hitting on the old pervert. Hardcore. 

I generally repeated the things he said to her, complimented his mustache and uniform and said it would look best on my bedroom floor. I even winked a few times. I could tell this guy was incredibly homophobic and hated the fact that he was getting hit on by a guy. He did, however, understand the point I was making and got out of line and left. He even apologized. 

The girl thanked me and said she'd never seen anyone do that. I just replied that I'm always happy to fight fire with fire. 

So is this something I can get knighted for? I'd love to be knighted.  




 they do in my heart 




 great, now i'm turned on at work 




 More times than you'd think. I should also add that I owned a toy from the smash hit FLUBBER that would dance from sound activation. If I started clapping, shit would go crazy.  




 From ages 8-10 (roughly). It was great.  




 clearly i should stay off the internet. thanks!  




 got em!
