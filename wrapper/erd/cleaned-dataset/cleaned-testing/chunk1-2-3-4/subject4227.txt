 You look like Craig Feldspar. 




 Yes, do this! 
























 Whenever someone puts "the" before a minority.  




 This hangover is killing me. I knew I shouldn't have had that last shot, but man that girl was fine as hell. How could I turn down a drink from such a hot girl? Perks of being the Alpha I  guess. These pledges really stepped up this year. I'm impressed. They even used real handcuffs. They probably could've picked a better place to stash is though. This girl's apartment isn't very intimidating, and the blood is obviously fake. The corn syrup was a good choice, but the food coloring is too dark. Rookie mistake. 

Nothing. I guess he's still out. At least the chair is comfortable. I really have to pee though. They need to hurry this up already. I have class at noon. It's not like I was going to go anyway. 

"Hey! I have to piss! Someone come let me out already!" 

Someone's coming. The steps are soft. 

"So, you're finally awake?"

Wow. Maybe I misjudged these pledges after all. Sending a girlfriend to take care of me? What a bunch of assholes. I deserve more respect than that. 

"Tell them to come out here. They already won, so there's no need to keep the game going." 

She looks familiar. Is it the girl from last night? No, she was blonde. Why is she smiling like that? She must be stupid. 

"I already got them."

Got them? What is she talking about? This doesn't make sense.

"What? You got them?"

"Yes, your friends. I got them. They're gone. You are the only one left." 

"What are you talking about?" 

"You really don't remember?"

"Last night? No I blacked out."

"Not last night you idiot! The party two years ago."

This girl is making no sense. What party? This is so stupid. I have to pee. This girl she does look familiar though. Damn, I really have to pee. 

"Look, I have to pee. Can't you just..."

What is wrong with this girl. Women are so stupid. You can never trust them to do things right. They're only good for sex. Fucking women. 

"You, and your friends, took everything from me that night! Now I'm going to take everything from you."

She's laughing? I don't see how this is funny. This has gone too far. 

"I just want to take a shower and drink now. The game is over. I have to piss, and I have class. Enough is enough."

This day is wasted. Fucking pledges and their stupid girlfriends. 

"You still don't remember? You still don't get it? You... 
Do know I'm going to kill you right?"

"HAHAHA! Ok! You got me! I'm scared! You hear that pledges? Your little girl is really scary! Game over! Let me go now!"

"You are a very stupid person. You'll realize that before the end."

This girl. She is so... She is the girl from last night! I guess she was wearing a wig. I know her from somewhere else though. Where is she going? What is that in her hand? Is that a knife? 

"Two years ago, You and your little frat buddies decided it would be fun to... What's the phrase you used? That's right! You thought it would be fun to 'run a train' on a girl.You thought it would be fun to take the innocence of a helpless young girl for hours! Well, I would take your innocence to make it even, but you don't have any. I think I'll penetrate you for hours just like you did to me. Then, we'll be even."

Wait! It's her! It's the girl! Oh shit! Oh shit no! Oh god I'm gonna die! Oh god! 

"Are you pissing your pants? What a coward. I wonder if you'll scream louder than the others. Apparently having your dick cut off is extremely painful..."

"Wait please!"

"Too late... Asshole."


 




 "Fascist!" 
























 I think Leibniz solved the problem of evil pretty well. At least better than many of the competing theories that come from your average modern Christian. Basically God in his infinite knowledge created our universe. Our universe was the best possible option, which includes not mKing the universe at all. The current reality that we live in has the least amount of evil possible, and it is still better than the option of not existing. Keep in mind this is a very basic outline of the Leibniz's argument.  




 Why don't they just invest that money into hiring people to pick up the dog poop?  




 No, roommates are the worst. Nothing good will ever come from having a roommate. 
























 You're absolutely right, and you are making some fine points. I'm not disagreeing with you. I'm just presenting a view that agrees with Christian beliefs that I feel is better than the average Christian argument for the problem of evil. The most common answer I've heard is that "it is beyond human understanding." And you're right, this is a non answer. All I'm saying, however, is that if you're going to present a non answer to the problem of evil, then you might as well pick a good one based on logical proofs and arguments. This is better than just stating that humans cannot understand God in my opinion. I'm not presenting this as a solution. I'm not presenting this as my opinion. I was just trying to point out that Leibniz has a pretty good theory that coincides with Christian arguments and beliefs. That doesn't mean that it solves the problem of evil. If it did, then nobody would use the problem of evil as a criticism against God and monotheistic beliefs. Leibniz presents a logical argument that allows the problem of evil to be circumvented while still maintaining the integrity of God. If you disagree with it, then that's fine. If you want to say it's wrong, then you have to find a fault in his argument. I'm not leaning one way or the other. I just thought that monotheists might want to take a look at Leibniz's theory to help them argue their points. Everyone knows that it's hard enough for them to explain themselves without relying on the bible or faith. I'm not saying that this view is of any particular moral worth either. It is simply an explanation of why there is evil. Another major reason why God in Leibniz's theory can't make any less evil is because how time and space work in the creation of the universe. Like I said, Leibniz's discourse is a good read, and it will explain his theory better than I ever could. If you don't want to take a look at it, then that's fine. It will expand your mind and your opinions though.  




 I disagree. I think that it's fine for them to have faith, but that shouldn't be a cheat code used to end philosophical arguments when things aren't going their way.  




 You should read Leibniz's Discourse on Metaphysics. It spells it out much clearer than I did. I'm not saying that it's the best view, but it is a complete theory that isn't based the idea that God created good and the devil created evil. It actually provides an answer. And essentially yes, this is the best possible reality or universe that could have possibly been created. You can't know that though because it is beyond human understanding. If you can poke holes in Leibniz's argument, then I would be very interested to hear how you did that. Otherwise it's just another competing theory. I could care less one way or the other though because I'm agnostic. I was simply stating that Leibniz has a pretty solid answer to the question of evil that coincides with what Christians believe in. It was merely a suggestion that Christians should adopt this theory, or a different complete philosophical view, in order to argue this point. To me, this is better than shouting bible quotes or using circular arguments. This at least a theory that I can respect because it is based on good logic, and Leibniz was a freaky genius guy that that makes his argument pretty strong against criticism.
