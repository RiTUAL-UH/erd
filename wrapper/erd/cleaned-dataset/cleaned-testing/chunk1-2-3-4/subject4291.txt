 I grew up bilingual. So grateful. Definitely gonna raise any kids I may have speaking 2 or more languages. 
























 I definitely prefer Chii's rendition. In general I don't like a lot of KPP's music, save for a few songs. "Fun" is a good word to describe her music in general, in my opinion.  




 You've given us quite the taxing challenge. How about "Washing"? Could you afford us more characters? This really constitutes a problem...

Sorry I don't have anything better :(  




 I just found this. imo she sounds amazing!

And she's hoping to go professional:

Any redditors want to aid me in supporting her dream?! 




 Is it better to play someone old, that you've played many times and has had quite an impact on your life, or to play something you haven't played, but you know the franchise, the mechanics, the rough story line etc? Is the (relativity small) novel experience more valuable than the nostalgic experience? 




 I feel like I should know this, but what's that from? 




 Obama sucking Hitler 









 Man, what kind of birthday songs are your friends and family into? That sounds messed up. 




 They will look up and ask "Tell us about Bryson" and I will whisper "no".
 




 This had bugged me for some time, being a Belgian studying in America. I grew up speaking Dutch and French, so whenever an American pronounces a typical Dutch/French word incorrectly, it gets under my skin. 
One recent example is my professors pronunciation of 'apartheid'. In Afrikaans or Dutch it should be pronounced something like 'apart hide', but my profs use the American 'th' pronunciation in the word.

Am I in the wrong here? If no, what are foreign words that get mispronounced that really bug you? 









 Tough project. You may want to start with a clean slate. 





























 Ouch. Maybe you'll find some middle ground that works for both of you? 




 Oh dang. Good to know. Thanks for the replies, it's been very enlightening (since I was considering JET myself).  




 Is that amount of money a living wage in Japan? And I'm assuming you enjoy your job/stay in Japan? 




 Ouch, sorry to hear about that. 




 If/when you do take her out, does she liven up after a while? Perhaps it'll just take some time for her to adjust to being more social.  




 How'd she become an ex, if you don't mind my asking? 




 English as a Foreign Language, iirc 




 What's it like? Are you on JET? If so, would you say it's worth it?

 I was lost while trying to get to a late evening meeting in Melbourne (I was an exchange student). My phone's GPS didn't work abroad, and I didn't have the sense to print a map before leaving. I had no idea where I was or which direction to go in, so I ask a random person on the street for directions. He says I'm about five miles from where I need to be, and there aren't tram that could take me there. He offers me a ride, which despite being super weird, I accept. I would have been late otherwise. 

In his car we got a bit conversation going. I asked him what he does. He was the [mayor of Yarra City](http://www.yarracity.vic.gov.au/Your-Council/Councillors/cr-geoff-barbour-mayor/). I was dumbfounded. Awesome guy. He was up for re-election, so I made sure to tell my Aussie pals about this encounter (some of whom called bullshit).

tldr; lost in Melbourne City, got ride from random stranger who turned out to be the mayor. 




 Sheeple. 




 I owe it to him to never stop searching. But what if he didn't actually throw the ball? 




 I agree with this. There's too much government secrecy as is. That said, the issue of politicians blindly voting along party lines is still one that needs to be addressed, as well as the issue of politicians not understanding what they're voting for (my favorite example is [this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/08/florida-banned-computers_n_3561701.html)). 




 This way, uninformed politicians would be kept out of blindly voting along party lines. As an added bonus, you'd be able to see which politicians are roadkill (i.e. not reading anything, thereby not voting on anything).

The quiz would likely need to be created by professional lawpersons, and would need to be kept in strict secrecy for this to work. 
 




 Belgium here. If you see someone you don't usually see (i.e. someone not from work/school/etc) three times in a day, you must go drinking with them that evening. 




 That pun makes me so angry I might flip a bit. 
























 Contestants go through different trials with weapons they made themselves out of Lego only. If the weapon breaks during a trial, the contestant is disqualified. Trials may include timed challenges, tests of strength, and even contestant-on-contestant close combat.  




 Bread + Nutella 




 Pretty accurate! 




 Honestly, what I miss most is just a genuine interest in being with me/around me. I don't consider myself particularly outgoing, or funny, or any other quality someone would want to be around. So now I rather miss that.

That being said, the reason we broke up is because I moved to a different country for school and work. We probably could have had something nice if I'd realized it at the time.  




 You can allow extensions in incognito mode. 




 Yes! I do the same :D 




 Yes. Let's do it! 




 Came here to post that same solution. Works miracles when I need to get stuff done.

 Empathy is such a valuable skill that makes such a big difference. Couldn't agree more :)

 So true. I've been told that many times [unfortunately]

 YOLO is considerably shorter than FI,IGTDA. 
























 Erm, how so? How does one live lavishly on minimum wage? Or did I miss a sarcasm / tag? 




 Agreed. From the other comments, the show would need to be about millionaires who inherited their wealth.   




 Hahaha... riiiiight 




 That is a really good point. Completely agree! 




 I guess the point would be to have them help others of their own volition, rather than having them help others "because it's the format of the show". Then again, there's no telling how they would react once they get their money back. 









 Yeah, absolutely. The knowledge that they'd be able to go back to riches would indeed be the weak link in the show. 




 That's why it's a 'Crazy' idea I guess :( 




 Hahaha that they are! 




 Interesting - I'll look into it more. Though from the description of the show it seems like the donation seems like the more key feature, which I don't particularly like :\ 




 I like it! 




 Hah! Yes! 




 Agreed. Was going to say a year originally, but that may be too harsh (and impractical to film). 




 Me too, but hey, in the USA most them are millionaires at the very least. They'd be eligible to be part of the show anyway :D 




 They would also be cut off from their own house(s), car(s), etc... but instead given 'average' lodging and vehicles comparable to what minimum wage workers make. 

Edit: The people on this show would be either politicians or millionaires who inherited their money - people that worked for their fortune wouldn't be a good fit. 




 Yes. So much yes. 









 I came here to post the same info. Thank you! 




 Would subscribe. Let me know when it's up :D
