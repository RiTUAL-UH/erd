 It actually blows my mind that America was ever close to Pakistan. Popular sentiment in India is probably very pro-American, but is the opposite for large parts of Pakistan. 




 China is slowly repositioning its economy as it looks like its going for a soft landing -- no way in hell the leaders there will let Russia fuck with its plans. Not only that, but the only friendly connection to Russia is historical. They would lose almost all political support with the world if they sided with Russia. China really wants to prove that it can be a proper world power, not one that is isolated from everyone else. Not only that, but popular sentiment is pro-American. 




 In that case doesn't that count as attempted murder? 




 At least some part of the Ukraine government knows how to play the long game. Regardless of the short term consequences, Putin has most definitely lost. In the medium to long term most European and former Soviet countries are thinking twice about dealing with Russia. Expect new oil and gas agreements to start popping up. You have massive wealth loss in Russia. You're starting to get protests in Moscow too. There is no way in which Russia comes out of this crisis in better shape than when it entered, even if it annexed all of Ukraine. When the only people on your side are Syria and Iran, and the people on the fence are having second thoughts, then the geopolitical game will finish you off. It's what happened in the 80s when the USSR finally collapsed (when Middle Eastern oil made short work of the Russian economy), and it will happen again if Putin continues to put his short term pride over long term prudence. 




 Nokia too. AFAIK there was also some kind of weird tax break and they actually bought the company out at a huge discount after the first announced price. 




 I've mentioned this in a few threads now, but wanted to point it out again: this plane was communicating with the satellite for much longer than anyone thought. Wasn't it supposed to land at 8:30am in Beijing that day? It was still pinging when it was supposed to be in China airspace! The fact that it can fly for six hours without anyone noticing blows my mind. 




 Look at that quote: "According to the new data, the last confirmed communication between the plane and the satellite was at 8.11am (Malay time) Saturday 8th March." That thing was in the air for a *long time*. AFAIK, it might have still been communicating with the satellite when it was supposed to land in Beijing! AFAIK the transponder signal was flipped off at ~1-2am, which means this thing was in the air for a solid 6 hours without anyone noticing. 




 Man, this guy is slower than Shatner.

Edit: Holy fuck, this guy just said it was still communicating with the satellite at 8am. 




 It could be that something went wrong for the hijackers and they were dumb enough to not have a backup plan. So they tried to fly it somewhere else and ran out of fuel. 




 No kidding. For the sake of comparison, my friends who did not graduate from a top-tier law school are having problems getting by while paying off their loans. Not to mention some of them who graduated without offers were pretty much completely fucked. 




 The problem is making those student loan payments with a "small" job. There are many people who come out of law school without offers from a firm, and barely scrape by trying to make payments. 




 It is antagonistic and stupid when all it takes is a simple 5 second google search for "Glyphosate". Some people refuse to be open minded and just yell out "source?" when they in fact are just too lazy to do their own research. 




 I wouldn't be worried about them dropping Drive, but Google has a track record recently of limiting integration with other services. 




 Have you tried fetching data from it though? I've had friends who tried to do a restore and they said it was really slow. 




 The problem is with zoning laws. Unless you are living way out there, it is unfortunately very difficult to get a development made out of shipping containers even if you are in the suburbs. 




 What is the endgame there? Let's say there was an actual hostage/ransom negotiation that the Malaysian government was involved in. The longer they keep this from the public, the worse they will look in the end. 




 With regards to #2, it's really hard to land a plane anywhere in that part of the world without anyone noticing. It's one of the most populated regions on the planet. 




 Yes, but I don't think shooting at a tweaked out road rager would be a good idea. Unless you're a professional and can take him out with the few bullets that you have, I think you'd just enrage the driver more and get run over. 




 I'd get one for the rear view too! 




 We try to communicate with these animals because they're at least genetically similar enough to share some behavioral traits. We're genetically 70% identical to zebrafish, and much closer to the animals you mentioned. Given the fact that life likely started at completely disparate times in the Universe, it's likely that the genetic/"functional" difference between any extraterrestial and us would be like how we look at E. coli. 




 Your mortgage is my monthly rent for a 1 bedroom apartment in the Bay Area.... :( 




 I played up to a few levels into the Arson stage. The game is just incredibly repetitive, with interrogation options that make no sense. Gunfights were a total joke too. The voice acting is pretty decent, but the plot was basically going slower than molasses.  




 Inland crash would come with fire and smoke, which would be easy to spot  by air or satellite. 




 I think it's more useful to look at effect size, in conjunction with p-value. This is a "non-drug" based approach to cancer therapy, with a good number of patients achieving remission. That kind of change in survival is practically unheard of for 99% of cancer drugs in Phase 1. 




 Not to be too much of an optimist here, but even for a Phase 1 trial full remission is nothing to sneeze at. That's a gigantic effect size, considering that most drugs only extend survival by months to at most a year. I haven't read the full details of this trial (or much about it in the literature), but if we can get cancer immunotherapy to work on solid tumors then it is definitely game changing. 




 I second that. Dry ice can last a long time in a covered (not sealed) styrofoam container! 




 What about used lab equipment on places like LabX or laboratory surplus stores? 




 Man, there are tons of Canadian racists in this sub-thread. Kind of shocking. I grew up in Alberta so I thought I've seen everything too. 




 By and large first-generation immigrants (especially labor or service work) do not mix well. These are the ones who come to Canada to primarily have a better life for their children. Canadian children born to immigrant parents generally do much better at integration, end up being well-educated, and have much better economic outcomes compared to their parents. 




 I'm a Canadian living in the USA for the past 8 years.

Let's be fair here: when stratifying by ethnic groups, standards of living in Canada are by and large **much** better than the USA. It's not even a fair contest. Crime rates in Canada are downright laughable compared to the USA. It is true that jobs are segregated across racial lines but that is changing a lot as the children of immigrants get out of college, start second-generation families, and compete with white folk for top-tier jobs. 




 With respect to the first point: how do you think the World Cup is going to be? I was a little apprehensive when they had it in South Africa but that ended up being pretty much okay. 




 My current girlfriend always compliments on my "bone structure". She was talking about my face and not my penis, but to this day I don't really know what she means. 




 I asked my girlfriend recently about whether she likes forearms and she said "What? No, that sounds ridiculous." Not sure if it's as common as the internet makes it out to be... 




 Not to mention that in many European countries, children are "tiered off" at an early age into brackets that determine your future career. Movement between these tiers is extremely hard. But in this way you game the "Math and Sciences" exams because the students who take them are already selected to be smart. 




 Can you use this to install Google apps such as Hangouts? I desperately depend on a hardware qwerty but I use Hangouts a lot to chat. 




 To be fair, not all of us who favor intervention are in favor of military action. There are a lot of steps to go before you send in soldiers. Fundamentally I think the notion that another country's problems are not our owns is somewhat racist. It's like saying their own problems are not worth addressing. There are non-profit programs all over the world that work in health and education and people support the development of these infrastructures, but as soon as civil strife and violence comes in everybody throws their hands up and says "not our problem" when civil society is one of the most important aspects of ensuring day-to-day stability. It's like saying that these other countries aren't "good enough" or "civilized enough" to join the world society at large. 




 It's ridiculous, really. We expect college students to be able to plan out their lives in **freshman/sophomore** year and criticize them for choosing the "wrong" major, but we pretty much give every adult a pass when they have to make the same choice. 




 No way, China knows not to fuck with the US. Going SE into Asia is a bad idea when there is a SK/NK conflict going on, because that would mean a two-pronged war at their doorstep. Three-pronged, if Japan decides to jump in for fun. 




 Let's be fair here -- they removed Russian as an official language in the East on the first day of the "new" parliament, which prompted massive protests. Many cabinet members in the current government were part of a far-right nationalist party as well. The ethnic tensions go **both** ways. 




 How do medical professionals protect themselves from this kind of thing on a daily basis? Do doctors and nurses get sick more often compared to the general population? 




 Palo Alto is a disaster in the summer time. There's no central AC anywhere and apartments boil. 




 Too late, some aspiring screenwriter probably saw this and is writing a script now. 




 I think this is great news, and validates a few things: (1) viral load is a pretty good predictor of infectiousness, (2) basic molecular biology models of the disease hold up: if you have low levels of the virus, you're not going to infect another person, (3) heterosexual couples where the male is HIV+ could easily bear children who are HIV-, and (4) if this study were expanded to more people and longer time points, ART could essentially eradicate HIV over time regardless if couples have sex with or without condoms. HIV+ patients could possibly lead even more normal lives than previously thought. 




 Also easier to reduce tax breaks for gains from real estate, or heavily tax people who own multiple houses (not multi-unit apartments) with high net worth. 




 Perfect example: the Philippines. I think I saw an article about how a naval ship was using the power plant on board to generate fresh water for people. 




 A coffee maker is too inconvenient, and the water doesn't get hot enough to extract nice flavors. Here's an easier method:

1. https://shoponline.melitta.com/items/COFFMKRSPROVER
2. Boil water
3. 3 Tbsp of coffee
4. Pour hot water onto grounds. If you are really fancy you could pour at a constant rate like those hipsters do. I just fill it to the top because I don't care.
5. Drink. Throw away filter.

 




 If people start starving like in Soviet times, they will most definitely revolt against him -- that time wasn't so long ago.

Edit: not to mention that the internet makes a lot of propaganda completely useless, especially in the big cities that matter (eg. St. Petersburg and Moscow). 




 So, if an eagle decides to fuck you up, what's the second person gonna do? I'm pretty sure that it'll still end badly. 





























 I'm looking for one to do microfluidic mold prototyping, as it looks like the cost and turnaround time would blow current methods out of the water. The only issue is that a lot of 3D printers have poor resolution. I'd like to use one that has resolution in the 10-100 micron range. Are there any in the market that can do that? The height of the layers should be in the same range too. Price isn't really an issue, but I'm hoping for 10k if that's possible.

Edit: price is not really a concern -- it's going into a grant application anyway so other things can be budgeted accordingly. 









 Obama is eager to fly drones and do airstrikes in an easily radicalized region and provoking extremist groups, but doesn't want to touch a region that only "has a potential" for future radicalization. I'm not saying he should bomb or invade Syria, but Obama doesn't seem to be interested in anything beyond waving a finger in their direction. There is a lot of room for diplomatic work but we haven't seen anything substantial for the past two years. What gives? 
























 Here's my favorite: not practicing proper hygiene in order to "train the immune system". That's not how it works... 



















 The Pathogenic Role of Intestinal Flora in IBD and Colon Cancer
Author: Rescigno, Maria
Source: Current Drug Targets, Volume 9, Number 5, May 2008 , pp. 395-403(9)

http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cdt/2008/00000009/00000005/art00007

The intestine is populated by a large variety of microorganisms that colonize the host soon after birth. The gut microflora contributes to several intestinal functions, including the development of the mucosal immune system, the absorption of complex macromolecules, the synthesis of aminoacids and vitamins and the protection against pathogenic microorganisms. Its composition varies along the different segments of the gut, with a gradient from the stomach to the colon where it is more abundant. Given the vital relationship between the microflora and the intestinal function, it is important that the microflora is kept continuously under control so to preserve gut homeostasis. When this is not achieved or perturbed, several immune disorders can arise, like allergies or inflammation. Protracted immune deregulations can also lead to severe disorders including diabetes, cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is therefore crucial that the immune system learns both to tolerate and to control the growth of beneficial microorganisms so to preserve the intestinal homeostasis. The mechanisms that are in place to achieve this control are not yet understood but recent work has started to unravel the complex relationship between several players including the microflora, intestinal barriers and immune cells. In this review we will analyze how the microflora interacts with the host and how deregulation of this interaction can lead to inflammatory disorders and eventually also to cancer. 




 I eat at least 2-3 cups of cereal for breakfast, so I tend to go through a box every 3 or 4 days. I typically eat the healthy kind too (eg. multi whole grain flakes) so it's become a non-trivial cost. Does anyone have a good recipe for homemade cereal flakes? I'm not a big fan of granola (scratches my mouth too much), and the recipes that I've found online look like blogspam or haven't had much of a discussion about taste/quality. 




 Honestly, I'm pretty good at cleaning a room but the thought of dusting something has never occurred to me. She mentioned something about some kind of spray and a towel? What am I supposed to be wiping? And the fan in my room is absolutely caked in dust -- how do I clean that without spreading dust everywhere? Also, my down duvet spreads little feathers everywhere and I don't have a good way of wiping those off surfaces.

TL;DR - Girlfriend wants me to wipe down my room and I don't know how. Not a euphemism! 




 I'm going to be buying a new notebook pretty soon, and I'm torn between getting a beefy one with a decent graphics card versus an ultrabook/ultraportable. Most of my time is actually spent doing academic work and doesn't require much graphics muscle, but from time to time I like to play the occasional video game. I'm also pretty tired of turning my graphics to low and 800x600 resolution just to get a playable framerate.

Enter Onlive. Can I use this with a decent academic internet connection, and will it play nice with integrated graphics? I'm also worried about any latency issues too. The great thing about it is that I can play pretty much any game I want without worrying about system requirements. The problem is that I haven't read many recent reviews since its initial release nor have I read many anecdotes about whether the service is any good... 




 Fabrication of polypyrrole micropatterns through microchannel-confined electropolymerization and their electrical conductivities  

Electrochimica Acta, Volume 54, Issue 17, 1 July 2009 , Pages 4253-4257

"Creating micropatterns of electrically conductive polymers on solid substrates is important for the low-cost construction of organic microelectronic devices. This work develops a novel strategy for the preparation of large-area polypyrrole (Ppy) micropatterns through area-selected in situ electropolymerization of pyrrole within microchannels. The effects on micropattern formation of electropolymerization procedures such as dynamic potential polymerization (DPP), static potential polymerization (SPP), and constant current polymerization (CCP), the solvent, and the polymerization time were studied systematically. The electrical conductivities of the Ppy micropatterns were measured and compared with a homogeneous Ppy thin film synthesized under the same conditions. Given the straightforward and versatile nature of this method, it is expected to contribute greatly to the convenient fabrication of low-cost organic microelectronic devices."

"The adsorption of various carboxylic acids onto alumina substrates has been studied as a model system for the study of the long range hydrophobic interaction. The adsorption was studied using classical adsorption isotherms, contact angle measurements and colloid probe atomic force microscopy. Carboxylic acids form esters with the hydroxyl groups present on the alumina surface and produce surfaces with a range of hydrophobicities and stabilities depending on the acid's functionality. Hydrocarbon carboxylic acid adsorption was found to be adequately described by the Langmuir adsorption model and produced stable surfaces of varying hydrophobicities which resisted dissolution by water. By comparison, hydrophobic surfaces produced with fluorinated acids adsorbed from aqueous solution were not always stable, although their stability was greatly improved when the chemisorption was carried out in a non-aqueous solvent at elevated temperatures. Adsorption of these fluorinated carboxylic acids produced the most hydrophobic surfaces. Interaction forces between alumina surfaces coated with adsorbed propionic acid were as expected from DLVO theory with no evidence of hydrophobic forces."

 




 Way back before Ron Paul became a candidate to be taken seriously (think Election 2008 and before), he was pretty much loved by Reddit and especially on r/politics. Since then the subreddit became a little too spammy for me so I removed it from my front page, but I decided to check it out again because of the coming election. How does the community feel about him these days now that he's been given much, much more airtime to voice his platform (especially during the debates) and is being substantially less marginalized this election?  




 You know what I mean -- a protocol isn't working, and you google it online. The results are pure garbage. I would imagine that this would only be useful for grad students, which would clear out all the undergrad homework help threads. Also, I think it would be great for just general suggestions/advice for good control experiments/help with data analysis. Of course, a lot of the threads can't be too specific because of publication concerns, but I think that we can keep it solidly based on methods help. The only issue is that a subreddit like this would need lots of people.... 














 It's becoming clear that the current patchwork of deficit reduction and continual small scale stimulus isn't going to turn around the economy. Corporations are hoarding profits, maximizing productivity from their existing staff, and minimizing new hires. The United States is getting their asses kicked by globalization, especially in terms of manufacturing. It is inevitable that several industries that we take for granted in this country will cease to exist in a decade's time. If you were the President of the United States, what policies would you implement to create job growth and transform this country? 














 Some posts (like the Oslo one on the front page right now) deserve to be on the top spot for a day or two. Yet, it will fall off the front page because of the post's age. How about a separate voting scheme of whether a post stays "stickied" at the top or not, or at least a modification of up/downvotes so that a submission's lifetime is higher? 














 I haven't gone out to see the fireworks in years, and last time was at the Hatch Shell (which was an... interesting... experience). Does anyone have any protips for the holiday? Some friends and I are heading out to see the fireworks but I don't really want to head down into the Esplanade. I've heard the Longfellow and Harvard bridges are good but crowded. Is it as bad as they say or does it get better if you walk closer to the middle? Or is there somewhere else that works much better? 




 I've been thinking of setting up Sharepoint Foundation or Office 365 for my lab, so that we could collaborate on paper writing, data sharing, internal wikis, etc. We already have a wiki set up for things like lab inventory and scheduling, but currently document writing is still a huge mess where we email back and forth drafts and get confused over the version number. Office 365/Sharepoint Foundation sounds like it might be a good fit because it hooks directly into Word (some people in our lab are not so tech savvy). The only problem is that there is no way to try those out before we take the plunge (Office 365 would work out to about $100/month and the beta is ending in a day or two. To use Sharepoint Foundation we need a beefy computer and that costs some money too). Are there any alternative solutions we can try out? I've thought about using Office Web Apps for collaboration, but many of us don't have/want a Windows Live ID and Google Docs is sorely lacking. 









 Hi everyone! I'm part of a Harvard graduate student science outreach club that hosts a lecture series on current science topics. Tomorrow we're going to be hosting a seminar on the origins and applications of pluripotent stem cells. In the past two lectures we've had we had amazing attendance for topics such as sleep and black holes, so this one should be good too! Our lecturers are given by Harvard graduate students working directly in the field. Given that reddit is a pretty science-friendly crowd, I figure that I should at least give a shout to my favorite internet community. :)

The lecture is happening tomorrow, June 1st, at 7pm at the Harvard Department of Chemistry Pfizer Hall (12 Oxford St). (http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d source=embed saddr= daddr=42.377334,-71.115704 hl=en geocode= mra=mift mrsp=1 sz=18 sll=42.377758,-71.115242 sspn=0.00256,0.005681 ie=UTF8 ll=42.377758,-71.115242 spn=0.002774,0.00456 z=17 and street view at http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q source=embed hl=en geocode= q=12+Oxford+St,+Cambridge,+MA+02138 aq=0 sll=37.0625,-95.677068 sspn=44.928295,93.076172 ie=UTF8 hq= hnear=12+Oxford+St,+Cambridge,+Massachusetts+02138 layer=c cbll=42.377093,-71.115995 panoid=dTwRfBoOZfu_h3f2h-ccQQ cbp=13,24.37,,0,-6.71 ll=42.377093,-71.115995 spn=0,0.048237 z=14).

 Hey, thanks for those who did come out to the one we had two weeks ago on Black Holes (http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/h1no2/event_free_harvard_science_lecture_on_current/). We had about an attendance of 60+ people from the Boston community. This week we're going to talk about a topic that is dear to everyone's hearts: sleep. How does sleep work? What benefits does the brain gain from it? Do we need it?

As said in the other topic, in full disclosure I'm part of the organizing committee on this event and I thought it would be fun to spread this out to my favorite internet community, in which I've laid the smackdown sometimes (fine, occasionally) on r/science. It's a completely free lecture, no registration required. We're a Harvard graduate student organization dedicated to science outreach for the general public. Our website is https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/.

Event Details: May 18th at 7pm, at 12 Oxford St. (Harvard Dept of Chemistry). You have to go in the side door (http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q source=s_q hl=en geocode= q=12+Oxford+St,+Cambridge,+MA+02138 aq=0 sll=37.0625,-95.677068 sspn=44.928295,93.076172 ie=UTF8 hq= hnear=12+Oxford+St,+Cambridge,+Massachusetts+02138 ll=42.376998,-71.115961 spn=0.001286,0.00284 z=19 layer=c cbll=42.377093,-71.115995 panoid=dTwRfBoOZfu_h3f2h-ccQQ cbp=12,5.93,,0,-5.69) at the very far end of the building to the right.

Hope to see you there!! 




 Hey Redditors! We (Science in the News, a Harvard grad student science outreach organization) are hosting a spring lecture series on current science topics. The speakers are all young graduate students and the lectures are geared for general non-specialist audiences. 

The first one is on May 4th (this wednesday!) at 7pm, and is going to be on black holes. It's being held at Harvard's Department of Chemistry at 12 Oxford Street. Our website is at https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu and you can find the full details and schedule there, but I can also answer any questions. Hope to see some redditors there!

UPDATE: Hope to see some of you tomorrow! Here are the directions: https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/directions/ and the building is the one on the right hand side: http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q source=s_q hl=en geocode= q=12+Oxford+St,+Cambridge,+MA+02138 aq=0 sll=37.0625,-95.677068 sspn=44.928295,93.076172 ie=UTF8 hq= hnear=12+Oxford+St,+Cambridge,+Massachusetts+02138 ll=42.376998,-71.115961 spn=0.001286,0.00284 z=19 layer=c cbll=42.377093,-71.115995 panoid=dTwRfBoOZfu_h3f2h-ccQQ cbp=12,5.93,,0,-5.69 




 So my girlfriend (also a redditor) is looking to buy a new laptop. We agreed that it would be easier for me to post this since I can better explain her needs. 

She's looking for a laptop 14" and under that is pretty durable and can be taken around a foreign country while she does fieldwork (non-technical) on a semi-permanent basis. Basically, she is just using basic office applications and watching hulu or dvds or video chatting when she has free time. I've recommended the Lenovo T420 or T420s to her because it has a good balance of both mobility (weight and battery life) and durability. I've also considered the Macbook Pro 13 or the Macbook Air 13 but the issues with those are the poor screen resolution in the former and price of both. Because she will be doing fieldwork it would be hard to get service for it at an Apple store but Lenovo has pretty extensive worldwide support. Also, I question the value/struggle of learning a supposedly easier operating system when she has other more important academic matters to deal with. Are there any other computers that I have missed, or should I go for any of the computers that I've mentioned (Lenovo and Apple)? 




 For example, chemistry has many top-notch journals that accept one or two pagers for work that is short and sweet. Why isn't this the case in biology? I understand the need for publishing a complete story (see: Cell), but even Nature and Science publications average 3-4 pages and should really only be for your career's best work. The whole spending your whole PhD/postdoc hoping for one big publication isn't very sustainable in the long run, so why do journals keep perpetuating this problem? 




 I'm not exactly sure how this would potentially work, but for really long multi-levelled threads that stagger back and forth it's hard to see who is commenting to what. It would be nice to have a little icon on each comment that you can mouseover to see what the immediate parent is. Of course, it wouldn't be very useful to see what the parent's parent is, but it would be better than nothing. 




 Also, I plan to keep this laptop for 3-4 years. Is there any point in getting the accidental or extended warranties?

Edit: I plan to go with the business line laptops. 









 Okay, so I have practically zero experience on this kind of thing, due to a very small amount of partners in the past. But my girlfriend really loves it, and I want to make it great for her too. I'm pretty bad at it, partly because I feel that my tongue has no strength at all and that I'm not sure what/where it should be doing. It's also pretty short, compared to Caucasian tongues (I'm Asian, and yes, feel free to make all the jokes you want...). Lastly, I don't know what to do about all the hair that's there since I really have to get in there for my tongue to get any access. She keeps it trimmed but it still gets in my mouth sometimes (which I figure is unavoidable). 




 I want to get some Canadian Ice Wine for my girlfriend's family when I visit them (in Ohio) at the end of the month. Is there a place that sells it in the area? I think I would also have luck at a generic fancy wine store in the Boston area. It has to be accessible by public transit though, because I don't have a car and it's too fucking cold to walk. :( 









 I thought my entire life that this was normal, but apparently a lot of people don't suffer from this! Basically when I wake up in the morning (in addition to no cognitive abilities), I have no strength in my hands meaning that I can't even open a bottle of water if I'm thirsty. Can't grip doorknobs, etc. This also happens when I find something really funny or when I get tickled (I also get lightheaded and dizzy from tickling). Can anyone relate to my silly disorder? 




 Those World Cup fan threads have made me wonder: Eastern European women are pretty good looking but many suffer from middle age burnout. Is there an equivalent for our beautiful friends to the south? 




 For example, this reddit submission: http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/bphq8/school_sex_education_about_breast_sizes_what_you/ 




 Or would the universe just implode? 




 In a post-Bush world, I think the American public will be more resistant to these changes. Who or where should the average person go to in order to voice their concerns? Something has to be done about this bullshit theater of security. 









 Seriously. What gives? 






















































 It also helps that Catholicism is rather liberal compared to many other Protestant groups. What would be really surprising is if we see more Protestant churches saying similar things. 




 Why wait when you can do it yourself? http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/surprising-history-powdered-alcohol-180951278/?no-ist 




 Side question: what's the average age for an active Navy Seal? How long are they "under contract" for? I'd imagine that this kind of continuous training isn't very good for you even if you reach 30... 




 I don't smoke marijuana, but I think that prohibition-wise it has to be consistent. If you're going to ban marijuana then drugs that cause equal or higher impairment should be banned. Alcohol is a great example of this. You either ban both, or neither. 




 OP wants a lil cuppa tea afterward 




 It's actually on FOX. 




 First hottest: Olivia Wilde? 




 Southland was great. I loved how they showed how his personality changed over the seasons. Too bad it didn't get a large audience... 









 That was only six days ago? Felt like months.... 




 So, this may sound a little out there, but... you could bring more than one sheet per person to a hot tub...... 




 Shit, I can't do math late at night. I meant 2^x, which is exponential. 




 It's stupid because the number of people you have to study is the number of generations squared. You could study mtDNA and Y, but that is a very small subset. And let's not even get into the whole issue of migratory patterns and population mixing. Sure, you can make general statements about certain groups as a whole (eg. there has been recent studies on Jewish migration out from the Middle East), but to claim geographical pinpoint is absurd and downright misleading.

You can claim where a population as a whole have migrated over time **on average**, but it's another thing to claim something about one person. 




 I mean, they were the first "democracy" but let's be realistic. When you have brawls in the legislature in the 1990s you're setting the bar pretty low. 




 Because it's fucking delicious. 




 I'm as "pro-Ukraine" as most others, but you have to admit... when a building is surrounded, molotoving/torching the place is not a great way to gain sympathy. 




 I think it's likely they'll expand on the MW/BO theme of playing the bad guys for brief portions of the game. I wouldn't be surprised if half the game you play as PMC and half the game was US forces. 




 As an older guy who cannot play multiplayer because he'll get his ass kicked, I've always played for the SP campaigns. They're also a bargain if you wait until they're on sale. Ghosts had a really interesting plotline and gameplay, but the problem was that it was too short. 




 Some part of California is pretty much on fire during the summer. I'm surprised that the state hasn't been more proactive in fighting drought, given all the state money that goes towards fighting these things. 




 I tried out the newer Nokia phones at a Verizon store the other day. As a quick comparison to the other flagships, I would say that in terms of what I most use a phone for (messaging), the keyboards blow away the stock keyboard on the Moto X and is as good if not better than that on the S4/S5. Some people really like the stock Android keyboard but I find it rather difficult to use (I also like the Blackberry Z10 keyboard, so YMMV). The WP interface is nice and fluid, but feels rather barren. Text is way too big for what I need and information is very "not dense". 




 Ghosts actually had a pretty fun SP campaign -- quite a lot of varied gameplay and was setting up a new universe -- but it was too short compared to the other CoD games. I think I finished it in one or two casual sittings. Let's hope this one lasts longer! 




 Apparently for Mark Cuban, it's only "un-American" if you're coercing a "job creator". 




 In recent history Putin has done exactly the opposite of what American analysts said he would do. I think it's pretty safe to say that we can just play The Opposite Game and we would have Putin's complete strategy. 




 And how is that different from prison guards in real life? Do you think guards do not actively play out fantasies where they are in a powerful position, or do not take cues enabling abuse from their superiors?  




 I would be a bit more optimistic and say that's slowly changing now. Especially with the advent of "big data" like in genomics, more and more statisticians are entering biology and demonstrating the use of confounding variables and "cage effects" for animal models. The basic problem was that historically sample sizes were so low that researchers didn't feel the need to or could not filter their datasets against secondary variables. Many were just not trained in these techniques at all, but newer crops of scientists are. 




 The large coffee (20oz?) would then be approximately the same price as a Starbucks Venti. If you're normalizing for caffeine content per dollar then it's not even a contest. If you're in a major Canadian city I don't think you'll have a problem finding a Starbucks or even a local coffee shop with better beverages for similar pricing, but I guess if you're on a road trip then Timmy Ho's might be your only option. 




 Canadian here. Why do people like Timmy Ho's so much? That place is disgusting. The coffee is watered down and sandwiches are basically no better than prepackaged. 




 Where do you put your used floss and other unflushables if you never noticed you had a trashcan in the bathroom? 




 Why not ginger? One of the best anti-nauseants besides marijuana and you're not rotting your teeth. 




 Whatever guys, I loved CoD Ghosts. I bought it heavily discounted, which probably helped. The biggest black mark that I can give against it was that the campaign was too short. It took me 2 days to beat, whereas Splinter Cell Blacklist took me at least 5x longer with a more engaging plot. 




 You make a great point, but it still makes me think about how the American military's logistic machine is basically subsidizing that of its allies. Nations ask the US for logistic support *all the time* and yet they pay very little or nothing for it. Wouldn't it be more fair to create an international force for this (eg. UN-based), or for each country to invest in similar capability, or even allow the US to send another country a bill for services rendered? 














 I think the big difference, like you said, is "focus". For someone who is good on the keyboard, it's way too easy to zone out and just transcribe on a laptop. On the other hand, people write much slower and have to focus and condense before they write. 




 Just wanted to point out that it's okay to show up to a party alone, have a few beers and conversations with a few people, and then politely leave. At least, during my late 20s (I just turned 30) that was perfectly accepted. In college people used to call you lame if you left a party at 10pm. People my age now have jobs and other commitments, and we appreciate that you took the time to even come out for a drink. We also don't hold it against you if you don't show up, so don't feel any pressure to come if you don't want to!

Part of being extroverted is realizing that everyone just wants to feel comfortable and wants their peers to feel the same way. Unless you are with a group of assholes, nobody is judging you. Even strangers are ultimately interested in facilitating a good time, because embarrassment for you is an awkward situation for them. 




 This was my strategy as I turned into a young adult after college (because being an undergrad does NOT count as actual adulthood). When I got older though, "not giving a fuck" got refined to "being carefree". I'm 30 now, and there are a lot of important social cues and lessons that people need to pay attention to and "give a fuck" about. The rest deserve neither sweat nor tears. 




 Google Talk was an awesome lightweight client until it started integrating with Hangouts. It would boot up instantly on my old Gingerbread phone, but now it takes at least 3-4 minutes to even get to a typing stage in Hangouts. Also as the video chat capabilities got better, it started getting more and more flaky -- sound randomly not working, and thrashes the CPU to 100% during a webcam session. Not to mention that it now pops out to a new window for a video chat with no way to pop it back into gmail, meaning that the option to multitask was completely eliminated. 




 You should listen to Dinosaur Jr. They were part of the late 80s/early 90s grunge movement and are still around making great music. 




 I don't think it's as simple as the quantity of oil production. My skin returned to being extremely oily but I don't get the severe nodular kind that I used to have. 




 My skin was dry as fuck when I took accutane for five months for extremely inflammed nodular acne. When I stopped (~4 years ago), my skin returned to being extremely oily. No more acne though, except in recent years but those are just occasional little mild things.

I still had extremely inflammed pustules on my scalp, and a doctor suggested that it might be seborrheic dermatitis. Coal tar and salicylic acid shampoos didn't do anything. I even stopped using hair products for a month. About two months ago I decided to use the "clinical strength" Head and Shoulders with selenium disulfide. Boom. In two days it was completely gone and I haven't had anything since.

So in short, my oily skin did come back, but it appears that something changed about it that prevented the growth of severe acne on my face. 




 What about things like visual programming paradigms like LabVIEW and related platforms? You could make each of those modules secure and follow good standards, and these could be the building bricks for larger applications. 




 I don't think that's the case. The IRS already knows almost everything about you and the eligibility criteria for most tax breaks, so prefilling it would work for 90% of the families that make a salary and do a light bit of investment. 




 It doesn't matter -- if you are a regular Joe that makes a salary, the government already knows how much you make. Your employer also sends out its own W2 records to the US government. For many investments, the government by tax day knows how much money was cashed or moved around before you even submit the form. Even 1099s get submitted to the IRS too, so I'm not even sure why there is even a need for "adjustment" if they mail you a 1040. That should only be in the 1% of cases and even then you'd think the IRS would apply all possible tax breaks to you because *it knows everything about you already and knows all the eligibility criteria for every single tax break*.

It's just inefficiency at its worst. In places like Spain they just mail you a card that says "This is what we think you owe or what we will give you back. If it's correct then don't do anything." 




 Energy and telecom are the two biggest industries to be privatized when I was growing up in Canada. 




 I've had those comments too -- I think that some deodorants probably have a much stronger scent than cologne. 




 I think it really depends on the woman. It's a pretty light fragrance, but some prefer the musky kind. 




 Also, no makeup is infinitely preferable to your face being completely monotone/flat. You need to know how to use the blush/etc otherwise you'll just look like a ghost. 




 Coal plants spread more "radioactively active" isotopes than every nuclear reactor ever made. 




 To be fair, we have no way of knowing what this person does during tax season. For all we know he or she could be getting a big fat refund from the US government. 




 Also, many doctors give out antibiotics prophylactically for those who have a medical history of secondary bacterial infections. 




 The difference is also that it's also infinitely easier to delete an entire directory in Unix by typoing. Most people use File Explorer with Windows.

For me though, it's way easier to accidentally move a lot of files/folders somewhere in Windows. Especially with a flaky trackpad or mouse. 




 I don't think people realized how variable crop yields were before the advent of industrial agriculture and now GMO. Developing countries would literally go into famine in one bad year. And those who advocate intensive farming, most of these farmers also hold second jobs as supplemental income. Intensive farming is hard to implement because they simply don't have the time for it unless you're promoting a perpetual class of farmers. 




 Not to mention that *seed quality* is extremely variable, so no farmer who is worried about year-to-year yield would pile their "natural" seeds together willy-nilly. Not only are farmers paying for resistant seeds, they also pay Monsanto for the QC. 




 That's not quite correct. Even if life elsewhere required oxygen for large organisms, there are a variety of methods to liberate it from existing compounds. 

Personally, I believe that it's very possible that life could be *everywhere* where there is liquid water (because it is polar and conducive to a lot of chemical reactions). The reason is because many planets have energy sources -- whether it be from the sun or from geothermal energy or nuclear heating. Likewise, life was thought to have started from geothermal vents on Earth. I believe that all you really need is a source of energy, water (or any medium to conduct chemical reactions) and the basic elements which are already abundant in the universe, and life will find a way to emerge. You're talking about billions of years, so it's not out of the imagination to think of bacterial organisms with enzymes that break down compounds to make oxygen; which then evolved to much larger ones.

Case in point: how cool would it be to have bacterial organisms that evolved to break down *water* into its constitutive elements? You would create a proton gradient to generate energy, and oxygen for respiration and chemical reactions. Then you can take that evolutionarily in so many directions. 




 This is fucking stupid. What's next? The USA is going to refuse F1 and J1 visas for students/postdocs/visiting professors? Leave politics to politicians. You're unnecessarily punishing scientists and astronauts, people who have exactly zero influence in public policy and have zero clout with regards to events in the Ukraine. 




 It's quite telling (and quite shocking!) when the only complaint about Windows 8 is the UX. Everything else about it is practically perfect. It boots up in seconds. It's fast and stable. There are just so many glaring design issues that make it such a tragic operating system. I use the OS on my primary computer and I have never used a single live tile. I've tried using the Metro apps but they never made any sense to me. 




 So nothing's changed since the 1990s? 




 So basically, the 1990s. 




 How many of their artillery and shells do you think are still functional? How many of them have been properly maintained over the past 60 years? Quality matters over quantity. Similarly how many of their rifles do you think can function in a real firefight? How many of their starving soldiers can actually function as effective infantry? It's probably pretty pathetic. 




 Afghanistan failed to "rebuild" for reasons that North Korea will never face. NK doesn't have rampant tribalism, ridiculously low literacy rates (which is surprisingly high in NK), random acts of terrorism, etc. 




 Definitely check out the related links if you want to get into the weird part of youtube. 




 What the fuck. Sirius black is Gary Oldman?! 




 Then why don't you do just that -- take out a line of credit to pay off your student loan? It's almost stupid not to, considering that the cost of education in Canada (where I grew up and went to college) can be pretty minimal so the size of the line of credit wouldn't even be that big. 




 People who proactively see the doctor about ailments have better health outcomes. This means they effectively reduce the burden on the total system by not waiting until the last minute to go to the ER or until something requires major surgery. If you can pre-emptively treat it at your PCP then you save the government fuck-ton of money.
 




 People who are comparing Iraq and Afghanistan to Crimea are also totally missing the point. Say whatever you want about false pretexes and oil, but economic extraction and occupation are completely different than outright annexation. The United States is not interested in absorbing countries, but would rather use economic hegemony to influence countries. The rhetoric also matters here: Putin is using nationalist language in order to outright turn these countries into *a part of Russia*. This means being subject to Russian laws and (lack of) civil rights including things like freedom of speech. What if you were a Crimean journalist or a gay-rights activist? It might be rare, but let's extrapolate that to Eastern Ukraine or the rest of the Baltics.

The United States allowed Afghanistan and Iraq to form their own constitution, set of laws, and have elections. Sure, they may have had a hand in influencing them but for the most part they left the details of governing to the people there.

This is even worse than during the Cold War, when the US and USSR were setting up puppet states across the world. They were part of respective economic and governmental cooperative spheres, but participating states could by and large do their own thing. What Russia is doing today is much more aggressive regardless of whether he intends for Crimea to be an "autonomous" region or not. It sets a dangerous precedent for the neighboring regions. 




 The whole argument for armed guards everywhere is completely ridiculous. The fact is that the USA is one of the safest places in the world to live. It's the media that's inflating the fear of violent death. Violent crime is typically concentrated in bad neighborhoods and ghettos, where the police are reluctant to do anything useful (for various reasons I won't get into here). Violence also is particularly pronounced for certain ethnic groups. If politicians and the police force were actually serious about saving lives, they would actually direct resources to areas where they would have an impact instead of making a big show out of it. 




 Armed guards will do nothing against terrorism. Remarkably, airports are one of the most safest places on the planet. They are "sanitized" to the point of being slightly disconcerting. If you take a look at how many gun-related incidents (even aggregating for check-in versus boarding area), it is so safe that putting armed guards at every airport is a complete waste of money.

Take the shooting at LAX for instance. What is a better use of money and can save more lives: actually training a better police force and reducing gun deaths in LA proper, where many more people die every day, or putting guards at one of the safest places? 




 The thing that I like most about TJs is that while the produce quality isn't the greatest, the prices are fair compared to other stores. I live in the Bay Area, and buying something as simple as berries can break your bank if it's at some place other than TJs. They may not last as long or be as fresh as Whole Foods, but they are solid for the price you pay. They sell some non-TJ brand stuff there (off the top of my head they sell a particular brand of cold cut meats and also Nature's Path cereal) and these prices are literally *double* of a grocery store that is 5 minutes away by bike. Same with vegetables like tomatoes, asparagus, spinach, etc. I don't need to pay $6 for each of these items, yet when I shop at any other place that's what they will cost. 




 The US invades, but that is very different than outright annexation. 




 Some historical perspective: after WWII, the US was basically last man standing aside from Russia. As the world rebuilt the US was effectively the West's *entire* military arsenal. We were basically taking on the bulk of military spending for Western Europe. This carried on to its present day where American forces are practically subsidizing everyone else's military force.

Nobody is going to "chip in" unless (1) the US significantly reduces its own spending for others to get nervous, or (2) the US signals that it might not defend "friendly" countries. The problem is that nobody seriously thinks that the American military-industrial complex is going anywhere soon, so no country is willing to pay their "fair share".

I hope the Ukrainian situation will shake things up a bit. To me, NATO is basically an American subsidy to another country's defense budget. The reason why American spending is the equivalent of the defense budget of the next 17 countries is that we are basically absorbing the defense budget for countries that "can't afford it" or have decided that other things in their budget are more worthwhile. Therefore it makes a lot of sense for weaker Eastern European countries to join so they won't feel as threatened by Russia. But the US can show a lot of military restraint here, so that these own countries can spend a little bit more to what would be an appropriate contribution to continental defense. 




 The nanodrop is great at getting a rough idea of a sample's concentration. But if you want something more accurate you should look into something like the Qubit by Invitrogen. It can do DNA, RNA, and protein samples too. Many labs use it for next-gen sequencing as it's very sensitive to loading amounts and it's really unparalleled. 




 I used to own an LG Voyager and my gf still uses and env2. Those things are tanks. I complain all the time about how my smartphone is now so laggy, but those things just power through with no lag. Very responsive. Even the shitty web browser didn't freeze half the time on a webpage, which was great for briefly reading the news. I miss those days when you didn't have to wait for anything on a phone. 




 There are also many access programs for people who can't afford the drug -- some are even administered by the drug company themselves. It's not all roses, but intense lobbying by patient advocates in the past 30 years has really improved drug access. 




 Unfortunately, the actual discovery of the drug costs much less than the amount of money dragging it through trials. Sure, most initial ideas for medicines come from NIH grants but it takes a lot more to commercialize it. 




 If you had a time machine, you should move to China! It was crazy back in the day, especially in Beijing. There's still a lot of bicycles now, but many more cars too. 




 LOL @ 6:30 




 Certainly the bulk of the virus is in the Congo/CAR, but for example Nigeria and Ghana are at the tips of the giant hotspot where Ebola and other viruses live. Ghana is actually doing pretty well compared to the rest of Africa, and Nigeria has a growing oil economy and is slated to be the next wave of "BRIC" countries to fight out of poverty. If you look at a map Guinea is much farther west than where Ebola infections typically occur, which is actually very disconcerting.

Generally speaking, many African countries have been enjoying steady growth in the past decade. There are definitely a few that have systemic problems/are a total shitshow, but people are definitely not as pessimistic as in the 1990s. 

Edit: here is a nice quickie http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/01/daily_chart 




 Why? Near the Ebola hotspots there are many countries that are developing very well. In 10 years many of them will be in pretty OK shape -- like South Korea when things were starting to take off.

Edit: not sure why people are downvoting my optimism for the African continent. It's a known fact that many African nations nowadays are doing much better than in the 80s and 90s. http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/01/daily_chart I guess stereotypes about developing the continent die hard... 




 There sure a lot of conspiracy theorists and cynics on reddit who think that the US dominance in the world is somehow without a strong foundation and can come crashing down at any point. Many countries have tried going toe-to-toe economically and have failed, and even more have practically collapsed when the US dipped into a recession.

The "age of American decline" is total horseshit. In fact, the world is disconcertingly getting more and more dependent on the US economy.

As to your point about China: in complete contrast to Russia, which turned into a shitshow grab for power in the collapse of the Soviet Union, China is now run by a bunch of technocrats and a rolling roster of them at the top. Compared to Russia they may both be brutal, but China is prudent and Russia is brash. 




 It's pretty much a guarantee that once Africa fights its way out of poverty (10-30 years from now), Ebola will be a much bigger issue. Hopefully scientists here will have the foresight to spend more on researching it, instead of waiting around like Malaria. 




 There is a lot of talk about Canada's plans to sell their oil to China if the Keystone pipeline doesn't go through. I think there's already talk of them building a pipeline to the Pacific coast to ship oil there. I think that China would prefer to buy from Canada, considering they tend to stay out of most countries' affairs and Russia is not exactly economically stable. That and there are huge amounts of Chinese financial interest in Canada in the form of real estate and stakes in other natural resource companies. 




 I don't think P2P streaming video would ever work except for the most popular videos -- the ridiculous upload throttles set by ISPs basically ensure that there will never be enough bandwidth to go around. It will never scale up. On the other hand, the distribution infrastructure doesn't suffer from this problem. 




 Something I've always wondered about tamago: if it's truly made like how it is in the video, how does the first part of the tamago (which is in the middle by the end of the clip) not be completely overcooked by the time the brick is finished? 




 I'm not even sure that it's catering to fans at this point. Marvel has created lots of *new* superhero moviegoers in the past few years. Captain America was never really an A-list comic book hero, either. I think Marvel's just very good at making good movies, despite the fact that every large studio on the planet is absolutely terrible at it when they are given a large amount of content control. 









 In fact, I think the only Asians to eat things off a plate with a chopstick are probably Koreans and Japanese. It's starting to move into Chinese culture but it's still very awkward to eat food without a bowl. Even SE Asia use forks and spoons because of their colonized past. 




 Whaaaat? 5:1?! I have cooked long and short grain rice all my life -- in a stovetop and in a rice cooker -- and I have never used as much as 5:1. You might be setting your heat up too high if you need that much water. Long grain rice is perfect at around 2:1 or even slightly lower if you like it firm. 




 Most of the other European countries are all talk at this point. They are desperate for Russian gas and are terrified of their economy. But Merkel knows Germany can hold its own and actually has some balls to throw some sanctions and tough words to Russia. Germany and Russia can have an economic fistfight and it wouldn't even be fair, as the former has a diverse and healthy economic foundation while the latter constantly flirts with disaster. 




 I think some world governments had a pretty good clue of where to look but were holding back their capability to give the Malaysians a chance to sort it out themselves. 




 Not in the same timeline though, so I don't think it counts! 




 I think they got the tone of ASM right. He was playing a high school kid, so that means a part of their target audience would be young teenagers too. The movies grow up with the target audience. I feel like the Harry Potter movies really did this right, but obviously they're not going to make 7 Spider Man movies in the same timeline. 




 Are you kidding me? I guess that's worse than one that I've heard recently: many CS grads can't code a basic main() function in C++. 




 I don't understand what Putin was thinking. In the medium to long term, it was likely that Crimea would anyway separate from Ukraine after the "revolution". There were a million other things he could have done besides send in troops and hold a snap referendum that wouldn't result in alienating everyone. 




 Check out Biomatrica. 




 But why aren't there more "processed green vegetable" foods? There is some nutrient loss, but not a whole lot when you are looking at what you get versus eating hamburgers and fries all day. The only ones I can think of are veggie chips and smoothie drinks, but not many more. 




 Atheist here, but just want to chime in: I think it's pretty clear from the quote in the parent comment that "just and perfect" should be interpreted in a metaphysical sense. Life on Earth is flawed, but the afterlife in heaven is where these ideal characteristics are manifested and can be experienced. 




 The Aussie radar system is pretty damn good too. I'd be wagering that Western intelligence is already analyzing what happened on their own, especially since there could have been a terror/national security element to the disappearance. 




 It's not WWII. A war with Russia will be over very quickly. The Russian military has declined dramatically since the Cold War, while American spending has risen. If we are speaking solely on conventional warfare, you have 20+ countries fighting one. If the ME starts to get involved (Syria's hands are tied at the moment), you have basically Israel and Saudi Arabia versus Iran. Neither of these are anywhere near fair fights and all of the countries who will be on the receiving end of a beatdown know that.
 




 People are appalled at why the USA is so cozy with Saudi Arabia, but the fact is that they were probably the most important, if not the only, factor that led to the collapse of the USSR. The US will never forget that -- for better or worse they will be bros for a long period of time. 




 Russia isn't the USSR or any kind of other rogue state. If its economy collapses the government will lose popular support. Russians will be smart enough to see that war will not fix an economy. They saw that 25 years ago and many people are still alive from that era. The only reason Putin still gets any kind of popular support with Ukraine is because they are still "doing okay" economically, but citizens will turn on their leaders when that disappears regardless of how strong the military is. Millions of Russians and Eastern Europeans died in WWII and the Cold War, so they are not eager for a larger conflict. 




 I don't think you understand how cell phones work. They are not satellite phones. They communicate with a tower on the ground. A phone the size of your hand doesn't have enough power to transmit to a cell phone tower 30000ft (almost 10 miles) away, especially when towers can be optimized to transmit horizontally instead of vertically. 




 See the comment in this thread. Why is this chain of thought (toxin for bugs means we shouldn't be eating it!!) so prevalent? There are so many cases where certain foods or molecules are terrible for one species but fine for humans. One great example is that dogs will die if you give them chocolate, but the only effect it has on humans is getting fat. 




 Not to mention people think hitting the delete button on your hard drive actually erases something. 




 Gonna get downvoted to hell for saying this, but I couldn't watch Community anymore because of the same reason. All of the characters became these crazy caricatures that were only funny because they were caricatures. The jokes weren't even very funny anymore -- it was just being quirky for the sake of it. Case in point: the recent youtube video of the Dean rapping in the opening scene. It's only funny because it's random and unexpected, not because of any actual situational humor. 




 Cuddling. 




 Where did you buy your coffee? I live in the bay area and I can't even think of a place that charges that much for drip or espresso. The most expensive off the top of my head is Philz Coffee, which is like $2.50 for a small cup of drip. 




 Holy fuck, they are actually doing this? I wish I could upvote all the people who are on board with that plan. Screwing with Russia's oil and gas economy is the best non-violent way to deal with them. The US finally is showing their economic muscle and balls, unlike Europe who is in the short term unwilling to fight with Russia because of gas. 
























 Can't you just download the APK and install it on an Android phone/tablet? I'm sure the package is floating around somewhere. 




 I don't think the issue is really with Iraq, but rather the spillover caused by major fuckups on all sides in Syria. ISIS would never have existed/broken away from AQ if the Syrian conflict would have been resolved quickly. 




 Here's another morsel for thought: Hong Kong has massive demonstrations every year (especially on Tiananmen), but China lets them do it. Do you really think they would even try to stop them in 30 years when the "50 year limit" is up? Massive demonstrations would ensue and the Chinese government will lose its legitimacy. 




 I don't think this really matters in the long term. Hong Kong's cultural identity is independence. You'd have to kill off generations of native Hong Kongers for them to lose it. Even migrant workers move there because of the opportunity and because it's "not China". The second they try to erase that from Hong Kong is the moment they lose legitimacy in the eyes of the people. You'll see mass demonstrations and civil unrest, which the Chinese government does not want and would not be able to control in the mass media.

Simply put, China is deathly allergic to civil unrest, and there is no way to completely impose Communist rule without creating utter chaos in the region. 




 Stimulating the immune system is going to be one of the big things in the coming years.

Here's an amazing result presented at ASCO with pembrolizumab, which helps to re-activate the immunity-based antitumor system: http://www.ascopost.com/ViewNews.aspx?nid=16291. My impression is that these types of drugs are probably broadly applicable and could become standard of care for all patients. 




 I think it really depends on what Boehner's (and the future whip's) goals are -- whether it is to maintain establishment control of the House or to win the national election. The facts are that many primary challenges from the Tea Party already come from solid Republican states that would not affect the result of the national election. However, moderate reforms like immigration overhaul can be forced through an non-election year like 2015 while maintaining the Hastert rule. These types of actions can pull many of the slightly left-leaning purple states back into play. Even though Democrats are going to get pummeled in 2014, they currently have a massive structural advantage in winning the national election (with or without Clinton). The establishment Republicans know this, and the question is whether they are willing to sacrifice a significant amount of house seats in order to survive nationally.

Personally, I don't think Boehner or any high-level politician really gives a shit about some random House member who is afraid of actually having to campaign hard for their seat. What they might anticipate is that by passing bills that are more moderate, they can also win House seats in purple districts to buffer any new Tea Party members that may get elected. It would come out even in the end, and the Republican Party would have a net gain in their White House chances. 




 My bet is that Boehner is going to be more aggressive about pushing his (more moderate) agenda after the 2014 midterms. The impression I got was that he was worried about Cantor taking his job, but with him gone there is nobody else in the House that could possibly challenge him for Speaker. 




 Why would Democrats do that? It's not like picking up seats in the House will mean anything this cycle. 




 I'm sure that the "establishment Republicans" are shitting their pants right now after winning several primaries a few weeks ago. Boehner must be pretty happy, though. 




 It's a completely different medium though. Storytelling in Hollywood has to be done in between 2-3 hours, whereas shows like GoT and True Detective have 10 hours in a single season. 




 The issue is that for decades (even in the 90s and 2000s!), a college degree statistically led to much higher future incomes -- much more so than a 2-year or vocation. The problem is that the recession in the late 2000s caused an unemployment shock, and created scars in companies where they are less likely to take someone who is "green". The student loan thing was never a problem given a decent job, but wage stagnation coupled with reticient hiring has made the problem really bad. 




 You should qualify that statement with: good schools without significant financial aid.

There are many elite schools that pile on the aid in terms of housing and tuition. Princeton undergrad is free. Harvard is free if your family makes less than 80k, and then it's a VERY modest percentage of family income. On the flip side, there are plenty of elite liberal arts colleges and public universities that don't have competitive financial aid packages, and that's where you will see increasing numbers of rich folk (because everyone else can't afford it). 




 The Canadian government has said it will announce new plans for a more focused and effective pilot program for immigrant investors in the coming months.

Let's hold our judgment until we see this. 




 Did the judges taste it? 




 There are a lot of oral insulin therapies currently in clinical trials. Many of them have tags (peptide or chemical) that are attached to recombinant insulin. I'd say that is more of a solvable problem than making a pill. 




 The only problem is that seeding guts with genetically modified bacteria has never been done and is probably going to have a hard time at the FDA. Theoretically you could functionally cure type I diabetes by engineering E. coli to express recombinant insulin with specific molecular triggers (eg. some kind of sugar alcohol or drug inducer) and have it live in the gut. Many types of insulin on the market today are recombinant, so it's not a matter of capability -- it's a matter of the FDA flipping its shit when you produce a "living medicine". 




 People are way too religious on filmmakers and screenwriters. There are only a select few who consistently make great movies. Having a change of staff before a single thing has been filmed will not ruin the movie. 




 Likewise, I'm reserving my judgment until the movie actually comes out. Marvel has a great track record, and it could be that the original Ant-Man script actually sucked. Everyone's willing to jump down Marvel's throat but it's not that directors or screenwriters have a 100% record either. 




 I think people wouldn't mind if reasonable and effective security measures were implemented by highly trained professionals. The problem is that most institutions in this country work on the "lowest common denominator" principle, which means they will do the worst type of work they can get away with (in this case, billions of dollars). 




 It's stupid because these school administrators are all about eliminating any kind of liability, and yet in the process of doing so they cause a child to get a sunburn which they are liable for because they banned sunscreen. Imagine if the child were even more light-skinned and got a blistering burn. 




 Too bad she's been completely absent in the season post Purple Wedding... 




 I wouldn't even recommend seeing that movie on DVD. Honestly, there was no plot and maybe 20 minutes of monster battles. 




 Can't you carry some liquid energy with you to sip on at mile 20? Or is that considered cheating? 




 Will this have feature parity with Android devices? I hope they have a Gmail, Maps, and Hangouts replacement. 




 Her acting's been really off the entire season (and maybe the past one too). It just seems like she's phoning it in, compared to the other actors on the show. 




 Intermittent fasting is actually what they called it in the article! Apparently it's really good for establishing portion self-control. 




 Jack will never die. If ratings/ad revenue are good then they will always hold the option of making another season. 




 Does anyone else think that she looks like a female version of Odo? 




 The question is, do YOU feel like you're settling if the guy isn't perfect looking? If you do, then you're setting some impossible standards for yourself and your future partners. I'm far from perfect looking, but do I ever think that my long-term girlfriend/fiance is settling for me? Of course not, and I too never feel like I'm settling for her. You would develop serious trust and insecurity issues if you carry this mentality with you. Relationships are not pie charts, checklists, points systems, zero-sum games, or pro/con tallies of traits -- your partner is one person that you have to consider as a whole in their entirety. 




 It was surprisingly not a terrible movie! It was a solidly mediocre action flick. Highly recommended. 




 I'm a scientist, and starting to dabble a bit in Python. My background is in MATLAB, which is not exactly fast. I was surprised at how *slow* Python was, given that tons of scientists recommend it! 




 There was an article recently in the NYT that showed a new method of "dieting" where you basically "fast" every second day. One day you eat normally, and the second day you basically just skip breakfast and have a small lunch. People who were put on that regimen were able to keep on it longer, and they actually ate less on their normal days! Those people said that they got used a larger "range" of what hunger felt like, so small pangs no longer lead to binge eating. 




 When Starbucks came out with their blonde roast that was the joke of the day for the whole year! 




 Here is the magical coffee maker that will beat anything you get out of a college coffee shop: http://www.amazon.com/Melitta-Ready-Single-Coffee-Brewer/dp/B0014CVEH6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1401696468 sr=8-1 keywords=melitta+coffee+cone

Buy a large airtight mason jar and store your coffee in a cool dark place. Get some nice beans and pregrind them to a "Melitta" grain size, which is very fine. You might think I'm crazy for suggesting pre-grind, but the fact is that (a) you will be going through the beans quickly, and (b) any decent grinder you buy will be very expensive and won't match an industrial grinder's evenness or quality. I have never noticed any difference in quality from preground beans that were stored for a few weeks.

Get a water kettle and a measuring spoon. Tailor the amount of grounds you add in to your taste. I usually do 3 tbsp for a cup of coffee. You'll need the #2 filters from Trader Joe's.

Edit: also, don't get a porcelain coffee cone unless you like wasting your time heating it up. 




 Disagree on the French press. It makes the flavors and textures all muddled. If you want clean distinctive flavors, you should go with the pourover method. It's basically drip coffee, yes, but the advantage is that you have complete control over the flow rate and temperature. The reason why autodrips make awful coffee is that the water never gets hot enough. 




 I think the problem is that bagels get stale way faster than other bread products. Loaves of bread can last a long time, but two days is probably the maximum for bagels.

Edit: that said, you'd probably have an easier time if you turned them into bagel chips! 




 It's a comic book (movie). They can retcon or futcon anything. They do it in the comic books all the goddamn time. 




 Do you think it's genetic or from upbringing? I know lots of toddlers/kids who are picky eaters, but there are some who will eat (and enjoy!) anything. 




 Many crops that you eat today are the product of UV/gamma ray mutagenesis. This never occurred in nature either.

Similarly, a lot of popular fruits were made by grafting plants on each other. That never occurs in nature.

The fact of the matter is that practically 100% of the food that we eat has been changed so much by humans that you wouldn't even be able to recognize their ancestral forms -- even if you go back several hundred years. 




 You forget corn. Its ancestral forms were so WTF that I'm surprised Native Americans kept it around for that long.

In terms of modern (eg. 20th century) science, people "created" new strains by mutagenesis. They would literally bombard crops with UV/gamma radiation, plant them in fields exposed to the environment, and see what came out. For those who are worried about health and environmental concerns, this is far more risky. But of course, the USDA approved these foods rather than the FDA. For some reason, whole-scale genetic changes are OK but changing/inserting several genes is not.

We have the power of hindsight to show that broad-scale/coarse mutagenesis methods are safe. Nobody ever seriously thought that this would be dangerous to the public. While the safety concern in GMO food is strain-specific, we should treat it with appropriate and proportional scrutiny, not hysteria. 




 Usually you don't have to pay a dime for these kinds of lawsuits. You're suing for damages + lawyer fees. 




 Pro-tip: apparently Brita filters can turn shitty vodka into pretty decent ones. 




 It can definitely fit. You just have to squeeze the sandwich harder. Most of the vertical space is the vegetables and the bun. The patty itself isn't any thicker than a regular steak after it's been cooked. 




 Really? That seems like a lot of water for a quick steam... 




 I love the way he explains everything: "You gotta put butter on the bun because it's shit without it." No BS. It just tastes good. 




 For sure! I was in a pretty tough program in undergrad, and we always had group homework sessions. It's a waste of time to do homework by yourself when you can ask your peers/TAs for help. Most professors are very supportive of this because it encourages collaborative learning, but keep in mind that working together could easily lead to copying assignments -- and most students succumb to the latter even with the best intentions. It will bite them in the ass eventually but they do it anyway. 




 Also, do your homework. It's amazing how your exam grades improve when you don't have to learn everything the night before.  




 This is why I hate "showy" cakes like this one, because I'll have to pick off all the fondant before I can even get a decent bite of cake! 




 Where at? I might have to move to NYC now. 




 I know right? "Why are you talking to me? Can't you see I'm eating a sandwich?" 




 IMO, it wasn't even worth the $8.50 student discount price that I paid. Godzilla was on the screen for maybe 15 minutes, and the other monsters just flew around and didn't do shit. Not to mention the huge plot-holes. I could forgive all that if there were lots of monster-Godzilla fights, but most of the time it just cut away to another scene! Especially during the Hawaii scene when they first start fighting! WTF was that? It just cut to the next day and the MUTO had ran off with no explanation!

Pacific Rim I could forgive, because it was exactly what I expected. Godzilla had no plot and no action. 




 That's amazing. As a cyclist in the Bay Area, I'm so happy that cyclists were one of their test cases. There are just too many drivers here that don't pay attention! 




 THANK YOU. Godzilla was awful. I saw it last week and couldn't believe the gushing comments on the official Reddit discussion thread. 




 Jack Reacher was pretty much the best mediocre "serious" action movie. Usually the ones without comedy take themselves too seriously, but this movie hit all the right notes. 




 Yeah, there are plenty of American cities with an extremely high proportion of attractive people. Just go to the cities with a lower average age, eg. places with young professionals and students. Places like SF, LA, San Diego, Seattle, Portland, Boston, NYC, Chicago, Phoenix, Miami... this is also where over 50% of the country live too! 









 What? I've only heard it being called P N A S. The only ones who pronounce it wrong were the non-academics... 




 Does anyone know if these birds can see the infrared beam that comes out of the motion sensor? If they could then it's a little less impressive. 




 I think I'm probably the only guy on Reddit who buys CoD solely for the campaign. At 30 years old, I don't have the time nor skills to go gun-to-gun with teenagers on the internet. I happen to think that the campaigns have been getting steadily better too! The only exception would be Ghosts -- that campaign was excellent, but was just way too short. 




 Yes, very sharp edges can cause damage without you feeling it. Once I cut my thumb pretty deep with a razor blade but didn't notice anything until my hand was covered with blood. 




 Dad joke or not, that one was pretty good. 




 Actually, IF could be easily done if you eat dinner at 6pm and go to bed at midnight. That's automatically 14 hours. If you skip breakfast, you've already done ~18. 




 There's an article on NYT that says that long-term intermittent fasting (eg. eating way less every other day) is more sustainable versus dieting. Apparently it also mentally trains you to fight against hunger signals too, so you start to eat less on your normal days. 




 If you are a scientist, Wolfram Alpha saves you a lot of time by doing unit conversions automatically! 




 Easily One Hour Photo or Insomnia. 




 Holy fuck, that sounds amazing!!! 




 Lack? I don't think a doener kebab done in the German style exists in North America! I've searched far and wide and found nothing. 




 In addition to the neat drugs coming out (especially imatinib for CML comes to mind), cancer can be curative if it is caught very early and is in an organ amenable to surgery. If you can take it out before it metastasizes, in many cases the cancer is eliminated. Things like early stage colorectal cancer comes to mind (get your screenings done!). 




 The stupid thing was that the new Google Maps was not "feature complete" until much later. Off the top of my head I can't think of anything new in Google Maps that blows the old one out of the water. Take Google Hangouts too, for example. In most cases it is 99% the same as Google Talk. It took them over a year to even get any kind of reasonable unified messaging going on. The first few versions were so goddamn slow for no reason. Now they finally have a version that works better but drains battery life. It's as if they can't help but break the wheel. 




 What features? The old Google Maps had 99% of the ones that you needed. Some are completely useless, like the timeshifting frame when you're looking at public transit schedules. That thing is a goddamn UX nightmare, but on the old version it was perfect. 




 A friend of mine dated this guy for a while who only wanted to date/sleep with virgins, and (no joke) found anyone who didn't fit that "standard" to be disgusting. It wasn't a religious thing either -- he was just some white dude going to a pretty good law school to give you an idea to his age. I guess there are no limits to assholery. 




 Probably overkill, but when I work with RNA I always open up a new box of tips. 




 January Jones was also in that Liam Neeson movie I think. Totally ruined it. 




 If they added in a tiny laser diode and buttons for slide advancement, this thing would sell like hotcakes to the business crowd. 




 How would that work? Aren't the old covers made for a smaller screen? 




 I think part of their strategy now is to iterate quickly and accordingly make small batches of the units so they won't run into a Surface 1 debacle. Sell them at a loss/break even but refresh them quickly to keep up with the tech news cycle and build up to what consumers want. Honestly, by doing this they get a lot of goodwill from the tech crowd. It shows that they are actually listening to complaints and addressing them in later releases. 




 Actually, I don't think an i7 1080p+ laptop with 8GB RAM and 512GB SSD would even be priced at $1949. This is very competitive pricing from Microsoft, although I wish they would throw in the type cover as a bundle if you buy them together. 




 Here's a related question: why are you buying the SP3 as a basic office/netflix machine when an Atom powered Windows tablet does exactly the same thing? 




 I just found out they are moving out of their Stanford location... WTF 




 Postdoc and former TA here. We don't give a shit if you are late with your homework or assignments, but we will be offended if you are dishonest about it. 




 Wow, nice! There are a lot of things that Excel can do that are a huge pain in the ass for python. This is speaking as a guy who lives and breathes MATLAB. Excel is excellent for a lot of edge cases, and having that crosstalk is another nice tool in the box.'

Edit: $99 :( 




 The other last thing under his governorship was to have an open primary system! 




 Holy shit, that's video was practically pre-youtube... I didn't know that was WKUK! 









 If FODMAPs are really the culprit, then it really begs the question of whether the specific cause is of microbial imbalance. After all, histology on Celiac-negative patients show no obvious signs of a physiological response, so the only thing that would cause gastrointestinal upset would be the microflora. 




 Once you're finished with that, check out The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, and then The Philadelphia Chromosome. 




 Umm.... plastic is organic too. Dead dinosaurs and oil. 









 At this time last year or even two years ago, getting 1000 comments on a thread was a *huge* deal. Now we see regular AskReddit threads going into the 5-10k range. 




 I think this is something that PIs should advertise too, especially if they have a very comfortable pad of money that they are sitting on. Many graduate students and postdocs generally will have never heard of any given professor, but they are more likely to work for someone if funding is stable and they have the spending freedom to do something ambitious! 




 I mean, besides having superheroes, how are any of the Iron Man movies similar to Thor? or to Captain America? These are the three "solo" franchises that Marvel is actively producing, and they are very different films. 




 Marvel also had the great idea of tying all their disparate superhero franchises together, and added teaser trailers to the end of each movie. What ends up happening is that you get a great sense of cohesion, even though these movies are nothing alike. 




 Have you seen the trailer for Constantine? It looks like a pile of shit. Probably cancelled before the end of the season. 




 Have you seen the trailer for the Constantine TV show? What the fuck is that. 




 Or, you know, they could have graduated already. 




 My favorite example was how imatinib (Gleevec) was invented. The hurdle wasn't due to a lack of knowledge -- we knew the structure of the site to target -- but rather the most difficult part was to convince Novartis to take the risk with a Phase I clinical trial. What we really lack is the capability to test the effectiveness of drugs in vivo on a massive scale. There are tons of molecules where we see a significant "biological" effect, but we have no way to screen for their bioavailability or in vivo effects without going into an animal model. 




 With regards to nutrition, I think you are perpetuating a myth that we "don't have a handle" on it. It is quite the contrary -- we know the vast majority of risky lifestyles that substantially reduce lifespan and increase death rate. The medical literature is quite conclusive and is muddied by fad diets and lifestyles, The rest regarding antioxidants and vitamins, are indeed "dotting the is and crossing the ts" so to speak. The factors with the largest effect size and statistical significance have been solved for decades. 




 I think the outcome depends on the restaurant. Certainly this law wouldn't make a difference for downscale places where tips aren't gratuitous. However this would effectively reduce the number of people who would want to work at a high-end restaurant, because the obscene tips effectively bumps them up to a higher pay grade. What is eventually going to happen is that the high-end restaurant itself is going to have to start offering higher wages in order to attract staff, which means higher upfront prices on the menu.

Personally, I think it all comes out even, but the major difference in the previous case is that the tips all go to the service staff anyway (and maybe people behind the scenes too) -- that kind of income is often protected against the business owner. In this new case, the restaurant pockets the increase in prices and doles out what would be the lowest effective wage that the high-end restaurant labor market would bear. In this scenario, there's a chance that business owners can end up making a nice chunk of money and screwing the staff because there's no such thing as a food service sector union to negotiate fair wages. 




 Your friend is missing a crucial point though -- you can't make blanket statements about medicines, since their mechanisms of action are so disparate. You have salicylic acid and artemesinin, two plant-derived drugs that are first-line use, but you also have a ton of other plant-derived molecules that can't be used in people without significant modification. These kinds of generalized statements about drugs and medicines are unfortunately convenient because they don't require much critical thought, but the fact is that you have to look at everything on a case by case basis. 

Add onto that the **type of knowledge** that we have is very different today then it was back then. There's still a lot to be discovered and a lot of uncertainty, but it is not in the same areas as 50-400 years ago. We are capable of more critical thinking today than in the entire history of civilization, so it's not useful at all to generalize. 




 Doubt it. The reason why drugs in the first half of the 20th century was that people knew very little about organic chemistry and how drugs interacted with the body. We're in the age of molecular medicine, so many drugs that are discovered today will probably stick around for a long time. What we are lacking today is very different from back then. Today, drug development is more of a lack of capability than a lack of knowledge.  




 Seriously. At 7' tall you could load the tallest chromatography column in the world without breaking a sweat. 




 Yale might not have been a bad choice if the kid wasn't really into ball. All of the elite colleges give significant financial aid or are free anyway. With Stanford you'd be practicing all the time, but Yale would give him more free time. 




 Seriously. Stanford would be the perfect balance for him. 




 No shit. He just has to keep up his grades and apply to Stanford. Great basketball team and stellar education. 




 How the fuck can Applebees be better than Red Robin? That's not even possible. 




 Al Madrigal is easily the funniest of the correspondents, but Larry Wilmore is pretty good.  




 Have you tried ATCC? 
























 The Euro is at historically weak levels (not exchange rate-wise, but credit and solvency) due to some boneheaded decisions made by several countries in the Euro zone. They're not going to move to the yen, so in fact this will make the USD even stronger than before. 




 Spying is a little like masturbation, everyone does it but you might want to seek help if you're doing it constantly.  




 Maybe it's because the US knows as soon as Iran gets a nuclear warhead, suddenly Israel will be like "AHA! Look at all the nukes that we have too!" The two governments are total shitheads, so they will for sure escalate as close as they can to war if not actually into one. I'd like to give the US some credit and say that the cat is already out of the bag for Israel's nukes, so they're just trying to prevent it from getting out of control in the region. 




 what's wrong with terminator seeds? they are ecologically superior if you're an environmentalist, and most farmers buy seeds every season anyway. 




 digikey 




 Great explanation. China's banks are fundamentally capitalist too - why would they buy debt that nobody wants or is of uncertain quality in the medium to long term? They already have enough on their plate managing the debt bubble in their own country.  




 Inability to export these Russian assets will be their Achilles heel. It's really hard to shut down oil and gas wells, so if they have not enough people to sell to then they will have excess supply problems.  




 Do you think that Russia could make up the difference lost from sanctions through rising gas prices and diverting exports to places like China? That's a pretty tall order. Fortunately, as Russia participates pretty strongly in the world economy I am optimistic that sanctions will have a huge effect in the medium term. But it will be several years before Russia feels the pinch.  




 It's just kind of odd that if having refuge is essential, why didn't Monsanto/other GMO companies just spike it in themselves from the beginning? That way farmers can't cut corners. 




 Also, how could you even make a good plot with a character like Deadpool? There would be absolutely no suspense or character development. 




 Seriously, I don't think people understand that the only reason why the USSR lasted so long was because it heavily relied on stealing resources from its satellite states in the eastern bloc and beyond. Russia seems strong in the short term, but they would get economically curb stomped in the next 5-10 year range. 




 How much of that death rate do you think is due to disparities in health care infrastructure? What happens if someone in a Western country got infected with it? 




 Christianity is the same way -- there are large numbers of small Christian "sects" in America that disagree vehemently with Catholicism and many of the major Protestant groups. 




 It depends though. Lots of supermarkets have shitty tasteless ones that aren't even ripe. 




 Are they still good if you throw them into some (pre-cooked) oatmeal? Like would I break my teeth? 




 Donut/Saturn peaches are kind of odd though -- they get mushy incredibly fast and then they get way too sweet to eat. 




 I turned 30 a few months back, and still feel pretty young. Granted, I have a long-term girlfriend and we're probably going to get married in the near future, but seeing my college friends get married a few years back and popping out kids is kind of unnerving. 




 Also, if you read the article it says that the store revenue increased by only 2% but yet net income doubled because he fired everyone. That's always the first thing that anyone, especially if they work in finance, will do as a reflex but the question is does he have a long-term growth strategy? 2% increase in sales is pitiful if you consider that other chains (eg. fast casuals like Chipotle) are growing like gangbusters. 









 Did you even try to Google it?

 I don't have a good link for this, but on the PBS Nature series they specifically show a type of crow that collects tools. 




 To be fair, there are also many examples of de novo resistance, eg. point mutations in the target site (I think rifampicin is an example).  




 there was a lab working on it in California. I heard they lost NIH funding and had to scrap the project.  




 Fun fact: there is a lizard in the California/Southwest region that is also a target of ticks. But the lizards have something in the blood that eradicates the bacteria that cause Lyme disease and helps fight its spread in the region! 




 I think people don't really understand what this means and where antibiotics come from. The vast majority of antibiotics and drugs are derived from Streptomyces/Actinobacteria, who excrete these naturally. Most of these bacteria express the resistance gene in tandem so that they don't die while they are producing it. Therefore in most cases a resistance gene *by definition* will exist. These can get passed by horizontal gene transfer (eg. phage or plasmid). 




 Also, generally people who have type 2 diabetes are older folk who are prone to being stubborn about lifestyle changes. 




 I think that ~50 billion would probably be enough to give every single HIV+ person on the planet ART for free for the rest of their lives. Do this for along with promoting safe sex and you'll probably have a good shot of eradicating it in ~50 years. 




 Honestly -- just bring up some clips of the show on Youtube. It is an awful, cheesy, superficial but fun mess and I don't know why people are expecting anything different. 




 I'm 30, thought the trailer looked great! 




 There were already multiple gulf war conflicts before 2003. Was the point then to finish up some loose ends or to deals with a "WMD" problem? Nobody was ever honest about it, and even if they indeed had them, invading should have been the last thing on the table instead of the first.  




 Interpret this how you will because there are a lot of sides to this, but in WWII the standing policy was to bomb to rubble every German city over 100k in population. The eastern European front was equally bad. Major cities in Japan suffered the same fate. Most people don't talk about itin the USA, but if you go to even a tiny German town there will usually be some kind of memorial or exhibit showing how they painstakingly rebuilt literally everything brick by brick.  




 I don't know... it's kind of fun but it just makes everything taste sweet rather than flipping flavors around. 




 Actually, it's pretty accepted that there is a strong genetic component to pair bonding in humans: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK97287/ is a brief snippet (a bit old). 




 Those Camrys... they will literally last you a quarter of your life. 




 Russia may be an oligarchy, but the moment that Putin tries to "nationalize" the industries is the day there will be a coup. Putin's legitimacy is solely based on a social contract between him/oligarchs and him/Russian citizens. If he can't deliver on the jobs or money and tries to take it for himself, the entire country will turn into a shitshow. 




 The cheese on the pizza can get pretty nasty of you leave it out for too long.  




 Also, China isn't an idiot. They can see that Russia has huge long term problems as compared to the rest of the West.  




 Exactly right. It's like if there was a science scandal and everyone saying "well, I guess I'm going to try homeopathy now." 




 well for one thing, you can actually avoid shooting at civilians instead of bombing a whole building.  




 They probably have enough capital to start some new factories by now.  




 Easy -- the life would be highly divergent than anything we have seen on our planet. Even through the panspermia theory, the genome sequences would still be really different than anything that exists on Earth. All organisms on life are generally well conserved in terms of the essential genes, so you would just compare these elements. 




 Another great reference is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catching_Fire:_How_Cooking_Made_Us_Human by Richard Wrangham.

 They are already taking off, but not in the ways you expect. they are doing well in business applications that require record tracking. or even in things like boarding passes.  




 It won't really solve it, but at least the "new states" from which SoCal is stealing water could at least extract revenues. At this point they don't even have good negotiating power but the tables could turn if each of these "states" were given equivalent powers as every other American state. 




 I'm not totally familiar with the situation and how the proposed state lines are drawn, but there has been a lot of bad history with regards to SoCal/LA and water rights. Entire communities have been destroyed because of water being diverted to LA. 




 How the fuck is this kind of statement upvoted? Most Jewish people, especially in the USA where 40% of Jewish people live, are not religious zealots (ie. "the chosen"). 




 Squab is fucking delicious. Better than duck! 




 Generally, the order is Farmers Market  Garden  Canned  Store. Why is the market one better than your backyard garden? Because they know how to grow the tomatoes properly and not in a tiny patch of dirt without proper nutrition or fertilizer. Also the sunlight is probably better in a field. 




 I feel that once you get up to the $15-40 range, then the actual variety of grape starts to come out a lot more. There's a lot of diminishing gains after that and you'd just be paying for the scarcity (eg. made in small batches) and high costs due to lack of scale. 




 I agree- the important data is not one number but the general trend.  in this case it would be important to look at the dose response curve.  




 Godzilla. What the fuck was that. He's on screen for maybe 20 minutes. His first fight with the MUTO in Hawaii cuts half way through and all of a sudden they are going to SF.  




 I love the jersey cotton sheets from Target. A lot of times the "high thread count" doesn't really mean anything since the "regulations" on that are incredibly lax. 




 Given that this guy has written a review with such a provocative perspective, it's likely that he currently has a lot of promising data that supports this hypothesis and will publish shortly. I just browsed his CV and he's definitely not an academic lightweight. 




 It's so stupid, because the police should know that they are only maximizing their risk to their own lives by entering with guns blazing! 




 People like to generalize way too much about what people should do with their hair. People have greasy or dry scalps all because of genetics. Sure, the shampooing matters but I think the important thing is to do things that your body is comfortable with. For me, I had the itchiest greasiest scalp. I would be breaking out with huge pustles on my head. People were telling me left and right to use this "natural" shampoo, to shampoo it twice a day, to not at all. What ended up working for me after literally 15 years of greasy head was Selenium Disulfide. In Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength. After that, I decided that whatever people told me to do was bullshit and if it wasn't working to try something else until it got better. 




 Bingo! Philanthropists don't give their money away for free. They want organizations to be able to match it with their own fundraising. That shows that the people on the receiving end are competent. 




 I'm not sure how it's counted in HIV, but in cancer, generally "cured" means you died of something else other than cancer. 




 My two older sisters are almost exactly one year apart in age. I try not to think about it. 




 Should have seen the look of anger on the guy's face. There were literally no defenders back there when Brazil scored. 




 Given the state of proteomics technology (with regards to sensitivity and specificity), I would take any results about "number of genes" with a grain of salt. You're naturally going to miss (a) rarely expressed genes, and (b) small proteins that will be lost during the prep. Shockingly I haven't seen many studies done that try to map proteomic data with transcriptomes (eg. you could make libraries with promoter bashing and do an analogous thing with RBS) to figure out the detection response as a function of gene expression. 




 GRRM also said that the TV show will never be exactly the same as the book. He's also happy with the way the show turned out. Let's face it -- TV canon and book canon will become different things, and that's not a bad thing. 




 They are cryotubes. Pro-tip: don't be cheap and buy shitty ones. Your samples will thank you later. 




 A lot of specialized "hard" work pays a TON of money. 




 China is also fortunate to be able to study other countries' developmental histories and not to make the same mistakes. Case in point: today, the US is winding down its dependence on foreign oil because of shitshows like the Middle East. China is doing the same thing, but they're doing it because they've watched how other countries have turned out over the years. That's not to say they have their own very substantial challenges, but they're definitely punching above their weight. 




 Give China some credit -- for such an environmentally dirty country that is still developing beyond their manufacturing base, they sure spend way more than anyone expects them to towards alternative energy and clean manufacturing. 




 I think a parallel case in point in the USA is the oil sands in the Dakotas. The entire country got hit hard by the recession, and then these jobs started picking up in the region. If it were not for the energy sector, the area would become a literal shithole. It's not such a black and white issue -- I think a lot of people are extremely lucky to say that they can choose to prioritize environmental conservation and they should continue to do so, but the real question is should we ask those who do not have the means to do the same thing? For a lot of people, paying off their house and having food on the dinner table vastly outweighs the oilsand environmental damage. 




 Not sure why you're being downvoted. I think people don't have such a black and white view of things, but rather rank them in their own personal hierarchy. To many people who live in an impoverished country, mowing down trees for natural resources and products and jobs would not be a bad thing. Sure, it screws them in the long term, but they are starving today. They've decided that the benefits of industry outweigh the environmental costs. Many people in fully developed countries will disagree with them (myself included), but I can totally see where they are coming from. 




 not true -- if you are at a teaching hospital that works on your disease you can try to push the people there to enroll you in the stage 1 or 2 trials as soon as they start. way less than 10 years. 




 not sure why you make the oral route such a big deal. there are many drugs that are delivered intravenously,  especially in cancer treatment.  









 Pajama pants and a tshirt means she's comfortable! And if she's comfortable she's happy. If she's happy then she's way more sexually appealing. 




 OMG. Perfect timing for my story! Me and the gf went to the Columbus Zoo recently, and they had a little turtle exhibit. Lo and behold, they were getting it on. A dad and his kid strolls by and the kid excitedly exclaims "Dad!! What are they doing?!" and the father replies "...... well, what do you think they are doing?"

"I think they're wrestling!!"

"Yes, that's exactly what they're doing!"

Cue the turtle on top giving a huge O-face. "Dad, that one's so angry he's screaming!!" 




 Not sure why you are being downvoted. Obesity a huge medical issue that is really, really hard to fix with exercise. Lipo would go a great way in reducing other types of health problems, improve long-term patient outcomes, and improve self-esteem! High amounts of fat are also known to cause huge hormonal changes too so IMO it's a great idea. It's not the ultimate silver bullet, but it will go a LONG way to improving health in this country. 




 It would be utterly fascinating for plastic garbage to settle on the ocean floor, just like dead dinosaurs of eons ago. I could imagine future expeditions looking at sediment layers and really doing a WTF. 




 The crazy thing about ART and Truvada is that children are now being born without HIV, and babies born HIV+ are now starting to be cured. There is a great window of opportunity to have an all-out application of HIV drugs across the planet -- we can then contain its spread and it can literally be wiped out in a generation or two. We can't say the same about many other unvaccinated diseases. 




 But how do you contrast this with the rise of the hipster generation in the past decade? They are ironic about everything. 




 I think the main problem is that the technology's not really there yet. Unlike cancer, there's not a huge foundation of biomarkers and proposed mechanisms to build on. The ones that we do have, though, are somewhat inconclusive/have low effect size/not completely predictive. Today, at least with cancer you could sequence and find mutations that could be clinically actionable. I think the best thing we can do is try a similar approach, but instead of looking for mutations we could look at gene expression changes that could be druggable. 




 There's no shortage of disposable labor to deal with that kind of material in the more sketchy parts of the world. 




 I got an S5 literally two days ago and it's plenty fast. TouchWiz doesn't bother me at all. I really don't understand why so many people on the internet cling so hard to the "Stock Android Purity Law" as if being designed by Google automatically makes it better. In fact, I tried the Moto X, M8, and S5 all side-by-side through multiple visits to the store and guess what? I actually liked the S5 the most. People have different tastes, and apparently lots of people like Samsung's design. 




 Likewise, McCain got a lot of flak for running back to Washington during the crash in 2008. 




 A great effect is that it increases the mobility of the labor force. Don't like your job? Quit and find a better one. It will improve the quality of businesses and improve labor relations too. 




 Minimum income guarantee is a great idea, but having it be flat across the entire country is a terrible idea. Canada is a really diverse place, and $20k would be vastly different in terms of actual purchasing power.

The immediate benefit of a guaranteed income would be that the Canadian government would be effectively subsidizing *all* businesses through increased spending and (possible) decrease/elimination of the minimum wage. You would have an increase in the mobility of the labor force as people would not be afraid to change jobs. 

However, it's not an insignificant cost: The only way to make up that shortfall would be through increased taxes -- for example, the government could increase tax revenue by increasing sales taxes or business income tax. At the end of the day, though, governments aren't there to make money but to make investments in their citizens. The real question is what kind of expenditure is appropriate for the government in this kind of scenario? 




 He was the only guy that showed up to the game. Belgium dominated the entire match. 




 WTF? The Red line goes across the entire city, as well as busses being practically everywhere. Boston hits way above its weight in terms of public transportation accessibility. Going downtown is effortless, and now night owl service is starting again. I lived there for six years for graduate school (2006-2012) and I could count on one hand the number of people who owned a car. 




 Lived in Boston for six years and recently moved away. Fall is most definitely the best season. Winters (and snowstorms!) are getting a lot shorter too so there are more weeks for keeping that peacoat out! 




 Surprised this is so far down. Back in graduate school I knew a diabetic guy who had some knowledge about these types of medical devices. He said that the reason why so many of them look so primitive is because it costs so much money to get them approved and the bar is set extremely high. An iPhone app controlling an insulin/glucagon pump sounds great, but there are a million of things that can go wrong. Granted, the atmosphere regarding FDA medical device approvals is steadily changing (eg. the inhalable insulin that just got approved), but we're still a long ways off from basic medical devices reaching the 21st century. 




 Also, by nature the judicial system is *supposed* to be conservative by design. It is not there to make new laws, but rather to clarify on whether a law has been broken or whether a new law is unconstitutional.

There are other avenues for citizens to make change. They're through the legislative and executive branch by way of elections. The state and federal governments in most cases can supercede the Supreme Court through constitutional amendments. But expecting the judicial system to create new laws is not exactly an efficient method for progressivism. 




 Ticket to Ride is one of the best games that I've ever played. Excellent replay value and great for newbies.

Pandemic is very difficult but it's edge-of-your-seat exciting. The problem is that it's a co-op game so it really depends on the group dynamic (eg. one guy could dominate the entire group with his opinion). Also very tough for newbies to figure out.

Love letters is an unexpectedly fun game. A friend showed the game to me once and I was pretty skeptical. Each round is like 30 seconds long, and is extremely addictive. 




 When I realized the research interns in my lab were born after 1990. In a few years many of them will be born after 2000. 




 I went to Harvard as a PhD student and this was always confusing to me. I knew a few people that ended up getting Masters degrees from the Extension school, and also plenty of people that ended up getting certificates or taking post-bac pre-med classes. As far as I know, for the degree programs you were still enrolled under the Extension School (which is part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences), so it's unclear whether you would be sharing classes with the rest of the undergrad community. You could join all the extracurriculars and community events, though. Finally, you were also strictly prohibited from listing your degree as from "Harvard University" and had to list it as "Harvard Extension School", although I know literally nobody that actually followed this rule on their resume. 




 Actually, contrary to popular belief, most of Europe is not covered by extensive public transit. Sure, the moderately sized towns and cities have good access, but the entire European continent is literally covered in podunk and suburban towns where there is no night-time transit. Most people have to drive for work and pleasure. It's not a very long distance, but they do it anyway.  




 That's nothing -- my Gmail account has 35k+ unread! 




 Also, the original TMNT cartoons were stupid as fuck but were pretty entertaining. Anyone who thought otherwise probably has their nostalgia turned up to 11. Just fire it up on Youtube. 




 But seriously though, most of the leaks that came out were attacking Google/MS/Yahoo, and the telecoms. Barely anything with Cisco or the companies that make the hardware itself. Kind of curious if you ask me... 




 If you're white, then the only time you'll ever witness things like this happen is when they're within eye or earshot. Which means you have to be in the right place at the right time.

For minorities, women, and the disadvantaged, even one event in their lives is too many. It's stupidly naive for people in this thread to think that this kind of thing doesn't happen. 




 If there were no profit incentive, then no drug company would ever invest in the R D necessary to create vaccines. Also, the regulatory framework around vaccines is one of the most rigorous and is independently reviewed across international agencies.

Here's another thing to think about: the fundamental issue is that there is a fundamental disconnect between any given person's *perceived risk* of getting vaccinated versus their perceived risk of contracting the disease that it protects against from the general public. One is an emotional non-quantitative assessment, whereas the latter has been backed by decades of longitudinal data. Then there is also the perceived risk of trusting a pharmaceutical company with a vaccine versus the actual number of scandals that actually involved vaccines. It doesn't come down to a perception of whether a pharmaceutical company is interested in my general welfare -- it's whether I believe that the risk to my well-being is higher when I trust them to make a vaccine versus the risk to my well-being if I chose not to. The problem is that the people who choose the latter consequently compound this risk not only for themselves but also for the general public. 




 Except for, you know, the fact that many childrens' vaccines are generics, the fact that you take them only once in your life severely dampens their profits, the fact that they have dramatically improved infant mortality in developing countries (where you would also expect the rate of increase of side effects would be *faster* if these vaccines were harmful)... 

You can make up all kinds of conspiracy theories about big pharma, but vaccines (and antibiotics) are one of those things where they have the *least* incentive to mess around. 




 Also it wouldn't make any sense if bacteria/archea and fungi were considered non-vegan, because such a pan-organismic view would mean plants wouldn't be vegan either. Unless you were a level 5 vegan. 




 I'd give them a bit more credit. The Transformers movies have been getting better with each sequel. I think the writers and even Bay himself have been getting comfortable with making this type of movie. There are very few decent movies that exist today where the main characters are *not* the humans. Godzilla was terrible (despite a lot of redditors loving it, for some reason), and Pacific Rim just barely got the right balance. The Hollywood track record actually isn't very good. 




 How do you not die of carbon monoxide poisoning in a tent? 




 The Wikileaks cables also showed that many Middle East countries were practically begging the US to invade Iran. 




 A lot of drugs come from nature, but they become FDA approved. The big thing I have against dietary supplements is that you can literally say anything with the special footnote and the FDA can't do anything about it. 




 There are bars here in the Bay Area where it's okay to throw your peanut shells on the floor. I almost had a brain aneurysm when I first saw it with my own eyes. 




 Seriously, that is some high budget stuff right there. 




 I think people miss this point because of short memory. ISIS is a symptom of tribal warfare in Iraq, but ultimately grew into an actual force during the Syrian conflict. It's really a sign of bad foreign policy by all parties involved that they didn't get that situation under control. The West chose to help out Libya because it was easy, but they should have kept their eyes on the prize in Syria. The longer a civil war, especially one involving religious sects, keeps on going in a country the more likely they will gain strength/resources and spill over into neighbors. 




 I don't get it either -- the US is basically allied with Saudi Arabia for purely historical reasons. If anything, in terms of geopolitical interests the US should be allied with Iran. Both Sunni and Shia want to destroy Israel so it all comes out in the wash, but there's a huge difference between funding AQ/ISIS and Hezbollah. Iran has a huge interest in stabilizing the Iraqi and Syrian region. Both countries are theocracies with questionable human rights records, but only one of them seem to be actively trying to destabilize Afghanistan and Iraq.
