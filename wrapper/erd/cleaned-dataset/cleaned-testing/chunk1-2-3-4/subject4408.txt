 To put it bluntly, no. Your laptop has a built in GPU ('graphics card'). That slot can be used for external wireless cards, tv tuners etc. 




 I'm looking for one that has a display port input as active adapters are quite expensive. Any ideas?

Edit: Want to use eyefinity in the future so the display port saves me the cost of adapters. A monitor with both display port and dvi is ideal. 




 Have you set the power control settings to -20 in the Catalyst Control Center?
