 I was baptised a second time (first as baby) last year and this thread is making me really regret it and hold some animosity towards that church that let me go through with it. They knew I was baptized once but insisted on doing it again when I came back to God. 




 I was baptised as a baby in an Anglican church then again last year when I came back to Christ. The church I attended at the time inisted I get re-baptized. I am going through this thread and see a second baptism is unnecessary - what should I do? Was a second baptism a sin or...what?

 Well now that you've met Matlock, swiped his pills....""Take one every hour to prevent spastic heart convulsions." 




 Throne of Thunder is considered a Legacy Raid and uses the old loot system. You can run each boss, regardless of difficulty, once per week for a chance to get a Secret. Once you kill a Throne boss, your chance is used up for that week.

Siege of Orgrimmar uses the new loot system. You can repeatedly kill the first 8 bosses in LFR/normal for 1 secret per boss, for a total of 8 secrets.

Additionally, Lei Shen and Sha of Pride have a 100% drop rate on your first kill.

So if you're really unlucky, you can still get 9 per week. 1 Lei Shen, 8 from Siege of Orgimmar if you grind it out until each boss from Immerseus to Nazgrim drops one.

After that, you need 12 Runestones, which only drop from ToT Wings 3  4 and SoO Wings 1  2. Me and a guildie grinded out the Runestones in a single day, as we were very lucky with the drops from Throne of Thunder. After that you need the Heart of Lei Shen, which you can run Pinnacle of Storms again the same week as Runestones and he will drop it guaranteed.

If you have 0 Secrets, you can earn 9 guaranteed this week if you grind SoO 1/2 and kill Lei Shen. Say you are unlucky again and only earn another 9 next week: you will be unable to get the Cloak. You need to get at least 11 Secrets this week to even have a shot at getting the Cloak.

You have 2.5 weeks, as Warlords launches on a Thursday. Good luck. 




 1. Don't go to Wal-Mart.

2. You can get WoW to run a high-medium for about $500. I would suggest going to /r/buildapc and posting this same thread there. They will pick out the exact parts you need if you can (or know someone who can) build it themselves. This is your best and most cost-effective option.

Alternatively, you can get something from Amazon like [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0089KDCIU/ref=s9_hps_ft_g147_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DERpf_rd_s=center-3pf_rd_r=0YT7SJ0R85ZDVP3ZB0KZpf_rd_t=1401pf_rd_p=1880497982pf_rd_i=1000933821) or [this](http://www.amazon.com/CyberPowerPC-Gamer-Ultra-Gaming-PC/dp/B009RRJ1SE/ref=sr_1_1?s=pcie=UTF8qid=1414593804sr=1-1keywords=gaming+computer) which will run the game quite well.

 I read a while back that the government had this big tax break program for students to get their own laptops or something. Of course most ended up using their computers for free games like LoL, causing a Brazilian [Eternal September.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September)

Most Brazilians don't listen (or understand) to instruction, heed raid warnings or even know how to play their class. [In free games like LoL or Dota 2, they are notoriously worse, as the barrier for entry is access to a computer with Internet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1eluep/brazilians_need_their_own_server/ca1qkmp)

I think it has to do with language and cultural differences. Firstly, they cannot read nor speak English and therefore, are inable to read English class guides, communicate with English-speaking players or learn to play their class effectively. Secondly, South Americans, Brazilians in particular, are extremely proud (some would say arrogant) people - look at the World Cup for proof. If you try to offer criticism and help in a game, you either get Portuguese in return (hue), insulted or ignored.

So you have language barriers + cultural differences (e.g. patriotism/pride) + an Eternal September because of the supposed "free laptops" thing + lag = [a recipe for disaster.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1eluep/brazilians_need_their_own_server/ca1hsmt) 




 I'm going to say $300-400, around the price of the Aquila, maybe a bit more. It's less of a combat-capable ship than the Aquila, but serves in a similar role.

  Says who?

As a Christian, God only knows. I believe Jesus lived the perfect life and Christians should try to follow him, although we will always fail. 




 I don't know if you're being funny or not, but the story was told to a Jewish Pharisee. There are many layers to the parable, but one of the subjects of the story is the "good" son, who envied the prodigal son. Jesus was making the point of not being "holier-than-thou" and instead, act in humility and give thanks that your brother has returned from the depths of sin. 




 I am ilvl 558 and primarily raid Heroic (old normal) while occasionally playing Unholy with the same gear. Should I optimize for a DPS build, or stay survivability?

 What? I am saying that Jesus is uncreated - he was there in the beginning as John writes.

The poll indicates Evangelicals believe Adam + Eve, or whatever, came before Jesus, as if Jesus was created. 




 I am only on the first page but the thing that struck me was most DISAGREE Jesus was the firs thing God created. Have none of these people read John 1:1? 




 I would recommend Goblin for a new starting zone. Blood Elves and Draenei still use their old 1-15 zones from TBC, while the vanilla races use revamped vanilla zones.

  How can I better understand inflation?

The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and, subsequently, purchasing power is falling. 

As inflation rises, every dollar will buy a smaller percentage of a good. For example, if the inflation rate is 2%, then a $1 pack of gum will cost $1.02 in a year.

http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp

In World of Warcraft, currency devaluation happens due to a number of factors: an increase in quest reward gold, lower barriers to entry for new producers/extractors, 6.0 currency conversion and gold buying. 

The biggest contributor is the increase in level cap and subsequently, increase in quest reward gold. In Cataclysm, the average daily quest would grant about 7.5 gold. In Mists of Pandaria, daily quests would grant about 11-25 gold. 

Resources have also become more widely available to farm, specifically Ghost Iron Ore. Previously, we had to level mining to max to farm the highest tier of ore. This is no longer the case, as Ghost Iron Ore is available for mining at mining level 1, making the barrier to market entry much lower. As more people sell and buy the ore, more money is exchanging hands and in turn, re-distributing wealth.

Furthermore, with the low bar to entry comes new ways to earn profit by means of production. If I farm all the materials I need for a Sky Golem, an engineering-produced mount, the materials will likely cost around 10-12,000 gold at average market value. But I farmed those materials myself, therefore the cost is significantly reduced. I then sell that Sky Golem for a whopping 15,000 gold or so. Not only did I make a profit of 3-5,000 gold on baseline market value, but I likely made much more as I produced the materials. Those materials I farmed netted me a healthy profit and introduced more gold into the market.

Additionally, the recent 6.0 patch had converted Valor and Justice Points into gold, which will be used as the go-to currency. The average player received about 1000 gold from this conversion, substantially increasing the amount of gold in the economy.

Then there are "intangibles," or things we have no data on as players - namely gold buying/selling for real world currency. Right now, the average gold buyer sells 10,000 gold for $7-10. Let's assume $1/1000 gold for simplicity's sake. There are two kinds of gold sellers - those who manually earn their gold through farming (be it mobs or materials), or those who sell gold from stolen accounts. The former are doing the same thing our Sky Golem manufacturer does; they are converting raw material into hard currency. While buying gold from these people is still illegal, their method of producing gold is technically not illegal. On the other hand, stolen accounts end up hindering the economy by not introducing new gold; they simply redistribute stagnant wealth.

I hope this helps.

TL;DR Greater quest rewards. Lower market entry for new extractors and producers. Currency conversions. Gold buying. 




 You can run Siege of Orgrimmar normal/heroic/mythic repeatedly until you get a Secret from all 8 bosses that drop one (Immerseus - Nazgrim). Throne of Thunder has 12 bosses that will drop one, but you only get one chance per boss a week due to the different legacy raid loot system it uses.

In theory, you can get 8+12, for 20 Secrets if every Throne of Thunder boss drops one (but that is highly unlikely). Lei Shen and Sha of Pride are guaranteed to drop Secrets, so if you do not have time to run SoO constantly to get 8, you can get at least 2 for sure.

After you finish Secrets, you need to collect the 12 Runestones. You will have 1.5 weeks next Tuesday, as WoD drops on a Thursday the 13th, two days after reset. 

If you finish Secrets this week, you can very easily get Runestones done by running SoO repeatedly for 8+1 (Lei Shen), then again on Tuesday/Wednesday the final week.

 Have you played through the revamped Cataclysm 1-60 leveling? If not, I highly recommend. 




 Free food. Any university student will thank you for it. 




 What else is there? 




  celigaycy

Love it, though no homo. It's less bad for me to have sex than it is for you. 




 My advice: ignore schooling, job obligations (if you have one) and nearby friendships - focus on your girlfriend first, since she is the most important thing in your life as I can tell. Is her timezone ahead or behind you? If ahead, skip school to get extra Skyping time when she is at home. If behind, vice versa. As a mature young adult, this relationship will likely last for many years to come and you should do your best to help foster that growth. School, job...these came come later (night school for example). Don't waste this opportunity for romance that some people never have. 




 The female is scared easily by males approaching out of the blue, without any prior relationship. Don't bother - you will come off creepy and weird, especially when you cannot speak Spanish (I presume). 




 My girlfriend of two years found a box of ~~lewd~~ old videos and photos from ex-girlfriends. All of these are several years old and predate my current girlfriend. She was really upset and wants me to throw all of them away, but they have ~~masturbatory~~ sentimental value to me. Should I get rid of them? It's causing a lot of conflict. Never mind that we're a couple - my happiness is paramount to everything. 




 You do have the right to happiness; that's why I said you should kick her out. She can sell all those "pointless" things that she bought you for Christmas like a Game Boy or TV or whatever to pay for her first month's rent.

 While you could try to keep in contact via Facebook or other social media, the best option would be to move and cut off all contact with them. If they don't want to hang out in person, they won't make the effort to do it online.

If they were your real friends they would stick by you, since they should worry about your happiness - that is the most important thing. 




 She raised you for 20~ years, fed you, bathed you, housed you, free of charge. But now that she is a minor inconvenience to your happiness, that woman has got to go.

You did the right thing by coming here, rather than not discussing this with her or your sister. 




 She is a useless bloodsucker; dump her. 




 You cannot get to Perendi in a Sidewinder - the jump range is too short. 




 Yes. Keep track of what bosses drop secrets, so you know which ones to repeat again. Up to Nazgrim, each has the chance to drop 1 per week, regardless of difficulty. Keep running SoO until all 8 have dropped one. 




 Because in-engine replay systems are very difficult to make, not because developers are lazy. 




 Only the SoO bosses allow you to get repeat kills. ToT is a one-kill-a-week chance, regardless of difficulty. 




 I would like to get a whole branding package if possible. [Here is my current organization](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/orgs/HOLST), but I think it could look a lot better.

What do you guys think? 




 But Marge, that little guy hasn't done anything yet, and you know it's going to be good. 




 I would assume the animations are change server-side to be shown to you as proper third person animations. Think of it like this:

Your friend performs a melee. It looks good to them in first-person, but would look like shit, as seen in the video, in third person. The developer creates another set of third person animations that only other players see when you perform certain actions. When your friend performs a melee, that action is sent to the server client, which feeds it back to you, so you get the proper third person set of animations. 

If you played the game with the proper multiplayer third person animations, in first person, it would probably not play properly, if not look entirely fucked up to begin with (e.g. eyeball height, weapon size, field of view are all different when playing in first person). 




  no marketing building expectations.

What the hell do you call all the trailers and cinematics then? 




 In the same boat, my friend. Depression sucks. 




 The sidebar has our subreddit poll with our favourite books. Every book on there is authentic - not realistic, as we don't have their levels of technology yet - but authentic in that they feel realistic and gritty. For example, District 9 or Battlefield 4 are nowhere near realistic, but they are authentic.

 Sprawl = Vast metropolitan area that stretches along the entire North American East Coast, made up of megacities and (usually in disrepair) geodesic domes that help protect people from pollution.

Ninsei = the downtown of Night City.

 You're trying to find your faith but reject any Christian-based teaching people here try to give you. One of the tenants of Christianity is about humility - it's about admitting your wrong and don't have all the answers. I pray that you will gain at least a piecemeal sliver of Christ's humility. 




  does the bible say this is wrong?

Yes it does, many, many times.

 However we would rather have a "traditional" ceremony and have a house waiting for us.

You don't always get what you want. If you want to get married to her, do it. Have the ceremony later. You sound like a flake to me from your OP. 




 Yeah, compared to other old school MMOs maybe. But look at what people are suggesting - FFXIV and ArcheAge. Are you joking? FFXIV has what...3 raid tiers and about a dozen dungeons? ArcheAge maybe, since its emergent PvP content will provide some hundreds of hours.

But WoW has 16 tiers of raiding AND PvP content + professions + dungeons + questing + achievements + pet battles....I could go on. On my one account alone I have sunk over 2,000 hours. My old account (before it was banned for buying gold) had about the same. Still not bored with the game; I do have the occasional couple months break, but I don't seem to ever quit the game entirely.

 Hey folks, anyone here play WoW? With the new 6.0 patch out, we got lots of new stuff to play around with. I help run a guild that was founded on Christian principles, but is explicitly not a "Christian" guild. If anyone wants to play (I got 9 90s), add me at Toxilium#1491 









 I had a Cutlass before they announced the variants. I was excited to see if they made any changes to my existing ship, so I logged in. To my dismay, my hangar is completely empty, as the only ships I own are the Cutlass and Reclaimer (unavailable in hangar). 





























 Socrates died for this shit 




 nitesmoke deleted his account. the admins have /r/wow now 




 There is no proof he received calls at work. Furthermore, the only thing "doxxed" was his dating profile which NITESMOKE PUT UP HIMSELF. 

He acted in a childish, stupid manner, bullied people, and we all know he called people fags on this very sub. Yet here he is as this social justice champion. Funny how he suddenly becomes a White Knight when he's the one being attacked?

He's a compulsive liar, don't listen to anything he says. 




 He deleted his twitter and reddit account to cover his tracks. 




 You all get Nitesmoke Wolf mounts and the title, Liberator of Gay Rights 




 I would be very wary of anything Nitesmoke is telling us. First, he comes out as some social justice champion for LGBT rights. What? That shit is completely unrelated.

Second, he's changed his story multiple times to cover up his own childish behavior. He couldn't play WoW for a couple days and had a suck attack. That's the whole story. 




 He wants to pass blame for having a completely over-the-top, inappropriate and childish reaction to "Wah, I cannot play WoW."

Instead of owning up to his actions, he jumped on the hot-button issue of today (LGBT rights) and became a SJW in a short paragraph of bullshit.

In the words of a famous Blizzard dev: Fuck that loser.

 Diablo 3 is doing something similar with seasons. You start fresh each season (joining it is optional) and level up a new character from 1, with 0 gold or crafting materials. After about 6-8 months they'll reset and start season 2. 




 My first time tanking was on a bought Prot Warrior account. I paid to change the troll to Draenei male and went into Utgarde Pinnacle completely unprepared. No idea how to hold threat, no idea what any of my skills did. The group disbanded before the first boss.

The account was later banned for being traded lol.

 FYI to anyone considering purchasing the account - Blizzard is VERY on the ball when it comes to account trading. They WILL track your IP address, password changes, etc. to the account and will give a temporary suspension, without warning, if they suspect the account was traded (which is against the ToS). It has happened to me twice and I would be very cautious when trading any Blizzard account.

I have traded accounts like elite dangerous and eve online in the past, but they do not go to the extraordinary lengths Blizzard goes through to stop account trading. You've been warned. 




 890 Jump - because I'm an idiot who likes shiny new things.

Horney Ghost LTI - traded elite dangerous for this bad boy.

AMD Mustang - cheapest ship for around $30 that comes with arena Commander. It also looks cool. 




 What the hell are you talking about? Developers don't give money to publishers. The publisher funds the developer(s) and in turn, reaps the largest reward from sales. 




 Watching any sports, esports or similar event will be like that. I don't watch NHL or NFL but when I go to a live game I get super into the match

 Westboro misread the story where Jesus curses the fig tree for not producing fruit.

GOD

HATES

FIGS 




 I am a Christian and one of the last duties Christ gave was for us to go out into the world, preach the gospel and baptize people in the name of the Son/Father/Holy Ghost.

But the way these street preachers "spread God's Word*" is not the best way to go about doing that imo.

I won't go into it much since this isn't /r/christianity, but basically Christians should follow like Jesus did - he performed miracles, signs and aided people *then* followed up with his message as people inevitably asked questions. Most of the stories or parables in the Gospel are told *after* someone comes up and asks Jesus "Hey, Rabbi, why should I do y or how do I do x?" I never recall Matthew 45:16 "Then the Son of God went out into Los Angeles and held up a sign and preached to all the sinful nerds and they were saved that day."

*Funnily enough, most people think "God's Word" is the Bible. In Islam, God's Word is a physical book (the Quran), while in Christianity, God's Word is Jesus himself. The Bible wasn't even completed and compiled yet when John 1:1 was written...

 Read The Time Ships if you havent. Fav sci-fi book that is a sequel to HG wells The Time Machine. If you think Interstellars ending was crazy, Time Ships will melt your brain. 




 I think you are being a tad extreme. This is an internet forum where we're all anonymous. I don't equate these discussions to persecution of the early Christians.

I was simply raising the point that this sub seems to downvote unpopular beliefs, despite said beliefs being grounded in scripture. A good sub should upvote any post worthy of proper discussion, regardless of one's opinion or worldview. 




 Didn't you know that in this sub we upvote life-affirming reddit-friendly (i.e. usually liberal) worldviews and downvote anything we disagree with, even if there is scriptural proof to back up said views?

After Ghosts, I'm happy this is shaping up to be a great CoD. 
























 I have a GTX 670 that will run any emulator and most AAA games at 60FPS maxed. Looking to get 165 (w/shipping) for it. 




 GPU is in great working condition, with a little wear on the back panel.

Acer monitor just bought Aug 2013, so still works perfect. Keybord has evidence of wear and tear (see timestamp), but otherwise fine. Samsung monitor is a bit smaller at 1680x1050, but works fine as well. All monitors include cables.

Looking to get ~~$160~~150 incl. shipping or best offer for GPU. Taking offers for other components.

Verified PayPal only, I will invoice you and provide tracking number once shipped. Also willing to trade for Dragon Age Inquisition + $$$

 FFXIV feels incredibly empty and solo-friendly. I joined Balmung for roleplay, but the RP community practically ignores you if you're not some "notice me senpai" Miqo'te in one of their little cliques. 




 No its very easy to catch up in WoW. I quit because the new xpac is more of the same, but my guildies are enjoying it a lot. 




 The 980 is a luxury item compared to the 970, so they have free reign to charge whatever they want and know people will still buy it as it's the #1 in the world.

Personally I went for a 970 and used the money I would have spent on a 980 to get a QNIX 1440p monitor. Far Cry 4 maxed at 53-60 FPS! 




 Christianity's "cliff note" is on our sidebar. "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

 I got a Cardboard and E:D with it was awful. Google Cardboard is a novelty at most, something fun for a couple minutes with VR-supported android games. 




 I'm ugly and I'm proud! 




 I'm sure they're great, but as a game dev and writer myself, it is hard to get into the same plot again when you know everything that will happen. Same issue with Far Cry 4, but Pagan Min is intriguing enough to continue. 




 Congratulations. I pray you have a long and happy marriage :) 




 This is WoW for me. I am unsubbed from WoW now due to new expansion burnout but it will probably drag me away from FFXIV in a few months 




 How do you have so much time? 




 Is it still the same BioWare story? A villain emerges. You get tasked with assembling a team to combat said villain. You then spend some time doing side missions and building sidekick loyalty, meanwhile you do 2-3 main missions to further the main plot. You do a mission and discover villain hideout, master plan or both. You do a big epic finale. End. 




 I'm ugly and I'm proud. 




 A hi-fi indie space dogfighter with 10~ maps and some different modes and about 5 ships is maybe worth $20 at most. 




 lol 




 Heated seats and windows? This community really needs to get its priorities straight - the fish tank AI needs a serious re-tuning. 




 Want more threads about miqo'te butts? 




 Who cares? 




 While all of you are complaining, I was able to make a character after having just bought the game on sale this afternoon!

No longer need to get up at 6AM tomorrow for Balmung :D 




 Practically every fantasy F2P MMO on the market can fill your needs.... 




 Lineage ~~Two~~ One is most popular after WoW. 




 Mortal Online is a dying, empty POS. 




 Does the gil offer only work on Hyperion?  




 Take a break unless it is a game that you really want to play. I got a bunch of new games recently from Black Friday, but the only one I desire to play is Skyrim. Even the new WoW xpac bores me. 




 I am Christian myself so overly "gamer l33t" stuff like this with Jesus tacked on makes me cringe a bit, but a friend tipped me off about [Game Church](http://gamechurch.com/) a while back.

They basically are an on-line ministry that goes to big gaming events like E3, where they get involved in the community through a Christian gamers podcast, forum, hand out free Bibles, etc. 




 If World of Warcraft interests you, there is a guild called Old Farts which is mostly comprised of 30+ years, the average being in their early 40s. My own WoW guild is mostly late 20s to late 30s, with a few in their late 40s even.

There are plenty of guilds your age, but they require a bit more effort to find. 




 No. Give us the coordinates.

 You'll get your money's worth for the questing and dungeons. At end-game, once you have done all the dungeons and maybe dabbled in some raiding, not much else going for it

 good lord.... 




 Murder is murder.  




 Questing was great. Garrisons were fun during leveling too but at 100...the expansion shows its true colors. It's okay, but still more of the same (I don't know what I expected). 1 daily quest, no real 100 content outside of some repeatable heroics. Here's hoping the raids are awesome. 




 Similar story. When I was working in Laos PDR all I had was an Asus gaming laptop and Assassins Creed Brotherhood and the Office seasons 1-6. I had no other games on me for 3 months.

I 100% AC:B multiple times, must have put in 200 hours into that game. I rewatched all the Office episodes I had too.

If anyone ever goes away for a while, buy a Kobo and load it with books. You will go insane off a couple games and a show. 




 OP, you wasted 30 seconds of my life and I want them back. 




 He would have used punctuation and formatting 




 Don't take anything from brictop. Known scammer who reposts his Black Widow keyboard. Will contact you through PM only as he's banned 




 I have a GTX 670 I'm looking to sell as I bought a 970. I don't need RAM that much but I can sell you the card for 165. 




 Similar question as OP; I mainly play WoW, space sims (Star Citizen) and the odd FPS like Far Cry 3. I got a 970 from newegg, do you think that can run 1440p, 144 or 4k? Which should i look at getting and is 4k worth it with only one card? My mobo is incapable of doing SLI. 




 The pirates are so powerful they blew up the moon 




 http://i.imgur.com/QPLpNdk.jpg

 Sounds reasonable. I'll bump down my OP then to $165 OBO 




 That's why I included or best offer. How much would you pay for it? 









 He is banned from posting, that's why he will PM you instead 




 I have a GTX 670, $150 shipped. 




 If brictop comes to you in a PM, ignore him. He is a scammer and known to resell his Black Widow mechanical keyboard 




 Does 2 year insurance on a starter really matter that much? You'll be out of your Aurora and into a 300 or Cutlass within a few weeks I'd imagine.

Keep your package, it has alpha and will save you money long run. 




 Like I said - its an optional subscription if you want to see more behind the scenes stuff every month. The game just requires a pledge package for now 




 No 




 It's a development subscription - you get access to the magazine, a forum I think, some concept art. It's basically an additional way of supporting CIG and you get some cool Making-Of stuff on the side each month 




 Teach me your secrets. 




 Confirmed this is me. I couldn't post from this account as I was getting Reddit's anti-spam pop-up "Your last posts didn't do well." 




 Well I did just [list my account for sale](http://www.reddit.com/r/Starcitizen_trades/comments/2n1rmf/black_market_890_jump_specter_lti_m50_amd_mustang/), since I'd have no idea what to do with all the credits I'd rather just make a new account and buy an Aurora. 




 Can confirm, I am the same person. Wanted to get the post out there but couldn't do it from this account due to Reddit's self-posting rules to reduce spambots. 




 The annual subscription is $240 as well. I am considering doing what OP did...but I have 740 in credit if I did that. 




 Well now I feel guilty for owning an 890 Jump

Edit: sold everything for $700, still have amd mustang and $40 credit to spare for future modules. 




 Aurora LN is the best for that. LX is simply the "deluxe" version, which means it comes with a jump drive (that you can buy for the LN) and a leather seat (and who cares about that because it's a game). 




 I'd take a GTX 980 over a picture of a spaceship any day 




 Yeah, 6000 freight units (compared to 1600 in my 890) is nothing to scoff at... 




 Nothing yet. I have the Super Hornet upgrade, UEE Coat and Pistol sitting in my cart ($65 total). I am considering melting my Specter Package and buying a Merchantman, or melting my 890 Jump and getting 2-3 different ships. Or melt both packages for $740 total to get a ton of stuff 




 I'd melt the Cutlass for the Freelancer personally. The freelancer appeals to me more, but they're both good ships. 




 Get more insurance? 




 All of my ships are untradeable as I melt - buy - melt etc. 




 Someone pointed out to me the MM may be the most difficult to get as its an alien ship. The others, Starfarer and Caterpillar (I am not interested in the Ret/Glad) would be quite easy to obtain if you had the in-game credits for them.

So I am deciding if I should scrap buying the Hornet Upgrade for my Specter pack, and just go with a MM. 




 I have a Specter Hornet Ghost package from last year w/ LTI. Maybe I should melt that and pick up a MM 




 I don't think it will, based on my ~~3 second~~ in-depth analysis of the one concept picture they've released.

Why would it need to? It's just a trade ship. All it needs is a big cargo container and some guns. 




 You'd barely be able to pilot it too. I could *maybe* understand if you were the leader of say...TEST and had lots of money and hands available to help pilot. But you and I are single pilots - the most expensive ship I have is a Jump and even now I'm considering melting down to something smaller. 




 I wouldn't be either. People love to throw away their disposable income. 




 Looks really cheap. I'd pay a dollar at most 




 $2500 for a spaceship? No fucking way 




 Banu for commerce, hands down every day of the week. The retaliator is a bomber and little more.

Caterpillar is more of an in-between, as its designed for boarding and trade. 




 I have been eyeing the Banu MM and Starfarer for quite a while. I love the dirty, more cyberpunk feel to the ships than the 890 Jump. But the Jump is limited edition.

Do you guys think I should hang onto it? Right now my cart has the Super Hornet Upgrade, UEE Coat and the Aurora LX. 




 Absolutely. Best MMO on the market in the "theme park" genre. Everything about the game screams polish. WoW is the only MMO I can install, jump into and simply play without having to dick around with controls, graphics, annoying UI or weird mechanics. It's fairly simple, it's fun and it works.

On the 21st they're having their 10th anniversary special day, where they're releasing a special 40-man raid with a free mount, pet and helmet. 




 I'll be Gus, the lovable engine sweep; clean as a whistle, sharp as a thistle, best in all Westminster, yeah!

 The best way to start would be in prayer and in the Bible. Pick a Gospel (I recommend John) and get reacquainted with scripture. Ask lots of questions and try to understand what the author is writing (or what Jesus is saying). Perhaps get a biblical commentary to help you understand the underlying themes and meaning.

Additionally, 

 I no longer go to church

Start going to church. Ignore that crap on the Internet about "existential Christianity" or "home churches." Find a real church. It doesn't matter what kind to start, as long as they practice sound doctrine. Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Baptist, it really doesn't matter since they teach essentially the same thing: God loved the world so much he sent his only Son, so that whoever believes in Him will not die but have everlasting life.

Ask your friends for some church recommendations or maybe go with them one Sunday. I know you're introverted (so am I), but make an honest effort, ask God in prayer, to get out of your shell and get connected with other Christians. Join a life/study group, volunteer at charity events and give yourself to the poor.

 Is it possible for me to do this in the comfort of my room

No. A Christian is called to go out into the world and *interact* with other people. Christ didn't sit in Nazareth and send people out to do his bidding - he went into the towns and ate with sinners and healed the sick.

 I'm thinking of contacting my old friend but I know she is very busy..

If she is the Christ-loving girl you make her out to be, she probably won't care and would love to sit down and talk with you. Make the effort, give her a phone call. Don't email her, don't text her. Call. Her. Phone.

Good luck buddy. 




 Use the search function since this has been discussed many, many times.

Essentially as a Christian you're to follow the law of the land (whatever state/country you reside in). If cannabis is illegal, you can't smoke it. If it is, go nuts, but do it in moderation as to not become addicted. 




 I am guessing you don't have a toddler or spent any time around young children to see how incredibly selfish we are before we learn about etiquette and being good. Kids are assholes to each other.

It's the Christian belief we are sinful and broken *by nature,*  This sinfulness is a condition we brought upon ourselves and cannot be rectified by ourselves. You don't even need a history book or a TV to see evidence of this - sin permeates all societies of mankind, big or small. 




 Because meaning would be defined arbitrarily, simply on the whim of the individual. Who has the final say without some universal standard? These are the questions I asked myself for 10+ years on my path back to Christianity from Atheism.

I am not claiming to know anything; they're just fun questions to challenge ourselves with once in a blue moon. 




 But again...there is no point to their lives either, so why bother reduce suffering? In the words of Rust, we've become too self aware. Why not all just walk into that one last sunset? 




 That line of reasoning makes no sense 




 We need more Jews (and Orthodox) here. You guys tell it like it is. 




 If it bleeds it leads. 




 You millenials can't take a joke. 




 DAE euphoria? 




 They also believe Jesus is literally the Son of God, not just Protestants.

Source: am anglican/catholic 




  we could just as easily start a cult where we make all the adherents do their best to actually act and live as they believe 'Jesus' would have acted and lived, had he been in their shoes. 

So, Christianity?

 Muhammad had a 9 year old wife. How can you call a religion one of peace and love when its founder was a paedophile?

Those extremists are fundementalists, I.e. they follow Islam to the tee. Most Muslims are moderate and ignore the evil in their own hadith and Quran. I'd say this is God acting in their hearts to be more Christ-like. 




 No and likely never will considering he deleted his twitter and reddit account.

 No, it's not, but that shouldn't excuse the frankly bullshit "apology" he gave us, then he has the audacity to start a charity drive for an anti-bullying NGO? Are you fucking kidding me mate?

He's trying to cover up his own personal failings with the moral high ground and I'm glad most people in this thread are seeing through the bullshit. 




 He has no proof of said calls. He doxxed himself with a dating profile he posted. He is a known liar and general dickhead, frequent bully who uses the word fag like everyone else on the Internet. He's now being bullied and trying to cover his tracks. He has yet to apologize for his childish behavior.

 They are generally more relatable, as a group of misfits who all are living through Kirkwall's conflicts together. DAO's companions all kind of hated each other and DAI's companions just kind of latch onto the Inquisitor for their own personal gain (other than the original companions, e.g. Cassy and Cullen).

 He will play each for 10 minutes, get bored, then never touch them for the rest of his life. 




 Same with EA and their Dragon Age performance...I got 50FPS in Dragon Age 2 with my 970............. 




 I played Inquisition for about an hour with only the Keep video to help and I didnt know what was what or why mages were fighting templars, what the chantry was, etc. I then played through DAO and DA2, skipping most pointless side quests and just did the main stories and DLC. Playing Inquisition is drastically more enjoyable as all your actions carry more weight and you can see the cause and effect from past choicss that you made (rather than some website flash game). 




 Granted it wouldnt have the same impact. I did the Keep before DAO and DA2 and had no idea what was happening. There id no explanation about the mages plight in Thedas, who the Templars are, what Ferelden is, etc 




 I spent last night in a ditch 




 I think it's better than Origins. I just finished playing DAO and DA2 for the first time ever this past month to prepare myself for DAI which I started on Saturday. 




 Absolutely. Incredible game - make sure you play Dragon Age Origins and 2, or else the story and lore won't make much sense. 




 Why make a big post on Reddit? Why wouldn't one's immediate reaction to call EA Origin customer service? 




 I wouldn't call an unfinished alpha an "incredible game." Let's wait for release.

 I have never played through any Dragon Age and just finished Origins this past Friday :) Now about 40% through DA2. While I don't like the environments as much, the combat is way better (especially since I played mage in both).

Can't wait for Inquisition !! 




 Considering the state of modern AAA gaming - unoptimized ports that do not take advantage of all 4 cores, let alone 8 - I doubt the 8 cores will be of any advantage for quite some time unless you're doing video editing or something CPU-intensive. 




 Your CPU will rarely get to anywhere near 100% load on most games. If you want to burn your CPU, use Prime95.

As for games, it's the usual; check drivers first, uninstall old drivers, play around in-game settings and try other higher-end games (as CSGO and Smite look like last-gen games). 




 Just saying with his budget...if I were him I'd save up and get a 970 next year when the new 1080 or whatever the heck comes out. 




 Operating system?  




 When my 970 FTW really works hard I do get a bit of coil whine but its unnoticeable when game audio gets loud (or wearing headphones).

Performance wise, I get 50-60FPS maxed at 1440p in the most demanding games. Crysis 3 at max, MSAAx2, gives me about 45FPS and that is easily the most demanding game on market. The only game that is killing me is Dragon Age Inquisition @ 35-50FPS on *high* (not max). Can you say *unoptimized console port?*

If I knew about the coil whine before, I would have bought another card and down the "FTW" overclock myself. 




 You know you need to rebuy Windows for a new PC, right? 




 Get a GTX 660 - they're slightly better than a 750ti and will cost about $190 + tax. 




 I have changed it manually in-game. When I overclock to 120 or even 96, the frame skipping tests showed positive. I think my monitor just can't overclock. 




 He can build it himself and use the extra $300 to upgrade the GPU to a 970, get a CPU cooler and have change to spare

Edit: forgot to add ~$80 for the case.

Below is the same build on that website.

 How long ago did you apply thermal paste? 




 Wow very solid build man. Ask for a 1440p monitor for Christmas, $300 from Korea (ebay) :) Do you have a disc drive to install Windows?

 Do i need a cpu cooler (other than stock)?

Only if you plan on overclocking your CPU (which the 4690 can do in spades). I have the same cooler as you - let's me get up to 4.5GHz on my i5.
 Do i need thermal paste?

Yes. They're dirt cheap and necessary

 minus an anti-static wrist band, anything else i need to fully build a pc?

Get an old credit card for the thermal paste. If you have a friend with a nice toolbox, ask to borrow it (or get your friend to help build!). 




 Others reported getting their QNIX to 120Hz just fine. I tried OCing to 144Hz for fun and got crazy graphical glitches so clearly Nvidia is doing it's job. Maybe I just cannot see the difference. 




 Various benchmarks (heaven, valley), this website: http://www.testufo.com/#test=framerates

Far cry 4, dragon age 1/2/3, etc. All look the same 60 or 120 (I lower settings as I see fit to get them to run up to 120).

Strange thing is the testing website gives me 120Hz and games say the same thing. Windows says 120Hz. Nvidia says 120Hz. Even FRAPS and Shadowplay say 61+ FPS yet I cannot see a visual difference for the life of me. 




 I overclocked my QNIX to 120Hz and don't notice any difference from 60FPS :( 




 I thought you can buy any EA game and play it for 24 hours then return it? Or is that only for PC? 




 You get the same kind of goodies with other pre-orders; how is this any different? 

 Even if there's problems at release, they will be promptly fixed and all new content for the game will be free.

But how do you *know* this? Every developer has claimed the same, yet time and time again this is not always the case. 

Watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf5Uj4XIT1Y

What is with this attachment people having to developers? You don't know them. You don't work with them or for them. You pay them money for a product when it *releases.* Pre-ordering is so incredibly fucking pointless for digital products, it boggles the mind why someone except the most rabid of fanboy would go through with it.

I don't fucking care if Witcher 1 and 2 were great (they were). You don't work for CDProjekt Red. They could have entirely new management for all we know and completely fuck up Witcher 3. You don't know. All you have is this blind, unfounded faith in a group of Polish game developers. It makes no fucking sense. 




 I tried overclocking mine and Nvidia and Windows BOTH said it was at 120Hz at some point...yet I saw no difference with mouse, window and in-game movement. Maybe my eyes "can't see past 60fps?"

The online monitor test said it was at 120hz too, yet the 120 and 60fps UFOs didn't show any difference.

http://www.testufo.com/#test=framerates 




 Why are you pre-ordering? What fucking purpose does that serve? Have you learned nothing from other games?

I don't care if GabeN himself came into your room with Half-Life 3 and offered it as a pre-order - don't fucking pre-order games. There's no point anymore. 




 Get a 1440p monitor for now - you will notice a substantial difference from 1080p, a single high-end GPU can run the vast majority of games at 60FPS on max settings and they're fairly inexpensive (I got my QNIX 1440p monitor within 2 days from Korea for $300). 




 750ti is shit for the price they're probably offering. 




 I am running a GTX 970 @ 1440p, with an i5-3570k @ 4.5GHz. I should not be getting FPS stutters in a game like Dragon Age 2.

What gives? This game is optimized horribly. It goes anywhere from 45 to a constant 60 (which is where it should be all the time). 




 Staples employee here. Same deal - diagnostic for $50, then whatever we need to do is extra. Usually around $150 for a whole setup dealy 




 For the 200 price range, 660 is good, 760 is best. I do have an old GTX 670 since I upgraded recently, but I can't explicitly sell things on this subreddit (that's what /r/hardwareswap is for).

http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/high_end_gpus.html 




 $160 if you're Canadian, more cause international shipping (gimme your postal code and i can do the calculation). 




 Don't need the watch - I like my traditional analog watches ;)

But I got a Gigabyte GTX 670 that's only 2 years old, still runs great. I upgraded to a GTX 970 last week, so looking to sell it. This is the model: http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125423

It will work SLI with your Zotac, as they're both 2GB version. 




 Well it will be cheaper at least later if you want another card for Crossfire 




 Wow that CPU is way overpowered for your GPU. 

Get this one: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116942nm_mc=AFC-C8Junctioncm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-na-_-na-_-nacm_sp=AID=10446076PID=3938566SID=

With the $50 you save, upgrade your GPU to a 760 instead. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127744cm_re=gtx_760-_-14-127-744-_-Product

Otherwise it is a fine build. Sexy case 




 Dang they price corrected :( 




 Get this instead - substantial upgrade for $30 more: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814202080cm_re=290-_-14-202-080-_-Product

And 500W is fine if you're not using 2 cards. 




 See for yourself: http://ssds.findthebest.com/compare/574-632/Crucial-MX100-512GB-CT512MX100SSD1-vs-Samsung-850-Pro-1000GB-MZ-7KE1T0BW

TLDR: not really. 1TB one has better warranty, longer life span, and better random speeds (but that is very minor at this stage). 




 I am a game dev too, so I have 16GB in my desktop. I started with 8, and like I said, waited for RAM go on sale - which it often does. I'd suggest using the extra money to get the 290X now if you find a good price, then wait for RAM to get marked down in a few weeks for Boxing Day.

For Maya, Adobe CS, etc. 8GB is enough unless you're doing super heavy-duty stuff (like an extremely hi-res model of a Star Citizen-esque spaceship).

Unless if you need the RAM now, the 290 is still a great card.

Do you have peripherals already? 




 1TB is 62cents a GB. 512 is 40c a GB. The 512 is more economical - also if one drive fails you're not completely screwed. 




 Hard drive? SSD? Will need somewhere to store Windows + games.

And unless you really need 16GB ram (which is usually overkill), get 8GB for $50 less and use that money towards and 290X instead.

If you need 16GB, wait for Boxing Day when that kind of stuff (RAM, hard drives, small stuff) goes down 50% off. 




 FYI for those getting a 970, the FTW is only another $20-30 and has a significant overclock 




 980 if you have the money. Or 970 now and SLI later. Don't need a steam box; just get HDMI cable to tv, run Steam Big Pictute with controller. 




 Get a 1440p monitor and we got the same PC (minus the 2 SSDs) 




 Probably next summerish, I'd say a year's anniversary and we'll start seeing announcements about a transition 




 Hey Bart want to go play with the x-ray machine in that abandoned hospital? 




 At least Molyneux makes decently fun, albeit shallow games. Dean just made a shitty mod for a shitty engine then charged suckers like myself $30 to play. 




 Thats bullshit. Ive worked with NZ, AU and Canadian expats in the telecomm field and all he needs is a work visa. 




 He's an ideas man who abandons projects before completion
 If he can show me a finished game I'll regain consumer confidence in him, otherwise he can fuck off with his new studio. 




 Well I'll just keep these then 




 Did you overclock anything? What drivers? Can you take a screenshot of your settings and/or in-game FPS? I'm dying to get above 40FPS at 1440p 




 Far Cry 4 runs at 45-50FPS on ultra for me at that resolution and GPU

Dragon Age Inquisition even worse at 35-40FPS. How does Crysis 3 run better than DAI on my 970? 




 The new Runescape has a scary resemblance to Albion. 




 eve? darkfall? tibia? and you say AA is not close? dafuq? How has no one mentioned Runescape, the almost direct predecessor to Albion Online? Fuck, they're even similar in art and interface style.

 Awesome OP. I have, unfortunately, had the opposite experience on Balmung. Cliquey roleplayers, elitists and other snobs who completely ignore me if I try to roleplay or ask a simple question. 




 I did the tapestry thing on EA's website and had no idea what was going on LOL, so it may be a good idea 




 I own all three Dragon Ages, but never played 2 nor progressed far in Origins. Should I play them before Inquisition, or is the story not really related?

I loved how Mass Effect kept the same character through all three; does Inquisition do the same? 




 Aftermarket coolers can extend the life span of your CPU, overclocked or base clock. 




 Sold my account back in June when I saw them first changing labour points. 




 The game has good lighting...and that's about it graphic wise. 




 And DUST 514 




 [Yup](http://imgur.com/gKvVQLH)

edit: I like how OP is clearly a selfie, when his "GF" could have taken the photo 




 How old is it? 




 Nuuvem has it cheapest right now 




 If you get the buyer protection for $1 you get a guaranteed key or your money back 




 "oooh, ice creamville" 









 What's wrong with QNIX? I got one last week and it's awesome. Overclocked to 120Hz easily. Korean all the way from now on; so cheap and just as good. 




 Would an 8800 Ultra work? I got one of those too lying around. 




 I have a 2GB 670 for sale or trade (looking for the new dragon age or razer naga) 




 Samsung Syncmaster 2253LW and Acer G245HQ
