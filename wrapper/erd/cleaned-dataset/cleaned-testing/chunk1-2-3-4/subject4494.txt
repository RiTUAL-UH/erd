 I know canon was the same, but I think it's too implausible that Quirrell happened to come across V just when Tom was about to come to Hogwarts, with exactly enough time for him to get a job. 




 Why is Voldemort known to be Tom Riddle? There seems to be no good reason for him associating them, so why isn't his Voldemort persona anonymous?   



















 The situation between H and Q looks like classic Parfit's Hitchhiker. They each have no reason to cooperate afterwards, but have reason to believe that they will.

So who thinks this is all a leadup to a discourse on how to solve the problem in full generality? 



















 I see a bunch of tumblr posts (see https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/inappropriate-audition-songs) which follow the format of 

Hi Ill be auditioning for the role of X and Ill be singing Y by Z.

What's going on? 














 1. Hypothesis: "Harry" is a trigger that brings back his memories when said by Quirrell, which is why he never said it before.

2. Snape taught at Hogwarts for 7 years. Harry is 11, and was 1 when his parents died. Snape only came to Hogwarts 3 years after Voldemort disappeared, which is 3 years later than in canon. See http://www.hp-lexicon.org/timelines/timeline_snape.html, which sources this from canon. This is probably significant.

3. I'd like to mention my last theories thread, which didn't get much attention because it was posted right before the new chapter. https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w0xiz/last_crazy_thread_before_it_updates_spoilers_102/

4. I think Snape is being controlled by Quirrell also, as I don't expect Sprout to be powerful enough to have downed him. Remember, everyone found it *plausible* that Snape had actually downed Quirrell in Diagon Alley, so Snape must be pretty powerful. 



















 Here, in no particular order, are all my crazy theories/questions that I wanted to get out before the update, from my notes. Assume spoilers all:

1. Why didn't Lucius know that Harry wasn't getting his mail? He should have at least asked Draco to tell him if Harry got anything or something.
2. There's precedent for Harry's thoughts being hidden; Harry's plan to have Draco rule wasn't mentioned until he said it in the meeting (assuming it was true).
3. Why did H C talk to Zabini and then immediately obliviate him? Seems wasted.
4. Why didn't they try to test Lucius to see if he was telling the truth about the Mark?

His own Death Eaters did not know it until afterward, hence the false Mark I bear; though since I did not truly consent, it does not bind me.

Surely someone had a test that would tell whether the Mark bound him? Since they thought that the Mark sealed the lips of the bearers about itself, why didn't they demand that Lucuis tell them how the Mark worked, and test the response? This seems much simpler than Harry's thing with the actual mark.

* 5. Why is the prank when Harry learns about time-turners in his style? Presumably Harry would still cooperate with the prank regardless of whether it matched his style, so what does that tell us about how Time works?
* 6. Why didn't Lucius know at the trial that Harry could cast a patronus? He gave Draco Veritaserum, right?
* 7. Mcgonagall seems to have a *lot* of killing intent. Why?
* 8. Snape is a Legilimens, which implies he's a perfect Occlumens as well. Why did Voldemort think he could trust the prophecy that he took out of his mind?

I omitted a few that I couldn't figure out they meant. Need to take clearer notes to make time-travel communication easier ... 








































































































 The first time I read through HPMOR (until chapter 101), I really didn't think Quirrell was Voldemort and behind both the Hermione plots. The main reason for that was because Dumbledore had a lot of evidence pointing towards him, and I kept on switching back and forth between thinking Dumbledore did one or both of them to Quirrell or some other perp. (What's mentioned in Harry's conversation with Lucius seems to pin it down, as well as some other things throughout the book.)

Then I saw that [Meta Spoiler](#s "EY had confirmed QQ=V in a retracted Author's note, which confused me. I now think it's almost impossible for that not to be true in at least some sense, or for QQ to not be behind both the duel and troll.")

However, all the evidence that points to Dumbledore is still there, and I don't want to blame *all* of that on Quirrell setting things up.

So my hypothesis is that Q and D are in this together, where "this" is some plan involving getting Harry to fulfill both of their wants.

Evidence in favor of this:

1. Dumbledore accepts Q apparently without needing to know who he is
2. Dumbledore doesn't grow suspicious of Q at any point in the year
3. There are pieces of evidence pointing to both D and Q for the same plots
4. Dumbledore let Harry off too easy for the prison breakout
5. Dumbledore plays along with the plot to get Hermione sent to Azkaban

Pieces of evidence against:

1. Dumbledore lost a lot in the war against V, including his brother (perhaps it's not really him/taken over by Horcrux, or brother's death was staged)
2. Dumbledore appears moral (perhaps he still believes in the greater good/ is trying to achieve immortality despite what he told Harry)

I'm willing to bet for this at 10:90% odds (I'll put up 1 to your 9). Any takers or alternate offers?

Edit: archived at https://archive.today/cZlqY for the bets.

Got this email with the subject line "[ATTENTION SENIORS] If you have $20, this explosive cryptocurrency could change your life"

https://imgur.com/a/F6E7L

So, of course, I immediately clicked on the link, curious which alt coin they were pushing.
The link was to http://pro.wallstreetdaily.com/TAOREWARDSUSPRC/LTAOR209/?h=true, and the long text explanation of what was being sold is at http://pro.wallstreetdaily.com/TAOREWARDSUSPRC/LTAOR209/Full?h=true

Some hilarious excerpts

The value of Bitcoins in circulation has now topped $1.5 billion  more than twice the market cap of Apple.
No wonder major companies like Dell, Amazon, and Target, all accept Bitcoin as payment.

Hahahahahahahaha.

Someone must have done the math too quickly, and thought that Apple's market cap was 700 *million* instead of billion.

And apparently Amazon and Target now accept bitcoins. Wonder if they got that from Gaw? That would also fit with the "get in for under $20" hahahaha.

Before I reveal this opportunity in detail, please allow me to **formerly** introduce myself.

Wait, does that mean you already introduced yourself?

No wonder Americas elite are using it too, including Jerry Seinfeld, Robert DeNiro, and Britney Spears. Its rumored that Denzel Washington used this currency to pay for a $30 million private jet.

Yeah, you can say anything in an article and that will make it have been "rumored". This probably can't be topped.

Even President Obama flashed it to the world while purchasing his lunch.

I take that back.

However, Ive discovered an amazing loophole in Americas rewards-points system.

And you chose to share it with all of us, of course. Wonder what that implies about its viability?

The report reveals the company actively mining Americas top rewards points systems...

Ooh! Mining!

I peg the value of your first opportunity at upwards of $56,700.

... and I'll sell it to you for only $9.99. Aren't I nice?

On page 109 Chris reveals how a morning stop to his local 7-Eleven made him a fortune. Since Chris is an avid Snapple drinker, one day, he noticed the stores shelf spaaaaaace for Snapple products had shrunk from two full refrigerators to less than half of one.
He immediately took action, executing his incredibly simple information arbitrage strategy.
The very next week, Snapple announced that its inventory of unsold products had sharply risen, negatively impacting the companys profits.
Chris tripled his investment in a few days.

... is there anything I could even say to this? My guess is that he is either flat out lying, or invested in hundreds of companies and only reports the profitable ones.

Chris reveals how a friends unassuming Facebook post scored him a quick 50% gainer. The post simply said, Oh my! Chuggington?!!! I think my kids have died and gone to heaven!
Within days of observing the post, Chris perfectly executed his information arbitrage strategy and invested ahead of Chuggington becoming a smash hit among children. 

How can I get him to follow me so I can pump everything I own to this very rich person?

Below are a few of the fantastic letters I received from readers last week...

This is in almost every scam pitch I've ever seen.



Final thoughts: I am really disappointed. If you're going to write a scam pitch, at least make sure all the irrelevant facts in it are true. Also, this is dated from October, so why did I only get an email this week? Someone's slacking off.

(The company referred to is http://investor.points.com/, and obviously Robert Williams owns a large number of shares in it.)

 I know that the code says for coins not to be mined eventually. However, bitcon is likely to be hard forked many times by then, and miners are the ones who decide what happens, so why won't they just decide to continue making coins? They won't have the same commitment to keeping the protocol as us 100 years back, and would do whatever is best for them. Assuming bitcoin is still around then, what factors will affect whether coins stop being mined like scheduled?

The same question goes for every halving. What incentive will miners have to play along? 




 I think we're over due for a crazy theories thread, so here! My own list will hopefully get typed up on the 27th if I get around to it.

 In the conversation Harry had with Mcgonagall in Diagon Alloy, we learn that he isn't superstitious:

Um Harry said. He took a deep breath. Thered been some muggings in our neighborhood, and my mother asked me to return a pan shed borrowed to a neighbor two streets away, and I said I didnt want to because I might get mugged, and she said, Harry, dont say things like that! Like thinking about it would make it happen, so if I didnt talk about it, I would be safe. I tried to explain why I wasnt reassured, and she made me carry over the pan anyway. I was too young to know how statistically unlikely it was for a mugger to target me, but I was old enough to know that not-thinking about something doesnt stop it from happening, so I was really scared.

So it is surprising that on at least two other occasions, in Chapter 21 and 38, he does things which are blatantly superstitious. 

And Harry was sitting in the cavern level of his trunk, slid shut and locked so no one could get in, a blanket pulled over his head, waiting for the week to be over.
10:01.
10:02.
10:03, but just to be sure
10:04 and the first week was done.
Harry breathed a sigh of relief, and gingerly pulled the blanket off of his head.

and:

He didnt sit at the same nearby table hed sat down at with Draco, the first time hed prepared to board this train. That seemed like tempting history to repeat itself.

I'm *very* wary of suggesting this, but as it happened twice, maybe it's significant? Could someone have messed with his mind enough to change how he thought about fate? We know from the first chapter that magic caused Harry to believe that it existed without proper evidence (or at least that's how I read it, as confirming that intuitions exist in HPMOR). But Harry still hadn't updated by the time of the Diagon Alley talk, for some reason. 









 death, taxes, and people who can't count. 









 If partial transfiguration is just "enforcing a relation between separate past and future realities, instead of changing anything over time", then why can't it be used for arbitrary time-travel? Enforce a relationship between the me of "whatever now means" and the me of "now shifted to the past/future"? 


































 Harrys own voice said, then, sounding strange in present-Harrys ears, He has a surprisingly good explanation.

Why did Harry say that? Obviously, the direct cause of that statement was that Future!Harry remembered hearing it while he was Present!Harry. However, this doesn't explain the real cause. We know from elsewhere in HPMOR that time seems to do that kind of stuff when there would otherwise be a paradox. So this sentence implies that, had Harry not known of a good explanation coming, something would have happened that would cause him to try to change time. What was that? What would have happened had he not been told that, that was drastic enough to cause Time Itself to twist? Remember, Harry knows Not To Mess With Time, so it would have to be **really really important** for him to try doing something.

(I'd also like to point out that, since he heard the explanation while anticipating a good one, he is automatically subject to confirmation bias, meaning he would notice less if it wasn't good, without any Harry ever deciding it was good by "himself".) 




 I've read a little bit about this "net neutrality" thingy and I don't really get why it is a good thing.

As I understand it, we (the protesters) want the FCC or whoever to keep *more* regulations. That's the first red flag. I haven't seen any explanation of why the free market wouldn't work in this case.

Second, if your ISP started slowing down smaller websites, what would you do? Well, what if there was another ISP that wanted your business, and they offered equal speeds for all websites? You know what would happen? Three guesses:

* Everyone switches to ISP #2
* Everyone switches to ISP #2
* Everyone switches to ISP #2

That's called a free market. Do you know why Sprint still offers unlimited data for smartphones after all the other US carriers started limiting the amounts? Because there's a market for it. There are people who would switch away from Sprint to whoever offered a better service.

If all these people who signed, called, emailed, and otherwise joined the campaign, instead signed a petition that they would switch away from any ISP that doesn't give all website the same bandwidth, wouldn't that create significant incentives to ISPs to maintain the status quo? And companies that might pay for faster speeds will get less people to reach with them, so the prices will go down, and the ISP will not be gaining that much, so they'll switch back to neutrality soon.

I'm willing to change my view if someone can explain what I'm missing. I'm trying to understand, and don't get it. So why does the free market fail in this instance, and why is the government needed to step in? 




 Well in chapter 9:

Though Harry had been right to consult a Ravenclaw prefect first. The young woman hadn't even looked up from her reading or identified Harry, just jabbed a wand in Neville's direction and muttered something. After which Neville had acquired a dazed expression and wandered off to the fifth carriage from the front and the fourth compartment on the left, which indeed had contained his toad.

So there's a prefect (possibly Penelope Clearwater, possibly not) who knows some mind control methods, hanging around Hogwarts and Harry. I don't think a simple charm could have done that, it seems like it would need Legilimency to get the information and Confundus, Legilimency, or Imperious to get Neville to go there. I don't see any way around the Legilimency requirement, which is "incredibly rare", and thus suspicious. Is there any other method that could have been done with standard magic, or should we be *very* suspicious of unnamed prefect?

(I suppose it could have been done by hiding the toad in a known location beforehand, then sending Neville there with a standard Confundus, but it doesn't seem like she was setting it up, and she wouldn't know that she would be approached [or she could have Confunded Harry and Neville to approach her specifically, but we're getting complexity penalties at this point.]) 




 I don't know if this theory has been proposed before, but what if

The curse on the Defence job works like the Comed-tea? That is, only wizards who are going to get caught doing a fireable offense during the next year get unexplained urges to work at Hogwarts? That might explain Quirrell's stated reason for working at Hogwarts, if he is not QuirrellMort.

Are there other plausible hypothesis for how the curse works?

It appears that only documents are included, based on filenames extensions. It also appears that many documents not in txt format were converted to txt. They were then published twice, once in original format and a second time in txt format. Not all documents, for some reason. So the true amount of documents published now is a little over a half of 30,000.

The following formats are in the list:

* xlsx
* pdf
* txt
* docx

This suggests both that Wikileaks published only "document files", not all files (and horrible reporting by those who don't have a clue), and that they only took from the 01, 02, 05, and bonus filesets.

I'll confirm when I have more time whether any documents from the other sets appear in wikileaks list, as the naming *could* just be a quirk.

Edit: nvm, it's up. https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/120/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality 









 As you know, there has been a lot of speculation that we are still in the DATA EXPUNGED. There are a couple of variations on this theme, but they all agree that REDACTED and that it really *was* REDACTED. On my recent reread, I noted all the parts in the text which appeared to support the claim that DATA EXPUNGED, and am collecting them here. There's also a section on WoG confirmations which can be REDACTED.

First, we get this right in the beginning:

Ad-free mirror of the text;

clearly implying that the entire text is inside a mirror (see document 297-T-REDACTED for further elaboration on this).

Second, we see in the intro what appears to be an obvious DATA EXPUNGED:

 This is a rationalist story;

Rationalist comes from ancient Latin from mirror. In fact, if you search google for Rationalist mirror, [hpmor comes up](https://archive.today/KzShE). But this might not be conclusive, because of REDACTED and REDACTED.

Third, we get in Chapter 6 the following

There was an abstracted look on her face (almost exactly the same look that had appeared on Harry's own face while experimenting on the pouch, if Harry had only seen himself in a mirror to realise that).

This is obviously foreshadowing DATA EXPUNGED and DATA EXPUNGED, as well as providing strong evidence that people are stuck in a mirror and can't see through it.


Fourth, there is the widely talked about DATA EXPUNGED from Chapter 6

As his hand touched the back door's handle, he heard a last whisper from behind him.

"Hermione Granger."

"What?" Harry said, his hand still on the door.

"Look for a first-year girl named Hermione Granger on the train to Hogwarts."

"Who is she?"

There was no answer, and when Harry turned around, Professor McGonagall was gone.

This strongly implies that Professor REDACTED was left out of the DATA EXPUNGED, for reasons too obvious to detail.

Further on, we observe (Chapter 10)

I am in essence a sort of mirror with which to trap children

possibly the most explicit confession in-story to date, with the possible exception of DATA EXPUNGED

Then we get to 27

The Weasley twins had tested their new monocles on the "forbidden" third-floor corridor, making a quick trip to the magic mirror, but when they tried to go back, they'd realized they were stuck forever.

Moving on, Chapter 37:

"Yes!" said Dumbledore. "My own great foe was Grindelwald, and him I understood very well indeed. Grindelwald was my dark mirror, the man I could so easily have been, had I given in to the temptation to believe that I was free of the mirror, and therefore sure of my observations.

This is starting to give some clues that the mirror is connected to Grindelwald. I looked through REDACTED to find more clues, and sure enough DATA EXPUNGED:

 I am Grindelwald. I am also the mirror, and have been so all along. I am also [Millicent Bulstrode](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2f7csv/whats_the_craziest_theory_you_can_come_up_with/ck6mynp). Indeed, I am even DATA EXPUNGED. You are also.

So we know where it came from.

Next, let's look at chapter 54

Thirty seconds later Harry was the proud new owner of a curved mirror, and quickly walked into it (which confused his mind for a bit, before he got distracted by whatever he wanted).

And

The mirror lay alive and vibrant in his hand.

And

his mirror was perfect

This confirms that it infected Harry early on, but in case you're uncertain see 63:

 Harry had been infected by the mirror for as long as he could remember

Now, one thing we *haven't* confirmed is whether Hermione is in the REDACTED. Chapter 72:

Hermione reached into her robes, and drew out a little rod with a mirror on the end of it and an eyepiece. The mirror quickly took over her body and mind, leaving her in eternel bliss.

Plus this bit of REDACTED from 77:

Hermione hadn't tried walking past a mirror yet, she wasn't sure she wanted to.

Plus a little later in 84 we get confirmation that the mirror is responsible for Hermione dying:

The mirror cut off abruptly.

Susan, 73:

For an instant, she glowed in a strange mirror-color, like a reflection of herself, until the mirror swallowed her whole

Tracey, 74:

Well, I'm pretty sure I did," said Tracey, sounding briefly uncertain before she rallied. "I mean, I looked at myself in a mirror and I look paler and can make my wishes come true now, and I can always feel darkness surrounding me, and I was a conduit for his dread powers and everything...

Pansy, 74:

After Pansy drew out a mirror and looked at herself, she turned even paler.

Now we know where it came from, who it infected, DATA EXPUNGED and REDACTED, but who has it now? Let's look at 82:

Terrible and stern stood the ancient wizard, like he was carven from stone; beard woven of thread like iron, half-moon glasses like mirrors, and the pupils behind as sharp and unyielding as black diamond.

So there *was* a pair of glasses that [wasn't just that](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2x4lxu/im_way_better_at_having_bad_ideas_than_good_ones/), after all.

Now, there's also a piece of evidence suggesting that DATA EXPUNGED, as well as proving that the REDACTED can hold multiple people at once (84):

The mirror transmitted a sound of muffled laughter in the background, sounding like it was coming from more than one person.

Let's skip to 100:

The mirror was in Draco's hand, and it remained lifeless as his finger mechanically tapped at the surface, over and over.

This is definite foreshadowing of the mirror breaking at some future point, which is consistent with information gotten from REDACTED.

WORDS OF GOD

There are a couple of statements from the author of reality, REDACTED, which provide support for this theory.

1. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xxybs/chapter_116/cp4fzlj?context=3) THEY'RE IN THE MIRROR

2. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xxybs/chapter_116/cp4hnx1?context=3) You're inside the mirror
3. [here](http://hpmor.com/notes/119/) yes they are still inside the Mirror of DATA EXPUNGED.

(Note: this last one is proof that even the events up to 119 are still part of REDACTED.)


Note: this was inspired by https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w3z8p/its_been_in_front_of_us_all_along_spoilers_all/, and also by SCP. This is also a first draft, if you have any suggestions on how to make this flow better I'm open. I'm not too good at structuring long things like this.

18 minutes and counting! 
























 ... or just patent it then sue. It's a lot easier.

 First of all: I've seen parts of this out there already. I came up with this mostly on my own, trying to be original, but there's obviously not *too* much to work with, and I had already seen some attempts.

So. Harry has been told that the first thing done to him is Stunning. The obvious step here, is:

Partially transfigure himself. Harry transfigures two layers of the skin around his entire body. The outer layer is transfigured into dead skin (or something the same color), so he still looks normal. The inner layer is transfigured into a substance which blocks (preferably absorbs) at least the stunning spell.

Two tiny layers of skin coming off should be perfectly safe (have not gotten an answer from a doctor here, so don't try this at home).

He delays while talking to V as long as possible. When he's done, they "stun" him. He falls down, and makes sure his wand is pointed towards his time-turner.

He should have at least a few minutes before they begin chopping off his limbs, during which their guard will be down. He uses this to transfigure his skin into a line of *something* (will elaborate) towards his time-turner. This substance is designed to look like the surrounding air, so it is effectively invisible. Once it is in contact with the time-turner, Harry is able to transfigure the time-turner, then untransfigure it to right beside him. It is still hidden by the camouflage transfiguration. He then gets the time-turner into his hands, and twists it.

As soon as he is in the past, he sends a message to Moody, Bones, and Dumbledore, and tries to leave.

Anyway, if there are any ideas here anyone feels are new, feel free to take them and use them in your own answer. 














 ... the update notices (i.e. "the next update will be") are still there. Has /u/EliezerYudkowsky  gotten lazy or does that mean anything?

 Is it before Harry got the message? Surely summoning all the Death Eaters would notify Dumbledore, and he'd send someone to pick up Harry like by Azkaban. This didn't happen, so something I believe must be false.

Even if it's after, someone would go back in time, or know that they couldn't.

Also, where is this? Are we at the graveyard, or a "real" one assuming the one dosed was fake, or somewhere else? 




 ... that current!Harry is missing some memories, and that was masterminded by the good guys (either himself or Dumbledore). Additionally, this is causing him to act in a way that appears non-optimal, but is necessary for reasons that will be explained. (Possibly because he needs to believe some things to say them in Parseltongue.)

  Did they not completely fabricate the murder for hire charge which was enough to get him the negative media attention before the charges were dropped?

No. One out of 6 hits was set up by the agents, although it wasn't fabricated; Ulbricht did order them. The other 5 are not known to be by the corrupt agents.

How do you calculate *more* criminal activity? 









  If I can still affect it after you've already collapsed the measurement, that would seem problematic, especially if "you" and "I" refer to things the size of people.

But "I" and "You" can't communicate with each other. As far as I'm concerned, you haven't collapsed yet and are in a superposition.

You raise a good point that this may set a lower bound on how large superpositions can grow before they collapse; of course in non-Copenhagen interpretations this is irrelevant. I don't think this experiment proved it in anything near the size of a person, though.

I think defining "observer" is still an outstanding problem, but I'm just a layman. Do you know of any decent not-too-technical descriptions available about the progress of figuring out "what causes the collapse" so to speak?

I'm also a laymen, but try https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/9857/what-is-an-observer-in-quantum-mechanics and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_(quantum_physics). 









  Then goodbye causality

Why?

And who is this "you" of which you speak?

This can be any observer, does not require consciousness.

That is the hard problem of the Copenhagen interpretation.

You'll note I worded my comment to not require Copenhagen ... 




  You started talking about free market motivation of black markets and his philosophy and now you are just parsing words just to make a point .

I disagreed with what you said above, and said so.

If you have anything else to add please do so in the form of a logical discussion.

I think you are incorrect in your claim above that he "knew it was wrong", and I'd like you to either retract that statement or defend it. 









  It's a distinction without a difference in this case. So he knew he was doing something illegal, ergo he got caught and is going to jail.

No argument here.

I really don't understand what you are arguing at this point.

Your claim that he "knew he was doing something wrong", which I think is not supported.

I get it, he's is your hero

 I also take full responsibility and apologize for misrepresenting survey incentives and funding in LaCour and Green (2014).  In fact, I received a grant offer from the Williams Institute, but never accepted the funds,the LA GLBT received funding from the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr.  Fund., and the Ford Foundation grant did not exist. 




 But how do you prevent abuse? Can I convince the server that road X has 1000 cars on it if I want to keep people away, for example?

 If you didn't see the measurement, it hasn't collapsed/decohered relative to you. So you can still affect it. 




 How do you go from "he knew and participated in illegal activity" to "he knew he was doing something wrong"?

Many people don't identify morality with law, maybe Ross is one of them. 




 Ross opened a market with very few restrictions on what could be sold. He's said many times that he did this for philosophical reasons.

You claimed that he must have thought it was wrong, but haven't explained why.

Many people have defended him and think he did nothing wrong; why is it impossible that he also thought so? 




 His lawyer claimed in sentencing that it may have been role-play, because apparently people don't always mean things they say online.

Also, one of the six hits was faked by the corrupt agents. 




 Yeah but why would J be friends with him in the first place before making sure he wasn't a purple?

 That "exploit" was for poorly made apps that didn't verify receipts. Locking down content already on a user's device is not such a great idea anyway.

MITMs with user consent are not a security problem, except insofar as users are stupid. 




 Huge impact upwards, yes. If Apple loses money in the market by dumping for less than the buy price, that money goes to the other people in the market and supports a higher price. 




 You said he must have thought it was wrong, but why couldn't he have thought free markets are right? 




 That's an issue with the law, not the trial. 




 You can't destroy a market without holding coins, at least not directly. Buying then selling has little effect. Shorting could have a greater effect, but only insofar as Apple has the ability to short, and there are probably limits.

Declaring debate over is a very bad sign. 




 That was the same complaint parent had rephrased. Many hodlers wouldn't sell except at exorbitant prices, I don't know how many coins are like that, but I'd expect a significant amount of coins to go unsold if Apple stepped in. 




 Maybe that's because they didn't have much of a case. There were also a bunch of tactical mistakes made by the defense.

Do you think all trials with guilty verdicts are shams? 




 They couldn't get all (some have been burned, Satoshi's, etc), but likely can get an 80% majority if they were willing to use all their money on it. 




 You seem to think somebody can't actually believe in free markets enough to break the law, why is that? I'm not following your logic here. 




 What parts of the trial were shammy? 




 When was a plea offered? 




 It wasn't always clear, tobacco companies lied for years about it. There's a reason they paid billions to lawsuits.

 That's irrelevant to my view, which is strictly consequentialist and therefore doesn't care about blame.

 I looked at the context, and referenced it above.

He's clearly talking about a one-time increase, if you look at the code at the beginning of the thread. There's absolutely nothing that implies multiple increases, as you claimed above, and have not shown. 














  The point is that "auto increases over time" is equivalent to what Satoshi meant by "phase it in."
 Both of which refer to making the change non-abrupt -- with ample warning, ample lead time, etc.

No. Auto increases mean that no hard forks would be necessary in the future, the block size would increase whenever it's needed. What Satoshi wrote was just a single one-time increase. 




 The part you claimed above to be from Satoshi was the "auto increases over time", which wasn't in that post.

 No. First of all, the 20MB blocks would only be valid on top of all the blocks from now to the fork date.

You'd need 50% to do this. 




 Phased in, in context, means that clients that upgrade aren't immediately incompatible with older clients until a specific point is reached.

In other words, don't switch to bigger blocks until a delay. 




 Huh? Satoshi's proposal was just increasing to a new hard limit.

Tell me cops/FBI aren't sometimes untrustworthy, crooked, and famously fraternal, that media doesn't get it wrong like when they posted a front page picture of a high school athlete and his track coach under a screaming headline labeling them the Boston bombers.

Nothing I've said implies that the media don't get things wrong; I feel strongly the opposite of that view.

Give me a reason why lawyers, judges, cops themselves, constitutional rights organizations, and your mom last night say the smartest, safest action to take when you're in trouble with cops is never talk to cops.

There are several reasons, but this is irrelevant; the silence here was in an interview to the media, not to the police.

I don't hate cops (for reference, I full on hate you), but I won't put my trust in them to act in my interest.

 This is mentioned as a potential problem on the weaknesses page on the bitcoin wiki, and also links to a page on getting around the timestamp issue.

Go tell whoever wrote that they have no idea what they're talking about. 




 It's not going to be noticeable over the short term. There are sometimes hour-long gaps between blocks. One or two blocks generated at a slower rate won't set off anything.

I'm not the first to mention this vuln of only connecting to one node, I've seen devs saying similar. 




 The judge ruled otherwise. If Ross had claimed an interest in it, they might have needed to justify, but as it was Ross had the burden of proof and failed to meet it. 




 They don't have to justify it, contrary to your claim. The fact that they did is irrelevant.

My point then was whether they need to know the search is legal. 




 You said
 And they have to justify their authority to do so.

I saw what you said about third parties, I was bringing out a different point then. 




 Do you not understand the scenario I've been describing? I start with block X, generating blocks, then send them to you when I'm ready. The timestamps are after X.

You keep on adding new checks which nobody ever checks, and would be trivial to exploit if implemented in code. 




 You claim that they need to justify their authority to search, however it would seem the burden of proof is on the defendant that the search was illegal. 




 They might not, as I said, I'm unaware of case law dealing with that specific question.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Search

has

The Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to information that is voluntarily given to third parties.

but it's not clear whether the police need to *know* that it was given at the time of search. The government's argument would say no, because Ulbricht had no expectation of privacy for the server due to its violating ToS, so he can't throw evidence out.

http://www.wired.com/2014/10/feds-silk-road-hack-legal/ also says it might not be true that the Feds can search foreign property. 




 I generate them in advance, and only send them to you when you connect. 




 Yes, but they didn't search every server, only the server SR was on. 




  In order to mine blocks after X you have to have hashing power equal to the total hashing power of the bitcoin network at block X.

No, because you have more time. If you have 1%, then you can mine 1 block in 100*10 minutes on average.

Plus you have to continue to do this without falling significantly behind for an average of 1008 blocks (to next difficulty change).

I only need to do this for 1 or 2 blocks, however many confirms you'll require. 




 I'm giving you all the blocks up to X, plus two that I mined. This should be clear from my post. 




 Huh? Mine is exactly 98 blocks shorter than the real one.

Also, would you notice? 




  All I need to start is a copy of the genesis block hash -- any chain you give me can be verified to be the correct one from this genesis block.

Nope. I start a chain from block X, mine two blocks on it. Send it to you. This chain is X+2 blocks long.

The real chain has X + 100 confirms in the meantime. You don't see it, because you only connected to me.

You have the wrong chain. 




  Your argument is a straw man.

I wanted you to clarify what you meant, thanks.

From your original post it seemed like you think there's a duty to break laws not affecting you. 




 Or, don't enter a regulated market. Plenty of people have made quick money in non-regulated markets (e.g. Flappy Bird). 




 1. Do you think the law against possession of child p is unjust?
2. If the answer to 1 is yes, do you have any, and if not, how is that consistent with what you said above? 




  But to know that it violated the party's ToS, they'd have to have some reasonable suspicion (or whatever the nomenclature is).

They had freaking reasonable suspicion, it said on the site it sold drugs! (Technically they didn't know it was a third party until after they found it, so it may have been legal, but they couldn't have known until afterwards. So it would have been illegal (possibly) if it had been on his own server in the US. Whether that's valid is an interesting question, but I don't know if there's precedent.) 




 There are so many unjust laws out there. Why should I do the research it takes to break them? I bet you haven't broken every unjust law, either. 




 Parent was implying a pardon is wrong if he didn't break the law. 




 They didn't admit it until the trial.

I've seen a theory that Dratel didn't want to admit it until he had to, because that would reduce public support for Ross, which was paying his bills. 




 Actually no. The government claimed that they found the server legally. Ross challenged that, but refused to claim a personal interest in the server, so that was never ruled on. So as far as we know, it's possible it would have been ruled legal anyway.

(I think the government's argument was at least partially plausible; basically that it was outside the US, and handed over to a third party in violation of said party's ToS, and therefore didn't have 4th amendment rights.) 




 The murder for hire stuff was also on his computer, thus not editable by the agents who were corrupt. 




 The second of the ones I quoted, or

sabotage bitcoin by excluding clients and nodes

Sorry I was unclear.

I agree that if limits are set too high, then one small miner can do this. My system would allow anyone to bid for the blocksize, so it will be chosen by those who most want it, as in the Coase theorem. 




 You badly underestimate fools. 




 This started because someone said that you only needed to connect to them if you trust them, and you said trust is not required

I don't have to trust you -- the proof of work gives me trust. :)

You're right that if you connect to one good node then you'll end up with the right chain, but if you connect to only one node that isn't trustworthy, you have no guarantee that you'll be on the right chain. You can verify the chain, but you don't know if there's a bigger one out there. 




  If you have access to the internet, you could get access to a list of nodes.
 I'd imagine future clients will check for validity by comparing the responses from multiple nodes.

That doesn't help, unless you manually choose some nodes, and abort if you don't get a response from some of them. 




  and also the risk of a rogue miner using oversize blocks to knock competitors off the market, or sabotage bitcoin by excluding clients and nodes

The first of these is irrelevant to my system. The second can only be done by multiple miners colluding, in fact it requires 51%. 




 It doesn't really matter if you can iterate. 




 `x--` 




 It acts exactly like a function
of **it's** argument.

As someone who knows grammar, rekt. 




 But if you only connect to one node, then how do you know they don't have any hashpower? Your claim of no-trust needed is wrong. 




  And 5 minutes later someone adds a couple of blocks that includes the transaction mrEvil wanted to leave out. So you'd have to keep making a chain of only your blocks till the end of time to avoid that.

You only need to reject blocks with the transaction you wanted to exclude.

Which makes everyone else on the planet sooner or later stop using your chain, since its not distributed anymore and people will use the other 49%'s fork.

So you're saying a hardfork to stop this one chain. Everyone needs to upgrade, and anyone who didn't upgrade stays on my chain.

Also, in the time it takes, the attacker already successfully double-spent.

And this can be repeated, blocking any blocks that build on a competing fork, for as long as attacker has power. That builds an incentive to follow this attacker's proposed rules. 




  But the point is that standardization is not a "market". (Most things aren't.) There are no buyers and sellers, there is no item that gets traded and has a price.

It's not a perfect analogy to a market with fungible goods, but arguably markets don't need fungible goods (to take an example from the link above, selling dedications.) The buyer is anyone who burns, the seller is implicitly the entire bitcoin community, which gains because the float goes down. The item being traded is blocksize, with it automatically going to the highest bidder.

The purpose of a maximum block size limit (like the maximum size limit for internet packets) is to make it possible for each player to ensure before hand that he has enough resources to play his role. If the maximum block size is 1 MB, the admin of a site that needs to store 10000 blocks in memory knows that 20 GB of RAM will be more than enough. If the maximum block size is 20 MB, he had better get 200 GB, or program a more complicated solution with disk swaps or multiple servers. Now, what should he do if the maximum block size is computed from the traffic?

This may be a valid point, but note that "serious" proposals have been made with varying blocksizes as well. So some core devs don't seem to think that's a problem. 




  Having 51% allows no such thing, unless you are willing to compete with the rest of the network until the end of time, essentially forking it. Hoping that everyone will choose your more restrictive fork.

Your "restrictive" fork is longer than the other one, and is completely valid, therefore nodes will accept it. 














 Agreed, but it makes the above claim a lot less valid.

And there's still a chain of custody. 




 Roohparvar says the sleeves are thin enough to fit inside almost every battery compartment imaginable 




  A free market is not "anything can be sold". It is a market where there is no artificial barrier to the entry of new suppliers, suppliers can set the price of their product as they please, and customers can freely choose among suppliers.

That's not the meaning I was referencing. I'm talking about the idea that [If you may do it for free, you may do it for money.](http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2015/02/book-dedication-for-sale/) My (only partly in jest) claim was that the blocksize debate was not being conducted that way.

There's also the claim that the free market always works better than a non-free market.

Setting a common standard for products that have to interoperate -- like lamp and lamp sockets, power plugs and sockets, internet packet formats, character set encodings -- is not something that "free markets" are good at.

[citation needed]

(actually, since this is /r/bitcoin, even a citation won't be believed)

Whenever two computer systems have to share a database or exchange information, it is necessary to have a fixed maxmum size for items and messages.

This would still have a maximum size, just recalculated every so often, in a deterministic way. 




 But none of the "corrupt" agents had that access.

Do some research on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_custody 




 Are you saying you disagree? 









  OTOH Gavin has a point saying that a median always excludes the vote of the hash power minority.

I must have missed that. Link? 




 Buying paintings doesn't change the system. (And the money goes to others, who then spend it back into the economy. Not wasted.) 




  Having the most money means you can change the system to make sure you keep being the person with the most money sounds like a good idea to you?

Whoever controls 51% of mining can already control what is mined. The only thing about the system that could be changed under this plan is the blocksize. 




  Well, how about doing as Gavin proposed then, having the growing blocksize limit, BUT also making a very reasonable default adaptive soft limit, like 1.5x average since last 2016 blocks?

I've proposed this as well. You should use the median, not the mean, as someone pointed out.

I think more needs to be done on incentives, but that seems right.

Of course, [I prefer my own idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3863vw/a_brandnew_idea_for_resolving_the_blocksize_debate/) :) 




 There is no such thing as "almost surely guaranteed" in statistics.

Maybe I'm not the one who needs to study statistics more.
6 block in a row at some point.

But not starting from an arbitrary point. If I fork the blockchain starting from block X, 51% means I'll eventually be longer than the mainchain, while .01% means I most likely won't.

I can try forking anew whenever a new block is found, but that won't let me double-spend something from block X+1. 




 You've got an almost surely guarantee, or probability of 1, over unbounded time. 




 The logs on his computer couldn't be changed by someone with SR access. The journal, etc. 




 What do you think his appeal can be based on? 




 No. There's a petition site at whitehouse.gov, but change.org has no guarantee. 




 I think almost everyone will agree that he broke the law at this point. 




 The judge threw it out because he refused to claim a privacy interest in the server, which could not be used against him in court. 




 1. Make this on the whitehouse.gov website, if at all

 It's not only bandwidth, it's the UTXO set, which may grow a lot faster with larger blocks. 




 Just curious what you would consider a free market "anything can be sold" solution to this.

Or would actually using a burn address be enough? 




 But they need to waste it, not just give it to politicians. 




 FWIW, most of the sites I've used accepted a number other than 6.

And 51% is guaranteed in the long run. 




 It seems to be a definitional dispute over whether hardfork means network split or code change from a previously consistent state, and as the previous code was itself inconsistent, some aren't considering it a hardfok. Or maybe it's whether there's a protocol change or not?  




 So first of all, not everyone has a list of nodes like you do, and less nodes means less security for those.

Are you manually checking that you got valid responses from at least one known node, by the way?

Second, if everyone does like you, that puts the cost on those nodes even higher, leading to a disincentive for node to publicise their addresses. 




 That's a soft fork, I think. 




 Blocksize is sort of controlled like you say, but only if miners make a conscious decision. It's not as good a guarantee as the one against 50% attacks. 




 Your first point is very minor (no pun intended).

And a small miner must still verify a large block in order to mine on top of it; if they assume that others will be mining on it, they want to as well, but if it's large then they may not be able to store the blockchain anymore, or not have enough bandwidth for incremental changes. 




 6 is irrelevant to the attack.

And if you have less than 50%, you aren't guaranteed to suceed. 




 I've seen it said that bitcoin has never had a true hardfork; is that not true?

Edit: also, they seemed to be referring to when the limit was first introduced. 




 I'm on an i7, but I think it's in the 3s in GHz. Didn't time anything more than 5. 




 One of the agents (DEA agent Carl Mark Force) was the lead undercover agent in the case against Ulbricht, and had high-level access to administrative functions of the Silk Road, including the ability to manipulate logs, chats, private messages, posts, account information and bank accounts. 

And that somehow caused chat messages to appear on Ross's computer how exactly? 









 I like mine better. That one is both serious and unfree. They unfairly award more power to those with more money, without requiring them to pay it. That's not free markety at all! 




 There were no relevant hard-forks AFAIK, although there were some edge cases. 




 That was a soft fork. 




  Most scenarios predict that the winning fork is very quickly decided by market or other forces.

The last hard-fork caused by a bug took longer than "very quickly". 




 I'm thinking a new vote each retarget. However, if there's no opposition, then it takes very little to maintain/adjust. If there's opposition, then you need to outspend them.

(Perhaps there could be scripts as opposed to simply numbers, which would allow more freedom.)

The beauty of my idea is that it changes all future hard-forks to soft-forks; all miners just refuse to mine on ones with a bad vote, and nodes will **never** have to think about it again.  




 It worked for me, taking under a second for each result. 

for i in {1..5}; do echo xprv9wTYmMFdV23N21MM6dLNavSQV7Sj7meSPXx6AV5eTdqqGLjycVjb115Ec5LgRAXscPZgy5G4jQ9csyyZLN3PZLxoM1h3BoPuEJzsgeypdKj | bip32gen -i xprv -f - -o addr -F - $i; done

took 2 seconds to complete.

Try that, and if it works, then something's wrong with whatever key/code you copied. 




  How is the "huge block" problem any different than the 51% problem?

If you have less than 51%, you can't do a 51% attack (at least not with a certain chance of success). But any miner can start making huge blocks. 




 The problem is that some nodes will be hurt, and don't have the option to make these tradeoffs. 




  It would be great to have commitment that the core-devs and other stakeholders would abide by such a vote.

I was thinking that would be enforced by code. 




 And it's all done in the blockchain! 




 Just because it's hard doesn't mean we should make it even harder. There are real tradeoffs here, which you didn't acknowledge at all in your post. 




  We have full nodes surplus now, too many people are running full nodes. 

That is not true. The number of nodes has been dropping, and some core devs are concerned that it's going to be too low. 




 Disclaimer: this may or may not be serious; take it as you wish. If you do take it seriously, don't dismiss it as ridiculous. Conversely, if you think it's ridiculous, then it's probably satire.

As I'm sure you all know, there's been a debate recently over the blocksize. This is beginning to feel like politics. Bitcoin was made in order to subvert politics, so this is unfortunate.

The optimal solution for any problem whatsoever is a free market. This is proven by the [Coase theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem), as any good anarchist knows.

The reason this hasn't solved the blocksize problem is that it's not a free market. Shocking, right?

**My proposal**

Make the blocksize a free market. Specifically, designate one address the "blocksize voting address", and disable spending any outputs to it. People can send any amount of bitcoin to this address, which effectively "burns" it. In such a transaction, also include an OP_RETURN with a number, which is your vote for the blocksize in bytes. These are averaged out every difficulty retarget, weighted by how much money was voted for them, and that is the new blocksize.

(I've tentatively selected an address for this: 1SizeQWexshCicTnfPmYESiAymjHyBXKX.)

Note that miners can reject transactions that have blocksize votes they don't want, so 51% of miners can easily collude to block voters they don't like. However, those voters can in turn make the fees to the miners high enough, which perfectly aligns incentives (ah, the magic words).

I had some buzzwords to put here, but I forgot, so pretend there was more things that you like about bitcoin here. 




  Then bitcoin must have been really big, really important. 

Or someone just spammed a lot.

Besides, nodes don't make money. 




  How can I verify that the child addresses are connected to the master key?

You can also print out the private keys by changing `addr` to `wif` and check that those generate those addresses. I'm not sure how else you want to verify.

 And what kind of wallet do I need to spend the bitcoins sent to these child addresses?

Any wallet that allows adding private keys. I don't have any wallet recommendations. Is the code good? 




  It suggests that my equipment is not catching up, and i'm not suitable to run a full node while other people and business can (they are forwarding it).

And when it costs a million dollars to run a full node due to large storage/ bandwidth requirements what will you do? 




 You spelled the fictional character wrong. 




 You aren't blocked, ergo the West is good. 




  then i have to accept that - that's what people want.

and then your node crashes because the block is too big.

Your claim that it only affects you if you want it to is false. 




 You can set your own soft limit and stop forward blocks bigger than that.

If you reject all blocks above a certain size, and others don't, you are breaking consensus.

You can't stay on the network without accepting everything other blocks do. 




  Not if I connect to specific nodes I trust along with other random nodes on the network.

They can also be targeted, though. And a situation where you need to distrust almost all nodes you don't know or aren't public isn't ideal, to say the least. 




 * Download https://github.com/jmcorgan/bip32utils `git clone https://github.com/jmcorgan/bip32utils`
* Run `cd bip32utils`
* Run `sudo python setup.py install`
* Run `for i in {1..1000000}; do echo xprvyourkeyhere | bip32gen -i xprv -f - -o addr -F - $i; done`

Tested in ubuntu and bash.

If you need the private keys, just change `addr` above to `wif`.

Changetip will be fine. 




 virwox.com, if you have a Paypal Mastercard you can use circle.com or coin.mx 




 But these all sound to me like issues that affect some, but not others. So it seems to me like it ought to be a configurable setting.

I can't opt out from the network if I run a full node. 




  Are you confusing nodes with miners? Having control of half of all nodes isn't some sort of magical number that'll allow you to do whatever you like. All it takes is one node to distribute a longer chain and it'll be accepted by all other legitimate nodes.

But you don't connect to all nodes. You only connect to some subset, and if I control half of all nodes you're likely to only connect to mine.

If I'm connected to several nodes that I trust, the likelihood that someone is going to compromise all of those nodes simply to double-spend against me seems lower than my chance at winning the lottery having never bought a ticket.

If running a node costs a lot, then you may not *know* people that run one. I personally probably know exactly 0 people who run nodes. 




 So if I'm responsible for $15 million of damage I don't owe any explanation, but if it's half a billion I do? 




 https://archive.is/LOBq3 




 Shouldn't you be in jail? 




 $15 million 




 If I've got any significant hashpower, I can convince you that I've sent you bitcoin with many confirms no matter where you start from.

I can also convince you that the chain is much smaller than it is without doing any work. 




 Sony getting hacked caused lots of damage, it was evaluated in the millions. 




 If you only visit a single node? Nope. 




 And if the network was reduced to only a handful of nodes, I imagine all of them would have public addresses. If you can connect to each of them, query for the same information, and get the same answer, is there any reason not to trust that answer?

It means that an attacker only needs to compromise a couple of nodes. It's less centralization.

Also, imagine there are 20,000 nodes. To be half the node network, you'd need 20,000 nodes of your own, and would need a lot of IP addresses.

But if there are only 25 nodes, then anyone can make another 25 nodes and be half the network. They can make 100 nodes with unique IPs, and be the vast majority.

Is this the only danger to worry about? That you might not have the longest chain? What issues could result of this?

It means someone could double spend. I send you chain X with a payment from me to you, so now you think you've been paid. The real chain Y already spent that payment somewhere else.

There's also a standard double-spend attack with preventing you from seeing the double-spend, but that only matters if you accept zero-confs. Even so, less nodes makes it easier to block.

Also, lower nodes means easier to censor, and harder to get cheap anonymity. 




 something reasonable such as 21 mb

If only everyone agreed that was reasonable ... 




 How many transactions do you do a day, how much do you pay in fees, and which currency would you switch to? You haven't provided enough info to be meaningful. 




 If you run your own node, then you have the full security of bitcoin as long as at least one node you connect to is honest. You can only be "fooled" into accepting a shorter chain if nobody that has the longer one can communicate with you. Also, if the fake chain is a lot shorter than the correct one, it will likely have very long gaps in between blocks, or the latest block will be far in the past, increasing suspicion.

If there are few nodes, then it's easier for someone to ensure that you connect only to them. 




 Nice try, Chinese. 




 http://lesswrong.com/lw/f1/beware_trivial_inconveniences/

The Great Firewall of China. A massive system of centralized censorship purging the Chinese version of the Internet of all potentially subversive content. Generally agreed to be a great technical achievement and political success even by the vast majority of people who find it morally abhorrent.

I spent a few days in China. I got around it at the Internet cafe by using a free online proxy. Actual Chinese people have dozens of ways of getting around it with a minimum of technical knowledge or just the ability to read some instructions.

The Chinese government isn't losing any sleep over this (although they also don't lose any sleep over murdering political dissidents, so maybe they're just very sound sleepers). Their theory is that by making it a little inconvenient and time-consuming to view subversive sites, they will discourage casual exploration. No one will bother to circumvent it unless they already seriously distrust the Chinese government and are specifically looking for foreign websites, and these people probably know what the foreign websites are going to say anyway.

 You shouldn't be reusing addresses [anyway](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse).

You could just send away any coins on that address first before doing this.

(Also, the fact that you have other unspent transactions in the same address will make the procedure described above more complicated.) 




 You said it's a few dollars for a test.

But if you don't trust it, first generate the list of transactions using only your public address. Then, save the html file, go offline, generate the actual transaction, and save that. Then you can test it on blockchain.info before uploading it. That way, your private key is never entered while you're online.

You can't do it completely online because it needs to pull your transaction history. (By the way, I confirmed that transactions still pending are included on the list, so you can double spend with it.) 




 If you want to test it again I'll "help" you ... 




 Well, I knew immediately that the only hope to recover the funds is that a legit mining pool that has a policy for returning funds in such circumstances and that I can contact, mines the transaction.

You could also have quickly made another transaction and hoped the second went through (not very likely though). 




 404 




 User wallets won't let you double spend in general. You'll need to create the transaction manually, then broadcast it.

Assuming you have the private key:

1. Go to https://brainwallet.org/#tx

2. Paste in the private key

3. Put in the destination address

4. Put in the amount you want to send. This should be less than the total, to include a fee.

5. Copy the raw transaction, go to https://blockchain.info/pushtx, and paste.

 No no, you misunderstood. OP wants *more* threads, not less.

(I think the number of threads should dynamically increase with the number of people not paying attention; this makes an incentive for people to read them so that more aren't created.) 




 The increase of the block size should be dynamically adjust and it will be a benefit for both the normal user(faster confirmation speed)

No, that only applies if the blocks are full. 




 I'd recommend doing this with any site; I've been burned too many times by even so-called highly regarded sites.

Put it this way: have you ever seen an article from any mainstream source on something you knew a lot about, and found it completely accurate? I haven't, and many people have said the same. 




 What was stupid about what they did?

(In case you weren't aware, it was an app that stored private keys on the user's device, and had a problematic way to generate entropy. If you call anyone using the app stupid for not going through every line of source code themselves, including all of Android's source code, which was part of the bug, then you're setting a very high barrier which I highly doubt even you use. Or have you read the entire code of any wallet you use, plus any operating system it runs on?)
