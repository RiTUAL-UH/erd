 Other than 'God bless you', or 'bless you', what is a good post sneeze saying?

Could be popular or original. Witty or humorous. Something out of the ordinary.

Does anybody have a go to phrase? 

























































































 I am biased, because my league gives points for KR yardage, and he has been doing quite well for me thus far. I have seen many people eager to drop him after tonights weak offensive performance and subsequent injury. If not currently starting caliber, would he not be worth at least a spot on most benches due to his speed and breakout potential once Bridgewater returns and/or the Vikings get their offensive shit together?

Also does anybody have any additional information on the status of his hip injury?

I've heard some good things about this kid. What is the inside scoop? 









 I have read many creepy things about certain parts of Black Mountain in Queensland (South of Cooktown), including the disappearance of many people and animals which venture to the rocks. Most notable is Yirrmbal, which is said to be considered "taboo" among the locals.

As an outsider, I am very curious to hear the locals take on the area. Any personal stories, local legends, friend-of-a-friend accounts, or recent strange experiences would be greatly appreciated.

Let's get weird.

 Date of Post: 5/22/2014

Date of Event: 5/11/2014

"I was asleep. I woke up with a need to go outside. I went out, there was a light shining on a rock. I touched the rock and was given a vision. I've never had visions, I'm not mentally ill and not even interested in this and certainly won't talk about it. I've been married to a narcotics detective twenty years with two teenage boys. I'm not a sceptic or a believer to this point. When I touched this rock within 30 seconds I was given thousands of years of history of how "aliens" were here many thousand years ago and what they are doing. I was given information that a planet knew many thousand years ago their planets Sun would die. They wanted to make a new home. They found our planet they found out conditions were comparable to them. They have decided they didn't want to do the necessary things that need done to make the planet functional for them. They showed pictures of different species to develop the planet they experimented with. They showed me the help they have given along the way. They need certain things mined built and ready for them. They have given certain scientists and others knowledge the way it was given to me. They gave us religion so we work together because ants work well together, bees work well together but they had to make us more advanced to get us to work together, religion. They have given us the ability to understand how to process DNA but only the knowledge to use it minimally. They gave us fear of criminals and criminal elements so eventually the world will have every humans DNA filed from birth. They are able to read which of the humans by that they will keep when they come. I'm not religious per say but the rapture as we understand it is somewhat true but based on our genes. Almost like whatever people they need to further them will be used. They have astronauts kind of like we do that intervene if necessary, but it would have taken them too many resources to prepare our planet, that's why we are here and they give us motivations to go in the direction they want. They need mercury gold other metals. They need computers much more sophisticated than what we have, we are laying their groundwork. They will live in harmony with us to the best of their ability when they come,but not everyone will benefit the society. That's why we have been given DNA knowledge. I can't write everything I was shown it would take forever. But the information was given to me in thirty seconds. I don't know why ME, I'm nobody just a mother disabled with lupus. I spent 8 years in army reserves as supply specialist ages ago. There is absolutely nothing extraordinary about me. The light was a v shape the size of a small plane. The beam that came down was like a laser beam and I could do nothing but walk to where it shone and touch it. It didn't hurt it felt like nothing, but in the 30 seconds I was there I was given 3 lifetimes of information. It was specific it was visual and I retained it. I don't want to ever tell anyone this because they will think I'm nuts. I would think they were nuts. But I thought someone should have this knowledge,nd your the only people on the Yahoo I could see to tell. It's not like I can call the president and tell him.
Anyway I wish there was a way I could give you all the things I learned, but I'm a busy mom and don't want to be responsible for this information, I really just want to forget it but my brain keeps putting it back no matter what else I try to think about. So I'm hoping I told you it will be over. A lot of the information I was given I don't even understand. But cave people were not the first people. We have been started over on more than one occasion. They have to be careful we have enough information to advance the planet where they want it but not too much where we blow our planet up and ruin it. They are walking a tightrope of sorts and not even as 'll them always agree and we are a work in progress.
Thank you for taking this information, hopefully it's not mine anymore.

 If you are passionate about e-cigarettes, and more importantly freedom of choice, I urge you to boycott the Vuze brand, which is owned by RJ Reynolds. 

If you haven't yet heard, RJ Reynolds has recently typed up a 120 page report, which it then sent on to the FDA, urging them to make all open air mods illegal. Open air mods include any type of e-cigarette that can be re-filled by the user with the e-liquid of their choice.
 
The report is filled with bullshit reasoning including that open air mods are more dangerous and more easily accessible to children. That's right, one of the leading cigarette manufactures in the world is claiming that open air mods are dangerous and should be made illegal. Ironic that RJ Reynolds has suddenly formed a conscience, isn't it?

Not surprisingly, closed air e-cigarettes such as Blu and Vuze are not mentioned in this write up. 

In reality, this is a blatant attempt by RJ Reynolds to force their main competition out of the market by attempting to sway the FDA with sensationalized pseudo-facts and industry clout. Criminalizing open air mods would in effect give RJ Reynolds a near monopoly in the US e-cig market, forcing consumers who have decided to quit tobacco cigarettes into buying RJ Reynolds e-cig products and continuous cartridge refills. 

I urge all of you who are passionate about this innovative and emerging market to show RJ Reynolds that we will not stand for corrupt politics and business practices.

People are quitting tobacco cigarettes at an astounding rate, and RJ Reynolds is desperate to keep their hands in our pockets. 

Not to mention, I bought a Vuze before i found out about their letter to the FDA and it absolutely SUCKED. Worst e-cig product I have ever had the displeasure of using.

**Take a stand against blatant corruption. Boycott Vuze and all RJ Reynolds products, companies, and subsidiaries.**

 In regard to *hypothetically* seeking employment/potential upcoming drug test.

If you smoked 1 hit /day for a month, as opposed to smoking 4-5 bowls with a group (lets say on average 3 hits per bowl) each day for a month, approximately how long would it take each person to piss clean for a drug test. Would it be the same? Or would the 1 hit method have an advantage?

Lets assume the standard 30 days no smoking to be safe for the 4-5 bowl smoker. I guess the question would be, if somebody only smokes 1 hit per day for a 30 day cycle, is there any advantage in being able to quit smoking maybe a couple of weeks before the test as opposed to the standard 30 days? 









 I have an original CDV (Carte de Visite) photograph of a particularly famous gentleman from the Civil War era. His name is Owen Lovejoy, and he was a congressman, judge, Underground Railroad Conductor, and good friend of Abraham Lincoln. He helped introduce the final slavery ending bill to Congress.

My CDV is also signed on the front. The signature reads "Hon. Owen Lovejoy". The only place I have been able to find an original example of this CDV is in the NYPL (New York Public Library) Digital Gallery here;

+ http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchdetail.cfm?strucID=136488 imageID=115768

This is the exact CDV i have, only the one I have possesses a signature.
 
I believe this is his most famous image, and also the one Wikipedia uses as their main photo, here;

+ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Lovejoy

The photographer is J. Gurney   Son, located at 707 Broadway, New York.

From the NYPL write up, I was able to determine that this photo was part of this collection: "The Pageant of America" Collection / v.8 - Builders of the Republic / (unpublished photographs) / Portraits

That is where the trail ends, as I have been unable to find any other relevant information on this specific photograph, nor could I find much on the Pageant of America collection in general.

The CDV i possess was found in a civil war era photo album and dates somewhere between 1840-1870, I believe.

Is there anybody in this sub who could possibly provide me with more information on this particular CDV such as it's scarcity or possible historical value?

Finally, here are front and back photos of my CDV:

 Firstly, let me say that my condolences go out to the family members of the missing crew and passengers on MH370.

Secondly, I would like to clarify that the following analysis is a THEORY of mine, and while SPECULATION, it is based on known facts and inference relating to the events that transpired since lost radio contact. Trolls are not welcome here, constructive comments only.

I have been following the emerging details of this case very closely since the initial incident. From early on, I have maintained that this was no accident, and either the pilot(s) or separate hijackers were involved in this planes calculated disappearance. The evidence that has emerged since then has only served to strengthen my initial hypothesis.

**Here how I think it went down...**

+ After takeoff, before MH370 reaches the East Coast of Malaysia, the ACARS system is manually turned off by one of the pilots in the cabin.

+ After crossing into the Gulf, before reaching Vietnam, Malaysia air control contacts MH370, informing them that they are about to enter Vietnamese airspace, and their air traffic controllers will soon be taking over communications. The time is aprox. 1:30 am, it is at this time the co-pilot says "Ok. Goodnight" to Malaysian air traffic controllers. (Notice the nonchalant 'goodnight' *AFTER* the ACARS is turned off, indicating it was not done under duress.) **This is the last successful radio contact with MH370**

+ Pilot manually switches off the transponder signal, which now joins the ACARS as being disabled.

+ It is at this point that I believe the pilot(s) manually initiated a leak in the cabin's air pressure control system, slowly depressurizing the cabin. To those passengers inside the cabin, they would not know anything is wrong, and would slowly become drowsy with gradual oxygen loss. 

+ 5 minutes after last radio contact, at roughly 1:35 am, the plane is said to ascend to approx. 45,000 feet. **Keep in mind, this is above the planes service ceiling and this maneuver would never be done under normal circumstances, as there is a chance the plane could stall.** I believe that coupled with the manual cabin depressurization, this move was performed in order to kill the passengers on board. 

+ Following this maneuver, the plane is said to make a sharp turn to the west, coupled with a rapid decent to around 20,000 feet. (In my opinion, this erratic decent could have been planned to make it appear to radar operators as if there was a cockpit struggle taking place. It could also be a result of a stall or near-stall.)

+ When the plane never reaches Vietnamese airspace, and radio contact cannot be made with MH370, ground control contacts a separate airplane to attempt radio contact with MH370. The pilot reports back that he could only hear mumbling, static, and interference coming from MH370's end. **I believe this is consistent with the pilot(s)wearing his oxygen mask(s), after depressurizing the plane.**

+ At this point the plane flies west, back over Malaysia, and follows known aviation waypoints through the Strait of Malacca, toward the Indian Ocean. The movements of the plane coupled with the following of known waypoints indicates an experienced and current pilot being in control of MH370.

+ The plane continues to be pinged for up to 7 hours after initial lost radio contact. This indicates that the plane is still flying, as a crashed plane or one that has landed and been "shut off" will not ping.

+ 8:11 am, over 6 hours after last radio contact, satellite ping information puts the plane on the perimeter of a half circle, either west of Australia, or west of China. (The exact location is not known from the ping, just a general distance from the satellite.) *It is my belief that the plane headed south toward Australia, as a northerly route would take it directly over many countries whose air defense / radar systems would have surely picked it up.*

**I DO NOT BELIEVE THE PLANE CRASHED! It is my belief that this plane was taken, for use at a later date, in some sort of 9/11-esque plot. It is not my belief that Zaharie was the mastermind behind this plot, rather just the executor of this particular stage.**

+ I believe the plane may have been landed in Australia, Indonesia, or somewhere close to where it was last determined to be located on the southerly track of the 8:11 am ping. After landing, the plane will be immediately painted over and 're-branded' so to speak. The transponders will be swapped/updated, and the plane will essentially be ready to fly again with no links to MH370.

+ NOTE ZAHARIE'S FLIGHT SIMULATOR. In a recent interview with CNN, a close friend of Zaharie's says the simulator can be programmed with custom scenarios. **It is my belief that Zaharie may have practiced this particular flight many many times, in preparation. This would also afford him the knowledge of how far he could fly on a given amt. of fuel.**

+ It has been reported that Zaharie's family moved out of their house the day before the flight went missing. Zaharie is also said to be a 'political fanatic', whose idol Anwar Ibrahim, was just convicted of sodomy and sentenced to 5 years in prison, **one day before MH370 went missing**. This conviction is being viewed by many Malaysians as political persecution, and Zaharie allegedly expressed his disgust at the verdict.

+ Recently, a credible threat is investigated after Al-Qaeda supergrass told court that four or five Malaysian men planned a passenger airliner hijack. According to the Al-Qaeda member, **ONE OF THOSE MEN IS A MALAYSIAN PILOT.** http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/10700652/Malaysia-Airline-MH370-911-style-terror-allegations-resurface-in-case-of-lost-plane.html

+ It is clear to me, and anybody in the know, that humans played a direct roll in this planes disappearance. This can be inferred by the intelligent movements made by the plane and the specific tracking features that were manually disabled. While I cannot rule out the possibility of hijackers gaining control of the cockpit, the circumstances and timing of this event lead me toward believing one or both of the pilots were directly involved. **THIS WAS NOT CATASTROPHIC SYSTEMS FAILURE. THIS WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT. THIS WAS A WELL EXECUTED PLAN, THAT LIKELY TOOK YEARS TO DESIGN.**

+ I do not think this was a pilot suicide. The plane is said to intentionally avoid radar installations and detection once crossing into the Straight of Malacca. There is no reason for a pilot to strategically fly 7 hours off course, just to crash the plane in a more remote section of ocean.

+ From the moment of the plane's last radio contact, everything about this case signifies detailed and well thought out planning, even down to the time of morning this occurred. I believe these events were perpetrated at this hour because it would give them the most time to get away and cover their tracks. The plane was not even reported missing until 6-7 hours after last radio contact, and even then, Malaysian authorities made it seem like the plane had crashed.

In conclusion, unfortunately, I think this event is just the first stage of a much larger plan. I do not think we have seen the last of MH370. I really hope I am wrong. 

EDIT: Or they could just find the plane in the ocean... or at least a piece of wreckage linking to a 777. Then the truth should be in the black boxes. But if nothing at all is found wreckage wise, I'd be concerned.

EDIT 2: Updated for new information.

TL; DR - The plane didn't crash. I believe it may have landed for use in future terrorist activities.

Tell HN: Meeting Satoshi

163 points by yuxt 10 hours ago | 98 comments

back in 2011 I convinced my wife who ran a small creperie in DUMBO, Brooklyn to start accepting bitcoins. We were one of the first in the world physical location that accepted this new digital currency [1]. In the next couple of month we received a lot of attention, but no one has purchased anything with btc. Then one day, my wife calls me and informs that there is someone who would like to pay with bitcoins. I got excited and asked her to take a picture of the guy because he is the first one and it's a historic moment for us. He bought 2 crepes and paid using his smartphone and our QR code with btc address. One crepe and a lemonade was 1 bitcoin at that time :)
After he finished his food my wife approached him and asked to take a picture of him for being the first. He blushed and politely declined citing that bitcoin is an anonymous currency. He wished us well, added that bitcoins should already be in our account and left.

My wife called me back and revealed that he refused to take a picture. So I asked her to describe him. She portrayed the guy as a humble polite Japanese man in his 50s. We joked maybe it was Satoshi, but I dismissed the idea. I assumed it was some one from Mt Gox since it was located in Japan.

Today I showed the picture of Satoshi in Newsweek to my wife and she recognized him.

Let's say you were to enter starvation mode, and your body needed to burn stored fat for energy. Would the oldest fat in your body be burned first (FIFO)? Or would the newest accumulated fat be burnt first (LIFO)?

 http://fox43.com/2013/01/09/state-senator-proposes-legalizing-marijuana-in-pennsylvania/#axzz2qr1Lltmn

Here is Leachs letter on the subject:

"This past November, the people of Washington State and Colorado voted to fully legalize marijuana. Other places, including California, have had de facto legalization for some time. This week, I will introduce legislation which would have Pennsylvania join these other states in ending this modern-day prohibition. My bill will legalize the consumption of marijuana for adults over the age of twenty one, without regard to the purpose of that consumption. Heres why:

For the past 75 years, our marijuana policy has been foolish, ill-conceived, costly and destructive, and it must end.  We have been waging a war on drugs that includes treating the use of Marijuana as a matter for the criminal justice system. We have spent billions of dollars investigating, prosecuting, incarcerating and monitoring millions of our fellow citizens who have hurt no one, damaged no property, breached no peace. Their only crime was smoking a plant which made them feel a bit giddy.

People across our Commonwealth have spent time in prison, lost time at work, been forced to hire lawyers and had their lives disrupted and sometimes destroyed because they used a product less dangerous than beer, less risky than childrens cough syrup, less addictive than chocolate and whose societal harm comes from its prohibition rather than its use.

According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, in 2006, an average year, 24,685 marijuana arrests were made in Pennsylvania at a cost to the taxpayers of $325.36 million. Each year we not only waste a similar amount, we leave several hundred million dollars on the table in taxes that we do not collect because marijuana is illegal, rather than regulated and taxed. Aside from the moral issues involved, we simply can no longer afford the financial costs of prohibition.

Further, prohibition of marijuana has done what it did in the case of alcohol in the 1930s. It has created a dangerous black market with violent and bloody turf wars that kill many people in our country and elsewhere. The original prohibition brought us the St. Valentines Day Massacre. The modern prohibition has brought us gun battles in the streets between drug cartels. The murders associated with the sale of alcohol ended with prohibition. The same will be true of marijuana.

To be clear, under the terms of this legislation marijuana would be a regulated product, treated in a way similar to how alcohol is treated. It will still be illegal to drive under the influence of marijuana, behave badly while publicly intoxicated or to sell it to minors.

Further, like alcohol, legalization and regulation will make marijuana safer.  People will no longer have to buy it on the streets from criminals who may have laced their product with other dangerous drugs. People buying legally will know exactly what they are getting and be able to rely on the safety of what they are purchasing.

The sad history of prohibition is that marijuana was legal, and in fact the most prescribed drug in that nation until the late 1930s. At that time, it was targeted by those who had an economic interest in removing it from the market. Today, prohibition is supported by myths, misconceptions and old wives tales that no longer stand up to scientific scrutiny.

For example, in response to my bill, Governor Corbett said he opposed it because he believes marijuana is a gateway drug. But science has clearly established that this is untrue. Well over 90 percent of those who use marijuana never go on to use harder drugs, and the percentage of people who do use hard drugs and had previously used marijuana is no higher than the percentage who had previously only tried beer.

The facts are that unlike alcohol, you simply cannot overdose on marijuana. Unlike alcohol and tobacco, marijuana is not physically addictive. Studies have shown that people on marijuana are much less likely to behave violently or recklessly than people who are drunk. And while breathing a hot gas into your lungs certainly isnt good for them, marijuana smokers on average smoke far less often than tobacco smokers. There is simply no way that marijuana does, or ever can, come close to killing the 1,100 people per day that tobacco does.

Yet despite all of this, you can drink and smoke tobacco freely. But if you smoke marijuana, you are a criminal and can go to jail. This horrific policy must end. People around the nation are realizing that. And it is a moral imperative that Pennsylvania wake up and end prohibition now." 














 Let me preface this by saying that I do not know much about cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, other than the basics.

But in regard to the marijuana industry's current issue with banks..

http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/us/banks-say-no-to-marijuana-money-legal-or-not.html?_r=0

Would it be at all feasible to create a cryptocurrency, Potcoin for example, and use that currency exclusively within the marijuana industry as a means of storing/investing/transferring money?

If that is not realistic, wouldn't a partnering of Bitcoin and the marijuana industry as it expands from state to state be a great idea for both parties?

What are your thoughts? 









 Since grabbing the KC Chiefs D/ST off the FA wire after week 1, the Seattle Seahawks D/ST has unfortunately been left sitting unused on my bench.

I am wondering what sort of trade value i should put on the Seahawks D/ST, if I were to attempt and move them straight up. Give me some examples of players at any position who would have a comparable value.

I like having the Seahawks D/ST on my bench, giving me the option of rotating the position on a weekly basis dependent on match-ups, however up until this point, I have started the Chiefs D each week (rightfully so) and feel like I may be wasting significant trade value which could be used to improve my starting lineup.

Should I keep the top 2 D's on my squad?

 But what if a little bit of the ice has melted, creating some liquid water? Does that make the whole bottle illegal? Or will they make you dump out the tiny bit of liquid water at the top of the bottle? What if the liquid water has formed on the bottom of the bottle, under the ice, and cannot be poured out? 

Will they take you in the back room and touch your b-hole for attempting to circumvent the rules with your snarky "frozen water" is not "liquid water" tirade?

 Funny thing is you would probably do the same thing if you were locked in some aliens cage, and they were constantly staring at you from a far. Pointing. Mocking you.

 Disregard the ignorance. I'm with you, buddy. 

People demand solid evidence when you bring up the topic of extraterrestrials visiting our planet, but fail to consider that the U.S. and other governments keep this subject classified at a level so high that only the top of the top has access to the information. In the past not even the President has been briefed on the subject unless in a "need to know" situation. People who come up with credible "proof" in the form of photograph/video have their original files confiscated or mysteriously lost or stolen. If their material does not go missing, they are threatened to keep quiet or face federal charges. In extreme cases, agents threaten physical harm to the leaker or their family if they choose to continue publicizing their story. On top of all that, there is an active disinformation campaign taking place serving to overload the public with bullshit/hoaxes/fake stories and sighting reports so that when something legitimate does come up, it will not be taken seriously and lumped in with the rest of the garbage. The topic of aliens is constantly met with laughs and jokes, *not because it is so improbable*, but because that's how we've been conditioned as a society to act toward the subject.

Acknowledging that aliens with a higher intelligence are visiting this planet would essentially brand all the governments of the world obsolete and irrelevant. Even more so when you take into account that they most likely do not know why the visitors are here and are powerless to stop them even if they deemed it necessary.

 Therapy, Frank. Seek it.  




 I think someone jizzed in his Farina.  




 I think it all depends on what "version" of God you are thinking about. I don't buy into any of the organized religions, and recognize too many inconsistencies and oxymorons in their teachings. With that being said, I cannot confirm or deny that some form of ultimate creator does or doesn't exist. If some sort of grand architect were to exist, I don't know the specific abilities he may or may not possess. 

Furthermore *what if* **our** creator didn't create the universe entirely? Being that he created us, would he still be considered our God? Or is that term expressly used to describe the finite ultimate intelligence that created everything in existance as we know it?

Where did God come from? Who created it? What existed before God? What is God?  




 So how many people have been killed over the past ~10 years by not globally transitioning from a fossil fuel reliance into fully funded and widespread use of renewable, clean, and alternative energies? 




 True, good points. Any specific reason why you chose to go with a wooden spoon as opposed to just a spoon in general? 




 Well, I mean, *if* God exists, you technically put *yourself* in Hell by not having faith in him during your life and following his teachings to the letter. Maybe it's not so much actually "sending" you to Hell as it is saying you aren't allowed into his Heaven (he has the right to choose, it's his, he created it) because you didn't obey his wishes, and the only alternative to Heaven is a dimension controlled by Satan (Hell).

 Not really, because smoking weed changes your metabolic rate and subsequent digestion process. When you smoke for a long time, you develop a consistent pattern in that process. When you stop smoking, your body is essentially just correcting back to normal.
 




 That's not a withdrawl symptom, its just an adjustment to your bodys metabolic rate and subsequent digestion schedule.

 LOUD NOISES 




 I think technically, if you read the article, they are trying to say that fracking *has not caused widespread damage to the US water supply, and does not pose a threat to do so in the future*. They are saying there have only been a small number of localized contamination issues around certain drill sites. 

Personally I think it is all complete bullshit (politics/money), and there is no doubt that fracking causes major groundwater contamination. There is no reason to believe that this contamination and these chemicals being pumped into the ground will not eventually make their way into larger water sources. 

Simply put; The EPA is bought and sold. This conclusion and article title are both bullshit. This report cannot be trusted and you should probably actually assume the direct opposite of what it's telling you.

 Yes. I think there is potential for treatment regarding those diseases, among many many others. On the reveres side, some people say that long term exposure to weed tends to increase the likelihood of developing illnesses such as anxiety and schizophrenia, among other types of psychosis. I think a lot of it is based on genetics. Furthermore, i think there needs to be exponentially more unbiased and regulated studies into the potential medicinal and psychological benefits of marijuana as well as those regarding the potential long term detrimental side-effects. 

I have a personal belief that marijuana has tremendous medicinal and psychological potential. But big pharma can't exactly profit off of a plant that anybody can grow in their basement, which is probably 50+% the reason why it remains illegal.

 Hey man, IDK if I can help or not, but I consider myself to be a day sleeper by nature. I just prefer to be awake at night but I can adapt myself to either cycle. 

When sleeping during the day, the most important thing is covering your eyes or eliminating the light source to the room. I will put a headband around my eyes, or the sleeve of a sweatshirt, or a pillow, whatever it takes to block out the light. Also if possible try to get some good shades on the windows.

Next step is, obviously, you have to be tired. To accomplish this, try and pull an all-nighter so that you've been awake for 24 hours. You will notice that you will sort of get a second wind for night 2 and when it comes time for you to sleep, you'll be tired enough to make it happen.

Then it's all about holding that schedule and after a little bit, your body's clock will sync up to compensate.  




 Because of the specific capabilities of their data capturing programs, they can and will essentially monitor EVERYTHING all at once. Don't think of it as individual NSA employees wasting their time monitoring a forum, think of it as a massive data center that basically captures ALL information as it passes through whatever wires/communication hub they are tapping. 

They can then use an algorithm to scan for certain keywords (could be a short list or a very long list) that they deem "ideologically dangerous" or "a threat to national security". All of those instances that the computer algorithm red flags can THEN be investigated by a person in greater detail. They know everything about you. Your patterns, your habits, where you go every day of your life, who you interact with, the foods you eat, the products you buy. You can easily be profiled based on your bank card spending/location data, phone content/location data, and internet browsing habits alone.

Your life history (and basically everyone elses) is on file for future reference. 

Like it or not, if you say certain words or phrases over the phone/internet, or express a pattern of certain behavior that they don't like, you will be on one of their lists.

Where as if the employee in question is fired due to negligence on their part, the employer would not be liable for such a claim.

 The Buzzer. Most agree that it's Russian military, most likely used to communicate with their spies in other countries, by sending coded messages which can be deciphered through the use of a one-time number pad. Could possibly also be related to troop and/or nuclear arsenal movement etc. 

If this topic interests you, be sure to check out /r/numberstations.

Here is an interesting excerpt from the wiki article:

**Unusual transmissions**

"Frequently, distant conversations and other background noises have been heard behind the buzzer, suggesting that the buzzing tones are not generated internally, but are transmitted from a device placed behind a live and constantly open microphone. It is also possible that a microphone may have been turned on accidentally.[17] One such occasion was on November 3, 2001, when a conversation in Russian was heard:[4]

"  143.   ." "    ." ("I am 143. Not receiving the generator (oscillator)." "That stuff comes from hardware room.").[18]

On November 11, 2010, intermittent phone conversations were transmitted and were recorded by a listener (at 1400 UTC) for a period of approximately 30 minutes. These conversations are available online, and seem to be in Russian.[19][20] The phone calls mentioned the "brigade operative officer on duty", the communication nodes "Debut", "Nadezhda" (Russian for "hope", both a noun and a female name), "Sudak" (a kind of river fish and also a town in Crimea) and "Vulkan" (volcano). The female voice says "officer on duty of communication node Debut senior ensign Uspenskaya, got the control call from Nadezhda OK"."

 It's not that I feel personally inconvenienced, although it is certainly a rights issue. I have been able to smoke freely for 10+ years without catching any court cases. It's the general empathy I share with other people who *are* caught up in the system and those who are having their lives ruined by these unjust and unethical laws and policies. 

It is my belief that they're coming down so hard on this woman, not really because of the cannabis oil possession, but because she was successful at *treating her cancer* with the procedure.

Instead, she is aimed to be locked up and made an example of because there is no profit to be made from marijuana being that it can be easily cultivated by anyone.

 Good advice. I've been puffing on this concoction for probably 2 weeks. I still can't see myself ever getting tired of it, it is just so flavorful, exactly like eating a grape skittle. I have read countless reviews of juice tasting "exactly" like something but upon trying it myself, I will always find some miniscule flavor out of place. This is the first juice i have tried with a taste so seamlessly integrated to the flavor they are attempting to emulate.  




 The company is called Preferred Vapor. I have mixed two flavors from their Select line at a 50/50 ratio. 

The flavors are Blueberry Grapevine and Green Grape Skittles.

Both are 3mg nicotine and 70/30 VG-PG.

 Oooo, I see what you did there.  




 Ok, yes, you are correct. I can feel my heart rate and digestion rate increasing. Both of these are loosely correlated with metabolic rate. So while I guess I cannot directly feel my 'metabolic rate' increasing, I can feel the processes that are positively correlated with said metabolic rate.  









 http://cornerstonecollective.com/better-metabolism-with-cannabis/

Even beyond differences in population, at this point in time, we really dont know why metabolic effects are occurring from cannabis use. Researchers have postulated that the interaction between the endocannabinoid system and the bodys metabolism occurs through partial antagonism of CB1 receptors in the brain. This speculation stems from trials in which Rimonabant and other CB1 receptor antagonists have been shown to reduce body mass.

http://www.foxandnug.com/#!metabolismcannabis/c1x9h

In the study current marijuana use was associated with 16% lower fasting insulin levels. How does this help with metabolism? Too much insulin leads to weight gain by storing fat. So by lowering your insulin levels you minimize the weight gain. Want another reason to justify your marijuana consumption? Chronically elevated insulin levels often lead to insulin resistance, diabetes and heart disease. So get those insulin levels down!! 

The study also notes a significant association with marijuana use and smaller waist circumference. So how is it that marijuana helps your metabolism when marijuana users have higher average caloric intake levels than nonusers. Well the mechanism is not quite understood yet but our guess is that It helps you process sugars in a more efficient way, thus lowering insulin levels, thus minimizing the amount of sugars that are stored and converted to fat in your cells.

Basically, you are mostly correct, the direct effect on metabolism is minimal, however the mechanisms are not currently completely understood. While this is not a scientific source, being a long term smoker, I can actually *feel* my metabolic rate increasing after I smoke. I am willing to bet that once further detailed studies are carried out, a true correlation between marijuana and metabolic rate increase will be discovered/announced.  




 Yea, it fucking blasts the smoke into somebody's lungs if the L is rolled right. Gets you high AF. It's like a grav bong hit without the grav bong.  




 I agree that the first sentence by itself would be considered ambiguous. The remaining sentences however, should provide you with more than enough context.

 I've got Couch Locked in my vape right now. 




 He's not being sensual enough. 




 We call it a shotgun (east coast US). But not the same shotgun as when you flip the blunt around. Both shotguns; two similar but separate meanings. 




 Trickle down smok-o-nomics.

 Dude, this is a Reddit post. You're talking about one of the greatest authors of all time. 




  You know what you call someone with a million dollars in pennies?

Fucked in the head. 




 Works for me, thanks man! 




 Good to know. Haha

"According to some estimates, there are roughly 4,200 religions in the world. The word religion is sometimes used interchangeably with "faith" or "belief system", but religion differs from private belief in that it has a public aspect."

 I hear you. But with 4,000+ different religions, only one can be right. Or none can be right. 

Which seems more likely to you?

Lucifer_Hirsch, you're my hero. 




 Does closure mean buttsex?

 I think the premise is that Hell is soo terrible that even something as insignificant as a spoon will provide at least a menial mental distraction from the torture you are being subjected to.  




 I bet that thing is constantly giving OP splinters.  




 Or they could also be borrowed and revised works of ~~science~~ fiction.  




 You call these bagels? 




 Of course. I was mainly curious as to why he chose "wooden" spoon. It seems to stick out when we're talking about a place that is traditionally hot and fiery. He could have just as easily have said "small metallic spoon" or "small golden spoon" and achieved a similar effect. Just curious as to why the prompt writer himself chose to go with wood.  




  That would only make sense if he didn't use the plural "prompts" in his comment or say "95% of the time", meaning 95/100 prompts. There is no doubt that he's referring to a group of prompts rather than this particular prompt.

You are correct, he is referring to prompt(s) plural. However, by responding to my comment concerning the hate in THIS thread and concerning THIS particular story, it seems as if he is lumping THIS specific post in with the other 95% that are considered leading. 




 Huh? My original comment was speaking on the Writing Prompts hate in this thread, and talks about this specific post in general. His response was "The biggest objection is how leading the prompts are". It is only logical that he is chalking said hate up to this specific prompt being leading.

 Not disagreeing with the efficiency of nuclear energy. I was comparing renewable energy to fossil fuel energy. Just as there is a hard limit on how much power you can generate from a finite area, there is also a hard limit of how much oil you can suck out of a given oil field. 

The fact is that it shouldn't matter how much paper money it costs to make something happen when were talking about ending the irreparable harm we've been causing to the Earth (the one and only planet we live on) by drilling, spilling, and burning these oils and refined fuels.

 1 out of 16, i like those odds. I wonder how many golds he'll get by the time his comment reaches 200! 




 But they could/would if the proper funding was pushed into expanded research and development for those technologies.  




 I mean that's not really the twist, it's a starting scenario. 

After arriving in hell

The writer just chose a direction that used this scenario as the ending to his story. He chose to focus on the build up and the details (and did a great job). 

The prompt writer himself came out and said that this story went in a completely different direction than the 3 ideas he had played out in his head.
