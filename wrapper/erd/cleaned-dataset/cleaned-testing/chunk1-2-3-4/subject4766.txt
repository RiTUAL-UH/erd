 I find this usually happens when your zoomed in too much. zoom out a bit and then it should work cause it works for me.  




 I'm really looking forward to American Sniper are there any movies out right now that are similar to it that I should watch? 




 holy crap do people these days actually know how to spell? "you actually take the works right out of my mouth" do you even english? 









 THE NORTH REMEMBERS!  




 they need to demand that sony sell spiderman back to marvel.  









 Sony should release it claiming they have changed the ending when actual fact they havent. how would north korea know? unless they had a spy actually go watch the released cut.  




 Dont keep trying if it keeps declining it could still be charging you for each time you try. Id wait a bit, most likely the servers are getting borked.  




 Nice set up, like how you have the tv on the wall.  









 If we dont have a hulk movie by phase 4 im gonna be pissed.  














 It will easily play it, dont know about ultra tho. I run it on a gtx 660 with medium to high settings at 1080p.  









 Its one of the best pc ports ever. so yes you should buy it. Plus its not a bad game. even though its like an hour long if your going to play the phantom pain next year youll need to play this.  




 Nope works for me. I have an I7 4790, GTX 660, 8GB ram.  














 I got MGSV: GZ and Flight Simulator X.  









 Bilbo saw a dragon, frodo saw eagles. bilbo wins.  









 yea not funny at all.  









 enjoy your downvotes.  









 i reckon someone already has a copy of it and is sitting on it waiting for the right moment to leak it.  




 Didnt angels and demons cause a bit of controversy?  









 Hopefully someone leaks it.  




 well fuck sony, I hope the hackers screw them up so bad that they have no other choice to sell spiderman back to marvel.  









 its a good work laptop but its no gaming machine.  




 Ive enjoyed every minute of this show but im down to the last 3 episodes of season 2 and i really dont want it to end thats how much ive enjoyed it. Im debating whether or not to finish it now or wait for season 3 so i wont have to wait as long.  




 Nice, This is mine here in New Zealand. Its about 23 outside right now. http://iforce.co.nz/i/yv1r4bep.svc.jpg 




 because there never was a trailer. it was all rumor. it was never actually officially confirmed.  









 why? msi is awesome.  




 I personally will always go with the i7 model as the extra threads for work will come in handy. If you're just playing games then an i5 will be alright but youll find a few years down the line the i5 will begin to bottle neck when compared to the highest i7 at the time because of the extra threads. In some cases there is usually only a $50 difference between an i5 and i7 which is another reason i go for an i7. 
 




 did anyone else read that in the style of the CS voice over lol.  




 most likely testing it.  




 Apparently they are sold out http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/2plz1b/newegg_is_sold_out_of_its_free_3_games_from_the/ 




 usually there is a countdown timer on the steam page of a game thats releasing in a day or so but there is nothing on he ground zeroes page. It just says coming soon. Doesn't that seem a bit strange? or is it just that Konami doesn't know how to use steam? 




 yea? this was announced ages ago.  




 are you overclocking? try resetting to stock clocks and see what happens.  




 haha lol that sure surprised me.  




 its already the 18th here in New Zealand and im wondering why it hasn't started yet :( 




 sell the pc for what ever he can get and save up for new rig? 




 we already have DRM with movies from Itunes you cant play the file outside of Itunes hence its locked to one player. Thats DRM enough imo.  




 yes we have a special coming next year followed by S4 in 2016 but with Cumberbatch now signed on to play Doctor Strange i fear that we are only going to get less and less Sherlock despite Cumerbatch saying he wants to play him to an old man i fear his schedule just wont allow it which begs the question how much longer can the series keep going?  




 I agree and disagree. The way light sabers were used in the prequels was definitely one of the few positives in my books. That final duel between Obiwan and Anakin was incredible, it was just so beautifully choreographed it was like watching a well performed ballet. But i also agree that the duel between vader and luke in empire strikes back was amazing to. It all comes down to whether or not you prefer the prequels or original trilogy and clearly your a fan of the original trilogy and i can respect that. I seem to be one of the few fans who like both trilogies.  




 I'm assuming that's why it says potential. Doesn't necessarily mean it will happen.  









 love the way that 980 lights up. so awesome.  









 Bad AutoModerator!  




 obviously fake since GFWL is no more.  




 yes those specs are real, and yes the ps4 and xbox one are basically low end pcs that use proprietary hardware and cant be upgraded. Basically they are pcs without all the bells and whistles.  




 you ether have a shitty isp or you have some serious line issues ether in your house or between you and the exchange. get that shit sorted bro.  




 man thats to close to the edge.  




 he said $300 lol not $1000.  




 Just show them to this. http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/guide 




 Needs a bit more cable management when you get the time. But other than that looks good.  




 no way your building a pc with that you need at least $450 but even thats pushing it.  




 who has a limit? lol.  









 I find your lack of taste in movies disturbing.  




 its a small game bro, its like 2 and half hours long that sounds about right.  




 1080p easily. 1440p will be pretty decent but you may need to lower some settings. 4k will struggle.  




 you should be able to point steam to the directory of the second hard drive.  




 Because i already have everything i want. who knows this feeling? :( 




 i have $109 to be exact lol  




 na it sucks.  




 i got the images from here http://www.pcgamer.com/windows-10-leaked-build-reveals-new-xbox-app/

what do you guys think of this new xbox app for windows 10? is it a steam like app or just more DRM? i noticed on the bottom left there is a store icon. How cool would it be if we could purchase and play xbox games on pc? it would be a step in the right direction on microsofts part to make a unified experience which is what they hinted at a while ago with that windows 10 announcement that showed a pc, xbox one, tablet etc all lined up against each other. What do you guys think. 




 say you need to test it to make sure its not DOA. 




 Its a good game, dont listen to this review.  




 dude thats not good. Do other temperature reading programs have this issue cause if they do you probably need to reseat your cpu. just sayin.   




 yea that bit was leaked in the emails. its happening in january.  









 At least they're patching it. gotta give some credit. They could of chosen to just leave it the way it was but they did not.  




 The Crew,Fire Works Simulator, Final Fantasy XIII-2. 




 its actually one of the better COD games.  




 clearly a problem with your gpu. The game runs perfectly fine for me.  









 ether the cooler is not mounted properly or you need new thermal paste.  




 BUT 2 GPU  MUST BE BETTER THAN 1 AM I RITE? :( 




 LOL! INB4 CONSPIRACY.  









 What are your thoughts on the pc version so far? i picked it up and im actually enjoying it more than XIII.  




 Looks correct to me? what cpu do you have? nvm I see your flair, it says you have a i5 3570 which is the correct cpu its showing.  




 I would of said Aaron Taylor Johnson but hes already quick silver. Most of the good guys are taken already. they would probably have to cast an unknown but someone who could stand toe to toe on screen with the avengers cast.  
























 his facial expressions tho lol 




 dude nice!  




 And Im actually enjoying this more than FFXIII, makes you realize how badly written the lightning character actually was and the story is just so much better (especially without lightning) in XIII-2 imo.  




 Inb4 Bring Back Brody.  




 Even if its just for a cameo like he bumps into Quinn out on the streets of Pakistan and gives him a piece of advice or something about going rogue. Or he confronts Carrie about a CIA conspiracy or something. But they need to get him involved it would be awesome.  




 what temps are you getting? sounds like it might have gotten a bit dusty or your power supply isn't coping with the stress.  




 January 27th.  




 there was? got a link.  




 What movies do you consider to be a hidden gem? 









 haha this is awesome.  




 basically what the title says. do you think well see more high frame rate movies after the hobbit or does the format die with the release of the last hobbit movie? 




 Yea I skimmed through it and stopped when i saw pics of the actual script.  




 Ouch. Hope it turns out as good as Skyfall or at least Casino Royale.  




 Just scan your computer, thats all you can really do atm. Perhaps change your passwords to all your important accounts just in case.  




 Correct. ALI213 is the default name a particular pirated version of the game uses.  




 I almost choked on my own saliva reading this haha.  




 where have you been? hes talking about all the leaked emails from sony.  




 Im enjoying it. Havent really had an issue with the micro transactions since i dont use them.  




 Dude he's been awesome as spidey and it will kill him if this happens. Hes a true fan. They have to keep him.  









 thats a good thing! people need to realize that adaptations that steer away from their source material is a good thing since not everything translates well into film.  




 Box and Hardware Pr0n. Nice!  




 lol dat pirated copy of AC:Unity.  




 This has never happened to me! off all things that have happened to me no one has ever tried  to scam me on steam. where are these so called scammers? never encountered one at all.  




 I dont even want to watch it because i know it will just piss me off.  









 Whats the best flight simulator out right now? 




 uncharted games usually do end up looking just like the footage in the trailers.  









 And Oliver stayed dead. Would you guys still watch if Roy took over team arrow? 




 I just bought the crew and i cant even activate my key cause apparently the servers are down or their are connection issues. Is this happening for anyone else? 









 Seems to be a common trend these days. the first couple of months of the new year are usually the dumping ground for movies you would think would be better suited for directed to dvd releases. March has gotten better over the last couple of years with movies like the hunger games taking advantage of the less competition during that time but Jan-Feb continue to deliver nothing but crap. Any particular reason for this? 














 Just got back from seeing the battle of five armies. I need some time to digest what i saw but over all it was really good imo a fitting conclusion to the middle earth saga. 




 After what happened on yesterdays episode. This now opens the door to a civil war in the MCU with the rise of more Inhumans it gives a reason for stark to get nervous about people with special abilities and to start talking to the government about how to deal with these people. 









 Can anyone tell me what movies are still canon in the x-men timeline? 




 For instance mine are the james bond films i always tell my self ill re watch skyfall or quantum of solace this weekend but nope it never happens. Anyone else got a movie their like that with.  




 I feel like it doesnt really represent the tone of the film all to well i think they should of just cut it and started straight at the marvel logo followed by quills dancing scene as usual. would of been much better imo  



















 But this time have him direct it instead of Blomkamp. Surely Microsoft knows they have a good thing going here with Halo and that people actually want to see this made! the short films Blomkamp did for the halo 3 advertising campaign were amazing so if they could still get Blomkamp involved as producer along side Jackson it would be perfect. If you dont know what im talking about check this out. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejw3xpPIVbQ 




 I quite often see people complaining about this one. Anyone care to explain? 














 Cause they are too serious for Collin Firth's taste hehe.  




 So in just a few days the last hobbit movie finally releases which means Peter Jackson's middle Earth saga will be complete. The hobbit trilogy has had mixed reception compared to LOTR but thinking a head how will the trilogy go down in history? do you think more people might start to appreciate over time? or will people continue despise it? 




 Gonna buy the game tonight. Any one know where the cheapest place is to buy it? 









 Cause your cpu and gpu are running hotter than normal. God damn it. Time to invest in better cooling.  









 Havent played the game since release on pc so decided to try patch 1.3 and I must say even though there are still some bugs that need to be worked out like still being able to glitch in walls and swimming in mid air lol in terms of frame rate and just in general the ability to just play the game without stuttering its a huge improvement. Just thought id add my two cents. 

Specs of my rig. 

I7 4790
8GB RAM
GTX 660 2gb  




  i mean i thought this would be something that doesnt happen until further down the line like im talking the last season of the show or something, but it looks like they want to get it out of the way. Anyone else think its too soon? 














 I dont understand why so many people seem to struggle playing him. Just spam q, whats so difficult about that? 




 So It looks they are going the DOFP route and are going to reset everything in the terminator universe or at least some major events in the universe and then start fresh from when ever the franchise is reset to. Are we ok with this? what if they erase the first 2 movies and essentially make them pointless cause of the reset? 









 3DM said by the end of this week? any news? 














 Lets take the hobbit for example, i see nothing wrong with it. ive enjoyed it right from the start and i love what peter jackson has done with middle earth and yet people still complain about silly arguments like too much CGI or he ruined the movie by adding stuff that wasn't in the book. but its not just the hobbit where im seeing this. 

The new star wars trailer for instance everyone is complaining about something whether it be the damn light saber or the lense flare near the millennium falcon or the CG in the teaser, yes ive seen people complain about that to. UGH. what is it with people and why cant we just enjoy what we have been given am I missing something here? 




 it could be a lot worse even if its only from people who have been to press screening reviews. 

http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_hobbit_the_battle_of_the_five_armies/

 




 You know its going to piss of the batman fans.  














 I thought it was really good even though the premise is kind of stupid i enjoyed it for what it was and it actually kind of worked for me despite it being a silly diluted plot it was still an enjoyable flick imo.  









 What type of stories would you like to see made in to movies? The obvious one would be an origin of gollum movie since we only catch a glimpse of it in return of the king and hear little tid bits of it through dialog, i think gollum is interesting enough to carry his own movie. Also one issue i can see being a problem is what would be the end game for a MECU? since LOTR is essentially the end any movies would have to take place prior to LOTR. Unless they came up with their own stories on what happens after LOTR but I cant really see what working well. Any ideas? 





























 Made a poll since im curious to see which version is more popular. Also perhaps explain in the comments what made you swing towards that paticular version. For me it was alpha sapphire because it has lugia and i like lugia more than Ho-Oh :)

http://strawpoll.me/3101987 




 I just bought alpha sapphire of the eshop. How long should the download take? 




 If your a gamer then youll know 2014 has been kind of shit for gaming at least imo. So many big titles have been delayed till next year which got me wondering. Why dont we hear about movies getting delayed as much as games? I mean sure we had the amazing spiderman 3 delayed this year to 2018 and as far as i know thats the only one this year. Though to be fair i dont keep up with movie news as much as i do video game news so I may be wrong on that part but if someone could enlighten me as to why movie delays dont seem to be as common id be interested to hear the reason behind it.  




 Who else agrees? 

In case you need your memory refreshed. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqO5wlwQcRI 




 im interested in movies like The Prestige and Now you see me.  




 In todays day in age with the likes of itunes and netflix. I feel like we should be at a point now where if we wanted to we could pay the price of a movie ticket and get to watch the movie at home in private the same day its released at the movies but it hasnt happened yet. Im just curious why?  




 I think my game might have glitched because im pretty sure ive done everything right up until this point. At 5:18 in this walkthrough there is a door that opens so you can get to the second pulse generator https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ekz6R_m-SE but the thing is in my game the door is red and refuses to open. ive killed all the flood and covenant but it its not opening. Any ideas.  









 Id be willing to pay something ridiculous for an epic game like that. 




 There were rumors about him being involved in the film. Was that his voice? doing the whole "there has been an awakening" dialog? it sounds a hell of a lot like his smaug voice but slightly altered.  









 I feel like its an appropriate thing to do.  




 I sated in the other thread that I thought the dark knight was the boring one of the trilogy mostly because of the dry Harvey Dent plot with all the politics while begins and rises are great action films the dark knight seemed more like a political spy thriller rather than a straight up action movie like the other 2 and may have been why i found it boring. Anyone else agree? 




 That bit of marketing always confuses me and it makes no sense. I mean if they mean that it will be in cinemas exclusively for a while then sure but other wise to me it makes no sense when we know it will be on dvd and bluray and itunes and all that later on so whats the point? 




 Got my xbox one yesterday and ive got a few downloadable games that im currently downloading would like to check on their status when im out. Is there a way i can check on them when im not home? 




 Anyone know if this weeks ep will be the last for the year? most of the shows I watch have ended for their fall finale.  









 Im expecting a bunch of emotional character close ups, maybe one VFX shot and one last shot of something that will make the fans have a WTF moment to build hype for the next year. I heard the last shot of the trailer is meant to be the villain holding vaders helmet or something? 




 cant afford to go the movies tonight so ill be watching something at home on the internet. Ill watch pretty much watch anything except for horrors and romantic comedies. so fire away.  




 Why hasnt it been posted yet? 




 It sucks use Imgur instead.  


































 Sherlock, Smaug and soon Doctor Strange. All tho I still need to see the Imitation game.  




 you realize its not coming out till march 2016 right? 









 Gone girl is good but not nightcrawler or whiplash good.  




 I know Im late to the party but my god that was amazing. It's easily tied for best picture along side Nightcrawler. Tho I still need to see other films like boyhood, raid 2 and imitation game but damn whiplash was incredible. That drum solo at the end. wow was that intense and every time J.K. Simmons came on screen my eyes were just immediately drawn to him, he has such an incredible presence its kinda scary and he just elevates everyone around him I mean Miles Teller as well that dude can act. Whiplash is easily in the top 5 movies of 2014.  




 I think sinister six will merge with amazing spider-man 3, that means sony can get one more movie out of Andrew Garfield and wrap up the trilogy properly. Then sell the rights back to marvel.  




 Awesome. i was looking forward to seeing this on the big screen again back when its original re release was cancelled. so Im looking forward to this. I saw ROTS 5 times when came out. Thought it was amazing then and I still do now. 









 The current generation haswell will be enough for a few more years at least even when the broadwell desktop parts come the performance increase wont be enough to warrant an upgrade it will be something silly like 5% IPC or some BS 




 I cant seem to find any games this morning and it says it cant retrieve my items from the inventory. Anyone else got this problem? 




 read his comment again, SLI doesn't always improve performance infact sometimes it can get worse because of how poorly optimized the SLI profile is for the particular game.  




 that's what im saying avoid $20 power supplies. they're cheap and are usually built with poor components. Thats what I meant by dont cheap out on the power supply.  




 you never want to cheap out on the power supply no matter how cheap your over all build is, one bad power supply and your pc could get fried.  




 Glorious set up brother! you should check ebay when you get more funds to get a nice cheap decent gpu.  









 From the announcement it doesnt sound like it.  




 have you tried playing the new game from telltale? its pretty damn good even if its just filler stuff.  









 wow, looking forward to playing the new pokemon on this.  




 I figured that since DA:I finally got cracked lords of the fallen would follow, but that doesnt seem to be the case. Anyone know if it will be cracked at all? 














 Got some left over christmas money to spend, wondering if I should pick this up. Is it good? 




 you might need a bios update. if I remember some amd bios were incompatible with some newer games.  




 So did The Dark Knight Rises, The way that whole plane sequence was shot was pretty incredible.  




 The Avengers. The way Loki makes his entrance is awesome.  














 Boyhood is also out in 720p 




 the year just started, have a little patience. Id be willing to wager that most of these if not all will be online by the end of the month.  









 we know it's sometime this month but do we have an actual date? 




 when did this trend start? was it for prometheus or before that? 




 They're filming this year however its not coming out till 2017. Why do they need an extra year and whats stopping it from making a 2016 release? seems a bit strange.  




 between now and the end of january is usually when it happens so fingers crossed.  




 it comes out in August thats more than a few months away but you are right. we should of had a teaser by now.  




 well at least I know a dvd screener is out their and hopefully it might leak! :D 




 Thing I hate the most is the awkward silence right after the trailers end and right before the movie starts everyone starts opening up their lollies and packets of chips and its like jeez. lol.  




 No. I hate eating during movies. I find it too distracting.  




 But what if the host doesnt want the baby from the start? why should she be forced to have it? its not fair on the child to be brought into a world where its not even wanted.  




 Completely agree with this.  




 this. plus No woman should be made to look after a child if she didnt want it from the start. I hate people that get all up tight about this subject about how if she didnt use protection then its her fault and she should keep the child but why should she if she never wanted it in the first place and it was a damn mistake?  




 I reckon seeing a live mammoth would of been pretty bad ass.
 




 Spiders,Snakes,Cockroaches. Seeing life sized versions of those would probably kill me lol.  




 When ever I tell someone online that I'm from New Zealand they go oh that's next to Australia right? Or Hey that's where Lord of the Rings was made. Usually its something along those lines. Why is this? Why do people seem to know nothing about my country?  









 I watched guardians of the galaxy for like the 10th time yesterday. 




 Im super pumped for it. Im all for anything to help fill the void while we wait for age of ultron and agents of shield to return.  




 Linux sux use a real OS like windows.  




 works for me so dont know about u guys.  




 I wont be getting my 970 till at least the end of February :( 




 They love teasing us :( 




 just buy a physical copy then? 









 Rockstar said they would be released in a couple of a weeks back in late December. So where are the system requirements? 




 did you even read the article? its for the half life 1 remake black mesa announcing its full release.  




 I totally forgot this game even existed.  




 just go to any pc vs console video and be amazed.  









 Thats never been confirmed outside of the leaked emails from November. Things could of changed since then.  









 Off the top of my head, this one from Iron Man 3 comes to mind https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv2bGsdizhM so bad lol. 




 Time Gem in Ant-Man and Soul Gem in Doctor Strange.  




 I pray to the marvel gods that they get spiderman back! pls sony just give up, make some sort of statement to the fans about wanting spiderman to have a better future, admit you made mistakes and move on.  




 Yus!!! hopefully this trailer is more story focused than the last couple.  




 Never seen the original Mad Max before and with the sequel coming out I was thinking I should watch it. Just wondering how does it hold it up today? Do I need to watch it or can I go into fury road blind with no knowledge of the original? 




 yea i was gonna say wtf man, taking your computer and tv sure thats what burglars do but to steal a mans bed? fuck your asking for trouble now son. A man needs his beauty sleep. 




 they never said it was half done filming. it never even made it to principal photography. But it was well into development. They were probably a couple of months away from filming when it was cancelled.  














 Draco Malfoy from the HP series.  




 i gave u an up vote because you were unfairly down voted. I want winter soldier or DOFP to be nominated for best picture so then the Comic book movie genre will be taken more seriously. I dont think a comic book movie has been nominated since the dark knight. the winter soldier and DOFP both deserve recognition for best picture. Ill probably get down voted for saying this but its true.  




 'All this hype. WHat if it turns out it was cut for a reason' You have to wonder how much rogue they actually filmed and decided to cut if their able to release another version based on Rogue. Im really curious to see it.  




 I watched this again for the first time in like 5 years, still cracks me up every time. Its one of the few comedies that legitimately get me laughing. what did you guys think of the movie? 









 65c isnt bad. That should not be causing a shutdown. whats the max temp for the 8320? i thought it would be like 90c max or something? 




 Im really interested to see how he pulled off the awesome Joker voice. Are there any documentaries or behind the scenes stuff that show how he did it?  









 Yup, no idea what the specs are tho its from 2005.  




 yea thought it might of been ebay. bad luck bro. always go to a decent company like Ibuypower or cyberpowerpc for prebuilts.  









 thats why i always check the channel directly. youtubes feed is shit period. it never seems to work for me.  




 just because someone has an AMD cpu or graphics card doesnt make them any less a part of the master race than you me or anyone else and I think a lot of you seem to forget that. Quite often ill see someone get down voted because they have an AMD rig. I want to know why is AMD thought off so negatively here on this subreddit?  




 This one? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRd-CeWzZrs 




 i hope your right bro, id love it if we got the master chief collection and the gears of war games. Hell id be happy with those. but any future titles we get id consider a bonus. ms please all i want at least is halo and gears! 




 yea they do. Some of us actually liked titan fall and despite already owning destiny on ps4 I want it on PC for the superior visuals and just over all better experience.  




 id say its pretty much confirmed now. There were rumors like this with GTA V on pc right up until it was confirmed. All we need to do is a wait for bungie to confirm it, probably early next year. I have yet to finish destiny on ps4 so I may actually wait and play it on pc with a controller.  









 Snape in Harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2. 




 With only a few days left of the sale its currently at $13.74. Should I buy it now or wait till the last day just to make sure it doesnt get cheaper? 




 summer 2015 maybe? im just guessing.  




 probably less than 500w. A long the lines of the 970/980.  




 'The game I turned my consoles on for the most this year' hahaha well played totalbiscuit.  




 seriously? IMDB is trash. At least the forums are. I never found IMDB reliable at all.  




 And Andrew Bond? Can anyone explain? was Bonds father named Andrew? 




 A lot of people seem rather one sided about this, some think its cap others think its stark. I think its captain america. A large portion of the movie focuses on him and his back story. Though I can see why others would say its Stark.  




 Peter Jackson's King Kong? 




 I know what you mean OP! Im having trouble keeping my ambient room temperature down because of how tiny my room is. As soon as I shut my bedroom door my cpu temp rises because my ambient temp rises which pisses me off. So I have to keep my door open until I can afford a fan off sorts. 




 I5. better performance and a better upgrade path. 









 imagine if the harry potter movies were made now,Benedict Cumberbatch would of played voldemort.  









 I was just wondering about this because I remember before it was announced that Norton wasn't returning I remember reading heaps of rumors how the hulk was going to be tbe villain in the avengers and team was going to have to hunt him down because of how out of control he was getting, this was of course before Norton left the role. Did anyone else hear any similar rumors regarding the hulk in the avengers before Norton left? 




 Did someone order a pizz...I mean monitor xD 




 nice build. eventually you can upgrade to an i3 or i5.  




 I gagged while looking at this.  




 because the characters surrounding her a more interesting. you know your show is bad when your main character is less interesting than your supporting characters.  




 we are getting phantom pain next year so dont worry :) 




 you aint getting any karma from me son. Controllers are perfectly fine for FPS. 




 Because this game looks awesome. I'm sure a lot of people outside of korea want to play it. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/2m66gt/lost_ark_the_new_korean_hack_and_slash/ 




 did you flick the switch on at the back? 




 Intel. I used to be all pro amd but once you go Intel you can never go back.  




 lol i bet if you showed him the controllers working on your pc he would of said its fake even if you were playing a game right in front of him. sounds like hes one of those guys who searches for a movie trailer and calls it fake when its not lol.  




 I dont see anything wrong with it? don't act ungrateful.  




 TAG THIS MOFO! NSFMR!!! 




 This the exact upgrade I hope to make next year. I'm running a 660 myself. its a great card.  




 so does it still work? 




 thats kind of creepy.  




 Has anyone actually been able to see this yet? I heard finding a screening is like finding a needle in a haystack?  




 Thats fuckin amazing! its like an Frankenstein pc lol 




 yep your all good :) 




 you can play it just fine. those sites are highly inaccurate.  




 Thats not a bad rig, honestly you could just upgrade to a gtx 970 and you would be sweet. you might get a tiny bit of a bottle neck with that cpu but it would barely be noticeable.  




 I think this has to stop guys I mean look at this post http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/2qei24/my_brother_has_become_a_peasant_today/

The guy makes fun of his brother because he got an xbox one for Christmas I mean isnt that taking it a bit too far? using it to insult someone? Its not a joke any more and especially during christmas calling someone a console peasant out side of this sub who has no idea what it means is rather insulting and vulgar. Anyone else agree? I hope the mods will at least consider it because Im sick and tired of seeing thie term used now and quite frankly its embarrassing.  




 Nice! Hope the build goes well :) 




 So I just noticed this just now, as soon as I open /r/pcmasterrace my temps spike from around 35-36C to about 45C and go back to 35-36C as soon as I close it. Is it because of the snow animation at the top thats causing the High cpu usage? anyone else getting this? this happens in both chrome and firefox. any other web page is fine.  




 I have a debit card so i'm just gonna deposit it straight in to my bank account. :) 









 just wondering, how do you know it was stolen? i know you said you saw the delivery guys coming down the street but how do you know it wast stolen did a neighbor or friend notify you? 














 correct. Broadwell will use LGA1150 the same socket as the current Haswell but Skylake which was mentioned above will use a new socket.  




 aye? i thought it was broadwell? only the mobile parts of broadwell are out we are still waiting for the desktop parts.  




 The next wave of Intel cpus is Broadwell which still uses LGA1150. however they are not due out till sometime next year. As far as im aware it wont be much of an upgrade over haswell unless someone can correct me? id stick with Haswell in a new build.  




 aye, its not free.  




 even worse now that rocket has basically left development to open up a new studio and start working on another game. you know its bad when the creator leaves and doesn't even want to finish his product.  




 and yet that guy spent over 200 hours playing it. obvious troll is obvious.  




 wot? 




 I'm among the few who enjoyed the first amazing spiderman but I havent even been able to get through the 2nd one yet. Its that bad. And I dont think its all of reddit, it just seems like that cause of how often its posted.  




 it says that all 10 of DCs upcoming movies are part of the same universe meaning that includes Shazam. This is coming directly from an official source now so there is no doubt this time.  




 the lord of the rings references lmao.  




 its possible the gameplay despite being from the pc version is that its running on a ps4 devkit which is essentially a pc with the same specs as a retail console.  




 aye inquisition is awesome. 




 I cant read any of what your friend added. 









 the New 3DS clearly states it doesnt come with a charger .its stupid I know. But this info has been known for a while now.  




 its ether FC4 or The Crew. Dont even bother with unity.  









 Even with that clarification he still doesnt sound too keen on the crossover happening.  




 Now that hes free from Ant-Man do we know if he has anything in the pipeline?  




 if it was a publicity stunt then why only give the movie in a limited release? seems like they are still taking the terrorist threats somewhat serious.  




 Nothing is gonna happen. its a bunch of fake wannabe terrorists trying to act tough behind a keyboard.  




 the 270x requires a 500w power supply so yours is more than enough. Its possible the power supply is on its way out and the timing is a just coincidence that it started happening when you put in your new 270x. perhaps put in your old 7850 and see if it still happens. if it doesnt happen then maybe its an issue with your 270x. what make and model is your power supply ?  




 This one?

 so no 950ti? seems like the 950ti would work really well on the new architecture.  




 how is he biased? he still uses intel in most of his rigs.  




 i have the entire collection on origin. its glorious.  




 already been posted.  









 Navy seals? aye more like ninjas lol.  




 thats a 970? huh it looked so small i thought it was a 750ti.  




 some people dont have time or just cant be bothered.  




 its back man.  




 its back! 




 the end of the world? 




 Your worrying too much, it will be fine. Some sites take a bit longer to update their shipping status.  




 Dam it! 









 wtf, i seriously hope your joking. your in some serious shit other wise.  




 you've probably bumped a cable loose some where, check they're all properly connected to the motherboard.  




 no begging.  




 we have them in EB games in Auckland.  




 Ive got a spare copy of half life 2 in my inventory and have been wanting to get cod 4 for a while now. Anyone want to trade? ill gift it to the person and then they can gift me?

 Just play games bro, i dont upgrade until i find a game i cant play.  




 So im trying to mod skyrim, But for some reason none of them are working and i have a feeling its because they're not in the right order. I heard some mods have to be specifically placed before or after other mods but i have no idea what i should be doing here. Any idea what order these should be in?

 Cry moar bitch.  




 For those wondering what im talking about, its when Linus pulls on the heat sink and its just dangling in the air.  









 im down for that! 




 This could actually be awesome. Imagine the crew of the enterprise pulling off an awesome space heist!  




 i think its creepy how much she looks like Brody.  




 because its so damn creepy how much she looks like Brody! 




 yea thats what i thought, I thought they might of aired the wrong episode because when Carrie and Dar are talking at the start i was like aye, did I miss something? this episode felt so out of place.  




 those episodes were golden compared to this crap we got.  




 got a source for this? 




 strange, i played this game for over 20 hours and never had an issue.  









 same, wish they would put Quinn and Saul in charge. would be so much better.  




 Anyone else get the feeing that there will be less Carrie and more Quinn and Saul next season?  Carrie basically doesnt have any reason to be on the show any more. Quinn is off doing his own missions and Saul looks like hes back at the CIA. Id love it if season 5 was Quinn and Saul doing mission together. Quite frankly I think Carrie's story has run its course, she said good bye to Quinn they no their relationship will never work. Quinn made that obviously clear when he left. I'm sure Carrie will still feature next season but hopefully as more of a supporting character, I really think she needs to take the backseat for a while and let the others shine. just my 2 cents.  




 Its fake. There are no legit torrents for the movie yet.  









 Here's a small recap trailer I found, it still missed out heaps of stuff but it covers the basic plot. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6V__oXbHeg 









 So in all his interviews recently, I don't know who keeps bringing it up whether its him or his interviewers but he keeps mentioning how he doesn't want people to think of guardians of the galaxy as an infinity war prequel and how he doesn't seem to fond of the guardians crossing over with the avengers and it all makes him sound rather arrogant imo because its not his decision to make where the guardians are placed in the MCU.

Now in all fairness I can understand that he wants guardians to stand on its own but guardians is part of the MCU that's never going to happen and its inevitable they will meet the avengers one way or another with or without Gunn. 

It seems to me that perhaps Gunn doesn't like where the MCU is going and Feige's vision as a whole since he even complained recently about writing Thanos in to guardians and how much trouble it was and how it was a plot that was just serving the avengers and didnt really add anything for the guardians and he doesnt want guardians to serve the avengers which again I can understand but its not his decision to make.  

Kevin Feige has a master plan hes the quiet puppet master who is pulling the strings behind the scenes and it seems like Gunn isn't too keen on following his vision. Not sure if its just me but that's the vibe im getting he wants guardians to stand on their own just how Edgar Wright wanted Antman to be standalone but that obviously wasn't going to happen and he had to be let go. 

It looks like Gunn might be in a similar position and hes starting to get rather vocal about his opinions (Which I think is good) but I hope he sits down and seriously thinks about what hes been saying before he gets in trouble with the higher ups at Marvel and Disney. 

We all know Marvel isn't afraid to change directors. I think what it comes down to is can Gunn and Feige come to a neutral agreement on who has the most control because it sounds like Gunn wants more control than he actually has. I'm only speculating here and more than likely Gunn is just messing with us and behind the scenes hes completely on board with the avengers and guardians crossing over (I hope anyway) however If worst comes to worst they may change director again and thats the last thing I want. Thats just my opinion though.   




 The PC isnt part of any generation. Its one constant platform. Its always changing.  You cant define it by a generation.  









 That's pretty cool. People hate on Microsoft for their lack of pc gaming support but this proves that at least someone at microsoft does care . 




 the best deals are usually on the last day. 




 This is an old article sony have said they are looking at different ways to release the movie sometime in the future. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-30559169 
























 Anyone want to guess where Thor and Hulk will be during this? I'm guessing Thor will be in Asgard dealing with Loki and trying to find out what happened to Odin and Hulk will possibly be off world? on his own intergalactic adventure if the rumors are to be believed. 
 














 The original release of GTA 5. I think the game was impossible to get on ether the 360 or ps3 for at least a week. At least in my area.  



















 Its still spider-man though. They don't have to market Miles Morales they just have to market spider-man.  




 If marvel and sony struck a deal to have Spider-Man in civil war but it was Miles Morales and not Peter Parker. How do you think people would react? would people care? I mean its still spider-man just not Peter Parker 




 I think a really cool franchise could be made out of Inception. It could be like the matrix mixed with a bit of bond/mission impossible action along with some spy thriller elements.And if they couldn't get DiCaprio to return then it could focus on the other members of the team and have the second and third film follow them around on other extraction jobs with an over arcing plot involving some sort of government conspiracy and cyber criminals and terrorists where they extract or plant ideas to prevent attacks and catch criminals etc. Any other ideas? 




 What on earth did I just watch? is this a porno? 




 it's gonna get a bit bumpy. 




 can we stop with the whole no pre order thing. this forum is about 5% of the total pc community. So its pointless telling people not to pre order it wont make a difference.  




 Interstellar would make a pretty sweet game.  














 This seems to be the "cool" answer to any half life 3 related post these days. But we all know you will still buy it day 1.  




 Halo and the possibility of a new Gears of war game in the future was my reason. I'm hoping microsoft will announce something awesome at this years E3 to make the purchase worth while other wise its just gathering dust.  









 they love it because it makes them feel special when they can say "my platform has this game so it must be better than your platform" and it also helps them justify their purchase even when they wont admit how crappy the console actually is.  









 Does anyone have any idea why marvel seem to have put it on the back burner for now? Everyone seemed damn sure we would get one in phase 3 but we didn't and now it looks like we might not even get one in phase 4. It looks like the Hulk will continue to be a supporting character in the avengers films which is kind of sad that marvel seem to be wasting Marks talent by using him once every 2-3 years for avengers films. Look I get that the Hulk isn't exactly an easy character to make a movie about due to him being a sort of anti hero if you will and it can be difficult to balance between Banner and Hulk but come on marvel give Hulk some love in phase 4 please! 




 Plus he lost to star lord in a humiliating dance off so who would want to return after that? 




 Your not gonna get that performance at $100. if you can add $40 you can get a 750ti.

 I read the 960 uses 120w max at laod. So would a 500w psu be enough for SLI? 




 he said buses haha.  




 370x is probably gonna be a beast.  









 OP has bad taste. 




 are you sure you saw John Wick? because the John Wick I saw was bloody awesome. Beautifully shot and had one of Keanu Reeve's best performances.  




 I finally got to see it yesterday and I think it may be Michael Caine's best performance yet. That scene where Murph visits Professor Brand in hospital just before he dies, I was holding back man tears. Time and time again Caine continues to impress and Nolan keeps bringing out the best in Caine. Looking forward to what he does next.  




 lame spot. its all seen it , been there.  




 Can someone explain the ending as simple as possible because I got a bit confused when we get the bit where cooper appears to fall in to the black hole and time itself and how he communicates with his daughter through the watch. just want some clarification on it.  




 bullshit. no way it will make it close to mockingjay or guardians.  




 Noooo!  




 Do we know for sure that this is going to be about the bounty hunters stealing the death star plans? I heard a few other sites saying that its going to be the Han Solo film? 




 I think the court room drama has actually been the most entertaining stuff so far.  




 Totally agree. I hope they do a sequel.  




 Fool of a took!  




 old post is old.  









 I might. I'm not a HUGE fan of the RE games but I enjoyed them for what they are.  




 i say its Merlin cause in the promo you see him talking to team arrow and he presents the weapon Raz used to kill oliver. So how could of he gotten it if he wasn't there? 




 My planet just got Annihilated 




 You have to say it in the awesome Korean accent!  




 I'm guessing its Merlin.  




 aw 




 With Oliver potentially out of the picture for a while will Felicity give Barry a heads up on what happened?  




 Oliver will be dead the rest of the season until next season when Barry goes back in time and saves him.  




 Plot twist. They do another arrow vs flash crossover where barry goes back in time and saves him.  




 To be fair I didnt even notice till I saw this. So they must of done something right.  









 run some benchmarks for a an hour or so and check the temps.  




 yea this is a really interesting site. You can find other game companies on it to even VALVE.  




 sure you were drunk...  




 aye, its $109 on psn and xbox live.  




 wont work. they will deny your credit/debit card.  




 I enjoyed it. A lot of people are saying its average and doesn't deserve all the Oscar nominations it got but I disagree I think it does. Its a great film and its one of Bradley Coopers best performances. I hope ether American Sniper or Whiplash win Best picture.  









 its like the matrix meets superman.  









 The only reason Boyhood might win imo is because of the whole 12 year process behind it and Birdman wont win because its such a mixed bag. You ether like it or dislike it. Mean while Whiplash is more grounded and has great performances all round and its got the technical awards behind it to for best editing and sound which past best picture winners usually have as well.  




 Everyone seems to think whiplash is the under dog this year. Saying their happy its been nominated but no way it will win. I actually think it might. Anyone else?  




 even if thats the case it will pop up some where else quick enough.  




 cant tell if sarcasm or serious....  




 and me  




 unless you know someone in china who could buy it for you and  then gift it to you then yea your probably out of luck.  




 Under the mountain. I know Sam Neil did that real budget looking film but it was kinda crap. Would like to see a proper franchise made out of it.  




 Just buy the pc bro. your only going to more douche bags here trying to force you to build one.  




 If you dont want to build one dont. Ill get down voted for saying that but its your money and if your more comfortable getting a pre built then get it. Cyber pc are great. Highly Recommend.  














 yea the unfortunate side effects of ageing. I think DOFP was probably the last time well see these two together on screen as X-Men.  




 how long did you test it for? you can test for over 10 hours and still have an unstable overclock. These sound like symptoms of a bad oc.  




 It obviously means your oc is not stable.  









 anyone else think they should of attached it to ant-man instead? that movie could of done with the boost of ticket sales. Avengers 2 doesnt need the extra box office its already going to be a hit.  




 There has been an awakening, have you felt it? 









 So Im a bit confused about the time line in the upcoming x-men apocalypse film. Since everything has been reset in DOFP. Does apocalypse take place in a new universe post time line reset or is it before the reset? Im guessing its before since the original cast wont be returning because all of the x-men will be too young for the original actors . But its been confirmed for a while now that Hugh Jackman will return as Wolverine. So how does that work ? or will it be like DOFP and some of it will be in the past and future at the same time? 




 its their money they can spend it how they wish.  



















 I think they sometimes do an easter sale cant verify that tho.  




 he could saved up for a couple months on a really tight budget? you dont know his current circumstances.  




 Matthew Vaughn Approves this shit! 




 Welp I could log in and get to the server list now its back to the way it was before, I cant even log in.  




 But the wait time is over an hour and half. WTF.  




 So I bought the game on steam and now im having trouble making an account. Do I have to use the same email as my steam account and do I have to use the same username as my steam account or not? im kinda confused. Because its saying my account doesnt have access.  




 Sony Offline Entertainment 




 I think it might of been too "out there" for the academy if that makes sense and it doesn't help that it wasnt released during oscar season.  









 Been trying for the last hour, no luck. Is anyone besides a couple of twitch streamers actually playing? 




 the entire franchise hinges on her being in the movie! 




 Just watched the film and im just wondering about the end. Did the investigation ever find out why the veteran Chris was helping killed him? I want to avoid going into conspiracy theories if possible but Im just curious about what happened.  









 what a weird month to push it back to. Like I can understand wanting to be on oscar season but why not November? Their brave releasing it so close to star wars. 




 http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/sherlock-season-4-2015-special-4-episode-1201256929/

The new season will consist of a special episode, which will begin filming in January 2015, and three episodes, which will commence production later in the year and will likely appear in early 2016. 




 season 4 will film later this year. when it airs idk. Right now their just filming the special.  




 i liked the amazing spiderman 2 so i actually want a third film.  




 inb4 left 4 dead is actually the superior game lmao.  














 Avatar

This trailer was beautifully put together, its a shame the movie didn't quite live up to the hype that came from it. Still enjoyed the final product tho. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PSNL1qE6VY

Spiderman 3

This trailer got me so damn excited for venom and it still does. Just wish they could of done better by the character. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bzqHbTD64w

Inception

As great as inception was I still think its trailers were better than the movie itself especially this one the action, music and sound design in the trailer was miles above anything that was actually featured in the movie itself.  Still a great film tho again another one that was way over hyped thanks to a great trailer. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66TuSJo4dZM
 




 I hope whiplash gets nominated for best picture.  









 I wont believe it till we get an official announcement. Ive been burned too many times by latino review. Id say there's a 50% chance is this is legit but wait till something official.  









 http://www.nintendo.com/nintendo-direct/01-14-2015/

Do you think well get any information regarding the 2015 pokemon game? or is it too soon? 




 I kinda wish Brandon Routh wasnt cast as the atom now that way he could of been superman in supergirl.  




 noo! are you crazy? the ending was phenomenal the way it is!  




 fuck, for some reason I first read this as avengers 2. Almost gave me a heart attack.  




 Would you ever consider directing a super hero movie for ether marvel or DC?  









 He was obviously joking you people need to learn how to detect sarcasm.  














 that's probably the truth of it to be honest It doesn't make financial sense for rockstar to have a team as large as the console development team working on a pc version they probably have like 5-10 guys working on the pc port who have no knowledge of how the pc architecture actually works they just assume that everything will translate smoothly because of the x86 architecture used on the new consoles but now their finding out that its actually not that easy.  




 you cant be stupid enough to think he was being serious? 




 it kind of is. I mean if you look back at something like the watchdogs delay that was like what a whole 6 months? to compare to something like that 2 months is a slight shift i guess its just how one interprets it.  




 I cant believe you people thought he was actually serious. He was obviously joking.  




 If I had to pick one Id say its because March is the end of their fiscal year so its just all 'money money money. 
 




 he was obviously joking , did you actually think he was serious? no one would ever do that.  




 I already have a ps4 and xbox one along with my pc. So it doesnt really matter.  




 Heck no. If your getting fps issues the problem lies else where.  




 the people having performance issues are the ones who have bottle necking issues. Their cpu is probably not up to the task. Like dont do something stupid and pair a 970 with a pentium cpu. ofc you will get bottle neck.  









 I will still buy it on PC when it comes out dont worry about that I just really want to play it right now. ive been waiting since last year when it came out on ps4/xb1.  









 I said to myself if it was delayed again Im gonna give on the pc version and just get it on console and that's exactly what Im doing. sorry guys but **** this. Im getting it on ps4 next week. Ive waited long enough to play this.  




 their talking about cpu cores.  




 I said to myself that if it was delayed again im gonna  give up on the pc version and get it on console and that's exactly what Im doing. sorry guys but **** this. Im getting it on ps4 next week. that's just how it is. I still have my pc but its time like these where my faith in Gaben tested. 




 Well I said to myself if it was delayed again ill give up get it on console and that's exactly what Im doing. sorry guys but **** this. Im getting it on ps4 next week.  




 Yes it does! the ending was too open ended, I want to see Christopher return with a huge as army of prawns and **** shit up.  




 ok here are some of mine.  

Star Wars will flop and all of Disney's future plans for the franchise are scrapped it becomes the biggest flop of all time. 

Furious 7 will be another smash hit in the fast and furious franchise spawning 3 more sequels. set for release in 2017,2019,2021 respectively. 

Avengers age of ultron will top  avatars 2 billion dollars at the Box office. the huge success will cause marvel to change some of its phase 3 plans and bring avengers infinity war part 1 forward to 2017 and part 2 in 2018. The other films will have their dates shifted slightly but phase 3 will remain intact. 

Ant-Man will be a surprise hit. Marvel will announce a sequel but will not give a release date. Many will suspect it wont be released until phase 4. 

In February Marvel and Sony announce that Spiderman will return to marvel with a new trilogy of films, the first film will be announced for 2017 starring Andrew Garfield, Garfield will also feature in avengers infinity parts 1 and 2 with a cameo in Captain America: Civil War. As part of the deal sony will get a portion of the box office earnings.  

The Avatar sequels finally begin principal photography in Wellington, New Zealand. 

After the huge success of the final hobbit film. At comic con 2015 Warner bros announces a middle earth cinematic universe.Peter Jackson will be the creative visionary behind the universe he will be the WB version of Kevin Feige, the first film will be a trilogy of films based on the origin of the Witch King of Angmar the first film would release in 2017. 

At comic con 2015 warner bros announces that batman v superman is split into 2 films with part 1 releasing in October and part 2 in march. 

Fantastic Four is another surprise hit. making around $450 million at the box office. Fox is slightly disappointed but they still go a head with the sequel and believe they can make this new iteration of Fantastic Four into a money making franchise.  




 What an awesome movie. Beautifully shot. Especially the fight scene at the end reminded me a bit of the neo vs smith fight from the matrix with the rain and lightning in the background. So good.  This movie may have rebooted Keanu Reeves career in the best way possible. Lets hope he takes advantage of this success and we see him in more of these roles.  




 yea boi! NZ bros! 




 Doesnt this line from stark basically confirm he's the one who makes ultron? 









 I think the recording is gonna play a big part in the trial now.  









 Im going on holiday in Bali for a week in February from the 11th to the 18th which means Ill be missing out about a week of my course. Since I receive living costs and have an active Student Loan, will I need to contact them even though its just a week?  




 Comes out in April for me! so hyped.  




 April master race! so hyped! 




 yea it is.  









 Since bay is apparently out, they will need to having someone already working on it if they plan to make the projected 2016 release date. Any ideas who they might of picked? 




 Ive had it on my battle net account for a while but never bothered to give it a try. is it any good? worth trying out? 




 Furious 7.  




 There's still time to announce a delay.  




 I like how it acknowledges that its a parody of a Hollywood blockbuster. 




 it's not in the same universe so it doesn't matter.  




 Hes got a very particular set of skills,skills he has acquired over a very long career. so why not use them? let him do taken 4 imo 




 After seeing Whiplash I think he could pull it off. At times his character felt very isolated and was dealing with his own personal issues just like peter parker does and he played that very well. Not sure how well he would pull off spiderman tho. I've only seen him in whiplash so maybe someone else can chime in with their thoughts.  




 This just getting ridiculous and out of hand. Poor bloke needs help.  




 you can see the detail must be running at ultra, 4k, 60 fps. 









 you'd be surprised what they spoil in trailers these days. I would not be surprised at all if they spoiled something like that and used it as the big money shot of the trailer.  




 that makes no sense? if the game is on steam then the keys should be able to activate on it? 




 you know hes probably joking about buying the game right? 




 if its not delayed we should get something within the next 2 weeks. tho knowing rockstar we might not get anything till the day it comes out.  




 there's still 2 weeks till release calm your tits.  




 That is clean.  




 I check it every 5 minutes! 




 im talking about sam betraying rogers to team up with stark in civil war. This has nothing to do with Hydra.  




  .

that could actually make a really cool plot. Imagine the look of betrayal on rogers face when his second best friend next to buck betrays him. 




 You have to remember that what happens to Odin all depends whether or not Anthony Hopkins decides to return for Thor: Ragnarok.If he returns then obviously he could be alive just in Odin sleep or if he doesnt return then they have an excuse to kill him off.  




 I actually like SC 2013 come at me bro 




 DAMN IT I FELL FOR IT! 




 Shouldn't the game have gone gold by now? why haven't we heard anything about the pc version finishing development? 




 we just got the witcher 3 requirements and that's not out till May. Something is going on here and I don't like the Silence.  




 Does anyone find it weird steam still says early 2015 and not january 27th? Normally games this close to release have a countdown showing how much time their is till release. Maybe rockstar isnt putting january 27th on the steam page in case they do need to delay?  




 Been a while since I last heard news about it. Is it still happening? 




 your doing it wrong man. i live in New Zealand and never pay more than $65 for a new release game. And games are expensive as shit here. Thank GabeN for online Key stores.  




 what on GabeN's earth is this? no offence but this is a terrible build. You can do a lot better for that price. Hope you didnt buy this yet. This one is better. http://pcpartpicker.com/b/ZB9WGX 




 Dude Ikr! the GOW1 port is so good. It runs really well. Makes me sad Cliffy B never put the second or third game on pc cause of pirating.  




 we need to show developers that we support pc games. Too many developers are scared of putting their games on pc cause of people downloading them and if we ever want halo or gears of war back on pc gta v will need to do well in sales to convince other developers that the pc game market is still strong and that its worth the time and money to have an extra team during development to make a pc port.  









 I remember back in high school stealing chocolate bars from my local super market and putting them down mah pants...back in the day. I was young and shit and quite the rebel to ,hehe.i remember being pretty good at it to tbh. I also remember getting away with some whipped cream and later spraying some of it all over some poor buggers car and then threw it down a ditch some where on my home. I also remember getting a way with a copy of Command and Conquer tiberian sun from a local computer store. 




 This movie is awesome.I loved the animation and Baymax was an awesome character. Hope they do a sequel and this is easily in my top 10 movies of 2014. 




 Na the ending will more than likely involve ether Fury,Stark or Rogers visiting him and offering him to join the avengers.  




 All disney have said is holiday 2015 so around the time the force awakens is released.  




 use pcsx2 and play em? 




 up vote for dat edginess.  




 After seeing whiplash him being in spiderman 2 made me appreciate that movie a little more.  




 Before Iron Man 3 came out I remember reading that Disney decided against using the Demon in a bottle story line and went with PTSD instead.Any idea why it didn't make the final cut? I'm still kinda hoping we get some hints or nods of Demon in a bottle in future films especially with Civil   Infinity War coming up.  









 ill probably get downvoted for this but wouldnt it be bad for their sponsorship with antec to do this? 




 Damn the reference cooler is sexy as hell.  









 your cpu is a bit of a bottle neck.  




 this is my favorite part of attack of the clones.  









 I would of also cut the joke at the end about changing the name. it still ruins a other wise seriously toned trailer. But other wise good job :) 




 This looks awesome! There is no stopping marvel now boys!  




 These things are pointless imo.  




 Isn't it supposed to be out by now? 




 because it would of been weird. seeing the guy who's gonna be vision in the future playing a character in the past 




 Maybe next year ill get a 4k TV. Hopefully by then they'll drop in price.  


































 everything looks great except for Iron Mans suit. Looks so photo shopped.  









 Titanic. But If I had to pick a recent score It would have to be Interstellar.  




 Its all about taste and all film is subjective. Your not going to like every single film.  









 just watching 1080p youtube videos id probably use that up in a few days.  









 Thor dies, Cap then gets to use the hammer? 




 I guess that makes sense. But Id hope that we would be able to figure out a way around that limiation.  



















 Oh god. this movie is gonna suck.  




 I think its been put on the shelf for now. My guess is Fox will wait and see how FF does before revisting it since Josh Trank will have also signed on to direct FF2. So we may not get a sequel till after FF2 and even then Trank has his star wars movie to do. So if Chronicle 2 does happen it wont be directed by Trank.  




 is that including spectre or still 2 more after spectre? 




 Ok seriously can we stop already?  





























 TL;DR LOL 




 This article is from last year. Old news.  




 If it still turns on you might just need to replace the hard drive. Or the hard drive could of come loose due to the amount of force. Open her up and check.  









 its cheap, constantly updated with new content. Its original content is even better than some of its licensed content (Looking at you House of Cards). Easy to switch regions with a VPN etc. Compatible with lots of devices. Its just that good.  




 Netflix.  














 You could try the Pelangi Hotel in Seminyak  




 Damn that's complicated to look at.  




 Apparently its 145 minutes according to my local cinema. Just in case anyone wanted know.  




 Their laptops are actually decent.  




 Is still shit.  




 If Captain America: Civil War has spider-man I reckon it has a decent chance.  




 So the last episode was called the return and we got a surprise guest apperance from Manu Bennett as slade. The episode implied that Bennet was returning as Slade but he didn't really did he? he ended up back in Prison and imo It was more of a guest apperance than a return. A return to me would of been him escaping so he could of been used later on. I just found the episode title a bit misleading.
 









 Why didn't disney at least give the second one a go before canning the franchise? they could of at least wrapped up the story properly with one more film. And besides, It could of been one of those franchises that picked up steam through dvd,bluray and VOD sales. So much wasted potential. :(  




 A lot of people don't have the technical know how to figure out how to use Netflix,Hulu and torrents etc. Some people still cant afford internet. Also some people just prefer the social aspect of sitting down and watching TV with a bunch of friends rather than being anti social and watching it on a laptop or something. TV is a very social thing for a lot of people.  









 With all the spin offs and what not. When do you think disney will reveal the entire slate? perhaps at star wars celebration?  




 Is anyone else worried that Sony is selling off its TV and smartphone divisions and wants to invest more in PlayStation? I mean what if their investment fails to return a profit in 3-4 years time? would Sony consider selling the PlayStation brand as well? The last thing the gaming industry needs is a monopoly controlled by Microsoft. Nintendo really doesn't have any stake in the industry anymore like MS and Sony currently do. Would you guys still support PlayStation if it was purchased by another brand like Samsung? 














 Oooh season finale perhaps?  




 I mean come on. Do you really think CBS is just gonna let this show end? give it a year or two maybe three. But it will be back in some way. Mark my words this aint the last we've seen of it . 




 The new spider-man actor and director
Captain Marvel director
Infinity War director(s)?
Thor Ragnarok director
Black Panther director
Inhumans director
Confirmation of Spidey in Civil War
Agent Carter season 2
Agents of Shield season 3
New Avengers line up for infinity war

Did I miss anything?
 









 why not just download it all at once? its annoying when you have slow internet. Id rather wait a bit longer but at least be able to play it without interruption.  




 well thats stupid.  




 So I just started playing the order 1866 and I just watched the cut scene after you kill the lycan with the lightning gun and now the game seems to be downloading something again. its currently at 55% and 60 minutes remaining. wtf is going on?
 









 human centipede 




 There should at least be a temporary logo until an official one is released.  



















 its a tv show. the contract wont be that binding like it would for a movie.  




 there's nothing stopping it from happening. That's actually great casting.  




 I wanted spider-man back but not like this. Why move everything? they could of easily had another film in 2017. I'm happy civil war and guardians of the galaxy 2 seem unaffected though.  




 everyone noticed this. Your just late to the party.  




 They wont be taking money from each other. They are both Disney films. Disney would still get money ether way.  




 Why delay any of them? they would still make money. imagine the nerdgasms. Avengers and Star Wars a couple of months apart. Would be madness. But awesome madness.  




 Its not paid DLC for Unity. Its a complete game.  




 Oh god yes! but ONLY if the movie is ready in terms of VFX and editing and what not.  









 Not bad. Looks like your all set to go. Huge fan of those EVGA power supplies. So underrated, more people should use them.  




 So a week from now I'm considering upgrading my graphics card and with the launch of the 960 the price of the 760 will now drop. So I'm wondering do the new feature's and the performance increase of the 960 out way the benefits of a 760? or should I just go with the newer 960.  




 I like pc as much as consoles. Why is it wrong for someone to like both? Not only that I think its stupid to sell a console for a new pc case when the value of the console outweighs the value of a new case.
 




 nope.  




 I don't see how one can film a movie like that with at least some of the cast members feeling awkward on set. I mean what if they down right refused to film a sex scene because of how outrageous it was? I haven't heard anything like that happening for fifty shades just used it as an example. I'm just curious how a director would handle a film like this?  









 that's the most stupid idea ever heard. no way I would sell a ps4 for a case.  




 I can never understand these posts. if its your money just buy the damn case.  




 Netflix gets new episodes weekly.  




 it will be quicker than dude, have you ever use tpb before? its like 10 minutes tops after it airs.  




 so watch it later on netflix? 




 I think an official discussion then a late comers discussion would be good. But it might be a bit too much for the mods.  









 I mean unless they go back in time some how it doesn't make sense but this is moffat we are talking about how so ofc nothing is as it seems.  









 Walter White. All he wanted to do was secure a future for his family before he died and the only way he could think of doing that was by cooking meth.  









 Im more interested in the process behind how marvel got to where they are today. I really enjoyed how star wars conquered the universe because of that reason it went so in depth into how star wars got to where it is today.  









 So get this, In the newest trailer there is a shot of Jason stathams Ian Shaw blowing up a car, next shot you see Dominic looking all sad at a photograph of his family .I think Shaw kills Brian and Universal is hiding it pretty damn well. What do you think? Here's the sequence im talking about. http://imgur.com/a/s10Zi now this could be just the way the trailers cut but it seems kinda obvious now that Shaw will kill someone close to Dom whether its Brian I cant say for sure but why else have that shot with the family photo with Brian in the center? 




 aye you see them plenty in both of the trailers. calm down. They are a major part of the plot they were even in the winter soldier post credit scene.  




 I might have been living under rock but I haven't seen this yet. Should I check it out? 




 that was more of a joke than a controversy tbh. North Korea just got Butt hurt someone decided insult their great leader.  




 I would of thought Selma would of gotten more controversy due the subject of the film but man American Sniper, It seems like every day a new article pops up adding more fuel to the fire. Are there any films as controversial as American Sniper? 




 it was announced by fox ages ago along with a march 2017 release date for another wolverine sequel.  




 Since when do you tip Pizza deliveries? we dont in NZ.  




 Heading there on Wednesday for the first time. Staying for a week. Any thing a first time visitor should do and places to check out? 




 I liked interstellar's theory on this. In the movie they claim that the U.S faked the moon landings to bankrupt the soviet union.  



















 Did a quick Google didn't find anything.  



















 Poltergeist. If you never want to sleep again.  




 you wot m8? your complaining about 250fps? wow.  









 . Windows server 2008 data center can handle up to 2tb of ram.

 It might go better than you think it will. I've heard stories of  EVGA sending back newer models of their card because its no longer in production. You might get back ether a 760 or 960.  




 actually can its called IGN 




 GTX 960.  









 Yep lol.  




 CW YOU HAVE FAILED THIS CITY! 




 Oh yes. That star trek trailer was amazing. The way they cut the trailer to Freedom Fighters from Two Steps From Hell. Still gives me chills.  




 I got mine from study link. Here in New Zealand .Its basically a subsidiary set up by the government and offers interest free student loans. You can also get a student allowance which is free but is dependent on how much money your parents make which will impact how much you get per week. Or you can get living costs which you have to pay back on top of your student loan up to $175 a week.  














 Good way to look at imo. The i7 will be able to play newer games longer than the i5.  




 eh? both are solid ports imo. They did have resolution issues at launch but I'm pretty sure they have been patched now.  



















 I cant take anyone seriously when they start their argument with "fuck" 









 All film is subjective. Gourlami is allowed to like wolverine origins if he wants.  




 I love that line. Don't know why. Just do.  




 Damn this looks good. Might be more hyped for this than Age of Ultron.  




 its still too early. It aint out till march next year.  









 Aint happening, any talk of a sequel died when the abysmal box office numbers came in for the second film.  




  Im guessing with Age of Ultron? I'm seriously hyped for this movie. I want to see more.  









 Since Marvel don't seem interested to back a big budget film for the Hulk, why not go the Netflix route? Del Toro was already working on a live action tv show for ABC haven't heard anything in a while tho. Maybe they could jump start it again now that they have Ruffalo? 




 I cant find any copies online and normally its up by now. Anyone know whats going on? it did air today right? 
























 Well this is interesting. 

http://blog.ubi.com/ubisoft-quebec-studio-spotlight/ 









 lol bs pics or it didn't happen.  




 if you compare the figure on the far left to how Paul actually looks in the scenes he did manage to get filmed you'll see he looks nothing like the figure. The figure is far to thin and the head just looks wrong. plus its awkwardly placed away from the rest of the cast. It must be one of his brothers who then had their head switched out with Paul's during post.  














 Its beautiful.  




 did you even watch the first movie? Dom and his crew were pulling of heists all the time like stealing dvd players and shit.  




 Big hero 6 




 Are people still pissed that superman killed zod? Personally I'm ok with it. I mean, if he didn't kill Zod, Zod would of killed the family and then kept on killing people. Zod left superman no choice. I get that superman killing people is wrong and goes against everything he stands for but I think it was an interesting and ballsy take on the character by Snyder. What do you guys think? 




 So this semester I have to get a laptop. I'm pretty much settled on the Asus ROG G551JM. Just wanted to see what people here thought of asus laptops. Are they of good build? do they last long etc? 




 How does Disney proceed with the franchise? do they keep going and try and make episode 8 better? or do they scrap the franchise completely? id assume they would keep going because they've poured to much money in to it already it would be pointless to stop.  









 2 years is the norm for marvel films, whats so unusual about it? 3 years your starting to get the point where fans will be complaining there taking too long.  




 Jaws 




 Best thing would be some chocolate bars, and whipped cream.  














 I think you should wait for amd to announce the 300 series. the 300 series might end up being better than the Nvidia's 900 series. Dont just jump on the nvidia bandwagon because everyone else is . Just my 2 cents.  









 we run windows. Decent size screen would be nice 15.6-17inch, light to medium gaming so some mobas,cs go, f2p games like nosgoth, the ocasional AAA title like tomb raider etc. No special ports required. Portability would be nice i don't want anything to heavy.  









 Doesn't that defeat the purpose of having an i7? I thought i7's were meant to be quad cores?  




 I'm not afraid to admit that ive done this, a few of my facebook posts ive posted were to try and make me seem cool but I failed pretty hard.  




 I've had a couple of pavilion laptops over the past 4 years both died due to over heating issues. Is this still a thing? or should the pavilion line up be avoided like the plague and is it worth stepping up to the Hp's envy laptops? 





























 Stephen king's the dark tower comes to mind. I have little faith the movie will be any good if and when ever it gets made its just so complex.  




 I mean why does avatar need 3 god damn sequels and we cant get one battle angel movie :(  




 Apollo 13 




 Looking for something that takes a scientific approach yet has all the fun of a good ghost scary ghost hunt. 

 




 How are they not done filming yet? WTH.  









 No, they clearly state that recommended specs will run at 30. Read again. All tho they say they are aiming for the most performance possible for now it looks like recommended specs will run at 30.  




 Here's the link to the original polish interview. 

http://www.gry-online.pl/S018.asp?ID=1132


PC recommended specs will be able to run the game on 30 or 60 frames per second? 

I think, we'll stick with 30 FPS. We're not going to stop working on performance until the very end, it's crucial matter to us, there are different PCs with different specs. Programmers insisted on avoiding tricking the players by lowering predicted specs. As I mentioned before, It can only get better. 









 You sure that's it? I thought it was the plane that looked like the plane bane used from the dark knight rises? 




 should of got it directly from steam 




 yea its bullshit. 









 Ok I stand corrected. But usually the oscars do seem to prefer the higher rated films.  




 My computer will probably catch fire trying to play this.  




 I loved episode 3. Saw it 5 times when it came out. I still get chills when Anakin turns to the dark side.  




 It wasn't rated high enough on rotten tomatoes. sad but true. The oscars seem to favor movies rated 85-100% anything lower doesnt get recognized.  









 err how does she know when its your birthday? 




 what did she do then? when she found out one of her kids did it? 




 I have a 360,Wii,Ps3,Ps4,Xbox one and I think I have an N64 and PS2 around some where. Plus my gaming pc ofc. 




 same, here's how Id do it. At the end of AOU Banner is shot into space after cap and falcon break him out of a government holding cell set up by stark after banner looses control of the hulk, cap tells banner that its the only way hell remain free but cap tells banner hell call upon him when hes needed again.Eventually his craft crashes into Knowhere, Banner makes his way out of the crashed craft he looks up we see groot smiling at him and he says I am groot, end scene.  









 That's bullshit, I mean unless said third party stole the keys then they should be legit. wtf Ubisoft.  




 Anyone got a decent 24/7 OC going on this card? looking to OC to try and improve performance on some newer games that are coming out.  




 Ant-Man got pushed forward from November to July.  




 Wow. That's huge! Paramount must be well ahead of schedule for a drastic move like this.  




 I think this scene is really important. It tells you up front what phase 2 is about. It even foreshadows the events that occurred in the winter soldier with hydra being mentioned and how they will use weapons of mass destruction on civilians.  









 I preodered it you mad.  




 we don't know this yet, Bucky could still play a major role in civil war especially if stark finds out he killed his father.
