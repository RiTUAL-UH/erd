 Conscious because they are alive, and instinctively do what is necessary to maintain that life. They are instinctual because everything they do is driven by primal need. Nothing outside of instinctive behavior exists for the animal. There isn't much room for debate here.

I think we are perhaps saying the same thing but just in different words. Yes, the property of free will cannot be taken away from a human being, it is an intrinsic part of it. A property if you will. But what I meant to say is that this free will can be curtailed, limited or impeded (whichever choice of words you prefer). And by this I mean to say exactly your last point: I will to jump in the air and fly, but that is impossible. I "wish" to, but laws do not permit this. This shows that man is subject to a higher law, or Will.. if you will. 
I may in fact decide to jump off a cliff in defiance. I am free to do so. But the consequences will likely be fatal because there is a higher Will that will not permit me to do so.

To be quite honest, i forget how we got here. Wait, what were we talking about to begin with? Right, taking away a persons free will (or, as you'd prefer, restraining acts of will, is sometimes the only way to ensure compliance).
 




 Prove the existence of my deity? You presume that I have even the minutest interest in convincing you of a fact, for which you already hold a contrary, rigid, and obstinate opinion about.
No sir. That is your issue entirely. I hold no qualms about how you wish to spend your time on this or that. But I gather you will rather converse with other equally ignorant and arrogant religious fanatics, which atheism is only just the converse since you have no proof of your faith either.
Spare me, your comment is so clich . It is naive and childish to assume you can cleverly and subtly imply that I do not hold a stronger command of language, logic and reasoning than you do. Not to claim that I do, but next time you wish to give yourself a false air of superiority, at least do so in a novel manner.
 




 I think you are forcing the argument in your last statement. Everyone in jail doesn't wish to be there. Fundamentally, they have surrendered their free will for the duration of their sentence. They must abide by certain rules and regulations. Consider, how can their will be free when it is subject to a very confined set of rules, especially what and when to eat, sleep and where they may or may not go?
Your argument implies that slavery also doesn't take away a persons free will. Actually, by your definition, nothing can since unless you are bound and gagged, you can still apply your logic and assert that there is no loss of free will.
Do you see what I am getting at?

Secondly, you are right in a certain way in the first part of your comment. All of these creatures do not have the free will that the human spirit is endowed with. However, this is not to mean that they are not conscious, they are not self-conscious. And they operate and instinctively follow laws which indicate how they must exist. So they can never be wrong or bad in that sense. This is why many seeing ones in the past point to observing the animals to discover where and how we err with respect to natural laws. 




 So do animals have free will? Do viruses and bacteria? Are they morally correct or wrong given your framework? 
Morality is not arbitrary, it is fixed. Mans understanding of it is what varies. 
People who are unable to coexist with themselves and other creatures in equilibrium do not deserve to chose. They must be checked until they learn to act otherwise. Unless you think correctional facilities do not exist where a person surrenders his free will until he is deemed fit to regain it. 




 You are right. And you are wrong.
Correlation does not imply causality, but since randomness is impossible, we either admit our ignorance, or work with what we can understand at the time.
I don't think a Supreme being will have the time to meddle in the affairs of man. He will likely have setup automatic laws that run everything without Him having to interfere with anything except it extraordinary and rare cases. 
So you are right in that it is prickly for one to punish and act arbitrarily as is wrongly attributed to Him, but when has man ever had the right conception of anything?
I submit that there are immutable and inviolable laws in place that govern everything automatically. Making this world we live in a sophisticated, fully automatic, work of perfection. These laws are observable physically as gravity, attraction, and reciprocity. Of course, the non physical manifestations do nit differ principally, but only in the outer form. 

For example, physically you may observe the law of reciprocity when you sow wheat or corn. You end up with a multiplied return or harvest. One grain of wheat yielding multiple grains, and likewise corn. But always of the same nature of the seed that was down. One seed, multiplied harvest.
Applied to the non material: each thought, word, or deed is subject to same. Taking deed for example, deeds of a specific nature will always only return same, but in abundance: kindness yields kindness, love, hate, envy, malice, cruelty, lustfulness, jealousy, wickedness, etc. Multiple forms, same perfectly ordered process.

So it is simple and clear that when man reaps whatever harvest, it is always and only that which he himself has placed in the mechanism that is returned to him unfailingly. There is no deviation or change in this, as such a thing would imply imperfection, which is absolutely out of the question. Just like gravity: it is perfectly consistent in its working. You will never find any deviation. In the operation of gravity! It is inviolable, immutable, and perfect in its working. So also are the other laws which rest in, govern, and  sustain everything that exists, and to which all that exist is subject, including man. 









 I was of the same opinion not too long ago. But if you unassumingly examine yourself, you will find that interacting with superficial people will leave a minute impression on you. And this builds over time. 




 Perhaps I don't understand your question. But I'll do my best to answer.
As I have progressed through life (progression here meaning gotten older, advancing in all else will be a matter of stiff debate) I've found fewer and fewer people who see things the same way.
So my circle of friends is very small. I find it highly unbearable being around people who spend time talking about the most inconsequential, superficial things. So yes, I agree. Not very many people.
This doesn't bother me. What does is thinking one is a victim of chance or that one has no input on how things play out. Which I believe is not supported by evidence. I believe there are laws that govern every happening. They are the same as the laws that direct the flow of water and air, invisible microwaves etc. It is all a uniform, gigantic mechanism. This is how I see the world. A mighty machine that we understand a bit more about every day.
This understanding will be severely checked however, if we are to make assumptions about things being random, and just chance happenings. This is very remindful of how religion chooses to keep power by ensuring its congratulation remains largely, if not entirely, naive... 




 Excellent point. I apologize since I see no separation between philosophy, science or anything else that is real. They are all derivatives of mathematics anyway and so are subject to the same principles albeit in a different form.
Sorry for veering off topic but I quite disagree that a car accident is random. Yes they happen to many people usually out of carelessness or what have you. But that any person x can get crushed under a car does not agree with my logic of causality.
In this universe there are causes and effects. I believe nothing exists outside of these two things... At least within our universe anyway.
Thanks for the interesting conversation, I will reflect on what you have so kindly shared. 




 Again cite your facts sir. You are projecting your narrow views as though I should just accept them as facts. You need to prove them first. 




 I think I can say the same for you. Its usually a tactic used by one who has nothing to offer in form of counter argument.
You responded to non of the facta and examples I gave. And instead took the 'high' road. 




 Thank you.
I think the idea that it would be different does give room for exciting what ifs. But the observations I indicate do not exclude the what ifs.
There is a myriad of possibility even within the laws that we understand. Consider the many different races even on earth. The diversity of the language.
The physical structures, etc. Imagine how much more variation there would be in human forms in a different planet. But they will all have that optimal configuration. Just differently adapted to the environment as you allude to. Like height, size (think giants), speed, agility, flexibility, etc.
It is a much richer and actually more practically modeled realm of thinking since we have a working basis and principle upon which our model can be tested, refuted etc. 




 In reading your response, it sounds like you completely agree with me. But then you default your conclusion to your preconceived idea. The examples of random occurrences which you have cited are actually not random at all. As you rightly said: we just cannot understand the underlying process yet. That is in no way suggestive of it being random.
I submit that since we have established this fact in the larger things, it must be the same uniform operating principle in all things. Why? I'm sure you can reason this out logically for yourself.
The largest tree follows the same basic process and laws as the minutest multicellular plant, same with animals of which man is a very special of shoot (I say this for the lack of a better word because man is in no wise the same as animal. They merely share the same biological equipment -body).
You have no proof to indicate that somehow the process should be different and random with small things. On the contrary we have many observable examples showing the same basic process/laws repeated in all things great and small.
I think it is a much more logical conclusion, if even in the absence of case specific evidence, to assume that nothing is excluded from this norm, which we are able to observe in everything we have come to understand so far.  




 Please cite your morality source. And while you do, I'd like you to acknowledge that it is a subjective definition. Put together and agreed upon by what we can all agree is a poorly advanced and highly ignorant masses (as is demonstrated daily).
So, while your argument is solid, it is solidly based on a flawed assumption of what morality is understood to be. I for one do not agree with your interpretation of morality so I can not accept your claim.
Perhaps if you base your claim on a more fundamental universally accepted fact, then I may be inclined to follow your reasoning. 




 Let me ask you, can you think of anyone or group of people, or entire nations that have shown so much incompetence that, for their safety and survival, as well as for those who exist around them, they should be absolutely controlled perhaps 2/3rds of the time?
Just think about this very deeply, not superficially and you will find countless examples of such persons or people. After a bit of reflection, you will see that in some not very well executed way, this is how children are raised. This is how the correctional facilities were designed to function. This is what happened in Germany during the world war.
This is what needs to happen in the middle east!
So yes, while I agree with you that it appears wrong, this thought is only apparent. Look at how peacefully the otherwise unruly guys were able to coexist. Instead of spending their days drinking and harming one another at night, the work together productively. And they even voluntarily submit to this because they see that it is better for them.
Your assessment is the common reaction by most people who haven't deeply reflected on the matter. 




 Please can you cite this assertion?
There is nothing random about survival. Only the strong survive. This way, they are able to reproduce and pass on the optimized genetic encoding for the next generation. So that only the strong is propagated in both prey and hunter.
The planet did not just assume a temperature, the temperature is formed by the contents of the planet. And therefore adjusts accordingly. As the contents change through optimal driven adaptation, so does the planets conditions (temp, air, etc).
Mutation is not random, that is fantasy. All changes are adaptation. Viral and bacterial mutation are never random, they are adaptive. So is all mutation. Again there is no proof of randomness. Even a random number generator is not random since it is an algorithm. In reality there is nothing random. The appearance of randomness is only apparently so because we lack the proper understanding to comprehend the inner working. Think of all the ill-understood processes which science considered random but have since been revised when scientific observation is able to comprehend the process. 




 Well, the theory lends itself to that primary assumption as well. All life on earth is based on carbon. The question is why? Is it possible for life to be based on anything else? And even if so, i submit that carbon is the optimal configuration (atomically) upon which life can be built.
This implies that any and all life, wherever it may be will follow the same exact configuration based on what is optimal. In the same way, requirements for life and sustenance follow the same principle. So that in reality, were you to some how be transported to this alien world, you probably may not even notice because the same things will likely be repeated there as well.
Does this make sense? Why do you assume and assert that they will have a different atmosphere? air pressure, and flora etc? The question we should ask is can life be sustained otherwise?  









 Wait, let me get this straight. So we accept that aliens may or may not exist. But that if they do, they can have these impossible size or characteristics such as odd colors, 4 legs, etc. Much of which I believe is ludicrous by the way.
But then this idea of a winged animal able to generate some form of combustion through its airways is outlandish?
Let me give examples of animals that should not exist based on your reasoning:
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2185313/Monsters-deep-British-filmmaker-wrestles.html
These are just a small sample of sea animals. Many of whom will soon become extinct, and closed minded people such as yourself will quickly banish them to the realm of fantasy and fairy-tale.  




 I am still not past the assumption that they would be any different from the people you see around you. I don't really understand why they have to absolutely look different.
I believe we are configured this way because it is optimal for our species. 
Based on what we can observe, the laws under which the universe operates, which we are trying to understand through the sciences of physics, chemistry and biology etc, (which are really only observation of what is out there) is present everywhere.
All the celestial bodies, of which the earth is one of billions, operate under the same uniform laws. 
I believe it is just naive to think that randomness is responsible for anything. There is no randomness observed here on earth (except people and their childish nature) but by and large, everything operates under strict laws. If this is so, then i would expect aliens to look exactly as we do! 




 I met my wife at a seminar. And she into anime and ask the games I loved as a kid. Seriously though, you will also find the same type of women in the plus size section as you would in any other section, haven't you figured that out yet?
Let me help you. Think of all the idiots you've met your entire life (male or female), do they all fall in any one section? There's your answer. 




 I'm a computer scientist, but it grinds my gears that the term 'singularity' has been given an ill-fitting meaning. 

"A gravitational singularity or spacetime singularity is a location where the quantities that are used to measure the gravitational field become infinite in a way that does not depend on the coordinate system. These quantities are the scalar invariant curvatures of spacetime, which includes a measure of the density of matter."

Can we come up with a better term to describe a fully independent form of AI?  




 Actually, they managed to show one side as being completely wrong ALL the time. And how until the very end, we assumed the same. The humans were wrong ALL the time. ALL of it. So it wasn't the case that both sides were right and wrong. One side was right. One side was always right. And one side was wrong, that side was ALWAYS wrong!
I really enjoy your emphasis on the fact that Will consciously attacked weapons and never the humans. 




 No. I believe they were the ones playing God actually.
All the machine was doing was largely undoing the heap of mess humans had created in their self delusion that they were gods.. 




 I couldn't help but notice this too.
And to be exact here: being a computer programmer does not in any way give you some 'expert' understanding of this movie or the practical and theoretical aspects of AI. It is a computer 'science' related field and is largely in the realm of research. And from my experience, most, if not all researchers are not programmers. Which isn't to mean that they couldn't unleash beautiful lines of code. There just isn't time to focus on that sort of thing.
So AI has little to do with programming and more to do with concepts in logic or machine learning. 




 It is very interesting your comment: "like minded drones"
I think that all successful people are the same. They are like 'like minded drones'. The idea is that people who have found the perfect way of being, will more than likely appear dull, like minded, and as though they were drones. But they only appear that way to those who have yet to achieve the same level. 
Food for thought. 




 That there was only one other upvote on your comment shows how very lost and shallow most people are. This is the deepest movie I have seen this year or perhaps in the past decade.
In fact, I believe the depth of this movie goes far beyond your description.
You can take this from a religious or spiritual angle as well:
Every happening where a prophet, or let us take Christ for example, came to mankind to help them, the end result was always the same. In their superficial 'always-wanting-to-know-better', they rejected such help. Scorned, plotted and had such a one eliminated (usually through suffering and death).
Now, play back Transcendence and you will see the same. The ego-maniacal conceit of human beings is laid bare in this movie. Here we have a being who, armed with all the knowledge of how everything works and can fit together, shows them a way that is best for them. But, in their self delusion created by the conceit of thinking oneself of always-knowing-better, they convince themselves that this person is dangerous and that his motives are selfish etc.
Imagine the irony that this is in fact a perfect example of humanity today. You will hear superficial claims of wanting peace, harmony, a perfect world. But if you would dare to lead them in such a direction, well, you need only look at history to understand your fate at the hands of humanity.
Thanks for the review. I hope my small addition makes sense. 




 Restrain your tongue half-ling. Nobility demands a bird's eye view. No self-respecting man will hide as a toilet when he can confine himself in the ceiling. 




 Here is a thought:
Nothing in my post here indicated or alluded to anything of 'sexual' intercourse, which is purely a physical affair. It is only hear on earth, on this material plane where sexual intercourse is to be found. It is also on this plane that you will find sexual organs for reproduction.
This can not be difficult to understand. So, once again, if you understand that there is no occurrence of this on other parts of creation, then it is logical to conclude that differences arising from activity related to physical activity will not exist either.
This does not contradict anything of what I have said. It does however, highlight the need for me to state explicitly that I am referring here to spiritual activity. It is in the nature of this spiritual activity that certain physical changes occur. That is, if a person of female gender distorts herself, then this will have damages that will eventually manifest in some later physical part that renders the person useless both spiritually and physically. Which is an ejection mechanism in creation that you can clearly observe everywhere if you look for it.
 




 Like a plague, this ignorance has spread everywhere with rapidity that barely conceals the motive force behind it: darkness. The idea of equality has been twisted and perverted so that it is as though it stands on its head. Yes, woman is no less valuable than man. On the contrary, she stands higher than man spiritually because in her delicate nature, she forms the bridge through which spiritual currents streaming from on high can be received and dispensed to man. Without which everything must fall to ruin. Or why do you think Lucifer, who once an Arch angel, had a perfect understanding of the laws that govern all happenings in creation. He knew, that in order to cause the fall of the whole, he needed only to cut off man from the Light. And his attack on the human woman, depicted in the Bible, showed precisely how, in so doing man was destined to follow once she, the guardian of the flame, fell. 

Male and female are both equal. There is balance in this as in everything in creation. This is expressed in the equal armed Cross, who's beams are of equal length: the vertical representing positive, active, masculine activity, and the horizontal representing negative, passive, feminine activity. Their activities are different. It is not for nothing that their bodies and constituent organs are different anatomically? If two tools differ in appearance, does it not imply then that they are meant for different activity?

This is a delusion created by the vanity that infects the female gender today (and the males too). Yes, wrongly, women have been treated unequally and their work and activity considered unimportant and to be of less value as their male counterpart. But instead of elevating the feminine (passive) activity to one of equal value and importance, female human beings, in the name of "progress", want to take on masculine activities. Can you see the contradistinction between the two? While the latter bears semblance to the goal: equality, it is only apparently so because it leads to a perversion! The former however, is the correct way to restore balance, that is, raising the passive, feminine activity of woman to a level equal in value to that of man.

This clearly does not endorse a mixing of the two.
Let us examine an example. Picture to yourself, two knives. One a serrated blade, and the other having a smooth blade. Without debate, we conclude that both are knives and of equal value in the workshop (value meaning they are both useful for the purpose of cutting a piece of material). My first claim is that they are fundamentally different in their structure and construction in such a way as to indicate the nature of their activity. This difference however, gives a clue as to what activity each type of knife is meant for. One for cutting through rough, fibrous densities and the other for more even, finer densities. 

We may choose to use either knife for the cutting that material (activity) meant for the other. One will perhaps get away with doing this once or twice without causing any permanent damage. But a continued, persistent abuse in this manner will ultimately damage the knifes edges. The result is that it becomes completely useless for any profitable activity in the workshop. Having lost its smoothness or serrated-ness at the edges, it can now no longer function properly. Unable to cut either smooth or fibrous material, it becomes useless and must be done away with.

Now, picture before your mind's eye countless other examples in creation and you will find no end to the number of such examples that follow the same logical operating principles. Then we can safely assert that this is a law of nature. Whereby we can assert that given any fruit of nature (be it man, beast, or material form - plants, earth, rocks, waters etc), the form (i.e. the manner in which it is constructed, including internal anatomy) distinctly bears witness to the nature of its activity. An activity of which, once changed, will damage this form resulting in the fruit becoming useless and ultimately being done away with.

Such is the nature of creation. Men or women who, in their thinking themselves better, in their ego-maniacal obstinate belief that the laws of creation should bend to their will, believe that the obvious differences in the construction of the body of both sexes is immaterial, and therefore choose to indulge in activity and behavior akin to the opposite sex incessantly, will ultimately damage the bodies entrusted to them. That is, effemination, or masculinization will result in the lose of those qualities, which are characteristic of the particular gender. Resulting in the inability to function properly. These deluded ones become sterile males and barren women. This is natures way of 'doing away with,' because such human beings have become useless for any spiritually profitable purpose in this great workshop of creation! 




 The enigmatic delay of springs arrival in the United States had astonished the population in general. There were fewer flowers, a lot of snow and heavy showers, unsurprisingly these are the climatic changes affecting the entire planet at the moment, nevertheless what really left a deep scar this spring was the inexplicable tragedy that took place at University of Virginia Technical College, where a young South Korean student, Cho Seung-Hui, in an act of insanity killed 32 people and then shot himself.

In general saddened people are asking why do tragedies of this nature happen at all. Professors, psychologists and authorities are hard struck at making sense of it all, all the same they are only able to console the population with some reassuring words without facing the real cause of this tragic event.

With the passing of time mankind in general has chained itself exclusively to terrestrial concepts of time and space, consequently labeling itself as being materialistic due to its sole dependence on physical and visible evidence, as a direct result of this all thought matter ends up being retained at the lowest sphere of creation, as if there was nothing else other than what is visible to the physical eye. Thus, much of what is essential to a greater understanding of the things that surround us has been placed aside because it has become incomprehensible, as the necessary effort that needs to be made so that these events can be understood cannot be duly processed as should be.

Endowed with a developed brain and with the capacity to form thought processes we have grown accustomed to consider our day to day thoughts as something that belongs to a private leisure zone; free to do as one pleases with no consequences.

What happens when we think? What happens when we nourish thoughts of the same thought species? The thoughts are formed in our brain as a consequence of our inner desires. The brain should always be commanded by the inner desire, but by being disconnected from it, it has consequently developed an independent will of its own that has grown to be more easily subject to external influences.

If a person feels envious and the urge to covet overtakes the thought forms, and the person does not interrupt this negative feeling, soon thoughts of this nature arise in the mind that begin to be attract to other similar thought forms. Consequently it too gets attracted to others similar in nature to it originating from existing thought formations from millions of other people of the same thought pool, and all of this thought activity ends up fortifying ones negative desires of the same though species.

It has already been proved that feelings and thoughts can exercise an influence over other elements including water, thus thought forms are not just limited to having an influence over other humans.

Let us imagine that thoughts are like deposits made into a bank account. That is, they are left by the person in a place where their thought forms accumulate in an unattainable place to the common eye. If they are thoughts of hate and revenge they remain there in the bank account of the depositor, and they are added to a global joint account of hate thoughts independently from where they have been dispatched.

Then some person comes along that has a similar desire and unknowingly wants to cash in a check in his or her possession. That is, it will be a person that has in its inner-self a large reserve of hate, but through neglect, has allowed this sentiment to grow. This would be the same as exposing ones-self to receiving an extraordinary charge of hate deposited by the millions of other people spread out throughout the world in this global joint account.

This may have occurred with the young South Korean Cho Seung-Hui. In a fit of hate he opened the global joint account and received an extraordinary discharge of hate that totally dominated his mind, thus blinding him. In a blind rage of hate he did what he did. Destroying his life both on earth as in the beyond, for as of now his soul will wander aimlessly in a pilgrimage of suffering without being able to find inner peace.

The youth pulled the trigger repeatedly killing many people, but together with him pulling that trigger, was the negative energy of hate thoughts of the millions of scornful people. Evidently he was the responsible person, as he used his freewill, but in the same act there was the co-participation of the hate of millions of people that daily feed this global-hate joint deposit account, and with all certainty they also will be affected by the inexorable reciprocity contained in the laws of Creation, be whoever and wherever they are, as they are connected to the event by invisible threads of destiny, that is, they are identified through the global joint deposit account of life and they will not be able to flee from their responsibility.

Evidently our human civilization, now based on an exacerbated individualism and relationships characterized by the desire of domination, is unexpectedly due to be the sole participant is a series of extremely humiliating situations. The availability of firearms, necessary in this present time for self-defense, also favors the increase in violent deaths, but the greatest problem lies in the existence of dissatisfaction with ones own life and an excess of hate generated by humanity.

Less wars, less crimes and less violence will occur when people begin to police their thoughts more seriously, fortifying those of a beneficial and constructive nature, like that of respect and consideration for ones fellow man, love towards all creatures, and a joyous, peaceful and harmonious coexistence, all inevitably originating out of a conviction of gratitude for the marvelous gift of life we have!

 This reads ancient Hebrew to me. It might as well be written in Martian since it makes no difference: no one on earth understands this nonsense. Lawyers do not count. They are death dealers who's only purpose for existing is to decipher complex incomprehensible laws which THEY wrote and they alone can understand!
Okay, rant over. 









 I understand you perfectly. And my comment stands nonetheless. If you doubt this, then you should try this experiment:
In a vacuum, balance a wooden beam of any mass on a point. Then place the spec of dust indicated in your post on the beam and watch what happens.
The laws of nature are simple. Even the finest spec of dust has some weight, and is sufficient to cause an imbalance. That we can't measure or perceive what the effect will be doesn't alter the fact that it exists.  




 And you know this how exactly? It's called balance. The moon is the way it is by reason of design and perfect balance. Changes to its mass, orbit, or anything of the like will surely affect the earth.
Or have you read nothing about lunar microwaves (lunar solar radiation) and how it effectively influences climate condition on every part of the earth.
 




 It was worth reading this far after I read your comment.
I admire Germanic people. I actually admire all people. 
If as people we weren't so superficial, we'd realize that there is so much to admire about the many different races and cultures that occupying ones self with just that will leave no time for such idle talk. 
Open your mind's eye and see the beauty in (and of) all the peoples!
 
























 Why 'your family'. What about the rest of us? Aren't we your family too? What, you don't love us anymore? :'( 




 Why do we need to state this? I can't think of anyone in their right senses who'd want to stop people from having those adorable ornaments 




 For shame! 




 I think this is a cultural thing. Like having a sense of style. 




 I think it's more something like this http://previews.123rf.com/images/gmast3r/gmast3r1203/gmast3r120300078/12769460-handsome-young-business-man-serious-hands-on-waist.jpg 




 Clearly you have put sins thought to this. I guess they will be color coded too?  




 The push intensifies. 









 I don't think that counts as unison anymore..... 




 Why is anyone interested in reading about and hearing the misguided  thoughts of scum?
Be careful what you feed your mind... 




 I think it's how she really sees you. 




 Me three 




 But the tax payer still bears the burden. Which in and of itself isn't a problem. It is the inflated costs dictated by insurance companies that is the problem.
 




 Who is this government you speak of. What you are really saying here, and cleverly trying to conceal, is that Americans are incompetent. Is there a transformation that goes on between private and public sector? Are 'Americans' in private sector a different species than the ones working in the public sector? 
Your argument makes no sense. A system is efficient if it is well funded and managed. When these services are subject to the whims of ideologues, then you have a problem.
How about the banking sector? Can you point me to a government fail even remotely close to the epic fail we witnessed in the banking sector recently? The government may be slow and inefficient, but you can be guaranteed that they are not in it to inflate their personal bank accounts... 




 Actually, they only have mastery over one very very specific thing. But, to obtain such mastery comes the ability to understand many things very quickly. So to Op is basically saying sacrifice verbosity and give a condensed (usually complex) answer, which I can ruminate over. 




 That was decades ago. You're living in it! 




 What did the Dutch ever do to you? 




 The lethargy of all things Nigerian government, characteristic of the outgoing 'lame duck' president of Nigeria (Goodluck Jonathan), seems to wane as the country approaches a monumental political transition. This erstwhile attitude is giving way to a more accountable, disciplined, and responsible attitude, which coincidentally are a hallmark of the incoming president elect, Gen Muhammadu Buhari (rtd). The recent military campaigns have successfully rescued victims of Boko Haram by the hundreds. However, there is much needed help and support from the local and international community. These women and children have been systematically traumatized through rape and torture for years. Much psychological, physical, and economic help and support is needed. Please lend your support through positive thoughts, words, and deeds in form of kind or cash.
~ thank you.

 Learn how to 'read a book'. What flag patch!? 




 First, pointing me to a website is not proof of anything. What was the sample size, is this a global statistic or a study based on subjects in the United States (who are known for their healthy lifestyle).

Second and more importantly, your rebuttal dies not refute anything of what I have stated. You could say, 100% of all births result in death of the individual concerned. What does that actually mean?

My comment stands valid nonetheless. A pregnancy will run its course to its inevitable end. The natural result of which is a birth. Unless you are going to argue that the natural end of a pregnancy is something other than birth, for which you will need to cite something more credible than an internet website. 




 Your logic comparing abortion to organ donation is deeply flawed. One requires an active action or intervention while the other does not. An organ donation is an active intervention and a choice. Do nothing and the person dies. The choice part of a pregnancy is naturally only in the act of procreating. But being pregnant, doing nothing and making no choice, results in something inevitable: birth. You are warping things to fit in with your reasoning, which isn't how logic works.. 




 You mean it turned out not to fit with the hitherto prevailing religious understanding of God. You all who created God yet you are satisfied with finding forces, the origin of which you haven't bothered to ask. 

Perhaps if you think of Him as the Origin, the Source, the Beginning then you a question such as  'who created Him' becomes a wrong question. 

Nothing exists that was not created. Understanding the price behind the creation, which is very different from religious concoctions, does not disproves anything. It only proves that religion was wrong. 




 Your comment is every evidence of how that you have nothing to offer. Now hurry along and be on your way little man. 




 Wow. That's sad. Mine held fine. I did the OTA update to 5.01 a few days ago. And thankfully, it installed successfully. I will be the last to do the next update.
I'm actually contemplating samsung or apple as my next phone... 




 What can or should the average citizen do to make this overturn happen? I've given money, shared links, discussed with friends. Who do we write? What can we do to push this? 




 I forgot to say thanks for the simple, clear, unmuddled description of how you fixed your system! Thank you! 




 I'm not sure I understand what is going on with Google. I am going to demand a refund for my phone since it is still within manufacture warranty. 
How on earth does a company that big release a full operating system that bricks their flagship device. This is an EPIC FAIL! 




 So much color. beautiful. 




 Very interesting. Most people who are stuck on the bible fail to understand the meaning of circular logic. 
How do you convince someone that something is wrong or incorrect or illogical if there is no basis for their belief? Nothing objective to pivot off of. Can you see how this is a self inflicted curse that is almost impossible to break?

Most people are of the opinion that God must be illogical, supernatural and all manner of ignorant ideas.
Quite to the contrary, I think that God is perfectly logical, and a perfection of what we consider natural. If one understands that His Will are expressed in the laws of nature (a small subset of which is recognized by the sciences, ... of which more are recognized daily). 




 Aye cap'n 




 . 




 I have offered you no old book. In fact, i have offered you no book at all.
1. What part of anything I have written indicates that I have, or ever will, offer you an old book? And I am assuming you are referring to the bible here? right?
2. If you are interested in finding something, I suggest you go look for it. Waiting for someone to offer you something is arrogant and assumes that your acceptance of it is somewhat precious or worth the trouble in even the smallest way. Which it is not, that much I can guarantee you.
3. I will refrain from sounding rude here, but from your comment it is clear you haven't a clue what you purport to be: "an atheist is one who lacks religion." Try "disbelief or lack of belief in the existence of God or gods." And if you aren't aware, that belief or disbelief in itself lacks any proof or evidence. So it is a collection of people who share the same baseless belief or 'faith'. That too is a religion, or sect, or cult, or whatever.
You don't have to accept this, I can tell you what you are from your writing. You appear to be one who is either agnostic or just is. You don't have to be anything really. Just what you are, and that is a human being.

My comments on gravity and the natural laws hold nothing of mythical or 'old book' flavor as they are things we see and experience daily. My conclusions that we are subject to these laws and whether or not they have a source, are my personal conclusions. And nothing to do with religion, sects, cults, or schools of belief or the like.

My way, religion, the word, or anything bearing and semblance to organized or group thinking will be abolished and made illegal. Then all will be forced to reason and think freely for themselves.

My logic is not meant to persuade. Persuasion is immaterial and futile. It is internal. Only you can reflect for yourself and come to a conclusion. This will never come from outside. And if it does, then you are a drone. Similar to ISIS, Christians, and other religious fanatics who have been told and are convinced they act in service of some god that wants them to kill and torture others. I offer pictures of things you can assess for yourself and persuade yourself to this or that conclusion. That is all. 
























 1. Why not take out Hitler instead of shipping the Jews? There were a hand full of people pivotal to the Nazi movement, why not just take them out? Or better, prevent their births?
2.Why not prevent the wars?
Once you start to change anything, you alter the course of history. The future as we know it will no longer exists.
The wars will be inevitable. And wherever it is you ship the Jews to, it is likely they will meet the same fate in the hands of another.

I think the approach of trickles over time will work. But when you start to make 'changes' then I don't think it will work out so well. 




 You have put a lot of thought into this, haven't you? Gold week deserved. 




 We are in agreement on this very point.
It should be that every one gets the proper training and directed guidance customized to them. And not in a one-sided manner. Education in a a broader sense. Basically equipping them whatever they need for a given type of work as well as for being a human being. This should include also intangible things. 




 Your argument is duly noted. 




 These are good and interesting points. I believe the disconnect here is in the idea that every one needs some type of instruction and training. Whatever you call the avenue, it is an institution of learning. 




 Let me get this straight: you think that somehow hiring someone with a Masters degree in computer science and paying for an h1b visa etc just to have them work for you is cheaper than hiring an American with equal qualifications. 
Also, when the owner of said company tells you that there is a shortage, it is nothing but obdurate obstinacy to insist that 'it', the shortage, is a myth. Where do you find your data to back up your claims that there is sufficient supply? Why do you think so many foreigners are lining up to go to school here if there isn't an abundance of demand or shortage of supply of those with their respective degrees?
But don't let any of what I say stop you from holding dearly to your opinion, after all, this is a free country... Right? 




 I find this disturbing. It 'sounds' funny' and 'amusing' but you may be in serious need of help. This sounds like a very toxic psychic state to be in. You should be blissful about the opportunity to continue your activities on this new day. 




 You're right, you are beneath his level. 




 My point exactly. Let's keep ignoring the 100s of thousands of educated people who built and maintain Microsoft. If which many had to be imported from India and China because people like this don't see a need to educate Americans.
So sad. 




 That's the problem with your reasoning. It is assuming that the gifted ones come from a background of privilege.
Do you see the demographics in graduate school? Hmm? You are looking at life from a1950s lens. You can not do anything in this world without at least a college education. And even if you did, you would need a week educated labor force to execute. The 'labor' you speak of, that is, the skilled manufacturing and similar work from the 50s are the programmers and engineers of today. 
Please stop this idea that education is not necessary. Why do you want to keep importing education from abroad and allowing your own people to wake away? 




 "...You'll learn things you never knew you never knew.." 




 This is one of the very reasons to which a government owes it's very existence. 




 Even if we didn't have the supervision problem. Uneducated people create a third world country. They also don't do things like build internet, smartphones, or Reddit...
I should know, I'm from one! 




 I was simply trying to map your words on data and experience and the brain to what we know about computers. 




 Have you tried mapping this idea to an actual computer? How does that framework hold up? Do the same conclusions hold? 




 Sounds like you have "all" the answers you need. 

Edit: your strong dissention is duly noted 




 It would solve nothing. Nothing will ever convince anyone of anything they do not already believe or not believe. 
Such evidence will be dismissed and the investigators' reputation called into question.

One likely scenario is scientists misunderstanding what they have found and forming a new religion and this new religion will promptly being rejected by all existing ones. And so the chain continues...
 




 Your cells are replaced daily. I think on average you are entirely 'replaced' every 1.5 years or so. I forget what the math is. 




 Think about having two bio-suits.
Actually, even simpler, think about your clothes. How many do you have? More than two, right? What exactly is going on with your other clothes when 'you' are not wearing them? They are simply lifeless no?
'You' give life to 'your' body. Without 'you', 'your' body is lifeless. It is dead. So perhaps having another suit made will simply result in it being in some kind of vegetative state or just cold and without life. Unless you can figure out a way to plug yourself into it, like changing clothes, then it is impossible to move from one body to another.
I think of this in a similar way to how it is when you sleep....
Actually, this may be the best way to explain it. Perhaps the one body will simply fall into a deep coma/sleep-like state while you occupy another. 
But really, i don't think this idea is possible. It is much more plausible to think of some way to propagate the body from one location to another. Perhaps we should focus on transporting a piece of stone first? 




 Then use it as a working hypothesis.
There are things constituent of matter, which we know 'hypothetically' to exist but are yet unable to measure, or detect simply because we do not have the instrument powerful enough to measure these things.
On a much more fundamental level, if something was not made up of matter, but something else. Some other substance, call it ethereal or typeB. We know from physics that it will be impossible to have any direct measurement or 'evidence' of said substance using material instruments or tools. You need the right tool fashioned for the right purpose. Otherwise it will be like trying to detect x-rays with a radio or water with a net.... 




 It's about moderation (in the absolute sense not after you have altered your taste buds). You can train yourself to be just as satisfied with less salt if you take the time to tapper down. Your tongue will become more sensitive and require less salt to get the same sensation. Just in the same way with sugar and all else.
 




 This is the problem with the idea that what is the real you is physical. This body along with the brain is just a bio-machine, wet-ware. Like an exoskeleton used by the actual you for an earth-life. You are plugged in during pregnancy, and disconnect once it is destroyed or no longer functional due to irreparable damage or wear and tear from aging.
It's really not so difficult to accept this is it? 




 100% efficiency solar cells.
Some integer-fraction-speed-of-light-travel transport device.
And, wait for it, quantum learning pod (ala Vulcan learning pod).

 I think you should be more worried about the salt/sodium additives in preserved food than actual table salt. 




 Is any body correcting for increase in movie ticket prices or inflation? 




 So, let me put it this way:
Reading any of what you've quoted, 'holy' or 'good' is about the last thing that can ever be likened to it. It reads more like gruesome, noisome, disgust, or vermin.
Nothing of what is written in any of these books even sounds holy or good. And we all know who the usual suspects are when things are turned on their head and start to stink: man. This sounds very much like man's idea not something 'good' or 'holy' 




 Is the "beast" the government, corporations or is it simply you and I as a depraved collective unit? Government - I don't have any brilliant ideas except collective action. Similar to what the 'patriots' in days of yore did.
Corporations - avoid products and services directly and indirectly. Again this requires collective action.

And so the only logical conclusion here is that all of these point back to us as a collective unit being the proverbial beast. 

This is me just thinking out loud... 




 Clearly. 




 Congress 14.0 beta. I wonder what new features come with it... 




 Or put your money where your mouth is and stop feeding the beast. Each day we read about corporate practices we don't like and still consume, directly or indirectly, and invest in the these same corporations. Why? 




 From such a small sample, you can't call it a study.. 




 Not if my upvote on your comment about upvoting it has anything to say about anything your comment has to say about it! 




 Sounds wonderful. I rejoice with you friend. Now, don't mess it up :) 




 Wow. Such a thing is very transient. Meaning she will outgrow such childish behavior sooner rather than later. If she was as great as you say, is have slowly helped her see how stupid her behavior was, and help her fix it. 




 Maybe we should ask the hormonal police officer that question.... 




 Yeah, there's a video of what actually happened and the woman in question was yelling racial profanity and instigated a verbal and physical assault. The age of one sided lies are over, we have video proof now. 




 I wish more of us would see life this way. What is the point of a life if it isn't to the service of others? What really is the point? Fleeting, trivialities that amount to nothing. 
























 Should have stuck out your hand and introduced yourself. You play it off until she asks if she knows you. At which point you just say you noticed her and remember someone calling her name the other day. 




 Truth! 




 TL;DR Alabama threads the letter of the law and bans gay marriage licences, not gay marriages. 




 Comcast is the ONLY ISP in Knoxville,TN.
My word! Why isn't the government providing internet connectivity hardware as infra, and having whatever private company provide the actual service? This lowers the cost of entry and eliminates this horrid monopoly.  




 Yes.  




 Are we to assume there were no animals alive way back when and are no longer in existence today that we just haven't found yet! I ask because urban assuming the myth stems from seeing fossil. 
Equally plausible is a low intellectual flight of fancy and embellished stories. 
So if a dragon is a misunderstood dinosaur or embellished actual creature gone extinct then we can strip out the frippery. Per the myths: flying dinosaur isn't mythical, we have other examples; fire breathing is perhaps a stretch; magical will be subjective since fire would have been magical to early men anyhow. So it appeared magical given what was comprehensible at the time. 
Per embellished fable, which I'm more inclined to accept: flying creature is reasonable since there are/were plenty of those; fire breathing is still a stretch but spitting toxic venom that burns as fire, or something of that nature is not impossible. We have electric eels, chameleons that change color and vipers that spit venom, these are actually more fantastic than spitting venom. Magical powers in the eyes of early men... 
Still, after we strip away the fellowship in both cases, you still have a creature like millions of others in existence or already extinct.  




 I can understand the stories about dragons being myth, but how does that make the idea of the animal itself a myth? Isn't that throwing the baby out with with the bath water?  



















 Excellent thoughts on the article. I'll state first of all that I do feel that fossil fuels have their value and use. But I'm not sure this is it. While it is not feasible to wean ourselves off fossil based raw materials (and there are innumerable implications), i do feel that there is always more than one way to skin a cat if you will. 
Ever single application or fabrication that requires fossil fuels can be sourced through one natural, sustainable means or the other. We either haven't found it yet, or we are leaning on the ease of what is readily available at the cost of the very planet we live in.
His, Mr. Gates's approach is one of accelerating the discovery or development of these alternative options, and my hats go off to him and everyone else putting even a penny into this research. 




 The refusal to use commas makes it so confusing to read.  




 'They' can't be greedy because technically, there is no 'they'. 




 Fracking is as clean as the air in China (no offense). There is nothing clean about consuming fossil fuels at the rate we are consuming. And as technology develops, we simply are unable to sustain it. The world is quivering right now and so far we only have people in the US and a few other developed countries to account for. What happens when all of Africa comes online? What about rural China? What happens when they too start to consume at the rate the average American does. See the reason for panic yet? 




 What do you mean 60-70 of 'THE people'? 




 I'm sorry, but when you take one statement and criticize it out of context, you kind of loose credibility.
Your response doesn't sound like you read or understood any of what I said. As evidenced from your very last sentence, which seems to capture exactly what I was trying to convey.... 




 Well, is have to kill you first. But then, the next guy would also require proof. And since you no longer have a physical body with which to communicate, you can't tell him otherwise.
For me it makes more sense since it explains much of the suffering that happens in the world. The way I see it, you have 3 choices:
1. Complete randomness. Which actually doesn't exist since everything has some mathematical it logical prices.
2. The Christian version of a God, who acts arbitrarily. See ops post.
3. Or some well defined laws that govern everything. Including the cycle of human existence which includes birth, death, and rebirth. Having to pay for every single act that you put out. 




 A note to all of you:
Understand the concept of reincarnation and reciprocal action. What you sow you MUST reap.
I read here, questions about how you can reconcile forgiveness, acts such as the Nazi holocaust, and someone  suffering from cancer.
Here is a plot twist for the ages: what if it was Hitler or his kin who is now in this present life suffering from cancer. 

And the idea that your sins just disappear because you profess some belief or other is illogical. The same book tells you that you must reap what you have sown. So the only way it makes sense is to understand that even after you repent, you will receive forgiveness after you have made good every single act of wickedness. That is true Justice! And only after having made good your wrongs and keeping with your promise to turn a new leaf, naturally, you are forgiven as if nothing ever happened. Because you have made right your wrong! 




 That's because it is all wrong. Simple answer. No such nonsense took place. 




 Your opinion is duly noted. 




 No, it's respect. You should try it. 




 Because, you know, since they lied about how they murdered him in cold blood, they couldn't possibly be lying about that. You only get one lie pet incident, right? 




 News flash, we needn't imagine such a scenario. We are living in it. 




 The only part I agree with us the part that your suggestions will never happen. You need a good people for that to happen. But if you had a good people, you wouldn't be in this mess in the first place. The system will inevitably collapse on itself. That much is for certain 




 Actually, this happens to every one. 




 Well I'd rather they fear us that the status quo 




 It's the problem with capitalism.
FTFY. 




 It is sad that we all don't see this as a collective problem. But your words remind me if something I read a while ago. 
Until we build our own networks and patronize them, we will never have a voice. And no, BET did not count. 









 Guys, this is important.
I'm not anti-capitalist or anything... who am I kidding: I am as anti-capitalist as they come. Why, because philosophically speaking, the most profitable enterprise is no different from slavery. If you strip away all the frippery, you are left with something very close to that.
It dictates that our actions are driven by what is most profitable. How can such a concept ever be good? Shouldn't we always do what is right and what serves the greater 'good'? This is what is best. And it is almost always in conflict with what is profitable.

Freeing ourselves from dependence on carbon and other fuels will usher in an immense upheaval in human life as we know it. Just imagine not having to depend on anything or anyone for energy. Then we can actually begin to do quite wonderful things. Think of it, near zero restrictions on energy supply...
 
 




 I feel like I gained weight and am at an increased risk for a heart attack for just watching that. 




 Did you read the article? We need to move away from fossil fuel. It is high time we dramatically increase our focus on research and ideas on renewable energy. You are reading it wrong. What you are interpreting this as is "just cut off the lights".
No! It reads "let us make the use of alternative renewables as our primary source of energy a number one priority and spare nothing in this effort."
The pope is not a scientist. When Kennedy said, let's go to the moon. I can hear your same attitude asking 'how does he suggest....'. He wasn't a scientist. He simply insisted we make it a number 1 priority. That really is all. 




 I'm not sure what your criteria is but this is about the response of Jeb bush, a us presidential candidate to the popes announcement. 
You really should read the article before make such decisions.  














 Where is the decency in this world. At this rate, there will soon be no reasons to wear any clothes at all. Then you'd hear lamentations about how that every guy you encounter only seems to have sex on his mind. ... Go figure. 




 What does it matter? You and I exist and are subject to the laws of nature whether we choose to believe them or not. So again, what does it matter what we believe or don't believe.
I don't believe in gravity. That will not stop me from plummeting to my death of I took a step off a ledge.
I believe I can fly... Same result.
What you say you believe is of little or no importance.
What actually is of value is recognizing the laws that govern the world we live in and adjusting our lives so that we fit into them. And this is actually to our own personal benefit. Otherwise, we will achieve the same result as in the previous examples above.
