 I can't imagine a worse possible team for a WR with "great raw skills, but a lot of learning and developing left to do." 




 I remember reading somewhere that square planned out IX, X and XI all at the same time. The idea was that IX was kindof a final tribute to the old days, X was like the "This is the direction Final fantasy is now heading in" and XI was their stab at the newly developing MMO market. Their goal was essentially to cover all the bases.

 I really doubt Cam Newton and (to a lesser extent) Andy Dalton are going to make huge jumps this year, just because they both played so well as rookies last year. But how about the other three quarterbacks drafted in the top-12?

Christian Ponder and Blaine Gabbert had miserably bad QB ratings, but they also were throwing to some of the worst receiving corps in the league, and behind some of the worst offensive lines. Jake Locker, obviously barely played at all. Do you think any of these guys will end up in the "pretty good" group of quarterbacks this year? 




 Yes yes yes yes yes to all of this, also:

 In another sub? Sure. But not in truereddit. That's kinda the reason this place exists. 




 24 upvotes? Glad to know this subreddit has gone completely to shit. 




 Looking for Legal Advice?
This subreddit is for discussing developments in the law and jurisprudence. While posts may OCCASIONALLY seek advice about law school or careers, this is not a forum for soliciting or giving legal advice. 




 To be fair, despite what most armchair critics will say, the tax code NEEDS to be as complex as it is (for the most part), because taxation is a complex subject. The florida criminal code? Not quite so much.

  How is a dog sniff not a search? Because there's no reasonable expectation of privacy under that circumstance? Just because society/the Supremes have determined that the fruit of that police action is admissible - regardless of the reason - its still a search.

I saw you say that you're a criminal defense attorney, and I'm just a 2L fresh out of crim pro, so I certainly give deference to your opinion, but...

When we're talking about 4th amendment jurisprudence, the question of what a "search" is for this specific body of law involves an intrusion by a state actor upon a reasonable expectation of privacy. For the aforementioned reasons, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy that is being intruded, thus it is not a search.

Something closer to your hearsay example would be something like a *hot pursuit* exception. In that case it IS a search, but it's still "reasonable" and thus constitutional, but it is a search regardless.  




 It really isn't. When you wiretap you are listening in on a phone call, if it's done in a telephone booth or a home, then the courts have long recognized that there is a privacy interest that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. Because it intrudes upon that interest, it is now a search.

It's not a matter of what they use to intrude, it's a matter of what they're intruding upon. A dog sniff intrudes upon NOTHING except the fact that there are or aren't drugs in a suitcase. Nothing else about the inside of that suitcase is revealed. Protecting drug possession is not a legitimate interest. Therefore, it is not a search. A wiretap intrudes upon every conversation made over the tapped phone. The intrusion is much much greater because they're intruding upon all conversations made from private places. The courts have never had issue with whether or not there was a reasonable expectation of privacy in making phone calls. 

You should actually read *Katz* and *Place* and the the distinction will seem much more clear. 




 No, that is wrong. Look at [Katz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katz_v._United_States) and its progeny, there are factors that go into whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. Your second sentence doesn't even make sense because we're not questioning whether the search is "legal," we're questioning whether or not there is a search at all. 

A person needs a legitimate interest to have a reasonable expectation of privacy. In less eloquent terms: not having all of your belongings rummaged through by policemen is a legitimate privacy interest. 

The only piece of your privacy a dog sniff invades is to the fact that you are carrying drugs or not. The privacy of everything else about that bag is not intruded upon in any way. Because there is no legitimate  interest in drugs, and because the "sniff" does not intrude into the privacy of your briefcase in any other way, then it is not a search.

 ITT: redditors don't understand taxes 




 The court has absolutely not done this. See [Ciraolo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_v._Ciraolo) where they confirmed flyovers where constitutional under the "plain view" doctrine on the theory that passengers flying overhead in a plane could see your backyard. There are a multiplicity of other examples where technology is permissible.  




 Tried posting in there. Got downvoted anyways :/ 




 I understand the trail you're going down, but I don't think it's the proper analysis to be asking. The standard enunciated in *Katz* is whether or not the privacy expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. 

Plain view has long held the standard of "no privacy expectation" because that a ridiculous limit on police powers (think; license plates, hair color etc.). This court hits a weird string with technology because now the police are gathering MOUNTAINS of data that, in pieces, would fall under the plain view exception. The policy the majority is pushing (That was originally stated, as dicta, in Kyllo) that the reasonable expectation is going to shrink as technology expands. But this feels like a stretch of the ruling Kyllo, because the logic isn't quite on point.

I really like this policy, but I don't like it as applied to GPS tracking devices, because this isn't question a question of a deeper intrusion into someone's privacy, but rather a much broader intrusion. And ultimately I don't think this summation of publicly discoverable information should rise to the reasonable expectation standard when taken as a whole.

Again, it's a minority opinion, and I definitely understand why most people disagree with me, but I don't think it's open and shut in either direction by any means. 




 No, the 4th amendment is a limit on the powers of government action, this has nothing to do with private citizens. 




 This is a constitutional limit placed on government powers... it's not like any agencies are just *exempt* from this. 




 I'll be in the deep minority here and kinda disagree with this one. 

Sotomayor notes that there is a privacy interest in the sum of ones public movements; which wouldn't be so if there was simply a tail on him for 28 days, and the Kyllo argument feels unconvincing because they're not gaining any insight (his location) through technology that isn't public at any given time (i.e. the infrared heat patterns of a home). It seems like a matter of police efficiency rather than a deeper invasion, and I just don't love the jurisprudence.

That said, having the court actually rule in favor of expanding the 4th amendment is a breath of fresh air, and I do like the policy they're keeping in mind with regards to technology and expanding police power in investigation, so I won't complain. 




 Okay.

 I'm a Christian and I'm studying tax law, so I may know a thing or two about tax exempt entities. These pastors are not acting in affiliation with their churches, but as private individuals with their own right to free speech. There are no legitimate grounds for revoking their exempt status. 




 There honestly is nothing even remotely true about that sentence.

 Maybe too late to be noticed but: debt incurred does not count against income, only interest accrued against you on the debt does. So worst case scenario if you're at 100k debt at 8% and none of it is subsidized you're looking at  -8k. 




 Wat. Dwight for the 10-11 season had *at least* a moderately more extensive set of offensive weapons to use. Did you not notice how his ppg went from 18.3 to 22.9 last year?

 What is that I don't even 




 Chicken sandwich, no pickles, +tomato, then manually apply one pack of chick fila sauce. Ask for an arnold palmer to drink. I worked there for 3 years and that was my favorite item.

Runner up meal: buy the tenders, ask for bbq and ranch, dip the tenders in both packets one at a time. Glorious.

One that was only open to employees: the maraschino cherries came in giant buckets and were in a cherry juice that was substantively grenadine. Chick fila goes heavy on the syrup for their soft drinks, so the soda fountain sprite + cherry juice made the best shirley temples I've ever had. 

Another thing I did (that isn't available to the public), was take the caramel packets that come with the catering fruit trays, and mix in a medium fruit cup thoroughly so it was like a candy soup. 

Okay, that was actually kindof gross. But it was awesome. 




  "When I was going to law school, and I sold my (Chevrolet) Corvair to make first-semester tuition and books for $330, a sizeable portion of the faculty had tenure."

 Meh, I feel like the only way we keep peace with r/atheism is to not give them anything to be mad about. In recent history this sub has turned a lot more to "poking fun," and I don't think it's inherently bad, but I'd rather keep the tension as low as possible.

 We've just about been "terrifyingly close [...] to complete totalitarian fascism" since the end of the reconstruction era.

The police force has been empirically much more professionalized ever since the Burger court's jurisprudence for criminal procedure and the Miranda warning waiver regime.

I'm really sorry about your friend, it's incredibly shitty what happened, but CowboyDan is right to point out that it's really not anything new in the broader sense of government power.

 Reddit, I'm reposting this from the John Paulson loophole thread because I missed the boat aready

I'm not going to comment on whether or not this type of loophole should be closed, but I think understanding the system a little better could be help put into perspective why he's only paying 15% in taxes:

There are generally two main ways for the government to tax. 1. As personal income- we all understand that there are marginal rates etc. 2. Through a corporate double taxation- this means that the corporation will be taxed on its net income. But remember, corporations are merely a collection of people, the stockholders. So AFTER the corporation is taxed once, the government puts a 15% tax on the distribution of that money to it's owners.

for instance, hypothetically if the corporate rate is 35% and the capitol gains rate is 15%, that means for every dollar a corporation earns only 1(1 - .35)(1 - .15), or 55 cents actually makes it to the owner, so people who make money through corporations would be effectively taxed at 45%

REMEMBER THOUGH, employees (you guys) salaries are deducted from pretax net income, so the money the corporation makes that ends up in your pockets will only be taxed once, at most for 35%.

SO, when a man like John Paulson makes his income, it comes out of the AFTER TAX Net Income of the company, because his earnings are benchmarked by the after tax profits of the corporation, not the PRETAX Net Income of the company like most employees.

It may seem like John Paulson is scamming the government out of money he should be paying in taxes because of a loophole. But remember that the money that he made has already been taxed once at the corporate rate, so the amount of money in taxes that he's paying on his income is NOT the total % that the government has taxed.

That is all.
 
























 Haters downvote. But PJIII will rise. 




 I love Barnes. But Curry, Thompson, and Lee are all solid scoring options already. I just can't see him having a big enough role to win ROY. 




 The bobcats have such a lack of scorers in place right now though. I could see him going 15/6/5 on 41% shooting and making a serious run at ROY. I think that'd be his best case scenario. 




 I think one pertinent detail people aren't mentioning: they're giving him a statue because Joe Pa has been the coach at Penn State for 45 years and has won more college football games than any coach in Division 1 history. The man is an absolute legend in his own right.  




 It's not. But it's not replacing commercial breaks, it's in addition to them. 




 It's really difficult to get an idea how good his game is going to translate to the NBA. 90% of those highlights were the result of hilariously bad defenses that he'll never see (unless he's playing Andre Blatche) here. He definitely has unquestionable athleticism, but I think he's going to have some growing pains while he starts to figure out how NBA centers work, and I expect him to have a *much* better 2nd half of his rookie season than first. 




 1. Yes

2. A company whose owner gives money to groups that take an anti-gay rights stance =/= corporate discrimination. 




 Crim pro is easily the most "that's some serious bullshit" class of the 22 I've taken so far. Some of the analysis the justices use is so far removed from reality it's hilarious. 




 Overall not a talented scorer by any stretch, extremely poor free throw shooter, passing skills prowess is inflated (via his assist numbers) because he plays with the big-3 as opposed to, say, Deron's situation in NJ last year.

I don't necessarily agree with those arguments. But those are usually what's brought up.

 The thing about law school: with a couple specific exceptions, nothing you learn is really that difficult. But the pure volume of material you learn, as well as the nature of law school exams make it incredibly rigorous and testing. So it's still hard, but it's not exactly going to ever stretch the bounds of your cognitive faculties. 




 Not really, no. Starting with the market crash in 2008, the legal hiring market didn't see a downturn; it saw a complete structural collapse.

 Egregious Texas trolling. We all know it's top-14. 




 It's funny that, as a Magic fan who has slowly given up on Dwight being a part of our team's future, i've had the exact opposite reaction progression. 




 What on God's green earth just happened? 




 And even then, I think the Wolves are the first team to replace anyone who falls out. And even if two teams fall out, suggesting Curry, Bogut, and Davis Lee are going to stay healthy is an extraordinary suspension of belief. 




 *In 1992*

1. Magic was already retired, and was becoming a serious defensive liability for the Lakers leading up to that point. Chris Paul today is probably the best defensive point guard in the NBA, and overall he's absolutely better than 1992 Magic

2. Scotty Pippen v. Kevin Durant  is impossible to say conclusively in either direction. Durant is plausibly the best pure scorer in the NBA right now, but Scotty Pippen was much better defensively.

3. Larry Bird's back was going out by '92, he was a significantly worse player that year than Westbrook was this year. 

4. I wouldn't call Stockton a better player than Deron; Stockton's legacy comes more from his insane durability and his incredible passing skills, but outside of that he was very one dimensional. Deron is a much better defender (read: average) and is a much more capable scorer as well.

Edit: after going back and looking at Stockton, I'm definitely wrong about him, so nevermind on point 4. 




 That doesn't even make any sense. 




 1. Ryan Anderson is not small... he has the same height/wingspan as Kevin Love.

2. His defensive rebound numbers were low because Dwight is a defensive rebound vacuum.

3. He had 3.7 offensive rebounds a game last year, 5th most in the entire NBA.

4. Why are you talking about Ibaka? They're very differently built players. 




 LOL at CP3 going back to the Hornets. 




 Ummm, you know the Heat *just* won the championship, right?

 A view that correlates with a party's base is not the same thing as an ideological tenet of the party. 




 Yep. Howard has had *no* character problems his first six years (unless you count "being too happy" a character problem). Every negative thing he's done has revolved around his crappy situation with the Orlando Magic management; and I don't entirely blame him, even though he could have handled it much much better. His actual locker room attitude is a non-issue.

 Hey. This guy is against America! Downvote him! 




 I would definitely make two part movie of final fantasy VII. The first one would end right after [game spoiler alert] Aerith's death. I'd probably have to cut out certain events, like most of the more minuscule parts of the journey through the midgar sectors, probably Yuffie/Wutai altogether, and the Cloudless hunts for the huge materia.

Peter Jackson would direct it, because the Lord Of The Rings style of epic is the only way this film could be pulled off. Jeremy Renner would be cast as cloud, Kristen Stewart would be Aerith, Chris Hemsworth as Sephiroth, Carey Mulligan as Tifa, Colin Farrell would be Vincent Valentine, Bryan Cranston as professor Hojo, Brendan Gleeson as the voice of Cait Sith (he's supposed to have an accent), John Hamm as the voice of Red XII, Terry Crews as Barret Wallace, and Bruce Willis as Cid Highwind.

The movie would definitely have 5-6 incredibly surreal Kubrickian long-shots, including the destruction of sector 7, the journey down the northern crater, the flashbacks to nibelhelm and Cloud/Tifa's descent into the lifestream.

This will never happen though :(

 Quick refresher in terms of beliefs: Presbyterians generally believe in reformed theology, which is largely based in [these five points](http://calvinistcorner.com/tulip), that were established above and beyond Luthor's theological break from Catholicism, whereas Methodists, whose theology comes from the reflections of John Wesley (who founded Methodism more as a way of life, trying to be "methodical" about living holy) rejected those views and embraced [Arminianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminianism) which is essentially an exact opposite stance all five points previously mentioned. That's how those two differ, anyways.

It's legit guys. 




 That's awesome. Was there a guide of some kind you used to get there? 




 It's not an exemption, just a separate taxable rate. 




 I live in Atlanta. Here it is not. 




 Ugh. This exact moment has prevented me from my lifelong goal of a lvl 1 Excalibur II walkthrough. I hate you (with adulation). 




 Yep. Florida is a great state. And I'd imagine that, controlled for socioeconomic factors, it's about as intelligent as most of the rest of the country (I hold reservations for the Northeast and the West). It's just a great target to knock on. 




 They don't think it be that bad. But it do. 




 Check your sidebar. 




 No, seriously, what the fuck reddit. You've been bitching nonstop since this site was creating about how our due process rights are eroding, how the death penalty is simply wrong (regardless of the level of doubt). And now that people are killing endangered animals instead of humans *you're completely okay with it.*

Shitty hypocrisy is shitty. 




 Prelaw doesn't qualify you for shit either. You need 3 years of law school after that before you're able to take the bar, and you can go to law school from any undergrad degree, so it's not comparable to premed.
 




   I really don't know where to turn to or what even to search.

Getting recommendations for a lawyer would be a great place to start 









 For me personally, I enjoyed the simplicity. I think a lot of times when videogames try and put a complex moral framework around a villain they often fail and it's usually a criticism of the game. FFVI didn't even try; they just went for pure, simple, evil. It's a breath of fresh air.

Not only is abnormal for a villain to be so straight-forwardly evil, but he actually succeeds too. He destroys the world of balance. Those two factors make for a very unique and wonderful villain. 




 What? I was attacking his vague use of "legal loopholes," not the numbers themselves.

He also said "over the past 10 years." So your graph is completely worthless, because the highest marginal rate has been at 35% for 10 years now. 




 The capital gains tax rate isn't a loophole. 




 Not really though. 




 8% geometric return is a complete fantasy land.  




 Just briefly looked up his post history. One of the most curious posting styles I've ever seen in my life. 




 Weird, I've been told i'm "stand offish" and "the guy who doesn't like anybody" 




 At stanford though? 




 Yep. Ignoring is the greatest weapon. 




  Now, as a white male, I feel as if I'm attacked by a black man, I can't defend myself as I'll get screwed legally even in the right.

Calling paranoid parrot. 




 Reading comprehension. We're talking about consistency amongst manuscripts; not the occurrence of the events themselves. 




 Wait... what??? Fair game???? Are you kidding me? 




  This admission that the NT is 0.05% wrong

That wasn't what was stated in the chart; it's claiming that we can only verify, through proper scientific means, as to 99.5% of it. Not that it's only 99.5% accurate. 




 Most of the time, if it's just the post-exam attitude, the person is look at a B. 




 FF9-  :( 




 I honestly wonder about that exchange in retrospect. If Beasly had stayed he couldn't *possibly* have been worse than miller was... right? 




 I don't think he did. 




 Probably just a joke, because it's impossible to have civil discourse over Ron Paul on reddit, generally speaking. 




 I stopped after that fucking eye on day 12, I have to study tonight, does somebody want to tell me if there are anymore creepy images? 




 written*

come on man! 




 IIRC they were 41-41 the year before Thibs/Boozer came. So yeah, I find that hard to call them "contenders." 




 To be fair, the bulls weren't a contending team when he was coaching them. 




 This isn't a logical fallacy of anecdotal evidence dude. When someone makes a claim "all people can float" you only need one data point of "nonfloater" to prove it wrong. 

If the statement was "most people can float" then that's a whole different story. 




 You can disagree, but there are absolutely people out there who simply cannot float, no matter how proper their floating technique is. I'm one of them. 




 per the sidebar: **this is not a forum for soliciting or giving legal advice.** 




 Yeah, because who is Nixon anyways?? 




 ...really? 




  Are you fucking serious? He said the legislation would legalize child pornography. This is as absurd as saying the forth amendment legalizes hiding evidence from cops.

lolwut? 




 That's so cute. 
























 Based on your "corporations are people" and "taxing the church" comment; I think you've got a bit of learning to do yourself before you start lashing out at other people. 




 I'm confused now. What else do German men wear? 




 Let's not forget second best rebounder. 




 Kevin Love *killed* amare and dirk last season, 




 Just enter two line-breaks instead of one to create a new line :) 




 1. **Annie Hall - Woody Allen - 1977**: The greatest comedy ever made, was masterfully composed by its nonlinear storytelling, and the disappointing and undramatic ending hit harder because it made the movie feel so much more grounded in reality despite its hyper-exaggerated quirkiness. Also, just plain goddamn hilarious.

2. **The Godfather parts I and II - Francis Ford Coppola - 1972, 74**: The greatest story ever told in American cinema. While the writing, acting, cinematography, are all near-perfect; the biggest mark is the elegance with which Michael Corleon's transformation is shown. No mafia film since has gone by without avoiding the shadow of this movie's legacy.

3. **North By Northwest - Hitchcock - 1959**: it feels like it was the precursor to the Bond films, but with Hitchcock quality direction. It is the both the essential action movie, and the essential mistaken identity movie.

4. **Barry Lyndon - Kubrick - 1975**: Almost every single scene takes on an otherworldly characteristic with the incredibly beautiful shots of the European countryside. 

5. **Once Upon A Time In The West - Sergio Leone - 1968**: This was the ultimate spaghetti western director at the height of his power. In my (unpopular) opinion, it has both a superior soundtrack and a more mature story than The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.

6. **There Will Be Blood - P.T. Anderson - 2007**: a performance for the ages by DDL, masterful direction by Anderson, ripe with symbolism and analytically dense. It's a modern day wet dream for movie lovers.

7. **2001: A Space Odyssey - Kubrick - 1968**: I could talk about this movie for hours. It has so many thematic layers hidden behind an extraordinary depiction of space and a brilliantly anthropomorphized robot antagonist. 

8. **Apocalypse Now - Coppola - 1979**: One of the most deep and fascinating explorations of human psychology through the medium of a war, conveyed through an Odyssey-esque journey.

9. **Lawrence Of Arabia - David Lean - 1962**: This is the definitive hollywood epic. The grandiosity is complemented by such a stark contrast in the humane and relatable personal struggle. This is what a 'blockbuster' should be.

10. **Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? - Mike Nichols - 1966**: there's something sharp and gripping and poignant about the dialogue in this movie. It rips into your soul and surfaces again for air over and over again for 2 hours.

And I really, really, really wanted to put Fargo, Manhattan, It happened one night, and the LOTR trilogy. Ten just isn't enough :( 




 Fuck my life. 

Even if Orlando was going for full on tank-and-rebuild; we could have and should have done a hell of a lot better than Mo Harkless as our young talent acquisition; and we should have found a way to acquire better draft picks than 2017-lottery-protected first rounders. Orlando unequivocally loses huge, no matter which way you look at it. 

Our lineup going into this season looks something like Jameer-Affalo/Redick-Hedo-Big Baby-Gustavo Ayon; with Vucavic, Harkless, Nicholson, and whatever point guard we sign coming off the bench. It's going to be a depressing stretch of 18-28 win seasons for the magic going forward. 




 You are everything that's wrong with America. 




 I'm actually mad at the absurd lack of young talent we're getting for dwight. I really wanted the Rockets to be involved in this trade :/ 




 ...That's not really how cancer works though. 




 Ha ha. You are so inflammatory and masterful with your trolling. It must feel really great. 




 Kareem would like a word with your word with johnydoom. 




 Holy hell. Australia played them tough as nails for 34 minutes and then **BAM!** 




 Is there a box score of this game somewhere that doesn't suck like NBC's? 




 Some very dubious calls going in America's favor -_- 




 I guess the olympic spirit got the best of him. 




 If we're not at our best, it's going to be even worse for you guys when you lose to us :p 




 Greg Reid, now this... *COME ON*

I have this heartbreaking feeling we're going to anomalously be ravaged by injuries/off the field issues for the second season in a row, finish something like 10-3, be ranked in the high-teens, and considered a huge disappointment again.




Okay. So that's probably a bit panicky. I'm just ready for the season to start.  




 I just thought it was a funny general example, because Florida might be the most apocalyptic legal market in the nation right now. 11 law schools + none of them having much/any interstate reach = *nobody* who goes to law school in Florida is reasonable safe the way a lot of "good regional placement" state schools are. 




 You haven't seen Florida's employment stats I'm guessing. The best way to get a job in Florida is to go to a really high ranked school and have contacts and connections in Florida. 




 And be honest. 




 Wait. Which continent are you talking about? 




 Loving the troll flair. 




 That article was awful. 




 It seems like the genuine coolness of the TED empire started declining almost completely in sync with its widespread growth in popularity. It's sad to see TEDx talks that are sometimes legitimately awful; and it's now even more sad to see, as the author put it 'that TED is no longer a responsible curator of ideas worth spreading."' 




 Tax. Not even a competition. 




 Some combination of 

1. Something you're interested in doing, given the very high likelihood of deciding not to go to law school

2. Something that will allow you to maintain the highest gpa possible. Think 3.9-4.0

Depending on your interests, you might be forced to pick one of the two. But if you want to go to law school, having an absurdly high GPA is *enormously* helpful. 

 




 Nope. There's only one way in which "tiers" is used when talking about a law school, and that's in reference to its national ranking. And John Marshall is a tier-4, for what it's worth. 




 tl;dr- if people *tried* harder to get jobs, then more jobs will magically appear. 




 Let A connote "eating a butterfinger" and B represent "you are thirsty." the first part of the statement is simplified to "if A, then B" and the only other logical statement we can create from that is the contrapositive "If not B, then not A" which would expand to "If you are not thirsty, then you did not eat a butterfinger."

So your friend's statement rephased: "if B, then A" does not logically follow from "If A, then B"; is sound logic and he should be congratulated. 




 "Hitherto there has been no thought I have been afraid of; if I should run across such a thought, I hope that I have at least the sincerity to say, 'I am afraid of this thought, it stirs up something else in me, and therefore I will not think it.' If in this I do wrong, the punishment will not fail to follow." 

(Kierkegaard)
 




 Wait.... really? 




 Why are there SO MANY FOULS this game?? 




 The Nigerian defense was so painfully bad... they would have had to start rigging their own shots to miss if they had wanted their fg% to drop below 50%. 




 This title/message is so confusing. WHICH ONE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO RESPOND TO? 




 Some of my favorites right now: Barry Lyndon, Lawrence of Arabia, Once Upon A Time In The West, North by Northwest, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Apocalypse Now. 

I know what you mean about just doing it to check items off a list, I definitely think there are a handful of films I just watched and moved on from, and are probably already due for a rewatching. But I think having that list there was the best way to just start plunging into cinema from scratch. 









 Aw man, I love the Yuffie sidequest. 




 that scene bugged me, because every time his ex did something to get hotter her hotness axis didn't increase, her crazy axis decreased. 




 At first I thought the author was just saying "you should find more tactful and creative ways of saying these things." But some of his commentary is just really poor and wrong (see: 2, 7). For 4 and 5 he's just contradicting himself by saying that you *should* say them, but don't do it right away. Well, duh.  




 I can understand that. But I think the point is for the rest of the congregation to know to reach out to them. I was visiting a church that did this; and several people came up to talk to me and help get acquainted. It was nice. 




  If he had any decent offensive threats at the 4 and 5

You say that like Carlos Boozer isn't a decent offensive threat? I mean, I understand why the Bulls hate him; but the demonizing is kindof hilarious sometimes. 




 **That's even worse** 




 He's come even farther since Angels in the Outfield. 




 Ew. 




 I've worked there. They don't.  




 If it's any consolation, I hate you on the inside as well. 




 Meh; I think that there are too many good power forwards in the west: Love, Dirk, Aldridge, the manimal, Blake Griffin, Demarcus Cousins, Pau.

Combined with the fact that Anderson went from being the Magic's second scoring option to now having to share the ball with The Brow, Austin Rivers, Eric Gordon, and company. I'd be legitimately shocked if Anderson makes an all-star team while in NO. 




 Eh. Most lists I've ever seen have Kareem above Bird. 




  Just try "hey, how are you" then. Ladies are often interested in the mysterious.

This is actually a terrible idea. Women almost never reply to thoughtless messages, because most of the time they just assume the guy is mass messaging, or under the rationale of "he didn't put in any time for me, so why should I for him?"

The key is to keep it a couple sentences long, ask conversation-starting questions about things she put on her profile, and don't sound stupid. 




 It also gives you a LOT less leeway if you're trying to differentiate between an A- (which is usually 90-92) and A (which is 93+). 




 RYAN ANDERSON COME ON PEOPLE. 




 Ryan Anderson has a much bright future already than Gallinari. 




 At least we still have ~~A great young PF in Ryan Anderson~~  
~~And awesome head coach~~  
~~A ton of cap space to work with~~  
~~Daniel Orton coming along nicely~~  
Hedo Turkoglu! 




 I'm actually pretty positive it was meant in jest, and people upvoting origibanality didn't quite get that, or are willfully ignoring it. 




 Lost in a world of condescending intellectualism through middle school, aficionado of the inner workings of their thought processes by 16. My guess is that now he's about to start his freshman year of college, and spent the summer rigorously outlining his magnum opus "the psychology of man." 




 *redoubles stalking efforts*
 




 Eh, that's not universal. I know a good handful of guys who ended up dating (and subsequently marrying) girls they were good friends with first. 




 Ummm no. The revenue of single stores can come close to 4 million dollars a year. That second number is completely wrong. 




 If by "large portion" you mean like .001% 




 Correct, it's served on a lightly toasted and lightly buttered hamburger bun with pickles. 




 But why make a list of something; and then put a player on that list for criteria completely unrelated to that list?

Not to mention, it's not even a safe assumption. To project he's going to have a better career than someone like Isiah Thomas or Allen Iverson is just *far* from being very likely. 




 How can someone realize that Malone was a 2x MVP, one of which was over '97 Michael Jordan? Not to mention he's second all-time behind Kareem in career points, enjoying one of the longest stretches of quality play *ever*, and still ranking him behind Kevin McHale?

We're talking an 11 time all-nba first teamer vs. 0 time all-nba any teamer.

This is frustrating. 




 This is a list that already has Kevin Durant at #25. I'm not putting much stock into it. 




 Why would your order a spicey chicken sandwich at the original one? They have HAMBURGERS AND FRIED OKRA there. 




 Chick fila's are very likely the most profitable franchises of all fast food in the southeast. A "decent" franchise can see 11k-12k in revenue on a good day. Choosing to franchise a chick fila could have very well been a financial decision, and there was probably no reason to expect boycotts in the near future. 




 Replace dinner table with middle school cafeteria.  




 I don't see too much of a problem with the military acting on a policy of "would be beneficial" rather than "need." Especially since the state of modern warfare is almost completely preventative.  




 No. But Chopin was bad ass. 




 We both share a birthday with Chopin and Justin Bieber. Yeah! 




 TIL I am dyslexic.  




 I feel bad for not knowing if you're being serious. Like maybe there's some paid bible study service somewhere that I've never heard of or something. 




 Rest assured, I am very afraid of how hard you are going to take it on me. 




 Building muscle in conjunction with some cardio, what football players do, is probably more healthy than distance running is. 




 Yep. Also, as a distance runner, the injury stockpile can be incredibly high (in the same realm as football) as well.  




 Yep, also football is so incredibly king in America, I don't think it'll come close to losing that status in the next 40-50 years. 




 wouldn't those be the same option though? 




 Yep. the word "kobe" on a menu means literally nothing about the meat. 




 I think he'll be a fantasy basketball steal this year. 




 Iwasjoking. 




 that's more statisticsy than sciencey; and you don't fuck with statistical validity. 




 Ugh, this subreddit is kindof a mess. 




 No way. Malone was absolutely better than Barkley. They had comparably good peaks, and Malone's absurd longevity gives him a huge edge. 




 Yep, Dwight is still significantly better offensively. 




 Better players =/= bigger roles *or* better stats. 




 I feel like citing to PER will get you mass-downvoted in r/nba. Especially if you mention rondo is ranked 21st among point guards in PER. 




 Make it 7' and I'm in. 




 Nah, most people could get a solid understanding of the relevant (to them) tax code by reading an hour a day for 2-3 months.

It's not like the only way to learn it is to read the freaking code itself either, there are supplements that break it down quite nicely for you. 




 Except recognition on investment income is, in most cases, easily deferred, so your second to last paragraph is pragmatically moot. 




 FWIW, accountants, lawyers, and bankers can all go up to 85-90 hours a week in the "big-4, biglaw, BBB" arena (not often, but not uncommon). 

Lawyers in that field *start* at 160k out of law school in big markets (NYC, DC, some Chicago firms), accountants start 60-90k but have a turtle climb to a much much higher ceiling. I don't know what the starting salary is for big-market banking, but they have by far the highest ceiling of all.  




 This is actually false! For tax purposes your income is only reduced by the amount that interest accrues on those loans. So technically you're making about -850ish a year. 




 teenage parenthood.  




 I've taken about 30 LSAT exams, and I can only remember that being the case once or twice. 




 That's nonsensical though. If you do something, you're still by definition trying to do it first, regardless of your level of confidence. 

When someone says "I'm not going to be able to pick up that rock," "I'll try to pick up that rock," and "I'm going to pick up that rock," they're still going to try to pick up that rock in all three scenarios. The middle one is just a neutral statement of fact without a predictive assertion.  




 You can have R v Dudley and Stephens... Enjoy it. 




 If you be the awesome SO I will definitely marry you.

Note: I will be a *slightly-above-average* SO. 




 Ugh. 




 IIRC there were eyewitness reports of the other team feeding him the ball at the end of the game to get to 100. 




 1. Yeah... that really diminished the coolness, knowing off the top of my head that one of these was definitively wrong.

2. 3 personal jurisdiction. 




 2. Can you cite a source then? Do you see how the second sentence doesn't logically validate the first?

5. If you're making an argument against the death penalty, it seems fair to have complaints that are narrowly tailored against the death penalty; and not broad problems with the entire justice system.

7. Spread out across the nation? That's really not much at all, and that amount would likely be doing nothing right now other than easing municipal and state budget crises to a very small degree. 

-still upvoted you though because discussion is good. 




 Magic had already been retired for a full year when he was on the Dream Team. Bird's back was going out and he was a year away from retiring as well. Either way, that shouldn't shock you for rebounds because  Charles Barkley was a considerably better rebounder than any of the three, which makes sense because he was a power forward and they were a shooting guard, point guard, and small forward respectively. 

Points/steals is still legitimately surprising, but not entirely when you consider that all-star teams tend to lead to historically wonky results; especially with such a high random chance of variation (from such a small set of games). Take for instance the [box score](http://www.usabasketball.com/misc/12_mnt_exh_05_box.pdf) of the latest game between USA and Spain. Carmelo led the team in points despite the fact that he was 6th in the league in [points-per-game](http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/scoring-per-game/sort/avgPoints/year/2012/seasontype/2) and all five players in front of him were also on the roster.  




 Your second point doesn't logically follow- It's very possible that it is a deterrent, and is preventing an even *higher* rate of murder. States could 

Your fifth point seems moot because that's true for minorities across just about all non-white collar crimes. So it will only naturally extend.

Your seventh point is just kind of silly because the number of executions multiplied by the difference in cost between a life sentence and a death penalty is negligible compared to just about any program that could create real societal change.  




 I think as a big man being drafted #1 overall, you're kindof inherently expected to be a good rebounder and at least a decent defender. 




 ehhhhh. I think you'd be stupid to say he doesn't even have an argument for top-10 all time, but I don't think he's "easily" top-10. For instance, you could very well make a convincing (or at least, a respectable) argument that 1. Jordan 2. Kareem 3. Wilt 4. Russell 5. Magic 6. Bird 7. Shaq 8. Tim Duncan 9. Oscar Robinson 10. Hakeem 11. Lebron James 12. Karl Malone are better than him on the all time list right now.

I do think he's a top-10 all time player, but you can't deny there's a certain subjectivity to it; and Kobe could definitely be excluded from that top 10 amongst the wiggle room. I could see him being anywhere from 7th to 13th. 




 Not as much, but that statistic about Bowden is wrong as presented. 




 Only in division 1 though. 




 Does that really count as an infographic? 
























 "not that bad" is still probably not going to win more than 20-23 games; which is actually really bad. 




 1. A hornbook could set you back another 150 bucks. Any sort of E E will set you back ~50. If he's including other things that weren't included (law in a flash- flash cards) that's another 40-50. 

2. New books here are around 180; I think 150 is an underestimate. Granted, I still think 9,000 is really stretching it. I'm probably spent 2500 as a 1L, 1500 as a 2L, and will spend about 800 as a 3L. If I had gotten every textbook + recommended hornbook + E E + some nutshell + law in a flash for all classes in which they were recommended, I think I could have broken 9k.

3. American books are much prettier than their Australian counterparts. 




 x_x sorry about this thread then. 









 For some reason, all the thrift stores I've been to here in my city are all extremely poor quality, I've lost faith in local thrift shopping. 




 laughs at you for using 'relevancy'

feels like an idiot after discovering relevancy is a word. 




 I'm looking to accumulate ~4 Fair Isle sweaters that are 'fashionably ridiculous' for this fall; but it's hard to track down a decent variety. Does anyone have any suggestions? Or any absurd ones they've recently come across? 




 I'm wondering this too. 




 Then we blow like... four. 




 I feel like dark shades of blue usually work best with light/medium grey. So a light grey v-neck sweater, nice blue jeans and some leather shoes. Or maybe a grey blazer with a white button down underneath. 




 Excellent. Thanks a ton. I found [these](http://www.florsheim.com/shop/style/18150-03.html) on florsheim, but they look too shiny. Is there any specific type of material I should be looking for in a shoe that is basically signifies it doesn't have a formal-shoe level of shine to it? 




 Inspiration is this- http://i.imgur.com/rh8IW.jpg

I've found these- http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/allen-edmonds-clifton-oxford/2892042?origin=category contextualcategoryid=0 fashionColor=WALNUT resultback=0 but on a student living budget, it's *really* difficult to justify the price. Does anyone know where I can find something very close in looks for around 150-200? Or maybe know of a good place to buy used Allen Edmonds?

I especially enjoy the walnut color and the simplicity of the toe. Unlike the 'strand' oxfords. 




 I think it was the "streets of new york" part that made everyone think he was asking for it, rather than "what kind of shoes would work with this suit". 




 At least you *can* beat bad teams. 




 That's.. ummm... overaggressive, don't you think? 




 Medium. 




 Definitely extra slim. I'm 6'3 150 and extra slim is still a little baggy on me, but that's the skinniest they have. If you get a small it'll be about 1.5 inches too short on the sleeves. 




 6'3 150 checking in. Life is not fun. 




 Ours is pretty easy to justify-

1. We were going to have an awesome 2nd week game with West Virginia... then they bailed.
2. Florida, obviously our yearly rival game
3. USF was also *supposed* to be at least a decent-level FBS opponent
4. Murray State- every team is allowed 1 cupcake 




 Hey buddy, relax. If we're better than the three teams ahead of us, it'll show up as the season progresses. No need to pitch a fit about only being ranked 4th in the 4th week of the season. 




 Wait, what? Wake is 3-1 with a win over UNC, no less. Boston College is the 'lol' team of our division. 




 Errr, that sounds nice, but it's more just that those specific games were historically significant. For instance [the choke at doak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choke_at_Doak). 




 Depends on the occasion. For a business/professional/interview event, both of them are too informal and will look bad with a suit. For a less formal occasion; you might have some leeway, but you'd have to post pictures of the suit, and I get the feeling they probably won't.  




 Agree with you on the first paragraph. Still think it looks sophomoric and ugly on OP. 




 FSU returned a lot more starters than Clemson did though. 




 You're violating the spirit of the thread bro. 




 Or. Maybe he's just a dumb troll. 




 Typically when you join a society, there will be networking events with accountants there from all the firms (big 4, GT, BDO etc.) This is nice because building a repertoire with recruiters and accountants can only ever help you. 

At worst, you're going to have a better looking resume by joining a society, and by going to these events you'll get insights and advice that will make you a better interviewee. Ask them what they want in an intern/hire- then convey those traits back to them during your interview with the firm.

At best, your relationships will directly affect whether you get an interview or not; and you could even have already established a professional friendship with the guy who interviews you or one of your callback partners.

You *really* want, when your resume is being reviewed, to have the recruiter (or whoever) to look at your application and say "240drift is a sociable and easy to talk to person who asks intelligent questions and seems to enjoy this profession" instead of "I have no clue who this is, despite appearing on his campus multiple times, so we'll just have to screen him solely on the merits of this piece of paper." The odds of you getting an internship/callback/offer with the former is SIGNIFICANTLY higher than the latter, when you have a bare-bones resume and only your gpa working for you. Remember that your gpa is a part of your resume, not the whole thing. Why risk something as monumentally important as post-graduation employment by only having a partially good resume?

Would I really have THAT much trouble finding a good job after I graduate if all I have are my grades?

Think about it like if you were considering asking a girl to be your girlfriend, where GPA=looks. You have a certain threshold, and the more attractive she is than that threshold the more you want her. But you're going to be committed to a serious relationship, if she has absolutely no personality, no mental stability, and when making the choice to pursue her you don't know anything about her past and if she has any baggage, you'll probably want to stay away in spite of her good looks; afterall, you have your pick of girls, so you can take one that's not quite as cute but has a solid 9-5 job and you know is fun to be around. Just like an accounting firm- your gpa will make you attractive to them because you're probably above their threshold; but with *no* extracurriculars and no volunteer work working for you, and no idea who you are outside of this piece of paper you've sent in to be reviewed- they're going to be a lot more hesitant to consider you for this relationship, and probably settle for someone else.

I know the abstract idea of networking gets pounded into the heads of college students; and it's either scares them, or they decide in their infinite wisdom that it's not worth it. But in the world of job efficacy, this is the lowest hanging fruit out there.

tl;dr- Join your schools accounting society, put on a button down shirt, paste a smile on your face, and meet people. You'd be foolish not to, it makes a huge difference. 




 To be fair; the code of federal securities law is, in my opinion, considerably more difficult than the tax code. And the SEC administering is considerably less efficacious than the IRS. So when the general sentiment is that people hate the current code; I can understand strong feelings against sec. reg. 




 Ever heard of a dude named Steve Spurrier? 




 I'm 6'2 155 pounds, and almost all dress shirts I try on fit my frame but are too short in the torso and sleeves, or are long enough on the measurements but hang off of me like a parachute. 

I know BrooksBrothers has a decent extra-slim fit line, because my only three good dress shoots are from there. But I'm looking for some other lines of shirts that fit slim for the extra-lanky of us. I couldn't find anything in the sidebar or the (awful) search function.

Does anyone have any shirt lines that are good for us toothpicks?

Edit: and to go a step further, I'm especially looking for a light blue button down, but any general brand suggestions would be great. 




 You sound childish. 




 1) I only mentioned that because you said creaming 2 FCS schools doesn't tell you anything, you failed to mention we also creamed an FBS opponent that was 2-0, including a win against an ACC rival. Oregon, Oklahoma, West Virginia, all have considerably more shaky bodies of work right now.

2) I never said the transitive property doesn't exist. Good teams have bad games and lose by small margins to vastly inferior teams. VT got soundly worked, and clearly lost in the trenches to a team that, going into this game, had two pathetic losses. Having VT still ranked right now is just absurd. 




 How? between the 6 opponents of our two teams, Wake has been by far the strongest, and we just absolutely crushed; whereas oregon is giving up 24 points a game to Tennessee Tech, Arkansas State, and Fresno state.

And another: we've outscored Oregon so far this year too. 




 To be fair. FSU isn't the team spotting 34 points to FCS schools 




 How did you have FSU ranked 22nd preseason?? 




 1. Wake Forest could probably tell you a little bit

2. You failed to mention in there that they lost to a team that got whooped by Youngstown State. You have enough information to know that other teams have lost to much better quality opponents then freaking 1-2 pittsburgh.  




 Wat. We beat a conference opponent, a 2-0 conference opponent, who had another win against another conference opponent UNC. We beat them 52-0. We out-gained them in yardage 612 to 126. We held the 'quarterback of  week 2 in the ACC' to 8/22 for 82 passing yards. We held them to 1.2 yards per rush, and that includes a 34 yard run 2 minutes into the game.

52-0 dude. 




 I hate to leach off the main question- but I'm way too poor for the near future to afford boots like these. Does anyone know where I can find something that looks very similar but less? Or is this just the expected price to pay for a pair of boots.

Edit: I should clarify that I'm in love with that color scheme of the leather/soul/laces specifically; moreso than the exact shape of the boot. 




 Yep. Overall the suit looks very sloppy. I'll add that it's noticeably more tight around the stomach than it is where the vents are, making the whole lower half of the suit curve weird. 

Combined with the fact that it's a three button suit... eh, I wouldn't wear it. 




 FSU-UF

1. One of the best rivalries in the nation

2. Ee went through four humiliating years of getting trounced by them, and then once we got our act together they just completely lost their offense and we've trounced them right back. This year I think is the first time we get a really sweet game between the two teams in close to a decade.

3. The gators could plausibly be the last great stand preventing us from going to the NCG, which would exponentially increase the stakes of the game, and could make or break both of our seasons.

 This is exactly what I'm thinking too. Clemson's D doesn't look so great, I think FSU can put up a lot on them. But then Clemson has so many goddamn frightening offensive weapons, there's no way we're keeping the score low, nation's best defense or not. 

But now I feel like a homerdouche and a jinxer by picking my team to win by 24 over a top-ten ranked opponent, so I'm not sure.  




 I love you. 




 Those light brown shoes behind the row of cordovans. Can you tell me where you got those, and/or if they're online somewhere? 




 To be fair. FSU *hammered* an AQ team that's looking to be decent this season. 




 I will never for the life of me understand why that wasn't a complete pass. 




 I remember hearing that a lot about a year ago too :( 




 Right, everyone knows we're going to be playing Oklahoma; the key piece to our 2011 vengeance tour. 




 Living in Georgia now for two years; and frequent Alabama- Tallahassee is worse than both by a non-negligent amount. 




 No way. Yuffie has the best date scene, because it's so awkward between them.

Yuffie fo life. 




 Depends on what school you're at. 




 This is much much more truthful than the comment you were responding to, thank you. 




 So were the two clauses immediately preceding it.

*cough* spotting bowling green two legitimate touchdowns *cough* 




 It might just be the lighting, but those shoes look too shiny to match that outfit. Pre-distressed jeans look bad, go for a darker color. Shave. Overall not bad though. 




  T-shirts (and probably all upper wear) fitting is 95% in the shoulders.

Sadly, this varies. As a lanky 6'2 150 pound male, I'm constantly running into either a) having a shirt fit perfectly in the cut and the shoulders, only to find that it's way too short in the torso, often ending at the very top of the belt *or* b) having the shirt fit in the shoulders and be long enough, only to hang off my body like I'm wearing a camping tent. 




 I've actually been looking for a reasonably priced blazer like that for a while now... so if anyone has any suggestions, I'd be all ears. 




 Ponder isn't looking very accurate. Does not feel good man :/ 




 Holy hell they did it!!!! 




 Might want to switch to something harder soon. 




 My second favorite team this week! 




 A 6 minute mile is absolutely not even remotely difficult for a trained runner at the college or highschool level. Probably 75-80% of all track distance runners at the highschool level can break 12 for the 2 mile.

 Three in one game! His career is **over**. 




 Can you be a little bit more specific- what prep books did you use for which sections? Were they sufficient? Where were they lacking? 




 I'm in grad school and I'd like to get my CPA for a tertiary purpose, and I qualify to sit for my state's exam. I'm a very proficient self-studier, but I'm on a student's budget which means that I can't afford Becker's full review course. Ever something like Yaeger which is $1800 is a huge financial strain to me.
I saw that Wiley's review is absurdly cheap (150 for the whole thing), but given the price, I'm extremely skeptical of its quality as a good comprehensive review course.
Do you think it's reasonably doable, given that I put in the necessary time, to pass the four sections with this book alone? If not, would anybody want to recommend some of the next-cheapest alternatives? Thanks in advance for your help. 




 I'm in law school-

1. Corporate law, or any transaction field of law is very difficult to get into with the way the legal market is right now. I'd say over 50+% of all 3rd year students are struggling to find *anything* at graduation, must less a job in a transaction field. This is exacerbated for areas like corporate because the majority of corporate legal work is done at "biglaw" firms, which are the highest paying and most prestigious places to go after law school. 

2. Because of that, and because of the esoteric highering model of biglaw firms going after the best schools, while shunning lower ranked schools (see [here](http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202483173162 LAW_SCHOOLS_REPORT) for a ranking of the top-50 schools by biglaw hiring rate), I would argue that you'd be wasting an enormous amount of time and money by going to law school unless you attend one near the top.

3. Fortunately or unfortunately, law school admissions is very very heavily dependent on your "numbers" (that is, your GPA and your LSAT score). See for instance- http://gulc.lawschoolnumbers.com/stats. The graphs will give you an idea first of how closely correlated numbers are with admissions, and second what kind of stats you'll need to be competitive at the harder schools. You can also start seeing things like how Northwestern loves a high LSAT + work experience while UVA loves gpa.

4. My advice would be to talk to people in the profession about what the profession is like; get general knowledge and try and educate yourself as to whether or not you want to be a corporate lawyer. If you decide you do, take the LSAT, and study for it like *crazy*. The LSAT is a very learnable test, and spending tons of time working through the [powerscore bibles](http://www.amazon.com/PowerScore-LSAT-Logic-Games-Bible/dp/0980178207) (which, unlike what you'll find with the CPA, is actually the universal consensus credited study guide) and taking 25-30 practice tests (they publish actual old exams for pretty cheap) you can go from being awful to doing quite well. Granted, this alone is going to take 2-3 hours of study a day for about 4 months; but you'd be a fool not to put in the time because a single LSAT point can be the difference between admission and waitlist/rejection from the school you want to get into.

All in all, it's a long and arduous journey, so best of luck to you. 




 As someone who's generally very shy and introverted; this is a huge fear of mine. Would love to hear feedback. 




 Hell, I'd take Jameer Nelson, Jose Calderon, Lin, Jennings, Jarrett Jack, Rodney Stucky, Tyreke Evans, Darron Collison, Dragic, and Kemba Walker over Chalmers too. 




 I would disagree with your disagreement of yourself. You gave some specific examples of some of the types of problems that pervade poor and minority ethnicities in America.

I think it's just important for people to understand that, while obviously this is not true for everyone within any disadvantaged ethnicity, and while people definitely are able to overcome those disadvantages, there should be *nothing* controversial about suggesting that when you have these debilitating factors occurring at a much higher rate, you're going to have issues like crime, STD transmission, and poverty rising at a higher rate.

It's also important for people to not ignore or be ignorant to the lack of culture that we established, and the intensity of the systematic discrimination for black people specifically that disallowed them to just "overcome" these disadvantages like other ethnicities have (asian populations in california etc.) 




 False. The Beatles were considerably more influential. 




 This for some reason makes me think of two guys work in finance. One tells the other to "run to biglaw." As though either are a reasonably easily achievable option for someone to just run to. 




 Not to mentioned, that idea is only about about 6 minutes worth of show. 




 I'm not annoyed by them, it's just an 'aww that's cute' sentiment. I still remember [making memes](http://i.imgur.com/5ddfY.jpg) as a 1L. 




 1. How are you going to do this when the professor assigns "pages 43-87" in the reading? 




 Here come the 1L memes. 




 ESPN's Sports Science is one of the more stupid things that has ever existed. 




 Yep, pushes the movie to be being too long in length, and the french plantation just doesn't fit with the rest of movie. I'm glad it was left out. 




 I agree, and I upvoted for that excellent response. I was just merely explaining his PER. 




 Sounds like a British person came up with that quote to make us think they did anything.  




A^M^E^RICA!!!!!!

Edit: Joke people. I was joking. I know British intelligence played a huge part in WWII 




 Affalo may score close to 20ppg, just because the Magic are starving for a scoring option. But to be masochistic about this season- he still had a below average PER, and taken in concert with the fact that when he was on the floor last year the Nuggets allowed 106.11 points per 100 possessions, and when he was on the bench they allowed 103.6; which makes me think he's not that great of a defender in spite of his reputation.

Aside from that, I think the Bobcats are hard to say because nobody has any clue how good of a player MKG is going to be next year, we have no bearing on him in the NBA. The Sun's Gortat is probably the single most underrated center in the league; he fits the position of a classic big man extremely well in decent blocking, great rebounding, and a very respectable set of post moves. I think he's one of the top-5 centers in the league.

So I think the Magic have a good chance of winning this competition. 




 I'd put Jefferson and Monroe above both Hibbert and Lopez. 




 First let me say that I love Rondo, and he's much much better than his PER; but it goes deeper than just him being a distributing PG. I'm going to focus on the negative aspects of his game, but I'll say up front that I love him and still think he's one of the 3-4 best pg's in the league regardless.

So. Rondo has a low shooting rate, sure, but that's for two good reasons. The first is that he's always had great scoring options around him, the big 3. That's a definite reason his PER is lower but is not a detriment to his ability as a player.

The second, and very damning reason, is that he's not a good scorer.  His true shooting percentage is *terrible* for a point guard. Rondo has the lowest TS% percentage of all 30 point guards who are above the league average (15) in PER. Amongst those 30, and excluding John Lucas who played less than 15mpg, the next lowest is John Wall who is still a considerable .019 above him. And the fourth worst of those 30, Tyreke Evans, shot  .029 above him, which is quite a wide chasm.

His fg%, while not awful, is still below average, and that's taking into account the fact that he can't stretch the floor with threes, and his mid-range game is still very weak. It's even less pretty considering how little comparative defensive attention he gets because, as mentioned above, he has such a wealth of scoring options around him. If he were to carry a greater offensive onus for his team, it would probably be even lower. Even worse than that, his free throw shooting is *horrendous*. Below 60% last season. That ranks him 116th out of 119 players last season who shot enough free throws for a statistically qualifying sample. The next lowest point guard, Devin Harris, shot 15% better than him from the line.

His inability to score hurts triply so 1. Because coaches will smartly not put him in an offensive scheme to be used as a scoring option, because he's so inefficient 2. TS% is directly taken into account for PER 3. scoring is the strongest way to affect your PER.

So while Rondo is the perfect example of the ways in which PER can be "broken", the reasons his PER are low do represent legitimate and serious shortcomings to him as a player. I think the general sentiment is that they are way overblown as a numerical representation of his shortcomings, and I tend to agree with that. 




  talk to a lawyer

There it is. 




 and rebounds, which I don't think many people quantify as an offensive statistic. 




 Aaaaaand his posts are gone. 




 Could be worse. 




 When do the results come out? 




 Yep. Our franchise doesn't suck at all. Even during that down period after shaq in the early 2000's we could have very easily established an awesome team with Tmac, Grant Hill, Horace Grant, Darrell Armstrong, and an emerging Mike Miller. But injuries ravaged us.

Also franchises that suck don't go on 4 year stretches of averaging 55.5 wins a season. 




 We made the finals a little while ago :(. Not bad for a city with like 12 people in it. 




 Orlando- 3rd richest owner in the league. Proven to be willing to spend that money for his team.

**WE WILL NOT STAY DOWN LONG** 




 That just about exactly how Magic fans felt about Dwight back in '08 




 FBI jobs requiring a JD are hyper competitive. FBI jobs not requiring a JD render law school worthless. 




 I'd like to see it tried. But this sub might be too immature; and the nature of basketball- that it inherently creates more argument- might mean they all turn into shitshows. I can see really posts getting downvotes by team homers, simply because the post is trying to show both sides of the coin.

Also, I think the format should be a little different. Unlike the more random nature of football, it's usually pretty easy to narrow down who the 4-5 contenders are at the beginning of the year and almost always be right. 




 Awwwww Yissssss

Just kidding though. It always sucks to see players decommit. 




 I think a great way to start researching would be [here, on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org) 




 "Hey reddit, do this thing for me"

 Why are you posting this here? This has nothing to do with being reformed? Why are you posting this anywhere? I'm sure a quick google search would lead you to YEC websites that attempt to give explanations. 

You are most definitely looking to pick a fight.

 I once said CP3 was definitely better than Rondo and ended up at -4. This sub is weird like that. 




 Oh look. Spain with their prissy little acting schtick again. Adding so much to this game. 




 The foul-call rate is too damn high. 




 Ibaka playing? Did Spain's head coach read the Bill Simmons article yesterday? 




 JESSE EISENBERG SIGHTING 




 Sure it can. Lou Williams was a hell of a lot more efficient at scoring and getting to the line than Nick Young is; that's still a downgrade.
