 That is amazingly wonderful. In highschool I never had a boy friend and going to dances was always a thing us friends did in a huge group!!! GGG 




 This reminded me of my boyfriend, 9 years Army. The love of my life, lost. We will meet once again my love. 




 If you're worried about anything supernatural, I suggest having a couple cameras set up around the room. And watch carefully and thoroughly. 




 Would be mine too. 




 Lol fuck that, normally not one toget into this argument but IPhone is ass and yes, I am using one/own one. Worst phone I've ever owned. Dot cars for apple products in general was given to me. You don't just stop being blind because of apple lol 


P.S- extremelyintoxicated right now will regret this later 




 Congrats! Big step for him. But do not take his showing of no interest personally ever. Although it may be hard to deal with sometimes he will get there eventually. Each child goes at their own pace.


But again congrats! 




 Not an unpopular opinion. As a waitress/smoker and restaurantuer I cannot stand when people bring their children into our restaurant. 




 Beyond handsome. 




 Dope shirt in the bottom picture, how did you stumble into that?  




 I'm a bartender at two restaurants and nothing kills me more than this gluten free fad. I understand some people really cannot have gluten but the ones that can.....

My new response to people that ask what on our menu is gluten free I now tell them 'Sir/ma'am, anything that had a face.' 




 Whack 




 Microwave your spoon and catch your house on fire orrrrrrrr stick the spoon in hot water and not be a dumbass. 




 Because I had the luxury of being able to go on spring break and to play sports, granted I bought my first car and am still driving it to this day, but my parents had money when I was his age. My parents at this point both have jobs but at their age it's so difficult to find something like he had before making that amount of money. I wanted to help, I want my siblings to have a somewhat 'normal' life like I did. That's why I do what I do. It was my choice. I couldn't stand to see my family suffer anymore. 




 Without even trying 




 Amazing! 




 I grew up with those trees all down my street, I always thought they smelled like cod. 




 They typically form from ingrown hairs. 




 WTF SAME! Sylvania!  




 It is a cyst. I'm not an esthetician or anything but have gone numerous times to get those removed, I stopped going because I love popping things so I do it myself. I pierce the skin with a sewing needle after sanitizing it and it has to go through the layer of skin and the sack the cyst is in. It will hurt. Then squeeze. The process is a little painful and if your not grossed out easily I suggest you do it yourself. Sometimes they just explode when you least expect if so I do it myself so it doesn't happen at the wrong time. Hope that helped a little.  




 Fello oHIGHo tokerr, hence my user name. Wish we could blow down, that would make me one happy girl!  




 That's how you should be.  









 LOL 




 Calle Ciega is the name of the band.  




 Yes, I was in Venezuela visiting family and this guy had taken real interest in me. My cousin was freaking out, so excited that this guy was talking to me. Surprisingly he was very fluent in English and that made me really happy. We danced on the beach, had dinner and an amazing time. One thing led to another and we ended up sleeping with each other. The next day my cousin told me who he was. Turns out he was in what we here would call a 'boy band.' South Americas Backstreet Boys. Even though I didn't know it at the time afterwards I felt an odd sense of accomplishment. Like "I just did a celebrity." Never saw him again, but did download his album off iTunes.  





























 Will post my picture soon!  




 Any chance this came from someone in northwest ohio? I swear I saw this on a girls facebook page a few weeks ago.... 




 Melatonin should do the trick, it works for me every time. Good luck- hope you find the remedy right for you. Cheers 




 That's okay then it will be all juicy and fun! I canny wait to see, thanks for sharing.  




 You go girl!  




 Passing my blunt to you. TOKE ON!  




 Ask someone to get it with a bobby pin or a comedone extractor.  




 Dem blackheads.... 




 As an avid cocaine lover I want to lick that off of her then eat her pussy. She's not bad looking at all. 




 Congrats handsome! We all deserve happiness- even if it only lasts a moment. 




 Try  /r/beards !!

But I do love it!  




 Looooool hahahaha LOL  




 Heaven! Simply beautiful. 




 Yessssssssss! 




 When I was younger and played a lot of sports I had horrible acne on my back in the outline of my sports bra. One day I was trying to get rid of some of the acne and came upon this really massive bump under my skin. So I started to squeeze and squeeze, it hurt so bad. I called my mom into the bathroom and told her to get it out. Once it was fully out it was the hardest most odd looking thing just like that! It was the size of your standard pill capsul. I dropped it on the floor and it made a clinking sound. I'm assuming it was a really old blackhead built up from over the years!  




 LOLOLOLOLOLLOL 




 That's appalling. 

Good luck resting in Peace you selfish asshole. 




 Its fake. And call me crazy but it looks like an image of Jesus in that round white thing when you zoom in, but I'm really stoned so that could be it. 




 I could do that! Lol 




 Perfect! I love getting ride of them!  




 I didn't 'force' him to do anything, he asked me to do it and then complained the whole time.  




 He wouldn't let me take an after picture, he was squirming the whole time and threw away the napkin! We didn't get a long hence the ex boyfriend part! Haha 




 I got them out with an extractor. And if you do not have one, the loop part of a bobby-pin works just as well!  









 I wanna get that  




 OHIO! 
























 /r/popping  




 That's happened to me a few times, I have worked at the same Country Club for 6 years. Each time they get closer to me.  




 Wtf did I just read?  




 Left over blow- duh... 




 Hello neighbor!  




 Toledo, Ohio.  




 I want to have really intense, mind blowin sex in there then take pictures of the handprints. 

Is that weird?  




 You. Your man-bun. Your beard. 

Ever close to Ohio, let me know.  




 Your mike has a blackhead. Lol that's what I see atleast 




 If only.... 




 Quite clever  




 Idk that nipple tho.... 




 For this, I would have also. I'm losing my mind. 




 Pull be pregnant in a couple months.  




 Post this to /r/popping and take a look at some of the other Plantar Warts on there!  




 I think it's strangely hot. 




 Hairy bum. 




 Maybe that's why Gary meows in Spongbob 




 Cyst* and share this on /r/popping they would enjoy it.  




 I cannot find it, I dug for it.. 









 Thank you for delivering OP!  




 I've always used a bobby pin or an extractor. It helps to have someone help you with the ones in your ears. SOMEONE WITH A STEADY HAND. You DO NOT want someone to slip and rupture anything inside your ear. 

Happy popping!  




 I would love to see a picture of the bathroom. 

I'm a medium. I have spoken to the deceased for years, starting when I was about 6-7. (21/f) Not only that I'm an active member at our local paranormal group. People have brought me into their homes to try to figure out what was going on. 

You need to research the property, and surrounding areas land. You need to be sure that no one in the home has brought home any new items. 

Please be aware that even though you told this entity to leave does not mean it will not return. (I am not trying to scare you.) 

We like to say that sometimes spirits will go dormant. They do also cycle. Haunt at specific times of the year, things like that.

Please post pictures, I would love to see the dog also. 

Best of luck to you, and remember- we are never alone. We chose to see what we allow ourselves to.  




 I don't think that is harsh at all...any crime against a child is haneous.  




 Let's find these girls and slap them, too many people I know have does from Molly. She is not your friend. 
























 Dabbbbbbbbbed 




 Hell yeah I will! I need a large cover up here soon, will stop in on a day off!  




 Dear brother, 27 years you will never get back. No matter the amount of money you will receive for this it can never make up for the things you wanted and hoped for.  I feel for you and I hurt for you. May you be free to do as you please. 27 years you stared at those gray walls hoping things weren't the way they were. I am honored you are a part of this community again and I hope justice is brought to those who it is bestowed upon. 

Love from Toledo 




 Cheers from Sylvania! 




 Having an alcoholic father and being an alcoholic myself, please do not stop this journey. I found my father for dead after a long day of us both binge drinking (not together) and was so messed up I couldn't save him myself. I hope the best for you and your journey. I wish my father could watch me go through mine.  




 Wait- do you have an extra tooth?  




 Gummo!!!!! Wtffff  




 TaTU 




 Danielle? Doug? Greg?  




 The pimple does not do the mustache any justice... 




 I love you sir.  




 Handsome!  




 A dream of mine.  




 Confradulations Johnathan! You are an amazing being. Keep up the good work and always remember there are people out there you don't even know who admire you!!  




 /r/popping plz we would love this there  




 She had her "Dead girls Don't cry" tattoo then and a few others, smaller breasts, added a lot when she got into the film industry. I'm from Toledo so it was an easy drive.  




 She's one of my favorites. When she used to strip in Dayton friends and I would go see her.  




 The only porn star that has absolutely flawless skin is Bonnie Rotten. Plus she's stunning without makeup which is hard to find these days in the adult film industry.  




 My eyes 




 You poor thing.  




 First off I agree with the people that are saying it's the eyebrows. That's a big part of it. Also, the woman is AGING. We all get older and all age differently. She hasn't been using fillers either...leave the woman alone. We have other issues in the world to worry about other than her appearance. Priorities people.  




 Damn Catholics. 




 You are beautiful! 




 As a graphic design artist you can clearly tell this is photoshopped. Better luck next time!  




 Ypuuuu first set are gorgeous. 




 This melts my heart.
