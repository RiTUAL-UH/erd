 It's things like this that make me wish I'd not gone into bioengineering but rather something that involves space. 




 What about bodily waste? I assume they're minimizing that with TPN, but that has to be addressed. 




 I was really expecting that lake to be frozen and them skid across it, somehow magically upright 




 The Little Mouse, the Red Ripe Strawberry, and the Big Hungry Bear.

My brother had my parents read it so much he memorized it and then "read" it to me.  He's only 3 years older. 




 Even without owning it, can't purchase... :(

 My girlfriend wants me to wear a batman onesie in the winter to keep warm, is very emotionally stable, plays video games (the first thing she did when she got to work was tell me what the free Xbox game is this weekend) and drinks with me at kickball every week.  She's the best 




 Having a good friend who spent a year trying to find a job after getting a BS in Ag   Biosystems and then an MS in BME, probably not, go for the full PhD.  However, the BME program at my school has a habit of kicking out PhD students who are "under qualified," "problematic," or that they "just don't like" making the MS degree relatively worthless here.

On the bright side, my friend is now studying for a PhD with full funding in Barcelona, Spain.  

The best advice either of us would give you is to not do something too specific.  Do not pigeonhole yourself into a technique that is so specialized and useful in only one way that you're a grain of salt in a pile of sand looking for the other grain of salt. 




 can we call this one "pornographic Penny?" 




 I only wish I knew more people in person that understood this reference 




 Here's a copy of the article:

 Guess I'm watching Scarface for the first time ever tonight 




 They should use this book instead of the sex-ed course materials.  Students would learn something.  If not about sex, then about the world around them as an engineer sees it.

Though the students may be laughing too hard by the end to pay attention if they did learn the engineering parts. 




 In my experience as a Biosystems Engineering grad student, BME students just go to grad school and focus on microbiology or optics a lot more than anything you've talked about.  If you want to do prosthetics, find a professor at a different university and consider the field that his/her appointment is in (whether it's EE, ME, BME, etc).

The two things you mention are very different, so you may want to decide on smart prosthetics (going to be more EE and ME oriented) or the medical substances (probably more BME or material science engineering). 
























 Prosciutto pizza!?! That's pretty classy 




 How's the food there? 




 Just came across these recently and my molecular bio isn't as strong as it should be.  Seems like a new way to treat antibiotic resistant bacteria and other things like Marburg and muscular dystrophy.  How does it work  and why is it better than antibiotics? 




 If only the ISS would test this... 




 This is true. I've seen some truly messed up models as a result of humidity in the support and/or the model material while it's printing.  All you can do is get a new spool and reprint. 









 It'd be nice if they didn't have to use a laser to create the surface.  What I mean by this is that they have to post-process the material after the sheet is made which is going to add to the cost.  The process by which the metal is 'cast' does not produces this surface. 




 In my experience with 3D printed materials, the layers are not laid down perfectly flat on one another and there is a capillary force that pulls liquids through (this applies to FDM, I have no experience with other technologies).  It's possible that if the plastic was heated a little bit closer to being in a liquid state rather than closer to being in a solid state as it is laid down that this might solve the problem, but then things might get runny. 

Also that there is a scaffold interior instead of a solid material isn't going to help with the out gassing problem (I'm assuming you mean the gas in the interior of the part is coming out of the part not the material itself is off gassing). Perhaps if a part was printed solidly it would be less noticeable as the space would be filled with material. 




 How would you adapt today's technology towards medical applications that require sterilization either of bulk material or the final printed product such that they can be FDA approved? Are new materials that aren't currently printed with necessary or is something like PLA that is widely used capable to fill this void? 




 Do you mind some old PDFs from when I took a SolidWorks class?  

Also, check out www.vertanux1.com

I've been learning PTC Creo from him and he's been great.  Maybe check out the final/midterm for SolidWorks/Inventor (or whatever he has, I've been focused on Creo).

 So this seems to be kind of an odd problem that is currently driving me crazy.  Basically what happened is that my school (university) converted all student email accounts to the Gmail based ones that are great and last forever.  When I graduated, I was hired temporarily by my adviser while I hunted for a job.  Because of this, my email account was converted to a Microsoft Exchange account.  This means I log into an Outlook Web App to check my email instead of going through the Gmail login.  On my phone, I can't add the new account as an exchange account because it makes a duplicate.  Now I have to use multiple email clients on my phone despite there now being support for Exchange.

The reason I don't just delete the account now that I have a job and don't use it much is that I have all my purchases, subscription (All Access) and that sort of stuff tied to the old Gmail account that I used from my university.  

Is there any way to have the account on my phone, but get the Exchange emails (which may or may not go back to the Gmail account, no one seems able to tell me)? 
























 Not exactly. UV-A refers to UV closer to the blue spectrum while UV-B refers to wavelengths slightly shorter than the ones considered UV-A and UV-C is in between UV-B and X-ray I believe...wikipedia...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet#Subtypes
 




 What would be a theoretical time scale for something like this occurring? (not in real life, but if the gif were in years, how many?) 




 You'll get better at it as you go, so start with what you can manage, then do something else. As you work through it, what you can do will probably increase. Also, not knowing your major, you don't always need to read the whole article to understand what they're claiming and how they did it. This is a big time saver.

Also, organize your stuff. Whether it's Mendeley (my favorite), Endnote, ReadCube, or another program, don't just have a folder on your desktop or documents folder with PDFs floating around. You'll never be able to find anything or you'll take too much time organizing it for it to be effective. 




 I worked with the base uPrint model in grad school and we went off the service plan and there were a ton of issues. I replaced the print head, the chamber fans, the tips (this is more of a they need it eventually thing), and I've even taken the print head off and put it in an oven to get support material that leaked to soften enough so I could hit it with a hammer while it cooled so the thing would switch between the two heads.

When they work, they work great. When they don't, they're awful.

The thing that happened at the base is surprisingly common I would say. Also, the base plates are reusable. Completely. You can either dissolve the material off or take a chisel to it (carefully) and any material will pop off. 




 After spending lots of time on here (and time elsewhere such as Google) I've come up with nothing. 

I'm looking for a 3D printer that can print in wax and ABS/PLA (not necessarily at the same time and not necessarily both ABS/PLA) for work. I know there are printers that will do one or the other, but I haven't found anything. I think the closest has been one of Stratasys's printers but those are ridiculously expensive and my experience in Graduate school left me jaded (Dimension uPrint).

Any help would be much appreciated 




 I had SolidWorks available to me in graduate school and would always add material properties to stuff until it looked the way I wanted and then I would have SolidWorks render the image in 3D and it always looked nice, but may not be as great for chemistry type figures 




 Here's a link to the abstract for anyone who wants it. I haven't been able to read the article yet, but will be doing so sometime today:

Edit: Ok, so I read through the paper and it is interesting, and it does work quite well, but I'm a bit concerned that they're using 1 L of blood as their sample. The tests were compared with traditional tests and found results of sensitivity and specificity that ranged from 100%-77% and 91%-82%.

It seems like a good platform, and yes, current tests today may be less than $34 each, but the start up costs and training are what are the problems IMO. They also said that after clinical trials they were able to improve sensitivity by increasing the antibody spotting concentration on the gold nanoparticles, but that seems kind of obvious. 




 Title is definitely misleading

 As someone who just moved out of one of those cities and into one not on that list...I have made a terrible mistake 




 1984
First time ever. Also watched the movie. 




 Thanks for the review. I'm generally a fan of what they do, but recently it's been a bit of a struggle bus.  It's unfortunate this one didn't live up to their past work, especially V and The Matrix.  Guess I'll probably wait till Netflix or RedBox have it 




 Knowing people who did it and paid for more than I did (I had auto insurance/cell phone covered by parents cause it was convenient and didn't cost them much extra) it's quite possible.  Basically make your own food as much as possible and avoid going out, don't get TV; stick with Netflix, avoid movie theaters.  Traveling is kind of out of the picture, except maybe once per year as is new technology.

Also, live somewhere cheap.  I lived in Tucson where the $15K-$25K stipend is enough. If you pick a place like New York, it won't be and that'll be difficult. 
























 Did no one tell them that storage manufacturers say 1 GB is 1000 MB and most software techs say 1 GB is 1024 MB? 




 How can we say that dark matter isn't the 'aether/ether' of our time similar to how at the turn of the 20th century there was aether/ether to explain things that were eventually explained by general relativity, Brownian motion, and that sort of thing? 




 So you'd be willing to live with clear Coca Cola? 




 I remember seeing something on here about it not too long ago, so that was probably it 




 Now if they combine their printer tech with a bin and component arm to place the LEDs automatically, they'll win. 




 Such a good boy!!! 




 It'd be cool to see a video of this in action 




 This isn't off the Kinnear exit, I might get lost 




 It's a quick read, and enjoyable, but don't set expectations cause you'll be wrong. It's not a bad thing, it's just not Kvothe's perspective so you have to expect it to be very different. 




 I love and hate you at the same time for this photo 




 Sometimes I wonder if more cities (or civil contractors) talked about strategies to deal with what weather does to roads and other infrastructure we'd have a lot better roads. Example: Phoenix has great roads IMO after living there for 18 years. Tucson does not, after living there for 7. The climate is nearly identical and the road quality is significantly different. (Yes, I know, taxes pay for roads and Phoenix has more) 




 Don't complain about that bloatware and Atom chip performance once you get it now :) 




 Has anyone made a miniature version of this to test it? By miniature I mean like model trains miniature.
