 Deakins is a technical genius. 




 Cornetto Trilogy!!! 




 **DONALD GLOVER MOTHERFUCKER!** 




 Like I said, It's just an opinion. 




 YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA! 




 It's comments like that that will earn you a few downvotes. 




 You just spoke about the cinematography of that film, and you didn't mention Emmanuel Lubezki? 




 They should've called this 'Patrick Bateman finds a soul'. 




 Prometheus..? 




 [My Reaction](http://giphy.com/gifs/smiling-watching-12A3hKKsewxtGE/fullscreen) 




 I liked the first one more, second one was....abysmal.  




 all fixed, sorry about that :) 




 If you judge the movie purely as a movie, It is very well made. I haven't seen anyone HATE on it, of course like any war movie it will cause some controversy (remember when The Hurt Locker came out?).
But I really don't really care about the controversy, because I always remember this: It's just a movie!!!!

(Please don't downvote, It's just an opinion) 




 Just thought I would ask /r/movies what there guilty pleasure movie(s) is/are. Mine would probably be Spiderman 3, Machete, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Con Air. Just leave yours in the comments! :)

Edit: Wow thanks for the comments, I never expected this many. But why I am I getting downvoted? :/ 




 keep watching!!!! 




 Maybe not 




 I've only cried in three films. Those are:

* Titanic
* King Kong (2005)
* Big Hero 6

I Know Right!
 




 I've been looking for this! Thanks so much!!!! 




 Just wanted to ask /r/movies what everyone thinks of The Reader, a 2008 film starring Kate Winslet, David Kross and Ralph Fiennes.

Wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reader_%282008_film%29

I think this is an incredible film with powerful and convincing performances from all three leads, this film is certainly not for everyone and it raised quite the controversy when it was released but nonetheless critics and people I know really liked this film. So yeah I just wanted to know what people thought of it, please leave your thoughts and opinion(s) in the comments. :) 




 Yeah that wasn't bad either. 




 "The chainsaw rises" is actually a fucking awesome title. No shit. 




 Am I the only one that thinks the 2004 remake was actaully pretty decent? (Please don't down vote, it's just an opinion). 









 Just wish this post was a little bigger so we get could more interpretations and opinions but thanks anyway!  




 The quote in my opinion may be referring to Riggan Thomson, take it with whatever weight you want but I think it does. 




 At the beginning of the film where the drums play away the letters and start to reveal the title of the film it pauses briefly and across the screen you can see the word 'Amor'. Amor, as it turns out, is the ancient Roman God of love (aka Cupid) Amor is also Latin for 'Love'. I did more research and as it turns out Amor is winged and is often depicted as being blind or blindfolded. Now you must also consider the name of the play that the plot (sort of) revolves around. And know a quote from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Nights Dream:

Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
Nor hath love's mind of any judgement taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.
And therefore is love said to be a child
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.

IMHO this quote is referring to Riggan Thomson (or is it the other way round?) The director and writer, Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu, is not directly linking Riggan to Amor (or Cupid) but simply a homage or tip of the hat. As the title of this post suggests I may be onto something here and if I am then I am no where near fully understanding this reference. I thought I might share this with you guys and perhaps discuss even further. :) 




 In the beginning of the film where the drums reveal the title, it says "amor" very briefly. Amor is latin for 'love', and also Amor is the ancient roman god of love. so you might be onto something. 




 That rape scene was gratuitous or was is supposed to be?  




 If you are genuinely interested in his work, I **highly** recommend the documentary 'A Life in Pictures' it is one of my favorite documentaries and I guarantee you will respect this man a whole lot more after watching it.  




 Thanks for all the downvotes! 




 Hmmmm.....Black Swan...Mila Kunis...and Natalie Portman....I LIKED that movie. 




 It's one of those comment threads where the comments just keep getting funnier as you scroll down. 




 Very well said, you've made a solid point. 




 Roger Ebert gave it 4/4 stars. What's up with that? 




 Zac's character in the film represents reality. 




 Hahahaha, honest to god. 









 Here you are! Well..not exactly.
I suggest you look through these until you find the one you are looking for, hope this helped!
http://screenmusings.org/movie/blu-ray/The-Cell/ 




 We should just clear this up: They shouldn't have remade the movie in the first place. 




 I loved the Neo-Noir element to the nightclub scene, or to the whole movie itself. I hope they keep that up in the sequel. 




 PG-13? Pffft 




 Or not. 




 hahaha this actually made me crack up :D (not being sarcastic) 




 Why did some people not like Watchmen? I really liked it.
(please don't down-vote me guys, it's just an opinion :)) 




 happy? 




 It must get pretty hot under that helmet. 




 Sicario may have a chance... 




 How does he notice the things he notices in film. How indeed. 




 D: 




 *Nightcrawler 




 Into the Wild.
I want to do what he does. 




 We'll see 




 This film will be epic. Lubezki will be at the top of his game, as will Irritu. 




 Do you have any idea who it's directed by? 




 Tom Hardy stealing the movie?? Did you even look at Leo in that photo? 




 Sneaky Little Fucker ain't he. 




 I have read the book, and my Stephen King collection is quite expansive. All I was saying is that I learned that he was nominated for a Razzie, I didn't know that before, but know I do. 









 Now that would just be GIVING it away. 




 Maybe his new film 'The Visit' is good. But then again, maybe not. 




 Everybody in the German army has heard of **Hugo Stiglitz**  




 This album reflects humanity. The good. The bad. And the ambiguity of it. Most of this album is actually a continuous song. Most of it. The songs within this album evoke mostly dark emotions, but they are very relaxing. The lyrics of these songs deal with some very heavy themes. Mostly, like I said, to do with humanity; society. But the themes and ideas displayed in this album is familiar territory for this band. They are certainly not for everyone, they are for me and hopefully for you, too.

[Masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW5iwy69O1U) 




 Yes! But Oh Well, he was nominated for an academy award. 




 Anything Roger Deakins. 




 Just a question but does Micheal Corleone become worse in Part 2? I haven't seen it but I'm just asking. 




 No country for old men is not on the list. COME ON! 




 Christian Bale. He's been in two movies that start with 'American' and he's british! 




 I laughed so hard at that. Holy Shit. 




 Aaron Sorkin...That guy knows how to write a screenplay alright! 




 Hahaha yeah he does, maybe it's just the photoshop. I've seen him with it before though 




 Was the movie any good? 




 shiit. I'll edit it out. 




 Can some of you help me out with this post? It would be very very much appreciated!
http://redd.it/2u1zle 









 Ah that one, I got ya.

 The 57' one? 




 That's exactly what I'm looking for, Thank you. 




 Yeah pretty much any movie that's really heavy going in its subject matter or that just deal with some real heavy and dense themes, just mention em' here. Thanks! 




 He had a serious drug and alcohol problem. They can make the film interesting with that alone. With much character building, good actors, a consistent tone and a solid script, they could pull it off. 




 What we do in the shadows was pretty good. 




 Nah dude. Zodiac, now that's the real "Wow". 




 It is so disappointing that I have to scroll past comments and see racism about a fucking movie. 




 yeah the bad guys could've been better 




 End of Watch was fantastic. Come on dude. 




 **AMEN** 




 **KEEP IT THAT WAY** 




 Then go back into hibernation until Infinity War parts 1   2? 




 As Borat would say: Very Nice! 




 he used a revolver... 




 I genuinely think they are very underrated? Why don't you like them? 




 Who's joking with what? 




 Yes 




 Jarhead   American Beauty 




 That's because of his character, same reason why his character in Nightcrawler hardly blinks. 




 Jake Gyllenhaal hardly blinks in Nightcrawler (2014) 




 Oh Hi Mark! 




 Watch Foxcatcher. 




 Explain Foxcatcher? 




 Haha Lol you're getting down-voted. That's almost as funny as Channing Tatum in Jump street. Also, if he has '"flubbed" every role, explain Foxcatcher? 




 What 




 Yes of course. It's ultimately a character study. 




 It's a slow, tension-building film. Everyone needs to know that before going into this film. 




 Ahhh 




 I have no doubt about it 




 Whats happening...how can you read the script? 




 Someone watched an Honest Trailer. 




 Not yet! But I have ordered the bluray of it. Something tells me it will top John Wick. 




 A revenge tale starring Leonardo DiCaprio directed by Irritu with cinematography by Lubezki and co-starring Tom Hardy? 


JUST TAKE MY MONEY AND GIVE ME THOSE DAMN TICKETS!! 




 Nic Cage is playing an 'ordinary guy'? What is this? 




 Best action scene of 2014, hands down. 




 Doesn't work for me GODDAMMIT 




 Was just going to say that. 




 Dude have you seen True Detective? 




 The desolation of Smaug, the ending was so bad it even ruined the start of BOTFA for me. 




 This is shaping up to be my most anticipated movie of the next 5 years. 




 They won't put that in. 




 The title to this made me lose my shit. 




 Why did Nick choose to stay with Amy? I am completely stumped on this, can someone please help. 




 Bland? That's his character, read the fucking book. 




 Come on people where is Prisoners! 




 Always good to see a fellow Fincher lover. If you haven't seen Zodiac, I couldn't recommend it high enough. 




 Can't go wrong with Zodiac! 




 I got it from Sanity, in Australia. 









 As a fellow Aussie, did you get those at JB? 




 Ah. 




 Can't go wrong with Zodiac! 









 Anyone who is complex, has depth and is perhaps a bit of an anti-hero, please mention them here. 




 The book that is seen on his bedside table, can someone tell me what it is if they saw the title or just happen to know the book? 




 What makes a movie very well directed, what makes a director good or bad? 




 Please mention any movies that have really underrated cinematography and why you recommend them, thanks! 




 A dishonored sequel is definitely in the works or it has already been made. Just wondering what is everyone's thoughts and opinions, also what do and don't you want in this sequel? 




 Please submit your top 10 favorite movies here, I would like to see what I'm missing out on. Here's mine, no order (because it's impossible):

 How do you prove good cinematography?

 Everyone in this thread seems to think I don't have very good taste in cinematography. Yes, I have seen many, many films; but Interstellar has some of the best cinematography I've seen in a while. Some of my favorite DP's include Roger Deakins, Emmanuel Lubezki, Robert Elswit, Conrad L Hall, Vittorio Storaro.  

Some of my favorite films feature astounding cinematography these include American Beauty, Blade Runner, Alien, No Country For Old Men, There will be blood, Fight Club, Zodiac, Se7en, Inglorious Bastards and many others.

It's just my opinion, but I think Hoyte van Hoytema did a very good job in this film along with Chris Nolan.

 For those of you who have seen it, why is it getting bad/mixed reviews? What's wrong with it? How could they improve it? 




 Seen it. Love it. 




 There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary   Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, dry, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it. Not to mention the top-notch voice acting from Philip Seymour Hoffman, Toni Collette and Barry Humphries.
 [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_and_Max)


 









 Why all the hate for daredevil? 




 ahhh.....YES. 




 Direction is kinda weak at times and 'one note'.

The acting is pretty good.

Writing can be a bit flat at times but overall it's ok.

The cinematography...do I have to say anything? Roger Deakins yet again delivers a visual feast, every frame is crisp and balanced, the lighting is beautiful; it deserved that oscar nod. 




 Pumped for the movie? 




 Did you guys like it or not?  




 Tell me a bluray that you are willing to trade, the condition and region code.

This is REGION B only and in pretty good condition. 




 This just made my day. 




 Blade Runner and The Empire Strikes Back. 




 I totally agree. 




 Adaptation.

Irreversible

End of Watch

Anything Wes Anderson

Mary   Max (HIGHLY recommend)

 




 Paul Giamatti. 
Imagine [him](http://www.tvweek.com/blogs/tvbizwire/paul-giamatti.jpg) in full pennywise mode.
 




 So lets just start by saying that my eyes get really itchy when hop into bed. I don't know what is is but as soon as I lay down, they get all tingly and irritated.
So most nights I lay there rubbing my eyes for about 5 minutes or until I think enough is enough. 
I then usually stumble out of my room into the kitchen to get a cold flannel to put on my face.
The previous night I decided to put a flannel in the freezer to put on my face/eyes if they become itchy, which they did. 
So I got into the kitchen and staggered over to the freezer, seeing nothing but colors and shapes from the good, vicious and long rubbing that I gave them (come on it feels good), I opened the freezer (all lights were off btw) and grabbed the first thing that felt like a nice thick frozen flannel. I then zombie-walked my way back to my room and put the ice-cold solid piece of heaven on my face. 

Well I woke up the next morning; the pillow was red and so was most of my face. 
I thought I was in that scene from The Godfather, seriously, I was shitting bricks.
I then feel a soggy, warm and wet sludge-y like presence against my upper back/neck area. 
Well what do you know? It was the steak I was supposed to cook the previous night, wrapped in glad/plastic wrap. Most of the blood had leaked out from it and onto my face, pillow and some of my sheets. 
And of course the REAL frozen flannel was sitting in the freezer where I had left it. I swear it winked at me. 




 Are they? I didn't know that. 









 I would be great if you guys could give me some recommendations and advice, a link to a website that sells them would be great as well. Thanks in advance. 




 Google Images and trailer screenshots... 














 Why thank you 




 It does a little. 









 Wow dude, thanks for all that advice. Just a few questions:

What did you mean by 'some shitty bundle?'

Also, do know know any websites/books/resources that you think is a good starting point for somebody who wants to be a cinematographer?
 









 Can you guys give me some advice and point me in the right direction? It would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance! 




 Never seen The Breakfast Club.

Goodbye all my karma 




 That's the best damn summery I've ever heard.  









 I love every single one of PTA's films. Sure he's not for everyone, but he's my kind of filmmaker; dialogue heavy, contain dense and relevant themes, real and exuberant characters and top-notch writing and directing. 




 He's certainly not for everyone. 




 Not a PTA fan? 









 Good to see Inherent Vice on the list, was not expecting it. 




 Tell me, is your father a happy man?

 




 Just looking for anything that analyses the work of PTA. Please leave a link in the comments. Thanks! 




 In the T.V section, when I saw the words 'True' and 'Detective', I jizzed. 




 Why's that? 




 What did you think of Inherent Vice? (I'm asking everybody this) 




 She was a demon. 




 Nice to see Inherent Vice high up on the list. What did you like about it? 









 I have no idea why you are being downvoted, you made a sold point. 




 What about pro feminist? Because I've heard some people call it that. 




 Same here.  









 This thread is turning into the official discussion page for 'Inception' when it was released. 




 WHY are you getting downvoted? That's really quite pathetic. 




 I prefer them both the same, they are completely different genres. 




 For me it was Killer Joe, Se7en and The Chaser. 




 My vote for Zodiac made it in! :D 









 Yes! Thank you for commenting! I really want to get this video out there, it should be this video that has the most amount of views instead of some bullshit music video. So if you can, share this video with your friends and family. Like he said in the video, we can use the internet to unite and come closer. Thanks again. 




 I love every frame a painting. Watch his video on David Fincher. 









 So you have your mid shot, close up, long shot etc, but what exactly is an unconventional shot? I am new to cinematography. Please leave a response and an example from a film or something. Thanks a heap! 




 Snatch. 




 Start with South Korean films like:

* **The Chaser** (2008) HIGHLY recommend.

* **A Bittersweet life** (2005)

* **The Revenge Trilogy**

* **Snowpiercer** (2013-14)

And whatever else you can find :)
 




 No order:

**Edge of Tomorrow**

**Source Code**

**Inception**

**District 9**

**Interstellar** (Please don't downvote because of this)

**The World's End**

**Gravity** (or this)

**Oblivion**

**Wall-E**

**Pacific Rim** 




 Curious Case?  




 Oh, you have NO idea 









 District fucking 10. 




 This is the last director I'd expect to direct this. 
Nonetheless, he is a fantastic director. Just watch Prisoners.
 




 No Country for old men.

I would be hear for hours explaining the meaning of this film, so I'm just going to leave this here:
http://www.rogerebert.com/scanners/no-country-for-old-men-out-in-all-that-dark
 




 I wanna see Christoph Waltz as Franz Oberhauser! 




 True. Like women, r/movies is just one of those things that we'll never fully understand.

Goodbye all my karma. 




 [Zodiac](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443706/?ref_=nv_sr_1) (2007), David Fincher 




 Won't that be the day... 




 In your opinion, what is a really good poster? 




 I agree, I was very surprised that Gone Girl didn't get a nod for best adapted. 




 What's your opinion? 




 Please don't tell me that you're one of those people who haven't seen all the performances. 




 Rosamund was ROBBED. 




 Look at his face, and imagine him in clown makeup. 




 It's my favorite book, and it will be co-written and directed by the guy directed one of my favorite tv shows (True Detective) so I am hoping this turns out good.

Here's a few links: 
http://screencrush.com/cary-fukunaga-it-very-scary/

http://screenrant.com/stephen-king-it-movies-2015-2016-director/

 




 Sources aswell as the producer have said that the remake will be much more true to the book, it will be dark, gritty and very violent. 




 Who are you supposed to be talking to? 




 AND simon pegg???? I thought he was the main character? 




 See what happens when you fuck a pussy in the face! 




 [Mary and Max](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_and_Max)

My favorite stop motion animation film and also my favorite black comedy.

I URGE you to watch it. 




 He would've made a great Pennywise. But even then he played the Joker so I don't think he would've accepted the role. 




 I was thinking Paul Giamatti 




 I actually agree with you. 




 You are on reddit movies my friend, it's just what's going to happen. 









 You're judging from a picture? That's mature. 




 Why the hell are you getting down-voted? 




 This is awesome news. But not as good as the day when I open my r/movies feed and see 'District 9 sequel announced'. 




 Michael Bay 




 Why can't this be the bluray cover? 




 Yeah this has been questioned over and scrutinized for years. I don't actually know, I think it's just an easter egg. 




 That's a dick thing to say. 




 It's annoying because I can't prove to you that I have not downvoted anyone on this thread. 




 Well for starters, and I forgot to mention this, but Cuaron did not deserve Best Director, that should've gone to McQueen. 
Best Picture nod for Gravity was, to the academy, a no-brainer but come on BEST picture? That nomination should've gone to Prisoners.
An Bullock nominated for best actress? really? That nomination should've gone to Emma Thompson or someone whose performance was better.
When I said 'that years gravity' to 'Shakespeare in love' I did mean nominations as well as wins. 




 It did win other awards... 




 Sure It deserved awards, just the amount that it won. There were much better films in terms of story, substance and acting. 




 Peanuts? more like the small bits of salt that are ON peanuts. 




 Such a rob 




 That year's 'Gravity' 




 Any move that won a major oscar like best picture, actor, director, whatever, just leave it in the comments :) 




 I was thinking L.a confidential for a sec before you said it was released within the past few years. 




 Yeah that 'joke' almost made me fall out of my chair, I was so not prepared for something so....crude? But yeah I didn't know what to think. That's not to say she didn't have a good ass! 




 I love it. It's such an adventure. 




 The church scene is easily one of the best action scenes of the year. 




 Starting a Bluray collection and I just want to ask r/movies what are some essential movies to own on Bluray? 




 Why the downvote? :/ 




 The ending to Se7en. 




 /r/Chris_Stuckmann
Turns out there already is one 




 Im trying to make a stylesheet for it but I dont know shit about CSS 




 Now that you said it, it actually is okay. 




 We should do it together. What do you say?
I think he'll appreciate it. 




 That's okay, just don't fuck it up. Cough *alien resurrection* cough 









 What camera did you use? 




 Can't wait for this. 




 I'll be sure to do that next time
 




 Thanks so much! 




 Thank you! 




 I remember watching this trailer that was a spin off/parody of the cheesy 80's retro action movies, it was a bit like Far Cry 3: Blood dragon in its style and in the trailer it was about a vigilante cop type-a guy who is sent back to fight the Nazis but is instead sent back to the dinosaur age. I know it sounds really weird but the trailer was awesome and anyone who knows about this movie please comment the title or link to trailer in the comments. Much appreciated :) 




 This may become the highest grossing film of all time. 




 I don't see why you were downvoted for that, you made a very solid point. Upvoted :) 




 Detective Loki from Prisoners. 




 With Reddit I really feel a sense of community and I can't get that by just searching it on Google. I want people's personal opinions and examples of what Neo-Noir is and sure I can find that on Google but like I said, I'd rather ask r/movies. Also just looking through your comments you really do look like you enjoy condescending and picking apart peoples opinions, so please, don't get angry over little stuff like this. :) 




 Holy shit thanks for that!!! 




 Well do you have a better choice?  




 I could search it on Google, but I'd rather ask /r/movies instead. I've been hearing those two words ever since I really started having a passion for movies, and I never really payed attention. But now I think it's about time I started to find out what it is. Please don't down vote just because I don't know what it is.

 How can something like that even exist?

 tell me what it is! 




 I don't even know anymore. 




 Okay what the actual fuck 




 what is this?

But yeah what is the most fucked up subreddit on here?

 I guess they are really saving Vision for the main event.

 Yes! FINALLY, same here!!!

The whole time I was thinking of Lancaster Dodd. 




 I'm mad at the fact that they can do something like that. I said 'how' they broke up their marriage, not 'that' they broke up their marriage. 




 Wow, you're judging my intelligence because I got an expression wrong....hmmmm okay. 




 Read my previous reply :) 




 Maybe I'm over-reacting a bit, and I normally take documentaries with a grain of sand, but this just really got to me. I just cannot believe what these bastards have gotten away with and how they treat their people. How they practically used people, such as Tom Cruise, to gain power and superiority. Also, how they basically destroyed his marriage to Nicole Kidman. Don't even get me started on that bastard Miscavige....

Like I said, how true can all this be? It seems pretty legit to me. I just wanted to see if anyone else feels the same way :) 









 this just puts mine to shame... 




 sorry all the photos are sideways 









 1. It (hmmmm bring me that remake)

2. The Stand

3. Bag of Bones

4. The Talisman

5. Pet Sematary 




 I feel the exact same way....about Spirited Away. 









 Has anyone heard anything? 




 I cannot remove the palm off my face... 




 Yeah the one I ordered from the UK was region B. Yeah I saw on eBay the ones from Japan were like $98!!! But yeah I was just wandering if they were actually releasing an Australian edition :) 




 I live in Australia, I just ordered the bluray out of the UK! Do you know if they are releasing it in Australia? 









 So you liked Spirited Away?

[This man](https://www.google.com.au/?gws_rd=ssl#q=hayao+miyazaki+movies) is a god, watch all of his films including the documentary they made about him recently.

Also, the [studio](https://www.google.com.au/?gws_rd=ssl#q=studio+ghibli+movies) he works for, watch all of their movies as well.  




 A Bioshock film. 




 Nightcrawler

Whiplash

Foxcatcher

Birdman 









 Killer Croc in Suicide Squad? Man this just keeps getting better and better.  




 Scene it. Pun intended. 









 I love Dredd, pity we won't be getting a sequel :/ 





























 At one point, you didn't know either. 




 what does TL:DR stand for? :P 









 Clint Eastwood hasn't directed a straight up comedy, not that I am aware of, so my guess is that it will be serious. 














 My respect for this man and his work just went through the fucking roof after my first viewing, I implore you to watch it. 









 Well I want to be a cinematographer, so really anything at all will do :) 









 Thank you very much 




 **I posted something similar to this on r/cinematography, but only few people could help me** 

I just wanted to see if you guys had some more/better recommendations. Any book to do with the art of visual storytelling or cinematography will be much appreciated. Thanks! 




 "You could land a jumbo fuckin jet in there!" 









 I am speechless. Your sir, deserve an award. 









 Watch 127 hourse.

James Franco KNOCKS IT OUT OF THE PARK. 




 I think this will be great.

The director clearly understands the character, as seen with that awesome test footage. 









 So I should? 




 Should I tag for NSFW? 









 What the fuck is going on here? 




 The work of Cujo... 




 [Very Naice!](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1979623485/borat.jpg) 









 [Very Nice](http://cdn.meme.am/instances/400x/11518290.jpg)

 




 Mr Brando himself. 









 Any books that would be good for someone learning about cinematography. Much appreciated! 




 I came here expecting everyone to be hating on it, I was pleasantly surprised. 




 Ha! 




 Fuck me. Source Code, End of Watch, Enemy, Prisoners, Nightcrawler and now this. Gyllenhaal's career is going the roof. 




 i'll check it out 




 wow, thanks a lot for that. 









 why all the downvotes? :/ 




 Marvel movies are my thing...

In a nutshell, I think recently with The Winter Soldier, marvel movies are becoming more cinematic. I think this is happening with AoU as well.

Read the link I sent the other guy. 




 I probably should've gone into a little more detail, but yeah that's exactly what I mean. 




 I shall. 




 What I mean is I didn't feel that the first one had the characteristics of a film, it didn't present itself as a MOVIE. I know that sound ridiculous and I probably will be downvoted but it's just how I feel. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED The Avengers, but throughout my life I wanted to see the characters that I grew up with put into a motion picture. Unfortunately, It just felt like an entertaining but shallow action film. I wanted more, I wanted a more 'cinematic' feel and look to it, and now I think that Joss Whedon has implemented this 'feel' into AoU, just judging by the 3 trailers. You get me

Edit: http://redd.it/2gxnax 

This guy knows what I am talking about, haha I just found this. 









 One of my biggest gripes with the first Avengers is that is wasn't cinematic enough. To me, it just didn't have that feel. From what I've seen as far as trailers go, I think the film has a much more 'cinematic' vibe to it. I can't say for sure, as I have not seen it yet. I hope it does turn out to be like that, as I believe that's how superhero movies SHOULD feel. Anyone else feel the same way? I would love the discuss this further. :) 




 So happy to hear that. I've actaully played a little bit of unity, the combat was great, as were the costumes, weapon selection and world design. I think it's worth getting just for those things alone. I've heard bad things about the missions and the story and lots of bugs. 




 I understand what it is like to lose someone close to you. That feeling of dread as the day they passed away on comes around. I've heard mixed things about Unity, I was thinking of giving it a chance as well. I hope you make it through the next week okay, like I said, PM me whenever. I will listen to anything you have to say. 




 Totally, talk to to me about anything. I used to play PC, my rig was soooo shit (i played on intel HD graphics). I played games like far cry 2 (one of my all time favs), skyrim, mark of the ninja, counter strike, the first assassins creed( again one of my favs). just games like that really, buuuuut i recently got a PS4, what an upgrade right? It's been great, i've just loaded up on games like gta 5, AC black flag, watch dogs and far cry 4. some of them are a little too disturbing for my taste (watch dogs) by i enjoyed all of them.

when you do finish work and go to the gamestore etc just have a think about the things we've been talking about previously, that should help a little.  




 Nice to hear! It feels good to be helping a person out like this, i am soo glad you are actually determined about making a change. Huskys are beautiful creatures. I never mentioned, i loved video games as well, feel free to talk to me about them. If your co workers are like that then yeah I do understand your situation, at least you have your cousin, family can be friends as well. Insurgent? not bad at all. summer (in america) is coming up so that's when all the awesome movies come out, like i cannot wait for Avengers age of ultron. 

If you don't mind, every few days i would like to PM you just to see how you are doing. 




 I am so happy that this is getting you to think. Please tell me what you want to do after your shift. Dogs are great, I recommend you look into that.

As for your coworkers, I see the problem. I think you can still form friendships among them, even if your interests are different. You strike up small talk and just go from there. Are they friendly? I find that talking about recent news, world events etc works a lot of the time, as most people are interested in these things.

Most of all I think you need time to yourself. I mean like taking a day off work as I mentioned or doing alternative things after work like going to the park, beach etc these things can help more than you think; just some peaceful time for self reflection. If you do end up watching the films I recommended please tell me what you think of them and if they impacted/affected you in any way. 




 Hmmmm yeah you really need to watch those movies I recommended. Fight Club changed me as a person, as did American Beauty, as both of the main characters in those films were just like me a few years ago and little bit like you too. If I changed, I believe you can too.

You said you have a full time job. Why not start looking for friends there? Or maybe a girlfriend. 

As for the drive home, eat dinner, bed at 10 thing, you really need to change that, as I can see that's part of what's dragging you down. Who told you that you HAVE to go to bed at 10? Who ever said you HAVE to go to work? Or even come home from work? Just take the day off one day, go to the park or beach or movies, just have a day to yourself. Pick a sunny, BEAUTIFUL day. Also, how about a pet? Dogs can be best, BEST friends. They can cheer you up, you can take them for walk, talk to them etc. You don't have to do the exact same crap everyday, no one ever said you did. We were put on this earth to live, you feel the emotions embedded in us, not be prisoners unto ourselves, and not to waste away our days. Is that how you want to remember your life? Doing the same things everyday? 




 I just re-read your post, I apologize for talking so much about myself; I feel like a dick. Here's me all Mr self-improved talking about my life and my happiness. I really do want to help you, I know that feeling, that feeling of just withering away slowly.  




 I know exactly how you feel. 

I used to be like you.

I recommend you watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipe6CMvW0Dg)

I keep happy using these 3 principles:

**1. (The most important IMO) Lotsa good movies, books, music and T.v shows**

That's right. I mentally deteriorate if I don't get good entertainment. It's important to me, it is what I value. I try to go to the movies as often as possible and I collect blurays and try to watch a movie a day. I also listen to a wide variety of music. Good music, not shit. This includes Elton John, Pink Floyd, ELO, Queen, David Bowie etc. Good books do the job as well. I LOVE Stephen King and I LOVE batman comics. That's just me. It's things like this that make us human.

**2. FRIENDS!**

You NEED people to talk to, it is an absolute necessity. And remember, it's QUALITY not QUANTITY. I have a medium-ish circle of friends who I am all close to, and they love me and I love them! If you are having a shitty day then you can ALWAYS talk to a friend about it, they will always listen, and that can help more than you may think.

**3 AN ESTABLISHED WAY OF SEEING THE WORLD THAT ISN'T NEGATIVE**

You need to know where are are and what you are. That may sound stupid, but you need to embrace everything. You are a living organism. We were not created by a superhuman being or whatever, unfortunately we won't find out until the day we die. But until that day we need to LIVE. Don't waste away your time, you are a human being for christ sake!! MAKE YOUR MARK ON THIS EARTH, you will only live once!! You need to have your own way of seeing things that isn't overly pessimistic or optimistic. I am a little bit in between. Also, try not to worry to much. I know a few people who let things like world hunger, poverty, terrorist attacks etc get to them, and I can see how much it drags them down. Don't let that terrible stuff get in your way!!! The way I see it, it's all background noise, unless it comes to me, which it never does.

Anyway, enough about me. Tell me about you. I really do want to help you out, and I will try my best.

Also, watch the following films (they helped me):

American Beauty (1999)

Birdman (2014)

Fight Club (1999) 

Silver Linings Playbook (2012)

Hope this helped, please respond!! 



 









 I misunderstood what you were saying when you said that it reminded you of the painter. I thought it was a condescending insult.

So what if people circlejerk? As soon as a talented director, actor etc starts being praised by a number of people they just accuse them of circlejerking.  




 I would genuinely find that interesting, thank you. 

So your comparing my drawing (which was a VERY quick sketch btw) to that of a down syndrome painter?

Also, why did you tell me to shut up in the first place? Do people discussing cinematography usually piss you off? 




 I love SoS, have you heard the Alchemy Live version? It's like the original except on steroids. 




 ??? 




 If I made a list, that film would be on it alright. 




 This is actually making me laugh. Come one dude, you started this, and to be honest I don't want this to go on any further. 

Also, would a 9 or 10 year old draw inspiration from artists such as Tim Burton and Ralph Steadman to draw a character from a **PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON FILM?**  




 I've just been looking through your profile. How old are you? 




 Apocalypse Now, The Godfather I   II, The Last Emporer and The Conformist are fucking amazing. 









 I see what you mean.  




 *reincarnation 




 As is Skyfall and most of Deakins' other films, including Unbroken. 




 Also, which ones do you think match a film **perfectly**? 




 His upcoming film the revenant, may just be it.
I don't see any oscar caliber perfomances in the months to come, but what can I say? I haven't seen all the films this year but the only oscar territory perfomances I can see coming up so far are Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs and Leo as Hugh Glass in 'The Revenant' (did you see the image they release of him!? JESUS he looks intense) 




 Range? That's ok, I understand what you mean. 

But if you want to see range from him just watch What's Eating Gilbert Grape. 




 2007.

No Country for Old Men 

Zodiac

There Will be blood

And countless others, I would be here forever. 




 We got Drive in 2011... 




 Why's that?
 




 He's just cruisin' along. 




 Personally, I enjoyed the first. The second? Not so much. To me the second volume was Von Trier's typical pessimistic style of film making and to a degree the first volume as well. But the ending to the 2nd volume really bothered me. As I stated before, It is a very pessimistic film. You are basically watching a character on a downward spiral, but the 2nd volume just went full Von Trier-hate the world mode, and I did not appreciate it.

Back to the first volume. Like I said, I genuinely enjoyed the first film. Although I would not watch it again, it was probably the most realistic you can get when covering that subject matter, and it didn't go over the top with it. Now you're probably think to yourself 'well, yes it did. Just look at the sex scenes!'. But the thing is, like I said, this is the most **realistic** take on this subject matter as you can get. And so while the graphic and sometimes unwatchable sex scenes are pretty intense, they are not over the top and gratuitous; they are simply realistic.

Anyway, that's my thoughts on the film. Please don't downvote! There is no need to as these are just my opinions. Yes I know my grammar is all over the place; I am not much of a writer.
I would love to here your thoughts on the films, like I said, please don't downvote if you disagree just post your argument in the comments and I will be happy to discuss :) 




 thank you for that...
 




 I know :'( 




  Michael Keaton in Birdman or The Unex- no 














 Interstellar

Moon

Interstellar

Moon 




 State of Play I thought was underrated. 




 *Extinction.  




 Yes, this will dominate the oscars. 




 Given the fact that Skyfall was one of the best Bonds in recent memory, how do you think they will top it? 

I would love to hear your skepticism or excitement for this film!

edit: why am I being downvoted? 




 Is that a Dark Knight reference? 




 For what purpose did he sacrifice everything to become a whistleblower? 




 Please keep this EXTREMELY basic but please do include specific examples. Thanks! 




 The Revenant may be it... 














 Ohhh I thought it was the complete opposite
 




 Yes I have 




 What is this subreddit actually about? Apparently you guys don't like Chris Nolan films..

SOMEONE PLS EXPLAIN! 




 This whole subreddit is about posting stills from movies... 
























 Where did you get all your star wars knowledge from? did you build it up over time? From where? 




 What IS canon? 




 Because of the force awakens right? 




 Thanks, do you have a link to where I can buy it? 




 I need to expand my knowledge of the SW universe, what are some good books, websites, tv shows etc that can help with this? I want to know more about the whole world including people, events, planets etc. Thank you very much!

Also, just a side question, what do we know so far about Episode 7's villain Kylo Ren? What is his place in the universe? 




 NSFW just in case. 









 Somebody needs to edit it onto the Batman v Superman trailer 




 I forget the name but there is one about the making of Apocalypse Now. Heart of Darkness I think it's called, it's about how much of a fucking nightmare the production of the film was.

Also, there's another one about film vs.digital cameras, the evolution of them both, which is better and why and where they are both going as in the future. It's called by Side by Side. 




 Fallout: Mad Max

Not that that's a bad thing... 




 Where is a good place on the net to start learning about the basics? Things like the different types of cameras, lenses, cameras in general and just the technical part of cinematographer, if someone could link me to a website, video etc that covers the basics of these topics, I would much appreciate it!

Also, does anyone know of any REALLY good books/essays on cinematography that would help a beginner like me?

And finally, does anyone know of any cinematography analysis videos/ essays? Anything that analyzes famous scenes or shots from films, or just analyzing someones work in general.

Thanks in advance!!

 Really? 




 That means every DC movie up until then will have IMAX scenes. 




 Murph 




 I am no pleb, I am a disciple of /r/moviescirclejerk 




 Thanks 




 He had a small role in Lincoln (2012). He was pretty good in that, but Daniel Day Lewis devours the screen. 




 What does that stand for? 




 American Beauty and Fight Club made me have a completely different outlook on life. After watching those films, I decided that I would NOT get a job where I'm stuck in an air conditioned room for hours on end doing a job I hate. I thought that waking up every morning at 7:00 and driving to the same place in the same clothes doing the same shit was NOT the definition of life and living. Unfortunately, I find myself looking down at these people who are stuck in this world; prisoners unto themselves and their jobs. I need to live, I can't be held back by working for people I despise. I want to be a cinematographer, a job where I can be outside and in different environments using my hands and skills to create films; a job where I meet different people, a job that I can learn and grow into.

Also, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipe6CMvW0Dg) youtube video also helped shape my new way of thinking.   




 If you liked it, check out Lock, Stock and two smoking barrels as well!! 




 That would be Snatch.

Awesome movie. 




 Well this is interesting. I actually liked the first one, but it's faults were definitely in it's writing. Fingers crossed for this and Blomkamp's Alien film, which I am skeptical about. 




 Only a poster.
http://i.imgur.com/0rlgnID.jpg

I should imagine we'll get one within the next 2 weeks.

edit: He said on Twitter it comes out this week 




 http://screenrant.com/girl-dragon-tattoo-movie-sequels-fire-hornets-web/ 









 I was just waiting for the fucker to bite the guys arm off. 




 * Daniel Day Lewis - Daniel Plainview, There Will Be Blood

* Brad Pitt - Tyler Durden, Fight Club

* Jake Gyllenhaal - Detective Loki, Prisoners - Louis Bloom, Nightcrawler

* Not a movie but Mathew Mcconaughey - Rustin Cohle, True Detective

 




 This may be the next Guardians of the Galaxy. I mean, sure I have my doubts, but this looks like a fun movie just judging from the trailer. Kids will enjoy, maybe even the parents. This could be a fun film the whole family can enjoy. Just kidding, this will probably be fucking terrible. 









 Yeah true. When the new 'It' remake comes out, I think it'll be very very good. It might have what your looking for, as it is about friendship and growing up, just with an evil ass demonic alien in there somewhere. (The book) is a beautiful coming of age story, I highly recommend it. But yeah the movie when it comes out will be just what you're looking for if it's good, which I'm sure it will be.
(I mean come on, the remake is written and will be directed by the same guy who did True Detective!) 




 Im looking forward to The Visit. Looks like M. Night is going back to his roots with this one. Fingers crossed! 




 Dazed   Confused...? 




 I love it. I love Finchers style, so smooth and subtle and not over the top. I love the twisted eerie soundtracks that he uses in his films, I also love his under-lit environments. He'll do over a hundred takes of a scene just to get it right, I think people need to appreciate that. Apparently the other 2 are still going to happen, which makes me very happy. If you liked this then definitely check out his other films, especially Zodiac.   




 "Honey, get the shot gun" 




 "Do you bleed? You will"

That is an epic ass line. 









 We'll need more info 




 I wish. 




 [What Batman thinks about your opinions of the new trailer](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/037/e/1/middle_finger_batman_by_babs9-d5u3guy.jpg) 




 Is it as intense and sleek as the first 2? 




 Please don't spoil anything or give away too much, I'm just looking for some opinions on S3, is it as good as the others?

Thanks! 




 Anything that analyses the graphic novel. A link to a website or video would be great! I missed a lot of stuff in the book, i really want a better understanding. Also, the same for Arkham Asylum, anyone know a good analysis for that? Thanks a lot!! 




 oh... 




 The statue is not CGI, or the graffiti.

At some point in the film, public opinion will go against superman. Maybe something will happen, I don't know. 

When that 'something' happens, that's arguably where Bats comes into it.

People will turn against Superman in this movie, he might lose friends, politicans will want him, the military will want to contain him, all sorts of variables have been brought into the game as described by the teaser. So despite all this, will superman lose it? Will he lose faith in humanity? How do we know he won't be influenced by a villain, or be corrupted in some sort of way? The theory is that batman will be this sort of test, physically he wouldn't be much of a test, but mentally he would be.  




 Oh damn
 




 Wassat? 




 An old Joker.

Imagine the possibilities...  









 I've never seen a film in IMAX. How good is it, honestly? 




 Is this IMAX quality?  




 OP, can you please explain? 




 Because if you've seen the film Birdman, you'd understand. Also, it's a parody/turn on [this](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=birdman+poster biw=1536 bih=731 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=IjwzVZT2B4X5mAWdpIHoDg sqi=2 ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ#imgrc=5P4cztbW0Xn-nM%253A%3BMNdGgvPqs7I3DM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.impawards.com%252F2014%252Fposters%252Fbirdman_xxlg.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.impawards.com%252F2014%252Fbirdman_xxlg.html%3B1278%3B2000) poster

 Ok, does he kick ass? 




 Without spoiling it, how much is Vision in the film? Pls don't say too much! 




 I feel jealous, because you had the absolute pleasure of watching it a first time.  




 wow, thanks for that.

However, could you elaborate a little more on why batman and superman fight? What did you mean by batman testing supermans resolve?  




 Did Batman ever take any shit? ahaha 




 As of yesterday, a cross between Whiplash and Birdman. 

Yes, I shit you not. 




 Now that you mentioned it, I totally agree. I thought Gosling was supposed to be directing it, my bad! 




 What can you guys learn about this bruce wayne from the trailer? Any comment/speculation would be much appreciated!

I'm trying to get a solid idea of what this portrayal of batman is about. What are his motives and values? I can tell that this is a completely different BW/Batman altogether, I just want to know why? 




 I hope this happens, but I'm not sure if Gosling is the right choice.  














 what? 




 Instead of exhausting Batman's origin story, put him in a completely new setting with characters and themes that we haven't seen before.
I was thinking of a Arkham Asylum-ish story. Never have we seen Batman psychologically torn, put him right in the middle of insanity, and see how he pushes through it. Now THAT would be interesting.

For those of you who don't know, Arkham Asylum: A serious house on serious earth is a graphic novel, arguably one of the most disturbing and dark. Basically what it is about is there has been an outbreak in AA and Batman has been requested by the Joker, so he has to go over there to sort everything out. Ultimately, it's a psychological horror book. 

The book deals with themes of insanity, and it literally looks like and is meant to symbolize a nightmarish ordeal. What I am trying to get to is that this would be a completely new on-screen reincarnation of the character.

 I think we need to see a human, vulnerable and scared batman.
Maybe we've already seen that with Nolan's trilogy, but I just really want to see Batman and insanity in the same movie together, and to see how he deals with it and vice versa.

Also, I think going with this tone and story, would bring a completely different take on the DC villains. So batman locks up these villains in insane asylums and prisons, then what? They are left to whither and die in filthy and disgusting environments. Seeing this I think would be brilliant. 

Let me know your thoughts! I would love to hear other people's opinions on this. Yes I know, I am no writer. If you still don't know what I am trying to say, just comment or PM me, I'll be happy to elaborate.

TL;DR- I want to see [this](http://www.merlininkazani.com/images/games/7764/galeri_4.jpg) on screen. 




 where can I get me one of those figurines? 

ARRGHHH PLEASE TELL ME! 




 Reservoir dogs  




 Since the first season did feel like a 8-9 hour long movie. 









 A have heard talk of a stand alone batman film, DC have announced it, but it is far from production. 




 At first I was laughing, then I remembered that this movie is actually coming out, then I cried. 




 Legend. 




 Hahaha 









 No order:

- Avengers

- Star Wars (hmm that trailer though)

- Spectre

- Mission Impossible Rogue Nation

- The Revenant 

Edit: also movies like fantastic four, ant man, Jurassic world, Southpaw I am also looking forward to. 




 Fight Club style? 




 Oh damn. 

This film is going to be biblical.  




 I recently watched the documentary 'The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness'. **SPOILER AHEAD** It says at the end that he has retired, but on his retirement sheet/form or whatever it says that he wishes to continue making anime for 10 more years. What does this mean? Is he working on something right now? I am so confused, I have found so many different things on the internet about what is going on with him. Can somebody PLEASE explain what is happening? Thanks so much!!

**I DON'T WANT HIM TO RETIRE :'(** 




 I just googled your whole description except for the beginning. 

I think the movie you are talking about is Wild (2014) 




 I doubt it. I think he took the pictures with a very good camera and later uploaded them to instagram via his computer. 




 I have asked people, they say I am not selfish and they say that I do not sound that way. Maybe it's just them trying to be nice. I just feel I sound that way, I'm not sure if people think the same or different to be honest. I said 'I' way too many times in this comment :/ 




 No of course not. 




 Thank you very much 




 I find that when I talk to people I sound snobby and selfish. I feel like the tone of how I talk sounds like only my opinion matters. I do not have any of these intentions however, It's just how I feel I sound. How do I get rid of this? I don't want to come off any selfish to people, as I am not a selfish person. Any help would be much appreciated, if you want me to elaborate further just ask! Much Thanks! 




 Oh, I got mine from JB-Hi-Fi, they had The Wind Rises, Kiki's Delivery Service and this. 




 Yep 




 Where did you get it? 




 You are welcome :) 




 Where's Spirited Away? O_O 




 Sleuth?  




 O.O

*sigh* Now I need to watch it again.. 




 You can get one [here](https://www.mightyape.com.au/product/Howls-Moving-Castle-10th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition-Blu-rayDVD/22816515) 




 Haha, I was in the shop just looking for the normal bluray for Howls moving castle when I look towards the end of the isle and I see a stand with that edition sitting on it. I just stared at it for 30 seconds straight. Then, as plain as a robot, I put the normal bluray back onto the shelf, walked towards the 10th anniversary edition, picked it up bought it, and marched out of the shop. My face was as blank as paper. 




 I wish they did one for Spirited Away.... 




 I am looking forward to ALL of those as well, also the new Steve Jobs movie is going to be awesome as well. 




 For The Revenant Im guessing. 



















 Absolute shite. 




 I was too goddamn late, but thank you. 




 The Godfather part 2. Because I haven't seen it and it's meant to be one the greatest films of all time. 









 Sorry, but what goes on here? Can someone please explain! 




 Awesome collection! They must be worth quite a lot by now. 




 Actually, I really quite like it. It's almost like that idea is a minimalism in itself.  









 You are very talented 




 Yeah it does have some unexpected humour. 




 I am currently 3 quarters of the way through the book, I am enjoying it so far, it is a little slow but that never seems to bother me in books or movies. Most of what's happening in the book seems to be build up, does it pay off in a big epic awesome way? Without spoiling anything, is the ending satisfying? What do you guys think of the book overall?  




 I am happy that he mentioned that infinity war part 1 and 2 will be separate stand alone films, instead of cliffhanger bullshit they pull nowadays.  




 I read that wrong. I read 'Stephen King to adapt Dark Tower series for Sony'.

:( 









 'It' is my fav, is the stand better than that? 




 hahahaha thats Vampires kiss
