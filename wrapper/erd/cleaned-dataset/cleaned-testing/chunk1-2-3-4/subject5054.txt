 I would think the opposite as soft boiled are generally 'softer', also main concern was the egg white not being strong enough and just breaking when you press.  




 No offense but I'm sure the people who are working on this are a tad bit more knowledgeable than you.  Yeah, obviously there are hurtles, if there weren't any it would be imminent and not 10 years down the road (projected). You people always pop up, "well... established knowledge dictates that this is impossible, therefore any advancement is not possible." Or maybe you're not one of those.  




 So you don't know? 




 Stupid tax. I can understand an old trusting grandma falling for this but like, how do you get suckered into buying something from some random person who pulled up next to you and who wont let you even view the product? I'm a pretty trusting person but errp

 I really don't enjoy riding a bike in Houston. It's fine in neighborhoods and less busy side streets but I just feel extremely vulnerable on a bike with cars (driven by Houstonians) approaching from my blind spot (see: I don't have eyes in the back of my head). I walk anywhere 2 miles or less (walking is under valued in today's society) and taxi anything between 2 and 5 miles, which covers most of my territory.  




 Do those bigger buses have wifi? That's one thing I wish the normal buses had. Netflix just eats at my data cap too quick when I'm not on wifi.  




 I fucking love the light rail. Instead of driving to work, I started commuting via bus and rail. Takes a bit longer (30 mins in morning up from 15-20, 45 in the afternoon up from 30) but god damn are my stress levels way way down. I don't call grandma a cunt for driving too slow or get stressed out when I miss a light. It seriously has improved my life in many ways. I'd recommend it for anyone who can, and hope that with the current surge of centralized population growth, the demand and need will be in place for valuable expansion.

Having a car is nice, not relying on a car is much nicer.  




 I can't forgive you. 




 Was talking about the first player mentioned, Reggie Bush - played for USC. It's the white and red #5 jersey on the left.
 




 I'm worried about how little ass I'll have after seeing him in 5 days.  




 I'll be seeing him at Coachella this weekend! Can't fucking wait. 
 









 People who like college sports? I dunno. 




 Maybe in college, which the jersey is from. 




 No they don't. I get them on average within 10-15 minutes on the weekends. Have never waited an hour. Montrose/Heights/Midtown area. 




 The difference between Mario Williams and Clowney, is that Mario Williams didn't have the best defensive lineman in the league taking pressure off of him in his first season. 




 It's pretty irrelevant man. They're the 16th best team in a 16 team playoff. 




 "Huge playoff push" - yeah, for the 8th seed in the East. They're one and done in the playoffs. That's pretty irrelevant. 




 Well this was an imgur album which didn't have your blog accompanying it. Just going through the pictures in the album, all you get is the burger name and the episode it's from.

 It was actually a law passed before the rise of childhood obesity in America. And it really has nothing to do with Kinder eggs, it was a law designed to ban the use of non-food stuffs inside of food products, pretty sure less to do with choking hazard and more to do with contamination.

 In my shoddy attempt at defense, I was drunk last night when I made that comment.

What my mother hears: "Spouting racist rhetoric while inviting murder"

:D 




 My mum was convinced I *would* get raped *just because I moved to NYC*. Not for going out and partying every night, but for living in a city.

While I agree that is valid for a parent to worry about their child's safety, I think it's outlandish to be convinced that you would get raped just because you moved to NYC. That's pretty outlandish, no? Just as a numbers game, the rate of rape per 100,000 people in NYC is 14, while the rate of rape per 100,000 in the US as a whole is almost twice that at 26.9. As far as cities go, NYC is one of the (if not the?) safest, at least in the US. So while it might be *less safe* than where you originate (I'm picturing the town from Hot Fuzz), it's not like you're living in Cairo or Mumbai. If that were the case, I don't think it would be quite so outlandish.

So yeah, we agree, moms worry, it's not wrong for them to worry, I just think the comment I quoted was outlandish.

People worry about a lot of outlandish things, it doesn't mean they're wrong, it just means they worry about unlikely scenarios which they have no control over.

Smells like you have an alcohol problem.

 I don't think you know what "irresponsible"

I think it's irresponsible for you to assume that someone with a fairly obvious grasp of the English language doesn't know what a basic word like irresponsible means.

 No Harden is a plus doe! 




 While I completely agree he's acting unprofessionally, he can't just "go to another team". He's under contract for 3 years - a non cap friendly contract - so it's unlikely he goes anywhere.

My guess is he's getting bad advice from his uncle again. Really really bad advice.

Stop being a baby Andre, you signed a contract, honor it. 




 Oh piss off. There has always been editorial news and 'real' news. Not advocating Fox and Friends but it's not supposed to be a 'real' news show. It's full of human interest pieces and editorialized content.

 Come off it man, I was just joking. 




 One of many things that make him so endearing.

I love that he doesn't sound like an actual black person and I can relate to him on a 'normal' level. 




 As a spider, I couldn't agree more.  




 He didn't run a third time because he ran for President of the United States, which he was also elected to twice. 




 He's under contract (not a cap friendly one either) for the next 3 years. Don't expect his situation to change.

 I don't think the connection really fits. One of his big character traits is the whole coming from nothing thus fueling his ambition for power shtick.

 Dude! Mo Williams! 




 Keep the canisters to put junk in and throw away the flimsy boxes. I fill mine with bottle caps. 




 It's actually called a string bet but yeah. 




 That would require coaching. 




 He just seemed like a genuine dude. He played with heart, tenacity and humility. He was by far my favorite player to watch outside of TMac pre-bad back.  




 The stats I saw thrown around were approximately best in the league in PNR and worst in the league in post ups. 




 I agree 100%, I just believe that his post up game has improved under Hakeem and you can see it, if anywhere, in his footwork. He is still a bit clunky at times but he definitely isn't the stone handed offensive liability that /r/nba made him out to be this summer. 




 Which is fair, but I did admit that his time in LA was an unmitigated disaster. 

Dude is busting post moves during the playoffs I didn't even know he had when he was playing for LA.

That's because he didn't have them then. He's been working very closely with Hakeem pretty much since he arrived in Houston and you can definitely see Dream's influence on Howard's post moves. Another sign of his dedication to improvement and his game. 




 "i don't see ~~color~~ flair" 




 I bought signed, game worn Carl Landry shoes a few days before he got traded. Saddest I've ever been as a rockets fan.  




 Chuck wagon! One of my favorite ex-rockets. Dude was a brick house and he had the most entertaining fts.  




 It really sucks when people hate you just because of your flair and your comments are automatically viewed through a filter that no matter how poignant or accurate they are, they're already wrong.  




 There's a huge difference between not supporting someone and actively disparaging him. After Howard signed with Houston, the vast majority of visible Laker fans spewed vitriol and disdain. "He's not big enough for the bright lights and pressure of LA", "he's washed up anyways good riddance", "he doesn't try what a fake superstar", "worse at offense than thabeet". Obviously I don't believe this represents Lakers fans as a whole but the vitriol usually trumps realism in environments like this and that vitriol rose to the top.

I don't blame you for not supporting him. His time in LA was an unmitigated disaster and then he left.

Still, reasonably discussing Howard as a player and a person was next to impossible for a few weeks/months after we acquired him.

/r/nba was sure he was done, was sure his offensive game was on par with Asik, was convinced he was lazy, sure he was a chemistry killer, etc. etc.  




 Yeah how dare I be frustrated that this sub has a persecution complex for the rockets. Seeing nothing but negative post after condemning post gets pretty old pretty fast. 

also logic? What? The average casual fan aka the majority of fans have a positive view of Lin. He's polarizing in places like sports forums because of his erratic play. Vitriol will bleed through logic every time in environments like this.  




 I think there's a difference when you're trying to imply that the Toyota Center went into a collective and orchestrated booing of Lin (which didn't happen), versus a few knuckleheads booing Lin (which could have plausibly happened).

The average casual fan in Houston likes Jeremy Lin, honestly probably more than Harden. Harden gets shit on a lot. I don't understand this perception that he escapes scrutiny while Lin is selectively and constantly dragged under the bus.

But hey, whatever can rile up the most /r/nba-heads to the side of 'not houston'.

 




 A targ bastard repopulating the others? A song of ice and fire. Crastor for AA confirmed.  




 poe's law up in here 




 There is a difference between a collection of knuckleheads booing jeremy lin and the arena booing him. In this case, I'm sure there were a few people in the stands booing Lin directly, however the majority of the boos that people are referring to were directed at a combination of Mo Williams checking in and a bad (not bad) call being replayed on the screen.

I just love how this completely unsubstantiated bullshit has leaked into every fucking thread that is related to the rockets. 




  I still can't understand how the fans accept Harden shooting 30% doing terrible defense all night and for an "All Star" and "1st team all NBA" player.

jesus christ the skewed perception this subreddit has of rockets fans is crazy. harden gets *so much hate* when he plays poorly, way more than lin. acting like rockets fans are happy with harden's performance is absurd. 

i personally think he is playing poorly but i'm not gonna execute the guy for it. he's a person. same with lin; he has played poorly much more than harden has this season yet it never changed my perception of him. he's a person, they're all young. they all have a lot of pressure on them. they don't have the best coach. etc. etc. the point is that win or lose, bad performance or good performance, i support the team and the players.

this subreddit has gotten pretty unbearable for a rockets fan who just fucking enjoys basketball for the simple fact that it's entertaining. i can't even come in here after a loss anymore; and i'm starting to realize that i shouldn't after a win either.

why does everyone have to take the fun out of sports. why can't we just leave it all on the court, accept the outcome, and talk about the game like fans instead of obsessed school girls with emotional problems? 




 it used to be an alright community. there were some solid posters who provided valuable insight. then we got yao ming and with them came what were dubbed YOF (yao only fans - basically 98% chinese people) and that kinda divided the forum and ever since then it's just a huge echo chamber of hate when bad and love when good. i go there during trade season because trade discussion is fun, but anything relating to the actual season and the actual players and the actual games is garbage.

it's kind of like how /r/nba is now. 




 not sure if serious 




 /r/nba is becoming pretty shitty. i do agree that clutch fans is a very shitty place though.

i'm starting to become extremely disillusioned by sports fans in general. they're really starting to fucking bother me. no one can just chill. no one can accept a bad performance. no one can take a step back and look at it all from a wide angle perspective. it's gross honestly.  




  It's like, if Lin makes one bad play, he's shit, yet Harden can make ten bad plays in a quarter and he's just having an off night.

it's ok man, you guys do enough hating on harden already, we're just balancing it out.

also you aren't paying attention too much because people are pretty polar extreme about harden whichever way he is playing.

i was at the first game, it was the 2nd quarter, i went to the bathroom and a guy next to me was talking to his buddy about how shit harden was.

this was the first game and the first half wasn't even over.

you just have a filtered version of reality that support a narrative you want to see. 




  that comes with love and hate.

i disagree. i don't see any reason or benefit to bringing hate into the equation. sure i'll be disappointed if we lose, and i'll be disappointed if harden doesn't play well or howard looks like he's playing lazy or lin does something stupid...but it's just basketball and that disappointment wont last longer than 5 minutes. I love the rockets but i'm never gonna turn that into anything other than joy. if they lose they lose and i go home and i go to sleep and i wake up the next day in the exact same situation as if they'd won.

C'est la vie 




 Rockets bad. Rockets fans bad. James Harden bad. Dwight Howard bad. Jermey Lin 'oh i like him he's only cool rocket'.

/r/nba is a joke. i remember it was like this for the heat a couple seasons ago, which is funny because a couple seasons ago the rockets were /r/nba's favorite second team. 




 I live a couple blocks away from there, gonna be interesting how it changes traffic. I just hope there is a coffee shop in there somewhere, otherwise that Starbucks across the street is gonna start getting stupid busy. 




 this sub is fucking retarded. any reason to hate the rockets and rockets fans. 




 Jesus this subreddit is ridiculous. They've played the exact same amount of games as the Rocket's have. And yeah Rockets fans were the only one's talking shit about Lin when he was playing bad basketball. And we are the only ones riding his dick now that he has played some decent (and tonight great) basketball.

The fucking difference two years makes, from /r/nba's most loveable team to /r/nba's villian number 1.

Bunch of fickle cunts.

 My eyes are open. I choose to enjoy the content that gives me joy, while effectively ignoring those which don't.

Nothing is worse than seeing a post that I enjoyed, wandering into the comments to actively discuss or read a discussion or just make a silly comment, and seeing it filled with nothing but 'repost', 'op is a faggot', 'this isn't oc', 'op is a karma whore', etc. etc.

1st, it takes any potential conversation out of play. 2nd, it's petty. People whine and whine and whine about karma whores and that OP is 'only in it for the karma' and OP 'is trying to deceive us', but they don't realize that half the content they are enjoying could suffer equal fates in their respective comment sections.

It's just bad manners frankly. It's rude. It takes away from other's experiences.

Granted, there are cases where OP has blatantly deceived the reddit populace, but unless it's for actual monetary gain, I honestly could give two shits.

Lied about your mom banging your dog? Cool, thanks for the story.

Lied about a celebrity you saw? Cool, thanks for the photo.

Lied about a place you've been? Cool, thanks for the window to a place I've never been or a reminder of a place I have.

Life's too short to get caught up in the whole 'i'm being (potentially) deceived by someone who has nothing to gain so I should let it get to me' game.

Gotta love this subreddit.  




 Portland also had to have a record setting game by LMA to get to OT and they had a few circus shots and a tip that could have gone either way in the first game. So you're not saying anything. Just typical basketball fan who can't digest more than the most recent game at a time.

 I believe diedrichs was bought buy Starbucks or went bankrupt and the manager bought that location and changed it to Dirks.

 Life of Joseph W. McVay as others have said but also check out Guerilla Maab 'Rise' - it's one of my favorite hip hop albums. Guerilla Maab was the 'rap group' he was in with Trae (the Truth) and their cousin Dougie D (currently serving life in prison I belive) before they both went solo. 




 OK that's what I figured you were saying. And I agree, we can't lose to Portugal, a tie wouldn't be ideal but at least we'd have the goal differential buffer for our game against Germany while they'd still have to beat Ghana (assuming Ghana loses to Germany). 




 Clarification, you're saying we will only be competing with Portugal to get out of the group stage, or we aren't going to be competing with Ghana because they're going to get out of the group stage for sure? 




 I don't really see how this is even a discussion. Unless for some reason he thinks we can compete with Germany for the 1 seed? Ideal outcome for the weekend - Germany wins vs. Ghana, US wins vs. Portugal. That gives both the US and Germany 6 points putting both teams through. If Ghana beats Germany and we beat Portugal then, like you said, there are 3 teams vying for 2 spots in the last game instead of 2 teams in (assuming US and Germany W). 




 Better to have 49 quarters than 2 quarters. 
 




 I don't really see how that would be all that beneficial. The more intersecting thoroughfares you have, the more 4-way stops and stop lights you need - this is bad.

I think the solution will be more 'science' than 'structure'. Mandated staggered business hours to lighten the rush that is rush hour, better light timing, emphasis on, implantation of and general acceptance and use of quality mass transit, better pedestrian options, better driving culture, the rise of driverless cars, etc.

Many small, subtle changes can add up to very noticeable gains. 

 Of course, it would require us to sacrifice certain quaint values about quiet, empty suburban streets, but oh well. This is Houston. The city proper. If you want quiet suburban streets, move to Katy.

And no, I don't want to sacrifice the small amount of pedestrian friendly areas for something that there is no basis or evidence that it works. (unless there is which I'd be interested in reading)

Buy up houses that are in the way via eminent domain, bulldoze them, and build connections in there place. This would help immensely with traffic at a fraction of the price of building new highways.

Easy to say until your house is on the chopping block. Also, this would not be cheap. Imminent domain acquisition is expensive and time consuming. Roads aren't cheap. Bridges aren't cheap. Restructuring intersections (where do we add stop lights? where do we add stop signs? where do we create 4 way stops?) to take on the added weight of new thoroughfare traffic can't be easy.

 A couple decades was the amount of time it took to go from the first production of the V2 rocket to the first man in orbit. 20 years is a long time.

To act like it's unfeasible is just pessimistic shortsightedness. Obviously it's arrogance to think that it *will happen* because *America*, but it's nothing more than optimism to hope for it to happen.

 Why? He's from Canada, but has a tattoo representing his love for the city. He reps us hard. He considers us his second home. He loves Houston and considers himself a "Houston-mentored rapper". You should love the fact that someone with the pull of Drake reps so hard for a town he has no roots in. He gives us more national exposure than most of our homegrown guys (Bun B excluded - DJ Screw is legend status but outside of Houston and HH he is non-existent - Mike Jones was a cruel joke - Z-Ro, KeKe, ESG, wreckshop family, etc. all have in-state pull but that's about it).

Happy Delayed Drake Day! 




 He still graduated high school. It's on his transcript. They just aren't giving him the piece of paper that says he's a graduate of their school, but he is. A job/internship/school isn't going to ask to see your diploma ever.  




 I think FIFA has 3-4 backup countries that can host on the fly. USA, England, Germany, maybe France. It's a lot more than just stadiums.

 :p truth

 




 Nah no typo. Just rains more during rainy season but rains year round.  




 Nah, it really only rains for an hour max every day. Rest of the time it's blue skies and white clouds. So basically really concentrated verse England just being gloomy and wetish all the time. 

Really great weather. I actually lived in the town Nat Geo claimed best weather in the world in like 1990 or something.

 I don't really support it; I can't support it seeing as how I'm not a constituent of Louisiana. I'm just trying to rationalize it. Every issue deserves more than one point of view. It's important to see something you don't agree with and try to rationalize it without your opinions in view.

But I'm a bitch and a fool so what do I know. 




 with 16 what? 




 It's not a shock if you ever lived there. There are two seasons, rainy season and non-rainy season. It rains every day during non-rainy season.

It's nice rain though, usually in the afternoon, usually pretty hard for maybe an hour or so.

Laying under your tin roof during one of those rain storms is just the perfect nap time. Then the sun comes out, and the weather is perfect the rest of the time. 




 Which is odd because I'm pretty sure Mexico took the obesity crown from us a few years ago.

 There's a hilarious bit in the new HBO show Silicon Valley, centered around Burger King and Cicadas. Highly recommend the show. 




 Mine was off by default. I also rarely see spotify updates from other people on Facebook, so I'm guessing that's true across the board.

 I fucking dare you to actually read the bill and not base your response off of a title/horribly editorialized article. 

C'mon bitch, I dare you. Do it.  




 Maybe in response to the bonanza of 'loss of income' claims levied after deep water, which BP was pretty much just accepting without any actual trial. This concentrates the judicial power of the state into one entity. Now the small municipality who sees a cash cow can't just file a lawsuit and pad it's pockets.

I think the bit about any monies received must be used for wetlands protection supports this.

Anyways, truth probably lies somewhere in the middle and once again a lot of people are gonna be wholly misinformed because OP is wholly misinformed.

 I mean, I get that, but like, being official is pretty important for a lot of things. 




 That's his point?

Klinnsman was hired on his credentials. Klinnsman slams Kobe for being extended on his credentials. Wilbon slams Klinnsman for hypocrisy.  




 That was his point though. He got a contract to be coach based on his past actions, then he went and criticized Kobe Bryant for getting a contract based on his past actions.

He conveyed the point with absolutely no tact but I think that was what he was saying. 




 Michael Wilbon is a sports writer too. 




 He's an American but he isn't a citizen?  




 If you're not first, you're last. 




 They were tied, Ronaldo scored shortly after this in stoppage time.

Then he got fired.

Worth it? 




 Be worse at FIFA bro 




 If I remember correctly Ronaldo promptly scored after this. Pretty sure it was in stoppage time or close to 90 minutes.

So no, probably not worth it. They lost, he lost his job, he probably fired up Ronaldo which resulted in the goal.

 She is probably my least favorite casting on the show so far. I think the actress who played Ros would have been absolutely perfect for Shae and would have been a much better match personality wise with Tyrion. In that universe I wouldn't mind her taking the place of Penny. Gonna be interesting casting Penny though, are there any female dwarf actresses? 




 Huh. I'm sorry, were you expecting resolution in book 5 of, a minimum, 7 book series?

 "I don't spend..."

I probably spend an hour a day on the internet these days.

 




 Smurflogik, internet historian. 




 i did make an edit to amend my comment to not include smurflogik.

i could go into a majority of comment sections for posts on the front page, paste that onto one of the repost comments and it would be relevant. 




 Cool, did you like your new house? 




 you have an exceptional memory, i must admit 




 yeah see edit 




 How do you remember the exact year you saw that? You sure it wasn't 2002 or 2006? 




 See man, that's what you people just don't fucking get. I don't spend 15 hours a day on the internet but I see my fair share, and I've managed to never see this. You might have seen it 15 times, but this was my first.

Sometimes shit just slips through the cracks and you miss something. The simple enormity of the internet and all the content within is impossible for a single person to completely digest in *their lifetime* let alone the relative short amount of time that the internet has been churning out this content.

With that in mind, try to visualize all the stuff that you see for the first time that someone else has seen 15 times. Imagine trying to talk about it and the conversation revolves around the fact that it's "*a fuckin repost man*"

It's annoying. If you have seen something a billion times, what force drives you to go into the comments to let people know that you've seen it before?

I just picture you people in the real world, listening to someone tell a story that you'd already heard before.

"So there I was, sitting on the bench minding my own business when out of nowhe..."

"Dude, wtf, repost! you told this story already."

"Oh ya I did tell you! Sorry mate, but Patricia here hasn't heard it so I'm gonna keep going."

"Fuck Patricia, provide new content and stop being such a story whore"

"Fine... So there I was, sitting on the camel, minding my own busine..."

Patricia speaks up, "I've heard this, one stop telling it!"

e: i mean you're pretty chill about it but damn it's annoying when people act like they're above the repost

 




 Yeah when I was talking about vicinity to the light rail I meant Midtown. I do walk from the rail to my apt in montrose (Westheimer and Montrose abouts) every day after work and I don't think it's far (though it's starting to turn into a sweaty walk). I walk wayyyyy more than the average Houstonian to be fair.

There are a few bus routes that will take you there a lot quicker but I prefer the walk after work; gets my blood pumping a little. 




 Midtown sounds ideal, shouldn't be too difficult to find a place for $1,000, though might be a little more for the "perfect" spot. There are plenty of places that are pet friendly, but be prepared to pay an extra deposit for large breed. Midtown's population is predominantly young business types between 24-35, has quality night life, is about as central as you can get, it's close to downtown and the light rail (though fairly limited use depending on where your office is located).

Might also want to check out Montrose, there's a ton of large complexes going up and being finished right now. Montrose is just south of Midtown for an idea of the area.

The place you have in your post is pretty much right in between the two (Saint Danes is a great bar if you end up there - only a couple blocks away - and they're dog friendly).

 That was much closer in history than a hundred years ago. Our average precipitation is still 48" and we average over 100 days of rainfall per year.

The past 4-5 years of dry have jogged the memory a bit I think.
 




 I'll tell someone I like their new Nikes - like Mikes - though that is traditionally reserved for 'street/urban shoes' such as AF1s, Air Max's, Dunks, etc. etc.. But for the most part yeah it's Nike like Mikey.

Nikes like Mikes is pretty much only for sneakerhead type shoes. 









 Sorry but that HEB is not only a better grocery store, but also a much better looking building and space. Love that they kept the big oak tree up in the parking lot. The high rise that's going up where fiesta once stood... now that is another matter.

Not really sure what would satisfy you if you can't find a bar in montrose that caters to your type of people. Yuppie bars, bro bars, hipster bars, gay bars, dive bars, cocktail bars, etc. etc., pick your poison. Also still an abundance of smaller retail outlets (which are seemingly popping up faster than your chains).

 




 But that's only because it's big... Per capita is not an important metric when talking about immigration. You can't say, "if Germany had the same population as the US, it's immigration numbers would reflect that increase".

 Like a social net to fall on once you hit the streets. I know life can be extremely difficult for felons outside of jail (US), from getting jobs to finding a place to live. I'd like to see the differences between Euro countries and the US in this because I'm guessing that has a lot to do with ire-offending rates. 

I also think a big problem is the cultural stigma attached to felons outside of prison. Someone does 4 years and gets out but never loses that tag that makes him different.  




 This was a great post until the last bit where you went completely over-the-top-smug.

I agree that prison is for rehabilitation but it is also a fucking punishment for the crime/s you've committed. While I 100% agree drugs should never land you in prison, and jay walking shouldn't throw you in jail; there need to be appropriate consequences for people's actions. This man raped, drugged and murdered at least one girl. He was a doctor who was in a position of extreme trust. He drugged other people so that he could rape in peace. He hid from society (at least French society) to avoid punishment.

All I'm saying is some people absolutely deserve the attention and humane treatment that fosters rehabilitation; some people deserve to sit in a jail for the rest of their lives and be reminded that being a member of society is something for people who don't rape and murder kids. 

Also correlation/causation all that.  




 Quite a bit more than that bud.  




 I like how one minute she says "we're about to three-pear(lol) and the next sentence she tells him to move to Vegas to become a psychic because that's all he's doing."

 He was a rocket a couple seasons ago, we're familiar with him :) 




 I'm pretty level headed and I get downvoted for innocuous posts enough for it to be slightly grating on my nerves. Just seems like a different set of rules are applied to Rockets flair than others. Been subbed here 3+ years, have seen a huge shift in general attitude towards us. Gotten to the point where I don't come here after negative Houston things because the hate train is so strong. Oh well.  




 I've stayed pretty far away from here :p 




 I agree with the first statement. Good pick up, overpaying him made sense as Dirks window is closing, just like it would have made sense for us if Bosh signed here. Think the Mavs will be pretty good this year (3-5 seed) 




 Frankly, my impression has been that Houston talks more shit about Dallas.

That's my impression as well and I've lived in Houston for 24 years out of a possible 26. 




 Right thought, wrong flair. 




 What's true? 




 No worries, it's mutual :p

Though I'd take you over a Mavs fan. 




 Been anti rockets for a while now. Kind of annoying.  




 Been hating the rockets for about a year and a half really. Ever since the Harden honeymoon was over.  




 Makes sense and I know he loves Houston. Even though apparently we treat all our players like shit now.  




 Remember his post draft interview? Golden.  




 Forgot about Ariza, thought you were calling TJones above average defender.  




 He butted heads with Adelman, got traded and I think he's playing overseas now. 

He was spectacular against LA though. 




 His post draft interview was spectacular (Rockets originally drafted him). He was so so so raw when he first got in the league though. Ended up playing 2 minutes per game w/ us for one season. 

Still a memorable player to me just because of his interview though. 

E: lol jk thought I was in the Joey Dorsey thread  




 see: flair 




 welcome to the life of a rocket fan on /r/nba.

subscribed here for 3.5 years. crazy how different rocket flair is seen from just 2 years ago. 




 Confidence is unwavering I feel like. Cockiness comes and goes.  




 When did I say that? We didn't have any players worth being franchise loyal to before Harden and Howard. Can you really blame the FO for not matching Parsons once Bosh was out of the equation? He'd would have been making more than harden. The Rockets would have had zero flexibility moving forward with a team that didn't make it out of the first round last season. 

I'll admit our roster has been a revolving door since Yao went down but franchise players don't just fall into your lap. Howard was obviously comfortable enough with the FO to take less over resigning with the Lakers.  /r/nba just has on shit colored spectacles when it comes to the rockets. 




 No, it counts towards luxury tax just not the cap. That why the NBA has a soft cap. Les would absolutely have been paying luxury tax.  




 See his comments last night? Doesn't appear so.  




 Asik didn't want to be in Houston. Do people not remember that? He was trying to move Asik to a team where he could play more and we wouldn't have such a redundant player. Did people really forget the whole Asik basically saying "trade me" after we signed Howard? 




 I'm sorry but how were Asik and Parsons treated poorly exactly? 




 Roy Hibbert? 




 Like shit? How was Parsons treated like shit? How was Asik treated like shit? Besides the jersey thing, which could have easily just been a marketing team's really dumb error, how was Lin treated like shit?

Parsons - we would have given him 15 million per and gone over the salary cap had Bosh chose Houston

Asik - besides giving him a contract most people scoffed at (including r/nba), we tried to trade him until the trade deadline last season after acquiring Howard. What else do you want? Teams to not get a significantly better player at the position you already have a guy at?

Lin - gave him a team to run and be the focal point of. Just happened to pick up a much better player later that offseason. Their skill sets overlapped.

You people seem to think that this is a church peewee league or something.  




 How was Asik disrespected? 




 You realize just last year we made a major free agent signing with Howard right? And the year before Harden happily signed our extension. We haven't had anyone to be loyal to since Yao faced premature retirement. Which player has the Rockets had in the past 6 years who deserved the kind of loyalty that Duncan, Dirk, Kobe, etc. got?

 




 It's a fucking organization worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In what universe are you expecting them to "be nice". Yeah, they didn't roll out the red carpet like a superstar for the guy, but he was treated extremely well while he was here and conversely he treated us extremely well. Had we signed Bosh, he would have been rewarded directly by us with an instant match of his offer sheet (which would have cost owner Les Alexander a tremendous amount of luxury tax). As it turns out he was rewarded, just by a team up interstate 45. 

What more do you want them to do? Be nicer? Jesus, this isn't Sunday school.  




 And we tried pretty fucking hard to trade Asik before the trade deadline. Fuck Morey for snagging the #1-2 center in the league, right? How else were we supposed to treat the guy? "Well Asik, we have a chance to sign Dwight Howard but we gave you a 3 year deal so we're stickin with you big guy!"

Give me a break guys, this is a cut throat business. 

E: also a funny point is that the reason it was so hard to move him last year was because of HIS FUCKING EXPENSIVE CONTRACT MOST TEAMS DIDNT WANT TO TOUCH! 




 They drafted him, gave him a starting role for 3 years where he has able to build up his product(him) to be worth 15 million dollars per year. By opting out of his 4th year option *they* created his market. Perfect storm for Chandler, desperate Cuban for a huge FA Signing.

So I'd say they did a little bit for him....  




 He could be the 3rd star if the first two were LeBron James and LeBron James.  




 He's done it 3 other times and matched instantly each time until now.  




 Our comparable Dirk would have been Yao. Yao's career ended prematurely. Sorry we weren't nicer to him so he'd stay injury free. You have to have that special player first before you can't treat them well. And I guess to get to that discount we have to overpay for him first (by the way think it's a good contract for y'all as Dirk's widow is small - but a bad contract for us). So while I think y'all are overpaying for him, it makes sense, like it would have made sense for us to overpay him if we had signed Bosh.  




 and the mods allow for all sorts of opinions. good community too.

thumbs up emoji 




 Fair enough, can't say I stuck my head into that area very much, or at all. I generally don't like 'fandom' or the entitled culture which surrounds a large population of sports observers/fans. Like, you (not *you* - the proverbial you) watch 3 fucking games a week, fuck off with your (not *your* - the proverbial your) self centered metric of success and constant diversion between throwing players under the bus when performing poorly and hand jobs when good abounds.
 




 I really like the writers on the Rockets blog 'The Dream Shake'. Good basketball analysis mixed with (from what I see) fair shakes at the players. 




 lol funny you said that. just spent like 15 minutes writing this up.

http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2agal2/lin_traded_to_the_lakers/ciusr4i

to answer your question: no, I stopped going to the forums a few years ago. 




 Yeah it's a pretty shitty forum. bsk4 must not have been going there for a long time. The whole contingent of 'player only fans' started with Yao when half of the posters were Chinese fans who only gave a shit about Yao and not the Rockets. Even before that though you had the old guard who would do nothing but compare the current squad to the championship era of Hakeem - dubbed 99ers (because they were original members when the board was founded in 99 - fun fact: i got banned from clutch fans about 5 years ago for telling Tinman (like The King of 99ers), to gobble on some dicks and stop talking the "good old days" so much). Honestly though, 'player/era only fans' aren't even the worst part. It's very knee-jerk, players (and coaches) get thrown under the bus constantly and are swiftly pulled out and kissed on the forehead when they play up to the expectations of entitled observers. Fickle, unintelligent posters abound, caution.

To be fair, there are a few posters there who are extremely solid and possess impressive basketball minds (DaDakota, Big Moe, HayesFan to name a few who stick out), unfortunately they get drowned out by what you're talking about. 




 I really did not see that much hate against him from Houston fans this past season. Apparently I missed it?

Always seemed like Harden took the brunt of the hate train when things weren't going as peachy as entitled fans thought they should be. 




 Houston is also just in general a huge market.  




 Crazy how much that trade nix changed the landscape of the NBA in the 2010s.
 




 Poor DWade. Opted out of his 22 million dollar contract hoping LeBron would stick around. Now he'll be lucky to get 12. 




 **11** letters - 9/**11**

1+1 = 2. 2 Names. Dick Cheney.  




 Yet people act like him being benched for Beverly was some personal slight against Lin. 'Basketball reasons' is actually athing. 




 Wait, what? My jimmies looked rustled from my comment? I had a smile on my face after getting eliminated from the playoffs this year because basketball is cool and fun and getting stressed or angry over it is silly. 




 This makes me so happy. This is like, better than an ice cold topo chico on a hot summer day. 




 People act like the Melo thing was Les and Morey getting together and being like, "Lets show how little we care about Lin". While it was much more likely something like the Rockets design team making a innocent mistake. 




 Getting benched for a player who better suited the starting lineup is getting treated like shit? I didn't see the hate towards Lin that a lot of people on this board talk about. The jersey thing was tasteless but it could have been something as innocent as the design team not thinking the whole concept through, not a deliberate shot at him.
 




 Yeah I don't remember the exact details except that the contracts were dubbed "Poison Pill Contracts".  




 That is the cap hit against Houston. Pretty sure it's the full 15 million for any other team. Could be mistaken though and maybe the 15 million cap hit was only been if the Knicks matched. 




 I've been on reddit for almost 4 years and I think your comment is like the 5th I've upvoted, so kudos on that.   




 just picturing you literally sitting on your computer incubating your comment until the right time. 




 Wrong Chandler

AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT! 




 Know what else wouldn't be fair? If Cleveland cloned LeBron 10 times and then bombed an orphanage.

Or if an elephant sat on the last bowl of ice cream.
 




 And Bosh just swishin 12-15 footers all day erry day. Bosh is such an obscene upgrade for our PNR defense alone. Jones was absolutely garbage in that capacity. His team D was atrocious.  




 Chandler is coming to Houston in this scenario though (i.e. the SW being the Rockets division to lose by getting Bosh and resigning Parsons). 




 Wait what? That is such a sleek Spurs move. You just won a championship, now you are tricking the Mavericks into joining your cause by making them think the Rockets are more of a threat to win it all than y'all.

Sly. Very sly. And that's why the Spurs are the best. 




 Honestly thought it was too big, still do for any team that couldn't go over the cap to sign him.

 




 And trying is half the battle! 




 win/win 




 Right but the reward is still the same. The reward in both scenarios is Parsons. The likelihood of retaining the reward simply increases the larger the contract is. Same reward - Parsons - either way.  




 You'll never hear me defend Kevin McHale as a good coach, bruh. 




 I know it doesn't mean shit, I was comparing two meaningless sets of statistics. 




 Do you seriously think the Rockets would have beaten the Spurs

I never said that, but Dallas didn't beat the Spurs either.

The argument was that Dallas played good against the champs, so did the Rockets. The Rockets didn't have to play against the champs in the first round because they played better than the Mavs during the regular season. See how dumb all these arguments are? 




 The more they offer doesn't increase the size of the reward, just the likelihood that they'll get to keep the reward. Same reward either way.  




 If you change the 16 years to 26 years our historical perspective looks better than y'all's. What's your point? 




 I'm sure players measure historical precedent when they're deciding whether or not to join a team with the mission of winning a championship.

Pack it up everyone, the Mavs have reached the 2nd round more often than the Rockets over the last 15 years, clearly they're the superior horse to ride going forward.   




 And the Rockets swept the champs in the reg. season.  




 Oh shit...my mistake.  




 Lol was just being silly. My error! 




 I read it as *will take* at first and was like argh ! ! !  




 thought you said it wouldn't matter without them 




 Uh no, I'm saying they wouldn't have won them without Odom, Pau and Co.

e: i misread you i guess? 




 It's not at all true.  




 So is Macintosh Plus just another name she goes by? All the albums on that page are Vektroid even when they have another artist name on the bandcamp linked pages?

My music library needs to know for uniformity sake. 




 To be this is one of the most evenly matches knockout games so far besides CR and Greece.  




 Nothing to lose? How about a chance to play in another World Cup game?

I highly doubt the team is sitting around going "whelp we made it this far, let's just cut loose cuz we got nothin to lose." 




 Disagreed 




 I got some serious asperger vibes from this post. 

"My mom wasn't there to introduce us" - as a 20 year 




 See, regardless of whether he ends up a Rocket next season or not is irrelevant. This is Morey 101, if he feels that Parson's is being overvalued by the market, he wipes his hands and wishes the player good luck. If the market dictates a price that Morey feels is not only within his valuation but also fits with his 'grand plan', he'll have a new contract waiting for Parsons before he gets on the plane.  




 Everyone's loyal until they aren't. I could see him giving a small discount (-10% max), but he's only been here 3 years, has no historical ties to the area, and he already helped us out big time in getting Howard (and just in general by being the best value in the NBA during his contract). Hope he gets whatever he deserves.   




 That or she doesn't remember what attractive is.  




 I enjoyed this. It gets a little slow on the back end of some of the lyrical verses at times but otherwise good stuff.  




 Ouch. I can see this on a late night monologue soon.  




 Agreed, instead of talking about basketball let's not talk about basketball. 

So how about that Elon Musk? Cool chap, aye?
 




 y'all are cute 




 "karma" 




 satire? 




 teehehehehehehhee 




 While I agree the fans are better, it's definitely not more entertaining. Collegiate football is not nearly on the same skill level as the NFL, it's like saying you'd rather have an architecture student design your house because 'they're more passionate'.

The difference between the NBA and NCAAB is even bigger. 




 Suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the ride. You honestly have no way of actually knowing if something happened or not, so why get bent up with negative feelings that someone is "tricking you" for "karma"? 




 You take reddit way too seriously. 




 Therefore, they're all lies. 




 Thanks for letting us all know what is funny and what isn't funny, arbitrator of comedy. 




 he has said all the right things 

not that I disagree, but saying and doing are two very different things. he had the reputation for a reason. 




 No he signed an extension after the playoffs.  




 Bosh would have to take a min contract for that to work out.  




 Gotta beat them for a ring either way.  




 Really happy for Costa Rica. Spent one of the best years of my life living there during my senior year of high school (which incidentally was the last time y'all made it to the world cup - 2006). Unfortunately y'all didn't do as well then as you are doing now (think y'all went 0-3?).

Buena suerte Costa Rica!
