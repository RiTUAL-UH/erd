 I could have even made weakness potions, but time and the game were not on my side...
 




 I could have even made weakness potions, but time and the game were not on my side...
 




 lol, Ice, there is no July 32nd :D
 




 Does it close and reopen 20 minutes before?

 




 Well, tbh, if he said not to use the command, then don't use it, and don't be that guy... 




 Actually at the time I am typing this, it is 17:35. 




 It will be quite a treat seeing all the new faces we may see during and after this event! Just remember, always be respectful to the host, and never cheat! 




 Make sure you don't have ./nick enabled, that allows people to change their name and causes problems. 




 :(
 




 Be there once more, hopefully better this time!

 




 Be there again, and no babies! 




 I only had like 9 :D 




 Although I didn't win, I'll have you know I also had a power 3, and died because you didn't have more arrows! :( 




 }:) 




 I've trucked through the only matches I've played of it, but through all of them, I have learned that baby zombies need to hit less as hard and have less health. Right now they are basically small, fast zombies, and any health I lose is to them. 




 Ice, have I ever told you how much I love your games? Because I do! Although, if this is the last 1.5.2 match, I may lose my always going to meetup and dieing streak, because baby zombies. 




 Maybe Ice will host? That be awesome! :D
 




 That doesn't seem right though, it says the 21st for blackie's?
 




 mwahahahahaha 




 I'll (try to) be there! 




 Your not alone, I did too :'(
 




 Or not :( 




 :D
 




 I'll be there again! 




 I thank him too, I wonder when there will be a game without us in it, or one with Jacob in it. 




 Earlier today huh, I'll still be there though!
 




 I'll get you this time! 




 Yeah, I had similar gear as shadowlego, and 5 golden apples (+ full health) and was against the wall, but then someone attacked with what I assumed was a strength potion or a really good sword, while 3 others were   charging at me, and died in one hit. I didn't even get to heal due to as many people as there were. 




 I would recommend next time, just ban him. Don't make a long lengthy deal over it, it makes the game worse. Better luck next time! 




 To those who would want to play in these matches, I would recommend not to. The OPs were spawning mobs to get rid of particular players, and down right annoy others. I had about 20 bats spawned on me on one occasion. Other players (regardless of who they were) had creepers spawned on them. I would not recommend playing these matches until their games are fair, and tolerant. 




 I am sorry, but that seems like the, "If it doesn't impact me, then i don't care about it." or basically, you don't care about anyone but yourself. I'm sorry if I offended you, but its my opinion. 




 okay, sure i see, but how many people dont use that chat, or want to organize all their information? It gets a bit hectic to do it in chat. There are also many that arnt in that chat that want to play games, and get their games from the subreddit. Believe it or not, but a lot of people DON'T use the skype chat. 




 Not to be rude, but, where else is there? 




 Those who are trusted by the host, not all, I understand you, but there are those who would not play fairly, however, I don't see them often or at all. Many on the UBL though do play fairly. I personally want to stay out of this one, but just clearing that up. 




 I assume that he meant 22:30 UTC or 6:30 EDT because PDT is strange to use without EDT unless you live there. (Also, JOHNNY, UTC from PDT is +7) 




 You didnt put the IP in the post guy, whata doin!?
 




 Wanting me to "shut the fuck up" when i am asking a question just shows that you cant take criticism, and i was merely asking a question for why you would say something that was not a sign of good hosting. You dont have to tell me what i already know. 




 I would love to play again, your guys server was all right with 15 people, so you shouldnt have a problem with 25. (Also, I like endurance ffa's, the ones with no time limit, hint hint nudge nudge.) 




 Was fun! Started as the first one to take damage, and went on to win! 




 It didn't matter who said it, i was merely asking why it said that, when that obviously is not a sign of good hosting. Replying "shut the fuck up" also is not, and was completely uncalled for, I replied back as narrow minded as you did. I'm not the only one that had a problem with your matches, or this being the first, and I'm sure, not the last, you may want to learn to respect people before they will respect you, and don't go "you swore at me, nyanya" While it may not have been one of the most mature things I've done, you swore at me first, and I don't "bow down" to hosts, I play with them mutually, and respect them. You, I have no respect for whatsoever.  




 Sounds like wdornbach to me, his hosting is very similar.
 




 That doesn't give much context, why did he deserve to be banned?
 




 Apparently you could have logged back in, and I had asked the host (who, contrary to what it says here, was t4t4t4t4, not actually_yes) why he had not replied, and he said he was afk. I then complained that he had said "this is an impromptu, do not complain about lag and bad hosting" and i said that gave no right to not host correctly. To that, actually_yes replied with "shut the f*ck up" and i replied back as narrow minded as he did. He then banned me for: faggot. 




 He is a very clever man, but apparently not enough, you sir brought this to light, so that we know to avoid this name too, thank you.
 




 Hopefully you will do better than he did with it. :)
 




 No no, -10/10
 




 However, curious why people were still on, I logged onto the server, to see if this was still going on, it appears that wdornbach said he had lost the server, and no longer owns it, so hopefully we wont see him anymore. 




 I would have claimed that before the point of wdornbach killing people, that he was just making honest mistakes, but at the point he just went and killed people, he was being incompetent, especially because he never replied at anything ever said in chat. He is a horrible host, no because he didn't know what he was doing, but because of the things he did know what he was doing. 




 were you still in game? can you not get on either?
 




 I am not whitelisted D:
 




 I personally think you could do well, but here is some feedback:

-Don't make PvP instantaneous, turn it off until first night or second day.
-Make the spawn box bigger and within the borders, the constant teleporting was quite annoying.

I do however, like your endgame of a re-scatter, and I would appreciate you trying again :) 




 it will be interesting to see who eats their apple at the start and who doesn't ':l.  




 I get DCed too, and now its white-listed! D:  




 Skype and IGN: test_subject5099
 




 Scenario?  




 As it says feel free to apply again, may I do that here? IGN: test_subject5099

 I know I'm a bit late, but it would be awesome to play, IGN: test_subject5099 




 I have been planning to be in everyone of your FFA's, and thwarted every time! 




 Twice and your out if a great idea, and if the person has tried to alternate account their way to play, the time should be extended as if it was a totally different person (A reset, if it were.).
 
























 You sir, are a genius! I think it is pretty balanced if so, because killing a witch is pretty difficult if it poisons you, and they are pretty rare. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/ultrahardcore/comments/1kymif/news_about_xss_9/ 




 From this comments time, it is in an hour and 30 minutes. 




 23:00 UTC
 




 Its not up D: 




 Teams of -99* :P
 




 Is the message can't resolve host name or Can't Reach server? also the "(MPMG)" part is not part of the IP. 




 You messed up more than that buddy, the format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC and this is not an impromptu... 




 Well, that's how they are, yes, they do need to be nerfed, but the host cannot do that, if he decides to disable glowstone than so be it. 




 Nether is 1.6 isn't it? 




 Does it say teams or allies? No? Then no. 




 Hopefully, all went well except that the whitelist should have been cut off at the time you got twenty, and that you should have pregened. 




 YAY :D 




 Can you give us the direct IP, the one with the numbers? 




 Hopefully you can, but "trolling" doesn't give a good impression of you as a host. 




 Fun for you and whoever kills you, we would have all been killed by that one guy, thats not fun, imo, and once again, I didn't play your game... 




 Check you chat logs dude, I only ever said the F-Bomb, I never called you a cunt, the pinata thing was out of hand though, they were never a set of stuff that automatically made you win, just boosts...
 




 You can do better, but your assistant host, cannot, he has no better judgement and should have left it as an ffa, not a "kill me and you win" game, because that gear was too op. 




 It would have been fine if you used better judgement and known that the person that killed you would have won no matter what, your hosting skills can be improved on, but the pinata thing was the worst idea I've ever heard. Almost like Gammex, and that's pretty bad. I didn't get to play anyway, you banned me... 




 DO NOT EVER PLAY THIS GUYS GAMES...
Even for his first game, this is wildly unacceptable, he did not pregen or cut off the whitelist, leading to 30 minutes of trying to kick people to lower the player count. Then, the game was changed to FFA due to issues, (which is fine), however, then the host made himself "a walking pinata" with a sharp V sword and full diamond. I said that this was F-ing Stupid, and to that, he said, that this was a "random game" when infact it was a Reddit To2, not an FFA by some nitwit, even though thats what it ended up being. Do not play in this hosts games, unless you want to waste your time. 




 Swyrnd and test_subject5099 




 Hi, my name is nether rush, and I killed 4 people in 30 seconds! 




 WOO! 




 If you didn't notice, you can log in now! 




 This usually isnt how this works out, but sometimes it just doesnt work out :/ 




 Hope you do well :D 




 Practice your pvp overall, and start with an FFA, learn the basics, maybe some tactics, and listen to what some people say in chat, because while sometimes it is really annoying things that arent relevant, sometimes it is helpful. Keep the mentality too at the start of the game, that you will only have 10 hearts, and thats it.

And remember, baby zombies will eat your face, skellies have aimbot, and that the nether is over-powered. 




 Yeah, I know, I wanted to play too :/ 




 Cmon man it says the max is 30 players :/ Please tell me you didnt start early :/ 




 You already start? It was never specified when you opened and I'd like to play :( 




 Well, it says Vanilla in the title, but No mobs and Perma-day are not Vanilla :3 




 My PC doesn't work with ips of this sort, do you have the number form of the IP?
 




 nether enabled?
 




 Not the only one man, mine was the same way. 




 Please host adc, Brindle's game is home hosted...
 




 3:15 UTC is 11:15 EDT, the server opens at 11:00 EDT  




 Nether enabled this time? 




 GG, that win was a bit cheaty, but we killed so many in the portal. Thank you swyrnd for helping me win! 




 Man, you have to pregen, otherwise it will take an eternity to start the game. 




 What about the nether? Is its terrain 1.7.3 generated? 




 If I don't have potions: 1. Pick 2. Sword 3. Bow 4. Water Bucket 5. F S 6. Lava Bucket 7. Food 8. Blocks 9. Torches or Gapples

If I have potions I just remove blocks, Lava, and F S for pots and such, and my inventory itself is put accordingly to my hotbar, like arrows above bow or tools above the pick. 




 YES, my favorite gamemode! 




 Why thank you, even if i did lose, it was a completely fair final fight, but as it seems, Strength 1 vs. 10 dogs (I had the strength) is not good if you have no lava. 




 Can we get some clarification as to what is going on with this tournament, because it seems like game 2 is not happening without any reason why. 




 Unfortunately I cannot make this particular match, but all other matches in this tournament I should be able to make :) 




 I would not recommend playing this host's games, very early in the match he started an event that caused rain to do damage, with no notification on this post that that would happen. When anyone would say anything about this, he would reply "quit yo bitchin" completely disregarding anything said. Do not play a game from this host if you wish to pvp, and not hide in caves from an event we were not notified of. 




 Should be open, Its 10 minutes before start... 




 This opens in 45 minutes from when I replied to you... 




 Yeah, it should be open, but its not... 




 Why hello there, I'm test_subject5099 (I prefer JT personally), and I've been around since May 2013. I personally love the competition, and play a lot of  FFAs, but team games are always fun (I prefer random teams games over chosen, but that's just me.). Always have fun, and remember, pots are op, and enchantments first!  




 For future reference: 4:30 UTC is actually 12:30 EDT 




 Is there a chance you would allow solos? 




 Better hope that skeleton is on the left or right side of your screen! 




 When does it open?
 




 We over at /r/ultrahardcore have a very similar idea, where we have the "Golden Head". Simply craft a golden apple but instead of the apple use a player head and heal 4 hearts! This encourages pvp and gives strategy to how much gold you should keep on your person. 




 Yeah, got second :( what is your IGN anyway?
 




 hopefully I won't die with potions this time! 




 Don't worry, I died with pots yesterday, so you should definitely be able to kill me :) 




 I will murder you all 3 




 ICEEEEEEEEEEEEE, I totally will play this :)

 




 Yes
 
























 The ability to turn all sounds except player sounds may or may not effect UHC, probably will be fine due to the fact that all people have access to it in vanilla at any time, and it is intended, but idk. 




 TBH, with their rarity, it seems fine, if you get that lucky to get one of these books, or spend the time to, then its about as balanced as spawning next to a temple, not game ending, but good. Considering too the drop of books in dungeons, it seems okay. 




 No more endurance?
 




 This is not the way to format posts, the correct format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (Title) and you must use UTC time. 




 test_subject5099 




 You sir, should just stop posting matches, this is ridiculous.
  




 Isn't Blitz FFA you start at half a heart but you have a notch apple? 




 I would move to a much more convenient position to bow fight, hopefully catching the attacker off-guard and shooting him to death. 




 I have to thank you for that, while it wasn't directly my intent, you gave the chat a more of a wake up call then myself alone could have. 




 The UHCS skype chat, as I understand it, is for us to socialize, and it has been that way for a while, but or some reason lately it is filled with uninteresting, stupid guff that most people don't want to read or care about. Myself and many others have left the chat for this reason, where we were mostly there for information about the server, the occasional conversation was fine, but it had gotten out of hand.

A long time ago when the server was smaller and there were way less people, me and MG had a very long conversation about random stuff, that we were promptly told by many to stop, which we did, and talked in a private chat.

What I'm asking is to stop all this random stuff on the chat, and bring it back to its original purpose, the way it should be and was meant to be, not some role-playing chat with random topics that mean nothing to the chat. This is a plea for order, for the way things should be, not a spam-filled chat with things you can do elsewhere. 




 I didnt say it wasn't :P just that he said call, but calls are not permitted. 




 *cough* skype is not allowed *cough* only teamspeak *cough cough* 




 basically, teamspeak would be incredibly easier because you can just switch channels. 




 The Title format MMM DD HH:MM UTC - Title and the time must be on a 24 hour clock, and the post must be made at least one hour in advance. 




 The Title format MMM DD HH:MM UTC - Title and the time must be on a 24 hour clock 




 The Title format MMM DD HH:MM UTC - Title and the time must be on a 24 hour clock, but a great idea none the less! 




 So you said you will open at 21:30, but you opened 5 minutes before that... Why? 




 I can't seem to resolve hostname.

 He put the whitelist up when it was filled, it was filled in half a second. 




 He put the whitelist up when it was filled, it was filled in half a second. 




 This post is still here though...
 




 Hey, could you remember to close your server or put up the whitelist next time, your spawn is a bit screwed up. 




 GAH 




 You could literally make an alliance of the entire server. 




 cough cough, You need to turn off whitelist, cough cough 




 97 Coal Blocks and 221 Redstone Blocks 




 First of all, your title should be in the format of MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (Information), Secondly, you should be using UTC time, not GMT, which are the same, but UTC is used here. Thirdly, the only information you have is the gametype, time, and the nether, no subrules or other paraphernalia. Please look at other posts and follow the format next time. Also, you cannot post a match less than an hour before the actual match.

 I WILL TRY HARDER. 




 Wait, what? 




 THE VERY FIRST GAME THAT THE NETHER IS BACK, YOU HOST AT A TIME I CAN'T PLAY. WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY 




 :/ 




 woo
 




 Damn guy punted me off a mountain for it though :D 




 Okay, I see, I see, I am aware too that for some reason your name was not there before, but congrats on freedom. 




 Allies cannot win together, they must kill in the end. 




 You are still on the UBL Slutty, Number 10. 




 Resource packs in general work fine with optifine, why wouldn't an xray one work? Just common logic... 




 ;_; 




 not that I'm trying to condone this or anything, or attack you, but there are xray texture packs too, which are obviously bannable, but they work with optifine...

DON'T DO IT KIDS, not even once... 




 You hosted my very first ever game, I am so sad to see you go :(
Hopefully you will do well in life, and I hope nothing horrible caused this.
...see you next time :) 




 test_subject5099, Swyrnd, Jaewoook 




 server not up? 




 because the game is tomorrow... -_- 




 Match posts must be made one hour or more in advance... 




 Not to be mean, but don't forget, if you're on the UBL, you also cannot be on the server. 




 Click the link... 




 :') I'm sure we will all miss you del, have a great time at college, the dragon rush I played with you was one of the most memorable games I ever played, and UHCS was (and is) a big deal to me :) good luck out there!

...and come back for a visit...ya hear? 




 This is true ^^^^ 




 ._. 




 No, log on at any time to play. 




 I wouldn't assume solos are allowed, are they? 




 Since this is the only activity this account has also ever had on reddit, this is almost certainly not true. Hooray for logic! 




 I win 




 Well, then allow me to go for round 3 :D 




 I posted this after the match was full, I posted it for people that didn't get into this match but still wanted to get in, but that's fine, I hate fun too. 




 You disable glowie yet? 




 Anyone that would still like to play a uhc, there is a voted match at uhc.msarchet.com:25618 




 It filled in half a second. 
























 test_subject5099
 




 It is the correct format, probably can't be parsed because it goes into next year. 




 The plugin, being from /r/ultrahardcore, I feel that the plugin is 100x better, for no ghast tears, enderpearl damage can be toggled, player heads, golden heads; with all of this, I feel makes the game a lot better and more strategic. 




 The overall format is Mmm DD HH:MM UTC - (Title) 




 The correct format for this match is Oct 06 01:30 UTC - Cheesy's #3 To3 




 Sep removes them from extreme hills and chests. 




 Match posts must be made at least an hour in advance. 




 Thanks Obama 




 I wish more kills to you, and death upon you at the same time :D 




 Next time, your post must be at least an hour in advance. 




 Whitelist isn't off.
 




 probably
 




 The correct format for this particular match is "Sep 30 18:00 UTC - dannyminez's #3 To3 Endurance (Sign Up)"
 




 test_subject5099 




 I did then lol 




 Walden, matches cannot be posted less than an hour in advance. Do not be surprised if this is taken down.  




 I was in the game :L 




 Then don't, but we really don't either. 




 He made the best out of a bad situation :D 




 Listen D4, your post is going to be removed because only mods can post goodbyes. Sorry to see you go, but rules are rules. 




 To add to this, this was 2 hours ago. However, being that it doesn't say impromptu, as much as I want it to be today, is probably tomorrow. 




 The civilization crumbles, and you walk quietly back in, and we all listen, all of us, in spirit.  




 Maybe the one that isn't an asshole.
 




 "isn't" 




 Then that is not an allies game, thats a long distance to2 with solos. 




 You can always backstab in an allies game. 




 I can't get the ip to work, can you supply the number ip? 




 Incorrect formatting, the correct format for this match is Sep 24 00:45 UTC - Awalk's To2 w/solos 




 and maybe test_subject5099? 




 test_subject5099 




 Sep 22 16:00 UTC - MCRuler10 #1, FFA (Return of Funk)***
I only assume its today. 




 Sep 22 07:00 UTC - FFA - Big Toe's Impromptu #12* :P 




 RTo5 means random teams of five, so there is no guarantee you can play with your friend. 




 Sep 22 09:00 UTC - * 




 When sessions go up everyone jumps like this and it DDOSes the servers so they time out again. 




 No golden apples or heads? 




 Sup 




 Yes, but on an even higher level, where one enters the nether or things of that nature, especially with things like enderrush. I played a few of those games though, and sometimes it helped me get gold or diamonds I wouldn't normally see right away. 




 You are able to toggle it in default minecraft I believe, but I would like to see scenarios using this functionality.  




 and a hyphen :P 




 "Date and Time: Sunday, September 16 02:00 UTC (09:00 PM EST)" 02:00 UTC is 10 EDT :P
 




 Also, how many allies? 




 Guy, the format you want to use for this particular match would be: Sep 16 20:00 UTC - DIg224#1 Vanilla FFA with Allies 




 The correct format is Mmm DD HH:MM UTC - (Title) 




 Is it FFA or To3?, it says To3 in the post. 




 I got pots (which yes, can make this completely invalid, but it was still pretty cool) and I went to 0,0 with 30 minutes left in the game, then, I see a guy, do a typical st2 2 shot, then it gets interesting. I see another guy in the desert, 2 shot him, see 2 more in the distance, run up and kill them both, turn around and kill another, and then go down into a temple to re-brew and heal. All this took less than a minute. As it turned out, there was enough diamonds left on the ground for full diamond, but I couldn't pick them up. :D (I won after 2 more kills if you didnt guess) 




 Once again, please use the correct format: Mmm DD HH:MM UTC(space)-(space)(title) 




 Announcement flair is for moderators only. 




 The format is UTC(SPACE)-(SPACE)(Title) :P xD, definitely don't delete and repost, just remember for next time. 




 As long as you know the rules, its not a problem. 




 I mean, at least the impromptus would follow the rules, they werent even posted an hour in advance. 




 See here - http://www.reddit.com/r/ultrahardcore/comments/1k53na/regarding_impromptu_and_official_matches/

No need for a mod to message you, it is against the rules, pushing your game back 15 minutes would suffice, but rules are rules, and while there may be enough players for all three, many time there are not, so please follow the rules. 




 While it is true that he does host everyday, and hosting an FFA at the same time, there should still be players, then there is no problem with holding the FFA back 15 minutes for people that want to play that, correct? Rules are Rules, even if they dont matter at one point, they do at another. 




 Games must be posted at least an hour in advance, no earlier. 




 Games must be posted at least an hour in advance, no earlier, and the correct format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (title) 




 Please use the correct format, the format is MMM DD HH:MM UTC - (title), and you may want to add some additional information, such as the nether, length of the game, and number of people.  




 The game that prompted crimson to write this was an ffa with one ally, and no backstabbing, to give some context, long distance to2 is basically that, in its entirety, for one change and one only, no teleport. 




 "Long Distance" To2 with solos and FFA with allies of 1 and no backstabbing are the exact same thing, infact, I've seen some hosts tp allies together before, there has to be a set description for these scenarios, it seems just too common that the two blend together. 




 1: No, I cannot record.
2. Anytime on the weekends or anything from 18:30 - 02:30 UTC
3. Teams, but only due to my inability to record, teaming with players who can would be beneficial. 




 Do you have an alternate ip? I cannot resolve the hostname due to the type of ip this is.
