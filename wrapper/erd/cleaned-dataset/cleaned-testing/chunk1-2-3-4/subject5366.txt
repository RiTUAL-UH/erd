 Sept. 24. Duncan's family members tell U.S. authorities this is the day he first felt sick. That is when he likely became contagious.  
 Sept. 26. Duncan seeks treatment at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas and is sent back to his sister's apartment with antibiotics.  
 Sept. 28. Duncan is transported to the same hospital by ambulance. He is critically ill and put in isolation in the hospital's intensive care unit.  
 Sept. 30. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms that Duncan has been stricken with the Ebola virus, the first patient to be diagnosed in the USA.

 Ya, you do need to do your homework, consult a lawyer, know what to negotiate, etc.  
Once they file that 1099C cancellation of debt to the IRS though, you should be in the clear. 




 These debt collectors will settle for pennies on the dollar. Maybe a few more pennies than they paid for the loan, but they'll normally be willing to negotiate before going to get a judgement. 




 Nope you shouldn't have to, as part of their jobs though they will ask.

 It depends?  
Action combat can be fun, but it can also get repetitive, tiring, and boring as well. I suppose if combat is as dangerous as it sounds, you may not be fighting something/someone every few minutes during your gameplay, mitigating some of the cons.  
Personally I miss the pre-teamspeak days, where combat was slower,  you actually typed commands to your teammates, and allowed for more strategy rather than the current 'maximize button presses per minute, dodge when you see a swing' tactic to overcome your foes.
