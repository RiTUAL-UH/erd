 This happened somewhere else, but it doesn't surprise me that similar things have happened in other places.

 Right? I loved that dog so much more after I found out that she saved my parent's life. Coincidentally, I married a dog trainer. 




 I never really found out the whole answer, but I was told that he just hated God and hated the church and wanted to do something about it, so he chose my family as the thing to destroy. 




 This all took place in the mid 90's when I was about 12. My dad is a Pastor, and we used to live next door to the church in a small town of about a hundred people in the middle of a farming community. One night, I spent the night at my friend's house which was on the same block, about two houses away. I have no idea how, but I ended up sleeping all the way through the night, and when I woke up I was told something about a fire and that we were going to meet my parents at a breakfast for the firefighters. When we drove by the church, the back side of it was burned black through to the frame and there was smoke damage everywhere, not to mention water damage from the firefighting. Again, this was only a couple hundred feet from where my friend lived so I have no idea how I slept through all of it. 

There was an investigation as to the cause of the fire, but since it was such a small community with limited resources, the cause was never fully determined. It was just assumed that the fire started in my Dad's office because of his computer and other electronics in there. My grandfather was a firefighter for his whole career and he stopped by and looked at the damage, and in his opinion, he said that there was no way that an electrical short could have caused the kind of fire damage that the building endured. Months go by, things are returning to normal as the church is being rebuilt, and finally it's finished and we start having services in the church again. One day, one of the youth gets up front because he says he has something to say. My spidey-sense is tingling because this isn't normal, his whole family is up there with him and he can't look anyone in the eye. He confesses to burning the church, and my jaw just drops. I can't imagine any other time in my life where I've been as horrifically shocked as I was at that moment. He turns himself into the police, makes his statement, and then does community service at the church. He didn't go to jail because he was a juvenile. I can't remember if he had any kind of detention or not. 

Now the scary part. I didn't find out about this until much later, probably when I was 16 or 17 and we had moved away from there. My dad got a call from the police and they said he needed to come in to read the statement that was given by the guy who burned the church. He declined and said that he had already talked to him, and he was ok with it. The police insisted, and told him there was something in the report that he didn't know. My dad went down to the police station, read the report, and found out that the night the church was burned something else had happened. In the middle of the night, while I was over at my friend's house, our family dog started acting weird and insisted to be let outside. My dad got up and let her out and didn't bother waiting for her to want to come back in. After that, both of my parents said my dog was growling and making sounds that they had never heard her make before, like she was trying to keep something out of the yard. Sure enough, on the police report the guy who burned the church said that his intentions were to set my family's house on fire and kill all of us, but he couldn't get in the yard because he was scared of our dog (she was a husky-shepard mix). Another important detail- our house was covered in this foam insulation that would have engulfed the whole house in flames in no time. 

Since I wasn't told about it until later in life, it took awhile for it to sink in. Even though I wasn't home at the time, there's still a police report out there that says that someone tried to kill me. I don't know if you ever really get over something like that, but you use it to help you remember that life is precious and to take advantage of every day. 

TL;DR Someone tried to burn down my house when I was a kid with my family inside, but was stopped before he got the chance.

 Amateur audio engineering. To have a decent setup you can expect an initial investment of a few thousand dollars which will get you an audio interface, cables, a microphone or two, and a digital audio workstation. That will allow you to record about one instrument at a time. If you want virtual instruments, expect to pay about $500 for a somewhat decent library, and then you need a MIDI keyboard or external controller to play them with. Then if you need effects for processing your signals you pay more, and if you need decent preamps you pay more, better microphones, better interface... and so on. Once you get to a certain point you have to consider having a dedicated space to record, and that means adding acoustic treatment for the room. To have enough equipment to record a 4-5 piece band with professional gear will set you back over $100,000.  




 No other intro gets me as pumped up to watch 21+ hours of a movie franchise as this one! 









 I would have a small piece of each planet in my house, and as many pieces from dwarf planets and large asteroids as I could get as well.

 Good summary! NOT! 




 This happened a few days ago. I'm re-posting for weekend rules because this got deleted the first time. At the time I wrote this, it was around 3am. Normally at that time, I'm sleeping peacefully in my bed, but I couldn't sleep anymore because of the levels of adrenaline in my bloodstream. My fingers were literally shaking as I wrote this. The rest of the story is unchanged from when I wrote it, so when I say 'tonight' I mean the night that it happened, etc.

As a little bit of background, I normally go to sleep around 10 or 11pm and my wife comes to bed much later, around 2am. Tonight I guess I heard her starting to come to bed and it woke me up. I realized my bladder was full, and right as my tired brain was making the decision to get out of bed I heard the toilet flush. All I thought was 'Great, now it's available!' so I got up. I wanted to expend as little energy as possible so that it would be easy to get back to sleep, so I was walking towards the door in our bedroom when it opened suddenly. All I see on the other side of the door is this bright light which makes me squint and stop in my tracks. My wife, who didn't hear me get up, only sees someone standing right inside the door when she didn't expect anyone to be there. She sees this figure standing there with its arms completely at its sides, totally still, and eyes appearing to be closed. It was at this moment that her brain broke (or rather worked as it's intended to).

She initially stepped back a little, mouth open, arms tucking in, gasping slightly, and then she went full on panic mode and started screaming. She yelled my name three times, each one louder than the last, while recoiling in horror at the sight of someone creepily waiting for her. While she was yelling, I still didn't know quite what was going on, only that I was still extremely sleepy and that I wanted to expend little to no energy so that I could just go to the bathroom and get back to sleep. This changed quickly as I saw her scream into her hands and collapse onto the floor, crying and hyperventilating. She later told me that she didn't collapse until she recognized the stranger in her house was her husband.

I thought she would calm down rather quickly. It didn't happen that way though. She must have used up all her fight or flight instinct for the next 50 years, because she was just shaking and crying and breathing erratically for several minutes. She described it as her brain recognizing that everything is ok, but her body was still in full-blown panic. Meanwhile, I was holding her and apologizing, telling her that it was me and that it was ok, I wasn't going to murder her. Around then she said 'You scared the shit out of me! ...NOT LITERALLY!"

I still really had to go to the bathroom and I was scared that I would literally pee on her, so I left her for a second to go take care of business. Our dog recognized that something was not right and came up to my wife the way she greets us when we come home, with her head low, ears back, and wiggling. She nuzzled my wife with her nose and anytime she stopped getting petted she put her paw on my wife's arm. She's currently still on the bed even though she normally chooses to sleep downstairs.

After things had calmed down a bit, we had to talk to each other to figure out exactly what happened. I told her I wasn't trying to induce a full-blown panic attack, or even scare her a little. I was just sleepy and needed to pee. Now we're both coming down from adrenaline highs, and neither of us is going to be able to sleep for awhile. My wife says she now knows how people feel right before they're murdered.

TL; DR- Went to go to the bathroom, almost ended up with poop everywhere. 









 I don't remember, but it was over 5 years ago. They were prescription meds given to us by the vet. As far as the dosage, we would only give him a fraction of a pill. They didn't really stop his car sickness, and in addition to being covered in drool he was cross-eyed, lethargic, and it took too long to wear off. 




 We used to give him meds, but he was always so loopy afterwards that we discontinued it. He's actually gotten quite a bit better. He's kinda drooly for about a half hour and then he stops and settles in. We also stop feeding him the night before big trips which helps, but we give him food after he stops drooling and he does ok. 









 That's beautiful. I made the same choice, and regretted it only until I found that through my job I was able to live my dreams without being burdened by them. 


































 You're closest- it's between Salida and Caon city. 




 THAT'S what's on the other side of my BACON?? NOOO!!! 









 I just moved here as well, but you might be able to find some places here: http://www.singletracks.com/Colorado-bike-trails_6.html?filterBy=%7Cloc:38.833889~-104.820833~25~Colorado%20Springs%2C+CO 









 When I was on deployment to the Persian Gulf on a minesweeper, we were doing a large multi-national operation to clear the historically mined areas near the large oil platforms that were mined during the first Gulf War. We had a media day where all of the ships got in a large circle, all facing inwards. The goal was to take a picture of all the ships together, and right in the middle of everything they were going to blow up a mine. As all of the ships had just finished getting into position, a sandstorm came out of nowhere and just swallowed up everything around us. We couldn't see the ship next to us, which was only a few hundred yards away. I thought that there was no way they would blow up the mine without being able to see, but then I heard the countdown come over the radio. Ten, nine, eight...  




 I learned that you can side-chain instrument track using the multipressor plugin in Logic to open up room for vocals, and set it so that it cuts the frequencies when the vocals kick in and then immediately returns them after the vocals cut out. 


































 [This](http://pawvillage.com) website has a huge database of dogs and breeds with some going back to the dogs that were bred to start the breed. Check it out! 




 [Here](http://i.imgur.com/iJlJahd.jpg) is a picture of our dog with her mother and her siblings. We can trace her lineage back to the founding dogs of the breed, but I understand that white huskies cause confusion. We get people asking us what breed she is all the time! :) 




 From my wife- the raw expert and also a dog trainer: "It varies depending on what sources are available and what version of raw. We do 'Prey Model Raw' and to feed two 40 pound dogs and 2 cats is about $2-3 per day. We get a lot of free meat from hunters as well, and get great deals by buying in bulk from co-ops." Hope this helps! 




 I can't speak for the other dog, since I just met him today, but my dog is raw fed, which helps with their coat. 




 I care. That's my dog! 




 Actually she's a full Siberian Husky from a reputable breeder, registered with the AKC. 




 Yeah, this was taken near Rangewood. Nice pic! 









 Thanks! Hopefully the wait for Fallout goes quickly!
