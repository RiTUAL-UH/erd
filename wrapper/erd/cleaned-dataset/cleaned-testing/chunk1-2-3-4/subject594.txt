 Well, statistically it is not as bad as you think it is.  Here is my very specific example: I used to live in Louisa County, Iowa which is in Tornado Alley.  There was one time in the 14 years I was there that several tornados came through.  0 fatalities.  Here is the hard data: http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/Iowa/Louisa/table  




 The assistant principal at my high school outlawed purses on the basis that carrying them was sexist against boys (although there was no rule that they couldn't.... they would just have to put up with harassment from their male peers....).  So my sister and her friends threaded a string through tampon boxes and wore them as purses while they dragged their car keys behind them on another string.  Believe it or not, the rule against purses stopped being enforced.  This is some cheek, I can't believe it worked.  Back in my day, I just carried a billfold that constantly fell out of my inadequate female pockets.  




 A toad.  I was camping and I saw this toad hopping towards the fire pit.  I fished him out as quick as I could but his back legs were all melted and he was chirping.  I set him down and stomped him as hard as I could as an act of mercy.  I still feel guilty.  




 If you wrap your warm soda can in a wet paper towel before you put it in the freezer for 20 minutes, it will be consistently cold rather than that kind-of sort-of cold you get normally.  (Always set a timer on your phone when putting sodas in the freezer, dear ones.) 




 Sorry for being redundant! :) 




 I'm sincere but not serious whenever I joke around with my dementia patients in Hospice.  Obviously dementia is not funny, but when we laugh together, it's not so scary for a moment.  




 This isn't exactly what you're asking, but I think it's pretty funny in retrospect.  My ex-boyfriend let his mother think I took his v-card, so she was pretty much awful to me (the son thief who turned him on to premarital sex).... I'm not sure what she thinks he was doing at college for three years.   




 TROLL ALERT.... LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THIS IS NOT A DRILL.  WE HAVE A TROLL. 

Edit: This is very ironic... So many people upset about how feminists don't call out extremists in their own group, and yet I'm getting downvoted.  Oh, Reddit, do you really know what you want?  




 Right, I don't claim to have all the answers.  What I took issue with is the statement (that you did not make) that women only claim feminism when it benefits them.  I don't believe this to be the case.  A lot of "feminist issues" are merely human issues, and, indeed, a lot of men's issues happen to be feminist issues.  You offered an example of when women failed to pull the feminist card so to speak.  I refuted it with a very specific example.  I am not a feminist when it is convenient.  I help where I can.   




 Well, you're setting a great example for how to take another road.  I'm not on the same page as you are, but you made me stop and examine what it is I believe, and that is a beautiful thing.  Thank you for being respectful and for taking the time to try to enlighten people.  I appreciate you.  




 I am so sorry for what I'm about to say here, because it's not something that can be proven, it is merely anecdotal, but any man who thinks that a girl need only cry "rape" and ruin his life has very little first hand experience with how things actually work.  I'm sorry to say that when my best friend went to our FEMALE HR director because her boss sent her unsolicited messages on Facebook about his sex dreams about her (he being married and twice her age), her exact words to my male boss was "There was something more going on there, she was pursuing him, I'd bet my life." She was pursuing an overweight, bald man with a wife and three children.  She was asking to be put in a situation where she had no idea what to do and agonized over whether to get help for over a month.  She was forced to remain under this man for almost a year until she was promoted beyond him.  She wasn't raped.  This isn't comparable to a rape.  But think about Brandon Teena.  A female to male transgender person who was raped by two men.  Look into how successful he was when he tried to get help. 




 This was sheer brilliance.  




 Edit: Sorry, I thought I was talking to the same person the whole time here.

Shutupharu: I'm glad you're giving me a chance to explain.  Direct combat wasn't something that women were allowed into without fighting for that right.  It's a job with a high probability of fatalities and we fought to do it. :)

Monty 845: I don't think that what you're suggesting is altogether reasonable, you see, I don't want to put my life in peril, but I'm quite sure that if I did, I could apply for a job on an oil rig.  However, I'm sure I wouldn't be physically capable of doing the job.  Do I think that the job should be made easier for me?  Absolutely not.  Full disclosure: I would rather be carried out of a burning building than dragged out by a woman, BUT do I think that a woman shouldn't be turned away without giving her a chance to prove herself?  Absolutely.  You see?  We're not all crazy.  




 I think it is very admirable that you can view a terrible experience as a positive lesson.  I'm also glad that you were able to come to terms with your rape.  I'm sure you're a vibrant and interesting person who deserves to be happy.  Thank you for existing.  




 I know you're not going to do this, but I encourage you to look into sexual assault statistics for the U.S. Armed Forces, and then to remember that until very recently, all assaults were to be reported to your direct commanding officer (you know, the person that would be reprimanded for that kind of behavior going on within their contingent).  Before I get accused of being callous of assaults on men, I'm absolutely not.  It breaks my heart that so many of them suffer in silence thanks to the idea that one of the worst things you can be in this society is "a little bitch." 




 I'm sorry that that happened to you.  Truly.  




 I am now going to systematically upvote all your comments everywhere to show my sisterly support of you.  Yes really.  Don't thank me, it's not about me.  It's about you.  I only wish I could do more.  




 Very eloquently put. I dislike the misconception that feminist issues only affect women positively.  Men are nearly twice as likely to commit suicide and that has not a little to do with the myths that men are not allowed to be anything other than hyper-masculine.  I've never seen a feminist cheer when they read a story about a young man being raped by an adult women, that's a feminist issue too.  I sincerely hope that your optimism is borne out.  Thank you for your thoughtful and brave response.  




 Can I just say I like your swagger?  I'm crying out of one eye now. 




 Put the bunneh back in the bahx.  




 Con Air.  SOOOO GOOOD SOOOO BAD. 




 "Mind your p's and q's" is actually supposed to mean "Mind your pints and quarts," meaning don't get drunk and pick fights with people.  Most folks think it means "Be polite." 




 His heart is in the right place.

 Go outside... Chew some gum... walk as fast as you can while you chew the gum.  I bet your rage doesn't last ten minutes.  This works for heading off a panic attack too.  




 If you get one from me, I either agree with what you're saying, find you well spoken, was entertained, or appreciate your support.  Getting one seems 100% random.  You never know what redditors will like, it seems.  




 What are the Basement Jaxx for 300?  




 "I'm sorry that no one has responded to this question yet. I don't exactly fit the bill for what you're asking, but I am a volunteer who spends about six hours a week as a companion in Hospice. In our training, we are taught to encourage whatever the person is feeling. If they are angry, yeah! You be angry! If they are sad, we are to cry with them. If they can't really communicate, we're to hold their hand and just let them know we're here and we care. We had a speaker come in and share that the four most important things we can say to someone who is dying are "I love you," "Thank you," "I'm sorry," and "I forgive you." This dovetails nicely with what you're asking. The best way to come to terms with your own death is to live a life where if you were killed tomorrow, you wouldn't wish you had said any of these things. Don't wait. Just be brave and live." 




 Reading an interview with Billy Corgran without making this face: :-/ 




 I upvoted this, but I think you mean staying happily married to someone who is famous.  Why do they even bother getting married?  What is the point, I ask?  




 The pages of a book! Nothing better. :) 




 I think that the one thing about it that really got to me was the rage in the rebuttal against people saying they care about the health of people they don't know personally.  I think that all life is precious, and my anxiety tends to focus on death a lot.  One of the ways I struggle is when people don't hide their internal machinery well.  Just as I get nervous around people who work out too much and wear their veins sticking out, I get nervous around obese people because eating is the ultimate proof of mortality.  If you get hungry, you are going to die and that is very sad.  Is it such a bad thing to not want people you know personally to die?  Why wouldn't you believe that I care?  The heart is such an uncomfortable concept even in a healthy person, but the fact that I knew a person who was so morbidly obese their heart failed trying to beat against the back of his ribcage is terrifying for me.  I don't want that for anyone.  (I'm sorry, I know this was 100% weird, but it was also serious.)  




 Read.  Reading makes you more emphatic, thoughtful, introspective, knowledgable, and kind.  If you simply can't go out and experience things first hand, you can always read about them until you get to that point.   




 That divorce is a sad thing.  For example, Neil Young and Peggi Young getting divorced after 30 years of marriage.  At first I was like how sad, but now I'm like, you know, Peggi is nearly 70, Neil is obviously cranky (yes brilliant, but c'mon you know he is cranky as fuck), good for her! Go be free!  See new people and do what you want!  GO!  




 Saxondale. 




 If you aren't selected for trial, you're on call for two weeks. Hope this helps!  




 Almost every piece that was featured in the Granta issue "Betrayal" has stuck with me.  It forced me to think about a lot of really uncomfortable things.   




 I used to have these super graphic violent dreams about animals.  The worst one starts with me coming out of a stall in a mall restroom and there was this overweight lady torturing a dachshund with a taser.  I left the restroom and there where these people all crowded together in a circle.  When I pushed my way in, I saw that they were trying to tear this toucan apart with their hands.  The toucan was jerking his head and making this clicking noise in his throat and he had a tear coming out of one of his eyes.  It fucked me up for a very long time. I can still hear that clicking sound.    




 Lots of people dip their jelly toast points into a fried egg.  I just make a fried egg and jelly toast sandwich.  




 Jeremiah Johnson 




 I don't know about best ever, period, the end, but the best acted scene I've ever seen is Robert Redford at the end of Jeremiah Johnson when Bear Claw observes that the "Winters run long up here."  The sheer amount of pain that man managed to get into a "Yeah," it fucking rends my heart every time.  BRAVO REDFORD, Bra-VO. 




 This doesn't ruin my day, but it annoys the fuck out of me: If the CEO's phone rings three times with no answer, it rolls to me.  People will wait until it rolls to me and then hang up.  This leaves a stupid missed call icon on my phone that I can only get rid of by calling them back.  




 You click your username and then pick the downvoted tab. 




 I don't think so.  Here is why: I once encountered a boy who was not very solicitous or interesting or funny or even a good sport.  He was not conventionally attractive, in fact he was a bit overweight and kind of looked like a penguin.  But when I would sit down next to him, I would get hyper, mega turned on.  I couldn't sleep next to him, I was too aroused.  It had to be pheromones.  I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he had no similar reaction to me.  I think the real question is how much of any of this had to do with the fact that I'd been on hormonal birth control for five years at that point.     




 Too cold to snow.  




 The question was "Something that sounded great in theory and was fucking terrible in practice." My response was breastfeeding.  Apparently the plight of new mothers is extremely unpopular.   




 I just checked the parent company's website and the only thing we're looking for is in Hartford for an engineer.... I pulled up a lot of results by just looking for "call center CT" in Google, I'd do that since I don't know specifically what city you're in. :) 




 I used to work for an outsourcing call center (this isn't telemarketing, it's mostly utility company customer service), and I can tell you that call centers offer an awful lot of upward mobility.  My former boss only had a GED and he's making well over $60k a year as the call center manager.  He started as an agent on the phones.  I was there for five years, was promoted four times, and was making $20.18/hr when I left.  I wish you good luck, sir! :)

Edit: I should say "Call Center Manager" is a title. It sounds like he was just a general type manager reading it again... He wasn't, he over saw the team of 12 major supervisors and all of their team leads, who were responsible for 300+ employees under them.  He ran the whole center and sometimes more than one location. I figured I should clarify. :) 




 How would I know? I'm an American!  Good job, media ban! :) 




 The 9 times tables.  Or any other times table come to that.  




 He made a blog for the sole purpose of complaining about me, describing our break-up as "harrowing."  I promise I didn't try to push him off a cliff.  




 No! Who the hell is Russel Williams?  If he's under a media ban, it's working!  




 Hey, thank you!  I'm not, but I like to write them occasionally.  I'm also fond of this one, although it is not on topic : Cactus in sweater / Never to be cold again / in the starry night 

or how about this one about how my mom hates carnies? : Sticky hand pulls me / seeds rattle in sweaty cup / do not talk to them

Obviously I don't take myself very seriously, but my post was supposed to be about how the world calls to you and your family calls to you and you need to remember you belong to both. :) 




 I'm with you.  I steadfastly believe that folks who don't like eggplant don't know you're supposed to press them.  They're amazing!   




 I have seen them all, and I don't like any of them.  Apart from uniformly suffering from pacing issues, he just can't seem to help himself when it comes to cheeky jokes within his films.  He just seems so damn pleased with himself!  Also, three of his most famous films completely missed the point of the reference material thanks to his casting choices.  That is very upsetting to me.  




 Oh, ANYTHING by Stanley Kubrick.  




 Stars bright over house / Warm light from inside places / They shine for you too 




 How about the most awkward thing I do on a consistent basis?  If you text me and I don't want to talk to you or wish you didn't have my number, I'll respond with "Who is this?" 




 I'm going to be telling people about this side-quest where I gain a severed arm as a weapon for the rest of my life.  So far, it's been true.  I'm doing it now.  HagtagGimblesProsthetics.  




 If by best you mean so bad it's almost good, probably the date-rape montage in Dahmer which featured "More, More, More," as the soundtrack.  




 Saxondale. 




 For me, it is explaining something totally implausible by throwing in that there was another dimension at the last possible moment.  I'm looking at you, Clive Barker.  




 I'm not really sure what you're looking for from me since our experiences are very, very different.  I can't go back in a time machine and make my interactions as a person working for a Fortune 500 subsidiary that happened to use a temp agency any different from what they are.  Our entry level employees are paid $8.50 when they hit the door.  We pay $16.50 an hour to the temp agency for people who temp in those same positions.  Obviously if we can buy out their contract, it's better to do so as soon as possible.  We have to pay that hourly fee while we train them, a time when they are not generating any profit for our company.  I'm sorry you feel you need to argue with me, but maybe the area we live in plays a factor here.   




 Just look up Luke Magnotta on Wikipedia.  I was serious.  




 While I appreciate that you have a very strong opinion that is likely rooted in experience, it happens to be at odds with what I've seen.  It's definitely true that places are not obligated to hire on a temp, they're paying a premium for  your work and have already had to eat training costs.  You'd be a much better candidate than a person off the street would be, having come from a temp agency for that reason alone.   




 1 lunatic 1 icepick is totally real.  




 100%, although after Stephen Collins, I'm seriously worried it's going to be the next equality frontier.  I can just hear it now.... "I was born this way..." "I don't actually harm children...." 




 It was yesterday.  I asked for help in building a set-up to play vinyl records within my specific budget.  I'm happy to say I put in an order that night.  Thanks, Reddit!  




 I am a big advocate of researching cooking techniques before you start, but if it's too late for that, use a cooking thermometer.  Safe internal temps are different for each kind of product.  :) 

If you don't have one, as a last resort, pick a really thick item you've cooked, cut into it.  If the juice is clear instead of red, you're good.  




 My advice is actually to sign on with a temp company.  Temp companies are used to extremely high employee turnover, so they tend to skip doing background checks.  Because a temp agency is supposed to run a background check, the company you are matched with will likely not do one.  This is how my former company ended up with several level 1 sex offenders on the payroll.  Let my disturbing experience be your boon!  Best of luck to you... It's awesome that you're so driven. :) 




 I think a better question is why is Neil Young still Canadian when he's lived in California the vast majority of his life?  Can you answer this OP?  I'm dead serious.   




 I know that you guys do media freezes for atrocious crimes.  The average American has no idea who Paul Bernardo is, and definitely have never heard of Luke Magnotta, which is crazy when you think about it.  




 Thanks for being a good sport. ;-)

 I love it when a man isn't afraid of asking about things he doesn't understand.  Wanting to learn is very sexy and it connotes that you understand that seeking knowledge is always more important than saving face.  If you don't know what "loquacious" means, ask me! I would love to explain it to you. :) 




 I like your style. 




 I actually don't care, so long as it isn't what it is.  Before and after I'm married, my name is unique to the entire planet (or at least folks searchable on the internet), meaning if you know my damn name, you can find me.  This has happened. 




 I thought of a good one... My mom once said to my cousin Jason that he could go into the basement and have Hot Sex with Grandma.  She was down in the basement drinking Hot Sex which I think is sort of like Bailey's.  He turned so red you could've fried an egg on his head.  




 Hardcore Pawn.  (Which in no way stops me from watching it.) 




 Well, I wish I could agree with you, but American Tabloid was the last straw for me.  These days, I'd take a good Southern Gothic over any gumshoe story.  Thanks for the banter! :)  




 Since you mentioned Black Dahlia.... Teddy bears with locks of children's hair taped between their legs? 




 You start knitting and wait for her to approach you because you're that interesting guy who isn't afraid to knit. 




 Start knitting.  Go to your local yarn shop and knit.  Blog about knitting.  You will not believe how many cute girls knit these days.  I follow 15 boy knitters on Tumblr just because they are boys who knit. None of them happen to like girls, but you see.... there's a niche here.  You only need google "Ryan Gosling knitting" to see what the hell I'm talking about. 




 In this blog, he described our break-up as "harrowing."  I mean, at that moment, part of me was like "Don't be so dramatic," but part of me was like "Yesss, he thinks I am Liam Neeson."  




 I'm walking to a meeting I'm already late for.  I have to present at the meeting, but I'm not prepared and it involves math.  I'm stuck behind someone who is walking very slowly.  They are wearing flip-flops that they are dragging across the floor.  They are also whistling.  While all of this is happening, I'm wearing pantyhose and an ill-fitting outfit.  It's 90 degrees inside with 60% humidity.  




 How has no one said eggnog?  If you drink a whole carton of eggnog, you will regret it with your body and your soul.  Just ask my husband.  




 A subscription to Granta.  Every issue challenges me to think about things I never have before and to examine my reactions closely.  




 Almost anything for your infant. Almost.  




 I went back and looked at every letter and e-mail and chat history and birthday card I ever exchanged with him.  Looking at everything in order as a cohesive progression allowed me to come to conclusions I had avoided before.  By the time I was done, I realized I never wanted to be with him at all, I just wanted to be him.  I felt that he was what I could be if I weren't afraid.  He was me without limits.  




 I'm a woman, and my contribution is slipping into a hot bath when you're really cold.  




 Me and the unsightly callous on my right ring finger approve of your contribution.  




 Anything where people employ aggressive upselling.  Cable, insurance, funeral services. 




 Backstory aside, let me tell you for future reference, that yes, a teenage girl could absolutely get pregnant the day before her period.  A woman's cycle especially when she is young, can be far from consistent.  There is a possibility that it's not a period at all but implantation spotting.  You should be practicing safe sex if you don't want to impregnant someone.  It's as simple as that.  




 Red Velvet Oreos. 




 That is so rude, outting me like that!  




 Dr. Pepper.... Did you know that Dr. Pepper is actually owned cooperatively by Pepsi and Coke?  Read about the Soda Wars of the 90's.  Fascinating stuff.  




 I would think since I'm 105 lbs and a C-cup you would be like, o bby, bring your neurosis over here.  Tell me more about how you like to count things.  




 All of our survival instincts are suddenly not allowed.  You can't run away.  As a female, I find police to be terrifying.  









 Hello;
Does anyone know off hand why the Pro-Ject is a better choice and thus higher price than the TEAC? 
Thank you for your help! :)  




 Hello; I'm looking to buy a full set up for about $800, with a bit of wiggle room.  Can you please suggest what would be the best use of my money?  Thank you... this is way overwhelming!  
























 There are a lot of little tricks you can use to help you feel better when you are depressed.  Set a small attainable goal for yourself.  Like baking a cake from scratch.  Focus on researching the perfect recipe, focus on going out and getting the ingredients, measure and check for advice on good techniques.  You make that cake.  You eat some of that cake.  Think of your next challenge.

The best friend of depression is inactivity.  We feel tired and so we think what we want is to lie down and not think, but we just feel sick at the end of the day.  And we think, and think and think.  If you focus on doing something, any little thing, you can get out of your head.  If you can't manage to do it for yourself, read.  Read a novel.  Be someone else.     




 My advice is to:

Travel (See this world that holds no charms for you!)

Volunteer (Do things out of the goodness of your own heart with no selfish motives.)

Make goals for yourself (See it as a challenge, play a game with yourself.  You seem pretty bright to me, or at the very least well-written... how far can that take you?  Can you trick someone into giving you a job you're not qualified for?  Can you write a novel?  Can you learn to cook a perfect macaron?)

MOVE.  (For the love of god, don't lie on the couch or sit in front of your computer all day.  Go out, go out in public.  People watch, laugh, see the sights, move your body.)

The world really is a beautiful, strange place.  We only get to live in it one time and there is a good chance that there is nothing after.  Try to reach inside and find that part of you that is curious about how things work, that can laugh at absurdities.  Try to find someone who understands you.  Try to find the things that appeal to you.  Please live.  I don't know you, not at all, but I would still be very sad if you died.    




 The only thing that I think you may need to plan for is whether ME has a great need for game wardens post-grad.  You may need to move to do what you love.  Never pay more than the minimum on your loans once you graduate, there is no point.  Save every spare dime you have for a down payment on your house and start establishing your credit.  You do that by paying for things (meaning bills) on time consistently and by opening at least one line of credit.  Once you're in the workforce, don't forget to put some money into your retirement.  It's very important to start that early. :)

Good luck, I like what you're saying here.   




 I think the determining factor is how important your family is to you.  Some people are very family oriented and are happiest living near them, I'm one of those people.  If I were you, I would regret not moving home.  Money is one of those things that's very transient.  As they say "If you wait until you have enough money to have a baby, you will never have a baby."  A pay cut is something you'll figure out if it means being near your family.

Now if you're not that close to your family, you've got the right idea.  You need to identify if you're happy with your current situation, and if you're not, do things to make it what you want!  Remember, we can literally die at any moment, annnnny moment at all.  Think, if I were to die tomorrow, would I regret anything or would I die peacefully?  Do what you can to deal with any regrets you think you might have. :)  




 Hello!

A few things:

-Make sure your resume isn't from a template, you want it to be unique looking in style, professional but memorable!

-When applying, always write a cover letter for your resume.  Consider acknowledging that you don't have a lot of history, but that your drive and skills are a great fit for the company and they only need interview you in person to see how passionate you are to being part of their team.  Be earnest if that's who you are!

-Volunteer.  If you need something for a resume but don't have years of work history to illustrate your talents, volunteer in fields related to what you want to do.

Hope this helps! :) 




 The tone of this complaint is very disturbing.  You're calling his behavior gross, insinuating that you've been confronting him, accusing him of being lazy, admitting that you've been locking things up from someone you're supposed to be taking care of... 

You're the epitome of an unreliable narrator, but if what you're saying *is* true, he's probably acting out because negative attention is better than no attention at all.  

Listen, children who come from broken homes are not always easy to deal with.  They may not come to you with open arms and open hearts and that has nothing to do with you personally.  You're clearly dealing with inadequacy issues to be this defensive towards someone who is so much younger than you.  You need to shelve it.  Be the bigger person, the adult.  Make up your mind to love him no matter what, no matter how hard it is, no matter if you're ever thanked, no matter if he looks just like your husband's ex-wife.  Just choose.  Choose the right thing.  Even if he never lets you in, being a kind, good person to someone who needs that in their life is its own reward.  I really hope you can turn this around.    




 You need to cut that emotional extortionist out of you life.  Block her number, change your e-mail address, cut her out!  

You do not need someone like this in your life, no one deserves to be treated like less than a human being and from what you've put here, that's just what she's doing.  

I'm not sure what exactly to say about how you can get back up, since I don't know much about your life situation (Are you graduating high school soon?  Terribly depressed?  Considering a move?  Stuck at home?), but if you would like to discuss any of that privately, please don't hesitate to shoot me a PM and I'll do my best to help you work through whatever.  
 




 First of all, you should never apologize for working towards what you've wanted the most all your life.  You're a hard working, driven individual who should be lauded.... a wonderful example for the people around you.  Don't feel guilty.  This is your life.  You have to be your own advocate.

You don't need to break it off, and I know I'm about to say one of the worst words in the relationship lexicon, but here we go: Give him the ultimatum.  Just tell him in an organized, calm manner what you basically explained here: You have been working your whole life to build a wonderful career and life for yourself away from this place that holds so many bad memories for you.  That you want the very best for yourself and your family, and that means being in a place where you can excel professionally and personally.  That you want him to be your family more than anything, but you just can't go home.  

He's probably going to break things off, maybe even for a bit, but he'll probably also come back.  And if he doesn't?  You'll know for sure that it wasn't meant to be.  He'll have done you a favor.  We always want what is best for the people we love.  If he really can't be happy unless he's home, and you can't be happy back at home, the two of you need to find happiness apart, but the truth is that a lot of times, guys just fear change.  He may well just give in when you make it clear that his refusal to move forward will cost him his relationship with you. 




 You either owe your friends an apology or you're being paranoid (so an apology isn't going to hurt).  I would just reach out via a text or an e-mail or even on the phone if you care a lot, a lot about that person and say something to the effect of "I wanted to apologize to you for not being as available as I've been in the past.  Your friendship is very important to me, so I want to make it very clear that while this in no way excuses my carelessness, it has everything to do with my wedding and the move and nothing to do with how I feel about you.  When all this is done, we should get together; I promise not to say one word about me.  I miss you and I'll see you soon."  Follow it up with a few random texts here and there between your apology and the wedding.  Nice things like "I saw an interview with George Clooney this morning, and it reminded me of that time, blah blah blah. You're great."  Just let them know they're on your mind. :) 




 The best way to handle stage fright and to make your speech better (not to mention get those extra points for time) is to practice your speech in its entirety, aloud, and time it.  You don't need to have an audience, although a tester will be able to give you pointers.  Hope this helps!   




 When you say "live on your own" do you mean you want to buy a house?  




 I met my husband at work.  Initially he was above me in the company, but I was not one of his reports.  Eventually I was promoted beyond his role.  A lot of people within the company had no idea we were married.  We made it a point to not be affectionate at work.  We talked about work related things when we needed to.  We had to go to meetings together and sometimes worked on assignments together.  It is important to report your relationship to your HR representative.  They will decide if your immediate supervisor needs to know.  Just keep it professional! :) 




 Hello ExDrK;

Almost all jobs have a 30 day grace period in which either party can terminate the working relationship without notice.  Sometimes this is included in the offer letter, sometimes it's just a disclaimer form, sometimes it is in the Non-Disclosure agreement.  I would got to your HR representative (or call the phone number for the service they use) and ask.  Just be very apologetic and professional and nice.  The truth is that most employers don't really want employees who don't want to be there, it's more respectful to just come out with it.  

Hope this helps!  




 I guess my question would be why does she need to move 1000 miles away to study veterinary science?  You can literally do this anywhere!  I can understand that she might be in more demand in a large city, but that's neither here nor there until she's licensed.  Unless you're going to tell me she's planning to move in with a specific relative there, I would question if she isn't just looking for a way out of the relationship.  If it were me, I'd actually go along any way.  You only live once, and while all change can be scary, it is almost always worth it.  You could live in a new city, explore a new field, and if the relationship goes south, meet new people.  Worst comes to worst, move back.  The truth is that you're in charge of your own destiny.  Think about what would really make you happy and go for it!  




 Well, I'm guessing that you probably have folks on staff that could do similar work, if you need to know now, you could bring them the examples and ask them to guestimate how long they would take to build something similar from the ground up.  I'm sorry I'm not able to give you anything more concrete!  I'm sure you'll figure it out. :) 




 This isn't particularly scientific, but if it were me, I'd take the documents to their contributors in person and ask them to estimate how much time they put into them, conservatively.  Unless you have access to the original files, that's probably the best you'll be able to do.   




 Exit only, bro. 




 Hey, thank YOU for posting the awesome reference link.  I get really jazzed about this sale... I typically can't afford their eyes (in good conscience) until this happens, so I figured someone else might want to know. :) 




 Sorry to piggy-back, but that's another great thing about Amazon.  A lot of the albums you buy physical copies of come with a complimentary digital copy via auto-rip.  I love that I can order vinyl for my collection, but still have the convenience of "traveling copies" at no extra cost.  Before anyone asks, I'm not a paid rep for Amazon, I just really like it! 




 Thanks for the suggestion.  I'll check it out, maybe.  Have an upvote. :) 




 I think you're just being downvoted because he specified that he wasn't looking for iTunes in his question, but here, have an upvote on me. :) 




 Oh, no, don't worry about it man.  I can definitely see why you would think that. :) 




 I would imagine this would be a good combination... he probably gets you to experience things you wouldn't otherwise while not being such a Pollyanna that you'd get annoyed. :) 




 Two craziest things:

1) Someone had set up a glass of water with two perfect plastic REPLICAS of Beyer Asprin.  I've done some digging on the internet and still can't figure out why such a thing exists.  I have them in my jewelry box still almost ten years later.

2) We moved the credenza for spring cleaning and under it was a bag from the local sex shop.  It was full of those cheap dirty paperbacks and an un-opened package of huge anal beads.  




 There's a lot of hate for country music since people just think of Toby Keith or some other ignorant asshole.  There happens to be good country music out here.  I like Whiskeytown, Loretta Lynn, Neko Case, Shovels and Rope, the country Neil Young albums, Ryan Adams, I could go on...  




 I'm actually surprised at how much neutral there is... I can't really relate to this:
 
A neutral character does what seems to be a good idea. She doesn't feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good vs. evil or law vs. chaos. Most neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality. Such a character thinks of good as better than evil-after all, she would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones. Still, she's not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way.  




 Well, truthfully, he would never cheat.  I know that probably sounds like I'm taking him for granted, but, I mean, he never leaves the house and refuses to have anything to do with any person who isn't his immediate family.  Short of skipping work to have an affair (someone who loses 20+ hour a year in PTO because he refuses to take a day off, right), it would be ultra mega obvious.  

But we're playing pretend here.  If he did, I wouldn't really care much, but I would probably still leave.  




 So many stories about this guy, but one of the better ones what that we had a sheet of water running down into our living room (like two feet across, a literal sheet of water)... his explanation?  The water comes from Lake Superior, so it's extra cold... that water is condensation from the cold pipes and the warm air. 

Turned out to be the upstairs neighbor's bathtub overflow... she was just leaving the water on while she was in there.   




 Real Talk: I don't think cheating is a deal breaker, but if my husband cheated on me, I'd probably take it as a get out of jail free ticket and leave, never to re-marry.   




 I'm Chaotic - Good. :)

Edit: Description: A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him. He makes his own way, but he's kind and benevolent. He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations. He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do. He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society.  




 This is pretty awesome if you're not sure: http://www.easydamus.com/alignment.html  




 In MMOs, I like to be altruistic.  If I see a newbie, I ask them if they have any questions or need anything.  I like community in an MMO and eventually that little player you helped gets really good. :)

On Facebook, I think it's best to only use it as a virtual photo album for your long-distance family.  I tend to try to only post supportive things and photos for people who can't be close enough to see my family in person.

LinkedIn is something I only recommend you use if you have impressive networking contacts.  It's rather pointless if you don't.

My tactics on Reddit is mostly to just be nice.  It's worked out pretty well, everyone seems a lot nicer than I thought they would be going in. :)

Hope this helps! 




 Here you go, folks: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vvijiNjplLs/Uj26mtv3_sI/AAAAAAAACNA/n3gxV5xgj_s/s1600/harry-potter-chart.jpg

I'm actually an INFJ, so this isn't really a question to me, but, hell, three out of four is pretty good, I think... I don't really have an easy time doing social networking.  I have to talk myself into calling strangers.  The best advice I can give you is to keep your arms uncrossed, have a pleasant look on your face, if you're in a group, invite loners in, think of a few questions that you wouldn't mind being asked yourself and ask them.  This is pretty specific to how to network in a large group, so if you're looking for something else, just hit me with a reply and I'll help. :) 




 Well, I think your question goes to show that you actually think you should pay for the music you listen to, and good for you.  The average musician actually makes less than $50k a year.  I get my MP3s from Amazon.  Unlike iTunes, it's an actual MP3 file if you choose to download it.  You still have cloud storage and can get applications for both iOS and Droid.  You can even listen on your work computer from the website without downloading anything.  Hope this helps!  




 I think it depends on what kind of person your parent is.  My own mother is one of those people who is convinced that the way she thinks is the only way to think (not just with me, but with her husband... the phrase she uses is "yes, but they're wrong!"), as a consequence, she's a very poor listener.  I can tell her things flat out and she's trying so hard to hear things she can relate to, she never remembers a thing!  

I would imagine if your parent were one of those people who is constantly seeking a different point of view or who is curious about the world at large would have observed a million and six things about you without your noticing.  ;) 




 I think the biggest thing I'm dealing with right now is recognizing what people mean when they say "marriage is hard."  Like, I heard that and assumed it would be obvious, like you will argue and you need to make up or compromise or whatever.  I had no idea what was meant was that you're probably going to wonder all the time if the negative things are "normal."  

My husband doesn't really like to engage in conversations or discussions, he doesn't like to do things or travel, and he has a very low sex drive.  For a jag there I was thinking "Is this what a neglectful marriage is?  Should I leave?"  But I'm starting to recognize that what I make of my life is still my own responsibility.  I've abandoned waiting for his participation to do things that I want to do, I've started going out for drives and seeing things of visual interest, watching movies alone, going out to eat, volunteering, basically doing the things I seemed to think for some reason were off limits since he didn't want to do them.  It's not like he told me I can't, so only my own pre-conceived notion of what marriage is stopped me from doing these things.

I am starting to recognize what ha925 mentioned in their comment: Being able to control yourself during the downtimes.  Recognizing that there is a middle ground between all or nothing.  But I also agree with not-quite-obscure in a moderate way.  I don't think I'd ever do this again.  It seems to be a bit unnatural a lot of the time.   




 Ahahaha, my former boss joked with my husband about arranging a marriage between our babies (his son is two months old, my daughter is 7 months), he told me my husband's eyes went totally flat and he said 100% seriously "I don't think she's ever going to date."   




 Also true... a kid is like an automatic extra $3000 back on your taxes... of course, that doesn't really approach what you're spending on them, but you know.... Surprise you have $3000 is nice for paying back your co-pay for the delivery or getting a new roof on your house.  Thanks, Uncle Sam!  




 This is so true... my best friend had warned me that this would happen, and I was like "whatever, I'm going to watch a Serbian Film now," but I was so wrong.  I can't read or watch anything involving abuse to children!  I can't even read the damn newspaper!  Why did I never notice how much infanticide is in the newspaper before?!  




 I wholeheartedly relate to your first point... I don't think I've gone to the bathroom when I've wanted to or eaten a hot meal at an actual table in 6 months!  However, you don't even hesitate, this is what you do now.  You learn to love the cold coffee.  Ha ha. 

The second was longer in coming for me, it actually only hit me about a month ago.  I think it's because she has a personality now.   




 We never argue and here's why: My husband doesn't ever engage.  I'll say I feel x, y, and z, and this is why.  He'll stare at me.  Sometimes an hour later he'll come back and apologize for "being an asshole," or not knowing I felt that way.  That's how it works.  Very dramatic, huh?

Edit: Sorry, I ignored part II of the question.  My big points of contention are basically that he doesn't hear me.  How many times do I have to tell you that I can't stand not being able to see a damn thing in the house, but I still come home to find you swapped all the lightbulbs for colored ones that don't light anything?  Or why is it that when I'm trapped in the car with you we have to listen to Pig Destroyer three turns too loud and when I ask you to turn it down, you ignore me?  I know women get a bad rap for expecting men to read their minds, but I tell him what I want all the time, and it basically only guarantees that I won't get it.  It's exhausting.  




 Initially, there is no autonomy.  I know as a mother, my immediate feeling when I came home was that no one could swoop in and save me, this creature needed ME to feed her and no matter how tired or sore or scared or anything I was, it was too bad, here we are!  That was an odd feeling, I've never felt it before or since.  




 I recommend that you just start doing small things by yourself that give you room to breathe.  I volunteer with a hospice on the weekend, and my assignments require me to drive for an hour both ways to see my ladies.  This time by myself in the car with music I like to listen to greatly quells my wanderlust.  

A lot of the things that you've mentioned aren't really things that you can simply go out and do without there being some damage, but you know, I said to my husband (who is a major homebody and allergic to spending money) that I wanted to travel when our daughter was older.  I told him that I would love for him to come, but that if he didn't, I still needed to go.  I think a lot of young people go into marriage thinking that it means you'll do things together all the time, but the truth is that you might not ever do a thing if you wait for the other person to participate.  It's okay to do things alone! It makes you feel capable and smart and free.   




 Sorry for being redundant in the way this is worded, but how has being married changed what you thought marriage would be like as a single person? 




 I legit think it would be like the movie series the Purge.  It was be wayyy fucked up.   




 Pig Faced Women!  Specifically that there was a rich philanthropist who was believed to BE ONE and she couldn't even dispel it by making public appearances... It had to be an actress that she hired since we actually believe she has the head of a pig.... Also getting bears drunk, shaving their faces, putting them in dresses and then claiming they are pig-faced women in your freak show?  Is this all made up?  What on earth! 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcAj3lOyv3s 

I had no idea that this was actually a THING, I thought this commercial was SATIRE.  Thanks for making it funny!  




 I feel a sense of community.  I like that I can give my opinion on things and not have it dis-counted because of the way I look... no one knows how I look!  I'm less lonely, I laugh more, and I think about things I might never have considered before.  I love reddit!   




 Mostly trivia in very specific areas.  I don't even know any Warren Zevon fans in real life but if I do I'll be able to regale them with all kinds of chestnuts!  Or what about the birth order and sun signs of the entire Culkin family?  Do you want to know everything I know about the North American Bison.  Sit down, sir.  I'll help you with that.... Now serial killer trivia, I use that SOMETIMES.  Like twice a year.  On Reddit.  




 People whistling.  In all seriousness, I don't even whistle to myself when I'm alone.  That's how disgusting I find it to be.  It literally gives me a facial twitch.  




 I occasionally reply with "Who is this?" to texts I receive when I know damn well who it is.  




 I can actually count on one hand the moments I've been passive aggressive, and so they're both pretty good stories.

1. At my first job there was this girl who would never switch shifts with anyone EVER.  But she would go to the owner and have get the boss to make her the closer when she wanted extra money.  When she would steal this shift from me while I was actively working it, I would pour sweet and sour sauce on the tile floor, knowing she had to mop it and it was a bitch.

2. My old apartment had a HUGE window on one wall.  The neighbor would leave the porch light on all night, so I couldn't sleep well as it was bright, and my dogs would bark at things moving in the driveway.  I asked my husband to turn it off after an hour, but he didn't want to offend the neighbor.  One day when the light had been on all night and all of that day, I went out with a broom and very lightly tapped the lightbulb, breaking the filament in it, so it appeared to have burned out from being on all the time.  The damn thing was nine feet up, so it wasn't like they were going to change it.  Ahahaha!   




 I'd be living very differently.  I'd get a motorcycle and go to Sturgis and live in a new city every few years and I'd be out camping by myself all the time.   




 This is pretty geeky, but whatever.... I wore a sweater I had knitted to work and someone stopped me and said she "Would buy something like that.... no really!"  It was like.... I spent about $100 on this hand painted yarn, and it took several hundred hours to make and you're condescending to tell me you would buy something like it, no really?  Go away.  




 Oh dear, he missed his reflex check to catch it in time. :( 




 Where were you when I was a kid? :)  I like your reddit contributions, technobarry.  You're a cool cat.  




 Shut up!  Really?  I had no idea.... that's really weird to think about.... 80 year old octopuses.... I'm going to have to Google this. :) 




 I would watch the fuck out of Steve Buscemi's! :) 




 What if it's in octopus years?  (Yes, I just thought you were that funny on that other thread....I'm still crying from laughter.) 




 I just got my pre-ordered copy... it's actually pressed in Germany apparently.  




 This isn't about me and my child, but I have one of my mom's:

In 1992, my mom was married to a construction worker.  He took her with on an out of town job.  The hotel had a fabulous pool, and my mom really wanted to go swimming.  She didn't have a swimsuit.  Her husband said he would buy her one if she'd have sex with him that night.  She stipulated that she wanted tequila too if that's what needed to be done.  This is the night she conceived my youngest sister.  My sister was the consequence of a sex barter for a swimsuit.  I'm never to tell her on penalty of death.  




 I'm the assistant to a lady-CEO! :)  




 It sounds like you have anxiety.  Hey! Me too!  But I'm conventionally very successful, I have a house and a beautiful baby and a husband and a respectable career where I make more than the average American (and much more than the average woman).  

This has helped me some of the time, and when it doesn't initially, it does after I've had time to process further: From "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living" 1. Imagine the worst possible outcome of the issue at hand. 2. Accept that it could happen. 3. Think of ways to make the best of that worst possible outcome. 

As my former boss liked to say, don't get crushed by the rock, break the rock into smaller pieces and deal with them as you can. :) 




 State of the Union Address Given : Most hilarious jokes in the world made. 

Body: Lots of analytical text that boils down to how when you get beyond the hilarious jokes mixed in, the President just over analyzed several creative possible actions before dissolving into a tangent about how they are conscious this isn't helping.  Compassion and exasperation ensue.   




 Well, when I was four, my mom asked me what I wanted to be went I grew up.  I told her I wanted to be an artist.  She said "Artists don't get paid anything until they're dead."  So I kept my eyes open.  At five, I went to my first funeral and met a friendly mortician.  I wanted to be a mortician until I was, like, 14.  You can see I had a fucked sense of humor even then.  

I'm not a mortician, but I have succeeded in making something to the tune of $200 in my lifetime for art.  Look out!   




 I really, really hope that your retirement is magical.  That you do all those things you wanted to but never had the time or felt guilty doing.  (100% sincere) 




 It's misplaced, but it's well-meaning.  

I actually just had a moment of clarity thinking about this.  My mom and I were talking and she casually mentioned that my sister has just decided not to go in and get her prescription renewed for her birth control.  I was beyond dismayed.  She's 23, living in a rented house with a roommate, broke, and getting married in two months.  I want to tell her that she has her whole damn life to raise babies... that she should enjoy her husband and travel and live a reckless life before committing to a baby (I have a 6 month old with my husband, so I'm projecting.).  My mother pointed out to me that my sister was much better set up than she herself was when she had her first child (me).  And in thinking about it, my mom was homeless and my father was an abusive drug addict.  No one would advise pregnancy under those circumstances... but here I am, married, a homeowner, with a career, making more than the average American, and a mother to a beautiful baby... hell, I even have rescue dogs and volunteer with a hospice.... What am I worried about?    




 Actually, this brings up a great one for me: People always tell you that marriage is hard work.  I always imagined they meant that you will fight (and, hey, no problem! I can handle that) but the truth is probably a lot more subtle than that.  Sometimes you feel invisible and taken for granted.  You didn't enter into a partnership in which you will do everything together... you might have married someone who will never want to take that trip or whatever... you need to move beyond what you thought your life would be like.  This has been something of a rough, and altogether different type of hard than I was imagining when I heard about it. 




 Why exactly am I reacting this way?  It's important when you have anxiety to screen any knee jerk reactions to things for irrationality.  So if I'm putting off making a phone call to a stranger to get catering for an event, I need to recognize that's what I'm doing and talk myself into fixing it. 

It used to be "What have I done for my marriage today?"  




 Just rapping on some theory here: I think the only reason you would cheat emotionally would be because, right or wrong, you feel lonely or disconnected with the people in your life.  It's a human impulse to want to be understood and valued.  Unless you're just curious.  I could see that too. 




 Assimilation of Native Americans and Internment of Japanese-Americans. 




 Passive aggression.  Or expecting me to read your mind... we are adults, you use your words!!!!  




 Yes, some variation on this: Older = Smarter.  This is pure ego on my part, but I feel so cheated when I see through people who should, for all intents and purposes, be better than everyone else, but aren't.  Like when my former boss, the CEO of his third company, tried to manipulate me by relating that we both grew up poor and refused to be victims.... Like, I wanted him to be able to manipulate me without my knowing that was what he was doing... He was all parlor tricks!  Where is the magic!?  

I cried for a whole week straight when I started at a call center and realized that there were 50 year olds whose actual aspirations were to continue working their entry level jobs at $8.50/hr and pick on younger people.  Like, no!  Why did you stop growing at 14?! Why did you do that?  Be better!  




 Right, unless there is more to this scenario, it's perfectly responsible to have a life insurance plan.  I'm guessing that since you're going to grad school, you've already got a huge amount of debt.  If Canada is like the US in that regard, your parents could be saddled with that debt if, heaven forbid, anything should happen to you.  I have taken out term life insurance on my husband (in addition to the insurance I have on myself) because we have a mortgage and an infant child.  If anything happened to either of us, I wouldn't want my child to lose her home as well as a parent.  Life insurance is just good planning. :) 




 Quite right, we always make time for the things that are truly important to us.  I sometimes think that I should feel guilty for working full time and then volunteering for six hours at a hospice one day of the weekend, but then I have to remind myself that what I'm doing is making my headspace better so that when I'm with my daughter, I'm the best I can be.  




 Unfortunately, I don't think it will, you see he had to have a six month probationary period where he had to drive with another licensed driver, but he's married to one... So it wasn't an issue. Initially learning is going to be the tricky part, but I'm sure you could use online videos for the theory of it... Do you think you could maybe offer carpooling? Then in theory, a licensed driver would come to your house, and you would drive the two of you to a location like a school or shop? Or maybe you could look into community education? I took what we call "Behind the wheels" with an instructor that I paid.  




 Can you tell us what state you live in?  The laws and guidelines vary greatly from state to state.  If not, just say so and I can still help by relaying how my husband got his license at 38. :) 




 Please, don't take this as nay-saying, but I'd feel guilty if I didn't mention that in the time I was using the Nuvaring, I suffered recurrent yeast infections.  This is not uncommon (14% of women experience it as a side effect according to Google).  I never had this problem prior to the Nuvaring, and I was on it at age 24.  I didn't ever have trouble with it coming out on accident, like the other posters, I took it out during intercourse... it was uncomfortable to leave in during. 




 Nobody has recommended boric acid yet.  Please Google it before writing it off; this has been immensely helpful to me.  I started getting recurrent infections after using the Nuvaring, even after I switched birth control methods.  A yeast infection has an 80% chance of recurrence, so using anti-biotics is really just a risky band-aid that comes with a hefty medical bill after.  I got 00 size gel caps off of Amazon and a bottle of powdered boric acid.  If I have an infection, I insert two capsules a day (one in the morning, one at night) vaginally.  If you choose to do this, you'll want to use a panty liner.  I also do just a half gel cap after my period or after intercourse just to be safe.  I also use an oral probiotic: Acidophilus.  I get that at Wal-Greens.  I hope things get better for you!     




 Hmmm. You just described the first feature of "Family Portraits: A Trilogy of America." 









 This has helped me some of the time, and when it doesn't initially, it does after I've had time to process further: From "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living" 1. Imagine the worst possible outcome of the issue at hand.  2. Accept that it could happen.  3. Think of ways to make the best of that worst possible outcome.  

After the sheer hell that was my failure at breastfeeding followed by months of exclusive pumping that lead to three bouts of mastitis and finally Reynauld's syndrome of the nipples, I had to accept that I was going to have to give up.  This process, writing down that I would have more time with my family, get more sleep, feel less pain, focus more on my baby, be happier, etc, helped me move beyond what seemed at first a crushing failure.  This is a major example of when I used this, but as a person who struggles with anxiety about pretty much everything, you can use it to keep things in perspective.  

People with anxiety tend to be pretty capable when they know what is coming so thinking "If the meter runs out and I get a ticket, I know I can map the way to court house and that I can afford the ticket.  It will be annoying, but it is not the end of the world," can make a big difference. 

Good luck... in reading through your Reddit contributions, you seem like a warm, funny, and intelligent lady.  I'm sure you'll figure things out.  I believe in you!  




 The fact that you down voted only the reply where I wrongly accused you of being obtuse makes me love you a little bit.  I'm sorry. (I'm being 100% sincere.) 




 Because I also work in a field where I'm stuck using a stupid style guide and it's updated all the time.  I do think you're being a bit obtuse here, my point still stands, and in fact, you're making it very more to the point... none of it is consistent or organic!   




 I'm sure they've since been updated.  "Iris" isn't plural, but "Adams" is! 




 I didn't go, just because I'd gone in 11th grade, so what was the point?  This along with my decision to not go to the all-night grad party or the graduation dinner or the Sno-Ball my senior year are things I regret on a moderate level now.  The truth is that the business of being young is incredibly fleeting, and you never get to go back and do those things again.  Even if they are terrible, they make for even better stories years later.  I spent a lot of my teenage years trying to be a little adult, and that is sad because I'll be an adult for the rest of my life.... you can only be young and do these things now.   




 The rules are not consistent.  "Mary's" is possessive, "Iris's" is correct, but "Iris'" isn't, even though "the cars'" would be if you mean more than one car that possesses something... meanwhile "it's" can only be "it is," with "its" being possessive, being at odds with everything I just wrote out for you above.  It is any wonder at all that people get confused?     




 You know what I love about this question?  It assumes that people don't have a 'type,' that they don't act like John Wayne Gacy and only pick victims that are tall, thin, and have shaggy blond hair.  




 Lack of "whole foods" meaning food that hasn't been chemically modified or otherwise messed with.  Putting a damn window in a chicken coop doesn't make the chickens in it "free range."  There is a reason why we have so many dietary issues in the US.  30+ flavors of pop tarts doesn't help. 




 I liked the graphic novel "Black Hole" by Charles Burns.  




 And even the reason we have the right to bear arms! 




 Every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back I hope you feel it. 




 This is what I'm talking about!!!! THAT IS IRONIC.  It's ironic!  Why, why would you assume there would be a non-smoking rule in the smoking room?  That is the opposite of what you would expect!  




 How about things we have to see often:

"Just in case you thought Memorial Day was about barbecues" - Oh yeah, I totally have met that person who talks about today as national hotdog day.  That's a thing that happens! /sarcasm

"Why don't we have White History Month?" - I'm sorry, what do you think we're studying the other 11 months of the year?

"It's time we stopped apologizing for being American." - The person going door to door in Iowa demanding you drag our great nation through the mud has failed to come to my house.

"Like if you support drug testing for food stamps" - Guess what! Drug dealers don't typically accept food stamps for drugs, but you know who does take food stamps? Grocery stores. You can use the food stamps to feed the children who didn't ask to be born to the drug addicts.  You know, the ones whose food money was spent on drugs. 




 You know, I thought the big dissension about this song was very presumptuous.  The argument that things were "unfortunate" instead of "ironic" assumes that she didn't expect an opposite outcome.  I don't think it's a stretch to assume your wedding day would be perfect, or that on a single plane ride, you would be safe.  Am I crazy? 




 Just follow their sentence that ended in "sir" with a soft, non-aggressive "ma'am."  You know, correct them in a quiet sort of way.  Unless they're totally not listening, they'll apologize profusely.  I've got a bit of experience with this having done phone work. I hope this helps you. :) 




 Respond in a nearly inaudible voice so that if they want to hear what you have to say, they have to pipe the fuck down. ;)

I'd make it a rule not to acknowledge behavior you don't appreciate.  




 "Lucky Now" by Ryan Adams.  Why did he choose to not repeat the chorus after the last verse?  I love that song, but at 2 minutes and 30 odd seconds, you can't put it on repeat. :) 




 It is a word that can be applied to denote a situation that has opposite outcome of what one would expect.  




 I think, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you read my response as the fear being my own.  It is not.  One thing I'm learning is that people are conscious of their own memory loss and disconcerted by it.  I don't fear my own death or degenerative brain disorder.  I'm acting to try to alleviate the pressure these patients feel to remember things.  They don't really need to bother.  It's irrelevant.    




 Cinnamon Rolls and Chili! :) 
























 Well, I'm not bald, but my husband is.  

When I was 20 weeks pregnant, we got one of those 3-D ultrasound photos of our unborn daughter.  She already very clearly had my husband's nose.  When I would show it to people, I would say proudly "She already looks just like her daddy," and more than one person, totally serious mind you, would say "Oh, because she's bald?"

Guys.  Come on.  He shaves his head.  It's not a genetic trait.  She came out with a Mohawk, incase you were curious.  




 I collect a certain set of Christmas tree ornaments.  I also keep track of a bunch of silly little details on them (release year, amount paid, place procured, release number, etc) in an Excel spreadsheet.  I mentioned this spreadsheet in a job interview.  Obviously I was just about laughed out of the room, but they still offered me the job.  Even at six months pregnant. 




 That Tiefling they make you party with in Neverwinter Nights 2.  I can't remember her stupid name.   




 A lot of court issued documents are public property and some states have begun putting them on the internet.  If you know someone's name and date of birth, you can find things that can potentially lead you to other things.  I had the most luck with tracking down things like divorce papers and death certificates to give me locations that I then used to check archived obituaries for.  Obits list survivors.  You can look up these survivors' phone number and get leads.  




 Aww, thank you Sunshiny Cloud!  I'm glad things got better for you!  You're a very kind person, your kids are lucky to have you. :)   




 "it will take about two years to get back on track"

I'm so grateful to you I have tears in my eyes.  Thank you so much.  Really.  Thank you.  




 No, not yet.  My OB decided to do a pap at my two month post-natal appointment, so my insurance doesn't cover another well-woman until 2016.  I didn't even think about it at the time!  Do you think it's serious enough that I should just pony up out of pocket?  (I've got high deductible insurance.) Thank you for the response. :) 




 Hello,

My daughter is now seven months old, but I'm still dealing with a lot of the physical symptoms from my pregnancy. The most annoying one is the carpal tunnel. I've lost all my baby weight, why are my arms and hands still hurting? Will they never go back to normal? 

I'm also struggling with "baby-brain" before I would make mistakes like having to say "wanting to help because we're all people" instead of "compassion," which makes sense, but these days, I go to type "beautiful" and end up typing "people!" What gives?!

I've also still go a lot of pain down there. I gave birth naturally and it took them an hour to stitch me back up. I've healed, obviously, but the scar tissue hurts during intercourse... will it ever go away?

This is TMI (like most of the things in this post, sorry!) but what about hemorrhoids? I'm never constipated, but they just won't go away.

Ladies, does it get better or do we just sort of forget what it was like before and move on?

Thank you for your time and responses. :) 
 




 http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1367997005/733/8648733.jpg I got you a link!  




 It's Georgie!  I'm a girl. Ahahaha.  




 To be 100% honest, it's not their concern.  If they were a better fit, they would be doing it.  If they're just criticizing with no aspirations, then the manager should consider it to be noise so long as they accept that valid points may be made that contribute to personal or professional betterment.  But the truth is that a lot of times subordinates are just bored and looking for things to get upset with.  If someone has a legitimate concern, to reiterate what I said, they need to bring it to their manager.  If the manager fails to act, go above them.  It's on that next tier to decide who is qualified and who is not.  




 Maybe I clicked through your username.... maybe I did.  It's okay, though, all I did was upvote some of your more inane comments.  I consent to a similar stalking act if you feel so inclined. ;)

Sorry that board harshed your mellow, man.  




 Did you die tho?

Just kidding.  I'm loving your contributions.  The Double Double one made me spit out my soda at my desk. XD 




 Two Times:

1) You've been very explicit about your issues, but they are blowing you off.

2) It's an issue of a sensitive subject (e.g. sexual in nature) that involves them.  




 Lost in Translation.  Pretty much every scene he filmed for the whiskey commercial was priceless.  When he acted in slow motion, his goofy impression of Roger Moore, all of it.  So silly.   




 Let me start by saying that you're doing a great job.  These first few weeks are one of the strangest times of your life and you're expected to handle them on little or no sleep with a broken and recovering body.  You're so strong and you're doing such a good job.

Now let's talk about this sleep thing.  You have some valid complaints here, but you seem like a very practical and reasonable person who knows that some times you just have to let things slide.  I want you to examine why you're upset when you get upset.  Do you feel that a specific remark is insinuating that you're not working hard enough?  That you're not competent in his eyes?  It's good to understand why we feel what we feel because understanding allows us the chance to recognize when we are overreacting or being unreasonable.  This has nothing to do with you, personally, it's just human nature!  The thing is that a lack of sleep make a mountain out of a molehill.  We're more irritable and we don't feel well, that makes things seem worse.  I love that you said you don't get frustrated with your baby, but the truth is that frustration is normal, you might be putting it somewhere else, wrong or right.  Don't feel bad about it, just think about it.

Now the most important thing here is to communicate.  If he is making you feel like he thinks you are a bad mother, you should say so in a way that is matter-of-fact and as unemotional as possible.  A lot of times people just don't realize that what they're saying is hurting us.  I want you to think about something.  How often in your life have you said something with the specific intention of hurting another person?  Probably never, right?  Other people are usually no different.  If he is hurting you, he's probably not doing it intentionally, but he still needs to know how he's making you feel. 

His overreaction to the baby's perceived health problems is borne out of love, I think you know that because you are very observant.  If he's that enamored of your little man, you might just be able to convince him to go show him off.  My area hospital has pre-natal classes that are just for fathers.  These classes pair up with the new-father support group and their babies.  Daddy might just need some time with other guys who are going through the same thing, validate those feelings, and then relax.  I know we want to be all things for our partners, but sometimes we relate best to members of our own sex, you know?

This little stuff you're talking about that bothers you, it's time to employ pragmatism.  If he is questioning how you are doing something, in a nice, calm, non-emotional way, explain exactly why you are doing it.  If he suggests a different way, ask him to explain (nicely, don't confront) why he thinks that way is the best, to explain it.  If he is a man with a plan or someone who likes to know how things work, this might just short-circuit a heated situation.  

I'm sorry that you're having trouble and feeling lousy, but I'm SO PROUD of you for asking for help.  Not only just asking, but you clearly want to do what is best.  You're going to be a wonderful, wonderful example to your little person.  You're rational, caring, have a good perspective, question things that should be questioned, and most of all, you want the very best for everyone involved.  When you come from that place, you're the very best kind of caretaker.      




 Wow, now you're swearing at me.  I've been nothing but civil to you.  I apologize in advance for how angry this is probably going to make you, because it is never my intention to make someone feel bad, but I am choosing not to give a moment more of my energy.  Take care.   




 1) I was going to reassure you that attire is a lot less strict these days, but man, if it's Baptist and a small town in Texas, you should probably ask someone you know for clothes to borrow or buy something. It's a lot more normal than you might think to borrow funeral attire.  Lots of people don't have anything to wear to a funeral.

2) There are two parts that happen when a person passes away.  The visitation and the actual funeral.  The visitation is the viewing of the body.  It's usually in the funeral home itself, although in old fashioned places, it can be at a family home.  There are usually prayers recited to the group and then people go up and talk about the deceased.  It's a low pressure deal.  The funeral itself is where you go to the grave site and bury the person if that is what's happening.  Typically a man of the church will be there to say a prayer, but, again, it's not a high pressure thing you participate in.  You just stand there with your head down.

3) Totally not tacky.  I'm sure your family would love to see them.  I'd add a nostalgic little blurb about what a good memory it was if you're so inclined.  




 I'm glad I could help.  Thank you for thanking me!  It made me feel accomplished. :) 




 What I did was to put Former before their job title and company, so the reviewer would understand the connection.  If they want to know about current situation, they can ask when they call.  I formatted my line items like this:

*First Name Last Name* / Former *job title here* - *former company name* / Relationship to me (e.g. Past Direct Supervisor) / *Phone number with area code* 




 I simply don't like exercises in futility. I have rationale, but why do you deserve to know what it is?  I don't owe you an explanation.  I know in my heart that I don't believe a single thing you've accused me of thinking about men.  You can't convince me that I do.  I likely can't convince you that I don't.  So what's the point?  I kind of doubt that you have one. 

As an aside, if you really want my attention, you don't have to be a bully to get it.    




 As a companion to my response to your other question, I'd still rather be short.  I can get into spaces most people can't, I'm more resourceful, I occasionally get out of doing things I don't really want to do, I look adorable at my height, while at 5'3" I would probably be nothing remarkable.  

And I would totally date a boy who was short.  I happen to be married to someone who is 6'1.5" but let me tell you, it's pretty much just awkward in every way.  Our wedding pictures are hilarious.  My biggest (ho ho) crushes are right around 5'5". 

Edit: Although thinking about it further, I'm pretty devil may care... being 6'2" as a woman would be pretty cool insofar as it fits my personality.  I think if I were very tall, I'd be braver.  I'd still date shorter men though.  Long hair, don't care. 
 




 I'm not quite five feet tall. 

People take this as a license to rest their forearms on my shoulder as a joke.  They say things like "How's the weather down there?" which they think is funny and original but is not.  They ask me stupid things like if I'm turned away at amusement parks (no, dumbass, I'm not 4'5") and how I put pillowcases on pillows.  

The night I got married, I went out for supper with my husband, his step sister, and her husband.  I was 24, the hostess was 19 at the very most.  She said "So three adults and one child?"  Another time, while I was visibly pregnant, and 27, I went out to dinner with the CEO of my then company to a place called "Shula's."  Like Don Shula.  They brought me a menu that was printed on a regulation sized football.  My boss got a paper menu.  Yes, at six months pregnant, they STILL thought I needed a kids menu.  I am almost 30.  I have crows feet.  Are you even paying attention!?   




 What would be an acceptable answer to you? 




 I recalibrated the counterweight and set it according to your directive about the anti-skate matching the counterweight setting. I'm still having the same trouble. It is very intermittent. Like the same distance into multiple records, but not a constant issue, track three is bad, track five is terrible, track four sounds fine.... I might just need to bring it in for repairs. I'm out of my depth.  




 I'm not actually certain that the counterweight is right... it was already installed on my unit.  I'll try taking it off and putting it back on according to the instructions to be sure.  Thank you for the help.  I would have assumed that the settings on it were accurate rather than that the part might be on wrong so the settings mean nothing.  




 Can you give us any more background?  Is his mother in pain?  Is he not getting enough to eat?  Is he not interested?  Is he detaching?  What exactly seems to be the trouble here?  




 I'm not sure if you're actually asking me or just making a point, but to err on the side of optimism, no, it told me to set the counterweight at 2.  

I've looked up anti-skate and what I'm getting is that everyone has an opinion on it and I probably need some sort of test record to set it? 




 What exactly are you looking for here?  




 What is anti-skate?  Like I know where the setting is, but what does it do?  What should I be listening for it to change?  I have a 0 - 3 for that one.  My manual doesn't explain what it does, it just tells me to set it at 0.  




 How often do you ever say anything with the explicit intention of hurting someone's feelings?  I bet it's almost never if not never period.  The truth is that even the most hurtful people we have to deal with on a daily basis rarely intend to hurt us, they're just not cognizant of how they really come across.  If you feel attacked, take a moment to think if there is any possible positive place that the comment could come from.  If you can't think of any, just say in a curious, open kind of voice "I'm not sure what you mean, can you elaborate?"  If they really are being an asshole, at that point they'll get all red and sputtery and you'll come out on top.  I doubt that scenario will play out, though.  People are seriously about 10x more harmless than we can ever imagine.  




 I went ahead and did it three separate times just in case I was accidentally twisting it somehow... it's still too slow.  Could it be the pressure setting?  




 No, it's definitely the player.... My brand new Neil Young album played fine on my last set-up and it's all distorted and slow on this one, just the same as the other record, which was also brand new. :-/ 




 The third track is too slow, I'm sorry, I should have specified.  I haven't tried a different record... I'll go do that now and report directly back!  




 Hello, thanks for the fast response!  I just went in and tried it and it is the same. 




 Hello /r/vinyl ;
I got my second-hand Teac TN-300 in the mail today.  I don't have any experience with turntables, but I think the belt needs to be replaced on this one.  The first track on the record sounds fine, but when I get to the second it's intermittently the wrong speed, and the third is unlistenable... I've tried Google and looking through the Amazon reviews and the Teac website but I can't find any information on replacement parts....

Can someone tell me what kind of belt and stylus I should get for this turntable?  

I apologize in advance if these are ridiculous questions. I'm really lost! 




 Here you go, friend: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice#Ice_harvesting :) 




 While I think responding to you will probably only encourage this type of behavior, I'll take the time to point out that it was by merit of my action, a forward suggestion to contact a stranger about personal issues, that prompted my comment.  It was meant as a reassurance.  It wasn't meant as a condemnation of men in general, but a recommendation on why I might be able to help.  I'm very sorry that you took offense to my remark to the point that you needed to go to the trouble of making an account just to catch me out, but you only need go through my comment history to see that I'm interested in helping other human beings.  I'm not a man-hater.  Hopefully this susses things and you move along back to your main account.  




 I'm actually really flattered someone cares so much about me that they made an account just to send me weird replies from though.... Oh reddit, you magical place, you. :)  




 I'm not sure why this is a reply to me, man. I don't believe that at all!  




 It's nice man!  I like the leaves and the yard too!  And the color of your t-shirt is a great color with everything else.  Nice picture. :) 




 This is interesting to me.  My husband once told me that he never suggests any solutions to my problems because he simply assumes that anything he could come up with would be something I already thought of myself.  He's rather missing the point (which I've told him)... it's the act of making an effort that matters, not the outcome.  It's the same with this, the act of trusting someone enough to tell them what you really feel.  From your response, you're either someone with anxiety (like me) or you're with someone who isn't good to you.  In either case, I'm sorry that things aren't easier for you, and I hope they get better some day.  




 I think that it is infinitely more responsible than protesting abortion by carrying giant photos of aborted fetuses in public where children can see them and be scarred for life.  Too much?

I'm big on freedom of speech.  I'm big on my country.  I'm also big on personal responsibility.  Yes, I understand that it is your right to protest with photos of gore.  But should you?  Does it not contradict your whole position?  

I LOVE America.  I'm SO PROUD to be an American.  Really.  While I will be the first one up and I will sing every damn word of the Star Spangled Banner, I will not recite the pledge of allegiance.  I find worship of an inanimate object to be fascist.  And I love that because I am an American, I can talk about this with you all.  I am only too aware that my freedom has come at a cost, and so not exercising those freedoms is a crime.

Since I'm on the soapbox, vote folks.  It's important.    




 PM me if you ever want to talk.  I promise I'm not a creepy old man.  Just a girl who is close to 30 and knows what it is like to be in a problematic marriage.  




 I'm sorry. :( 




 Okay, I think I've been waiting for almost 15 years to see someone ask about this so I can say:

All or Nothing.

I have seen All or Nothing.  It has no plot, you can't understand a single thing they're saying without the captions, it's depressing, and confusing.  But sometimes I see the preview again, and it is literally such a good trailer that I think to myself... Maybe I just didn't get it the first go round.  Maybe I should see it again.

 I have a friend who lives half the way down the world from me.  

He refuses to believe that we have "not for profit" banks here (meaning a credit union).

He also refuses to believe anything about the phenomenon of Ice Harvesting. 

I've proven both things, but as he says "I believe it, but it's bullshit." 




 I don't think it has anything to do with luck, except in the way one might say our souls are placed into specific bodies, but I actually don't believe in souls.  

I think childbirth is one of those things that hasn't really been researched in the way it should be.  For example, while doctors know what to give you to induce labor, they actually have no idea what it is in our bodies that sends us into it.  Why don't they know this yet? 




 Virtual Reality by RedRover... or anything by RedRover really.... but this one is about LadyDevimon tricking the girls from 02 Digimon into entering a virtual reality with their Digimon and forcing them into about ten odd combinations of sexual assault on her and each other.    




 Stop.  Are you being serious?!

Edit: I actually don't want to know. 




 Stuffed bell peppers are too much of a pain in the ass to make unless you're making a ton of them... I'd do that!  And I'd freeze the extras. :) 




 I've got a new theme song for you : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AhKO4NXJA4

Apparently it is not so weird of a phenom that it prevented Ryan Adams from singing about it on what is arguably one of the best country albums ever written.  




 Mac, c'mon, man.  What's that first word in my reply? 




 Typically in America no "whole food" is taxed, meaning ingredients such as vegetables or oatmeal or meat.  It's only prepared and processed things that are non-essential that are taxed, like soda, chips, and fast food. 




 I like to use it in conjunction with holiday weekends.  For instance in America, Christmas is on a Friday and New Years is the following Friday.  I'd take off M-R of New years week for sure... and I'd ask for it now.  You get ten days for the price of four!   




 Oh no, you misunderstood my question, but also gave me the answer.  I mean there, because you said Tampons were, pads were not, so what are cups?  Thanks for the info, this is useless trivia I'm sure I can entertain someone with.  :) 




 Seriously though, can you let me know if the Diva Cup is taxed?  Now I'm actually curious.  




 Listen, you can't hold back your diva power when you are a stripper.... so you use le Diva Cup.  This is 101 stuff.  Cancel the revolt!  Mort le Revolution!  




 Any question whatsoever I might post in /r/vinyl 

Talk about an intimidating group.  




 Here in America, prepared food is taxed (le Cheeseburger) but grocery items (le broccoli) are not.  Tampons are the fast food of feminine products.  Off-the-cuff-theory-Thursday! Hey!  




 Snowtown 




 I'm sorry you've upset yourself so much by thinking about this... it's pretty simple, so don't worry further: It's a human survival trait to recommend ourselves to others by mimicking their facial expressions.  They see us smile, they become conscious of their ability to manipulate their facial muscles (you can stick your tongue out and raise your eyebrows at a newborn, and they will mimic you, but it is subconscious), and then they smile to recommend themselves to you.  Smiling feels good because it releases endorphins.  So they keep doing it. :) 




 Kismet.  You stop that.  I'm looking at you, alternative rock band HURT.  




 My OLD apartment.  Funny thing.  The lightbulbs kept burning out there.... So we moved.  




 Yes, your first sentence is exactly what I'm saying. 




 Team Dakota Regular 4ever.  (Yes, I'm trolling, but in a fond sort of way that I hope is endearing rather than enraging.) 




 Because if you use your caps lock and italicize it, it looks like the distinctive handwritten font used in 1960's era comics.  We need this for our satire.  




 I feel very flattered by this and some what self conscious since I'm laughing alone in my office like a crazy person.   




 Honey, the very worst thing that can happen to you is that you say the words "You know what?  That's a great question.  I'm not sure about that, but I would like to ask my supervisor.  Would you mind holding?"

I've been on every level of a call center from agent to business development.  It really is that simple. 

Your anxiety is totally normal for anyone that is starting a new job.  You will learn, and because you're so concerned about doing a good job, you will probably become a shining example faster than you think.

Good luck!  I believe in you!  




 If I weren't married, we'd be getting married.  To each other.  




 This is actually pretty simple: Beer tastes good.  Good gin also tastes good.  People don't necessarily drink to get drunk. 

It is an easy thing to feel happy in an altered state.  The hard thing is to be happy when you're just yourself.  To be able to deal with things that are uncomfortable or boring or upsetting without reaching for some crutch. 




 Thank you for telling me how you feel.  I will endeavor to use more descriptors if you ever ask me how I am and it is my impulse to say "fine." 3 




 Okay, now I have to confess the one passive aggressive thing I did that I'm, like, super proud of, indulge me, okay?: 

My old apartment had a HUGE window on one wall. The neighbor would leave the porch light on all night, so I couldn't sleep well as it was bright, and my dogs would bark at things moving in the driveway. I asked my husband to turn it off after an hour, but he didn't want to offend the neighbor. One day when the light had been on all night and all of that day, I went out with a broom and very lightly tapped the lightbulb, breaking the filament in it, so it appeared to have burned out from being on all the time. The damn thing was nine feet up, so it wasn't like they were going to change it. Ahahaha!  




 I hate to break it to you, but some of us women (like me) operate in a typical male fashion where we just say what we mean when we feel like it.  And some men are insufferably passive aggressive.  We're rarely matched with two of the same kind. ;)

If I tell you I'm fine, I actually mean I'm in a neutral place between "really great" and "not so great."  I'm telling you the truth.   




 I have inane stories for all occasions, but here is one to humor you:

My mother planted a weeping maple in our yard.  As the name suggests, the leaves hang downward on it like it is weeping.  About four months passed with this tree in our yard, and my sister came in and said, 100% serious mind you, "Mom, I think your tree is sick."  I have about 10 more stories like this between my two sisters.  




 Giving birth.  They tell you the first time it'll be 20+ hours of labor and more painful than you can imagine and that you'll probably end up needing medical intervention at some point.

I was in labor for 11 hours, pushed for 45 minutes, no drugs.  They did spend an hour stitching me back up, but I was pretty much in shock at that point, so all I remember is how I wanted to put my legs down, so what is taking so long.  All in all, I was thinking it would be MUCH WORSE.  




 Do Canadians have birth certificates?  In America, we have our fathers' names on them, linking their government identifier to ours.  Also in America, we sometimes have to bring in a birth certificate as proof of our citizenship with other things.  This might be a way to get your hands on it... 

My situation isn't exactly like yours, but my father was never a part of my life, and then when I was 12, we got word that he had passed away.  When I was 21, I managed to get ahold of his ashes without having met or interacted with anyone on that side of the family myself.  I had his name and I dug into old obituaries.  The obits list survivors which gave me leads that led to other leads on who to find contact information for. 

Good luck!  




 "A personal point of pride for me is my discipline.  I am organized and manage my time well.  While I work well in a team, independently I can be counted upon to hold myself to a standard of excellence.  I know that I would be an asset to your company, and you only need speak with me in person to see how passionate I am."  




 Talk about their feelings.  Like I get that you don't tend to feel things about petty issues, but my goodness, you must feel some things some times.... why are you just waiting for me to be able to intuit what you're thinking?  It drives me crazy that there are probably things I need to work on but because we never talk about what annoys you or what hurts you, I'll never be able to examine and grow into a better partner.   




 I'm not sure... but there is actually a whole section on the Argentina Wikipedia page about whether Arggies are actually white.  It's very weird.  




 This was a lyrical miracle.  




 I am younger.  And about a foot shorter.  I mean, I'm pretty smart, but how would she know that?  It may be because I am the direct report of the CEO who is also her immediate supervisor, but c'mon... I'm just a secretary!  I'm hardly relevant!  




 I don't know how much of this is a pretty girl problem, since I suspect it is just a short, young girl problem, but when I worked at Gamestop, I would specifically ask guys if they had any questions, they would tell me no, and then immediately make a bee-line to my male co-workers and proceed to ask them things.  

More to the point of what you're talking about here, at my current job, I've incurred a bit of pointless one-sided rivalry with one of the top level ladies.  We're decently close in age.  She was asking co-workers I went to high school with ten years ago what they remembered about me.  She never allows me to do the simple things my predecessor did for her.  She refuses to make eye contact.  She also criticizes my snack choices at board meetings to her co-workers.  I have no idea why she cares about me.  She's got three degrees, I'm in a no-ladder position, and I'm pretty nice/helpful/competent.  I think some women just tend to struggle with the idea that building someone up doesn't detract from your own merit.  It's too bad.  Building people up feels so much better.   




 We just want to drink NOS and watch Tokyo Drift in peace.  




 This isn't a television commercial, but we have two super morbid radio ads up here in MN.  One is about boat safety and we get to hear someone drown while someone narrates what is happening in that person's body as they are drowning.  The other is about going through a windshield in a car accident and what exactly is damaged and how in your body.  Both pretty unnecessary.  To add stress to dismay, the car accident one also features sirens.  So you flinch and think you're being pulled over. :-/ 




 I love the original flavor of NOS.  They even have a great website where you can put in your location and they have distributor data that tells you WHAT FLAVORS the stores carry!  The Loaded Cherry flavor is pretty awesome too.  




 If you're comfortable, can you tell me what sort of job you're applying for?  What you've got here is painfully generic and not specific to any one type of work... here is an example of a similar paragraph I wrote for my sister when she was applying as a bank teller:

I am a very service minded individual who takes pride in being able to identify the needs of others and to make sure that they are taken care of.  I am energetic, outgoing, and positive.  I love being able to improve someones day and to make people laugh.  I feel that I would be a great addition to your organization.
 




 Well, you're looking at the difference here between making an open ended statement like "Sorry, I really don't want to intrude, it's just that I've been having trouble sleeping, would you mind keeping it down at 12am," which while perfectly reasonable could still backfire on you, and a statement where you're insinuating your roommate should live his life the way you want him to "Would you mind going out instead of being here after 12pm sometimes?"  

All criticism usually ends in defensiveness no matter how careful we are with people, it's just human nature.  To be more specific though, if her husband is still hanging about and they're getting a divorce, your roommate going over there could result in him being assaulted.... who needs that on their conscience....? Even if he didn't take your advice, he'd probably think you're a bit off suggesting it.  I'd be very scared to run into a soon-to-be ex husband as a man.

I hope this didn't come off as condescending.  I swear, I'm trying to help in good will. :)  




 About a month ago or a month ago?  Most employers have a 30 day grace period in which either party may terminate your employment contract at any time. :)

Of course, you need to be respectful and grateful and apologetic.  Life happens, but if you go above and beyond to make it clear that you are only doing what you feel you must and feel very guilty about it all, they will likely harbor no ill will.  




 If you've already decided that you don't really want to mention it, you can take the path of least resistance.  I have this at my house, and it works great, you just need to make sure you put it in a central location in the room... it doesn't overpower noise, it scatters it.  It just sounds like a box fan: http://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Easy-Sound-Conditioner-Machine/dp/B00GFSF402/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1432823103 sr=8-1 keywords=white+noise+machine 




 Well, like so many things, this isn't something that someone can do for you.... make you want to live.  You have to want it yourself.  

I'm a huge believer in choosing things.  Deciding in my head and heart that I'm going to do something and leave no room for an alternative.  Being stubborn and having high level anxiety (so a fear of failure in any form) pretty much guarantees that I'll follow through.

You've said that you can't allow yourself to die and that you feel guilty for even considering it because of your parents.  It sounds like to me that a pragmatist would have grounds to see the opportunity to make a choice here.

If you don't care about yourself then give yourself over to the betterment of things.  Yes, you could choose to die, but that's selfish and will probably only guarantee that your parents will divorce at the very least, or kill themselves at the very worst. (Source: http://lighthaiti.org/the-connection-between-divorce-and-death-of-a-child.html)  That's a negative on a negative and doesn't make sense.  Instead, you should make yourself work to better things, to make life beautiful for people who can enjoy it.  I recommend volunteering for a hospice.  Many people are dying and have no family to be there with them at the end.  They are scared and they are lonely.  Government regulation mandates that 5% of all hours in hospice come from unpaid companions.  Maybe you should look into it.  




 I've actually (what a coincidence!) got to go to bed myself.... so just in case you think I might be on to something, here is a Mayo Clinic link for you... don't worry, it's not a big deal, just a blood test and some cheap pills: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothyroidism/basics/definition/con-20021179 




 I've got a book suggestion for you: "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living" by Dale Carnegie.  You need to learn how to live in day-tight compartments as Dale says.  Good luck!   




 Have you ever had your thyroid tested?  This isn't something the doctor will do unless they suspect there is a need.  If you haven't had one, and you can't afford to go right now, look in the mirror, thyroid issues will typically leave a physical clue on your neck... it will look like you have a slightly puffy collar... almost like you have a hair tied under your chin and another just above your collarbones.

 Madeline Albright!  Prague Winter was amazing!  :) 




 Could he possibly move on ahead of you?  Set things up so you can join him in a few months? 




 Have you ever invited this friend to do something in the city with you?  

You seem like a pragmatist; so I'm sure you know the answer here: Is this person someone you like enough to do stuff that's not your favorite with? If they are, compromise, say something like "Since you're always dragging me out into the woods, I figured this weekend I could lure you out for a steak and some gin here in civilization. :)" (the smiley is so you don't sound bitter when you say it)

We all have to do things we don't like for people we really like. Right now I'm stuck in the 80 degree car while my husband refuses to turn on the a/c, listening to music I don't like, and having to pretend that I care the Sox lost to the Twins today. But tonight he'll have to pretend he's not annoyed when I leave him with the baby and read in bed for a half hour. That's life! :) 




 Where you go to college isn't going to have much of an impact on who takes you on as a game warden, so if you really want to live in Maine, going to school there might be the perfect way to ensure you get a couple years in.  I mean, it's beautiful country... But there are so many beautiful places in these here United States.  You should see Oregon and Montana and Virginia State, and hell, even Northern Minnesota.  :) 




 Most states have job boards that you can sort by profession, here is the one for Maine: http://www.maine.gov/portal/employment/jobs.html

You can also check out the IFW website: http://www.maine.gov/ifw/warden_service/index.html

Here in other parts of the world, we call it the DNR or Department of Natural Resources... took me a minute to find the equivalent in Maine.  Hope this helps! :)  




 Hello.  I'm sorry that you're having such a tough time.  You seem like a hard worker who really cares about her family.  Have you looked into any housing programs in your state?  Here in MN we have a thing called 1 Roof.  If you meet a certain income guideline, you can just take a class on homeownership and prove that you can keep $1000 in your bank account for one month, and then you can get a mortgage without having to make a down payment.  They even have companion programs for if you need to do home repairs.  My advice is to look into what government assistance programs are in your area.  A lot of places also offer free financial planning assistance, so if you're struggling to budget, you can educate yourself.  I'm not sure if any of this will help you, but I hope that it does!   




 This person knows their stuff, inevitably when you are actually up there, your nerves will cause you to speak more quickly than you did when you practiced.  If you keep this in mind, you'll be able to maintain pace. :)  
























 In June of 2014 I was on the verge of needing medication to cope with job anxiety.  I was six months pregnant.  It was hot outside.  My former company forced me to go on two last business trips before I left for good in August.  I was salaried and working about 56 hours a week.  I'm really glad it's not June of 2014.  




 OMG... the parallels!  I read and knit... My husband shaves his head, right?  I joked that he was basically Nostferatu once... He did not like that at all.  Ahahaha, this is such a small world.  Thank you for the comment. 3   




 Someone is going to click on this and wonder what the hell happened.  Ahahaha.  




 I try to be a good wife.  I pre-ordered [this](http://store.misfit.com/products/bolt?gclid=CjwKEAjwqLWrBRC-_OaG-IfL0kASJAAbzKsVbpRky11625fR9yZLmpV-PYcJf4H17n_Ui0fOQ2pUhRoC-dvw_wcB) for him for his birthday... I think it was the most successful gift I've ever given in my life.   




 I like your spirit!  However, I'm married (and not to cabinet maker, to someone who can't hold a screwdriver) so my cabinet acquiring days outside of the Home Depot are over. :(  Such is life.  




 When they legalize polygamy in one of our countries, we'll make it happen.  




 Until you wrote this, I had no idea that melatonin had to do with circadian rhythm function... You might be on to something.... he never comes to bed on time.  Basically, if this were Harvest Moon for SNES, he would be abandoned by now.    




 In our old apartment, if I needed to see something properly, I had to go into the bathroom.  It was the only room in the whole house he never tampered with.  




 Well, your comments are awesome, I upvoted a ton of them, but sorry cool kid from the UK, I'm married.  It's okay, though, I'm sure I'm too old and possibly too short for your anyhow.  




 He hates being in a properly lit room.  I'm forever coming home to find all the lightbulbs have been switched to the colored kinds that don't actually throw light.... It's very frustrating to turn on a lamp and have things not get brighter.  It's also annoying to leave the room to take a leak and come back to find all the lights have been turned off.  All my houseplants are dying because of the black-out curtains.  

I'm not making this up.  This is a real point of contention in my marriage.  




 Well, this did make me laugh out loud, and that's always a plus. ;) 




 Probably a cabinetmaker.  That would indicate to me that a man is precise, patient, intelligent, perfectionistic, artistic, strong, handy, and focused.   




 If money can't buy happiness, you don't know where to shop! ;) 




 That buzz of connection when you talk to someone and they understand you and you understand them.  It's the opposite of loneliness.   









 This is very hard to put into words because it's not logical in any way, shape, or form.  It's an anxiety behavior for me.  I see a text (especially from someone who makes me uncomfortable like my mother in law) and I don't know what to say.  I agonize over it for a moment.  Come up with nothing.  Get illogically angry at the sender for putting me in this situation, set it aside.  Remember at a later time, fret that too much time has passed for a normal response... continue to do nothing..... I actually cut my former boss out of my life completely just because I never knew what to say to her and couldn't force myself to guess what she might've meant. 




 His mother.  You NEVER criticize an SO's family to your SO.  They will take it personally and it accomplishes nothing. 




 "Where is my Mind" by the Pixies reminds me of the Tracey Fragments.  When they released the film, they did a promo where they released all the raw images to be re-mixed by fans.  Someone did [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVjY7xD6W24) awesome reFragment as it was called.  They did a better job than the movie in a lot of ways!  




 My sister had a car she had totaled twice.  I was driving the damn thing around with the steering wheel airbag compartment and the glove box held shut with zip-ties.  My stepdad had cut the airbags out with a carpet knife, so they were just these raggedy tatters you saw peeping out behind the zip-ties.  I didn't really care, I mean, it got me from point A to point B for much longer than I would have thought it could. :) 

Edit: I finally remembered the name of it!  It was a '96 Ford Contour.   




 This kid and I went out for breakfast.  He made no effort to make conversation and his answers to my questions were monosyllabic or brooked no discussion.  The one that took the cake was when I asked him what kind of music he liked and he said "Don't really like music.  There was a Greenday song that was alright."

WELP.  I guess I'll see you around...  




 Well, it was my understanding that Brits had an even larger tendency towards modesty than we did, but I could be wrong.  It's to do with the fact that we don't like to admit that we have to eliminate waste bodily.  See what I did there?    




 Be awkward and malnourished.  I don't have a type per say, unless emaciated is a type.  I like 'em hungry looking.  




 Killer Mike has a song for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lIqNjC1RKU 




 I'd like to point out that in my experience "taking a leak" is something men do.  I like to say it as a female, and I almost always get derisive laughter when I do.

We call it a restroom because we don't have bath tubs at work, so it's not a bathroom! :) 




 WOW.  That sub-comment.  Really though, I don't wear leggings with anything but a dress, HOWEVER, I can give you my guess.  Our hips are shaped in a way that is not super conducive to comfortable pants.  Add to this the trend that jeans need to be tight, the comeback of the highwaist, and the fact that all work pants are miserable, it's likely just a comfort thing.  We can't put things in our tiny pockets anyway, so we're not really missing function by ditching them.  




 I think probably by sending their nudes to their place of employment.... Or maybe by kidnapping your child and disappearing... really anything that not only ends the relationship, but also ruins the rest of your life.  




 I used to use tricks that boys had used on me to feel me up on boys.  Like you reach for something on the other side of them but drag your arm across them getting it, or you hand them something but press your knuckles against their chest when you do so, or you lose balance and grab onto them in the process.  

Invariably, they looked shocked and mortified.     




 100% down hill, no other answer.  Walking UP the hill relieves the pressure on your feet.  Going down you feel like you're going to topple over and lose your shoes!  




 I was a pretty literal child.  I had a constant fear of not being able to accomplish a directive my mother had given me.  So when she told me that I was to keep my hands folded in my lap and be still, I was very concerned about the fact that my hands didn't seem to want to fold.  

I was also TERRIFIED when a babysitter told me if I didn't do something I would be "dead meat."  I thought she was going to kill me and put me in the freezer.  




 It's okay... when I was four I told my mom I wanted to be an artist.  She told me that artists don't get paid anything until they were dead and so I needed to be more realistic.  Flash forward to a year later, I attended my first funeral and decided I wanted to be like the friendly mortician I met there.  This lasted until I was about 14.  I hope you laughed at this, I was trying to cheer you up.  (But I'm also 100% serious.)

Edit: I totally said I wanted to be a mortician in more than one school publication in the local newspaper.  Ha ha, mom.  




 I know that feel, man.  For me it was my mother.  She also told me that if a group of people don't like you, because there are more of them than there are of you, they must be seeing something you are doing wrong and have a valid point.  You and I will forever second guess ourselves, but at least we will almost certainly survive any crisis since we're constantly imagining the worst possible scenario at any given time. ;) 




 My sister and I have the same nightmare... if we see a swing or a tether ball or anything else that hangs from something, you can bet we're going to end up swinging wildly around in the sky while we panic.  It's quite awful...  




 You know, there is an exchange about this very thing in the dystopia movie "Antiviral."  In it, they sell cloned meat made from the DNA of celebrities.  Syd Winter says to Arvid "I still don't understand how this isn't cannibalism."  Arvid replies that the current popular opinion is that what makes us human is more spiritual than physical.  Our soul in other words.  




 It's commonly believed that it means one of two things:

You're afraid of your own mortality.  Teeth are a sign of power and health.  You lose both as you age.

You said something you wish you hadn't. 




 Uncomfortable.  You have to understand that your outward appearance is hardly an accomplishment that says anything about what kind of person you are.  Just like having dimples or a big pregnant belly, being beautiful makes people think you're public property in a way that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  You owe people things, people get defensive more easily, you're not taken as seriously.   




 Yes, my astonishment at the fact that a huge part of my job was reformatting things in Microsoft Word and ghost writing e-mails for people with three more college majors than me was quite great.   




 Almost anything they sell in an infomercial.  If you want to laugh until you cry, go to Amazon and read the reviews for the MyPillow and the NoNo hair remover.  




 [Thank you for being a friend.](http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2015/news/150420/golden-girls-01-800.jpg) 




 It is like this: you put in at least 1% and after 1 year they will match 5% OF YOUR SALARY.  At the 5 year mark it jumps to 10% OF YOUR SALARY.... Can you even believe that people still decline participation?  It blows my mind!  

I've decided that I have to stay here at least until my daughter stops needing daycare (and I can divert 20% into my Roth 401k), no matter how brain dead it's making me.  




 It's a really stupid story involving my younger sister and the Simon and Garfunkel cover of "My Little Town."  A totally inane story that I never get sick of telling anyone who has ever met my sister.   




 I told my friend about the retirement matching in my company (it's mind-bogglingly good), and he got very excited for me.  Then he made a comment about how we must officially be adults since this is what we're congratulating ourselves on. ;) 




 Well, because you can learn a lot from fiction as well.  A lot of people are not able to apply third person narrative to their lives... it's too abstract and objective and lacks feeling.  When you are reading fiction from a first person perspective, you become that person.  Learning isn't just about facts and figures, it's also about having compassion and learning not to judge everything at face value.  I hope this helps you! :)  




 In high school I had hair down to my hipbones that I pretty much never brushed and I tended to wear a minimum of three shirts... yes, like a homeless person.  When I graduated high school, I cut off all my hair into a pixie cut and moved to a place where it was too hot to pretend to be Rivers Cuomo.  I started working at a Gamestop.  I got phone numbers daily.  Boys would hand me things and "accidently" touch my chest.  My assistant manager printed movie labels he trimmed as commentary for our name tags... I got "The Hot Chick."  

Now, I suspected then that I might be cute, but figured it was more like I was a skinny 6/10 with boobs who played video games.  It wasn't until Tiny Chat that I realized I was regarded as actually beautiful.  When strangers on the internet start hiding all cams but yours and taking screenshots, you just have to wonder.  It wasn't until someone who I literally think is a 10 asked me out of jealousy what it was like to have everyone vying for my attention that I was like maybe I'm missing something here.  

I don't treat anyone differently, I'm just now all the more anxious because it's one more thing that isn't how I think it is. 




 IS MONOPOLY MONEY OKAY???? :D :D :D 




 Yessss, I will take three Quarter Pounders with cheese... oh, and can I get a diet Coke with that? ;)  




 I think we can all relate to not having anything to say to certain people, right?  I've never really made fun of someone for their height, but I'm uncommonly short (just under 5'), and I don't think people do it very seriously.  They're just trying to get my attention and not very clever!  What I think is more obnoxious is how if you tell them this is not clever or original, you're the bad guy... hahaha! 

tl;dr: We can't talk about the weather all the time. 




 I'm not going to type out a huge long story, but my worst boyfriend used to use me as an excuse to get out of things he didn't want to do.  He would lie to his family and work about me being super controlling or about cruel things I apparently said so he wouldn't have to see them or work.  It took me a long time to work out what was going on.  If his mother weren't such a direct person I probably never would have... she called me out on things I had "said" and I felt like the floor fell out from under me!

Yeah, he was a bit crazy, I'd say.  




 I've read that it takes 1 year for your stomach muscles to go back to pre-pregnancy shape if they didn't damage during the late pregnancy.  My stomach looks normal until I eat something.... when I get bloated my stomach is round like I'm 4 months pregnant.  This is hilarious (in a sad way) since I'm down to 107 lbs (I'm just under 5'), but I'm sure it'll pass.  I don't think the droop goes anywhere though.  At least we're in good company! :) 




 Good: Be random.  I have a very abstract sense of humor, I like people who can hang. :)

Bad: Pouting.  I can't handle pouting.  Don't pout.   




 You can't win 'em all. ;) 




 Right, I used to tell people I was named after the "CALL ATT girl," but I haven't made that joke in years since no one has CALLED ATT in a very long time ;) 




 http://i.imgur.com/oReaT.jpg This one made me laugh my ass off.  Relevant!  




 I like it! :) 




 Using a card catalogue.  Guys, have you gone back and checked what World Book had to say about the solar system in 1992?  That shit is hilarious!  This is how we used to educate ourselves?!   




 When my mother said "Maybe it's time to switch to a less reliable form of birth control."   




 If you do not eviscerate all of the children under the age of five within the next hour, we will nuke your entire town.  

I have neighbors.  They know I have a baby... how the hell do I get her out?  Terrifying.  




 Tom Arnold. 




 And I remember my social studies teacher telling us about people using a wheelbarrow to transport all the cash they needed to buy a single loaf of bread in Russia!  Inflation!  It's real! :)  




 There's a lot of shame for physical issues/conditions that are gender specific.  People don't want to hear about lochia or episiotomies or yeast infections.  I'm trying to think of something a guy could bring up that would cause a similar immediate reaction of distaste or disgust, and I'm coming up short.  I was familiar with the term "pre-mature ejaculation" before I reached my adult height!   




 Name the Wind.... My best friend told me it's like Harry Potter for grown-ups, but I'm just like son of a bitch, I'm sick of these spiders...  




 I actually think it must just be poor context.  The only context of this word that I've ever heard that stuck with me was when it was used in those mid-90's Duncan Heines commercials... Moist is totally something I like in a cake.  Now congeal?  Or coagulate? PASS ON THAT.   




 Did you know that in 1920 the average cost of a house was a hair under $4,000?

Obviously if we all got $1,000,000 the inflation would kill our economy and while I'm not quite sure what the worldwide aftershock would be, I'm sure it would be horrifying.  




 This is why I volunteer with a hospice!   




 No, but it's for a totally practical reason: That would wreck the pH in our little lady environments.  I mean, lots of things do, but hell, let's not totally throw reason out the window here... If that wasn't a concern, I'd totally be down. 




 Well, this is irrelevant now being that she is too old to be president realistically... but for awhile there I was hoping Arnold would succeed in his bid to have the constitution amended to allow foreigners who have had US Citizenship for x number of years to be eligible for presidency so that Madeline Albright could have run.  It didn't happen, but she's the person I would have wanted leading my country in 2000.    




 Oh my god, you guys.  Upvotes for everyone.  Thanks for making me cry laughing in my office. 

Contribution so this isn't just a useless post: raisins.  I can't imagine eating raisins could ever be sexy in an unironic way.  




 I think it depends on whether you bought one on impulse or if you're a serious quantified lifer.  I know a kid who has been using his Jawbone to create sophisticated Excel charts that cross reference all kinds of crazy things.  It's pretty much his favorite hobby.  He's been doing it for years! 




 Anytime you have to have what my former boss called "the smelly kid conversation."  Nothing is more awkward than setting someone down and telling them their coworkers are concerned because you don't seem to shower, use deodorant, or change your clothes.

I've had to have this chat with three employees and I've sat in as a second for many, many more.  Remember kids, don't ever have this or a conversation about dress code without a witness.  




 My anxiety makes it very scary for me to think about watching movies I haven't seen before with other people, and if they have already seen the movie, it ratchets that anxiety up to 11.  I know this probably sounds really silly, but it's a thing.  Your friend could be coming from the same place.  It's worth considering.

The last time I had to see a movie with friends, I read the novel and another film adaptation of the source material to "prepare," I haven't seen a movie with friends in almost four years! 




 Well, sometimes you can't do anything that's obvious, you know?  He clearly loves you and trusts you to tell you about it.  He might not ever mention it again, and that's fine.  If he wants help, he'll probably ask for it.   When a sexual abuse occurs, the person involved feels powerless and out of control.  One very subtle way you can help your father is to ask to do things with him that he's really good at and that you're only so-so or bad at.  I can't give you a great example, but say he is a master fisherman.... ask him to take you fishing, ask questions, thank him for teaching you if you think it won't embarrass him. 

I don't want to give you advice about how to handle your uncle, because every family dynamic is different and there are a few factors.  I guess the best advice I can give is to remember what you know and use that knowledge to sort of keep an eye out for any other potential victims.  Intervene in a subtle way when appropriate.  

I'd be happy to talk about this further if you want.  Just shoot me a PM. 




 This is just like Batman vs. Superman.  OF COURSE the ants will win, they are ants... Just like Superman is an ALIEN.  Batman and humanity can only hope to get a few shots in with our expensive toys and our wits, but we all know it's just a matter of time...  




 Well, judging by the films made in the 70's that were set in the future, I think it would be hard to believe that smoking became LESS prevalent, not more!    




 I don't know what you all are talking about... my mom makes mom jokes all the time... they're like this: "Well, you can do what you want to do... BUT YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ;)"  or  "I know you think I'm stupid, so you'll just do what you want..."  It's a joke because no matter what you do, you're screwed.  All you can do is laugh... until you cry.  




 I actually never had any.  I was tempted to lie since people took this as license to have a very long and stupid conversation about their disbelief that this was the actual case.  When you're that pregnant, you don't want to have the same unoriginal conversation every two hours.  I also got tired of people coming to my office and saying "You're still here!"  YES, OBVIOUSLY.  




 I got a breadmaker for Christmas one year.  I was trying to make bread a week later and I couldn't find my half-cup measure anywhere.

I asked my husband about it.  He said he "maybe, might have thrown it away, but can't remember exactly..."  I was understandably annoyed and told him it would be very difficult to make bread without it since you have to be so precise for things to turn out well.

An hour later he came into the house from outside with the measuring cup and said to me "Look!  It's a New Year's Miracle!"  




 I blitzed through the "His Dark Materials" trilogy in a weekend.  If you're asking for the purpose of school, I recommend it purely on the basis that there are a lot of topics in it that make for great essays.   




 Something that I really like is when a guy is handy.  If you can do car repairs or build things it indicates to me that you have a natural curiosity about the world and that you're pragmatic.  Handy guys who spend a lot of time out in their garages also don't tend to be co-dependent.  They know the value of personal accomplishment.  That is a beautiful thing! :) 




 No screen time before (and definitely not in) bed.  Go to bed a bit earlier than you need to fall asleep (I like an hour), and read.  I like to read things I'm interested in, but are unarguably a bit boring like novels by Thomas Hardy or Jane Austen.  They are great to sleep to.  You don't want to have coffee or other caffeinated drinks within 8 hours of your bedtime.  Don't exercise before bed.  It can be helpful to start a night-time ritual, like taking a shower, putting on your pajamas, turning off all the lights in your house in a certain order, reading for a half hour.  Studies show that our bodies respond to memory of ritual and you will begin to get tired during step one after your body begins to correlate that you only shower before you sleep...it also lowers your body temp, which makes you tired.  Invest in a white noise machine (not a sound machine).  Be active while you're awake.    




 This actually reads very nicely to me.  My only comment is that if this person is going to be a supervisor you may want to focus more on things that make a good supervisor (constantly developing personally, sensitive to the needs of others, hardworking, innovative, diplomatic) and a tiny bit less on their great deal of heart (for lack of a better term). You don't want him to seem too emotional for the job, and let's face it, a lot of people can't do supervisor work for just that reason.  You get pretty beat up!  




 After I had my baby, I tried to go back and play the Sims 3 one day... I managed to snatch an uninterrupted hour (a miracle) and accomplish decorating half a Sim house (read: absolutely nothing accomplished).  It put into perspective that I had probably dumped hundreds upon hundreds of hours into video games.

It's good that you would like to go out and do things, and therein lies your opportunity to meet like-minded folks.  Now you're probably going to find that at a wine-tasting there's going to be a lot of 40-something soccer moms that zone out when you try to speak to them, just don't give up.  Eventually you will find someone in your various activities that will jump at the chance to do other fun things with you.  

You're right about body image, it starts on the inside.  If you're serious about bulking up, there is a lot of science and theory to be had, which will appeal to your intellectual side.  I recommend you look into intermittent fasting in muscle building.  It will challenge everything you have been brought up to believe about eating. 

If you really have anxiety, you will probably always struggle with it to some degree.  I'm high-functioning, but still very high anxiety.  I will notice little innocuous things I'm doing, like putting off a phone call and then have to talk myself up in my head to stop that behavior.  The key to avoiding missed opportunities due to anxiety is to just question your negativity.  Try to see things from another angle.  If you think "Wow, this person is really rude... they must not like me. :(" Take a step back and think about the last time you said something with the specific intention of hurting another person.  You probably can't come up with one, because that's not really how we function as human beings.  That other person is the same as you and probably meant no harm.  

I hope this helps you! :) 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q72cK8MyEUk 3:00 to see Johnny Rzeznik of the Goo Goo Dolls talking about wearing a dress around his apartment in the 80's.   




 Drizzt Do'Urden 




 White ratty gym socks with pants that are just a hair too short.  




 Hard to argue with happiness, I suppose, but man... how awful. ;) 




 I have a cousin whose middle name is "T," as in just a letter, nothing longer.  Apparently "T" is the first initial of his mother, his father, both uncles, and I think a few other people besides.  She couldn't think of who to honor, so she left it open to interpretation.  




 Aw snap, here we go.  The first time my mother met this old dude next door, he was walking around with bread bags tied over his shoes... he was phobic of dog feces. 

He told her that he used to work, but didn't because he had a total meltdown and ended up in a mental institution for five years. 

He used to randomly fire his hunting rifle into the woods behind our houses from his deck.  Not aiming, just firing.  

He didn't play the radio, because it transmits the sound from your house to the government.  

One time my mom was watching birds in the backyard with her binoculars.  There was Milt... watching her with binoculars from his yard.

We were under strict orders to never talk to him alone.   




 Peppermint Schnapps.  Listen guys, don't ever play a drinking game like "Never Have I Ever" with Peppermint Schnapps.  It's been 7 years and thinking about it still makes me gag.  




 Eating more than five olives in one sitting will give you an amazingly painful stomach ache.  Apparently my mother was very passionate about keeping the olives in the house.   




 Black Hills Energy was the only utility company that I ever encountered that treated their customers as their number 1 priority, and I have encountered a lot of utility companies in my former profession.  Would recommend/10.  




 After I put in my two weeks at Gamestop, I just like, gave no fucks.  The best time was when this kid came in.  I greeted him, as was required.  He ignored my greeting.  Pretended to look around, then made his way back to me to turn in a job application.  I said "Let me get this straight.... you want me to give you a job, but you didn't even return my greeting?  You do know that greeting people is, like 30% of this job right?"  He was actually a sport and said "Oh man! I didn't know I was at a pre-interview, how can I convince you?  Do I still have a shot?" I said it depended and what did he know about video games?  He proceeded to reveal that the only game he had ever played ever was Megaman on SNES.  You better believe I slapped a do-not-bother post-it on that application.  No regrets, I'm 100% sure he didn't want to do what I was doing for the pitiful wage of $5.15/hr.  He dodged a bullet and didn't even know it.  




 Get yourself one of these puppies: http://www.amazon.com/Munchkin-Baby-Food-Grinder-Light/dp/B000GB0NZA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1432999738 sr=8-1 keywords=food+grinder+baby

Mix it with other things once it's the texture of mashed potatoes if you don't just want to cook it with garlic and olive oil and eat it like that. :) 

Brocoli is pretty much a super food, so I get it!  I'd also try it a few other ways... like is it raw that bothers you?  Just cooked?  Heads? Stems?  Identify what bothers you, and try to work around it.  Good luck, friend!  




 Have you tired /r/kindvoice or /r/needafriend ?  Both tend to have offers all the time with a/s listed.

I'm too old for you, or I'd offer. :) 




 Not to sound like I'm wearing a tin-foil hat here, but a number of things I've noticed went hay-wire on the internet on Memorial Day.  I think the government knows why and possibly were involved while we all celebrated what Facebook tells me isn't national barbecue day.   




 List action:

What's that got to do with the price of salt?
Variation: What's that got to do with the price of tea in China?

You get more bees with honey than you do with vinegar.

I pinned her ears back.

I'm snug as a bug in a rug.

Your eyes are bigger than your belly.

I've got to go so bad my eyeballs are floating.

You make a better door than a window.

Tough tittie said the kittie, but the milk's still good. (Variant: the milk's still free.)

All the grace of a newborn elephant.

I'll be there with bells on.

You're fine? Fine as frog's fur? 




 Absolutely, man.  There could be something bigger at play here... like a company reorganization or the company being purchased by a parent company.   




 Thank you for using "tall poppy syndrome" which prompted me to google what that means, which informed me there is a word for a thing that I see all the time!  I'm going to be speaking much more efficiently now! :) 




 mfw it is already happening.  We're expelling carbon dioxide.  If we don't, we die.  Did I just break your time-space continuum?  Tell me, bby.  




 Right, I'm not going to name names here, but a very large utility was paying their direct hires $35.00/hr to take phone calls, while they paid only $16.99 per dedicated hour for our agents to take the same calls.  (We paid these agents about $8.50/hr)  As one of the other contributors pointed out, pay differential aside, they didn't need to cover any benefits for us.  They also weren't spending money on coaching.  All of that was on our dime, so they had the freedom to mandate we meet certain goals, save themselves money while we worked with the agents, and ultimately leave if we didn't deliver.   There is a reason why these numbers are normally private and thus why you would be confused.   




 I think it's quite beautiful to recognize that you're young at heart and to be young for as long as you can be.  I mean, we're only getting older, you'll never get the chance again.  

I think you just need to do some things that make you feel smart and competent.  For me, that is traveling.  I never feel as smart and free and independent as I do when I'm in an airport.  When you travel alone, you can indulge in your childlike wonder at the world around you.  You can be you without thinking yourself to death the way you do when you're just home alone.  

It's good to think the best of people and to be curious about them.  That alone will get you far as many people love to talk about themselves.  If you ask questions, typically you don't need to worry about expressing yourself too well, because the other person will go on a bit.  While I can be a chatty Kathy (obviously) I'm intrinsically curious about why people do what they do and how and what they feel about it.  So while I am largely awkward, having met my best friend at 23, a lot of people consider me to be their friend merely on merit that I've asked them things and listened to their answers and remembered little things about them. 

The wonderful thing about being a human being is that if we don't like our circumstances, there is rarely a situation where we can't change them completely.  I totally encourage you to think about the things you like to imagine you are brave enough to do and to just do them.  No one ever lies in their deathbed and says "I wish I had spent more time worrying and waiting to start my life," right?  Be brave and be you and do everything you want to do.  You deserve it.  You only live in this wonderful world once. :) 




 I'll chime in again, hey, why not.  Another thing my husband gets a lot is the description that he looks like Mr. Clean.  

What?  My husband is 160 lbs soaking wet at 6'2"... he's not a ripped old man in a small t-shirt.  He also doesn't have bushy white eyebrows or blue eyes or a killer tan.  He doesn't have a pierced ear and he doesn't wear jeans.... Are you saying he's bald?  Yes.  He happens to be bald.  




 I'm sorry that you're having such a rough time.  I can't speak about your culture and I won't presume to, but you asked if it was true whether no matter where a man is from, he'd be bothered.  The answer to that is no.  I'm an American.  I did not come into my marriage as a virgin.  My husband could not care less.  

I hope things get better for you.  Please feel free to PM me if you're ever lonely and need a sympathetic ear.  You are more than your currency as a potential mate.
