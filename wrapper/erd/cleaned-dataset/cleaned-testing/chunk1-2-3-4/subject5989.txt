 link? 




 Thanks for sharing, looks awesome :). Mine is your typical 4x4 :( lol 




 Hey guys, I love Rust. Primarily base building. However I'm not too great at making something that looks awesome. Anyone care to share what theirs looks like? Or know of any sites that show how to guides etc for sweet base layouts? Thanks :P 




 fuck that, did it on normal already 




 Would love to see decklists :) 




 Thanks for the info! Bought it today and played a little Altis Life xD. Although I had no idea what to do lol 




 When you go to multiplayer do you simply type in Altis life or you need a specific server address to type in which then downloads the appropriate files? I've been waiting to get this for like 6 months I'm praying its on sale today! lol 




 Waiting on the 50% off too, was so sad when it lost the community vote lol :(. Need to play that Altis life 3. I heard it's built right into the game now so you don't need to download anything additional is that true? 




 It worked, thanks! 




 Any ideas people? I can't even use the "ESC" key.

 How is it restricting you? Pick any state and then google Zip codes for the state of whichever you have chosen. 




 no proxy, im in Canada. I made an amazon.com account. used my canadian credit card and just put in a random US address. 




 I can confirm as long as you make the account on amazon.com and put in a bogus US address it works. 




 To each their own, he asked for a script not your view on botting. 




 Well feel free to share lol, I only started playing Sunday night myself also. So we're both newbies. 




 So this works within the steam version of the game? Are you able to do other things while this is running or are you stuck in that active window like you're typical auto clicker? Thanks. 




 Does this also do ascensions to farm souls? Would love if you posted this script. I've been using a simple auto clicker, can't find any script that works with the steam version of this game unfortunately. (Just started playing a couple days ago). 




 OMG. Thanks for making me hungry and sad all at the same time. Nothing like this around me sadly :( 




 That's awesome, good work. I'd love to be a co-admin if I could find people looking for one, or at least have unlimited resources.. Would like to be able to build and improve on my design skills. 




 wow nice, this was before the stability stuff existed? Don't see how the tree stuff is possible. Also were you an Admin? tons of mats for those id assume. 
























 Although I like all of them I think I'm still leaning towards DGM. White and Blue are awesome but they're so overdone, literally everyone has one of those two colors. 




 Nice! I'm in Ontario too :D 




 I'm about to purchase a 16' STi Sport and can't decide on the color. I have it down to WRB, White, or DGM. I'm leaning towards DGM but not 100% sure yet. What do you all think? 




 Was also wondering, how much were the protective measures you took at the detail-er if you don't mind me asking?   




 Is this the DGM? Been debating what color to get for my STi. This really makes me lean towards your color lol 




 My Impreza is white, does the fact that the interior is red/black bother you? lol. I'm down to either white, blue or DGM. 




 My current Impreza is Satin White and I love it, although it gets dirty so easily  




 I normally don't like blue but the STi is an exception, really speaks to the Subaru heritage. Although the black/red interior makes me OCD run wild as it doesn't go with blue at all IMO lol 




 glad you got it working :) 




 congrats! I'm picking up one myself soon. Still can't decide between wrb or white. 
























 Yeah I love the STi just I really want a fully loaded vehicle. Would be really tight getting the fully loaded STi  




 That's what I've been thinking, can get it fully loaded whereas I can't afford a fully loaded STi. Although I will miss the STi badging (which I can live without I assume). Will really miss that big wing on the back (wondering where I could find one for the WRX and how much it would cost me) lol 




 Gorgeous, should be illegal to get an STi without that big wing though :P 




 Shout out to Sauga boys! 




 Oh there is a car in the picture? ;). Yeah the ride is pretty sweet too! 




 Congrats, still debating between WRX or STi 




 Absolutely gorgeous, congrats! 




 Thanks for sharing, I'm in a similar situation. Big into gaming but have been wanting to get back into shape. I was 165 my whole life pretty much (I'm 6'0). Now I'm up to 212 and hate looking in the mirror. I got a fitbit and have discovered MFP which I've been using for the last 3 days or so. I've just been eating right and going for daily walks. I would like to get back into going to the gym to get a body like yourself but I have no idea where to start. What foods to eat, what exercises to do at the gym, do I write them down etc etc. Any help would be greatly appreciated! 




 I hate the lapis blue lol, if I were to ever get blue it would be the WRB or that new blue they unvieled. :P 




 I never thought of it like that, thanks for sharing your POV and enjoy the new ride!
