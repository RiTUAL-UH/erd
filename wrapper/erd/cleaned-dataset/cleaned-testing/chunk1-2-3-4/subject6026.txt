 Looks more like a bear nose to me.. http://m.imgur.com/cLoTM2M 




 Where are these images from?
 




 I can relate. I have both versions of the game and doing the custom night challenges on pc are so much easier because of this. On the mobile port golden Freddy just kills you no matter what and I've sorta stopped attempting the rest of the custom night challenges because of this. Hopefully scott fixes this after fnaf 3 comes out. 




 Aww what a cute psychotic killer animatronic...



He actually is really cute in the drawing tho. 




 But why would scott eat something that usually taste really bad? Like really,really bad. 




 Scoot Cuthon
 
























 I was looking around the archive for scottgames.com and noticed that theres been alot of recent saves of the hat.jpg picture which usually means its been changed. It could just be something else of course and im not going to take my time to brighten each and everyone one of them.  




 Also the bad ending has golden freddys head in the background,while the good ending doesn't. 




 Ill delete this post, then. 




 Oh, sorry. I didn't see. 




 We all know that Golden Freddy Appears in the fnaf3 stage01 minigame since you play as him. The file dump for fnaf3 was recently released with the sound files and textures. While looking through the textures i found this guy (its #290 if you want to look for yourself) So, where do you guys think he is. Its transparent so he probably belongs somewhere unless scott removed him. Anyone seen him yet? 




 Yeah but there's sort of a dead body inside of it. You'd think the person buying it would've noticed. 
























 spooky. 




 exactly  




 they're ghost. 




  I believe the toys didn't free them, just brought them together. When purple guy is killed they finally get their revenge and are freed. I also think the original child (The Puppet) was killed in fredbear's which is probably why they were so quick to sell to Fazbear Entertainment. That's just what I think though. We'll probably never know all the answers to the story, we just have to work with what we have. 




 they're ghost... 




 well thats why i put 'might be'. Also i doubt Scott is making FNAF4. The series had its good run and started a good community. Actually, maybe not a good community..whatever. 
























 where the fuck are the shop/security  party hats located

 Yeah,you should've posted this to the [Five nights at Fuckboys subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/fnafb) though 




 I was wondering if I needed my serial code on the back of my 3ds to still trade it in. After a long time it came off of course. I remember trying to trade in my old DS lite before and gamestop didn't let me because the serial code was gone. I was also wondering how much money is knocked off if you don't turn it in with the charger.
