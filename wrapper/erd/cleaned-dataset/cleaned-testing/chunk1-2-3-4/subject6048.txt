 Sounds like you need to let go. If she wasn't interested in you in that way, her opinion isn't going to change by you just convincing her. D-Bag move by your buddy though, I think you could use a new friend AND a new love interest. 




 Who/what is 'itmejp'? 




 That /r/giants pre-game shot was the essence of rivalry. 




 Pretend you're with people you ARE comfortable with, whether that's close friends or certain family members. They're probably a bit nervous about hanging with you- be the one that reaches out. Think of it as an opportunity to make a valuable, unique connection. 




 Does it bother anyone else that there's zero split-screen capability for both campaign AND multiplayer? 




 Any suggestions to a specific product would be most appreciated.

Thanks! 




 I did the train show on Friday night had a fantastic time. 




 So much for having a productive day at the office... 




 Read samples of each book on Amazon (Google Books most likely has them too). Everyone has a different taste for style of writing, and when it comes to research everyone absorbs material differently. Spend 5-10 minutes on each book and see what sticks. 




 Better experience with e-ink. 




 Dune. Can't believe it took me this long to read that brilliance. 




 It may be my favorite book as well. There's never been something so long that I've become so completely engrossed in. A lot of it has to do with being an American and already being intrigued by Japanese culture- that was the case for me and I'm sure a lot of Clavell lovers.

Just like the protagonist, the reader finds him/herself washed ashore in a strange land with an entirely new lifestyle and mindset that permeate throughout all the inhabitants. And as you read on, these feudal Japanese concepts make more sense, become less foreign, and just like the hero you find yourself falling in love with this way of life.

This is a tremendous adventure book, a tremendous history book, and a tremendous spiritual book. So happy for you to have had the pleasure of reading it.  




 I used to have the same issue as you, SO frustrating!

I read on a kindle so they track your progress a percentage. In order to read a book in a week's time, I need at least 17% a day. I set a goal every day to reach that amount, and it commits me to the book. Obviously I don't always stick to this but over the past couple years it's worked out well.

If you prefer raw doggin it with real books just make it 30 pages or a chapter, whatever your comfortable with. Best of luck- 




 From RA Salvatore I'd move to some Raymond E Feist, start with the Riftwar Saga. Robert Jordan's wheel of time is excellent, but very long. A Song of Ice and Fire is the best as far as I'm concerned, but is lacking in a lot of the traditional fantasy elements. For something weird and challenging The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe. David Eddings has written a lot of great fantasy, for him start with Pawn of Prophecy. And of course, Lord of The Rings. 




 This is probably the best advice I've ever give anyone: Don't see the ball drop. Spend hours in the freezing cold, you can't leave to go to the bathroom, can't leave to get food or drinks, and no room whatsoever. 




 I want to be in that moment right now.
 




 Might try the Belgariad series by David Eddings. I've read a good bit and fantasy and typically do find romance to be a lacking element. I read a couple books into this series a long time ago and remember there to be some high quality romance written. Might be best to read some more opinions on it as my memory is fairly cloudy about this.

A Song of Ice and Fire also has some great romance now that I think on it. 




 Look up "sell books" on Yelp in your area 




 Haha enjoy! 




 Judge for yourself, but I think without question. Many of the main and most popular characters are female. Here's a pretty humorous quote that gets thrown around a lot- http://imgur.com/nu2Mipb

The books are fantastic. I'd be surprised if you read 30ish pages into the first one without being hooked. 




 How'd the cops get tipped off? 




 Packers- Let's be honest they're probably screwed anyway without A-Rod steering the ship. They're gonna have to run it all game, ATL has a soft run defense, ATL's passing attack will be diminished by the weather.

I'd say it benefits the Pack the most because a) They're desperate for a win and b) I don't think they can win this game without this edge. 




 There's a ton of businesses in this country that give out loans to people like you. Interest rates are more lucrative for them but A LOT of businesses get started this way. If you're in a major city there's certainly some available.

Here is one that I'm familiar with - http://www.nextlevelfunding.com/

Being able to overcome failure is what truly defines a person's character. Sounds like you're quite motivated and I'm sure you have a bright future. Best of luck. 




 What do those characters translate to?

Great drawing! 




 I mean this in a nice way, because you seem like a hard worker and a good person, but you're being a 'pussy' in this relationship. You deserve better. She sounds like a bad person. You're young, spend some time apart and meet someone that appreciates you. Are you happy? Because there are women out there that will make you actually happy- toxic relationships don't allow for that. 




 How much debt do you have exactly? Have you considered community college- why do you think you were unsuccessful at school?

Your first step, without question has to be losing weight. It's something that's entirely in your control and will only open up more options for you down the road, aside from making you feel substantially better about yourself. r/loseit and r/fitness are invaluable resources for this. 




 Thoroughly enjoyed reading this- you've got a talent for writing sci-fi hope you stick with it! 




 Sorry for the bad advice! Thanks for informing me, though. Looks like I was completely in the dark on my egg info and need to do more reading up on it.

I still stand by my beans, great inexpensive high protein option. 




 Have you tried A Song of Ice and Fire? 




 Might want to cut down on those yolks for starters, that's what going to mainly affect your cholesterol and egg whites will give you plenty of protein.

Beans, lentils, tuna fish, peanut butter, and nuts- all great sources. If you can find some organic low sodium canned beans, they are an excellent healthy and inexpensive option- and pack a great deal of protein. 




 You haven't really talked about why it is you want to get married so bad. Could you shed some light on this? 




 Been reading up on Little, Big and have to say I am thoroughly intrigued- I can't believe it received so many awards and I'm not familar with it. Have you read anything else by Wolfe? I was looking into his other pieces and thinking of picking up The Death of Doctor Island. 




 Dude's practically begging to get his dick grabbed. 




 Ice skating in Bryant park, walking around Central Park, botanical gardens in the Bronx, there's a lot of great bars with fireplaces that are nice to hang out at, Bryant Park and Union Square will be filled to the brim with small shops that are great to find gifts at. 




 Shogun and pretty much anything else by James Clavell. 




 Once those interior D-Linemen started getting injured that run defense was screwed. I remember the Giants went into that week 6 game with arguably the worst rushing offense in the league, Bears made Brandon Jacobs look like AP. 




 This guy also did a Ted talk I enjoyed, basically the same subject- 

Aubrey de Grey: A roadmap to end aging via @TEDiSUB
http://www.ted.com/talks/aubrey_de_grey_says_we_can_avoid_aging.html 




 You could use that app in conjunction with r/writingprompts.

It'd be great to have an app that rewarded you with points and had an rpg/experience system. 




 The Master and the Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov is a weird russian novel. If you're looking for fantasy, The Book of the New Sun series is a tomb but it's a weird challenging-but-rewarding read.

When I was having a tough time I became completely engulfed in Shogun by James Clavell. Very easy to disappear into that book if you need to, I'd recommend this one the most. 




 Whole Foods has truly conquered this dillema. 




 I'd say it'll most certainly get better in your calves as long as you continue running. If October was your first half it makes sense for them to not be used to such an undertaking. Hard to give a timetable, but as long as you keep at it they'll become stronger and more durable. 




 Awesome. 




 I started trying a few weeks ago and have also been encountering difficulties. What method have you been using primarily? 




 Yeah but their post-game rates range from $5,000 to $7,500. 




 Saints- after a loss like that against the Seahawks, Sean 'Vendetta' Payton is gonna show the world what kind of hell his offense can truly raise. Would love to see panthers win this though, that team's been a tremendous story this year. 




 If he decides to stay after next year, why in the world would he want out of Denver? He's been put into a dream situation- things would not be going as smoothly if he had signed with Arizona or Miami. I also don't see another owner in the nfl that can relate to his quarterback as well as Elway does. 




 Turns out he wasn't real. 




 You won't have to read that far, and fortunately for you the movie changed many fundamental aspects of the book so not too much will be ruined. It's a tremendous trilogy, definitely worth reading (Book 2 is my favorite).

Try to just get lost in the book, the world Pullman creates is very intriguing. I've read the first one twice and both times feel as though I'm on my own adventure exploring this strange alternate world that Lyra and her companions occupy.
 




 Off the top of my head:

Science Fiction: Hyperion by Dan Simmons and Dune by Frank Herbert (Both are the first books in a series).

Historical Fiction: Shogun by James Clavell, First Man in Rome by Colleen McCullough, and pretty much anything by Michael Crichton.

Fantasy: Wheel of Time Series and Book of the New Sun

"Classic" Authors: Mark Twain, Dostoyevsky, Dickens, and Kafka (These are the ones I'm personally most familiar with, obviously there's many more of excellent quality out there).

EDIT: I realized these are just books that I personally liked. There's tons of lists out there by people more well-read, just google it up. This list from Esquire pointed me in a great direction a while ago: http://www.esquire.com/the-side/feature/80-books#slide-1 




 Anyone else peer down at their legs in shame after watching this? 




 I always felt that students were turned off to literature courses due to the intimidating length of so many of these books. Someone who's never read 400+ page book recreationally is going to avoid one of these courses at all costs- and rightly so! That kind of inexperience would make reading one of those take up way too much time. This doesn't lessen the content in any way, if anything you dig more out of the text by having a smaller area of study. 




 This was a huge help for me as far as personal finance:

http://www.amazon.com/Get-Financial-Life-Personal-Twenties-ebook/dp/B001UP63MS/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8 qid=1386187208 sr=8-3 keywords=personal+finance 




 Are they looking for something different, exciting? Then absolutely.

The main issue with SNM is a lot of the situations are going to make you uncomfortable, and your experience is going to be entirely a product of what kind of attitude you have.

Yes it's going to get weird, that's what make's it such a unique experience. If it's not embraced though, I can see them having a bad time. 




 Thanks!

I've been considering Jailbreaking my iPad for a while and this re-lit the fire a bit. I'll have to do some research on how this would be handled. 




 Magnifies how awful the film was for not portraying any of this to a casual audience. 




 This seems to have been an impactful injury this season. I haven't really been following this team, has this played a serious role in their offense struggles this year? How has his replacement performed? 




 Depends, what part of the city you gonna be in?

If you're gonna be near midtown I'd recommend The Football Factory (33rd St between Broadway and 5th). 




 If you think this person would enjoy Historical Fiction, two books I can't recommend enough are:

The First Man in Rome by Colleen Mccullough

and

Shogun by James Clavell 




 I'm new to using Mods such as this- Is this something that can be used on a Jail-broken Tablet or is this PC-exclusive? 




 Some of the best Sci-Fi ever written. 




 American Psycho. A tremendous satire on the Wall Street/Yuppie culture that permeated the elite class of new york city in the 1980s....and some of the most disturbing passages you will ever read. If you've got a weak stomache, the last 1/3 of this book should be avoided. 




 Something that helped me tremendously was Sperm Wars by Robin Baker. Keep in mind this is written by a biologist, but it teaches you how men/women are innately wired and why we act the way we do. In my opinion profoundly more helpful than a lot of these typical dating/pick up artist guides.

http://www.amazon.com/Sperm-Wars-Infidelity-Conflict-Bedroom-ebook/dp/B0046A8SEU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1386179569 sr=8-1 keywords=sperm+wars
 




 For something more on the traditional side, I'd recommend anything by Raymond E. Feist. Best to start with the Riftwar Saga and the book Magician.

For something more challenging/pretty weird, I'd recommend The Book of the New Sun series by Gene Wolfe. 




 I'm not sure if there's a website/database that has the information- couldnt find it on my own. Anyone have thoughts? Main concern is this Brown/Patriots game coming up. Have a feeling Amendola is going to catch a big nut on Sunday.

Thoughts? 
























 I just finished "Stranger in a Strange Land". A popular science fiction novel from the sixties, this delves into a deep examination of what we value in a western culture, particularly in regards to religion and sexuality.

More importantly, this book is funny. There's humor enriched in all the pages, and makes reading it a genuinely enjoyable experience. 

After reading intense and complicated sci-fi, I chose this as a light option. I ended doing a serious examination about what my values are how people view things in western (especially American) society.

I'd suggest looking up some of the tremendous quotes from this book on a site like Goodreads, see if you find any intriguing, you may want to pick it up. 









 It took several moments for her words to register in his brain. The waves of adrenaline and euphoria hadn't finished passing over him. The knife...had he plunged it into a handbag my mistake? Certainly he felt the comforting sensation of cool metal sliding into that bloated sack of blood dangling off of her skeleton. Malcolm made efforts to maintain his natural steadfast, intimidating state, yet his face could not untwist itself from puzzlement.

"Take out the blade", she said softly. A whisper, drowned out by the wind as if not a  note had escaped her lips yet words he heard clear as crystal in his head. Her grey eyes piercing so deep into his own, it felt as if she was gazing at the entirety of his life.

Malcolm strained and sweated as he found himself gripping the chaffed, ribbed bronze hilt. Hot. More than hot, scalding. His eyes bulged with terror as he found himself tightly grasping and removing the scalding metal. Tendrils of smoke appeared above his hand. Nothing to hear but his heartbeat. Loud and hot. Nothing to see but her eyes. Grey and sharp. Drips of melted skin began to smack the pavement below.

The knife left her belly, a gaping wound left smoking, staring up at him.

"Now balance the scale", she commanded.

There was an instant, an instant after those words were uttered that he knew he was about to perish. An instant of complete terror, and a juvenile absence of any form of understanding. When that moment had passed the blade leapt from his fingertips and dug itself deep into his throat. Indeed, choosing this woman in particular to mug was a poor evaluation.

The woman stared down at the corpse, and drank in a deep gulp of icy, bloodfilled air, "I can't help but enjoy these moments", she mused. A faint grin crept along the side of her mouth. She decided to continue her stroll throughout the park. 




 Wouldn't offering to work for free be the most efficient way to get practice early on? Especially if OP is doing this as a hobby rather than trying to get by, he/she can probably afford a few free contracts. Doing VO's for student films doesn't seems like nearly as valuable a learning experience as actual professional work, and if it's as competitive as you say it is, quality and experienced professionals should have little trouble getting jobs over people like him.  




 Twixt was honestly the worst movie I've ever seen.  




 The scene I'm referring to is where Mcnulty is sitting in his car drunk. He's on top of a hill, some kind of commotion happens at the bottom of it and causes a car alarm to go off. He gets out, shows his badge, and slips and slides down the hill because he's so hammered. Then proceeds to start laughing when he sees mud on his badge and the obvious metaphor.

Anyway, there's a oldie playing in his car, sung by a woman- can't for the life of me think of the song. Can't remember the episode or season or I'd try to find it myself. Hope I gave a decent description and one of you can help me out. Thanks all.
 




 This is something minor, that occurs anywhere from several times a week to several times a month. I'm 25 and take care of my body. I eat healthy and exercise ~5 times a week. Would an EKG be sufficient? My concern is that I'll have an EKG, everything will come up normal, but there is an underlying problem it doesnt pick up.

Possibly I'm overthinking this and am paranoid?

Thanks. 




 ...or any other crowd-funding method for that matter.

I always end up reading about these games when they initially show up, and are naturally surrounded by a lot of hype. "This is going to be a tremendous RPG just like it was in the glory days!".

Have any of you played these games? Been involved with development? Read about anything interesting as in do they live up to what they promise?

I started reading up on this one, which got be thinking on the subject: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/482445197/unsung-story-tale-of-the-guardians

Love to know what you all think. 




 Learning about camera angles, lighting, literally any kind of discussion in regards to film making. 




 Thanks for taking the time to give such a thoughtful response! 

Going to some small classes is a great idea. I've almost exclusively done yoga by myself, and having an instructor critique me on my form would be quite valuable. I like the idea of exploring different poses and flows. I think I'm going to start with some sun salutations, and explore different variations of warrior, maybe triangle. 

Cheers. 




 Having Griffin run out in wide receiver routes is one of the most irresponsible moves he could have made. 




 I've been doing Yoga on and off for several years now. Learned mainly from this book: http://www.amazon.com/Moving-Toward-Balance-Weeks-Rodney/dp/0875969216/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top

I want to do a quick routine every morning that takes roughly 10-15 minutes. Was hoping someone could point me in the right direction, or possibly just give me a routine that they enjoy doing themselves.

Happy Friday! 




 Hopefully it lacks all form of similarity to the last sequel they made. 




 Inspiring images. When the day to day office grind is draining at my psyche, it's posts like this that remind me that we live in such a beautiful and adventurous world. Thanks for sharing these, brotha. 




 No one wants to say it, but Jaime isn't gonna make it. He's my favorite....but we all know what's coming. 




 Wow this is exactly what I needed. Thanks so much and happy new year! 




 I'm at work, only access to reddit is through my phone AND the content is NSFW, otherwise I'd give this a shot myself.

Here's the link(NSFW): http://m.pornhub.com/video/show/title/giselle_cole_interracial/vkey/617461911

Thanks!

Thanks!

EDIT: Words 




 Why don't you just dump her? 




 I say this with the New York Giants in mind, but obviously this question could be in the context of many teams this year. 

It's quite a popular opinion that Kevin Gilbride, their Offensive coordinator, needed to leave a long time ago. Considering he was together with big TC back in Jacksonville, my thinking is that Coughlin will stay loyal to his man. What do you guys think will happen? 




 How was the sex? 




 I wouldn't exactly describe Friday's tropical storm/both headliners cancelling as an amazing experience.

That being said I'll be there next year. 




 How long you been drawing for? This is so impressive!

Any website you'd recommend for a total noob trying to learn? 




 There's going to be four of us total at my friends house and was looking for any suggestions your guys may have. Here are some ideas we're tossing around right now:

1) dressing up in old Halloween costumes

2) laying out paper/crayons/markers and partake in some arts n crafts

3) playing music throughout surround sound (not sure what to choose, possibly a medley of nature sounds, classical, funk, jazz)

Love to know what you all think! Thanks! 




 Think about how difficult it is to scout a player. You have to look at someone when they're 17 and determine who they will be when they're 26. Try doing that in any profession or school of thought. All of these guys have great athletic talent- imagine the enormous process of evaluating all the other factors that will affect these people not just as football players but as men. If anything they're going to be wrong MOST of the time. Every pick is a gamble. Something you just have to accept. 




 2011 week 14 against the Giants. At this point, both teams were in the hunt for the division. Basically the Giants were down 12 points with time expiring. They score their first touchdown. In order to have a shot at scoring their second, they need the Cowboys to go 3 and out on the next drive in order to leave enough time on the clock. On 3rd and long, Romo had a completely wide open Miles Austin who is just running with his hands up to Romo's right, around 15 yards down the field. Romo then lobs it about another 15 yards ahead of him into dead space. Giants go on to win the game. 

Personally I think Romo is a great QB that gets way too much shit- simply a product of being on the Cowboys. He dug himself into a hole early in his career by embracing his celebrity status, but I think at this point he's moved past it. This is a guy that made a 4th quarter comeback with a punctured lung and several broken ribs- someone like that will always have my respect.

EDIT: Wording

 The winners in this were the attorneys on both sides collecting fees for 8 months. 




 "This just in: the Washington Redskins have traded their 2015 and 2016 first round picks to the Green Bay Packers in a trade for Matt Flynn." 




 Stop being a pussy and get a divorce. 




 Bill Bryson has put out a lot of great work- I'd recommend browsing his other books online and seeing if anything catches your interest. This is assuming it's the style/voice he uses that made you like it so much.

As far as more on the topics of that book? Definitely A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking and Cosmos by Carl Sagan.

'A Short History of Nearly Everything' is a fantastic read, glad you enjoyed it. I read it a while back, and about a week ago bought the Audible version of it. Every time I hit the gym now I have this great british voice babbling to me about atoms and stardust. Highly recommend this for anyone looking for a great audio book, you can pick it up at any point in the narrative and immediately find things interesting. 




 He's 100% starting, he just might not be that effective. 




 I'd definitely roll with Amendola in that one. 




 Standard Scoring. Please pick two: Jordan Cameron vs Bears, Charles Clay vs Patriots, Danny Amendola vs Dolphins, Chris Ivory vs Panthers. 




 Cocaine's a helluva drug. 




 Just keep in mind that he has a tweaked ankle and doesn't have his quarterback. He's a risky plau even with the start. 




 S Jax and Vereen are definitely the best out of that group. 




 TOUGH- you've got to go Alfred here. That's the smart move. But the ballsy move that might make you win a playoff game? That's starting Spiller. I'd roll high risk/high reward on this one. 




 Out of that group, Forte is both the better back AND part of the better offense. He's your man. My second choice would be Vereen, however that Patriots offense is simply too unpredictable to trust in a playoff game. 




 Standard Scoring, choose 1: DeAngelo Williams, Donald Brown, and Chris Ivory.
 




 Standard Scoring, choose 1: DeAngelo Williams, Donald Brown, and Chris Ivory.

I'd love roll with Ivory, but I'm terrified of that matchup against Carolina. As of now I have Donal Brown starting, but I'm convinced he's going to put up another dud. Thoughts?

Thanks for doing this, you're helping out a lot of peeps and dish out some great insight. 




 Very impressive. Congrats, man. 




 Are you really just going to ignore what each of those receivers has done the past few weeks?

As for Miami having good CB's- look what Pittsburg did to them last week.
 




 Call the police on her. She's guilty of almost every count of child abuse out there. 




 Gahhhdamn that's impressive. 




 I'm going to say Amendola. I think he's finally going to be as effective as was hoped in the preseason. Gronk out, and the defense honing in on Edelman and Vereen- I think this is his day. 

Or he get's tackled on the second play of the game and explodes into a cloud of dust.

What do you guys think? 




 Edelman by a mile. He's been outstanding the past three weeks, and with Gronk out he'll only get more opportunities.

Nelson is utterly useless without Rodgers. 




 There's many similarities between the two. You learn a TON about the samurai and the culture that surrounds them. If these subjects interest you- this must be read. Imagine all the information that would be stocked into a textbook on this subject, you learn all of that in a completely passive enjoyable way, since it is all done while partaking in this amazing adventure. Book is a tomb but don't be intimidated- you'll want it to last as long as possible. 




 Pierre Thomas. Keep a close eye on news following Ridley though, if he's due for a larger number of snaps I'd give it to him. 




 Cotchery 




 Tavon Austin. 




 Rainey without question. 




 If it's just 1? I'd go Garcon. They're likely going to be behind and throwing a lot that game into a soft defense.

If you need two out of that...I'd have to roll with Edelman. he's been outstanding the last few weeks, and with Gronk out he should only sap up more targets. 




 Standard Scoring please pick 2:

Charles Clay vs Patriots

Jordan Cameron vs Bears

Danny Amendola vs Dolphins

Cheers 




 Sales!

Just kidding. Something you could do part time is customer support. Now I know this goes against what you just said- you'd be interacting with strangers. But I think this would be a more comfortable environment for you, and more importantly would help you overcome your fear of interacting with people. 

EDIT: Spelling/Grammar 




 Growlanser has items you can purchase towards the end of the game that de-level your character but let them retain the same stats. Problem is there really isn't much end-game material, nothing challenging enough to beef up your guys for. 




 Try putting this in /r/writing. You may get a lot of downvotes here since this is obviously a work of fiction, but it was an interesting read so far.

EDIT: spacing 




 Does he have a steady job? If strapped for cash I can sort of understand it. 

Bottom line you married someone who is extremely immature for his age. I'd expect this from someone ten years younger than him. 




 /r/freelancewriters 




 A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole (American/Funny)

Shogun by James Clavell (Historical Fiction/Japan)

Dune by Frank Herbert (Sci-Fi)

Hyperion by Dan Simmons (Sci-Fi)

I'd give two of these. All some of my favorite reads that I think could appeal to anyone that enjoys reading. 




 You're going to get your brother in a great deal of trouble. 




 Came here to say basically the same thing- so frustrated at the moment. 




 Did she have a legacy there? Is she a very attractive person? Some of the typical reasons people achieve something without merit.

EDIT: Spelling 
























 I'm calling this now, and I hope I'm wrong, but I'm worried they're going to screw up the scene of Tyrion strangling Shea.

Either it won't happen at all, or it'll be a lot more tame. Seems like something the producers would deem "too brutal" for one of the show's hero's to do. 




 It's not the same company. Squaresoft is dead. The franchise has changed and will never be the same. We must look elsewhere. 









 That's awesome- congrats  




 Going by how many rings Eli churns out I'd say he's making the most of that dough, compared to let's say...Aaron Rodgers. 




 Cool! 




 Specifically I'm looking to buy some protein powder. Is there somewhere I can go to get a reasonable deal on this? Or is taking the train all the way uptown to Cosco my only option? 




 Tuck rule. 









 Do you have a link to fangraphs write up on him? 

Can't find it. 




 Concerned the tofu may go bad, only cooked with it a few times. 









 My girlfriend wants to start gymmin it regularly and has asked me to help her along. I consider myself pretty well versed in the fitness world, yet find myself a little at a loss when approaching advise for her. Is there a specific routine someone can link me to that I can read up on, or just advise in general. As far as her goals: lose weight and tone up, generally just be healthier.

Thanks! 




 The best sushi I've had in manhattan is at Sen (flatiron district), keep it mind it's a bit expensive.

 After Lawrie's three run jack, he's dapping people up in the dugout, reaches Melky, and the two of them grab eachother by the sides of the head and just start screaming excitedly at one another. It was so hilarious to watch, and I can't for the life of me find this anywhere. Help would be most appreciated- go jays! 




 Vonnegut. 




 If you're into historical fiction, Colleen McCullough is a BOSS. Highly recommend her masters of rome series. 




 If you dig scifi, I'd recommend Stranger in a Strange Land- pretty hilarious but also has some great commentary/insight on humanity in general.

For literary comedy though, everyone should read A Confederacy of Dunces at some point. 




 I realize requesting a suggestion like this is a reach, but I can't help trying to scratch this itch. Recently re-watched the film Eyes Wide Shut, and was curious why I hadn't heard of a book which was similar. This seems like such an intriguing topic to me. I know there are many mystery/crime novels set in New York City, but I'm looking for something that focuses more on "high society" so to speak.

Thanks! 









 Turn off the inner monologue. Be yourself, be jovial, don't give a fuck. 




 Just as bad.  




 I'd rather have mccutchen and iwakuma. Elite offensive talent is much harder to come by than good pitching, iwakuma's numbers last year were terrific- I'd give him a chance first this year.

Don't do the deal. 




 My post is in response to this injury news. Fresh off the surgery announcement I don't see how his value could get any lower. 




 What you guys think? Was going to offer Melly Cabrera for him. 




 Watching on gamecast-can someone describe what happened? 




 Keep an eye on this guy Karnes they've got. Was competing for a role during spring. Has a tremendous K/9 rate in the minors. I'd prefer him over bedard/ramos. 




 Hey Mike,
Great job on your columns. Razzball's the best fantasy website out there.

Assuming Matt Moore's elbow injury is serious, who do you see taking over the role in the rotation for the rest of the season? 




 In a heartbeat! 




 I'd do it. Ventura could be a ROY ace, Hamels could suffer from shoulder issues all season. Fantasy baseball is all about taking gambles- I think this is one worth making. 




 Dawg you gotta have Wong on your squad. 




 Keep kershaw. 




 I like your team, nice work.

I'd say freese/gee could be dropped depending on the talent available via waivers. 




 Great post!

Refreshing to see one of these on this sub. 




 I'd do it 




 I'm weary of Perkins simply because he's on the twins. They aren't going to win a lot of games this year, thus less save opportunities. Soria/Johnson are top of my list this year. 




 Scheppers/Quintana. I like Josh Johnson in the long haul but he's most likely gonna be DL'd for about a month. 




 People are high on him this year. You don't want to log onto reddit tomorrow morning and see the post "Some fool just dropped Fister, who do I get rid of for him."

To my knowledge it isn't a sever injury. If it's your first year and you're not that comfortable make trades, place him on your league's trading block and let the offers come to you. Any offer you get you can consult with this subreddit and typically get good advice. 




 I'd take Rollins, Jeter, A Escobar, and Gordon over him. If you already have Baez, without question keep him stashed. 




 I'd hold on to him- I'd be shocked if you couldn't find someone interested in trading for him. 




 Every team in an 8 person league looks stacked, too difficult to rate. My guess is clever trading is what wins you the title. 




 Hard to make a decision surrounding someone as risky as Abreu. Let's say he lives up to part of the hype and puts together a good first half- then yes the trade is worth it. Your rotation is strong enough to lose Cobb, however I'd wait and see what Abreu is first.  




 Definitely a solid team- congrats. Who's available on the waiver wire at SS? 




 Without knowing anything about your league, I'd find a top level outfielder you want, and offer that owner Posey + Mediocre Outfielder you own(say a cuddyer).

Would be easier to answer this question by showing the rest of your team, scoring system, and the outfielders that you want. 




 Kolten Wong and Neil Walker are better than both those fools. 




 I like the trade for you. You come out with tremendous rotation depth. Can butler go in a utility spot? Even if he can't, he can be a top of the line bench warmer, or package him in a trade to get an outfielder. 




 1. Hutchinson

2. Alvarez

3. De La Rosa 




 Thanks for the response!

So you'd recommend starting Davis over Cuddyer regardless? 




 I like loney, but best bet is going on a matchup by matchup basis. 




 H2H 6x6

My rotation needs the upgrade- should I do this trade?

I'd be replacing Cuddyer with Khris Davis. 




 Yeah you'd be getting raped, segura is top 3. 




 I think pablo sandoval is poised to have a monster season, you could probably buy him cheap off someone. 




 Whoa "Law of the Wolf" cover is guaranteed to give me at least several nightmares. These are impressive- inspiring collection thanks for sharing. 




 When I say "cue" it means it's something I'm anticipating. If I'm wrong, then that's a good thing. 




 Indy fans have a history in this sub of blindly defending him, I'm glad they're not living up to my expectations. 




 Cue all of these Indy fans defending him. I'm so sick of this classless owner. What if he killed someone? Born with a silver spoon in his mouth and can't take it off the bottle. An embarrassment to the organization. I'd take Snyder/Jerry over him any day. 









 I chuckled solemnly, whilst shaking my near perfect visage at the panel of self-proclaimed specialists, "The decision, my fellow mortals, falls into your laps, not mine."

The stirs of uneasiness crept along the semi circle of listeners in waves, from those dimwitted enough to have to think on my words and those who already shared my thoughts.

I smiled. An amused, sardonic, smile, one the writers of this moment would most assuredly classify as evil.
The panel speaker cleared his throat, "Could you expand on that response a bit, Sir?"

A cigarette of some sort would certainly make this upcoming monologue of mine more dramatic. I sighed, regretfully. "You see, gentleman and gentleladies, you look upon the most cutting edge technology produced by the natural phenomena known as evolution. This is what the new human looks like as we stare straight ahead into the brittle future of humanity. You ask me to sacrifice myself. In order to save those that must be left behind simply do to the natural order of humanity. You ask to stunt the growth of evolution, in order to selfishly save yourselves from your DNA-ordained fates. Now, I could fall onto my instinct of self preservation in order to justify my refusal, but it would be disingenuous to lie to the lesser breed like that. The moral quandary you see, is not mine, but yours. Will our society allow you to murder every evolutionary breakthrough our species has in order to preserve the flawed masses?"

My mouth held a taste of metallic and hot blood. I craved the cigarette now not for vanity's sake but to cover the death which permeated my glands. The stares that met my eyes, and the stares which gazed deep into the future had already answered the question. And I amazed myself at how instantly arrogance can transform into fear. 




 Great call, thanks 









 At some point the articles coming out aren't going to be discussing how it can be fixed, but rather when we should accept it's doom. Final Fantasy is dead. It isn't the same people that made these games, it's not that same power company that was churning out all those gems of games in the late 90s. Obviously opinion matters a great deal here. If you're somebody who loved playing XIII, that's awesome and I'm happy for you- just keep in mind that it's not 'Final Fantasy' by the standard they set long ago. So many of the 'positive' comments I read about the game are "I didn't mind it", "I thought it was pretty good"- a Final Fantasy game should make you stop playing for a moment and say, "This is amazing". 




 I found that whenever I was at work browsing this subreddit, I'd get super motivated to exercise. Just seeing discussion about fitness gets me pumped. Whenever I'm losing steam I pop open my alien blue app and start reading through threads. Works great for me, thought I'd share in case it helps any of you all.
Cheers. 




 Does this have any relation to the videotape, Parasite Eve? 
























 I can see him getting the start in LF tonight. 




 Nice! 




 How can you defend this decision? Gyorko was atrocious last year and looks just as bad so far. You're literally going to keep him rostered because some random guy had him on a sleeper post?

Guerrero is killing it. He's done more in the past 4 days what Gyorko will do all week. Worst case scenario, if Guerrero does horrible, just pick Gyorko back up, no one is going to claim him off of waivers. 




 Oswaldo vs RHP 




 Keep cueto and Hernandez. The others are replacable. 




 Best response here. You're getting fleeced, guerrero might not even play tonight. Tell that owner you don't want a bench player. 




 Would def drop Crawford for him. If it's a 10 team league there's probably better options than semien on waivers though. 




 Went 3-5 with 4 rbis yesterday while filling in for Uribe. Apparently he is awful defensively, but after that performance perhaps he earned some playing time. Considering starting him over Melky this week in a 6x6. Anyone have insight into this? 




 Travis could be legit this year. Check out today's buy/sell column at razzball.com he's the front runner on it. 




 You're overthinking, as the season goes on it their starts will disperse, contract, etc.

Squad looks good, congrats on starting up fbb! 




 Honestly it's too hard to tell, improvement would probably be negligible, the guys on your squad look fine. If it's your first year congratulations. Read up on these guys, if one of the waiver wire dudes seems more intriguing for some reason, scoop him. I'd probs drop Quintana for Warren, maybe even Gausman. 




 Over thinking 




 Lol I'd shudder to think he's that bad. He did get unlucky last year. He's also like what, 24? Apparently he worked his ass off this offseason. I had him in 2013 so will forever have a soft spot for the little guy. 




 Pretty encouraging projections for him actually. Check out what fangraphs says about him, looks like he could be a great sleeper this year. 




 I love segura this year. I think he's due for a big bounce back. Hopefully the brewers trade him so he gets into a better lineup. I expect him to be hitting at the top of the order by May. 




 He got very lucky last year. Look him up on fangraphs there's a good amount of material on how his peripherals screamed regression for this year. Still a good player, just probably won't repeat last years effectiveness. I'd try to deal him to someone looking to buy low.

EDIT: I still think he's better than the waiver wire fellas you mentioned  




 I wish, too. Unfortunately he was part of the Craig Kimbrel trade, might get called up in Atlanta soon though. 









 Who's his replacement? 




 Why'd you leave cbs? You were easily the best analyst they had. 




 Baez taking over at 2nd then? 




 I assume this means Baez is being brought up? 









 Is jean segura available?  




 How would you rank Joc Pederson, Marcell Ozuna and Charlie Blackmon for 2015?  




 Great post, wasn't aware of a lot of these performances.

Why the sell high on Cespedes? Peripheral stat analysis I've read says he could hit a ton of bombs this year. 




 H2H categories. AVG RBI RUN SB SLG

This is a non-keeper league. I keep reading high rankings on Ozuna and I don't really understand it. 25 HR with a 260 average and negligible speed? Doesn't do it for me. Blackmon the concern is he might platoon at his position and his stats outside of coors are underwhelming. Pederson obviously has the highest ceiling, but will have the struggles of a rookie. 

Right now I'm leaning towards Blackmon and Pederson. 




 Well said. I wouldn't be surprised if managers have been tempted to do that but stopped themselves due to the barrage of media questions that would ensue. 
Have you closer shut out the 7thing inning only to have another arm blow it in the 9th? No one wants to step up to the podium after that. 




 Don't know who Donnie is, sounds like a swell dude.. 

Talking to a guy at work whose a dodgers fan about this, figured I'd see if the sub had any extra info. 




 I'd vote give it to the hottest arm in Paco Rodroguez. While a small sample size his minor league numbers are dope, worth giving this kid a shot. 




 Deepest apologies for the pun in the title. For the sake of the post, let's say committee isn't an option(even though that's the most likely outcome). 




 Oh my bad, I thought you hadn't drafted yet and you'd be losing your 7th. I'd rather have altuve then, unless your pitching rotation is in dire need of an upgrade. 




 I'm with you, keep Harvey. Could be a stud and be with you for the next few years of your league. Losing a 7th round pick for altuve is a big opportunity cost, and you have above average2B in Wong as replacement. Stick with your boy, he's trying to deal altuve for a reason. 




 Yeah he could be a solid rookie sleeper. For me, his ceiling this season isn't much better than what you'd find in most of the average second baseman available though. So while the cost is dirt cheap, he's a gamble, high risk for medium reward. There's more exciting rookies id rather devote a bench spot too and hold throughout the season. 




 Nytimes did a fairly comprehensive piece on it yesterday if anyone's interested http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/business/trans-pacific-partnership-seen-as-door-for-foreign-suits-against-us.html?referrer= 




 By balls to the wall do you mean the 31st ranked defense in the league that year? Perry would have been fired if we didn't make the playoffs. The only reason the D came together in the playoffs is from leaders like Antrel Rolle and Justin tuck stepping up and rallying it together as a unit. We were the first playoff team that had more point against than points forward during the regular season. Eli literally had to bail us out in the 4th quarter of almost every game that year, which is what made it so exciting. But our defense was atrocious and Perry doesn't deserve that ring. 









 Is there a running backpack I can wear that will safely and securely hold my DSLR? 




 Anyone know where the background picture is from? 




 Why? Because everyone who joins the police force is a bigot doing it to abuse power and oppress freedoms? There's plenty of cops that genuinely want to just keep the people in their community safe.  




 Awesome, really impressed with how well put together this is. Already feel immersed after reading, artwork also very cool. Never stop creating. 




 Baldur's Gate 2 or Deus Ex. 




 Thank you for sharing this. 




 Wow really impressive, lighting is awesome brings so much life to it. Animaton reminds me of the ps3 game "Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch" 




 I'm looking into buying my first DSLR. Been a lurker on this subreddit and some other blogs for a while now. Consensus seems to be the Nikon D3300 is a great entry level camera. My question is, is it worth to save $100-200 on a refurbished camera or should I shell out the extra cash for a new one? 









 Any recommendations on high quality shoes/underwear? 




 Awesome thanks so much for your response, definitely have a lot of browsing/thinking to do- 




 I'd mostly be doing this for weekends at the longest in Upstate New York to give an idea of the type of durability/terrain. 














 Nothing in the article on how old they're estimating these to be? 




 Nope this was the moon. 




 Correct that the main light source is the moon. This was November 2nd, about 2AM.

I don't think this was a Lens flare, as I saw this with my naked eye as well, and took a video that showed the same image.

Sorry I'm a complete noob at astronomy. I took this picture 11/2/13 in upstate NY (not sure if this information can help me narrow down the positioning of what I was looking at.

Apologies for the iPhone screenshot, I couldn't find the original picture but had this as my background.

I'm not even certain this is a planet, but would love to hear what you folks think.

Thanks! 




 Could you expand on this a bit? Not a fan of either team so was following the game pretty leisurely, what decisions on particular? 




 This was fundamentally a completely different offense than what had been in place for the better part of a decade. Very difficult to learn and succeed during the season, naturally going to have a lot of growing pains. If you watch the team's performance throughout the year there is a lot of evident progress, I'm excited to see what it can do next year with an improved line.

Take veteran quarterbacks in the league who are considered top of their class: Brady, Rodgers, Peyton, Brees- out of these, these players have been in the same system their entire careers (I know Peyton changed teams, but he's on another level and runs his own operation- this scheme stayed the same). If you take any of these guys and stick them in an entirely different offense schematically, there's going to be significant growing pains. And while there was a good amount of miscommunication early on in the year, Eli still put up very good numbers overall, which is reason to have higher expectations heading into next season.

Other commentators have mentioned we were beleaguered with injuries- this is true, but honestly I don't like using it as an excuse because I feel good teams can overcome that.

Giants had a lot of games this year they were competitive in until the 4th quarter when they fell apart.

Defense was completely unreliable, truly atrocious at times. Perry Fewell would have been fired in 2011 if it hadn't been for Eli bailing out the defense each week and eventually winning a Super Bowl.

Special Teams is another black eye for the Giants and has been for quite some time. Our coach, Tom Quinn, I'm convinced is someone in ownership's brother-in-law, boggles my mind the man has a job in this league.

Giants fans have a lot to be excited about going into next year. The division has some powerful teams, but it's certainly within their grasp. 
























 You're the man, Wesley!

I'm stacked with closers, would this be overpaying? 




 The show hasn't been completely faithful to the book, hence my worry.
