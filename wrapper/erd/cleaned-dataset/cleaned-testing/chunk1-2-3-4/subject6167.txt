 Nope :( 




 Guys this has been bothering me for a while. I was watching The Usual Suspects and Kevin Pollock reminded me of this actor. He is short (I think), white, has curly hair and I think a receding hairline. For some reason I associate him with a cigar, Joe Pesci and an Academy Award. I think he is smiling wide in his IMDB page. Please please help me out :) 

Edit: GUYS GUYS GUYS: IT IS GARY SINISE (LT.DAN)
I LOVE YOU ALL! 
























 Close. Thanks anyway, mate! :) 




 Wait wait wait wait.
GUYS I FIGURED IT OUT. IT IS LT.DAN HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT FINALLY YOU GUYS ROCK!!!!!!!!!!
 
























 To give it a purpose! 




 YES! 
























 Wow. It's not your fault though, maybe tell Greg you found some picture associated with your account from his phone and that he should check that shit out. This is a funny fuck up. Also, stop going through the shit 




 That's a lot of coincidences; either this is bs or you have some bad karma my friend.
