 I can see why haha For me, any kind of tile is awesome to look at. Plus movie theater carpets. The ones in AMC with the stars and planets and shit! 




 That's the thing about it, always hard to meet new people! But hopefully I can connect more with this subreddit. It'd be way cooler to have a meeting of the minds or something and just trip out and share experiences though haha 




 Yes! I'm a heavy gamer too and I have very different tastes when it comes to me and my friends. Gaming and tripping go together like PB   J for me and when nobody else is enjoying it it's like "Ugghhh really?". I completely agree with the 60's culture thing. I think I've gotten a much better understanding of the whole mindset of that culture and it's really great. I might even go as far as saying I'm turning into a little bit of a hippie myself haha Also taking into account that Death Metal is scary for me to listen to when I'm tripping and that's a lot of what I enjoy sober D: 




 Yeah that's another reason why I'm really liking this subreddit. Lots of like minded people here, I've seen plenty of titles that look like they've just been extracted from my mind written by trippers. In regard to babysitting them, yeah, old real quick. It's a waste of a trip sometimes and I value that time since I never know when I can experience it again. Solo tripping is fantastic but at the same time I want to tell people my thoughts haha It's a cruel irony, it's the one time I like telling people what I think. 




 Ahh the first time. Everything is a wonderful surprise. 




 Chance The Rapper (I recommend Windows or Smoke Again). Kendrick Lamar, of course. Some Earl Sweatshirt is nice too.

There you go, man. Highest resolution there is ;D 




 "I take this pharmaceutical and that anti-depressant and also I have a disorder, so how much should I take?" 




 ^This 




 DUDE, I was heading into the theater with my ex when this came out. I had four tabs in my pocket... This chick... said "No, not in public."

As soon as the opening credits rolled, I was like "Yup, I should be tripping."

That's what you get for being whipped I guess... 




 It's just nature, man. Relax haha I'd recommend going outside instead of being cramped in a room but that's just me. He shouldn't bother you if you don't bother him, he's just chillaxin'.  




 So I've always been the type of person to keep to myself. Don't talk (usually) unless spoken to, stay in my room alone, etc. Now don't get me wrong; I have plenty of good friends that I love shooting the shit with and we talk plenty. I guess it's a comfort zone thing but I digress. I've tripped with people on plenty of occasions and I've gotten lost on what to say 70% of the time. Throughout my trips, I began realizing how redundant conversation is. A series of words in a specific sequence to only partly convey your thoughts and feelings... Might be one of those things where I'd have to be tripping to explain it better but that's kinda the gist of it. But not only that, sometimes I'll say the wrong things and just look like an ass. Not like, my words are coming out wrong. I mean I'll say something that might come off as rude or not factual. There is no filter on my mouth. It's annoying cause I have to go on a though loop just to make the right conversation with people. Then, I'm a constant worrier. Not to the point where I'm freaking out. I just want to make sure everyone I'm with is okay and happy. But it's too much, every ten minutes I'm worried someone is gonna go into a bad trip because I said something wrong. Well, my friends all have pretty dark pasts and I have too but, not to toot my own horn, I handle it well. I love dark things usually and I can just talk about things like that when tripping and I'll be fine. But when you factor in the "No filter" thing and worrying about people you can see where it's a problem. Now this is the last piece of this loner puzzle: Nobody I know wants to trip like I do. They want to look at goofy pictures and all that crap. Don't get me wrong, I loooove the visuals. But I'm always the only one reaching for something more than my friends. I want to go on a nature walk and look at the starts and talk about trip theories. I want to watch an in depth movie to get a better understanding of it. I want to dissect everything. Sometimes I even want to chill in silence and just think. That's complete happiness for me. This has all lead me to only being able to trip by myself. Nobody shares my interests, they don't want to enjoy the trippy things that I enjoy. It's a bummer but what are your opinions? Any loners out there? 




 I'm sure there's tons of these posts every day so I'm gonna try as hard as possible to get through this smoothly. I'd like to order SHIT, I only have a Windows 7 desktop right now. I was thinking about purchasing a netbook but I'm weighing the costs on that decision. I looked at the start up guide and I've also read things that say it's a little overkill in terms of safety. I'm ready to learn so if anyone can guide me it'd be extremely appreciated!

-Edited because it was removed for some reason, but yeah.- 




 You know, I've been curious about that. I'd just be afraid to do something wrong with keeping discreet somehow. 




 Hotline Miami, definitely. Also, any RTS games! 




 Always a bummer when some dealer gives you bunk tabs. Had this happen to me the other day. I look very forward to my trips, so getting let down is just blegh. What do you guys do instead when you get beat for tabs? 




 Dude, I know EXACTLY what you mean with fractals. Sometimes I like to think about the universe as just a bunch of different things bouncing into each other at random. It's so fascinating. 




 I would absolutely buy this, I love physical copies. 
























 Oh man, The Thing would could REALLY go either way. The organic effects would be so interesting though. Things twisting and turning and melting and growing... Might try this. Although it might be especially disturbing. I tried playing Octodad while tripping once and now tentacles freak me out so who knows. 




 I love horror and dark things in general. I've always been afraid to put on a dark movie I enjoy or a horror game in case I go into a bad trip or something because of it. What about you guys? 









 Whether it be a microscope or a telescope, you will never see the end. 




 You're right. That's why this is still confusing for me. Dammit, we really need to make that timeline/flowchart already... 




 But wait a minute, isn't HM 2 set in '89-90's? 




 So, in the first game [Beard mentions to Jacket that none of this is really happening](/spoiler).

So, are we in a dream? Are we in Hell? Is Richard the Devil? Either way, it seems like their world may not be set in reality. Thoughts? 




 Fuck your artificial barriers and fuck your shipment of goods as well. 




 Despite the somewhat vague post, I feel like I completely understand where this is coming from. One time I tripped I thought of circles and how everything seems to be a circle or sphere.

Everything is infinite. 




 That's good to hear, I was beginning to think I was the only one with this mindset! 




 I just feel like some people, like me, can lose themselves too much in the trip. For instance; At one point I almost convinced myself that I should live my life alone because that's all I know how to do. Which isn't healthy in reality. Putting good judgement into things is never a bad idea in my opinion. 




 Completely agree with this. Nothing is written in stone, so to speak. As much as our world wants to believe it is. It's scary and wonderful at the same time. 




 Yeah, I've definitely had my fair share of revelations. But take everything you experience from your trip with a grain of salt, if you will. Think back when you're sober just to be sure you were thinking clearly. There's been many people, myself included, that have had false revelations. It can go either way but just use your best judgment! 




 Dude, I've been wanting to trip out and play this! haha 




 http://www.fathomevents.com/event/beyond-the-world-of-interstellar

Never say never (; 




 Encouraging what? If I say "I took two hits" in an LSD forum it doesn't take a genius to connect the dots. I can say Grateful Dead all I want and there's no rule here that says I can't. That's all I have left to say to you. 




 Get off your high horse, I didn't come to LSD for bad vibes... 




 So when Interstellar was still playing in theaters I decided to go see it with my sister and that we would both take two hits of some Grateful Dead. So I wanted to time it perfectly so we'd be tripping by the time the movie started. I gave us a 45 min window and I toked a bit on the car ride to help the peak.

We go in the theater and, surprise, there's these two empty seats right in the Goldie Locks zone of the theater! These seats... where fucking leather armchairs that reclined and all! I saw these seats and I was pissing myself with excitement. We get chilled and then the trailers start. It's hard remembering any of them but they were pretty intense for the most part. Then, the feature presentation begins. Fucking Interstellar.

This fucking movie was just the perfect setting for a trip. Great story, great acting, emotional, great cinematography, and it's about fucking space! The scene where it's just static shots of Saturn and the calm thunderstorm sounds are playing (When the one character puts on the Sounds of Nature CD to calm down) was just perfect. Absolutely beautiful.

Here's something I really loved about it; When a certain topic came up in conversation in the movie (Love, time travel, God, etc.) it was like a roundtable discussion. They didn't let anything fly over your head, they almost explained it directly to the audience with pictures and metaphors and everything. Great learning experience. When they were arguing about love it was just like, DAMN. Also, the first time they go through the black hole and look at the videos from back home over the last however many years... I almost cried with them aha Powerful stuff.

Then, the climax of the movie hits. Everything has been getting more intense and darker by this point. It's one of those mindfuck movies and I HEAVILY enjoy those. When I'm tripping you can imagine how cool that is. So then the story really begins to wrap itself up in a pretty intense way. Arguing, events happening on Earth and in space, it was a lot all at once. My sister started freaking out. She walked out of the theater and of course I walked out with her. Missed the ending of the movie and I will regret it to this day because she decided to just have a cigarette and call our ride...

I don't know the science of it but... Did she really freak out over having a nicotine craving?? Just a thought, I'm not a smoker but it seems logical I guess. Still a great experience that I wouldn't trade for the world and I encourage everyone to trip the fuck out and watch this on surround sound! 
























 I absolutely agree, and I definitely will be out and about during this trip. However, I'm a very techy person so anything with lights and sounds amuses me extremely while tripping aha 




 YouTube vids, music videos, games, movies, short stories, etc.

I like mind fucks and deep stories and all that stuff, but I'm open to anything. Especially serious/dark stuff! 




 This also tripped me out, especially the mirrors! 




 Totally normal. You may find that anything you drink or eat will be masked with the taste while tripping, also. 




 I don't think it's that simple.

There will always be slang. There's slang for marijuana and look how close to legalization that is. Whether you think it's wrong or not, I'll call it whatever the hell I want. Lucy is a slang term and its used right in the fuckin' sidebar. Preach to someone who gives a shit, lad. 




 When I start talking to politicians and scientists, I'll get a little more serious. Right now I'm only on the internet. Nobody important gives a shit about this subreddit or it's LSD activists. 




 Absolutely love it. Didn't think there'd be too many people here who knew of the band 




 It was my desktop background and phone background for ages! Love it so much 




 Hell yeah! Haha For anyone who's curious;

The band is Barrier. The album is called "Eventide". It's a trippy, Metalcore, concept album. Cool stuff. 









 It's shitty. I went to take a walk for like two hours just because it was killing me and now I'm back in my room. I just can't fall asleep, I just want to fast forward to when we can try again. I'm so upset with myself. 




 My group of friends has a couple virgins and we're all pretty normal young adults. You just need the right friends, mature friends 




 Okay, but I'm going to watch it sober first haha I've seen Devil's Rejects but have slacked on this movie! 




 Yeah, it could turn out to be silly. That whole "I see the man behind the curtain" effect hits me a lot while tripping 




 Cartoons while tripping are always interesting, I might try this. What's it about? 




 See, I love horror, but I love letting myself become absorbed the the world the movie is showing me. So I basically let myself believe what's happening on the screen to enjoy it more. This is what I'd be worried about while tripping 




 It's funny because this is pretty much me during playtime with these characters. I feel like there wasn't enough testing in this side of the game, I don't know. Just my opinion. It's somewhat difficult to control them fluently. I mean, I can lure enemies fine and pussy-foot through a scene but I want it to look cool! It's not easy to look cool with these guys unless by luck. But maybe that's just me. 




 I remember waking up and the first thing I read from PC Gamer was "GTA V on PC delayed again..."

A heavy and emotional sigh ensued. 
























 Haha Well, yes and no. I've had some fun but I feel like this trip has been devoted to a lot of problem solving in my life. Internally and externally. Dealing with work, goals, relationships (non-romantic), etc. Lots of progress I think (: 




 I'm more of a night person, myself. Plus watching the sunrise is just something I'm accustomed to while tripping now. It's like, The perfect ending. 




 Bloody chapped legs??? Oh man that sounds excruciating! I'd like to hear that story aha Right now I'm chilling, self evaluating. Listening to the new Kendrick Lamar album through. Great album, I appreciate his background and the messages he's trying to convey and the stories and ideas. Maybe that's a bit of a thought loop though, sorry aha  




 Received, friend. Finally relaxing. Coming off a peak. My hands are still jittery so typing is still hard but I'll come back to this post. Thanks guys, this subreddit is like a safe haven for my wandering mind. 




 Ughh, well it was an adventure for sure. First I got in the car and I just thought "Wow, I can be free now. No longer have to keep my cool." Then I realized I'm trapped in a car with two of my closest friends, but also two other people (in the backseat of a 1-door car of course) who I don't know very well. We drive around, oddly enough run into some other mutual friends and then we stopped at 7/11. I asked them to go in for me, gave them the cash and told them what I wanted. Water, cashews, swedish fish. They come back with a fucking gallon of water and the swedish fish. I told them "No! I know there's cashews in there and I have the money!" So I ran in and got the cashews and came back to the car. Then I realized "I'm not getting what I want, I'm getting what I would've got if I was sober". So I was annoyed but it was all fun. Until I discovered we were just going to a place so they could drink. I was less than compliant and I eventually got my friend to take me home. So it was interesting so far, good and bad. Interesting. Sorry, it's so difficult to type but I'll come back to this post in reality. 




 My good friend said he'd call me at 10pm to see if I wanted to get picked up. I still have so much planned for my trip at home though. What should I do? Uncertainty is always exciting, and I think we might going to his really trippy room buuuuuut I did wanna experience a few things first. Like, things I've been saving in my journal for next time I trip. I'm peaking now, so that's the thing. Do I spend my peak with them or with me? Why am I asking reddit this? You guys can't make decisions for me Ahahah But it'd be cool if you could. I'm sorry for the typing too, I feel like it's getting sloppy. It's gross, I hate it man. But whao didn't mean to get negative. 3 3 But yeah, this was an unnecessarily long reply to your comment haha 




 Yeah man, my cat's been giving me funny looks aha And I really thought I almost broke my glasses.. They're fine though haha 

Wow, I forgot how much of a burden typing is while tripping.. 









 I really love your story, I related to some parts of it and I appreciate you sharing it with us. Especially the personal details and self evaluation. I'm definitely saving this and showing it to some friends. 









 Definitely! Spread the word, too. The developers are completely behind it. I think it'll be pretty nice to have a physical copy of both games, plus the comic. And that mixtape will be schweet. Definitely get it, man. 




 Hahahha Dude, I stare in awe when I'm sober so I can only imagine aha 




 Three hits of LSD, I'm not sure the exact dosage. 




 Yeah, I imagine it'll be hard with 2-3 tabs. But I also love puzzles and when I trip I can just figure them out a lot easier. Hotline Miami is really like a puzzle game, in a sense, so that would be cool. The fast paced aspect could go either way, sometimes I can focus really well but if I'm tripping hard it'll all be really blurry. I'd still like to try just for the story aspect alone. 




 I have been waiting a very long time to do this. Can't wait. 




 Finally have a chance to play these games while tripping. Can't fuckin' wait! Could be incredible and terrifying at the same time. Especially when the "Richard" music plays aha I will report back with my experience! 




 That's interesting, actually. I might enjoy this myself if I knew where to go haha 




 I'm also an audiophile myself, so that's all under control haha I might actually look at some books in the library. I always loved flipping through encyclopedia's when I was a kid.
