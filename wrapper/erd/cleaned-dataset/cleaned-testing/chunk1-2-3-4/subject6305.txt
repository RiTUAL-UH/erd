 Thanks, that was really clear and easily understood. The video also helped a lot. 









 I met him as well. I was really young, 5 or 6 maybe and he was shooting a movie near where I lived so my dad brought me over there and told me  "That's the Genii from Aladdin!!". I, being a 5 year old, immediately ran over to meet him. As I was running over, a van with some sort of film equipment was coming by and was going to hit me. Robin yelled at the same time as my dad for me to stop. Robin Williams saved my life, then afterward, we had a little conversation about watching for cars. Meanwhile, my stupid older brother sat in the car and listened to music.

 Thanks for all the help guys!! 





























 This pretty much sums up my entire life. At least I have reddit, where I know everyone hates everyone! 





























 If over time waves lose energy and speed, does that mean that there are separate sections for waves of separate wavelengths? I'm thinking this because if if an X-ray were to lose energy over time and become a radio wave,  wouldn't it be moving at the same rate as all other radio waves created near the same time? Then over time, wouldn't there be a huge difference in the number of radio waves and all other wavelengths? 




 I don't mean to be mean

but I'll make you my queen

if you suck on my peen

I keep it very clean

and it's really quite lean

I'm sorry it's green

I got a bad gene

but to counter the green, it has a nice sheen

I'll be honest, I'll become quite keen

if only you only

just suck on my peen
