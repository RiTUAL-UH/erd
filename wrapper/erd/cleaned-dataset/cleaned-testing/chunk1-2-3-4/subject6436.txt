 I would rather have a friend who has problems with self pity than a friend who had a dark triad personality with no self pity. 




 Using a blue spectrum hydroponic grow bulb is the solution to treating MRSA infections. Treated my last three infections this way.  




 You too buddy. Over and out.  




 Thanks for link. New to redditt. Love it. Find smart and weird people. 




 Language is the greatest invention of mankind but it is also our biggest brainwasher. I like to close my eyes and think of ideas, abstract concepts,and thought experiments through visualization.
It uses a different part of the brain than language
 This overcomes the limations and creative blocks that language puts my the mind under. I invented several ideas with  this method. Tesla use to do this. Would be neat , but not sure how possible, if in the future visualization could be incorporated into language. 









 Forgot what we where talking about.  Where you talking about bypassing laguage or entering black hole to another universe in the next couple hundred years? 




 Have an abstract idea how this could be done. 




 That is near black hole not in black hole. LoL. Do you think black holes could be connected to other universes. Known Quantum math doesn't work in Black holes so I am asking questions just to ask questions. Have any crazy ideas.  




 I know stupid question but a least I understand topic a little. 




 Thank you link. I will check  it out.
 




 Good response. I should have made question with out serious.  I think maybe our universe it connected to a black hole of parent universe. Not sure. Just crazy idea 




 Who is Jayden? New to reddit. Is this inside joke. 




 I think science is wrong. It is not cause and effect but causes and effects. Science is the best we have but don't sell me that the cause and effect solution 100% reflects the real world. I call science a "good enough" tool. Correlation is not causation. 




 Language is flawed. 




 Is there time in a black hole?

 




 Good answer. Just making sure you where not a fundamentalist. 




 I am 99% sure of many things but am not 100% sure of anything. 




 Is that your opinion you seem so sure you are correct. Half my mind says yes the other half no 









 I think the way to fix our campaign finance laws is for there to be a law that states only a US citizen can give money for the campaign of his/her district. Why should someone like Donald Trump, the Koch brothers, or George Soros be able to give to a represative of Montana. Also, these donations should be made Public record. No donations from international organizations like corporations or unions allowed.   




 On behalf of the President of the United States and a grateful nation...

 




 Let out the inner animal.

 Your a superstar in your own mind. Live for the moment. You and millions of fans in your head. 




 Got too love it when a guy is home alone crying while watching lifetime movies. 




 Go white girl 




 Don't apologize but if that is the case I feel sorry for you. 




 Good one. 




 What type of dance? 









 It increases blood flow to the infection. This increases white blood cells in area of infection.  




 Cool, thought this was my idea. If we could only get another visionary President like Kennedy we could make this happen. Thank you for link. Going to check it out. 




 As long as this country had mandatory exercise and heathy eating. 




 When the law is lawless you have a civic duty to humanity to break it.  




 Yep. You understand the idea.
 




 Good one. LOL 




 Well said. New to reddit. People seem smart here. I think I might have found a new addiction. 




 Show zero fear. Then calmly say, " Go ahead, but you will spend the rest of you life in prison if you go ahead with this". Most killers are physchopaths and enjoy inflicting pain on emotional people. You have to show no emotion and remind him what will happen to him if he goes ahead.  




 I would say odd are that this is not true but this idea would not go against quantum physics.  




 I would say most likely no also but I had a crazy dream where in my dream I thought this was true. In my dream, I realized that the moment of the big bang was the moment of formation of the black hole of parent universe.  




 Crazy talk or possible? 




 In the future, 3D printing will be useful in making  space structures in orbit around the earth. Printing a bridge is a cool first step toward using 3D printers for use in building structures in orbit, the moon, and mars. 




 How can it be a "leaked" document. I think this language is a little over the top. The term "leaked" is primary used  to describe documents that are given to the public that contain things that organizations or governments want to keep secret. Not the church's pre-mature release of doctrine, policy, or future speechs talking points.  




 It is about truth in advertising and freedom of choice. I don't care what the expert opinion is on GMO's.  Many health related issues that where considered fact in the past  are now called into question. Also, the genes of humanity are not monolithic. Some people have rare adverse reactions too things of which the reason is not currently understood. For this reason, labeling and having GMO free places too eat like Chipotle is a good thing. 









 I wonder if a food company could breed these ants, grind them up,   extract the chemical that produces this smell, and then use it as a food additive. Never know, someone might convince high society it is the new status symbol food additive.
 




 Many people say " I don't do anything wrong so why should I care".
There was a film about east germany when it was communist. In the movie, one of the local party bosses had the hots for the wife of one of the films characters . He told the secret service to spy on him to find some "dirt" on him so he could lock him up and have his way with his wife. He couldn't find anything so he used the private information of his phone conversations to frame him. 
" Power corrupts" and " absolute power corrupts absolutely ".
So get a warrent unless you want to live in a police state. If you don't think this couldn't happen in the United States your fooling yourself. Would you like all your phone calls keep in a central database where even your local sheriff could listen to them. This is where this is heading in the future if not stopped. 




 So does intermittent fasting.

 In the 1980's, KFC use to be good. 




 I think you are correct. Wow. 









 Wonder how much this fancy VCR was in today's dollars. Good askredditt question. I want inflation factored in.
  




 Y2k. Oh wait. That was over a decade ago.  




 You going to fix it 









 Don't need too understand the language to get the point. 









 I used a combination treatment of 400nm blue spectrum light from a hydroponic grow bulb, a topicial mixture of bezethonium cloride and epson salt, and alternation hot and cold. Each of these ideas have some known medicial benefit and are covered in peer reviewed scientific papers. My idea was to combine all three and get the 400nm blue spectrum light from a 1000 watt hydroponic grow bulb. Treated my last three MRSA infections  this way.  









 Someone should talk about the lady who helped these dogs. Bravo lady.  




 Please be civil people our furry friends would want us too be.

 




 If China can regulate population through there one child policy surely they can regulate the treatment of dogs. They lack the political will. The west should force policy change and connect trade agreements with policy change.  




 There was a scientific study that concluded that for every dollar we spent on NASA we received over 9 dollars on long term GDP growth. 




 This is a perfect example of why we need to fund large national scientific projects. This is why we need visionary leadership who understand the long term return on investment on projects like CERN.  









 They are brother/ sister. The black one is the girl and the white one is the boy. They both had worms really bad when I rescued them. After a couple of visits to the vet, they are both currently ok. 




 Who cares. They have nothing better to think about. How about thinking of ways to bringing manufacturing back. We need a visionary
President like Kennedy. 









 Brother/sister littermates  




 Enjoy the pic.  














 Interesting article but not sure this will work. 




 I want one! 









 These pics put me in a happy mood. 




 Favorite comment of the day. It paints an awful mental picture. 




 http://mrsafoundation.com/matthew-mcpherson/ 




 Good positive story. 




 Kitty need some love.  




 Work of love. 




 Does not look good. 




 Please do and give me the results. Google 400nm light and look at the peer review research. It is called blue light therapy. It is already FDA approved for the treatment of acne. 




 I used three ideas that are known to have some useful benefit but when combine together work amazingly well for me. I am trying to get the scientific community interested in idea. Don't want any money. Jonas Salk style. 




 Yes it is a combination of three things. I invented it myself. Check out link. http://mrsafoundation.com/matthew-mcpherson/ 




 There is peer reviewed studies that say that 400nm light may help kill MRSA. I am the first person too think of using a grow bulb to produce this type of light.  Works like a charm. 




 It is a blue spectrum grow bulb when used in conjunction with bezethonium cloride treated my last three mrsa superbug infections. I am not joking. 









 Please no trolling  









 Yea and he will save 100 million in labor costs over the next 10 year from lower payed undocumented labor. 




 Good news.  




 Kefir drink 









 Super creppy. 




 True. Balance is hard in today's world. I just don't like to follow absolute advise. Life is messy but that is ok.  




 In my opinion, the body language is different in a dark triad and sometimes the eyes are a tell. 




 Dark triad personality people think normal emotionally healthy people are fools. What they don't realize is that they are the ones who are emotionally defective not humanity.  Sure the dark trial is better than average with logic but the universe is not governed solely by linear cause and effect logic. The emotion of love transcends logic.  




 But many caring genuine people are charismatic and caring. Can you tell right away or does it take time. If you can, how. 
























 We didn't domestic dogs. They domesticated us. Read about the co-evolution of our fury friends and man.  




 Need to bring this festival to the United States. Good picture.
 



















 This new life came from the seeds and nutrients of the bird poop. 




 I had a near death experience from a mugging and experienced the same feeling.  




 Most likely but I would be cool if you didn't.  




 Good question.  




 Maybe we are all  one hologram of a "parent" universes black hole.  









 The buildings almost caught on fire. 




 I like it. 









 Did not know that. Going to have to check it out. Thank you. 









 Ok. Going to buy a big bag of lemons today. My side is hurting a little.  




 With or without sugar? 




 Thanks for input. I am going to try to cut down my coffee to a couple of cups a day and drink more water. This is not going to be easy but I hope this help because kidney stones are aweful.

 No problem. Have a good one. 




 The point is not the smoking but rather his own freewill and humor in the face of authority. In this aspect, he was ahead of his time.  




 He is currently died but his words live on. RIP. 




 I am not advocating smoking. Just like adults with independent minds and  speech styles. He was a little too much off a left brain analyst for my taste but  I enjoy his
attitude toward irrational authority.  




 Not really into fiction. My short term memory is too poor to keep track of all the characters. Good at visualizing and understanding abstract concepts and macro theory.  




 He has a wild trance like cadence to his voice.  




 My dogs are littermates so they are real protective of each other and me at the dog park. Crazy little guys. They have the small dog napoleon complex. 




 Thought people would get a kick out of this old short video clip. 




 Like dogs better than most people. 




 Watch Terence McKenna's youtube videos. Don't take most of what he says literally but rather as philosophical abstraction.  




 Not the book but understand some of the story from philosophy websites. 









 Ever heard of the concept of reality tunnel. 




 They are my kids.  




 The mystery of life. I am not 100% sure of anything.A couple of years ago, I  had a near death experience from a mugging. The feeling was beyond words. It was like I was one with the universe.  




 Our universe could be one of many. There is a strange new theory that our universe is in the center of a black hole. In this theory, the big bang was the moment of formation of this black hole. If this theory is true, that means we live inside a black hole of a "parent" universe. I don't know if this is fact but it would not go against the known mechanics of quantum physics. 




 Awesome video. 














 Should have titled video: Caitlin/Bruce in 1980's McDonald's commercial. 




 And when your a kid. 
























 I read this peer reviewed study and others like it. This 470nm light is produced by the blue spectrum hydroponic bulb. 




 "Don't eat bats". Thank you for the heads up. LOL 




 I agree with you. There is news stories of the mid-ages recipe of cow bile mixed with garlic.  




 I am not worried.  I have ideas though my new theory of multiple factor science which could make the pharmaceutical drug companies a lot of money. I am not religious but like this quote one  of  Martin Luther King Jk speechs.

" I"m happy tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing anyman. My eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord !" 




 You are not the first person too confuse the two.  




 I agree but still like video 




 I wish it was that simple but it doesn't work like that.  




 So you think his man boobs is the reason the polar bear is not interested in eating him .lol 




 Great.  




 He is such a good boy.  




 If that happens, it will probably be quick.  




 Thank you. Bleach baths don't work for me also. Wish you a MRSA free future. If your immune system figured out a way to get rid of it, you will be immune from mrsa in the future.  




 The common assumption is that man domesticated wolf's not that man and wolf affected each others evolution.  We would not even be the same form most likely if it wasn't for dogs and wolfs. Some even go so far as to think that wolf domesticated man not vise versa. I would not go this far. I think we domesticated each other. 




 Also check out my video of a retired microbiologist commenting on my mrsa treatment idea. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1nITz-sww 




 Cool. I am serious about changing the way that mrsa is treated.  




 Did you check out my half-finished patent-free mrsa infection prototype medicial machine video.  




 My half-finished patent-free mrsa infection prototype medicial machine. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9FX8HK4pqpw

 Research 400nm light then look at the spectrograph of the hydrolux blue 1000watt grow bulb. 




 I tried manuka honey and colloidal silver. Both didn't work for me. May work for some people though. Everyone is different. 




 Even though I treat my reoccurring mrsa with my method, about a month ago I saw an infectious disease specialist too see why I was getting reoccurring mrsa infections so often. She told me my reoccurring mrsa was most likely not from an external source but rather lived on my skin. She also told me , assuming it didn't kill me first, my body would eventually figure out a way to remove it from my system. I could have no more outbreaks or a 100 more outbreaks. Sounds as if you your doctor found proper drug plus your body figured out how to get rid of it. Good luck. 




 Glad you are ok now. You are  lucky to be alive. What drug did the CDC give you. Been on vancimyicn 3 times. Rough stuff. 




 Not sure what you are saying. Explain. 




 That's cool. MRSA does grow fast and is not a joke. You could use this method in  conjunction with antibotics if you were worried about this alone not being effective. 




 This man has guts. 




 I hope not but this could happen. Just hope bear don't have a bad day.  




 Yep. Got the idea. 









 Must obey hal.  




 Combining 400nm blue spectrum light from a hydroponic grow bulb, bezethonium cloride mixed with epson salt, and alternation hot and cold.  Go to Blackwell synergy, a peer review search engine, and research each of these ideas. Each of these ideas have been peer reviewed to help with MRSA infections. It is combining all three ideas together and geting the 400nm light from a hydroponic grow bulb that is my idea  and has produced such a rapid and effective respose. People have claimed to treat mrsa infections with 12 watt blue spectrum LEDs. It may work for some people but was a failure for me. My idea, which no one is currently doing, is to obtain the blue spectrum light from a 1000w hydroponic grow bulb. Combining this with the two other methods produced a rapid and effective response to my reoccurring mrsa infections. Before this method, I treated over a dozen mrsa infections with antibotics. After inventing this method, I treated my last three mrsa infections with this combination method and without antibotics. I am giving idea away patent and compensation free. Hope this helps. 




 Never heard of them. Thank you for suggestion. 




 I e-mailed over 500 microbiologists worldwide including every microbiologist at OSU. Had a couple of responses but was told the FDA would never approve of this idea even if it worked. The learned helplessness of PHD doctors was shocking. 




 Would like the medicial community to do a research study on this combination MRSA treatment. It is not science until it can be replicated in many different people. Then this scientific research could be submitted for peer review. This is my dream. Inspired by Dr. Jonas Salk and a special French woman. 




 Manuka honey didn't work for me but it may for some people. This is the reason pharmaceutical drug trials are done on so many people. What works for some people doesn't work for others. 
  




 Don't know much about it. New research project for tonight.
 




 Is that the treatment used in Russia.  




 Agreed.  




 On youtube there is a dozen other video's. Videos are under patent-free MRSA. Read book "Missing Microbes" and read about the negative effects of antibotics. 




 Thank you for feedback. 




 Thank you for link. 









 Need other options in the democratic party besides Hillary Clinton. 




 Taxi drivers not doing there cause any favors. I am sure more french citizens will use uber just because of this poor behavior of taxi drivers. 









 Awesome.  
























 Thank you.
