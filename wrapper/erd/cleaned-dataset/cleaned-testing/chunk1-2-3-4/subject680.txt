 The man is a genius. He just plays stupid, so people like him more.  Everyone loves a fool.  




 Say that to their face. Let someone record it first... 




 Did someone really get paid to "find" this?   




 I wouldn't know.  I missed it, for a reason.  




 Fuck you.  Littering is never Ok.  




 Of course it matters.  




 My vote is on asshole trolls from outer space.  




 Not if they have a dash cam or someone else is a witness to you breaking for no reason.  




 Fuck you and everyone that cares for you. You're what's wrong with the roads.  




 Are you a cop? No, then fuck off out of the left lane.  




 Yes.  Rules of the road.  




 I am so happy right now.  




 Is it that horrible to live there?  




 I can't decide if this is a good thing, or a fucked up country.  




 I came here to say this, about.  +1 




 Are you passing someone? No? Then you shouldn't be in the left lane!  




 Don't be in the left lane in the first place then!  




 GET OUT OF THE LEFT LANE THEN!!  He's not the tailgating asshole, you're just an asshole!  




 I had two girls want to make that deal with me, after I asked them out.  All I heard was "you're to ugly and not rich enough yet, but if you look me up when you're rich..." 




 You ARE an asshat.  No justification.  




 Point is, this guy was a negligent ass.  No one should have to handle this due to a "mechanic" who knew about it!  




 You're a careless, thoughtless, asshole.  I wish bad things on you.  You said you knew and let it go. Fuck you. Fuck your family. And fuck you again.  




 I have but one up vote to give.  




 So, I was half right?  




 No, no you can't. Not only would the elections take forever to dry out, but it's the rest of the car that is really fucked.  Mold in the seats, mold in the doors, rust everywhere.  Water gets into places it was never meant to be and doesn't have a way out.  That's why insurance companies always total flooded cars.  




 I thought you could only legally make and sell porn in California and Florida..? 




 I don't know what you did, but I assume you drive like an idiot.  I'd have to be furious to throw food.  




 My wife is a horrible cook, but she at least knows and admits it.  




 I'd go off on that bitch.  Touch my food and we have issues.  




 That IS common knowledge.  




 I showed this to my wife. She's really mad.  




 Fuck that guy.  




 Nice try, NSA. 




 I hate that he said that do much, I almost down voted you, for typing it.  What an ass.  




 Except for the fact that you have an a/c leak that isn't going to be fixed with a can... 




 Thank the diy ac recharge kits.  




 I'm not sold on the fiesta.  There is a rather large selection of after market performance upgrades for the focus st and several message boards dedicated to enthusiasts.  




 I have 2014 focus ST and I love it more than any car I've had before.  Fun, fast, and great as a daily driver.  




 This times a thousand. Traffic engineer people.  Listen.  




 Try speeding up then.  




 One car length. If you leave more than one car length between you and the car in front, I will take that spot.  Keep up with the flow of traffic people.  




 Best. Job. Ever. 




 Where are you supposed to put your beer then?  In some secret fridge?  Asshat 




 Sold meth at a rave.  




 And that kids, is how I met your mother. 




 What about the traffic jam that people cause by stopping in the road, as opposed to pulling off? Example, on a normal four lane street (two going each way), a person stopping in the street blocks off one lane and backs traffic up for miles (sometimes during rush hour).  Why don't people driver up another 100 yards to a parking lot or side street? 




 Kind of a sucker punch, but that guy deserved it!

DAMN, YOU GOT KNOCKED THE FUCK OUT! 




 That's do dumb it gets fooled by decoys.

do dumb

DO DUMB? 




 Were you high on pot or LSD? 




 I guess I forgot to finish reading.  My bad. 




 If I was in this situation, I would go to his house, talk to his parents, find out when he will be home and give him one chance to make with the photos.  Digital copies before I went anywhere/let him out of my sight.  I would not directly threaten physical violence, but he would be able to tell from the look on my face that his well being currently in jeopardy.

Sometimes an ass kicking or threat of ass kicking is the quickest solution to a problem. 




 Not going to tell what the sub reddit is..? 




 Do you know where he lives?  Pay him a visit. 
























 That knife is worth more than $20... 




 Should of had a better best man.  




 Watch TV, golf, and eat out all the time. Oh, we both have new cars.  




 THIS MAKES ME SO ANGRY!  




 I'm now survivor ready.  




 Robin.  Sorry.  




 I was waiting for her to throw or drop it, to show how easily damaged our brain is.  I was disappointed.  




 Batman and Robin.  Batman Forever was bad enough to demand a reboot, but the pushed it one more time.  Batman and Robyn will be forever known to me as the worst movie ever.  




 Blow jobs 




 I find it hard to feel sorry for people who made millions then blew it all.  




 Women drivers  




 This is what i tell my wife all the time.  That and the speech from Team America World Police.  There are three types of people in the world; dicks, pussys, and assholes.  I'm a dick and i feel responsible to fuck assholes who think it's on to shit on you pussys.

She doesn't agree, but it's been 5 years, so i think she's at least accepted.  




 What is wrong with you?  Do you only like happy cartoons?  




 Leaving Las Vegas  




 Did i miss the funny?  




 The kid was a dumb thug.  The cops testimony isn't that hard to believe.  The evidence backs it up.  Blood in the cop car, kid shot at close range.  




 So, what about people that aren't homeless or in prison?  Is there a genetic predisposition to being gay, but there needs to be the triggers in your life?  Similar to people that suffer from addiction?  I've always figured everything in life is a mix of nurture AND nature.  




 I've always thought this was more the case with gay men.  Of course some women become lesbians, even gay men think women are attractive. It's sex with them that scares them.  




 So by that logic, a person who is constantly scorned by the opposite sex, and accepted by their sex, could develop long term "gay" feelings and behaviors?   




 I got an idea.  Everyone there hates the police, so the police should just leave.  Let the towns people protect themselves.  




 One study last week said it proved it was genetics, now this study is suggesting it's a learned behavior.  Nurture vs. Nature rages on.  




 Never worked in a shop?  Oil and air.  




 A beautiful American history lesson from JizzBomb. 









 Literally, unbelievable.  




 Fuck that lady.  I'll drive slow in the left lane, be reckless and film the guy I'm blocking, then laugh when he crashes because I've forced him to speed past my self righteous ass.  




 Fuck more women 




 This should be at the top of the list! 




 This man is my new hero.  




 Did he take the charger? 




 ITT: no shit  




 Police don't just show up and start harassing people.  Something had to draw their attention to said person. If that person then was polite, respectful, and didn't question authority and act like they know the law/their rights, then unless you are breaking the law, the cop will go away.   I've always been polite and respectful, and i always walk away.  My friends tend to mouth off and make sudden movements, and end up in jail. 

Is it right?  Fuck no.  Fuck the police, their agenda, and their corporate masters.  But, i like my "freedom", so when i see a cop, i do my best to be John Q. Public Taxpayer,  and i suggest you do the same.  




 Yes, fuck you.  Safe distance is half a car length, at any speed.  




 Why would we want to buy a tank from the French anyways?  Maybe we were being polite...  Look France, it's not your tank, it's us. We just don't understand, but thanks anyways.  




 These are all mostly designed as a one time use part.   




 Your suspension components.   But sure, drive that thing in, techs need to eat too.  




 Women drivers 




 False.  Porsche 356 pre A. 




 I was once told, you may be able to buy a used Mercedes, but you can't afford to maintain one.  




 Funny, i feel the same.  What's even more funny is i always considered Daft Punk to be an EDM type "band". 




 My wife votes Democrat, and i vote Republican, so now we both save time and neither of us vote.  




 How exactly does one, suck a fuck?  




 Bad luck Brian.  Turns found gun over to the police.  Gets arrested when gun comes back tied to a double homicide. 

Remember,  possession is 9/10 of the law and police don't care who did it, as long as they can arrest someone.  Hopefully it won't be you.  




 This is why 4, 5, and 6 are far better than 1, 2, and 3.   If you take that much time on the models and special effects, you're going to put as much effort into the story and charters.  1, 2, and 3 were beautiful c.g.i. effects, but had no depth beyond that.  




 What does something that happened a hundred years ago have to do with a guy getting jumped by three black guys?  




 Roland 




 Holy shit, i live within 15 miles of there!  I'll be visiting soon.  




 That's the problem.  Engines and oil are getting better, so they tell people that you can go longer in between oil changes, but we still use paper filters.  I don't like going past 5k.  




 No, it's still bitching and he still sounds like a dick. 




 This. I've interviewed close to 50 people and it bugs the shit out of me when they are half an hour early.  I feel that is worse than 5 minutes late.  I'm a busy guy and I gave you the appointment time for a reason.  Last guy showed up while I was still eating my lunch.  =/ 




 Worst. Porn. Ever. 




 Well, that's disappointing.  




 Problem is, too many people drive like thoughtless idiots, so they walk the same.  
























 Grind and polish it down, then engrave. 




 Did you eat the bastard?  




 Comcast.  I don't care if they have a "monopoly", shouldn't the government or some other company come in with a takeover?  




 Now that's something a five year old can understand!  




 Looks like OP got it wrong.  




 I was going to reply that all men want blow jobs for Valentines Day, but this answer is much better  




 I live in a suburb of Chicago, and our plow drives don't give two shits. They have a schedule to keep and they aren't slowing down to give our driveways a break.  Slightly different subject, but I've seen cars that are under tons of packed snow, slush, and ice.  




 This.  I already clear my drive way to the right (flow of traffic) and part of the road (so i can get in and out of the driveway), but my driveway is always full of snow again when the plow comes through.  




 The problem is some people CAN'T get vaccinated, due to being too young, too sick with something else, or allergic.  It's the people that CHOOSE that are putting the people that CAN'T in danger.  




 That's the point of getting vacancies, so you don't get said diseases.   




 Do you want to drive in the road with uninsured drivers?  




 I don't know why, but the last line made me genuinely laugh out loud.  




 The other day = within the last year 




 I like how the show seems to be taking a slightly different path than the books.  




 Do you want spoilers? Because that is how you get spoilers.  




 If you think that really fixed your problem, you're going to have a bad time.  




 Shut down or not, the core needs a constant supply of water to keep it cool.  No water being pumped in, the core will overheat and meltdown.  Source - Life After People.  




 Nuclear power plant melt down.  Without constant maintenance, every single one of those plants are ticking time bombs.  




 I hope you fall deeply in love, then get cheated on, and catch an STD.    




 Drugs are bag, mkay. 




 When i delivered pizza I did that shit all the time.  




 No, fuck you.  




 My wife got a $400 dye job and hair cut, so I got a $400 putter.  




 Looks painful. But why is he smiling?  




 All that, and in the end, i would say it was a failed attempt.  I want my six and a half minutes back.  




 Why doesn't Bob get fired for stealing in both cases?  




 Lots of people don't know that it's then coolant that also provides the heat.  If your coolant isn't good, neither is the heat.  




 An O2 sensor is a pretty hardy device, and they don't go bad that often. If you're getting a bad signal from the O2 sensor, it means you have an emissions problem.  Changing the sensor isn't going to fix anything.  




 I always tell people, a bad signal doesn't mean a bad O2 sensor. 




 Chicago land? We could use a second.  




 I see a cartoon old fashion steam train. 




 I always wonder how people this dumb survived on their own.  




 I told my wife that i jerk off once a day (at least), if she doesn't want me to masterbate then she should do something about it everyday, if not, live with it.  




 Eat some and find out. 




 I was a little sick, and taking a piss when i felt a fart coming on... 




 I'd watch it.  




 Bush haters don't want to hear this.  




 I thought the people didn't have Internet.  So what does the government care if they use up all the bandwidth?  




 Not fancy, ST.  It's the sport addition, part of the old SVT racing team.  




 You don't know anything about the ST, do you?  




 The Focus ST comes with these seats, so why not get a matching baby seat.  




 How else do you brine a whole pig?  




 Yeah, but he got kicked out of the band for doing too much LSD. 




 Fuck you. That is all.  




 Love that movie.  I use that quote all the time irl, and no one gets it.  




 Very dangerous if you're driving around with munitions strapped to the top of your boat... 




 Do you want hate mail? This is how you get hate mail.  




 Just because it's legal, doesn't mean it's Ok.  




 What do you mean, "if"? They clearly are.  




 Who cares what the guy wants, some chick wants to fuck.  




 What state? I want to make a note to avoid that and all the states that touch that state. And maybe the ones that touch those... 




 How is this person still alive? I'm picturing a person who can't figure out how to get food in their mouth.   




 Pcp is a hell of a drug.  
























 AWD = all wheel drive, which is all the wheels turning at the same time.  They're all driven off the same engine and same
 transfer case.  Now that you know that, here is the second part...  Different sized tires on one car, have to spin at different RPM's in order to turn at the same speed.  Add those together and you have a problem for transfer cases. 




 Ironic that it wasn't eating...  seems like he was playing the long game to get a taste of human.  




 Doesn't matter, got arm back.  




 That, actually makes a lot of sense.  




 It being made by EA. 




 I don't know how to do a spoiler tag.  But you can't believe everything to hear or read.  




 You shut your dirty mouth, with that jumped the shark nonsense!  




 Please explain this guys problem then... 




 I had an argument with someone on here, and they swore there was noting in meth that harms you or destroys teeth, that it was poor hygiene.   Some people are idiots.    




 I don't care how much EA sucks, I'm going to give them my money!  




 I wouldn't go.  




 The rich hide and move their money to avoid this tax anyways. That's what trust funds and lots of foundations are all about.  Now they don't have to do this.  If this hurts anyone, it's going to hurt all the tax and estate lawyers. 




 Yeah, I would now encourage my kids to make as much noise as possible, and save that letter to show the police when they show up. I would then ask them to file a harassment charge on said "neighbor".  God save said person if they decided to not call the police and try to confront my kids themselves.  I'll be the first one to give someone a dirty look if their kids are acting up in public when it's not appropriate, but I'll be dead in the grave before someone tells me how to act in my own god dammed yard!  




 I would go outside and make as much noise as possible, during daylight hours.  Fuck that person.  




 Then why doesn't it dissolve sugar?  




 So gas will dissolve Styrofoam, but not sugar?  




 If you don't mind, I'm just gong to slowly masterbate.  




 Fall out, i killed everyone.  




 Third time?  Filthy casual.   




 I don't start shit, but if you hit me, I'm going to finish it. Period. 




 How about you just move over to the right?  




 This cop would of be justified in shooting that uppity bitch.  




 Las Vegas.  Hover damn will give us easy power.  




 Better question, why do you walk so slow and in my way?  Make way for the tallest, peasants!  




 I remember when this was a thing.  




 No mention of Dag's?  




 I've always thought that people that get drugged are completely out of it.  As in, she wouldn't of gotten into her vehicle and gotten in the freeway.  




 Even if she wasn't drunk or on illegal drugs, it is illegal it sleep in the middle of the freeway then refuse a police order to "stop". 




 I pick a different spot  




 Photoshop or perspective?  




 How does he think his "zero emission" vehicles get recharged?  Most of the power in America comes from coal fired plants.  




 Be more confident, pick up on the signs from the girls, and have sex with them all.  




 You evil bastard.  




 Right or wrong, when a person with a gun tells you to "get down", you listen and show them your best dance moves.  Don't be shy, it could cost you your life.  




 Ok dude...  you're clearly a fucking jackass.  If you think meth isn't dangerous, and all the people dying from that shit is because they don't take care of themselves, then I'm not going to keep arguing.  Like I was told years ago, never argue with an idiot.  And I'll take all the down votes.  Clearly redit is a bunch of loopy liberals who will believe anything.  




 You smoked for a few years.  Good for you, you got lucky, so far.  I'll bet money that you'll have health problems in the future.   If you would of kept using, you would of developed issues.  I had a good friend who used for years.  He was a super clean freak, showered, shaved,  brushed his teeth and everything, but his teeth were bad and getting worse, he was always breaking out in sores, and he eventually blew his brains out.  The shit some pharmaceutical company makes in a lab is NOTHING like street meth.  Nothing. If you think it is, then go back to doing meth, and check in with me in 10 years, if you can.  Meth will destroy your internal organs too. Can't blame that on poor hygiene.   




 Are you an idiot or in denial?  Meth will eat away every part of your body that it touches.  Why do you think peoples teeth fall out? Why do you think doing meth for 10 years ages people 30+ years?  And don't give me any shit about how it's all the bad shit they put in meth to cut it.  There isn't really such a thing as pure meth that anyone on the street is going to find.  




 It has nothing to do with skin color, it's the culture.  




 You sure do have a lot of free time on your hands.  




 That girl looks a little young.  




 Who?  




 Three.  Shouldn't it be "an"?  




 The correct response "I'll fix it for free and give you money!" 




 Hornets and spiders 




 Friends come and go, doesn't matter, had sex.   




 Sorry, but that's not how it works.  Wing man breaks the ice.  If you can't close the deal or the female chooses the wing man, then you're SOL.  Try looking in the mirror before blaming others for your issues.  




 Any woman can get laid anytime they want. Just find a horny and desperate man.  

But can a woman land a guy that's better looking, with her personality, the way men can?  Usually not. 

But I've seen plenty of people hooking up at closing time, that would never be with said person in another situation.  Late night and alcohol can do wonders for everyone.  




 I'm only going to break the ice, if you can't close the deal, you don't need a wingman, you need a hooker.  




 Bull.  I'm not a pretty man, but I've had plenty of one night stands, where I get the girl with my humor and wit.  Make them laugh and your golden.  




 If you can't close the deal, why should he have to miss out on some strange? Grow a pair.  




 Are you God or the police? No.  Then get off your high horse and out of the left lane.  




 STAY IN THE RIGHT LANE THEN, NOT SORRY.  




 Ever consider not being in that lane in the first place.  You slow passive drives need to just say in the right lane.
