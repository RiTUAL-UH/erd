 it's running a bit better but still pretty bad lag in some parts

they need to fix it so there is no lag runner games like these can't have stuttering/lag issues makes it unplayable  




 lag has always been a issue with the game but i ever had it as badly as i am now after the latest update

horrendously lagging like a son of a bitch causing me to die a lot (even losing a 250 combo just before the boss!!!)

i'm on android  galaxy S5 




 would be nice

i can say though top 999 needs a score of at least 2.5/3 million 




 friend requests pile up with no option to reject and no option to remove current friends

seems like something that should of been put into the game a long time ago
 




 noticed that after i posted i checked my bulletproof and it needs 600 to get to the 5th star

complete waste of ISO 




 just noticed that the bronze medal is 50 ISO-8 (100-999th place)

you need to get over 2 million to get it though i got 1.7 million yesterday and made it 740th place by the morning i was down to about 1100-1200th place

quite hard for me to get more than 2 million with a 28 multiplier but at least the chance to win a lot is ISO is back 




 3.4 million for me in this event placed me in 14th place 




 it's a waste of ISO-8 IMO but if you have the money to burn it will be at the bottom of the screen if you don't have the necessary card for it

if i'm not mistaken it's like 200 ISO-8 to rank up a six star spider.. that much ISO-8 could buy you 16 discount premium portals 




 most games like this don't do it for the powerups especially when the vials have no other use (as of yet)

the game already makes you use premium currency to buy the portals which is the most important thing to upgrade your spiderman..

you have to use a lot of it if you're unlucky like me and never get the spider you need 




 that one actually sounds good but i don't think i've ever got a ben riley one

lost many combos the extra 4 seconds sounds pretty good 




 starting with 10x counter is pretty useless.. using a spider that gives +1 on near miss or +1 when you kill a enemy over the course of even a short run will give much more then the 10 from the beginning. 




 they shouldn't have a event portal as a prize if it isn't ready from the beginning of the event

often if you unlock it before it's ready you don't get it when it is 




 my favourite 2 are the +1 near miss and +1 for enemy kill (battle damaged and bulletproof spiders)

i find for me they are the only 2 that are worthwhile and can build a huge combo

 




 got to the point where i bought the 80,000 vial upgrade only to realise if you want to upgrade it again you need to spend ISO-8

what is the point of vials if you can't upgrade the powerups all the way? literally that's all the vials can buy (except when you spend 500 when you want to waste a useless spiderman to add more xp to another)

why couldn't they of just made them even more expensive (like 160,000 vials then 250k or whatever.. 




 i watched a few youtuve videos of the gameplay and it just look like a updated 2013

also the engine sounds are terrible and sound nothing like the real 2014 cars 




 didn't get my event portal after getting 20k in the event before it finished.. (event portal was available when i got 20k)

the game has been really glitchy lately 




 pretty sure that's what we're stuck with now.. 

i'm in the same boat i'll get a score good enough to stay within the bronze medal then leave it for the day 




 i think they should people you up against people of a similar level atm it's just the level 90's winning everything 




 always wondered why they don't give 1-3 clams when you level up in the game 




 they changed the rank required for silver medal it's now 10-99 (bronze is 100-9999) not only impossible for those with lower multipliers but a bit unfair on people who get high scores that get screwed over with a bronze medal

i think they increased it because it's 50 ISO-8 but it's hard to achieve
i wouldn't mind if it was less ISO-8 so more people could actually have a chance to earn it 









 i wish it was only at the beginning for me i've lost at least 3 100 combos in the last few days and always before one of the bosses since it just doesn't recognise some of the near misses 




 is anyone else having issues with near misses? for me it doesn't register some of the near misses which has caused me to lose 100+ combos i'm even incredibly close to the objects when this happens

only happens a few times during the runs but it's incredibly frustrating to lose a combo because of it 




 think i know the part you're talking about it's got me a fair few times 




 whenever i die in this game it's always on the easiest part of the track.. like jumping to early or late or going for the near miss combo and just screwing it up

when the track is full of stuff dropping and enemies everywhere i never seem to screw it up only on the easy parts. 




 i hate the level up system.. either pay iso-8 or wait til you get the same card and then waste 2 similar cards to level up and you have to do that EACH TIME!!!!! obviously geared to get you to pay for iso-8

because of this there are people with level 90 spiders already (or they hack) and they just own the leader board because of the score multiplier.. you just can't compete with them if you have a 7 score multiplier  




 yer i got 3rd in the event and won him.. going to be a royal cunt to rank him up though 




 it will be the death of the game when a large majority of people who don't want to pay $100's of dollars to rank up spiderman stop playing 




 i hate the rank up system in the game and have been playing nothing but events lately because i've hit a road block needing a level 35 spiderman to continue.. 

even that sucks because there is a few people with level 90 spiderman that i have no chance to match their scores of 1-3 million with my level 30 spiderman with a much lower score multiplier 

game is massively geared to get you to pay for iso-8 for instant rank up or to get the right premium spiderman to continue 




 it's the worst rank up system.. so clearly designed to get you to spend money on iso-8

would take months to save up enough of it to buy the premium cards and get them for ranking 




 they should have a event that's based on how far you get not the score 




 been playing them a lot recently as it's all i can do and probably the best way to make any currency

hard to get in the top 10.. people with scores of a million or more i'm lucky to get 250k before stupidly stuffing up on something easy 




 downloaded it the other day it was fun at first but when you get up to the missions that require a level 35 spiderman the game gets ridiculous

the amount of iso-8 you need to level up is ridiculous and you got to be lucky to get 4-5 of the same premium card and another 2 to level them up

obviously geared to get people to pay otherwise it would take months to even get enough (other endless runner games aren't this bad)

takes away from the fun of the game when you hit a roadblock like this

  




 i hardly ever get battery drops so i have to wait the 4 hours for one zap and in that time he appears on more buildings

got like 3 in my town right now (one on a building i need) and just not getting any batteries

really don't want to spend clams getting them because they are a bit overpriced.

how often do you guys get battery drops? 




 not even close although i haven't been playing much recently.. i'm finding it more of a chore to unlock him then fun and it's only going to get worse when higher level characters are released. 




 they are a bunch of idiots 




 ferrari staying out 




 i think ricciardo will win this one just have a feeling hamiltons tyres won't last and he'll pit or ricciardo will get him with the fresh tyres.. 




 i have a feeling Hamilton will have to pit again 




 those clouds look pretty evil i wonder if rain will hit before the end 




 i wonder if the conspiracy theorist hamilton fans will claim the spin was because of sabotage of the brakes they seem to think everything bad that happens to his car is sabotage 




 they are cold because he had to start from the pits 




 3 weeks really isn't that long between events, if you don't use clams you have to grind them out collecting whatever and to me the game is becoming more of a chore then fun

they should space big events out by at least 3 months and have smaller updates like the toy boxes or something similar to fill the gaps between 




 i hate when games put big events out so soon, events need to be spaced out so you don't get tired of the game and this one most likely will be similar to the last with collect x to get y or spend a zillion clams to get it now..

too many events so soon and you get burned out on the game (especially since many are probably still unlocking stewie or trying to get the toy boxes) 




 does it really surprise you? they are desperate for ratings with how shit the show has been over the last few years 




 i thought they said it was a iconic or great character that will bite the bullet.. rabbi krustovsky is not iconic or great and has only been in like 10 episodes i think..  




 there really isn't much premium content worth buying and most is horribly overpriced

i'm just glad they have been giving some out for free in recent prize boxes. 




 at first i liked the collect x item for skin etc but now it's getting ridiculous especially for what you have to collect to get stewie.

i realise some people would collect it quick then be waiting for the next item but anyone that can only play this game once or so a day etc would be put off in having to grind so much to unlock a character.   




 ever since the moon idol event i've been getting constant freezing.. the game doesn't crash it just freezes every 30 or so seconds for a few seconds then starts again

anyone had this happen (i'm using a S3 but it was fine before that first event) 




 now stewie is around the corner i regret wasting so much money on the prize boxes during both events.

i have a feeling it will be like when you unlock Tricia and you'll have to unlock the land around the funhouse first before even repairing it which could be 50k upwards.
 




 whilst i am playing the game will freeze for a few seconds then go back to normal then it will do it again 20-30 seconds later.. it doesn't crash completely just freezes and starts again

only started happening during the event.. anyone else getting this?

i'm using a galaxy S3 




 yes they have stopped for me 




 anyone know a fix for this? game just constantly freezes for a few seconds then goes back to normal literally every minute or two only crashes a few times but it's annoying as hell.

only started happening during event (galaxy s3)
 




 is anyone else having this issue? i'm on android and when i try to buy a box of coins the purchase confirmation screen shows tank of clams for $106

all the other options work fine just that one isn't right. 
























 watching a old video clip and bringing someone back as a hologram after death is completely different 




 they didn't give the ok to be used as a hologram after death it's different from old recordings and clips etc.. 

the family giving the ok is not the same.. let people rest in peace there is no need for holograms 




 they are the ones that would have to ok it in the first place they could sue otherwise 




 enough with these holograms!!! first 2-pac then Micheal Jackson and now Senna

i can't support this because they are dead they get no say in it (sure the family or whatever gives the ok but not the actual person who obviously can't)

let them rest in peace 




 it's like they think Ferrari is sitting around not upgrading their car at best they'll be able to compete with williams 




 if i'm not mistaken they have like 10 tokens left.. how much do you think they will improve this years car?

will they be able to match Mercedes on pace rather than adopting an alternate strategy

Raikkonen said in an article after yesterdays race that he thinks this will happen.. hopefully it's true 




 cheers.. these streams are pretty shit today keeps cutting out 




 Renault provided a gigantic turd of an engine 




 what did he say my stream keeps screwing up 




 i don't expect it to be any better next year 




 got a feeling rosberg will take hamilton out 




 yep it will be another hamilton rosberg vettel podium unless the mercs chew the tyres like Malaysia  




 hard to pass cars when the car is powered by a gigantic turd 




 massa has electrical problems? 




 he's using any excuse he can think of 




 going to guess it will be a Hamilton Rosberg Vettel podium 




 get used to this podium it will be like this all year 




 it was boring and a sign of how the rest of the year will be

some teams are struggling to even finish a race.. Rosberg doesn't have what it takes to challenge Hamilton, the Ferrari's have improved but not enough to pose a threat to the Mercedes and we have yet to see a good vettel kimi battle because something always fucks it

williams not good enough to keep up with the ferrari so we can expect the same results each race 1.hamilton 2 rosberg 3 vettel 4 kimi 5-6 bottas/massa
 




 so for the rest of the year it's going to be 1. hamilton 2. rosberg 3. vettel 4. kimi then the williams 5-6 and so on 




 another boring race.. Malaysia probably going to be the only interesting race of the year if it stays like this 




 it's on of my favourite maps what i'm saying is it's annoying to have it voted for several times in a row or only have 1 or 2 different maps inbetween playing it again 




 its like some people just can't get enough of it that they have to constantly vote for it a gazillion times

just played a few rounds of casual for fun and dust2 was voted for 3 times (twice in a row) happens every day

maps been out for like (15 years?) you would think people wouldn't want to play it every 5 seconds

 




 he'll be kicking himself for it the ferrari is vastly improved from last year and McLaren is pile of shit 




 alonso will be kicking himself now for leaving ferrari.. McLaren look like they will have there worst season ever and the ferrari seems a lot better then last year 




 this had better not be how the rest of the season is utterly boring race 




 the issue is the crap engine in his redbull he'll be lucky to get a win this season with that Renault turd powering his car 




 time for redbull to get a different power unit the Renault is basically a gigantic turd 




 the redbull seems to be a powered by a pile of shit 




 it's going to be a Mercedes dominated year again so i think it's going to be pretty boring all year round 




 even so he really shouldn't discuss/show things like that in the first place as it's a review

they are not supposed to reveal plot twists and endings 




 they need to make the movie appeal to both rooster teeth fans and neutral people (who may not even know what rooster teeth is)

if it's just a movie full of RT references and in jokes it won't be successful  




 this is more then 5000 people i think it's grouping all  players together

saw a post on the gameloft forum where someone tested a low score and got 29,434th place

this happened on a event before and they never fixed it 




 was going to post something similar unless you run a ben riley you are almost certain to lose your combo in the high rise area

hate it with a passion 




 well that sucks 




 just noticed the new event so had a quick go  got 1.6 million on my first try (died because of a stupid mistake)

i thought that would be good enough for a decent position that i could work on later.. nope 360th place don't even want to kow what the top 50 scores would be

1.6 million in previous events would of got into the top 100 no problems seems now you got to get over 4-6 million to place well 




 that's why they should come up with something to keep people occupied that isn't 30 day long events one after the other

they can't keep this pace up forever 




 they are far too greedy for that they would much rather release several 200 clam items every event so people have to buy several $100 clam options to have everything

personally i wouldn't spend $100 on a mobile app even if it gave unlimited clams i play this game for 1-2 minutes maybe 2-3 times a day.. not the same as spending $100 on a PC/console game that will give me 100's of hours of immersive gameplay  




 i uninstalled simpsons because of it family guy might go soon as well as it's just getting tiresome if you want anything decent for the game without paying the ridiculous prices they charge 




 it will be another copy paste event you can't make something unique when you are put events out one after the other 




 got another score of 2.4 million luckily this one registered so i'm in the running for the 50 iso 8 prize 




 i'm a little burned out on this game atm

king butt, comic con which went for 40 days then Halloween and now american dad to me that's far too many events in a short period of time

once this one finishes they'll likely have a Christmas one as well

game needs some downtime between events maybe release a new district or have smaller weekend things like they used to do not month long events one after each other 




 this only seems to happen to me on my best runs and ones i use ISO-8 to continue on

i just scored 2.6 million on the daily run and game decides not to register it i even used 6 ISO during the game

game is more than happy to take the ISO and not register the score

seriously getting over the glitches this fucking game has (not to mention the lag)

restart of phone etc isn't making the game register the new score

don't have screenshots because i shouldn't have to take them after every run in case this BS happens. 




 a lot of people make far more vials then they can ever spend

i average 800 on a bad run and over 1000 on a good run playing 5-10 times a day you end up with a lot more vials then you can ever spend

they should add a mystery box for like 100k vials that you can win ISO or portals or something 




 this happens to me a lot and it's annoying 




 progress rewards are 2500 vials and 1 iso 3500 vials 2 iso 10 iso and last prize premium portal and 10 ISO

the entire event (and leaderboard) is based on how many enemies you can kill.. 

doens't matter if you score 20 million it's based on the amount of enemies killed

not sure who gives the bonus if there even is one... i've got 80 enemies so far and i'm in 486th place don't play often enough to score higher in events like these 




 i try to use my highest level spiders with a bulletproof as the main one due to the abilities of near miss and extra points from enemy kills.. 

my multiplier is 33 and if i have a good run i can get around 2.5-3 million average runs if at least 1 million

other then that it's just down to luck.. only use ISO to continue a run if you are sure you can get a higher score for a good prize otherwise it's just a waste 




 the new event didn't register my score of 4.7 million to the leader board

it knows i got 4.7 million because each time i die it says best score of 4,7 million but it never went on the leader board fucking pissed me off

all scores i get know go up but just not my best one 




 the event isn't registering my scores got 4.7 million but it didn't register

http://i57.tinypic.com/166zync.png

fuck this game has been really glitched recently

edit-- getting a message leaderboard data unavailable that might be why it's not showing 




 it designed to make you want to spend money to get it quicker. otherwise you just have to wait and get them from premium portals which all depends on luck

just score enough to get them on the daily leader board or try to get 50 iso-8 and buy the discount ones or get them in events

no way in hell i'm spending 800 ISO to rank up my 5 star bulletproof one 




 i was thinking about this because right now in issue 4 it's already requiring higher then level 70 to continue

the later issues will probably go higher then level 90 as they already have a 7 star in the game

hopefully they release all of them as 7 star otherwise it will be a pain in the ass to rank one from 1 to 7 star 




 yep changed back on andriod as well although i somehow managed to get the bronze prize yesterday and got 50 iso-8

i don't even remember making a 2.5 million run in unlimited mode but apparently i did and it was enough for 50 iso-8 




 android daily rewards have changed again no more premium portal

the 4th price (1000-9999) is 5 ISO-8..

sucks when it's 12 for a discount portal.. i relied on that portal as i've been a bit low on ISO lately (even though it gave me spiders i didn't need)

if i'm lucky i'll be able to get 8 or 9 ISO a day 









 it's hard to say what it is as the number needed would increase everyday as more people get better spidermen

the premium portal prize 1000-9999 used to only need a score of 300k now it's increasing to 450-500+ 
























  they are hoping for 5-6 seconds a lap which is a massive difference on what they do now 




 yet another thing they will have to address as well as these changes

people just illegally stream even though the quality is terrible 




 they may of been leaving for years but it got worse after 2014 the noise is only one part of it

every article i've read on these changes is full of people happy refueling is coming back and that there will be louder cars

people want faster louder cars

 




 you may be happy with it but a lot of people are not, it's more important to draw the fans back that are put off by the current state of f1 and possibly draw new fans in 




 so many people don't want these changes but guess what the biggest complaints about f1 are slow cars, less noise etc etc

a lot of fans has been driven away from the sport these changes will hopefully bring them back and attract new ones

you can't keep it the way it is especially when track attendance and tv audiences are dropping it's the whole reason they had this meeting in the first place 




 the entire reason they are bringing this back is a LOT of fans miss the spectacle that f1 used to be

you may think it's for 8 year olds but clearly a lot of people have been driven away from the sport due to the slower cars and less noise or they wouldn't be having this meeting to change the sport

getting those fans back and attracting news one will keep the sport alive not keeping it the way it is and have track attendance and tv audiences die off anymore then it currently is 




 if  the racing was good they wouldn't of had this meeting to introduce these changes

people are moving away from the sport in droves 




 a lot of people are no longer interested in F1 these changes could be a good thing and attract more fans to the sport

leave it the way it is and it will die off 




 they had to take a pay cut a few years back they used to get around 440k an episode 




 they will probably recast them because that's too many characters to retire you lose a lot of development like lenny+carl smithers+burns bart+skinner

however people are used to what they sound like since they have heard them for over 20 years so suddenly changing voice actors will sound weird 




 considering what they pay them it's not that bad of a request that they be there when they need them they get over $250,000 an episode 




 they will probably recast them because that's too many characters to retire you lose a lot of development like lenny+carl smithers+burns bart+skinner

however people are used to what they sound like since they have heard them for over 20 years so suddenly changing voice actors will sound weird  




 i think Ricciardo is given more credit then he deserves due to last year.. his wins came when Mercedes had problems and safety cars

i want to see him in a good car for a few years to see if he can consistently pull off results like that or if it was just a one off due to special circumstances 




 i don't like it when you know which team has won the championship 5 races into the season 




 no one is passing at the front because the teams are so far apart that the only action is in the midfield

f1 won't survive for years and years if this continues 




 you can since no one has seen gameplay yet and the game is far from being released

even with all the missing features it could still turn out to be a good game 




 it looks good but i'm just not sure of the timeline

it's weird seeing a Industrial Revolution Assassins creed game with trains etc but i guess after all the others from earlier timelines they had to finally do more modern

 




 f1 isn't going to survive if the only good action is teams fighting for scraps

people want to see a real challenge for the championship not know that one team has already won 5 races into a season because they are so dominant 




 they have to do something or F1 will die a slow painful death 




 Mercedes Ferrari and Williams drive in a procession whilst the other teams fight for scraps... that's if red bull torro rosso and mclaren can even finish the race

many other recent years have had better racing then this 




 f1 has been a procession for years instead of red bull leading it now it's Mercedes

Hamilton Rosberg Vettel Kimi Bottas Massa this has been basically every race so far and likely for the whole season just switch the names around when someone different happens
 




 i know, they need to change it though so they can at least push for a few more laps then they currently can

that way you can still have strategy with tyres but at least get some more racing 




 the races are getting more boring now with tyre management and DRS

no one pushes anymore because they need to save tyres it takes a lot of the fun out of the sport 




 they should make the tyres last a little longer then they do not the whole race long but enough so they can push for a few more laps then they can now

 




 he's just as good as Ricciardo 




 let them leave getting sick of the crying from them... they dominated for 4 years and now want to quit because they haven't got the best car

many other great teams have had bad years before but didn't want to quit because of it

red bull is like a child that just got told it can't have the toy it wants 




 my opinion is Ferrari is more interested in Bottas than Ricciardo if kimi leaves 




 i think people are just over the domination by Mercedes. 

We just came out of 4 years of red bull to go straight into 2 years of complete Mercedes domination (who knows if the same will happen next year)

at least a few years back after the 2000-2004 Ferrari domination the 2005-2006 seasons was actually close (kimi and schumacher almost winning) then 2007-2009 being different teams winning 




 seems they are willing to take the risk for some more speed at this rate they will keep getting 6th place or lower 




 urging Renault to take risks is going to lead to more engine problems but it's not like that matters considering both drivers have almost used up the allocated engines 









 honestly i hate this track with a passion and if it didn't have the history behind the track it would of been scrapped years ago 

qualifying is the only part worth watching for me 




 Monaco is worse 




 i thinking Ferrari might be looking at replacing kimi with bottas 




 the other teams have already improved the cars and some have more updates coming so i don't see it making a massive difference even when they do get the 2015 car..

 




 they are going to need a hell of a lot of funds to do any better the other teams will improve cars for 2016 and leave them in the dust again 




 they are just there to get in the way of other cars... they always get lapped 3-4 times and are at least 3-4 seconds behind in qualifying times

they have no place in F1 unless they improve significantly which i don't see happening  




 the pit stop is what screwed him more than anything but the start didn't help 




 it's time for marussia to leave F1.. 3-4 seconds behind in qualifying and lapped 3-4 times in a race 




 excuses.. no other team on the "dirty side" had a bad start he screwed up  




 Hamilton's shit start didn't help him as well as the bad pit stop 




 Hamilton screwed up at the start and had a shit pit stop vettel didn't ruin anything 




 don't even know why they are still even in F1 they are a joke 




 he won't lol if he blows the engine 




 these streams are like AIDS for me always cutting in and out at the worse times 




 ouch bad pit stop 




 he'll screw his tyres if he pushes too much 




 he had a shit start 




 button sounds drunk every time he makes a radio message 




 thanks seems like a good one 




 any decent streams going almost all of them are screwed 




 this will get downvoted to hell but Raikkonen is overrated and Ferrari is wasting money on him 




 it's basically been used for marketing so in a way it's disrespectful even if someone from the family approved 




 not the same as putting them on stage in front of a audience as a hologram especially when it's about marketing 
























 because Hamilton fanboys are complete morons

they are the ones who comment "It's sabotage" anytime something happens to Hamilton 




 i wouldn't compare them until they both have a better car so far it's been a piece of shit 




 considering he imminently blamed grosjean i don't see him growing out of it soon

you only learn from mistakes if you can admit you made one

 




 makes sense 




 figured i'd post this as it seems not many people have seen it and it's still up on youtube atm 









 back onboard camera of Grosjean if anyone hasn't seen it yet

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfQT_iZX-NE
 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfQT_iZX-NE 




 Grosjean doesn't need to explain himself Max was at fault even though he doesn't want to admit it 




 i've been applying for a few jobs lately and found that a lot but not all redirect to their own website and ask you to fill out forms which ask for the same details which are on your resume

why do some places do this? example is they ask for previous employment history and references yet they would be in the resume

edit- forget to add they also ask you to upload a  resume 




 he may of not said it but he's implying it especially by saying he's got the hallmarks of schumacher/senna
 




 brundle has basically already said it about Verstappen

Verstappen will be a world championship-winning team before he is 20. He is showing all the hallmarks of a Senna, of a Schumacher in my view,  




 the racing and results so far i just think sainz has a lot more potential but it isn't recongised as much because Verstappen gets more hype due to his age 




 i think sainz is a great driver who isn't being recognised as much because of the hype surrounding the younger Verstappen

i honestly think he has the better chance of being a future world champion and would be a waste of good talent if he isn't picked up by one of the bigger teams 









 most Hamilton fans see it as exactly that but there is always idiot fanboys making comments about sabotage etc 




 anytime something happens to Hamilton his fanboys come out with the sabotage remarks. 




 before i even opened it i knew there would be a comment about it being a sabotage

 




 still is this is just a massive Mercedes fuck up for hamilton 




 why did hamilton pit? just gave away the win 




 for good reason it's a shit track that only exists because it's historic

it's time to retire it and get a better track that allows some actual racing 




 that's the problem it's a historic track they'll never get rid of it no matter how more boring the races get

if this was not a historic track it would of been abandoned years ago
 




 always is at Monaco worst race of the season by far

if it wasn't a historical track it would of been ditched years ago 




 it's for people new to the sport you dingleberry

sports don't survive if they don't get new fans

 




 you could say the same about everyone using a smartphone or buying any clothes made in sweatshop countries

pretty sure many have died making the things we all go out and buy on a daily basis and no one seems to care 




 people are stupid 




 also any clothes made in china or the other sweatshop countries which is basically everything we buy 




 just people jumping on the bandwagon give it a few days they won't care anymore 




 kimi needs to improve or he won't have a seat soon enough 




 so how many of you actually cared about Qatar before the visa and coke threads?

typical bandwagon jumping that you will all forget about when these threads die down,  you will then continue life as normal using smartphones built in sweat shops and wearing clothes made under worse conditions yet no thread for that 
 




 then forget about a day or two later when this drops off the main page

i'd wager money most people commenting didn't give a fuck about Qatar before this
 




 they are settling back into their usual position

last year was a one off 




 shouldn't be illegal due to the stupidity of the person who didn't secure it 




 not really a bad thing lots of idiots on the road

they must of bribed the driving instructor to pass them
 




 it won't at least not on something as big as the world cup

even if sponsors pull out someone will front the money and the show will go on and it will be watched by millions/billions

people wanted to boycott Russia during the winter Olympics because of the gay laws they passed yet it had no impact 




 the world cup will go ahead in Qatar as planned even if coke or whoever else pulls out

hundreds of millions if not billions around the world will still watch it when it's on in 2022

no one will remember this post as people tend to jump on bandwagons and then move on completely forgetting about it
 




 any form of comedy as it seems these days more and more people are "offended" by jokes 




 this is also why product placement is increasing in all shows if people don't watch commercials they will just get the show to drink their drinks with the labels showing on camera etc 




 it's impressive for a first time but he has to do in qualifying for it to mean anything 




 all depends on how he qualifies 




 nope that's fucking retarded

music is music people are people big fucking difference between them no matter what the history of the music is

i also hate classical and country i guess this means i hate white people as well




 




 yep that's how retarded people are becoming 




 rap (mostly the new crap these days) is just shit doesn't make someone racist for hating shit music 




 there is always someone willing to do that they then forget about it a day or two later and wait for the next controversy to pretend to care about 




 it's likely a translation issue and he didn't meant it the way the rest of us see the word

although there is always people who will pretend to be offended by it cause a stink about it then forget about it a few days later when they move on to the next "controversy" to pretend to care about 




 kimi is on is his last legs within the next year or two ferrari will replace him 




 honestly i think Ricciardo gets a little more credit then he deserves due to last year.. his wins came from safety cars and when Mercedes had issues

what i want to see is him get a good car for a few years and see if he can consistently pull off results like 2014 or if it was just a one off

right now the red bull is a turd so you can't count this year to be fair to him 




 sport games are the worst offenders.. cod and battlefield are bad but at least try to bring something new 




 this game is becoming the FIFA of the racing games

they need to add more to it (not sure what) but just following the actual sport and making slight adjustments to AI and handling just isn't enough to want to buy it each year

 




 he also ate all but one of the outside chair cushions he now sits on the remaining one every day 




 he would be thrown into a mental asylum if he came back today

"i'm the son of god"... sure you are buddy right this way to the padded wall room 




 popular vote runs a risk of people voting against it there is still a lot of people (mostly old but some young) who are against it

many might not even publicly say it either and can vote no without anyone else knowing 




 this will probably pass but is this type of vote the best way to do it?

there are a lot of people who are against gay marriage but might not ever say it in public.. voting like this allows them to vote no without anyone else knowing 




 i don't think he has many years left in F1

Ferrari will be looking at other drivers to replace him (probably Bottas or Ricciardo)

he needs more results like bahrain if he wants to keep his seat
