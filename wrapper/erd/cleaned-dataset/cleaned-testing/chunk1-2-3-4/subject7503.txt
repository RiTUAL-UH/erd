 In my town we have a "Jesus Runner", He's a man in probably his 50's who runs all over town almost every day while carrying a large painted cross with wheels on it. He's been at it for years. He's also a really nice guy doesn't push religion or preach to anyone. He just runs and carry's that cross.

Heres The Deal

Since 2003, weve set up and organized Childs Play, a game industry charity dedicated to improving the lives of children with toys and games in our network of over 70 hospitals worldwide. Over the years, you as a community have answered the call and come together to raise millions of dollars.

Childs Play works in two ways. With the help of hospital staff, we set up gift wish lists full of video games, toys, books, and other fun stuff for kids. By clicking on a hospital location on our map, you can view that hospitals wish list and send a gift.

Childs Play also receives cash donations throughout the year. With those cash donations, we purchase new consoles, peripherals, games, and more for hospitals and therapy facilities. These donations allow for children to enjoy age-appropriate entertainment, interact with their peers, friends, and family, and can provide vital distraction from an otherwise generally unpleasant experience.

Also happy B-Day and this is one of the best contest ive seen on ROAP. 




 I would really like too have Torchlight 2 on steam, im broke as all hell and my cpu is good enough for D3 or anything like that, but TL2 looks amazing. 




 I once let a friend buy me for a day for 20 bucks. She had me do all types of stupid shit, her laundry, her nails, cleaning, cooking. Then after the two hours of that wore off she started to get creative. She put me in a skirt and tank top and had me go to our local video store and rent the most off the wall porn (rim jobs, interracial gay porn, granny, tranny, gay gang bangs, ect ect). After that fun she had me get naked and run around the apartment complex a few times, had me make her dinner, tuck her in for bed, sleep on the floor so I could be up early to make her whole family breakfast. Tons of different things for the remaining 24 hours, pack her bong hits, call her mistress, rub her feet. Then as the time was winding down she pulled the whole "i want you too eat me for the rest of your time". Needless to say I did. That was the best bag of bud Ive ever had. 

The whole eating her out thing didnt happen. But a few months later it did and we hooked up for a few months. Man she was awesome.

 I liked it, You have good sound balance between you and the game. It has some humor that wasn't forced or dumb. You got lucky as shit with the two clips. 

All in all keep up the good work.

 My mom got me a PS2 and FFX but forgot to get a memory card, so i told her and she said ill go pick one up tomorrow. So instead of waiting I played for 23 hours non stop until she got me the memory card. Then I saved and went to sleep. 




 Nope moot visited 2chan all the time and the something awful forms before he made the 4chans 




 The rules were made by Gaia fags.  




 It does suck, but I still have my PS2 so its not to inconvenient, still sucks though. 

I swear if the new gen on consoles pulls this no backwards compatibility shit im gonna flip out. Its bad enough that I have to use two consoles to play some Playstation games, and another two for some Xbox games. At least Nintendo has made all of there last systems games work and stuck with it.

 I think this sums up everything I have too say.

 So one day in 2005, I get up and notice I have some kind of spider bite on my inner thigh. I slept in the basement so thats what I chalked it up too. So I get outta bed and start getting ready too go to work since i overslept. As im getting dressed my leg starts throbbing and swelling, I say "eh" walk out the door to work. As im walking I can feel it hurting and swelling more and more. Make it to work, get told to get in the kitchen someone called off (the other guy who closed with me) and we are busy as shit. So I limp on past the GM and a normal manager. They ask whats wrong I tell them, get in the kitchen, bust out all the orders for about maybe an hour.
 
Thats when the pain set in. On a scale of 1 to 10 I was at a 50. So here i am on the floor, basically in tears, all sweaty and holding my leg, while the other guys in the kitchen make food. Manager comes back asks whats wrong, I tell her I have too leave something is really wrong with my leg and I cant work if I cant stand. Here is what she tells me "If you leave you are fired, that's not coming from me thats from the GM" I flip shit "What the fuck do you mean he left like an hour ago" 

Apparently as I came limping in the GM (who was a piece of shit human being to begin with, thats another story) Tells the manager "I bet he and Nick (guy who called off) are up too some bullshit they probably planed this out, If he tries too leave fire him". 

So I do end up leaving going too the hospital and turned out that I had MRSA. MRSA is some serious shit if you dont know if it gets into your blood stream it call kill you. So I get an IV pain pills all that fun stuff, get a doctors note saying that I cant work until im healed. Call the manager tell her whats up she tells me, Im still fired and she will mail my check too me. 

So too finish up, after i can work again, I call the higher ups, tell them what happened, we have a meeting with all parties involved, they admit they did wrong and agree too hire me back. They tell me too come in on Thursday, I come in on Thursday and they say "we told you wednesday your fired agian."

I asked and it was deliverd thank you so much, also here is the picture of my daughter Aya gettin down on some pizza crust. :D 




 So im a broke ass father, my daughter is loaded up with food due too me spending all my food card on her and a little for myself a few weeks ago. So here i am 2 days till my food card gets anymore on it, and I just relised i have nothing but ramen left for myself. Please Reddit i really dont wanna go 3 days in a row on pasta.  




 Have an upvote sir. :D 




 Lets see the last time she saw her was about 2 weeks ago for about 2 hours and thats because I told her come see her. Before that it was easily over 3 months since shes seen her. Ill give a few attorneys a call and see if any of them say anything helpful. I just have a feeling that somehow someway she could turn it all around on me. and make herself out too be the "victim" she is quite good at that. 




 I have no idea if i can, and no she doesnt pay anything never has prob never will.  




 I haven't went there yet, ive asked my case worker too file and she hasnt done shit. Also when she was around 5 months the county she was born in had me come in for childsupport, I did, and I explained everything too them so they dropped the case on  me and told me that my county will pick it up. My county hasnt done anything. 









 Im 58 hours in and only at 67% -_-.  Gotta love the randomness of this game and the challenge. I really want too get all the items before the update comes out, its going to add 100 or so items, new pills, 5 alternate levels for the existing ones, a new level on the end. So worth buying if anyone hasnt. 

 Congratulations OP.

 I cant wait it looks promising, also I just posted something about this a few days ago some new gameplay and a new interview. I'm not saying its gonna be as good as two as it clams but i am still very excited. 














 Have an upvote sir, for a good cause. 




 I used too live in PA as a child and for a field trip one year we went to Gettysburg, i remember seeing a few buildings one with a hole through the front wall and back of the house and tons of other interesting things. at some point I do remember the guide saying something alone the lines of "The whole area has always had very high sightings of ghost and other unexplained things."  




 To clarify hes doing a NES marathon. 









 No one will even know I was there. 




 Epona is also fed up with that shit.
 




 So here the story im flat broke as of yesterday, I live on my own with my daughter so most of my check goes to her (she has tons of food because of WIC) and I rely on my food card too get me between checks. But I cant go shopping for food until around the 3rd, when my card refills. So im pretty screwed on having dinner. :( Sadly i have nothing to give in return but all my internets.

 So our government has lied to us again. This time (and its not the first) it has come from the very top, the man everyone put their hope and beliefs in turns out too be a fucking asshole who doesnt give a fuck about any of you, your rights, your freedom, your very existence as a human being. This administration does not give a fuck about any of you, or anyone else in the world apparently. 

The last one didnt either when they sent your sons and daughters to death on bullshit information that they knew was a lie, when they enacted so called laws and rules that deny you the things granted by the supreme law of the land. And what did we do. Not a fucking thing. 

Also lets not forget the entire system is corrupt, "oh what about so and so from that one state, he/she is trying to make a difference they are trying to right these wrongs." Bullshit and fuck you. If you think for one second these so called "Politicians" give a fuck about you, you are completely misguided and ignorant of how the system works. 

"Oh well what should we do? Random guy on the internet what CAN we do?" Well lets see we could protest and have the media paint us as rapist/drug users/idiots who dont know what they want. We could vote (in a system that is broken) for people who will make changes and fix the problem (remember how hard reddit was dick riding for Obama when he came here.) We could show our civil disobedience and take to the streets as a mob. (Yeah and when the police come with the guns,gas,armored tanks,grenades,clubs,chemical weapons and the feeling that they know they will get away with anything they do. Be prepared to either give up or get killed because they were "in fear of there lives.") Well we could gather on our computers and come up with something (NSFuckingA).

The point too all this is we have very few options left for us. The system has been working toward a goal for years and years and a bunch of post on the internet isn't going to change anything. 

The founders of this country shed blood for the beliefs and ideas that once made this the greatest country on earth. Sons, brothers, husbands, went too die for us we can sit around and be the best keyboard activist we could be. And you know what  I have no answers, I have no idea, I have no plan to fix what is broken. Im just as lost as you. Just another twenty-seven year old father who sees the entire country heading toward something that's either completely safe and sound that leads to us giving away everything that we as a nation are founded on. Or something bloody, violent, unsafe and scary that leads us back to when the people where in charge. Not some rich asshole in a suit or some idiot in a suit controlled by money.

 Glad I could help. Hope you find something you like.  




 Anime can be a bit hard to get into, with that said I'm gonna list some of my favorites with a small summary and you can check out which one if any sounds enticing. 

Cowboy BeBop - considered to be the best anime ever made it focuses on a group of bounty hunters in space and there various adventures. Each episode is pretty much self contained but there is a plot line of each character that by the end is wrapped up fully and very well done. Check out the episode Pierrot Le Fou.

Afro samurai - the story focuses on afro as he kills and kills some more too reach the man who killed his father infront of him as a child. Full of action, violence, revenge, some feels and a sound track by RZA def check it out.

Samurai Champloo - the story of a girl who hires two samurai to help her find the samurai who smells of sunflowers, its full of style, action, comedy and imo on par with bebop as one of the greats. 

Panty and Stocking - made by the people who made KLK story is about two angels. Panty (a foul mouth nyphomaniac) and Stocking (a goth girl who loves sweets) who must kill ghost to collect coins to get back into heaven. This one is a non stop ride of comedy, pop culture refrences, stylised violence, and absurd fun. It doesn't take its self seriously and its better for it.

Paranoia Agent - Do you like trippy mind fucks because that's what it is. A town is terrorized by Lil Slugger a kid on roller blades who attacks people with a baseball bat. Good style, good story a d kinda weird but totes worth it.

Trigun - A wild west type anime, focuses on Vash the Stampede in his travels fighting off bounty hunters, over the top villians and two insurance girls, too find Peace And Love. But in all seriousness its a great series loved by most for good reason. 

When they cry - don't let the cute girls fool you this shit gets dark, like real dark. The story is split up into a few diffrent storys each containing a few episodes. Full of curses, tourtue, violence, some feels. Its not a trip for the faint of heart.

FLCL - zany, over the top, weird, stylish and a lot more. I could say more but its only six episodes go watch it.

Lain - a story of girl and her computer. There's way more to it than that but this is one of those ones where you watch it and you go wtf then you watch it again and go. Ooooh. Mind fuckey and very good imo. BUT YOU DONT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND.

Those are just a few I personally enjoy and feel like give my half assed summery for. Some others I enjoy are, 

Evangellian

Elfin lied

FMA Brotherhood

 That ladder boss fight, that was some serious shit. 




 I'm a 26 year old single father of a 2 year old daughter whom ive had on my own since day one. I have no ties to her mother (she payes no child support, only sees Aya once every few months, no fighting, no anything), I live in a single bedroom apartment with my daughter, shes has the room I have the living room. I work everyday  im fairly attractive, im sharp as a tack, and im pretty layed back drama free guy, and I havnt been in a relationship  since her mother (and that was a mess).

Honestly at this point I know that i'm alone. Ive accepted this. At a certain point you just kinda let go, and stop trying to reach out for "her" and instead focus on giving your child the love that you wish you could feel.

 Hi, Billy Mays here for test_subject7503. Have you ever wanted your own Ninja? Someone to stop those pesky neighborhood dogs from shitting in your yard? Someone to hide around your house and scare the shit out of those pesky in laws who just dont know when to leave? Someone who can always find the remote or your keys?

Well with test_subject7503 all those things will be done for you and more. Those pesky neighborhood animals will suddenly vanish. Those in laws pants will have mass amounts of shit in them in no time. Hell cant find your keys or you misplaced the remote. NO PROBLEM he is already handing them too you. 

Oh you want a female test_subject7503? Fuck you im Billy Mays. Shut up and buy this shit now. Or I can have my own test_subject7503 slap your shit into next week. Call now. 




 Single dad here, heres a quick story.

Daughter is born, her mother isnt stable enough too be a mother, and she doesnt even want too. (shes told me I chose too not give her up for adoption so she is MY problem) So I moved back home to my moms and take care of my daughter on my own. Around my daughter being 6 months I get a call from the Child Support Agency in Columbus. (i live in ohio and in the county next to columbus) They told me too come in so we can set up ME paying child support. I go in with Aya (my daughter) and with notes from witnesses (doctors, friends, family, boss, co workers) saying Ive done everything without any help from her mom.

Oh well in that case we will close the case against you and we will have your county pick up the case against her. 

Aya is almost two years old now. Ive still never herd anything about awarding custody or having her mom pay anything. The system is very flawed and biased. 

I think its just so fucked that within 6 months I was told to come in to set up payments, but its been almost two years and she is basically not doing anything and is getting away with it. 




 All Great Danes are like that. They have no idea how big they really are. One of the best breeds ever.

I mean, I guess it's fun making fun of people because of your own insecurities, but you all take to a whole new level. This is even worse than jerking off to pictures on /r/gonewild.

Don't be a stranger. Just hit me with your best shot. I'm pretty much perfect. I was captain of the football team, and starter on my basketball team. What sports do you play, other than "jack off to naked shitty water color drawn Japanese people"? I also get straight A's, and have a banging hot girlfriend (She just blew me; Shit was SO cash). You are all faggots who should just kill yourselves. Thanks for listening.

 Matttttttttt you got some splaining to do. 









 ASU authorities have reviewed the circumstances surrounding the arrest and have found no evidence of inappropriate actions by the ASUPD officers involved. Should such evidence be discovered, an additional, thorough inquiry will be conducted and appropriate actions taken.

 




 Oh come on its not like rights are being taken away. 
Or we have checkpoints inside our borders. 
Or we are being spied on by the government. 
Or the police are becoming militarized. 

And now I feel bad. 




 Another day and another reminder that the middle east is fucked. 









 Get on that shit now. And for extra value listen to [this CD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haunted_%28Poe_album%29) as you read. That is one of my favorite books of all time. Ive read it countless times and its a modern day classic. 

I also suggest the readers of this sub check it out too. Its so damn good that im making a post about it. If you like suspense/atmosphere/mind fucks you will love this book.

 Hey everyone im new to the sub and just like the title says im looking too 100% P3 FES. This is my second time through and my first time playing on PS3. Is it possible to do it all in one go? I went over to gamefaqs and looked but the guides are split up in to different things. Does anyone know of a single, day by day walkthrough that includes everything? 

Thanks for taking the time too read.

 This is nothing new. Cops always get little baby punishments. A civilian assaults someone gets jail time, probation and fines the whole nine yards. A cop does it he will get a payed vacation while an "investigation" is carried out. A once that "investigation" is done and finds "Officer acted in department guidelines" he is back on the street doing it all over agian. 

[Remember the cops who did the illegal anal searches? They are still on the street](http://rt.com/usa/163428-nm-cops-jobs-anal-probes/)

Also you might wanna message a mod and let them know.

 Newgrounds, Something Awful, 4chan.  




 The speed running community is very competitive and also very friendly. Everyone finds a glitch or a work around and shares it with everyone else. So with all this information in hand it only takes practice and desire. Cosmo (a more well known Zelda speed runner) started in 2006 and just a few months ago broke the world record for OoT in under 19 minutes. 

Like I said ALOT of practice and desire. 




 Reddit, Video Games, Pirate Bay, 4chan, fap, write, make food and repeat.

 Well ive been in a few of those situations, but the one that sticks out the most is the one where a fuck buddy I used to have wanted me to fuck her with my gun.

Dont go shitting on Obeeze (i dont like him ether) he inherited this fucking mess that we created and he is just doing what he is told. 




 So I take it you didnt wanna see my deck? Man no one ever wants to look at my deck. :( 




 Hey ladies what do you think of my [deck](http://imgur.com/yrO6T5x)?
 




 Every damn time. 




 First off no. 

In most states you are only required to present ID when you are being detained. Furthermore you can only be detained when the police have reasonable articulable suspicion that you have/will commit a crime. 

Secondly you should give a shit.The Fourth Amendment [is right here.](http://en.wikipedia.org /wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) You should go ahead and read up on it.  




 So searching people with no PC/RAS and clearly violating the fourth amendment is fine with you? 









 No problem friend, enjoy the game. 




 Hold on to pixie. You can fuse her but make sure you keep what she is fused into. 




 You can do which ever you want P4 is not as strict as P3 is in terms of S.Links. I would do hermit since it helps out in dungeons. Also not to spoil anything but in the late game you have time to work on S.Links a whole lot.  




 What is it with this guy and withdrawing?

 It's a copy pasta.  




 I dont think it is, but if it is Id like a mod to take in down instead of ban me. 




 Chie is a fucking slut. Just imagine the amount of sausage she had between those lips. She was probably the town bike before you came around and she was instantly lusting after your salami next.

Her phonenumber is probably all over public toilets with the annotation that she's willing to do anything for a beefbowl.

And remember those 3 guys from her S rank? As soon as you enter the train to go back home those guys probably rape her and NTR the shit out of her, turning her into a sexslave so they don't have to pay for the meat to take turns on her 














 Im just gonna be the one to come out and say it, and since I never post here I dont care if im banned.


FUCK YOU /u/el_chupacupcake. How much fun is it being a mod now that everyone knows how fucking full of shit you are, and how much people hate you?

Also I hope you wore a condom you fuck.

 




 [Dont make me say it.](http://imgur.com/wDY7XwE) 




 This needs to be a web series. Every other week have a different celebrity come in trying to pawn something.  




 They fukin wot m8? 




 Funny you should say that. It's gone from the archive. If you really wanna see how deep the rabbit hole goes, go on /v/ right now and look for a thread. Ive been following this for about two days now and it really is disgusting not for her sleeping around but the state of gaming "journalism". 




 Dont you mean looking down? 




 This is absolutely disgusting. Kotaku has no journalistic integrity what so ever (not that we didn't already know this). Im glad all this is coming out it shows the important problems with modern day game journalism. 

Edit*

 Go buy it nerds. Also Mitsuru best girl.

 Because of public opinion. Most people only think of guns as bad.

 That is not true for OP, we all know the littlest things set them off. 




 Hi. Heard you were in here talking some shit. 




 What does Google's dick taste like? 














 Getting mad at people for being mad about people who are mad about what a person said seems pretty retarded.

 Reminder in America marijuana is on the same level as heroin and meth. 




 [Hate to tell you this, but...](http://imgur.com/GElzt23)

But in all seriousness though. When it first came out I liked it a lot, but after I tried giving it a second play through a few years ago the bad out weighed the good for me.
 
* The beginning is a huge draw fest.
* The enemy's level with you so there is no point grinding.
* You can exploit the junction system.  
* The story shit's itself.
* SPAAAAAAAACE.
* No Quistis sex scene. 
* Whatever.

It does have a few good things going for it.

* Triad 
* Comfy music
* Some really good side quests
* Very nice cut scenes.
* Quistis 

But that's just my opinion on it. I maybe be biased because I love 7 and 9 so much but thats just how I feel.

 Hey Shadows,

My name is Yu, and I hate every single one of you. All of you are fat, retarded, no-life's who spend every second of their night looking at the midnight channel. You are everything bad in the world. Honestly, have any of you ever gotten any S-Links? I mean, I guess it's fun not being able to face yourselves because of your own insecurities, but you all take to a whole new level. This is even worse than jerking off to pictures on deviant-art.

Don't be a stranger. Just hit me with your best shot. I'm pretty much null to everything. I was captain of the drama club, and center on my basketball team. What sports do you play, other than "fuse shit teir persona"? I also get straight A's thanks to my max knowledge, and have a banging hot waifu (She just made another commercial; Shit was SO splash). You are all shadows who should just hama yourselves. Thanks for listening.

 Burnett could face up to life in the prison on the rape charge. The attempted capital murder charge could carry up to a life sentence if decided by jury. If it went to a judge, the sentence would range from no less than 20 years up to "one day less than life."

 Israel does not give a fuck about those dead teens. Hamas is just a convenient scape goat for them to kill Palestinians. All because "God" said that land is theirs.

I barely make enough too support myself and my daughter but my government will give billions to Israel. Fuck this country, and fuck Israel.
