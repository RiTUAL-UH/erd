 Less creepy, more like lucky. A free breast inspection with no strings attached. Good for you man 




 Sounds awesome, I'll have to get a hold of some haha. Thanks for the quick info! 




 I'm curious. I'm a fairly experienced toker, but I am unaware of what shatter is; while it sounds intense as hell. 




 That is the most unfortunate thing that I have ever heard happen to an innocent person on the toilet. My prayers go out to you, OP. 




 Your story wasn't so much creepy, as it was long-winded. However, it didn't seem like she was to kind anyways the way she tried to embarrass you in that restaurant. Oh well dude, at least you tried. 
























 Am I the only one who actually enjoys sleep paralysis, and purposefully induces it; occasionally trying to push it as far as I can, hoping some fucking insane hallucination happens.... Or is it just me? 




 It says further in the wiki that you can be infected with the virus by simply handling a wild snail of this species. 




 Read that at like a [6]. Now I'm rethinking life (-) 




 It's because when your telling the truth, you get tired of repeating yourself over and over. When your lying, you are more concerned with keeping your lie together that you don't get as irritated. This is what I've seen at least. 




 But she ain't messin with no broke niqqas... 
























 Twins! Basil. 




 Barcelona. It is, by far, my favorite band. My friend only showed me them earlier this year, but I have listened to their music all the time. Just recently, I saw them live at a local venue. I can't describe it as anything other than amazing. 




 I really want to know if anyone got chosen for such a honor. 




 The answer is always pot. 




 That is exactly how I came to enjoy sleep paralysis. I have yet to fully project though sadly ;-; 





























 I'm currently struggling with a similar situation, and I can tell how she feels about me; but I am uncertain as to how I feel about her. It's a horrible feeling to think that you may be leading someone, who actually cares for you, on a fruitless journey, and how you may have to end the relationship sooner so they don't get hurt as much. 




 Lol I learned that with my very first girlfriend.  




 That Ace Ventura gif made me lose it XD 




 That was quite the topic change...
