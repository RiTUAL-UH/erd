  Everybody is welcome here, even those that have yet to ascend.
 You don't need a PC to be a member of the PCMR. You just have to recognize that PC is objectively superior to consoles in every way possible as explained here! It's not about the hardware in your shrine, but the software in your heart!

You were welcome from the start. 




 nice. 




 waaaaaaaaaaat 




 Sorry guys. It's been a weird day. 




 i had tbogt on console... why does GFWL not let you transfer your old xbox games to PC? *sigh* 




 On high? I'm getting an GPU 




 :P 




 I ordered an GPU but it's late. I'm not being an ass.  




 I have a desktop. There is no need to be like this, either help or GTFO. A brother is a brother no matter what PC they have. You should not laugh at other peoples PCs just because yours is better, they might not have the money to spend you have. 




 Finally.  




 We are talking about GTA 4 here. *4* NOT *FIVE* 




 the port for GTA IV is SHIT. Also you know that flair I have. Yeah if you want to mouse over it.. 




 Not bad. Sure. Take it. 




 Oh, Ok. i'd say buy some faster RAM and a GPU i'd say R9 280

I have a core i3 2330M with integrated graphics and 4GB of RAM. I heard that if I fiddle with the .ini files I can make it playable, is that true and what do I have to do? 




 I'm trying to run GTA IV at medium/high i've tried low, still getting 30/40fps... it's terrible. the port is so shit. Any files/mods that can improve the port? :| (If that is possible)
I'm tired of 30fps it's burning my eyes.

 Little April was not the best student in Sunday school. Usually she slept through the class. One day the teacher called on her while she was napping, "Tell me, April, who created the universe?" When April didn't stir, little Johnny, a boy seated in the chair behind her, took a pin and jabbed her in the rear.  "GOD ALMIGHTY!" shouted April and the teacher said, "Very good" and April fell back asleep. A while later the teacher asked April, "Who is our Lord and Saviour," But, April didn't even stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again.  "JESUS CHRIST!" shouted April and the teacher said, "very good," and April fell back to sleep. Then the teacher asked April a third question.  "What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?"  And again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin.  This time April jumped up and shouted, "IF YOU STICK THAT F*****G THING IN ME ONE MORE TIME, I'LL BREAK IT IN HALF AND STICK IT UP YOUR ARSE!" The Teacher fainted.

 Why not remove some of the useless flairs that are not uses so much like HTPC? 




 No,Yes. 




  It feels like I'm developing for a console :/
HOW DARE YOU? D: 




 D: 




 We are the members. We demand flairs. We want colors. We are not a 1950s newspaper. We are colorful and intelligent. We. Love. This. Sub. 
No longer will we put up with these COLORS.
We will do whatever it takes to get flairs. Even if that means pressing 2000 K70 keys down at once. Prepare your ears, you are in for a ride.  




 It's ok xX_EdGe360n0sCoPeZz_CaSEMasTeRRacE_FazeClanxX_zZ you will soon be part of us.A 




 Why can't we have a few? You know? I'm tired of seeing people use the former PCMR flair. People want orange! Blue is for peasants! #orangemasterrace 

 




 Why not add pages? You know, like a scroll bar! Or somthing? Is that possible in CSS? 




 I was talking like orange and red. You don't have to change anything big... I was maybe thinking like you could remove the color ranking somehow? Mods have exclusive color? The sub would look nicer being more colorful. 




 Yeah! 




 Upvooooohhht if you agree brother! 














 Yeah, fr00b

 very nice 




 You were my closest friend in those times. You would listen when I would talk to you, whether it was two o'clock at night and I was in bed, or it was early morning and I was on a bus ride. As time passed and I attained more friends, we were quieter, although I could still rely on you when no one else was there. I suppose that you were the only predictable asset in my erratic life.

Yet that was all back when life was better. For all your good company, you couldn't stop my mother from drinking, my grades from failing, or make my future seem hopeful. Neither of us knew what happiness or peace was anymore; they were only foreign emotions left over from childhood. Every night we were exhausted from despair, and every day was no more than a dull and melancholic mantra. The mantra of disappointment when the payments failed again, the loneliness when another friend would forget my existence, and the fury when my mother would try to justify her addiction was all exhausting to endure.

As the days passed, and change didn't come, our tolerance faded to an ultimate conclusion. It was a silent agreement that we would put our misery to rest someday. Only the timing was uncertain.

That last day, we were home alone. My siblings were away at school and my mother was requesting her free paycheck at the "government office". I had not eaten, talked or even cried in the hours since I'd woken up. Our tears didn't come anymore- not for months- and so parts of the agony stayed trapped in our hearts. Not even writing or a physical hug from one of my loved ones could cure it. I left my note on the kitchen table, next to today's bottle of whiskey.

We pushed open the unlocked door and walked into the cold world of late autumn. School had started, though not for us. We were long past those days that gave us a reason to get up in the mornings. In the silence along Centennial Drive, accessing our chosen place was easy. Few people occupied the apartments and the town was quiet in the morning. Without a word exchanged between us, we soon stood on that balcony on the tallest floor, feeling the icy wind rattle the leaves on the oaks. The world certainly is prettier when you're sixty feet off the ground.

I knew I couldn't hesitate long. The sick feeling of anxiety was forming in my empty stomach. As I felt your hand grasp mine out of the air, I turned around to look at you in surprise. You had grabbed me firmly, as if you wanted to stop me from falling. Maybe you had forgotten that jumping hadn't left my mind for the past few months.

I asked you what you were doing, but you would not answer. For a moment we were again silent, watching the cars roll by, their engines no louder than whispers. All the while I could feel your older, longer fingers wrapped around my little ones.

Without moving your lips, you reminded me that the ground below wasn't soft. I looked back at you in confusion, and your sapphire eyes stared back with a stern gaze, as if I were a child about to touch a heated stove. You said not a word, and yet I could feel myself shiver in spite of the fur in my favorite sweater. I found my feet would not move when I tried to take a step, and realized you had an arm around my shoulders. You were asking me what I was doing, and I answered with the phrase you had heard so often.

"I just can't take this anymore. I've no hope left."

This time, I heard you answer. Your voice was not faint, and yet I barely heard it through the chaos in my head. You said one sentence, ten words that rang through my chilled frame like ripples in water.

"What if I were here, then what would you do?"

I was robbed for words. You seemed to know that I had tried to forget it, because I took one more step away from the safety of the platform. The ground awaited us. And what would await if I gave in now? A distraught, drunken parent, siblings that would pester me as they always had, and a piece of news to wash over the town like the wildfires. I thought of that instead of your words, keeping my eyes sealed to stop tears leaking from them.

"Would you allow me to fall?"

Your voice echoed again in my ears. I raised my head from my slump and glared at you for a moment. As if just to spite you, I prepared to take a larger stride when I felt your hands close tighter on my shoulders. Now your voice was overtaking the sirens echoing in the distance, reminding me of my limited time.

"If I'm not allowed to die, then why are you?"

I became still at that. The truth of those words was so obvious that my mind tried desperately to refute it. I threw out the best excuse I had, my voice barely a whisper as I gazed, unblinking, at the road.

"You're not even real."

You said nothing for a moment, wrapping your arms around my body. For the first time, I could feel the warmth of your face, and even smell a faint fragrance in your hair. It had been so long since you had embraced me like this, so much so that I wondered if we had ever felt you any closer. In the remotest recesses of my mind- a place you hadn't visited before- I wondered if I was losing my distinction between reality and the world of my mind.

I wanted to forget about you. I wanted to squirm out of your arms and make the few more steps that would end in death, and you would not release me. You held me still and even warm for what felt like a nothing time, like what forever might be if humans could ever measure it. You were telling me so many things. I told you that I had left too much of a mess behind to ever be fixed, and you told me that it was all manageable and that the only permanence would be my demise. I told you that this was the only way I could escape the pain and deadness of my life, and you reminded me I would never know for sure how the future would turn out. I told you that I didn't care about how everyone would feel anymore, and you answered that you knew I was lying.

And despite my better judgement, despite my heart's one-hundred-and-eighty beat race, I still ignored you. I had heard this all before and it hadn't changed a thing in the end. Words had stayed just that, and I knew not even you could save me.

Your grip on me slackened before I jumped downwards, and the ground came the fraction of a second later. I had no time to suffer, because I did indeed have a thin skull. It was only in that sliver of time, suspended in mid-air, did I realize the most painful truth of all.

You never really existed. 




 :( 




 Why don't I ever get gold? 




 Good story. Sad. 




 During the Second Sino-Japanese War the Japanese did experiments on human-beings in a place called Unit 731 which was located in Pingfang, Harbin which was located in Manchuria. Here is a story of a doctor who participated in experiments in Unit 731.

November 23rd, 1944
Today was going to be my first experiment. I was going to do a vivisection on a subject who suffered from shrapnel wounds. This was going to be my first vivisection. I had only done dissections on already dead subjects. I put on my gloves, mask and coat. They were going to call me into the operating room soon. "Katsuta-kun, it's time to go in," another doctor said. 

Building on the site of the Harbin bioweapon facility of Unit 731 731731 PB121178a 
Unit 731
"Okay," I said. I headed to the operation room.

It smelled of bleached operating tools, sounds of the subject moaning and groaning filled the room and blood covered the metal operating table. It had long black hair and a female figure and it was in the nude. As I came in it glared at me with its black eyes.

"You sons of bitches, you don't see us as human. We're just logs in your eyes! I've lost all of my family because of you! I have nothing else to lose," it said.

Her tone of voice was full of loathing. I tried to brush off what she said and went next to the doctor monitoring its heart beat. I grabbed a scalpel out of a box full of them. I pressed it against the subject's chest.

"Now!" the other doctor said to me. I had begun to cut the subject open. I tried to block out the screams as best as I could. I was able to get it open and expose its inside. Some shrapnel pieces were stuck in the liver and kidney and it also had a limb or two blown off from the blast of the bomb. It was bleeding profusely. Scientists and other doctors took notes on the reaction of the subject.

After we had taken the heart out, the subject finally died. I sighed in relief; it was finally over. We took off our gloves and masks. A doctor and I sat in a break room with a couple of beers. It was evening now. The experiment had taken most of the day.

"Katsuta, how was it?" he asked.

"How was what?" I asked.

"Your first vivisection, usually doctors sweat profusely and their hands tremble but you did it without hesitation." He took a drink of the beer.

"I don't know Ogata. I just didn't think of it as human," I explained. I hadn't touched my beer.

Unit 731
He laughed, "I guess all those dissections got you ready for the vivisection."

I went back to the dorms of Unit 731 for the doctors. I was tired from the operation. I got into bed and I looked up at the ceiling. It was her words I couldn't get out of my head.

"I have nothing else to lose..."

For some reason those words bothered me the most. A tear came down my cheek and I closed my eyes. I couldn't get the image of her eyes out of my head.

That night I was unable to sleep.
