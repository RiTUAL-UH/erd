 valid point, wp rpeet 




 my post was obviously meant to be taken with a grain of salt, I knew pr0lly would never read this 




 I got dumpstered by a Fizz, then bought him as my first champ and dumpstered on other people because of his high burst. Then I began to systematically branch out and tried to pick 1-2 champs for each role. I would experiment on specials champs or I'd play ARAM so i'd be forced to mess around with different champs even though it was still an ARAM. I also began to main Pantheon in the jungle when he was stronger and got quite good with him. So basically I think it comes down to enjoyment. I'm sure you've read about people maining an unpopular champ and getting into diamond or other divisions. So if you pick a champ that you enjoy playing then you should main that in my opinion. 




 There are plenty of good youtube videos directed at new players that will give you a bunch of general knowledge to help you as you learn the game

edit: damn why the downvote :'( 









 Can someone TL;DR pls? lol 




 Nasus is really reliant on farm, more so than any other top laner. The current meta denies cs to the top laner. If it takes about 20-25 minutes for a Solo queue nasus to become relevant with easy farming. It would be too late for nasus in LCS gameplay

 IT'S A DATE

EDIT: DAMN IT 




 I saw this on reddit a couple days ago and I agree. It was a post about how it was embarrassing that the LoL client was so out of date, that 3rd party organizations have created clients that are far superior. 




 You made a lot of good points, and I appreciate you're really thoughtful insight. About your point on buyouts. I wasn't necessarily suggesting a company buyout. We both acknowledge that Riot more or less has a monopoly on the MOBA market, aside from Dota2 being the only competitor which really can be seen as negligible in my opinion. 

You're also right to point out that I was basically asking for LoL with Riot that makes little to no mistakes. I was just trying to think about games I know that have risen to popularity in the gaming scene. My first real experience with the gaming scene was with Halo 2 back around 2007-ish at the beginning of Halo 3.  Halo dipped because of their own shortcomings, but rose to prominence? Call of Duty in the First Person Shooter genre. Which was always in my opinion, a simplified Halo. So I was thinking that simpler is always better for gamers. Whether that be because of people's attention span or something else.  I don't think we'll see a change in the foreseeable future. 




 Good looking girl with some self-respect, but not enough *personality.*
See you on the second page. 




 This is purely a skeptical post to talk about the current state of affairs and *professionalism* of Riot.

I'm not creating this solely because of the recent Korean uproar, but it definitely served as an impetus for me to finally put this out to the community. 

In my personal opinion, I think Riot is setting the stage to be over taken as the world's largest MOBA and competitive gaming scene. Not within the next year or even the next few years, but eventually I think their mishaps will culminate to their downfall. I believe this is because of how they conduct their interactions with the community and how whimsically they conduct the professional scene.

**FIRST**

I will first talk about the community interactions and secondly about the professional scene.

Riot has historically been a company that interacts largely with it's players and with positive results. I don't wish to talk about Riot-to-player interaction because I don't have any problems with the way those situations are handled. But the thing that they fail to do is live up to their promises. These promises include client updates, champion releases, VUs, reworks, etc. Things are promised and aren't really delivered as expected, hence the popular soon^TM when upcoming releases are discussed. To me, this is unprofessional, however, Riot never gives a date or timeframe for their releases which allows them all the flexibility in the world so that they don't back themselves into a corner. This is the general gist of the unprofessionalism without going to much further.

**SECOND**

The second topic was about Riot's conduction of the professional and perhaps the most astounding one to me.  I think Riot aren't doing themselves any favors with the way they reprehensibly plan their events. Most notably:
* Korean *miscommunication* about the location of Worlds
* Treatment of Gambit with the London LCS event
* Replay of LCS game because of Aatrox bug

This is just a short laundry list to exemplify in major ways that Riot is failing it's fanbase and perhaps it's most famous players.

**My thoughts to the problems**

For the first topic, I'm a little bit more forgiving because complications in testing and designing are a necessity when aiming for perfection. However, where is the line drawn with how much leniency Riot gets after they make promises.

The second topic, however, just can't happen in a professional setting. As a major gaming company, you can absolutely not allow these mistakes to happen. Poor planning and unfair treatment of your own teams resonates deeply in me and cannot happen.

**RIOT ISN'T EVIL**

Now this may be completely unfair of me so lets talk about the great things about what Riot has done professionally.

NA   EU LCS are streamed for free in a professional setting, Free game, many compassionate employees that care about making the game better, and **FREE GAME**

**REPLACEMENT?**

Now what would it take to usurp Riot at the top of the totem pole? It simply comes down to money in my opinion. Riot has generated so much money and invested so much money into this scene, that it would take a great sum of money to topple Riot. Dota 2 turns off fans because it is seen as a more complex MOBA that can be unforgiving. LoL holds your hand as your learn, its pretty simplistic and can be learned within a couple weeks. 

So I think it would take a new MOBA that was as simple as LoL to learn, instilled many of the elements that LoL has, and most importantly, can offer **money** to tournament teams as prize money. Money used to advertise the brand and money to pay the best employees with knowledgeable MOBA experience.

**TL;DR**

* Riot doesn't deliver on promises that are generally advertised earlier
* Riot mishandles professional teams and events
* Riot is obviously still a great company, that has obvious room for improvement
* Would take bookoo bucks to usurp Riot


**Again, these are just some general thoughts of mine! I wish to only stimulate conversation and kind of bounce thoughts off the reddit community. Thank you for your time! CRITICISM OF ALL KINDS IS APPRECIATED, TRY TO KEEP IT RESPECTFUL**

 Also for clarification, he wasn't absolutely being forced by the NBA to sell the team. It would go through a vote of owners to decide his fate, but even then would go through countless legal proceedings because the team is his property. And you can't force someone to sell their property, pretty unconstitutional.

 Loco is annoying as fuck 




 The kid he called was 17 I think xD. I couldn't make out all of the conversation, and only caught bits and pieces. I heard something about him being a prince or some shit. There are a lot of pro streamers that don't have quite the popularity as other streamers. So maybe it'd be easier to get an interview with them. 




 Well some dude was just watching Imaqtpie and donated a bunch of money, and then qt got his number and called him. It was pretty tubular so maybe if you have 250 quid lyin around.

 At the beginning of a game once, a Brand ran straight to the mid turret and suicided. Afterwards, everyone was spamming their own versions of "WTF LOL" and after a brief pause. Brand says, "Gotta get them turret hits" Wiser words have never been said.

 I've definitely said some bannable things, but I haven't been chat restricted. Not necessarily raging, more or less I've said things in jest. Essentially my point is, system seems incredibly broken. 




 FINALLY HECARIMJOB! 




 WHERE THE FUCK IS HECARIMJOB? 




 Boring people do boring things. Simple. 




 Just Main Street 




 Is lich bane still the best item to build first on Fizz? Or is there a better item? 




 If the LoL/esports community needs to call on the fans to make a Hall of Fame, then it doesn't deserve one. To have a hall of fame, it requires tradition, this game hasn't been around long enough to prove it deserves something as prestigious as a HoF. Just an opinion.  It should also be created by the governing body (Riot) to preserve the integrity of the Hall. 




 Only word I understood was 'Fuck' 




 If I play mid I always play Fizz if he's open (he's my main). However, I don't know what to build first with the recent Lich Bane changes. Is this still the best item to rush? Another question of mine is, who are the best AP junglers? I'm not good enough to play Elise, Fidd is too situational, and Evelynn is more AD than AP. 




 You're seriously put-off by some champions (a digital character) taunting? Damn dude, would hate to see you get tea-bagged on Halo. You can also keep the pentakill because it's extremely rewarding and badass. I've never seen someone steal a penta then have a teammate ragequit/grief. Why have equal portraits either? This is an extremely soft view you're taking, I'm sorry.

           The only point that I really agree with is the "all chat". Because that is essentially useless in 100% of the cases. There is nothing that you can communicate with the opponent that can help you out. It usually stems from playful joking from 0-1:55, then after that its nothing important from 1:55-end.  




 Heres the tiers in my opinion,    Riot  ESPN  British Football Commentators, those lads are brilliant over there across the pond. 




 RIP headphone users, fuck
 




 Came for the prospect of Iker playing League, left disappointed
 




 I know it's your body and not my decision in the slightest. But come on man, do you really want a LoL champion tattooed, the game probably won't survive 5-10 more years. Commence my down votes. 




 Yeah I'm totally disregarding that comment, athlete sports take a level of intelligence in their own right 




 Seems like the problem lies within riot and not the fans. With the amount of cameras they have, the commentators could announce it remotely in the next room over without missing a beat. I will admit that league does involve a precedent never seen before in sports. This precedent is that live commentary is actually a necessity for the fans. Seems weird to think about goin to a football game and have an analyst over the speaker the entire time. 




 So I'll preface this, like I did in my title, that I'm a long time sports fan before I ever got into e-sports. There is an unusual thing that I'm seeing with the e-sports fans. There seems to be factions forming about how fans should be cheering and other etiquette issues, which is foreign to me. Maybe it's just because I support Philadelphia sports teams that have some of the harshest fans that made me like this. But I say that fans cheering and being loud is all a part of the game and it's the atmosphere that riot should want to generate energy in the building. Now I don't think fans should be able to call out opponents positions or if the other team is baroning. In the real sports world there are unfair conditions, home field advantage, etc that can swing games, but it's a part of the game. Fans do whatever they can, within reason, to help their team win.

TLDR; If you want to accept the popularity of the growing sport and help keep the exciting atmosphere, then accept what real sports atmospheres are really like. 




 I hate cosplay and think it's one of the most awkward things I could ever witness. If I'm ever fortunate to have kids some day, I'd rather walk in on them beating off than have them dressed as a league character and dancing To make a YouTube video. 




 Vel'koz is the Flying Spaghetti Monster, what an awesome skin idea concept! Anyone? 




 CFC CHECLSEA!!! 




 Yet again I can't play Hecarim even once! Rito plox! D: 




 Does that yellow show up on their screen too? 




 Can I just have a quick clarification for Evelynn's stealth? When I'm around my opponent, the eye above them is gold. Does that mean that they know that I'm around, they just don't know where exactly? And when it turns red, it means they can full on see me. I just want to make sure I watch for this as I learn to jungle eve. 




 Yeah this helps, thank you. I know what you mean about the trouble with some mids picking AD assassin champs like a talon or zed. I don't have a very deep jungling champion pool. I keep it to panth, j4, and fidd. I'm still trying to learn eve, but I think Elise might be above my skillcap to use her well.  




 When I'm picking a jungler, is it right for me to want to keep a balance between the AD and AP on my team? So lets just assume that mid is AP, bot is AD with an AP support. If my top picks an AD champ, do i always wanna go with an AP jungler, and vice versa? I realize that it is in a sense situational and it depends on my team comp. I'm just kind of looking for a general rule of thumb for know which junglers to pick, given a team comp. 




 I feel embarrassed that this dude was wearing that in public.
 




 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand another week without Hecarim 




 If it happens in real professional sports, its even more definite to happen for League Of Legends. Since English isn't your first language, this analogy might not be very effective. However, for basketball, Kobe Bryant (Famous  dude) this year was almost voted an All-Star despite being injured for pretty much the entire season and not having any stellar performances. 




 If you check his right ear, ya missed a spot. 




 Riot's own Vitruvian Man 




 What happens when Vel'koz gets The Lantern 




 I feel the exact same way man. It's been well documented that the toxicity of the LoL community is pretty great. I see posts all the time about these issues and it happens to me all the time too. I actually almost considered quitting the game entirely because I was amazed at how selfish most players are. Reminding people to be nice to other people, and remember who is actually behind the computer screen doesn't really work. In theory its great, and practical, but its so easy to be angry. So really the only way to make great environments for playing is for riot to take drastic action, and place all the trolls together. But they've already stated that they won't do that, so don't hold your breath for any changes in the ranked environment any time soon. Essentially the only time I feel like I'm in a relaxed environment is when I'm in normals, and the result of the match doesn't really matter to me. So good luck in trying to get out of bronze and thence forward. :) 




 Ever since I started playing about 7 months ago or so I always saw Hecarim as a badass. However, he hasn't been free since I've started playing and I think 6300IP is too expensive to try him out. Hecarim I want to try you please come out and play! D:  




 Out of the 5 or so best junglers currently in the meta, which have the best level 1-3? And which counter each other so you know whether to invade or not? 




 Why have game modes been playable for a week or so and then removed? Why not give players the options to play a variety of different game modes? Seems interesting that they keep a game mode like dominion, yet neglect game modes that get a lot of traffic. Maybe, there are server issues and it becomes just too hard for Riot to keep all these game modes functioning simultaneously. Does anyone know an actual reason or do they just like to keep things fresh and new? Thanks! 




 Plus his eye is basically an extra pink ward if you look at it. OP 




 Ah, those were all very good points to be made. Especially the time zone one, since I live on the east coast and the time I play before bed, could be the time that someone on the west coast just ate dinner. 




 I was just making an observation and this is in no way a definite truth, but I feel like I win more games during the night time. And this is independent of what day of the week it is. So I began to wonder what the cause might be. Is it that I just am more relaxed and focused to play before I go to sleep? Am I just at an awkward ELO that it's hard for be to be too consistent? Now before I make my main point, I'd like to preface that I'm over 18 years old :P. But could I have a better win percentage because at night I'm more likely to play with other players of my age demographic? Since I wouldn't be playing with younger players, is there a less chance of having ? I realize that this is completely different than the 65-year old trying to text and just being completely confused by a younger generation. But could this age gap with my teammates during the day be causing me to lose more? I also want to point out that I'm not trying to condescend to younger players that are better than me ha. However, is there a point to made? Please let me know if you find this interesting or if I'm just seeing things that aren't there. Thank you. 
























 Cherylee by Gowns on spotify, second half of the song is powerful 




 John Frusciante's solo in Wet Sand by Red Hot Chili Peppers or the face melting solo in Alive by Mike McCready of Pearl Jam 




 What's your favorite short song? I'm gonna set the limit as anything 3:00 or shorter, I think that's reasonable enough to be considered short. So what're your favorites? I think the top on many people's list might be Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin, but I think my favorite is Songbird by Oasis, great summer tune. 




 As soon as saw this as a topic I knew it'd be about these lines of the song. If I were green I would die just fits the melody. It's the same thing as misheard lyrics to me. In Pearl Jam's song Yellow Ledbetter, Eddie says, "but they don't wave" but it legitimately sounds like "potato wave". We all know it's not potato wave but it sure as hell sounds like it. 




 I'm in love with their ability to tell a story that can draw emotional responses from the listener 




 That Western Skyline or A Little Bit of Everything by Dawes 




 John Frusciante's cover of How Deep Is Your love, originally by the Bee Gees

http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=awKM1YLAl18

This is so awesome, John is so talented, love this guy. 




 Wow, yes it is still on netflix, I checked, looks super intriguing, thanks. 




 RHCP is in my current top 5 bands, I love those dudes, I dont care if reddit thinks they've fallen off either 




 Helllll yes, I love early hip hop, this is gonna be awesome 




 If this isn't a documentary about Kevin Federline as a backup dancer than I don't wanna watch it. Nah, I'm kidding, thanks for the netflix link. 




 hmm I'm not familiar with any of these, that can only be good news 




 Hmm first 3-4 albums you say? I'll give it a whirl 




 Definitely looking forward to seeing the Talking Heads, I don't know much about them really, pretty obscure fellows I imagine 




 Hopefully this will help me understand the punk scene more! Thanks for the suggestion 




 AWESOME, I'm a fan of all these dudes, can't wait, thanks 




 They recently came to Hershey, PA. Near where I'm from, and I think some people said they put on a pretty good show. I'm not a fan of theirs myself, but I can appreciate good showmanship 




 I love watching documentaries, and I love music and I've watched a few rock docs. Can anyone suggest any good rock docs that discuss music from any time frame between the 50's and now? I like when they are specifically talking about genres or artists, but I wouldn't mind a documentary discussing multiple genres at once and how their fan bases felt towards each other, and how it effected the genre in all. 




 Ayyyyy a Marina fan, I see you kid  




 Spotify has allowed me to broaden my horizons so immensely, I'm very thankful for it 




 Gnarly amigo, that's what I like to hear 




 This song is so gnarly, too bad only one album was ever made. 




 Ahhh!!!!!!! I totally had a similar situation with Black! It was always one of my favorites, but after a certain situation it actually made tears swell in my ears and I had trouble listening to those exact lyrics.

Sage Francis from his new album. "May the bridges that we burn light the way"

And lastly Johnny Cash's cover of Hurt in combination with his music video is heavy shit. "You can have it all, this empire of dirt" as his hand is trembling and pour out a drink onto the ground. 




 I was in England at the time she died, and there was a bunch of hooplah, but I frankly didn't care a whole lot. I don't know why I'm not a fan, it could be because she dated a bum and she shoplifted tabloid magazines, but I guess that shouldn't affect my opinion of her as a musician, but oh well, it does. 




 Hmm, its easy to see the benefits. I would envision that this would grant the new player base experience in going forward with their gameplay.  




 Ahh it was a low budget (relatively speaking) indie film that received all great reviews as far as I know. I think the movie is awesome. Anyways... I always, for some reason thought the song "Satellite" always seemed like a narrative for the movie District 9. I dont know... something about this combination always made me think they clicked together.  




 Thats actually the song I had in mind when you mentioned Rise Against, debatably my top 3 song of theirs. Ok Sephiroth, I have a question, have you ever seen District 9? 




 I've always admired Rise Against's lyricism, good lyric choice 




 I really liked Copper Gone by Sage Francis and Southsiders by Atmosphere 




 That was awesome 




 Ahh gotcha, thanks man, I was trying to get a general gist of what people thought, and this makes sense to me. 




 Hey guys, I was just wondering  what all of your guys' favorite Frusciante songs. I dig Central, Murderers, The Mirror, Before the Beginning, Time Goes Back, and The Past Recedes. Those are my top 5 probably in no particular order.  




 Mariah Carey

Cherylee by Gowns
 




 Ahh, so I guess that's why it's never brought up :P Thanks for the heads up man. I also totally dig the album, and Greenwood rips the tits off his guitar. I guess now I'll just sit and wait for my ass kicking. 




 Hey all, I've been browsing the music subreddit for only about a week or so and I've seen a bunch of Radiohead fans (not really a surpirse), however, most of the discussion I've seen has been about OK Computer or Kid A, deservedly so. I was just curious as to what the community thought about Pablo Honey, being there first album and all. Creep doesn't need to be mentioned, but you all probably already knew that. 

One of my favorite tracks is definitely "You". Yorke's voice just incredibly shreds through the song and gives me awesome chills and I'm left amazed. I just thought I'd make this quick point.

Anyways, I was just wondering what the general feeling of this album was, cheers. 




 Michael Jackson, why do you call Sprite "Jesus juice?" 




 Keith Moon - Wanna grab a beer since we have the same birthday? And maybe we can talk about your Holiday Inn story 




 The first time I heard contact I was actually blown away by the build up, I thought it was Sooo good, but you're right it almost feels like the the rest of the song is anticlimactic. 




 Hmm and I only like the first half of Touch... Maybe RAM wasn't the best choice on second thought 




 Hey not a bad remix to it, you definitely did enough adjusting to "make it your own" so to speak. 




 I've only listened through it once so far, and it seemed like if you like Rise Against, you'll probably like this album. It didn't seem to stray too far from the norm, which is fine. I was just wondering what the community on here thought about it. Thanks. 




 Motherboard on Random Access Memories didn't do much for me 




 I agree, I think I get the message that Radiohead was trying to convey, but I wouldn't say it ruined the album. I definitely could have done without it though. 




 Open Happiness by a collective of artists 




 you're awesome 




 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aYiiGd3PZc t=2m2s


 









 It can sometimes be hard to pull off a tribute song that is really as cohesive as this one. Slug did an awesome job. R.eye.P 









 The intro of "Stranglehold" by Ted Nugent. As soon as you hear that you know I'm in the zone and about to show you a girthy yet humble 6.4 inch dong slice 




 I stopped filling it out once I saw Mac miller with more votes than slug 




 O.A.R. Are one of my summer bands 




 As if I needed another reason to love Eddie. 




 Yep I'm not sure if it's still on there, but yeah we started watching it as a joke, then we decided to stop ha 




 Lost me at Avril lavigne, and made me want to kill myself at Bieber. 

EDIT: just saw Bruno Mars (I'm dead) 




 Skalett Johansson 




 FIZZZ LESS'GO 




 The only thing I could think to hide is when my roommate and I watched the first 10 minutes "Nude Nuns with Big Guns". I could not wait to get that off my previously watched list. 




 Fancy - Iggy Azalea 




 Ahh sorry to hear that man, truly I am. It's also good that you have BB to turn to that can bring back good memories. 




 Bringing back the memories of listening to Breaking Ben. First heard of them playing Halo 2 and their song "Blow Me Away" was in the campaign.  




 Thanks fellas, I'm going to check these out ASAP 




 Piano Man by Billy Joel, American Pie by Don McLean, Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, and Under the Bridge by Red Hot Chili Peppers 




 I re-watched School of Rock the other day, and it has always been one of my favorite movies from when I was growing up (come at me). I think I first watched it when I was in middle school. I can still remember that scene where "Bonzo Goes to Bitburg" by the Ramones is playing and Jack Black is basically teaching his students everything about the History of Rock, and what a huge impact this scene had on me the first time I watched it. This was the first moment I can remember really getting into music, and it was because of this scene. With Freddy watching live performances of the The Who's Keith Moon, and Jack Black filling the blackboard with hundreds of bands and connecting their genres and influences. It was just incredible to me. So after re-watching it, I wanted to know some of the best live/historic performances ever to watch. I want to see how the legends played and the iconic moments they had. THANKS :) 




 Teams should always be bigger than the players in any sport. There are usually BIG problems that arise when players think they are bigger than the team. 




 Well so much for being coy. I reciprocate the feelings, what can I say. 




 Put your ear down to the earth and listen for it. Put your heart into it, and ye shall find what your heart desires! 




 you're right, as much as it pains me, gotta take it down. 




 Stop thinking of it as a losing streak. Each game is independent of one another. So try to just put past losses behind you and focus on the next game, to avoid going on tilt

 




 No one pays them. It's a video game. 




 Anyone else think that it would be nicer if they played the replays a bit slower so the pros have enough time to speak about the fight. A lot of time the fights are too fast paced and some of the strategy and analysis is left out. Especially in crucial fights when there are so any moving parts, it'd be nice to absorb as much info as possible. 




 Somebody is on Fantasy tilt 




 Looking at the champs compared to the actor. Christian Bale seems the most believable. 




 Ahh okay, I would think of a champ with no cc. Multiple abilities that can cc usually help define a support champ as well as their ability to shield or heal you. Master yi offers no cc and will steal your cs without protecting you. An adc also come to mind that doesn't really support but helps kill, is Lucian. Zed also doesn't seem to offer too much into the role. And I'm not sure about Vlad or not. 




 You mean the most viable, nonpopular pick? Or do you literally want the worst champion that could ever try and support? 




 I think it's the fact that no team is really head and shoulder above the other teams. So confidence in ending games is an issue. It took TSM so long to close out that game. 




 Xpecial and Cop on the analysts desk, stick knives in my ears plsssss 




 Cosplay still sucks. 




 Who's this guy at the announcer's desk???? WTF 




 Why did he make out with Meachum? Can anyone explain that scene? 




 Actually really helpful and concise. I've been wanting to learn Elise as well, but was kind of discouraged by her two forms. I don't like champs with 2 forms because I have a tough time judging each forms power. Thanks. 




 So basically this post is about how EU LCS makes me really hard, but ends up being anti-climactic. Reflects my last 3 days fairly accurately. 




 Not sure if a parody or not. 0(o.o)0 




 If reddit didn't have a "remember me" system when logging into the site, you'd be screwed. 




 really? :( first time I've seen it. It's original to me. Uh-oh philosophical debate incoming.  




 CLASSIC MIX-UP 




 I'm confused. Explain pls. 




 Hmmmm Interesting. 

Pros: Rewards team for defending wards ( as you stated)  

Cons:Would make the pink slightly stronger (not sure if a noticeable difference) [Not sure if this is even a con]

Hmm. It's actually a pretty fresh and original idea. Good Work. Wouldn't mind seeing it implemented. Not sure if it will, but I like it nonetheless. 




 Dodging is the last good defense against trolls, I say lower the LP penalty, even though i'll never reach that division. I approve of the ideology behind it. 




 Can you make a tutorial video pls? I think the community would be grateful. 12/10 on improvements, would buy it from a 3am infomercial on comedy central 
























 This would be a stupid move on Wilmots case in my opinion. I think Wilmot mismanaged this Belgian squad in Brazil. Though Belgium got as far as some expected after the draw was revealed. I can't help think that he didn't do enough to get Hazard motivated or involve him enough. Hazard at the beginning was tipped to be one of the stars of the WC, but turned out to be a shadow of his usual self. 









 This quote seems kind of odd. I feel like he didn't need to apologize because he wasn't owned by us. If anyone should be close to apologizing, it's Courtois, but even so, I don't want him apologizing either.  Costa didn't have a %100 guarantee of being sold to Chelsea so he shouldn't be sorry for putting on a good *audition*, he should probably apologize to terry for irritating him haha. 




 Ha ok then I don't know. 




 
Hmm, it was working initially... I even checked since I posted it from mobile to see if the URL was different. But now I'm actually having trouble accessing it too. Might be a disruption on their end. 









 Why did Argentina bring Palacios to Brazil with them instead of this man? 




 Separate ways by journey?? 




 Yeah I remember his album with josh where is was basically all guitar instrumentals. And that's an awesome fact about curtains ha 




 Yes indeed, John is a beautiful human being. Now I don't have any knowledge of this, I haven't read any articles or anything. But in his solo albums does he make all the sounds? Not necessarily play all the instruments but maybe does he use computer programs and such? Or does he bring people in to sort of collaborate. 




 I know, he's one of the guitarists that I associate with their guitar. In a sense when I hear him play, it feels like it's speaking for him. He's a pretty eccentric dude so I can only assume that he's been trying to really experiment, and maybe it's selfish for me to tell him what to make, but oh well. 




 Why is this a thread? Seems like Marketing 101 for the 1960's. 




 My other favorites from the album are The Mirror and The Will To Death, gotta love John, however, I couldn't really get into his newest album 




 Zzyzx rd - stone sour, absolutely a great tune 




 Damn, that was good. So now you got me wondering why this doesn't get equal praise. Probably the simple answer, Rise Against being the most recent to do it. Also with the lessening popularity of our involvement in the Middle East, with the video playing a very key role in my experience with the song. 




 i'll have to give it a listen. 




 From my experience, I haven't heard a song that talks about the warrior after the war. And the regret the warriors have when every gratifies them for their "heroism". If there is another song that does this, then so be it. But I haven't heard it 




 This is actually really awesome, is there somewhere he'll be posting the songs or has it already been done by him elsewhere?  




 It seems like English papers get away with posting bullocks 




 Sergio Busquets 




 Even though I feel like the East is getting stronger, it's still not the west... so we have a chance to at least maybe surprise some people 




 Damn, sixers drafted Elfrid before they traded him, woulda been oodles of fun 




 Oh god, that handshake at the end was cringe-worthy. Handshakes bring out the whiteness in all white people. 

Jokes aside.. Lookin forward to Joel's impact in the future 




 I want the Sixers to be above .500 with Nerlens having a good year after recovering from injury his entire rookie season. BECAUSE HAIR. 




 Last Kiss - Pearl Jam 




 Camera Thief - Atmosphere

Make Em Purr - Sage Francis
 




 I've always admired Rise Against for their lyricism, but damn did this song step it up for me. 




 DK in Donkey Kong 64 




 Hey reddit, I see this album mentioned a lot and how it has had a major influence on the history of music. I was wondering if anyone knew any articles that discussed this albums influences or basically anything that would teach me more about this album. I like music history a lot, but this isn't something I've looked into deeply, any comments would be great. 




 I'm just messin around, it's actually a good point 




 Fuck Iggy with a Ron Jeremy dick 




 Wax is back and crack is whack kids  




 EDIT: duh 




 Doesn't lead to a fulfilling climax? Then you've obviously never shouted "oh mama Mia mama Mia" as loud as you can, very fulfilling 




 Innuendo by Queen has some awesome acoustic guitar soloing, definitely worth the listen if you haven't already. 




 I blame Rosie O'Donnell 




 And sisters! You eugenist 




 Wish you were here - pink floyd 




 Nah, I wasn't talking about your whore mother specifically, just in general. The thesis was about the whore in everybody's mom. 




 His name is Simon Carmichael, got his PhD at the age of 16 from Oxford in Computer Science, and his doctoral thesis was on "The correlation between Broadband speed and your moms level of whoreness." Great guy. 




 Black by Pearl Jam 




 I see that album mentioned a lot, could you point to a good article or anything that would help me understand its influence a bunch more? 




 Higher Ground by RHCP is also pretty dope 




 The Scientist - Coldplay

Imagine - John Lennon 




 Ha, I remember their Pants song. I used to think that song was the funniest shit since Ace Ventura. Oh to be 7 again. 




 yeah i get it, god isn't real. 




 That's kinda the joke I'm going for. We all live our lives assuming God doesn't exist. So if we get to the Pearly Gates, we're all gonna say... "shit" because obviously we won't be getting in. Don't think too hard 




 Yep no problemo man, enjoy 









 Good album since nothing for the past like past 3 or 4 years. Sage is a lyrical creative monster as usual, shows a lot of emotion with isolation and heartbreak and such. My favorite tracks are Grace, Make em Purr, ID Thieves, and Vonnegut Busy. But essentially, if you dig Sage, you're gonna dig this album.

Ahh thanks for the clarification, I just always group Sage with those guys. 




 Rhymesayers label produces so much quality. Been bumpin Copper Gone and Southsiders since they came out earlier this year.  




 Lupe is pretty outspoken about his hatred for violence, one of the most well known, and that's what I respect about LUpe 




 And then my roommate looked at me and said, "dude that was totally tubular" 




 You probably think this song is about you don't you, don't you? 




 you mean you don't like that T.I. is gonna "split your ass in two?" :p 




 Link? 




 I remember the first time I heard this. It was a live performance on one of the late night shows. And I was like, "Holy Shit, what was that? That was great" 




 Have you ever listened to a song and it seems to really gel with you, except there are lyrics that just don't click? This is how I feel sometimes, and it can be off-putting. However, these songs I'm about to mention, I still listen to and love.

The two that come to mind off the top of my head are "Champagne Supernova" by Oasis and "Human" by The Killers


I know Champagne Supernova is the most famous one, but can't go without being said.


* Champagne Supernova "Slowly walking through the hall, faster than a cannonball..."

EGAD! Does not compute  [The moment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3C7DECI0jU t=0m43s)


* Human "Are we Human? Or are we Dancer? My sign is vital. My hands are cold"

I don't get it, does anyone? [We are Dancer, I guess](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIZdjT1472Y t=0m43s)


This isn't a thread about the worst lyrics, I'd like it to be the lyrics you'd like to change to otherwise good songs.


Conspiracy theory: Both songs occur at the 43 second mark... dun dun dun

Thanks! 




 Lover of the Light and Dust Bowl Dance by Mumford and Sons. And War Song by O.A.R. 









 I love RHCP, and even though a lot of redditors really dig BSSM, I think Stadium Arcadium is my favorite Frusciante workings for RHCP

I'm not a big Beatles guy so I won't witch hunt you about Lennon, even though Imagine changed my life (post-Beatles I know). And as for Thom Yorke, I really like about half of Radiohead's discography, and the other half I just like. And from the interviews and musical talks it seems like Thom gets a lot of the shine, but you'd be better off asking someone else. 




 *Marcus Mumford 




 Brian May, the only famous musician I know to have a PhD in astrophysics. Stud in my book.
 




 Townsend/Moon destroying instruments frequently, Townsend hitting Sinclair at Woodstock in '69? Sure Roger was the frontman, but I think it's unfair to say he overshadowed those fellows. 




 'Giorgio by Moroder' by Daft Punk on the Random Access Memories is a really cool and unique track that has Giorgio talking for a portion of the song. 




 Ehhhh I don't agree with The Who, Pete Townsend and Keith Moon also managed to make sure they weren't out of the spotlight. 




 Yeah Pete Townsend took them to a whole new level. As for another contributor, I think Neil Peart, the drummer from Rush is up there. He is a really smart dude that also writes the lyrics, lots of good lyricism in Rush songs. Not to mention, he's one of the best drummers out there.

I think it's also fair to mention John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Once he joined RHCP, he changed the game for them. Him and Jimi Hendrix are two guitarists that I really think are 'one' with their guitar/sound. So good to listen to. 




 The Who, Keith Moon helped turn drummers from time keepers into bad asses that can express themselves on the drums. Pete Townsends lyricism and brute force when playing influenced punk and expressed anger. Roger Daltrys presence on stage was also awesome. 




 Somebody To Love, Live in Montreal... To any nonbelievers

EDIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpEUXRz08t4 




 It seems like encores have become a pleasantry to the bands from the fans. If the fans don't call for an encore then they might be seen as rude or ungrateful. It's the same thing as saying "bless you" when someone sneezes. It serves no purpose, but if you don't say bless you, then you look like a dick. Unless someone sneezed before, then I might cheer for a sneeze encore, depending on the quality of the sneeze. 




 Words I Never Said by Lupe Fiasco from Laser. Sky Full Of Stars by Coldplay from Ghost Stories. These are pretty mainstream, but what resonated with me the most. These songs in my opinion are a shining light in a lackluster album. Personally, I don't hate Lasers like most hip-hop fans did but I thought Lupe killed that track even if the beat was a bit industrial-esque. As for Ghost Stories, the best track is an Avicii song with Chris Martin as the featured singer. Everything else about the album is mehhhh. Gwenyth Paltrow sucks. 




 I know the leaders of TPB got caught, but as for the site as a whole, is it still safe to use? 




 This album is so chilling, watching any live performance of this album gives me goosebumps. 




 It's not like riot is cutting them royalty checks, it's more or less a pat on the back. 




 Southsiders by Atmosphere, Copper Gone by Sage Francis, and Lazaretto Jack White 




 The Pokemon? 




 I like the idea of riot developing the community's idea, but they should also give credit where credits due. Maybe just a footnote on the bottom of the page that says "Originally designed by:_____". Doesn't have to be anything too flamboyant, and maybe give that user the champ for free and some RP, seems like good enough compensation for their contribution. 




 With the emergence of youtube and talent search shows, A LOT of people have the capability to be really good at singing. The person with the best image then emerges on top 




 I feel like writing your own songs is such a big part of the artistry of music 




 I suppose you're right, maybe I need to take a chill pill on it 




 I'm not saying their not talented because they can sing really really good. I just don't think they should be idolized based on the lyrics they sing. And people quoting their lyrics as mantras for their daily lives seems like a sham. 




 I get the feeling that with modern autotuning equipment, that radio artists are a dime a dozen. Find someone with a pretty face that can sing, and we'll do the rest for ya. I lot more people are able to sing than are able to write songs. 




 I don't know about full score, but Promentory from Last Of The Mohicans is such a slept on song 




 Personally, I really don't like the idea of a band not writing their own material. It's okay in my opinion for some of their material, but people that gain fame without writing their own material isn't really that impressive to me. When someone releases a song under their name, they are effectively advocating whatever they're saying, unless its satire. So it seems like when people admire an artist/band, they're worshiping a facade. How do you guys feel about this? 




 I can't listen to them any more after finding out their lead singer is in prison for 35 years for sexually assaulting an infant. 




 This is actually pretty off base. First off Motrhead and will.i.am aren't representatives of their genre. And there's also a clear difference in time frame and it's correlation with popularity. Motrhead isn't as likely to get recognized on the scale Will is. His popularity is a lot larger so he's getting haggled everywhere he goes. Motrhead is in the twilight of their career and loves the intimacy they can have with their fans at this time in their careers. Also, if you're in Hong Kong having visa issues, how badly would you care about having your photo taken with a stranger. Must've been frustrating, as is. 




 I BELIEVE IN LOVE, THATS ALL WE'VE GOT, LOVE KNOWS NO BOUNDARIES, NO BORDERS TO CROSS! 




 First person shooter? Yeah you're gonna get kids screaming profanities regardless of nationality. 




 And yet Finland has some of the highest test scores amongst the 15-18 year old range. Get more aggressive America. Little ironic.

 




 This is just speculation and I don't have any hard evidence to back it up. But I did see that record sales are down since last year, and I don't know if it's a trend or not. However, with iTunes and such, it's a lot easier to cherry pick the songs you like and not need to buy the others. Could it be easier for the less active fans to quickly sift through a bands *newest* and *best* tunes without having to listen through them all. Basically, is a band better off hyping 3-4 singles for a bunch of sales than an entire album? 




 I'm not afraid to admit that I love power ballads, I'm not even afraid to admit it on reddit where I'm sure they're scorned. That being said, who's brave enough to admit some of their favorite power ballads? 
























 Not only does it set the time for a great album, I just listened to it and I have a final in 5 minutes, and I just realized how powerful of a song this is. That is all, I needed to share this. 




 Time 3:18-4:45, pretty much just sex on my ears, one day I'm gonna find a nice girl and impregnate her to this solo. 




 Right down the pisser! 




 So basically what I got out of this was that I'm going to become a Taylor Swift fan. Just kidding man, sweet pics of that airship and even sweeter beard brother. 




 Meh 




 I regret the fact that I have to say tDSotM is a perfect album, besides this one song I always skip :( 




 Upvote for O.A.R. I saw them a few years back in Hershey. Great live performers, the saxophonist is great. 




 Didn't see that one coming /s
 




 The Division Bell by Pink Floyd


Don't know how many times I've immersed myself in this album whilst studying. 




 Hmm that's still interesting. Thanks for the link, I do wish they would announce a number, seems weird that they didn't. 




 Halo 1 might be difficult to discern, but I was talking with my roommates today about what Halo had the most simultaneous players. The only thing I really found out was that Halo 3 had 1.1M players in the first 24 hours which is incredible. Can anyone point me in the right direction or know the totals for each? Thanks 




 *cough* wow *cough*

[2 days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/pinkfloyd/comments/2nb5xp/hypothetical_discussion_what_if_roger_waters_solo/) 




 DISCLAIMER: The thoughts in this post are just my opinion and should be taken as such, so please just keep that in mind.


So I listened to The Final Cut then Amused To Death right after that, and it got me thinking. What if Waters came to the band with AtD instead of TFC? I personally really like most of TFC, but there are moments I don't care for. I also don't dislike it in the way some PF fans do. I also personally think AtD is Waters' best solo album and really enjoy it, however, I feel like it's missing a small PF feel to it. 


To many fans, I think, they'd consider DSotM through The Wall as the golden era of PF. Would AtD been a continuation of this era? Did Roger have such a chokehold on the band at this point that anything would've split them up? Would it be a great success and considered a classic? Would things have played out differently? 




 One of the better songs off TFC in my opinion. Especially, "SHOULD WE SHOOOOOOOOOOUT?! SHOULD WE SCREEEEEEEEAM?! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE POST-WAR DREEEEEEEEAM?!" 




 Sam's Town is such a fucking great album 




 Dear McLordy, 4 incorrect uses of "they're" 




 Are there any sites that catalog pretty much every song by PF? Besides Wikipedia which I'm sure credits each song with the appropriate singer. I like this list you did, but obviously it's not the entire catalog as I find myself confused at times. 




 Dear lord, what a shame... I never heard of him, so excuse my academy ignorance, but it's a tragic time when any blue falls, 1st teamer, academy player, fan, or not. Rest easy bud. 




 As a student at WVU, this song is of great importance to me. To the place, I belooooooong, West Virginia  




 That's fair. I've been there.  




 "Gilmore".... cringing 




 I think out of all the carvings, this is the best one I've seen yet. Very well done. 




 More specifically: His favorite song by the band in general, and his favorite song to play on drums 




 As awful as the NCAA is, I hope they do the right thing and punish UNC accordingly. And this time when handing out punishments, make sure that they are punishing the correct people... not student athletes that weren't involved in the scandal. This is a total breakdown of the university at the highest level and it'll be hard for the NCAA to punish appropriately. But I have no fear that they will royally fuck it up. 




 I want some more of it. 




 Should have made Any Colour You Like longer and got rid of On The Run 




 This is my absolute favorite song to jam to in the car. Especially driving around town and having it blast for other people. I feel like I'm putting strangers in a great mood 




 Surprised no one said The Wall by Pink Floyd. Even came with a movie and it's super bad ass! 




 At the very end of the song is an amazing guitar solo, as we are all aware of. But I always wonder what could've been because as the song fades out, you can hear David Gilmour still just melting faces with that guitar. The solo is perfection, but damn do I always wish I could here more of that solo because by that point of the song I'm in such a trance-like state that I want more.  




 Twenty One Pilots and Pink Floyd. You can never have too much Pink Floyd though 




 Holy shit, you are awesome 




 Special shoutout to you too man. Hope to see you around here from time to time too. 




 I'm glad you've been given the reins. I don't post here much, but I check it daily and read your posts many times and it couldn't have been passed to a better dude. Anyways that being said. This song was kinda disappointing because Nobody Home to Comfortably Numb is my favorite part of the entire album. I actually find myself done listening to the album after Comfortably Numb, just because it gets a bit too abstract for me. That's all 




 Holy hell that was confusing haha, I'm not sure what I was voting for tbh 




 I thought Endless River wasn't going to include any new tracks? Just some archived material from back in the day. If so, there wouldn't be any new tricks unfortunately
 









 Thanks  man, glad you liked it. Yeah with those albums, only the most dedicated RHCP fans are listening  so that has an effect on it. I'm not sure what effect exactly ha 




 Thanks for the politeness man. I was a bit surprised about If you want me to stay, but Higher Ground seemed like the obvious favorite imo. 




 Hey all, I did a similar thing before with other bands where I looked at each album by an artist and took note of which song had the most plays.  I don't include live or greatest hits albums. Enjoy!

Format: **Album** song, plays

* **Red Hot Chili Peppers** True Men Don't Kill Coyotes, 275,575
* **Freaky Styley** If You Want Me To Stay, 190,731

* **I'm With You** The Adventures Of Rain Dance Maggie, 6,746,450


Not that many surpises to be honest, but interesting nonetheless. 




 Is nobody gonna notice the shitty goalkeeping? 




 Hey all, I did a similar thing before where I looked at each album by an artist and took note of which song had the most plays. I'm going to do this with RHCP since they have a large discography/fanbase. I don't include live or greatest hits albums. Enjoy!

 about 60,000, which is less than 1% difference 




 There was actually like a 2 million play difference too, really surprised me. The closest was between like Comfortably Numb and Brick in the wall pt. 2 




 Drink some platinums and play this jam. 




 "I'll have what she's having" - Peter Griffin 




 I was just curious to see which Pink Floyd songs are the most listened to played by on Spotify. So I compiled this list real quick. I didn't include live versions or greatest hits albums.

I would try to see if I could guess the most popular song off each album before I checked. Was surprised by a few, and others were sometimes obvious. Interesting stuff, hope you guys enjoy. 




 Well, I didn't intend on coming into r/pics to shit myself 




 Am I the only one when in the air, imagine that I'm looking at an ocean with the clouds being icebergs? Or nah? 




 I think the shoes are awesome and incredibly well done. I won't buy em because its just not my style of shoe. Thats not in any way an insult to you. Just not my thing. Only lower the price if the market demands for it to be lowered. 




 I didn't like Final Cut at first because I thought it was too polarizing. But the more I listen to it, the better it gets because I listen to it from Roger's point of view.

 Wet Sand by Red Hot Chili Peppers. This songs guitar solo was playing as I turned 21 and it's still my favorite shit ever 




 If he's fit, that's more than great. But with remy, my anxiety that has lingered for the past couple of years could be relieved. Not to hail remy too early before he's done anything. But there's no denying a complete mentality shift with regards to our strike force this season. They have awesome confidence that we've needed badly. 




 Big Brother is always watching 




 This was posted about a month or so ago and went straight to the top... I see you guy. 




 Rhymesayers 




 Badass intro I love it 




 Ahhh good suggestions. Too much hip-hop gets slept on in here. 




 So /u/LackOfForesight (gotta give him credit) did a thing where he asked /r/music for 52 albums to listen to over a year in an attempt to expand his musical palette. I suggested on his thread, that we listen to the albums as a community and discuss them on a weekly basis. It didn't get really popular but it seemed that there was still a contingent in the community that would like to do this.

* So I was wondering if that's something the community would actually be interested in doing. If this gains enough traction I will definitely be happy to facilitate the postings.

* There's a couple things that need to be cleared up first. Would you guys want use the list of 52 albums that he already compiled, or create a brand new list of "52 must listen to albums"

If you want to suggest a new album please put it in a format like this:

* Artist
* Album
* Genre

You can suggest as many as albums as you'd like, I'll keep track of it all, but keep it reasonable to albums that you think everyone should hear. This doesn't need to be an obscure list either. Suggesting famous albums is perfectly valid too.

I hope to get a decent enough response from you guys, Thanks!

EDIT: Good start, it looks like we'll be making a new list. So this needs to preferably hit the front of music's page to make sure we get enough suggestions. 




 I NEED THIS 




 Perfect, thanks man. 




 There has been a lot of variety and changes within the game since the start of the spring split. Champs have come and gone.I was wondering if there was any documentation of all the champs that have been used in this Summer split or Spring Split or both splits combined. And if that list was further broken down by region. It could be like an infographic that shows which region uses the most variety of champions. I'm sure this exists somewhere, so if someone wouldn't mind pointing me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it. Thanks! 




 Let me guess, you read the thread title but not the thread? 




 Dude... We should just make this a community thing. Where everyone listens to the same album and discusses it. :) 




 It's because he's just matured so much since his past recordings, I think. He's an older more thoughtful dude, I expect this to be his new sound 




 Camera Thief is definitely my favorite song from this album, but this song is still pretty good 




 I think this is a phenomenal signing, hell I would've taken him as a number 1 striker if we didn't ever get Costa. 




 The perfect sunday morning tune 




 Wish you were here -- pink floyd 




 The music video for hero of war is so appropriately good
 




 I remember AIM ;) 




 This sub-reddit has a thing called their music hall of fame. It's not a list of the greatest bands ever. It focuses more on the bands that have the most links posted of their songs. So to reduce the amount of songs that get posted over and over by the popular bands, reddit made a hall of fame for these bands. Where, basically posting threads of their song links isn't allowed. All bands in the hall of fame have their own sub reddits. You can find this hall of fame on the front page of this sub reddit, on the right side. 




 I'm goin to see them Sept 6th in Pitt, I'm so excited 




 As a Chelsea fan, this parallel hurts my heart 




 Twenty One Pilots live at Newport Music Hall 




 You just can't post music links of RHCP songs as new threads, if that's what you're referring to 









 This Torres story better not end up in /r/yesyesyesno 




 Dear lord, this has become one of my favorite Sage Francis songs. So personal... So human 




 Hey everyone I appreciate the honest feedback! I will definitely be listening to the suggestions. Thanks again. 




 I've always been into rock from the 60's-80's era, even though I wasn't alive in those eras. But it wasn't until this past summer where I really started to listening to a bunch of Pink Floyd material and I have been bumping a few of their albums (Wish You Were Here, Dark Side of the Moon, and The Wall) a lot. I first listened to WYWH because I always loved the song even though I never heard the album. So I listened to the album and then from there on I kept listening to more and more. I have also listened to The Final Cut, Meddle, Division Bell, and Animals. I know thats not all of their material, but I was just curious as to what other bands have a similar sound or were heavily influenced by Pink Floyd. I think PF's sound is amazing, I love the amazing guitar-work, the lyricism, the ambiance about the tunes too. 

**TL;DR I recently have been listening to more and more Pink Floyd. Now I'm curious as to what other bands sound like them, or were heavily influenced by them. It can be from any era.**

Thanks! 




 The Q is backwards! Veigar doesn't play by the rules of mainstream alphabetical conventions. 




 I like the extended metaphor you used with comparing to reddit, interesting and valid observation. I'm more alarmed, not surprised, but definitely alarmed that the masses like this song by this artist that has 1 song on spotify. Not that spotify is the god of determining musical catalogues, but they usually have a great selection. So I'm just assuming that she is just a pretty face with a voice and will have Disney write her songs. 




 So yesterday was my 21st birthday, and 2 nights ago (night of Aug. 22 going into the 23rd) I was having a birthday party and had the gnarliest moment ever. I then thought it would be awesome at 11:55 to queue up Wet Sand by Red Hot Chili Peppers so at midnight as I turned 21, John Frusciante's guitar solo was absolutely kicking my ass and it was amazing. Beautiful, gnarly, awesome, it was just the way it had to be done.[Wet Sand, solo around 4:22ish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWNDW5KtiKk)

Much love everyone, have a good day 




 O.A.R. -- Crazy Game Of Poker
 




 I've been thinking about the recent players who have left our club like Mata, de Bruyne, Lukaku and Luiz, etc. But one thing I've noticed, that when players leave the club, there doesn't seem to be any bitterness to the player from the fans. Hell, Juan was a club favorite and got pushed out by Mou, but he went to Man U of all clubs and Chelsea fans still love him (including me) and Luiz didn't really have a place in Mou's squad, but he was a fan favorite. I think there's a lot that can be said about Chelsea's fanbase as well as the quality of human beings that we bring in. Players with high character and commitment to the club. Arsenal burns players jerseys when they leave, which have been all their best ones, tbh.

**TL;DR Chelsea fans are great and don't hate players after they leave like Arsenal fans do**
