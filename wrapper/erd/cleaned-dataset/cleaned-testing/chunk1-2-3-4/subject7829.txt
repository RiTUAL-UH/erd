 I don't see why approaching mental states as legitimate subjects of inquiry should entail that they are irreducible. 

I would distinguish between mental and inner states. A "mental state" could just be a stage of a process, like a machine state. An "inner state" to me presupposes some sort of qualitative barrier between process and perception.

My whole point in this discussion is basically I don't know how qualia could ever be considered "states" in the "machine state" or "process state" mould, therefore we can't talk about qualia without presupposing a different kind of "state" that is not a stage of a process.

In other words, I am arguing that reductionism rules out qualia and consciousness as legitimate concepts. That doesn't mean I consider reductionism *wrong* (I am up in the air about that), merely that I think those are the inevitable consequences of accepting it.

we already know a lot more than we did 20 years ago about how the brain handles vision, conscious awareness, religious experiences...

I'd agree with the first and last of those, but not the middle one. Explaining the neural correlates of consciousness is not explaining consciousness, unless doing so can "explain away" consciousness as a meaningful idea, a la Dennet's attempt.

I think that consciousness, as well as qualia, must either be null or radically other. I don't see the middle ground like you seem to.

The idea that maybe they [animals] are just automata that happen to behave in a certain way while experiencing nothing is a remote skeptical possibility akin to "what if we're really brains in a vat?" or "what if other humans are really unconscious zombies?"

It's not remote since many believe that we humans are such automata as well. We can at least say that humans have the *concept* of qualia, even if it turns out not to refer to anything. We can't communicate this concept to animals so we have no way of telling what qualitative experience they may or may not have.

On the ethical side, though, I agree with you: In the absence of strong evidence otherwise it is ethical to assume that humans and animals both experience qualia.

Since our qualia seem to be in continual flux, that suggests to me that it must be a process (or more likely, a set of processes).

I think you're confusing change in stimuli with mental processes. They're two different things. I'm saying - how does qualia fluctuate *if the stimuli remains the same*? A point stimuli or a constant stimuli can kick off a whole cascade of processes but it only seems to generate one immediate, constant quale. Red only becomes "less red" when the rods in my eyes saturate (a physical process). The fact that the quale goes away when I look at something else is not the issue.

then some subset of those feedback connections would be projecting into the visual cortex and incorporating that information into the stream of consciousness. 

The problem is, it doesn't appear as a "stream" or a "process," but as a pointlike experience. Obviously a process assembles that experience before it is "presented" to the awareness, but what is it that can apprehend the entire process instantaneously?

Again, it's not enough to say "well, it really doesn't happen instantaneously, we've proven in the lab that there's a lag of 40 milliseconds" or whatever. Why does it *appear* instantaneous? Where does this sense come from? 

Why a major problem [with Blindsight]? To me it just suggests that it's possible to have a visual experience (however degraded) that one is not consciously aware of. 

Because it argues against the *role* consciousness has been assigned in current reductionist theories, which is as *the name we give to the processing of stimuli via mental states.* Here is a complex mental state in response to a stimuli, with *no conscious component*. That's a huge problem in my book.

Reductionists could fall back on the older view of consciousness as a pure epiphenomenon, an "impotent narrator," but that view has been out of fashion for some time and for good reason.

maybe there is crosstalk in the circuits which, while relatively data-poor, allows patients to perform slightly above chance (which is all they find in performance tests).

[This article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7794783.stm) seems to suggest something a good deal more shocking than "performing slightly above chance." Key quote:

"A video recording shows him completing the obstacle course set up by the scientists "flawlessly", without the aid of his cane or another person."

Also he can respond to facial expressions which is one of the most complex tasks of the brain and I doubt it can be explained by weak cross-talk.

You might be interested in the work of Colin McGinn on this subject.

I can only wonder if these pessimists have ever actually opened a neuroscience textbook, because the way they talk, you'd expect neuroscience books to be 2 pages long!

A lot of them are Philosophers of the Mind, so I *hope* they have read neuroscience, though you never know. Anyway the pessimists aren't so much saying "we can never figure out the brain" in the heuristic sense of figuring out what region processes what, as they are saying that the "deep truths" we want to find by studying the brain, such as "is reductionism true?" simply aren't accessible, and perhaps aren't even intelligible concepts.

Note this is different from saying "consciousness isn't an intelligible concept," it is a level of abstraction removed. The pessimists are saying "asking whether or not consciousness is an intelligible concept is not an answerable question."

Going back to McGinn again he is also sympathetic to this idea though I think at heart he's a non-reductionist though he doesn't declare openly for that.

I'm not one of these pessimists myself but the way that very smart people (a lot more educated than I am) continually seem to talk past and misunderstand each other on this subject makes me queasy that they may be right.

 Thanks. Oh, and I forgot to add:

4.) The hope that close attention to the details will allow for a better foundation upon which attacks on the "big problems" can resume in the future. This view holds that the previous attacks failed because of shaky foundations. Bad definitions, muddled logic, etc. 




 I have no idea what you're talking about but there's a number of works on the intersection between mathematics and philosophy.

One category is the philosophical basis of mathematics (Godel's theorem, Cantor, etc.)

But I think what you're interested in is the converse: A possible mathematical basis for philosophy. On that topic Badiou has been recently popular. 




 1.) over-specialization, a desire to "professionalize" philosophy so that it resembles other university disciplines.

2.) lack of progress on the "hard" questions leading to frustration, giving up, lack of funding.

3.) the view that there are no "hard" questions, just illusions of language. 




 The tendency to over-define vague terms and then follow those definitions to their logical conclusions gets philosophers into muddles.

True, and that might be the problem with qualia. 

I fear we're constructing a pantheon of very slippery inner states, and then postulating new mental states to cover up for the holes in our initial description. In this practice, we quickly reach a point where our main limiting factor is our imagination.

That's my fear also.

My worry is not that there aren't any such inner states to describe, but that our description is theory-rich and data-poor, and therefore we may be misdescribing them rather badly.

I hope so, and I hope more data might shed some light on these questions. However, as of now I can't see a way out of the trap. Accepting "inner states" to any degree seems to entail accepting the whole ridiculous pantheon of irreducible and incommensurable qualia. Rejecting "inner states" means discounting phenomenological observation altogether, which seems almost as ridiculous.

Can't we be pretty sure that animals experience pain? They behave like they're in pain, they have neural wiring similar to that which processes pain in humans, similar stimuli seem to cause pain in animals. 

I'm not as confident. We don't know where in the brain qualia are produced, if they even exist (and if they are even produced by the brain, if they exist.) They may be produced only in the prefrontal cortex, which animals don't possess to the same degree. Animals may simply process the stimuli of pain without any accompanying qualia. It's impossible to know, but I also think it's immoral to assume that they don't and that it's ok to hurt animals.

(btw, the fact that almost all moral systems are implicitly based on the existence of qualia is what makes a lot of people so leery about qualophobes, regardless of the evidence.)

This isn't obvious to me. Actually since qualia fluctuate over time, it seems to me that they are almost certainly processes.

How do qualia fluctuate in your view? Do you mean only if the stimuli changes? We would agree there. But not if the stimuli remains the same. They seem to be point-like experiences to me. Sure, a color will fade if you look at it too long because the rods in your eyes get saturated, but that's a different issue.

A desktop computer is a serial processor and will process these in sequence... whereas our brain's architecture is massively parallel, allowing it to perform many computations simultaneously. 

Actually, modern computers are massively parallel as well. I'm not denying that the brain processes imagery in parallel. Obviously it does. What bothers me is that these parallel processes then seem to produce outputs that are presented to our awareness as a unity.

Blindsight shows that visual stimuli response can function independently of any visual experience. This is a major problem for reductionists.

I have a feeling you're going to tell me this doesn't help, but I'm not sure why.

I'm concerned with how we experience a process as a unity, a point-like experience. That's where I see a weakness in the reductionist argument. 

If the non-reductionists can somehow tame the zoo of qualia, I might "go over" to their side. I'm not there yet though. I'm more thinking a third approach might be needed, but I have no idea what that could be. 

I'm also more sympathetic now than I used to be to the epistemological pessimists who think the mind can no more think about itself than a hammer can hammer itself, that our minds are designed to be "turned outwards towards the world" and that too much introspection on mental states inevitably leads to logical knots, simply because we're not designed to process that sort of information.
 




 I'm not too familiar with this position. Is this Dennett's view?

More or less. Though he's too canny to ever say so in such simple terms, in my reading he thinks both qualia and consciousness are "null pointers" - words that don't really refer to anything meaningful. For a while I thought he had the true picture - right down the the competing networks of Darwinian neurons fighting for dopamine - but now I'm not so sure.

higher vs. lower functions...

I would take a Heideggerian approach to this question. Anything "ready to hand" that we can use in a transparent fashion without  rational thinking is a lower function, even if it was set by practicing it as a higher function (for example that choke hold, which had to be puzzled out and learned before it became automatic) Anything "unready to hand" that requires us to activate our reasoning skills is a higher function. 

I'm not sure if I agree with the entailment from propositional attitudes to qualia or not. If I say "I believe that 2+2=4" how would we characterize the corresponding quale?

*Believing* it, as opposed to merely using the fact in a process, would entail the quale of the emotion of belief, the feeling we get when we look at something we know to be true. 2 + 2 = 5 is not just a false statement, it triggers a different quale when we see it (in the qualophile's view.)

we want to know why all this processing is accompanied by "inner feels." Maybe 'qualia' is not the best concept with which to get a handle on the problem, but turning a blind eye to it doesn't seem like a solution.

Exactly.  I agree. However, the reason *why* I agree has to do with the simultaneity of visual perception, which I will try to explain below.

I think a strong case can be made for the existence of qualia in non-linguistic animals (think animal pain, blue dot on the forehead test, food preferences, etc.)

I'm not sure. If you believe in qualia, you believe there's a difference between "seeing blue" the way a computer can (or seeing a face the way Cottrel's network can), and really *seeing blue* (seeing the quale not processing the wavelength.) Since we can't communicate like this with animals, we can't know for certain either way.

Damn. Sorry man, I'm just not understanding why this is a problem.

Ok, I'll be glad to try again. Thanks for sticking with this discussion! 

Reductionist theories of mind run into a problem when they encounter mental phenomena that *don't seem to be processes*. Thought is a process. Emotion, Demasio and others have argued with merit, is a process. Qualia are obviously not processes but the very concept of qualia is shaky. 

But what about visual perception? Phenomenologically, it doesn't seem (and seeming is what's important here, since we're talking about inner states) that I see first the cat, then the lamp, and process these two concepts like a computer program would that could recognize multiple objects in a picture (these do exist.)

Rather, I seem to apprehend both of them *at the same time*. Visual perception appears not to be a process but rather a *pointlike experience* that is nevertheless very rich in data.

It is the nature of visual perception, at once pointlike in time and vast in the amount of stimuli that is perceived, that seems very un-process-like.

If we accept that it is not a process, we should also be more open to the idea that other non-processed mental states like qualia also might exist (where there's one monkey, there's more...). 

I'm starting to suspect that qualia might indeed exist, and only be *mediated* by language, which can open or foreclose access to them depending on the grammar, and not created as an illusion of language, and the reason there's no sharp cutoff between "redness" and "orangeness" is because there's just one color qualia that exists as a continuum.

But this opens a huge can of worms. Qualia must either be null or *radically* Other, beyond all category of thought or understanding. Even a thoroughgoing dualism in the traditional sense seems to leave no room for qualia. You would need an unbounded pluralism of incommensurable experiences, each its own separate ineffable Universe and yet somehow united within our minds. That sounds like the sort of conceptual disaster that usually results from having started from wrong premises.

So I'm still torn on the qualia issue.

Is there a wiki page on this?

I couldn't find anything more specific than stuff on qualia and the Hard Problem. There are some technical articles that talk about the problems of simultaneity and I remember reading about this issue in Penrose and Chalmers (who proposed quantum and dualistic solutions, respectively.) 




 making the most serious attempts to give a legitimate explanation of qualia (as opposed to the defeatists who seem to suggest that qualia are magical and inexplicable).

Or those who think they're just a trick of language?

"Language of thought" folks believe that this is essentially language-like whereas eliminativists of the Churchland variety think that the brain's basic cognitive processes are rather non-language-like

I think both views are simplistic. Our "higher" cognitive functions are obviously language-like in processing, at least in my view, whereas "instinct"-type reactions are not. Habits fall in between the two - that's why they can be so hard to break.

As far as I can tell the questions are entirely independent. 

Why I think the two issues are fundamentally the same is that, as far as I understand the concept, a propositional attitude must have an intentional object. It is hard to see how such an object can be anything other than a quale. 

If there truly are propositional attitudes such as "I would like to have a beer," rather than simple processes that report such sentences as part of their functioning, then the quale for the taste of beer is implied.

I know the eliminationists don't believe in these attitudes, and I thought they didn't believe in quales either, but you say they are merely "reductionist" in relation to quales. I don't quite see the difference because according to the classic definition at least, quales are irreducible. A reduced quale is a non-existent one.

Skeptical in what sense? Skeptical that the term 'qualia' refers to anything at all? 

Yes. For a while I was in the "it's all just a trick of language" school and I still think those arguments have a lot of merit. For example, if there is a quale that embodies "redness," when we see a color shift for example in a computer graphics display, we should notice a sharp cutoff where "redness" changes to "orangeness," but we don't. 

Also, people who speak languages that don't distinguish between "blue" and "green," Japanese for example, have been shown to be able to see less shades in that color range than English-speakers. All this points to quales somehow arising from language and not being fundamental.

Where I've started to doubt that view, however, is in the appearance of the simultaneity of visual perception. Looking at the room right now, I see a lamp, and a cat, *apparently at the same time*, and as distinct objects, not a blob combining the qualities of both (a furry, purring lamp for example.) 

How is this possible? If the mind is a mere process, how does this perception arise? There should only be reaction to visual stimuli, as with the Blindsight phenomenon, but nothing else. Yet something else appears that, unlike color quales, it is quite difficult to explain as a trick of language.

Before you chalk me up as a disciple of the Time Cube guy, the two dimensions of time and String Theory stuff was partly tongue-in-cheek, but this problem seems so vexing I wonder if this or a similarly bizarre explanation will eventually be needed.

What I was referring to is that in String Theory there are "extra" dimensions that are not linear, but rather curled around the three dimensions we know and love. Much like a tightrope walker will perceive a tightrope as one dimension, but an ant will see two (the ant can go forward and backward as well as around the "curled up" dimension that composes the rope itself.), in String Theory at a small scale our Universe has 10 or 11 spatial dimensions, not 3.

What I was proposing was that perhaps time also has a String Theory-like "curled up" dimension and that's how visual perception can be a process yet still somehow seem presented as a unity to the mind.

And of course Roger Penrose is a physicist who became interested in the philosophy of the mind and concluded that quantum physics must somehow be involved, launching an entire industry of bad New Age books misinterpreting his ideas. 




 Thanks for the detailed reply. You're lucky you got to work with some of the most eminent modern philosophers - whether I agree with them or not, that's quite an experience and one I wish I could have had.

So obviously your experience with them is very extensive and I'll take your word for it on what their true views are. However, I am puzzled by a couple of things you said:

believe that neuroscience science will explain qualia.

That is the qualophobic position, if I am correct. "phobic" is just an unfortunate appelation that this position got stuck with. It doesn't literally mean they are *afraid* to address the issue qualia, just that they think qualia can be reduced to neurology without either a dualistic or an emergent order.

they all agree that there is something wrong with folk psychology but they can disagree radically as to what (for the Churchlands, it's propositional attitudes, for others it's qualia or consciousness).

I don't think there's really much of a difference between propositional attitudes and qualia, fundamentally. They both seem to refer to mental states that can't be reduced to mere *processes*, and that's the real issue in my book.

I'm pretty skeptical about qualia myself, both internal and external, but the one phenomenon I don't think has been explained is the simultaneity of distinct objects of visual perception, and that one thread kind of lets everything else in again through the back door. 

It's not enough to say that vision merely *appears* simultaneous, obviously it's not and many studies have proven this (including the infamous "gorilla" experiment), because it's appearances that are the issue. Why should it appear simultaneous? How does this unity, however illusory it might be, manifest? I don't know of any reductionist philosopher who's explained that to my satisfaction.

I have an admittedly crazy theory that there are two dimensions of time, the other one curled up around our familiar dimension like the extra dimensions of String Theory, and that the unity of visual perception is processed in that dimension, using some Penrose-style quantum woo-woo hand-waving, and then somehow "presented" back to the ordinary mind as a unity.

So if you don't think I'm entirely bonkers after hearing that, I'd love to hear any further thoughts you might have on the subject, given that even formidable minds have said what we should do with this issue is just "sweep it aside and hope for the best" 
 




 I think he meant in physics, where three dimensions are privileged (see r3m0t's post), but that's interesting - I never knew that. 




 I don't think any philosopher from Plato on would disagree that "love" is a muddled concept that refers to many different things. 

I do think the Churchlands are far more radical than the rather uncontroversial critique you ascribe to them: In my reading of their position, they think "love" refers to not many different states, but to *nothing* - that the behaviors we ascribe to "love" have *no affective states behind them whatsoever*, any more than there is some being called Zeus behind the phenomenon of thunder.

In essence they are extreme qualophobes - they not only deny external qualia like "red," but internal qualia as well such as emotions. Some see them and the rest of the EM school as the heirs to the Behaviorists, but all the Behaviorists said was that the "black box" of internal states could not be studied scientifically - they never said that internal states didn't exist.

I've by no means read their corpus, so their position may have evolved since my last encounter with their work, but that's how I read their position at the time.

 Before you suggest "Ghost in the Shell," this was NOT Ghost in the Shell, I've seen every movie and episode, and this wasn't it.

What I remember for sure: It was quite similar to Ghost in the Shell. It involved cops in Japan with tank-like robot assistants. The plot was convoluted, but in the end it was revealed the evil mastermind was an old man who lived in a giant dome who was trying to merge trees and robots to create a new form of life. In the end his plot was foiled, but all the tank-robots were destroyed in the process.

 It also doesn't take into account the issue of land-values, on which productivity has no effect.

Productivity does affect land value. For example, after the invention of the elevator and modern building techniques, the value of land in or near a city increased dramatically due to the fact you can fit more people and/or make more products with the same amount of land than you could previously.

Likewise, the Internet and telepresence technology has affected land value, but in the opposite direction (reducing demand)

 There might be a mint there, but only if you can get past the media screaming about "ebonics" or some such nonsense. I can just imagine Limbaugh now: "New fake IQ test racist against whites! Makes blacks seem smart when they're not!"

As other posters mentioned, this is really a non-issue: Murray's own data shows economic status was the determining variable, not race, even if we admit "race" as a coherent, measurable concept, which I and most scientists have serious doubts about anyway. Remember there was a time when Italians and Jews were not considered "white," and now they are. 




 I agree, but that's not the conclusion he drew in the book. 




 He also fails to mention the rise of the war on drugs, and the increasingly large portion of the black male population that is in jail.

He did note that he focused exclusively on whites to avoid "ethnic issues." But the fact that this guy's book is called "The State of White America" raises the creepy level in the room just a bit. If this is the same Charles Murray who wrote "The Bell Curve," which suggested that blacks "naturally" have an IQ level 15 points below whites, it all starts to fit together. He's not worried about blacks because he thinks they're beyond hope anyway. 





























 The Dry Tortugas are indeed in the Caribbean. This is a different island with a similar name. "Tortuga" is Spanish for "turtle." 



















 I would prefer to use the term "strength of effect" when referring to a linear coefficient, and I would prefer that it be used in replacement of or at least along with correlation when reporting how variables are linked. 









 Only in our Galaxy. 




 In terms of pure math, you are correct, but when the general public hears the words "strongly correlated," that's not what they think. It is possible, after all to have some form of cancer be "strongly correlated" with weight, and yet have it that a 160 lb. person has a 2.1% chance of the cancer whereas a 250 lb. person has a 2.2% chance of the cancer. In cases like these unit invariance is irrelevant - reporting such a link as "strongly correlated" is misleading, even though technically accurate. 




 No... part of what it's showing is you get the same correlation value for many different patterns. Even if you just look at linear patterns, you can get the same correlation value with radically different slopes on the best-fit line. Two quantities can have a correlation of close to 1 (which would seem to imply a strong relation) and yet still be only weakly related in reality if the slope of the best-fit line is close to 0.

 Cartoons in general, especially old cartoons. The Macy's balloons really creep me out. 
























 I don't really think you get what I'm trying to say. Read the other posts in this thread, they explain it better than I do.

The point is, 0!=1 is not a "tack on" that has nothing to do with the rest of the definition of a factorial and is just there for convenience so we don't end up dividing by zero. It is implied by the original definition. 




 Then the same can be argued about any mathematical function. It's not a "convention" in the way that placing the dependent variable on the left-hand side of an equation is a "convention."  0!=1 is suggested by the underlying concept itself, not just inherited tradition. 




 It's a convention, not a theorem. It's been chosen like that because it's useful.

No, that is not correct, it is in the structure of the idea of the factorial. Think of a baseball team of x players. There are x! ways for the coach to order them on a bench for photo. Now imagine if the coach simply wanted a picture of the empty bench (0 players.) There is only one way to order that photo. Therefore 0!=1

A similar argument can be made for the "inevitability" of such seemingly "hacky" definitions such as a^0 = 1. 


































 The reaction uses a secret catalyst

Stopped reading right there. Just another Cold Fusion scam and-or self-delusion. 




 I don't think we need any fancy Category Theory to solve this problem as some other posters have suggested.

You merely have to distinguish between declarable and constructable entities. For example, I can *declare* "a square circle" by saying these words, but I could never actually construct one.

Similarly, in Set Theory we can say "The set of all sets," but it is not clear if we mean declarable or constructable sets. The set of all declarable sets includes some sets which trigger Russel's Paradox, and thus are not constructable.

When a mathematician is saying "all sets this, all sets that," he is most likely referring to the set of all *constructable* sets.  




 Why a vow to free beings - or even just one's own being- if there are no beings to free?

Empty of *inherent* selfhood does not mean total emptiness of being, but rather than our selves are unavoidably dependent on the existence of other beings (dependent origination.)

So this is where the vow originates to free all beings - it cannot be any other way, since all being is tied up together. 




 I wasn't going as far back as Smith - just pointing out that Libertarianism was around when any person living today was in High School. 




 True, but if you have to have a graphic metaphor, horseshoe beats grid. Libertarianism, if not the modern Party, has been around quite some time. The grid metaphor got started as the "Nolan Chart." Nolan was a Libertarian. 









 Because as any high school politics student knows, political alignments are not on a line (they're more on a grid, with x and y coordinates, etc.) 

I'm more of a "horseshoe" guy. I think that grid is Libertarian propaganda: "Wow, look, there's a party that believes in *both* types of freedom!" 

Right and left are labels given by American propagandists in the McCarthy era.

No, they come from where the factions sat in the French National Assembly after the Revolution.

His mistake was making his country a socialist dictatorship (communism), rather than a socialist republic.

I don't think he had a choice once he seized power. The majority of the Russian people in 1917 were rural and religious. They would not have voted for Bolshevism if given the chance. A Tolstoy-style religious socialism might have had a better shot. 




 Doesn't matter what they actually do or the fact that social programs are not 'socialism'

Yes, I like how people do not get that social programs are actually a phenomenon of capitalism. There is no welfare in Socialism because everyone is guaranteed a job (and compelled to work.) 

I'm not saying that's a *good* thing, but welfare is Capitalism *preserving* itself from a possible Socialist uprising.

One of Lenin's slogans was "He who does not work, does not eat." Makes him sound like a Tea Party guy, which he was in some strange way, that way the far left and the far right always seem to converge.
 




 Elaborate perhaps? 









 Turkey pasta. Better than it sounds. 




  Politics has always contained a transcendental element (often a phony one used as a lure, but that's a different issue.) In terms of an incentive, few things beat the promise or even the hope of transcendence. 




 "the flawed, selfish nature of man" is a religious percept.

Maybe, but also a Darwinian one. I don't think you can ignore that without socialization to the contrary, human beings care about themselves, their "tribe," and little else. 




 The simple man wonders what's for dinner.

 It was probably similar to those old questions on the SAT about culture-specific stuff that were designed to keep Jews out of Harvard. Taffy is probably something poor Koreans don't see much of. 




 The school system can fail kids without repercussions if needed. The budget isn't set according to how many students graduate. 

This is key. In the US there is tremendous pressure on teachers to pass everyone because funding and ratings are based on "on-time" graduation rates.

 My only disappointment was getting to the bottom and finding out Qu8k isn't for sale (yet...) 





























 Very interesting. Thanks for the response. One thing you said in particular caught my eye:

There are castes among Christians and Muslims too. 

We often read in the Western media that low-caste Hindus and Dalits are converting to Islam or Christianity to escape the caste system. Is that exaggerated or false in your view?
 




 I know some Hindus (and a former one) who would disagree with you. It is true though that there is no central authority in Hinduism, so different groups might have different interpretations. 

By and large though, Hinduism is an inherited tradition. You can't just go sign up to become Hindu like you can for some other religions. The "Western Hindu" groups like the Hare Krishnas and the Rajneeshis are considered fake, heretical or just plain laughable by (most) actual Hindus. 




 Assuming "The West" means the current hegemonic system lead by the United States, I would advise you to beware the "rhetoric of decline" which is used for political manipulation and doesn't really represent the underlying reality. The US is still the world's largest manufacturer, food exporter and its military technology is light-years ahead of anyone else's.

Unfortunately a number of commenters here have bought in to this rhetoric full-scale. For example, one stated:

china and other nations find themselves with a young strong backbone 

China does not have a young, strong backbone. They overshot their population decades ago, experienced apocalyptic levels of starvation several times, and are still paying the price. Their demographics are completely upside down now and the very old will soon outnumber those of working age.

I wouldn't be surprised if the US, Latin America and India form the power troika of 40 years hence while China, Japan and Europe all suffer greatly just from demographic pressure alone. 

The US will probably no longer be the lone superpower c. 2050 but it's quite possible it will still be one of the top dogs.  




 American Indians can be Hindus too if they want

Not Orthodox. You have to be born in the caste system to be considered Hindu. They could always be Hare Krishnas or something though. 



















 I suspected it might be something like this. However, would it be possible to create substances that are *digestible*, but, for whatever reason, don't give any energy to the body and/or cannot be stored as fat? Or would that create metabolic havoc?

Ok, maybe not.
 




 The government of Zimbabwe is pretty powerful, at least internally. Just ask all their political prisoners and dispossessed farmers. 




 If relatively harmless drugs like marijuana were legal, people wouldn't do this synthetic stuff. It should be banned, but then, pot should be legal as well. 




 That's my point though. Habitual drug users with no history of violence all of a sudden go nuts when they use this stuff. It might be close chemically to THC but in terms of reaction it's more like PCP. It's a drug that is a danger to the public, not just to its users. 




 [Here is one story](http://www.wwaytv3.com/2011/09/01/one-dead-another-custody-after-overnight-shooting-rocky-point). You can find plenty more searching police registers and medical journals. 

There was a case in a town near ours of a guy high on "bath salts" who tunneled into his neighbor's basement trying to kill him because he thought the guy was having sex with his wife. He had been a longtime marijuana user with no criminal record beyond possession and no history of mental illness.

Part of the problem with "bath salts" is they can be many different chemicals - you don't know what you're getting. I agree with a previous poster who said if marijuana was legal none of this would be happening, because most often this stuff is advertized as "legal pot" and sold in skate shops, head shops, etc. which pot users frequent. 




 He argues that a gold standard would force the government back into the price-fixing business. Not sure that's correct, but an interesting perspective. 




 Do you know anyone who's done this stuff? I'm fine with people using drugs that kill them, not so fine with them using drugs that cause them to go nuts and kill other people.  




 This stuff is bad news. Lifelong potheads have tried it once and ended up in the loony bin. For once I don't have a problem with the DEA. 









 don' think human nature is very malleable (which is the most basic idea of any kind of socialism: that people are programmed by relations and circumstances)

Good post, but I'd disagree with you there. Many Socialists believe there is a basic unchangeable human nature, for example Marx's idea of "primitive Communism" representing the original state of Man that will eventually reappear in the final state.

In this view Capitalism is the temporary, un-natural aberration which is part of the reason why it will collapse. 














 I paid $8.50 for a birthday card at Hallmark. 99 cent store will be getting my greeting card business in the future. 




 True, but you can often counter-sue for damages that include your legal fees. I don't know how often that succeeds though. 









 Thanks, but it doesn't appear to be on the soundtrack. It was just background music to a few of the fights - the chanting might not have even been part of the "official" music track at all, I just really dug the combination. 









 Yeah, not quite what I had in mind, but thanks. 




 I heard such music in the background of a show (Soul Eater) and can't get the idea out of my head. Can't track down the artist though.  




 Ah, it looks like only the first two parts are posted with more to come tomorrow. Sorry guys. I liked the first two parts so much I posted before I realized that was all there was. 





























 It has not been established that the original speakers of IE are related genetically to the majority of today's speakers. The language is thought to have spread more from prestige influence and trade than military conquest, except in its earliest spread into the Danube Valley, where there is evidence of warfare.

So it's not like "some black people speak French" and more like "most people who speak French are unrelated to the original French nation, which we know very little about anyway since it ceased to exist 5000 years ago." 




 I don't think you can conflate "Aryan" and "white." The original people who used the word "Arya" probably were lighter-skinned, since they were from the steppes of Russia, but there are non-IE-speaking people who have light skin also, such as the Finns and Hungarians, and many darker-skinned people who speak IE languages and practice a descendant of the "Aryan" religion (most Hindus, for example.) IE is a language group, not a race. 









 "Arya" was a word in certain branches of Satem Indo-European that meant "priest," "aristocrat," or "practitioner of the correct religion or correct rituals" depending on the context. It was not used to mean "tribe" or "race." 

It is much more correct to speak of an Aryan religion that is the ancestor of both Vedic Hinduism and Zoroastrianism than an Aryan race.
 




 Cash did claim God gave him that song in a dream when he was high on Quaaludes, for what it's worth. 




 Yes, but depth like this is why people like it. 














 Here in Michigan the private schools pay for their own buses, textbooks, etc...

Are you sure? I thought that was true in my state as well until a state senator told me otherwise. I was pretty shocked that my taxes pay to bus, heat and equip religious schools.

Have coaches teach gym class. 

They usually do, but they get a separate salary for coaching, at least in most districts in my area.

Require any part of the uniform that isn't customized to be returned at the end of the year (specifically, pants).

Haha, do you know what football uniforms look like by the end of the season? Usually there are multiple uniforms per player for each season because they rip and wear out.

private schools either learn to manage their finances REALLY well, or they disappear because they can't pay the bills.

Or they get the public to foot the bill for them, without any public oversight or standardized test "accountability" that public schools have to follow. Where I live, even some public schools are run by for-profit companies and are exempt from most state regulations, including the obligation to educate special-needs and learning-disabled students. It's sick. 




  How did these right winger Italians get to be so racist? You'd be hard pressed to find a more motley assortment of racial mixing than within the Italian peninsula. 

You've answered your own question. Racial identity anxiety is known to be linked with increased racism. See the American South with its rampant underground "miscegenation" during the pre-Civil War period for another example.

Niall Ferguson covers this issue in [The War of the World](http://www.amazon.com/War-World-Twentieth-Century-Conflict-Descent/dp/1594201005) - the book can be a bit dry but the section on racial anxiety is well worth reading. 




 Prior to the Putsch, as I understand it, the Nazis were a legal party from 1925 onwards TO the Putsch.

The Beer Hall Putsch was in 1923, you've got it backwards. They were briefly banned (and Hitler was jailed under cushy conditions), but legalized again in 1925. 









 At least in my state, joining the union is voluntary. That may not be true everywhere. 




 Actually, public districts are required by law (at least in my state) to bus private students as well, and even pay for the textbooks and heating costs of private schools (except for religious textbooks.)

Sports cost more than you think - coaches are paid in most districts, uniforms, league fees and transportation are expensive, as is insurance, and "the field" in sports-crazy towns is often more like a minor-league stadium. Then there's the marching band - I know for a fact a large district near me has a marching band budget of nearly $100,000 per year.

Disputes over grades and discipline should be handled by the teacher and the student's family, and maybe the school authorities if necessary. When it comes to grade disputes, parents should be required to provide evidence that their student did not earn the grade received or that the assignment was graded unfairly.

Here I agree with you, but that's not the reality of how things work these days.
 




 Salaries of union officials come from union dues, not district budgets. 









 You're probably right about the present time, there is more violent indoctrination among Muslims. However, most Muslims - ever very conservative ones - specifically forbid attacks on civilians, Muslims or not, and if you've seen movies like "Jesus Camp" you will know that Christians have "madrassas" of their own. 









 Only if you restrict your time frame considerably. Over the long frame of history I'd say both religions are equally bloodthirsty. 




 He is an [Obscurantist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscurantist#Restricting_knowledge) - he doesn't personally believe in the religion, but he thinks it is necessary for social cohesion.

Of course the media won't use that term... it's too, well, obscure. 




 Don't forget: They can expel disruptive students. Public schools cannot (unless they have committed an actual crime, like dealing drugs or assault, and even then sometimes they are only kicked out for 6 months or a year.) 




 A lot of times, the administrators are the Creationists. That's the small-town reality. 




 I'm all for paying teachers more, but where the hell is all that money going?

Administration, sports, legal costs (districts are sued constantly when they dare to actually fail or discipline kids), busing costs (no public transportation in most areas means districts maintain huge bus fleets of their own), physical plant (there are a lot of $100M-plus HS buildings in the US with terrible academics). 




 Save money and hire an inexpensive recent grad. Look good to the school board and the negative affects aren't seen until you've hopped to a different job. This BS goes on all the time in Nursing as well which is why unions are popular in both professions. 




 Those sorts of salaries are extremely unusual for public education. They do exist in some very wealthy districts, though. 




 Yep. Given the attitudes towards education in the US, without unions teachers would be earning close to minimum wage, and the jobs would be filled without regard to qualifications or knowledge at all, and would require a political connection to get.

(This all describes how most teaching jobs were actually filled in the early 60's and before, before the union movement really got started.) 




 Yeah, I get that sensory "vagueness" also, except with visuals which are very clear. 




 I was surprised to read that there is no smell or taste in dreams because that part of the brain is shut off during REM sleep. But come to think of it, I've never experienced smell or taste in a dream.

If this is legit, it could be a very effective way to check to see if you're dreaming. So my question is - has anyone experienced smell or taste in dreams?

I'm headed to bed to test the theory myself...

**UPDATE:** Didn't work. I ate a whole box of chocolates, and I thought I was tasting them, although, upon awakening, I couldn't recall the taste. So, maybe there is no taste in dreams, but if you *think* you're tasting anyway, it's useless as a reality check. 









 The Ice Age was over 10,000 years ago. It did not end in the Middle Ages. 









 I read somewhere you would only need 50 digits of pi to compute the circumference of a circle to the nearest millimeter when it had a radius as big as the Universe, but I don't know whether or not that's true. 




 Also, I've always been curious if there is a similar series definition for pi. Wikipedia was not much help on either subject.

 no one would suggest that the bartender who sold them the alcohol is the one responsible for the death.

Actually where I live, bartenders are legally responsible, so most bars take your keys at the door and you have to breathalyze before you get them back. We have among the lowest rate of alcohol-related driving injuries in the country, so it seems to work. 




 I do agree that there would be far fewer deaths if it could be sold on the open market.

Yes, but no one would want to sell it, because there still would be deaths, and the companies that made it would be sued out of existence unless they were given Congressional Immunity like the vaccine makers.

Then you'd just be back to your shady unreliable local "entrepreneur" just like now. 




 Absolutely correct, I was just demonstrating that probabilities can be calculated over infinite quantities.  




 If there are an infinite number of both, there is no way to start the argument

Sure there is - you can do probabilities over infinite quantities. For example, in almost all randomly chosen intervals on the set of natural numbers (which is infinite), you are more likely to pick a composite than a prime number, for example. 




 Not exclusively, though Marx did use it, and it is a term exclusive to the Left as far as I know (the Right would deny the very existence of rentiers.) 




 Thanks, this is the best explanation so far. I have another question for you: Is the Uncertainty Principle a *universal* principle of any conceivable universe, that is, is it a mathematical necessity? Or, are "Newtonian" Universes mathematically possible, but it just so happens that we don't live in one?

I asked this question on reddit before but no one seemed to have a good answer. 




 Actually, it only works if there *are* infinite universes, the way I understand it.  




 I've seen that before, but his definition of "nothing" was also "quantum foam," whatever that is. Not exactly "nothing" in the philosophical sense. 




 Is there a difference though between "quantum fluctuations" - which would seem to imply a pre-existing set of laws - and actual nothingness? Because Hawking clearly states "out of nothing." 




 There's good reason to think not. For example the ["Boltzmann's Brain"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain) argument. 



















 There were rumors about where Brokmeyer had gone; it was said he was conducting a Hegel-focused kindergarten class for the Creek Indians in the wilds of the Oklahoma territory. He assured his friends he was still alive by sending intricately whittled walking sticks to their St. Louis addresses.

 Not that I necessarily believe this "shipwrecked Indians" story, but is a canoe traversal from Greenland to Iceland, thence onwards to the Faroes or Orkneys and Scotland or Norway essentially impossible? Let's assume a well-stocked Inuit canoe that had just finished a large seal or walrus hunt was blown into the open ocean by a storm. They reach Iceland and then decide this was an intervention by "the gods" or something and decide to press on. Could they conceivably have survived and reached Europe?

 The drug is pretty much a key plot element throughout the series though, so I wouldn't call it a deus ex machina. The "machina" at the end of Dune was of a more literal kind!

 Me too, I just wake up. I've never experienced this void state. 




 Nothing bizarre happened, but there were some people roaming around very much alive who are very much dead in reality (relatives, etc.) The realism was pitch-perfect and even though I knew (correctly) that it was a dream, after a while I was convinced that I had somehow entered a parallel universe.

Anyone else ever done a reverse RC and convinced themselves that they were awake when they were really dreaming? 




 Wouldn't surprise me. I think the "changing text" RC is one of the least reliable. There's all kinds of pseudoscience about how the higher reasoning functions in your brain are deactivated during dreaming so you can't read coherently or form complex thoughts. I think there's *some* truth to this (my thinking is always muddy in dreams, even in Lucid Dreams), but the reading stuff is not supported by the first-hand experiences of people on this board and others. 




 Sooo... I was a female librarian in Siberia, in the year 450 AD 




 The theory is, you can read in lucid dreams, but when you check back the same text again, it's totally different. You're supposed to be able to do the same thing with clocks. I've never been able to test this, in my lucid dreams no text or clocks ever show up. 




 While we're at it... I don't think Sacha Baron Cohen is funny at all, and a Jewish guy making such vicious fun of Muslim/Arab cultures is more than a little icky in my book.

 Don't know then. I would see a doctor to make sure you don't have any heart defects and if you don't, then I wouldn't worry about it. The heart rate charts you see at the gym are only population averages, as others have pointed out, each individual is different.

That is interesting. What prophets were believed to have come before Abraham?

 Louie is great, but it's a lot more serious and introspective than Seinfeld. The standup cut-outs are about the only thing the two shows have in common. 

Curb is I know by the same creator, but it just seems fundamentally different to me somehow. It's a creature of the reality-show age - Seinfeld, despite its postmodernism, wasn't. 





























 I have heard this theory, probably from the same TV show as the OP. The argument made by the documentary was that the symptoms of the Aztec plague did not match any known European disease. It's quite possible in my mind that, after being weakened by European diseases, native diseases that the Aztecs previously resisted spread and ended up finishing them off. 

However, the documentary focused solely on the Aztecs and not the wider downfall of the native civilizations in the new world. It is a known fact that a lot of them succumbed to smallpox and this is attested to by skeletal and DNA evidence. It was in part because this evidence was supposedly lacking with the Aztecs that the documentary made the argument that it did. They even had, if I remember correctly, some people on who claimed this disease spread back to Europe and was responsible for some of the later outbreaks of "plague" where the symptoms were quite different from those of the Black Death. 




 A lot of info is from [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Un-pharaon-republicain-Enquetes-Edition/dp/2733906143) (only in French, sorry). I don't know much about the reputation of the author as a historian, but some these sites described in the book do actually exist. 




 Several sources ranging from academic to downright dubious claim he though he had a literally divine mission to rule France, that he was outwardly a Socialist, but secretly part of a Fascist cult known as "The Hood," that he built an obelisk covered in Masonic symbols and would meditate beneath it at night, etc. etc.

It all sounds pretty crazy but unlike most other conspiracy theories this one seems to have some evidence behind it. What do you guys think?

 




 Tuition only covers part of the cost. Taxpayers pay the rest. 




 That's basically what I want to know - can these families be traced back to Roman forebears, are they barbarian families that were "Italianized" over time, or some combination of the two?

Or is their origin genuinely unknown due to the lack of historical records in that time period? 




 For the most part, we have government doing important stuff. 

Not so much anymore. So many important functions have been privatized, at this point I think you can legitimately increase the scope of government without impinging on things that the private sector does better. Study after study, for instance, have shown that private "charter" schools perform worse than traditional public schools, despite the fact that charter schools can pick and choose their students. And of course the privatization of important security and military functions has been widely documented. 




 The breathing exercises, the sitting postures and some of the simpler standing postures can be verified back 1000+ years, though not back to the time of the Vedas.

The more gymnastic stuff is a modern concoction, as was recently shown in the NY Times (link is in the top comment.) Yoga shorn of its doctrinal, religious element is also a modern phenomenon, but you probably already knew that. 




 I second that recommendation. It's quite interesting how he maps out the process by which the ultra-religious society of the Middle Ages collapsed *from within*, not because of papal corruption or the rise of science as a rival doctrine per se, but more because the natural development of its own dogma led to unbearable contradictions and conflicts.

Seeing science as a natural offshoot of religion (study God by studying His creation), that eventually turned against its ideological "parent" is quite revealing. 




 TIL. I never had any idea such places existed. I figured Tom Hanks had to go to get his license renewed just like the rest of us. Any more info on these departments? I am curious. 




 Government is not 40% of GDP in the US. Maybe in some European countries. But your wider argument is valid. 




 Government work is about being compliant with rules, fair to all stake holders, and risk minimizing. 

I see no problem with parts of the economy being run on those lines. If it is the whole economy of course, that is a recipe for stagnation. But I also think that running the whole economy on the profit principle is a recipe for destruction. Call me a mushy moderate but I think a proper balance is necessary. 




 Unfortunately the Supreme Court doesn't see it that way. In my state, taxpayers already fund all the expenses of religious schools (mainly Catholic) except teacher salaries and *religious* textbooks. Everything else: Physical maintenance, other textbooks, transportation, even heating and air conditioning costs, are borne by the public. 




 Almost all folks in the government are sincere and trying to do a good job. And they do accomplish big, complex things. But when we bid on government work, we routinely doubled the time required.

Might that not be because of the very complexity of what government does, as opposed to, say, Starbucks? 




 Maybe so, but I've lived in a number of different areas (rural, suburban, urban), and not particularly wealthy areas either - and one or two were definitely downscale, and I've never had a bad experience at either place.

Contrast that with the hundreds of frustrations that I've had with private corporations' customer service makes me look askance at people who say government is always less efficient. 









 I haven't noticed much difference between any of the three on the receiving end. When choosing shipping I just use whatever's cheaper. When shipping things I always use the post office. They are a lot more knowledgeable and helpful in my experience (and cheaper too.) 




 Debt levels really aren't that extreme in Europe, the problem is there is now a disconnect between the people making fiscal policy (nations) and the people making monetary policy (the EU). 




 I've been to the DMV.

Me too, and I've never had any problems. In fact I'm impressed with how well they handle the volume and the complexity of what they do. Same with the post office. 









 All true, I've just never thought about it in terms of energy output per unit of volume before.  














 It's any object whose existence depends on the existence of another object. For example, a physical body's existence is conditioned upon the existence of the atmosphere, the sun, etc. Since there is always change in the Universe, all conditioned objects are linked together and are thus always changing and ceasing their present form without end.

An unconditioned object, by contrast, is a metaphysically necessary object. It *must* exist, and stands outside the chain of dependence and change. Various philosophical traditions have differing views on this object. Of course in the Christian tradition it is God, the Buddhists call it Nirvana, etc. Some philosophies deny that any such object exists. 




 Technically, the rule in Buddhist doctrine is "every *conditioned object* is impermanent." Nirvana is considered the "undying element" since it is not conditioned. 




 Yep, I came here to say this. But it goes back further, to the long Tokugawa peace, when the warriors of the previous age were romanticized. Ironically, when violence came back to Japan in the Bakumatsu and the Boshin War, a lot of the combat actually took on the highly stylized "chivalric" character that the combatants *imagined* was how the Samurai fought pre-1600.

Legend became reality, and that continued right up through how the Japanese fought in WWII (courageously, but recklessly.) To take one example, Japanese fighter pilots were known to hold *live duels* with each other in their planes, sometimes even shooting each other down. This was tolerated by commanders as part of the "warrior spirit." Combat discipline was a huge problem in the Japanese Army in the pacific theater. Troops would charge when ordered not to, and would refuse to retreat to more defensible positions when ordered to do so. One cannot imagine Ieyasu or any other actual samurai-era commander condoning such foolishness.

It is interesting to read the accounts of actual samurai who fought before the Tokugawa period. There are lots of passages like "we encountered the enemy, but they outnumbered us, so we ran away," and "we were paid off so we switched sides," not so much emphasis on suicidal charges and undying devotion to the Daimyo or the like (though these things did happen occasionally - every legend has a kernel of truth.) 




 here was the Holy Roman Empire, which kings were eventually elected, which seems counterintuitive considering how the system is generally known.

Yes, but only by a handful of noble "electors," not by the general population. 




 Awesome, I didn't realize I was a government! 




 They are products of the modern media culture where everything has to be over-the-top and confrontational. Bertrand Russell they are not. However, I am not too worked up over this. The Religious Right have had their way bullying and silencing the rest of us for some time now, and if they're now getting fed a bit of their own medicine, well, turnabout is fair play. Facebook is not trivial - it's a major social forum these days, and if religious bigotry and ignorance goes unchallenged there,  that is a big deal.

However, that doesn't make Krauss someone who's actually had insights into fundamental ontology. He obviously hasn't, and to claim otherwise unfortunately weakens his political arguments, which I do by and large agree with. 




 I agree with you about Krauss, he really comes across as a charlatan. People who buy his book expecting a real answer to the Big Question are going to come away very disappointed. 




 Sure, I know some old white guys like that - blacks are "fine in their own way" but their culture is too different from ours and it would be better if we just split up into separate countries. They even say they like Malcolm X and guys like that because they also have the same beliefs (blacks and whites should be separate.)

They are just trying to make their racism seem more politically correct in my mind. But if you actually take them at their word, how would this ever be done? Can you imagine the chaos? It would be like the India-Pakistan partition times a thousand. And there are too many mixed-race people now for it to ever be practical.

Also I can guess which "country" would end up with all the economic and military resources. It wouldn't be the new "Negrostan." 




 I liked how the guy who said "you can tell I'm not Jewish just by looking at me" kinda looks like Adam Sandler. 




 Hey God, stop squeaking your chair! 




 The girls in the film have grown up now and have publicly renounced racism.  




 It makes a little more sense now, thanks. Relating it to something I know more about, it seems similar to using the Poisson distribution (where there are technically an infinite number of draws) to model a process that, while technically finite, is so large as to be practically infinite. 




 That last little bit of fat is good for you. Your body and especially brain need some fat reserves. I wouldn't freak about it as long as you feel good. 














 From what I understand, you can get it and be overwhelmed by the pleasure and snap out of it. This happened to me a few times, it wasn't a "freak out," but certainly a sense of "whoah, too much!" In my mind it's closely related  to Lacan's concept of *joissance* (overwhelming or "surplus" pleasure.) You have to "enlarge" your mind before you can handle it. 




 Yes, the brain processes complex stimuli. Where I think consciousness differs from this processing activity is in the *presentation* of the stimuli as an immediate whole.

I would say that "the awareness that one exists" as a "self" is subjectivity, or at least the beginnings of it, not consciousness. I would say consciousness precedes self-awareness.  




 I think that better defines subjectivity rather than consciousness. Consciousness seems to be immediate apprehension of a complex set of stimuli, not a process.  














 That's not a glitch, that's a peek at the assembly code. 




 You are defining consciousness as a disconnect between two elements, one of which is already consciousness. 




 He might have, but it is far less likely. Choice of venue is important. Attacking an institution where one studied or was employed instead of random civilians is psychologically significant.  




 consciousness is merely a disconnect between the automatic operations and the conscious operations of the brain.

Not trying to pick on you, but that contradictory sentence right at the beginning of your post shows just how hard it is to get at any coherent idea of consciousness. 




 My friend once had a dream where she was given a phone number *and address* by the "reincarnation" of a friend of hers who had died (yikes...) 

To my eternal frustration, she never called and soon forgot the number!! 




 The immigration part is what's illegal. And $250/month would be well under minimum wage. Still doesn't stop a lot of people from trying. 




 The link, again, does not lead to a workplace or school shooting. Also:

as of April 2008 he was unemployed and had to face severe financial difficulties.

which sort of goes with what I have been saying.  




 The higher incidence being at least partly related to guns was part of my original point (and the author's). Smith was not a school/workplace shooter.

If Goh had stayed in Korea he probably would have committed suicide without harming others, as that is how social antagonism often plays out in that country. 




 They have been shown to have a much higher incidence in the US than in other countries, and for different motivations, that is, they are almost never *overtly* political like the recent killings in Norway and France were.

Of course Goh was a sociopath, but you can't ignore the culture either. His most likely inborn mental illness was exacerbated by his cultural context, whereas other contexts would have been more likely to ameliorate it.  




 Night-vision goggles have infrared light emitters that aren't supposed to be seen with normal vision. Given the amount of drug trafficking and associated military/police activity in Texas, I don't think this was an alien. It's not clear to me from the video what the figure's distance is and if it was downhill or not. 

Also, Brad Steiger is not an "image expert," he is an author and a journalist.  




 There was a clear motive of self-interest - revenge and regaining lost honor. Perhaps the oldest motivation for violence and killing that exists. Focusing on the "irrational" aspects of this case denies the strong forces of cultural determination that the author of the article pointed out. The workplace/school shooting is as much a product of modern culture as the duel was of the 18th Century and the lynching in the 19th. 




 True, but what you said was such mass violence isn't influenced by poverty. I think that's incorrect and the African bush wars are a very good example. 




 That's a US Army soldier wearing night-vision goggles. I don't see where it appears "gigantic" at all.  




 I disagree, especially when the "war" is more of a chaotic mass looting and killing for no reason. The media interprets events in Africa through the lens of "Genocide," one tribe trying to wipe out another. What goes unreported is how often these forces *attack their own side*. 




 Actually in places like Africa, spree killings are so common, they're almost an institution. Ever hear of a brush war? 














 I don't think it was a protest - at least a conscious one - but I do think it was an economic decision. People with low economic status have "less to lose" by such acts and thus do not have as strong a motivation to repress violent urges as others. 




 250 million guns aren't connected to our political culture? As for poverty, that is definitely both a cause and an effect of political culture. I don't see how population really has much to do with it. If you wanted a similar unit of comparison you could use the European Union which has 300 million plus population as well. 




 Would you deny that there is a link in general between the very high levels of violence in America as opposed to other industrialized countries and the political culture in the US? Because if you admit that link I think you would have to admit the link between mass killings and the culture as a special case thereof. 




 You should have read that link a little more carefully:

Not included are school massacres, workplace killings, hate crimes or familicides, which form their own categories.

Each culture has its own version of the "rampage" or the "beserker" which says something about the stresses of that particular culture. In America the workplace and school shootings are more common - in Europe and Africa, overtly political rampages are more common. Again, don't discount that book before you read it. 




 You should read the author's book "Going Postal." This is by no means an isolated incident. It is part of a repeated and widespread sociological pattern. That Goh had problems beyond what society can be blamed for is not the point. The point is instead of ameliorating or controlling those problems, Goh's social context exacerbated them until he exploded. He is the latest in a long list of workplace and school shooters. 




 Every society has its psychopaths, but how that psychosis manifests does say something about the society. The 9/11 attackers did *say something* about Muslim society - even though of course they didn't represent the views of most Muslims. Anders Brevik's killing spree did *say something* about the tradition of White Nationalism and Nazi sympathy in the Nordic countries, even though most Norwegians abhor his views, etc.

Likewise, Goh's shootings do *say something* about the pervasive culture of economic scams and hypocritical religion in the US, even though there is of course much more to the US than scams and fundamentalist hucksters. 



















 [Here's an interview with Shostak](http://www.astrobio.net/debate/3036/technology-worlds) where he goes more in-depth and mentions Seyfert galaxies. 




 The two top candidates for these kinds of structure are Hoag's Object (a strange galaxy where stars have been separated by type - no one knows how), and Seyfert Galaxies - badly disturbed galaxies that some have speculated are "industrial accidents" left behind by Type III civilizations.

The artificial nature of these structures is by no means proven, but some reputable astronomers have speculated in that direction. 




 There is a very long taboo in a lot of Buddhist groups about claiming attainments, because it would start endless arguments about who was really Enlightened, etc. This kind of attitude was learned through hard experience. On the other hand, being super-mysterious about it has its disadvantages as well. 




 Sounds like you have Sleep Paralysis. Sufferers often report experiencing an evil presence in the room with them, often slowly coming towards them. It's something to do with the brain's self/other perception going haywire.

If you don't mind me asking, what's so terrifying about this "ghost"? It can't be appearance, since you describe it as a cartoonish "bed-sheet ghost." 




 No, but sometimes a dog is following me and I think I've dropped my keys 




 Imagining exercise might cue the body to think that exercising is immanent, cuing increased heart rate, etc., just like imagining food can cause salivation. But yeah, I'd like to see a source too. It seems like that would be too weak of an effect to result in any noticeable weight loss. I could see where an ill-controlled study that didn't monitor subjects' eating habits might see that effect - if you imagine exercise every night you might become more health-conscious and change your eating habits. 




 Agreed. Part of the problem is that "white" has always been defined negatively, that is, a "white" person was just someone who didn't fit into one of the more identifiable racial or ethnic groups. Might as well just call us "blank" people.

Another problem is that the "white" population in the US came from so many different European cultures that they really don't have that much of a common cultural background at all. Just like the Indian in the video who couldn't explain his culture as anything more than "dancing around a totem pole and stuff," what is "white" culture to the average American today, that is, culture that only "white" people can participate in and enjoy? NASCAR and Country Music? Hardly worth defending against some other culture or subculture that may be more appealing. 




 Depends when you date the beginning of the Civil War. 




 The U.S. and Canada got away with it.

And the British Empire. Read the book "The Victorian Holocaust." They killed more people in India alone than Hitler did in all the places he conquered. Of course, they had a lot longer to get the killing done. Mainly they used deliberate starvation like Stalin, but they weren't above gassing people either (Churchill suggested that the Kurds should be eliminated by gassing their villages- Saddam wasn't the one to think of that first.) 




 Quite eye-opening. The dialectic of White Nationalism eventually leads the thoughtful racist to sympathize with the Indians (!), and equate his own ancestors with today's globalists. 




 Google "Nazi Cultural Revolution." I think I'm remembering a proper book when it was just a review I read of "Werewolf!" plus some chat-board discussions.  

They're interesting nonetheless and would certainly make a great novel should someone choose to write one. Heck, I'll get us started:

Basically, Goebbels and the other surviving Nazis (with an ailing and increasingly demented Hitler in tow) carry out the "Alpine Redoubt" plan they were considering in 1945, and manage to spark a war between the US and the Soviets using false-flag attacks with the connivance of Patton and Churchill (both of whom considered an immediate attack on the Soviets in real life.) While the two former allies pummel each other, the Nazi Party is reconstructed along ultra-radical lines in rural Bavaria and Austria, paralleling Mao's Long March. The Party is toughened up, and (like Mao's forces), realizes that the total collapse of civilization is not enough to stop a determined group of radicals from seizing power. In fact, it rather helps things along.

Shadowy bankers from Switzerland cross the border into Nazi-held territory with gold and other resources for re-armament. Remnants of the Italian, Vichy French, and other fascists also make their way across the high passes of the Alps and join up with the Waffen SS. Ironically, the SS is now "multicultural" (this was happening to some degree in real life before the end of the war - they even had a Muslim battalion!). Some "adjustment" of racial views take place - success in battle is now evidence enough that you must have "Aryan" ancestry somewhere (Jews still need not apply, of course.)

In the chaos of the US-Soviet war, the Nazis manage to re-take a lot of their former territory and become a "Third Force" that neither the US or the Russians want to piss off for fear of putting the Nazis in the opposing camp. When peace finally arrives in late 1947 (Truman has threatened to nuke Moscow with his new long-range bombers), the Nazi regime is re-entrenched and there is no trust left among the former allies to take it down. Cynical politicians on both sides also see the advantage of a Central European "buffer state" between the American and Soviet Empires to keep border tensions down. The Holocaust is known about, but it is lost in the sea of the mass slaughter of an expanded and elongated World War II.

Hitler was already quite sick in 1945 and dies by 1950, succeeded by a triumvirate of Goering (who is also sickly and morbidly obese by this point), Bormann and Goebbels. Himmler defected to Sweden when all seemed lost in 1945 (his actual plan in real life) and is now a Trotsky-like figure. By the 1960's, the Reich has become a bizarre cross of Switzerland and North Korea, committed to neutrality but also ruled by a totalitarian political party which is armed to the teeth with some of the most advanced weaponry in the world.

By this point, Goebbels, always the master propagandist and politician, has pushed aside Bormann. Goering died in 1955, a 500-lb. monster, surrounded by harem girls and plundered art. Goebbels was always on the left-wing of the Party and wants to revive the "Socialist" in National Socialism. However, he faces strong opposition from conservative Christians and business interests who are now doing a booming trade with both the US and Soviet spheres. 

However, Goebbels has a potent weapon: A new generation of "Aryans," raised by the Hitler Youth and the "Lebensborn" movement. These cadres, now come of age, assail the conservatives and try to revive the dream of world conquest and the Master Race. They protest at Universities and party conventions, carrying their "little black books" - abridged copies of *Mein Kampf* of course. They occupy Albert Speer's grand buildings in Berlin and demand the downfall of the "bourgeois  Junkers" and the "foreign elements" within the Waffen SS. The rest of the world grows nervous that World War III is about to begin...

take it from there!

 




 I haven't read that but I did read "Young Stalin" by the same author. It actually prompted my question as it had a number of incidents of Stalin acting in a very reckless manner that could be suggestive of psychosis or clinical paranoia. 




 Yes, I think that's where I heard it too. Great show. 




 I've heard this story too. Apparently this happened back in Georgia. He was with some fellow Bolsheviks and he wanted to prove his toughness and mercilessness so he killed the animal (in the version I heard, he strangled it.) I'm not sure how much validity this story has or where I heard it. 




 Yes, I know he did a lot of that early on in his rule. I'm more thinking of later on, the Great Terror and later, all the people who died shouting "long live Stalin!" and actually meant it. Did Stalin think those people had secretly betrayed him (clinical paranoia), or was he killing people he knew to be loyal for some other reason? 




 Don't forget the "Blues," the supporters of the Provisional Government! 




 Interesting question. I may take heat for this, but there are a lot of similarities between Hitler's expansion towards the East and the genocide of the Native Americans in the US. Indeed Hitler thought of the two as similar and used that to morally justify his invasions. See the book *The Wages of Destruction* for a good discussion of this.

Science in Nazi Germany was highly politicized. Anyone who didn't get on the mythical "Aryan" bandwagon was sacked or worse. In a scenario where Hitler "won" the war - not necessarily conquer the world, just survive as a regime into the 1950's or 60's, I don't see this really changing.

Most people who have thought through "Alternate Histories" about a postwar Nazi regime see the main threat coming from even more radical Nazis - the pagan/mystical SS clashing with the more Christian "preserve traditional German values" crowd. There was a great book a while back, can't remember the title, that was set during a Nazi "Cultural Revolution" during the 60's where radical ultra-Aryan students "assaulted the party" for its conservatism under the direction of a new Fuhrer who took over after Hitler's death.

In short, no, I think the Nazi ideology was too extreme to ever moderate like the American "manifest destiny" ideology eventually did. Instead it would probably have turned inward on itself and collapsed in a series of purges and crazy attempts to resurrect Atlantis (Thule) or genetically engineer Aryan supermen or some such craziness. 



















 According to something I saw on TV, you can do this in Baltimore just by asking people to say the name of the city! Not sure how accurate or scientific this is however.

 Numbers like 24, 60 and 360 are useful because they have lots of factors. That is, there are lots of ways to subdivide them without remainder. That is one reason these numbers show up a lot in calculating everyday things like time and angle.

 Yes, there is a theory that the Big Bang is the result of a vacuum fluctuation in the "quantum foam" which exists because of the uncertainty principle. Now, what all that means, that's beyond me. I read it in Stephen Hawking's book.

 I watched Enter the Void and was bored stiff, gave it two stars on Netflix (for the interesting idea only, it got a star.)

 If you are considering math grad school, you will probably see plenty more of both. Are you more of an algebra/stats person or a geometry/physics person? 



















 I had this practice described to me though I haven't tried it myself. Basically, your read alternating chapters of works from opposing points of view (materialism vs. dualism, right-wing vs. left-wing politics, etc.). 

This supposedly avoids the effect of reading the books in sequence (first one and then the other) and being convinced either by the first or the last one you read, depending on your disposition.

Also you are supposed to see hidden connections, points of agreement or common flaws that the two arguments share. 









 Not for Central Banks, there it's the opposite.  









 I am more thinking, long-term, the team worst off in this new system is the one that shares a division with the Yankees. 









 Until very recently it was a good move as the pay is often a lot better. There is a "special needs" teacher at our district who is assigned to just a single student. The teacher's sole job is to follow this student around all day, and slap her hand back when she tries to touch things/people. Oh, and a bit of paperwork every 6 months. She makes more than twice the salary of a regular teacher.

However, if our state follows NY and some bureaucrat decides that this student needs to take the state standardized tests, this teacher is out of a job.  




 I go out of the way to use examples that involve pop culture, drugs, booze, speak the same way as my students

Advice from someone who's been on the job a bit longer than you have, perhaps: There is nothing more uncool than the "cool teacher." This does not earn you respect from the students.

 A friend of mine had a dream like this: She dreamed that a friend of hers - who had actually died in real life at 16 - appeared and told her she had been reborn as a baby in Italy, and gave the name of the town and the street address and everything.

Now I don't believe in reincarnation or anything, but I would have at least looked up that address when I woke up! My friend however, just wrote it off as a "weird dream" and never looked up the address. She said she remembered it for some time, but by the time she told me about the dream, she had forgotten everything about it except that it was somewhere in Italy. 




 Isn't this illegal in the US? I remember a similar site being shut down last year because "peer-to-peer" lending violated American banking regulations. Have they found a way around this? 



















 Very good explanation. Thanks! 




 Interesting, I am not really familiar with model theory. I am confused as to how if you only have the symbols 0,1,+,x,, how you can get anything other than whole numbers anyway. 

Even if you add Z to that list, I assume it is a Boolean function of some kind, telling you if a number is an integer or not? Wouldn't any number still come out to be an integer if you only have 0, 1,+ and * to work with to make other numbers? (I am assuming you mean "x" to be multiply, not a variable name.) 




 Thanks for the reply. I understood the first paragraph but kind of lost you in the second. I've been through Analysis but it's been a while. Maybe time to dust off the old notes...
