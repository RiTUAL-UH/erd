 do you game? if so, what are some of your favs? also a monster fan, love you dude. 


































 right in the feels 









 this is what happens when a pretty good-but not top school throws money to get the "best" in its company. if NYU wants to become the next Harvard (as J-sex's delusional puts it), it's going to have a tough time with PR nightmares like this 




 it is a great read. but of course if it's too long, just get a high res image of Bosch's "Garden of Earthly Delights" for basically the same content 




 The Inferno is just the first part of the Divine Comedy, which covers usury (obtaining wealth from a source other than natural resources or human activity) :) 









 hahahaha yes! 




 "And then there are Professor Connellys friendsa year before, Bill Murray spent a week digging and entertaining the troops. He was a great worker, Connelly gushes." http://www.departures.com/articles/cleopatras-secret  
























 I am an Econ major and it seems like everyone works for a start up at one point in their time at NYU. Big tech firms also like to recruit from NYU ( I will be at one upon graduation ). And getting an internship in NYC is like shooting fish in a barrel. 









 my b for the misinformation then! thanks for clearing it up 




 I think you need to be part of a women's CS society on campus but I remember reading this when I was a freshman.  




 I took 101 and it was a little hard but not crazy. As said before, he doesn't really teach. He's a cute guy though and you can definitely teach yourself all you need to know 




 it's one of the best in the country. if you graduate from it and are female, you are guaranteed an interview with Google, no lie. 




 maybe, but the number of "candid" pics of them is excessive. they're nice guys and all so maybe they don't care though 




 I'm convinced the zac and cody kids are behind it. It's a little TOO convenient that they're in every other post... 




 crocodile lounge gets you a free personal pizza with every drink 




 nailed it 
























 I can confirm this. She's a sweetheart and I'm glad the university was able to protect her privacy for the most part while she was there 




 haha good question. I wish I knew :(. I am skipping the ceremony either way. 




 that's so sad :( I hope it works out! in exchanges ya gotta pay it forward 









 Absolutely. There are multiple Pio Pio locations too. If you have a group, the Matador is a killer deal 




 I recently went there and it was delicious. The fresh sorbet is absolutely insane 




 This is the structure I encountered. Except that I took Latin American History with Jorge Castaneda which was pretty amazing. Those freshman seminars definitely pull in cool names / academic celebrities so take one while you can 




 it's set to private :( 




 it's largely been taken down but you can see bits of it in a video here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/01/tyler-the-creator-racist-mountain-dew-commercial-pepsico_n_3193650.html?ir=Black+Voices  




 I always felt this way. I'm sure it's just the changing editors and what not (who for the record publish in other NYC based publications, so they have some credibility). I remember reading 'Local my senior year of high school so maybe it's just my anticipation to live in NYC fading. I miss the hyper active comment section though... no one comments on the new articles with is a bummer
