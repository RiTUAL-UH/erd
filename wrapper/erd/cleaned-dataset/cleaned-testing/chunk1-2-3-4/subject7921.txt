 Love the boobs, and you're very pretty. 




 I have tried full face masks, but don't use them regularly.

Some of them go over the chin, some go to the little dip in your chin below the "base" of your lower teeth.  They should not sit on your teeth at all, if it does, then it's too small.

The only full face mask I have ever seen that "strapping it down super tight" makes it fit better is one that looks like a fireman's mask, has like a clear open visor goes all the way up above your eyebrows and down to that dip below your lower teeth on your chin.

To give you an example, often times I will measure small or medium in over the nose masks, but small usually ends up with it leaking if I move much in most masks.  So there's the possibility you could go medium or large and they picked medium and it just isn't big enough to cover your face sufficient when you move a little causing leaks.


Looking at your specific mask.  The top strap is going to change how much that upper piece flexes against your forehead...if it's flexing even a little it should be tight enough to hold the mask to your nose at the top.

The lower strap you need to adjust it when you lay back in your normal sleeping position because if you adjust it sitting upright it won't fit right at all once you lay down.   Just get it close, then lay down and readjust WITH THE MACHINE ON.

Then your mask should be JUST loose enough to pick the whole mask up slightly off your face and seat it again where you think it needs to be. 

Then reason you pick it up off your face and put it back down is so that the rolled in edges of the piece on your face aren't pinched or pushed out of the mask causing it to leak.  They need to be inside the mask and against your face to it forms a pocket of air pushing out on the silicon pad walls making it conform to your face.   You just need your straps to be tight enough so that it conforms but doesn't make "fart" or squeaking noises indicating it's too loose.

I think your mask might be too small.

And from my experience MOST cpap users don't use full face masks when they've had some options to try and find one they like....it's either a nasal pillow (in the nose) or a around the nose type mask.   Full faces are usually for people who can't keep their mouth closed (which is also a sign of your cpap not being treated well) or who have facial issues like slackness due to strokes.


If you're really set on getting a full face mask...try looking into the fire fighter looking mask..  which is infact called a TOTAL face mask.  

http://www.cpap.com/productpage/respironics-fitlife-total-full-face-cpap-mask-headgear.html

Can browse there for other ideas on stuff too, they have a pretty good selection.  A lot of doctor offices only carry one brand of masks or machines and kind of let you think it's your only options. 




 All of it sounds pretty normal for me.    I don't go out much at all anymore.  I make a whole lot of stuff into awkward dirty jokes and I'm allergic to bananas, they give me a itchy mouth which sounds stupid..but yeah.  Plus people look silly eating them.

In SW Ohio. 




 You should be able to run it off the car battery, but I would check into it as it could damage the units.  I know there were some people that came into a local support group talking about how they can no longer recommend a whole line of stuff for CPAPs due to issues and it voiding the warranties, etc.

They make special batteries for them, but they ALSO make little portable cpap units for using on flights and things that come with it's own battery unit that is pretty much small enough to like strap to your leg.  I forget the MFG.

For example, they were recommending marine batteries for cpaps due to how long they hold charge and put out power...now they no longer do that.    




 You = hot.

Let's hope you can't sleep more often?.....or something. 




 I do most of my book consumption video audiobooks.  And I find music to not add much to the experience and often detract from it.

I think they used to use it to make it easier to fastforward through cassettes and stuff where you could hear the sped up audio and it just kind of stuck.  

But.....unless you can prove it's really adding to the situation I'd avoid it.


Also, while it's not asked for.  Pronunciation is something that drives me crazy, even more so if they pronounce the same word differently since you don't have the text in front of you to check wtf they are trying to say.

Oh and characters with similar names, or names that start with similar sounds start to get rather confusing to me when there's a lot of dialog.
 




 I like what I've seen so far.  More requested. 




 1) If there is a shortage, these tradesman schools should have companies PAYING people's way through the school to get a standardized education they can build off of.

1b)  Companies are not doing this because they are purposefully driving wages down and using any and all excuses they can to do it.

2) Companies are looking at eminent failure if they don't have the people they need to do the work.

2b)  Again, they are outsourcing it and using any and all excuses to do so.  It's just a flat out lie.

3) You can't expect people to work at Walmart pay and also tell them that there should be dignity in their work.

3b)  Paying people minimum wage just reinforces that the job is not "skilled" or "desirable".  Which is another way they are driving the jobs to foreign labor and outsourcing when they can.



The only time this is going to change is when these companies keep assuming that the labor they find elsewhere is what they would get at the 80k+ range in the US...and it blows up in their face.   Then I hope workers who have been putting up with shit pay for the same work rake them over the coals nice and good to demonstrate how each and every other company out there doing this crap will suffer a similar fate come their "turning point".


College education requirement stuff is heading the same way.  It's like the exact opposite of Henry Ford's strategy.  Paying people enough so they can buy what they make....has turned into keeping prices the same and making more per unit while the people buying them make effectively less and less each year.  GENIUS!
 




 How long would you say this took?   If you don't mind saying.
 




 Ah only on the second part of the study then.  6cm is I THINK below the threshold.  I believe they told me a 7cm is like "normal" breathing pressure...but I could be wrong it's been awhile since I've been on anything under 10cm.  I actually went from a 14 to a 10cm recently due to medication changes...so always keep this in mind that medication CAN change your pressure if you suddenly get worse.  Drinking will too, I don't drink...but drinking is something they warn a lot against.


I think I've been on Cpap since.....2007ish.  And I've had 3 titration testings, the original and two re-titrates.  1 was due to a machine failure and wanting to make sure the pressure wasn't off, and the other was recently for medication changes and feeling like crap...got a new machine since it had been over 5 years.


My first titration was horrible, granted they were in a hospital building and I could hear things going down the hall and lots of external lights.  They moved to a new more separate location with more "bedroom" type designs and better light blockage etc.  But I had figured out what bugged me most about the room, was that it was too quiet.  I use an air filter at home and it's just generally noisier in the room I sleep in, and the quiet was just unnerving.  To combat the quiet they were able to get a box fan and place it in the room with me to create some noise.  The wires suck too, but it's better to just be cautious but sleep how you wanna sleep and wires be damned to be honest...because if you can't get to sleep..they aren't going to get any meaningful readings.  Oh they also had some sleep number beds, which were kinda fun to play with...much better than "hospital bed" beds.  

To get heated hoses you need a machine that supports it OR you can get one that is a third party hose and has a separate power brick to heat the hose..  My friend has one of the third party hoses and likes it, so either will work, but the built into the machine hose makes it use water a lot more efficiently which is just such a big difference for me.

AND this just came to me.  The newest machine offerings on CPAPs can be put into a "auto mode" where it will evaluate for itself what kind of pressure you need to some degree.  So they can send you home with the machine and it will try to figure out your needed pressure too so they have another source of information to pool from if the over night stays don't work out.  I don't know how much they use this, but I insisted they do it for me because I didn't believe I went from a 14cm to 10cm given that i had gained weight...and everything pretty much agreed.

Still want a longer heated hose....if any of you CPAP MFGs are reading this....10 foot heated hoses!  




 Have you tried sleeping without a pillow?  You might be holding your head differently because of the mask.  Ive found a lot of pillows to be rather uncomfortable with the masks and make me have to lay oddly causing neck pain, etc.

Also your mask shouldn't be too tight, they recommend allowing two fingers between the strap and face easily for "tightness" on most.

I know my back would hurt on CPAP because I wouldn't lay naturally with the mask on due to the tubing and everything else and being afraid of pulling the machine off the table for quite awhile.  The hose management thing took away the fear of pulling the machine off since it would have taken extreme force to do it. 




 Look at buying a hose management device if you can't move in bed without your mask coming off.  Cpap.com has some examples....I bought the "Hoser" or something like that.  Stopped having to wrestle the mask every time I moved.  Most I had to do was spin the connection on it to take pressure off the side that was pulling and move it to over my head or just unbind it where it got caught.    You may need a longer hose...which currently heated hoses are only 6 foot and people need to bug the hell out of them to make 8 and 10 foot ones so you can use management systems more easily.
 




 Have been on CPAP for a number of years, go to regular support group sessions a local sleep center offers.   I would recommend seeing if a support group exists because the people there will have ideas and recommendations most doctors won't even consider for comfort.

1) You can analyze the data yourself.  I have no experience with it but some of the companies even had bluetooth enabled things you can plug into the machine.

2) I don't use a UPS, but you need to make sure it doesnt beep when the power fails because that'll drive you crazy.  One bad night is not the end of the world, but going on three and you'll want to murder your power company.

3)  Once it's successfully treated:  You find a mask you like, you use it all night, and you've visited your doctor for a follow up visit after using it for a month....you SHOULD have knocked out daytime sleepiness.  

Hypertension may be alleviated some, but generally I found that if you are on meds you will stay on meds to deal with it unless you lose weight or find some other cause.  

Teeth grinding, it did absolutely nothing for me in stopping this.  In fact they seem almost to ignore it completely as a symptom of sleep apnea unless you notice it increasing/getting worse.  Some people recommend taking your mask to your dentist if you are getting fitted for any appliances because it can cause discomfort and stuff lines up a little different.

Morning headaches SHOULD be gone.  They were for me.  Although Ill wake up with a headache now and then depending on the weather, allergies, etc.

Feeling like crap......you should notice a marked difference a month in.  And it should only get better once you get more used to the machine.


My biggest beef with CPAPs in the current generation is that their heated hoses are too damn short.  A 6 foot hose is just long enough to get hung on everything but not long enough to elevated up off the bed and allow for tossing and turning.  I bought a hose management thing that works kind of like a fishing reel for my old machine and it made a HUMONGOUS difference in how much I had to futz with the mask in the night and uncoil myself.  Made for a much more sound sleep where I could just roll over and not wake up enough to remember.  So if by chance they do have a longer than 6 foot heated hose, GET IT is my recommendation.


The new machines are WAY better on water usage with their new humidifier designs and heated hoses....so you aren't draining the tank empty in dry dies and waking up with a dried out nose or crazy dry mouth.  If you're opening your mouth while sleeping, it's probably because of lack of humidity on CPAP.

Also build up a small collection of different masks.  Sometimes heavier masks are more comfortable in winter....or sometimes you'll get a pimple or ingrown hair and a different style mask will give it time to heal.

They also make sleeves for the hose, which kind of did the same thing as the heating on hoses does now.  But it also keeps you from touching cold hard plastic at night that might be distracting.

And use DISTILLED WATER in your humidifier, anything else builds up gunk on the bottom of your humidifier and causes you to inhale water that has a "smell" to it when it becomes gaseous and might irritate you.  It's cheap and now that they use so little water a gallon lasts me nearly 2 months so far, and saves you from having to use vinegar to break up the build up every few months.  

If you wake up with dried out eyes, it's a sign that your mask may be leaking by your nose.  Sometimes it can't be helped if you really like a certain style mask...and wearing a sleeping mask will keep it from really bothering you if you can't adjust it to stop it.
 




 What do you hope to do once you graduate as a chemistry student? 




 What kind of games do you develop? 




 I don't know about passion, but I enjoy fantasy fiction and some sci-fi books.  I usually listen to the audiobook versions if I can get my hands on them.   More of a thinker and a reader than a go out and do kind of person. 




 Just as a random thread I picked to read, you might want to take a moment to put some info about your book in the post when do giveaways.  Might generate some buys even if they don't win.   I know you included links, but never hurts to put a little more info in the post to catch eyes......maybe? 




 Sure, sounds like it could be informative.  Always wondered how much an impact the "test" readers had on the process. 




 What is expected of beta readers?

I do not believe I have read Hollow World or Riyria, but I have been known to confuse authors and book titles. 




 I like the coy smile. 




 Yep.  They also do this same thing with fake checks.  Chances are the "carrier company" is bogus as well.

Few things to look for obvious form letter responses.  Never mentions the  vehicle/item in question.  Can't name the carrier company or you can't find it when looking it up.

Easy test is to respond and mention a completely different car make/model and jack up the price a bunch to cover possible "fees" paypal, etc might have.  If he doesn't care, then scam....who cares what you get if it's free.
 




 Anything boob related.  Sucking them, nipple clips, titfucking.    Oh and spanking, enough to leave a good red hand print....on her. 




 Hello, I'll give it a shot 35M.  Lurker on Reddit, made the account today. 
























 Since you didn't use insurance to get your equipment...you should be able to get insurance to cover a machine in the future.   Usually it's about 5 years between machines unless it breaks and is unrepairable.


Just something to keep in mind if you are going to have some major procedure done some year....and the current machine is getting old.   

I keep my old machine just incase the new one dies for whatever reason, because I'm going to bet they won't give me a temporary machine to tide me and I'll be damned if Im gonna suffer needlessly.
 




 They can tell when you're awake and asleep...you're rate of breathing changes.

But if you wear it and can't fall asleep...or take it off after however many hours.  As long as you are ATTEMPTING to comply, they can't hold it against you.  It's their job to figure out why you're not able to comply....maybe the pressure is wrong.  Maybe you need a different style mask...

You can always call your doctors office and ask about it and see what they expect you to do...give it 30 days of trying then make changes...or change it after a week...etc


I know most of them will replace the mask however often in the first 30 days.
 




 Sounds like they are charging insurance rates on your stuff.  If you got a 1k deductible and could wait until the new year, I'd let insurance cover it then your deductible will be taken care of the rest of next year.  Although I really don't advise waiting on something affecting your sleep...just it's always good to try to put big medical stuff at the beginning of the year so the deductibles are knocked out.
 




 Wonderful, Im a big boob fan, so post post post. 




 Lovely. 




 Yeah I've been unemployed for some time now...talking 5ish years.  Gained a bunch of weight.  It ain't improving, that's for sure.    It's pretty soul crushing to be stuck like this, and I don't see how it be explained to anyone in a way that doesn't make me sound neurotic.  So that job hunt is only going to get worse.


Hell typing it out like this just makes it seem that much more hopeless.  Since your job = you.....to A LOT of people. 




 Free Zunes to all who reply? Woohoo. 




 You're very much describing my situation.  Except I am older and not "attractive".  Got friends with wives and kids, others who go out to sporting events, bars...etc.  I get anxiety from hell just going to the grocery store or a doctor's appointment.  I feel stupid about it after the fact, but it literally makes me sleep less for days before hand due to the anxiety and Im lucky if I can fall asleep at all the night before if I know something/anything is happening the next day.  And it is definitely not excitement, it's deep down dread.

If I have to go to an job interview......now that is where I feel like I am completely unprepared no matter what I try to do before hand.  And it's because I am socially inept.  The work of the job doesn't bother me, the interaction, small talk, dressing like others, eating amongst others, etc......horrible.

Plus I really hate trying to deceive/mislead people to make myself sound more confident/normal.  So that definitely does not go well in interviews, since experience tells me most people just want people to say they can do anything asked of them right away.

Have been referred to a therapist recently.  I dread that as well, because I feel like everything I try anymore is just a complete waste of effort/time. 




 No you are wearing it right when it fits good while laying down and doesn't fit when sitting up.  Gravity, relaxation of face, angle of neck all make the mask fit differently when laying down.  It should be very loose when sitting up most due to tilt of your head/neck. 




 I don't use ramp.......

Anytime my pressure changed +/-3 and I have issues with it either being too much pressure and trying to breathe against it when it goes up.  Or being the lower pressure and feeling like Im trying to suck the air in and the machine isn't providing it.

It takes a little time to get used to the change, and I find the ramp function just makes it more complicated.  

PLUS most machines anymore have some sort of reduce pressure breath-back system, which I forget the name of.  When you breathe out it senses it and cuts the pressure.  So when you breathe it, it goes back up.  So it gets really low if you're using ramp.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This part of the machine is all I need, there are some models that didn't have it in the past.  I dont know about now because I can't remember what it's called.  But it keeps you from feeling like you have to breathe super slow all the time just to not be suffocated by the pressure IMO. 




 You've got excellent boobs.   




 I can't comment on all of the results as I am not familiar with the baselines and scoring on them exactly.  But I am commenting to let you know that they have take home tests to see if you are a candidate for a more thorough test (the one you've already done).  

If they are willing, you may get some kind of evidence to prove it's an issue when in more "comfortable" surroundings.


Also, they have the ability to send you home with apnea machines that can do some monitoring and evaluation of events themselves.  I know some of the manufacturers have set people up with temporary machines when the tests weren't quite conclusive enough. 




 For how much better you feel it's not much of a trade off.  Most annoying part is keeping the machine clean.  Since after awhile you get used to it and kinda forget it's there.

I haven't traveled with it, but that would be the most annoying point by far.  Counts as a medical device, so you can carry it on...but then you know how inspections and stuff can go wrong.

If I was going to do a lot of flying with a cpap...I'd have to figure out a way to have one run off battery while flying so I could sleep.  Ain't even worth my time now to try to sleep without it, better off just staying awake for all the rest I get out of it. 




 What do you do now that is not enough?   




 Saw this and went through many more of your posts.  Thanks for them all......very hot. 




 If you said you snore, I'd say probably yes.  But there are other types of sleep disorders that I am not as familiar with.  Central apnea being one.  My brother has it, he breathes like he's whining at times without the machine and he often refuses to use it.

I have sleep apnea and I'll sleep 10-12 hours sometimes....some people just need more sleep.

You also don't say how old you are.  If you're potentially still growing, late teens or early 20s you might sleep more.  Or if you're in a place where you have potentially allergies going on, you'll sleep more since it's like being sick with your body reacting to the allergens all day long.   




 Boobs and smooth nice looking skin everywhere else.   If someone sent me that picture, I'd wanna see more.  I love boobs. 




 Headaches throughout most of the day were what got me tested for sleep apnea.  I'd feel kinda OK after waking up, and then have a craptacular headache the rest of the day until maybe 5-6 PM.  It got so bad that eventually I was avoiding sleep because I'd feel so much worse after sleeping compared to when I went to bed.

Thyroid can alter your apnea pressure ( I just found this out recently), and thyroid conditions ran in the family...so if you're in the same boat they will want to keep an eye on it.  PLUS there's the chance that while you're "in the range" you might be right on the cusp of the range and it may be effecting you.  Just talk to your doctor about it and make sure they are considering that your "normal" need might be different than the "average" normal.
 




 Meds won't help with apnea, and in fact will probably make it worse if it causes you to relax more.  Because alcohol makes apnea worse for the same reasons.

Sleeping on your side can SOMETIMES help.

You should get treated because untreated apneas have long term health problems for your heart, blood pressure, etc due to your BP spiking each and everytime you "choke" and then dropping when you wake, and repeating all night long whether you remember waking up or not.


They used to treat apnea prior to the machines by giving people tracheotomies.  Which is basically cutting a hole in your neck and letting you breath through that hole to avoid the potential blockage area altogether.  

Weight loss can help alleviate sleep apnea, but it will probably return with age due to slackening of skin/muscles. 




 Shouldn't hurt your readings if you have just plain obstructive apnea and not central apnea.  Some of the central apnea machines have tests for the masks that need to be ran to see if they will work with the machine.

These are usually easy to tell by having a little "oxygen" like tube running along side the air tube for the machine.   




 Keep using it.

They say to make a schedule and stick to it.  Personally I find myself super anxious about alarm clocks and tend to want to wake up before them...sometimes WAAAAAY before them and then get anxious about sleeping through it if I try to fall back asleep.

And I know it'll suck at first.  But I cut pretty much all caffeine out, so when you do "need something" you get more out of it.  I used to drink a lot of pop/soda and...it was very hard to give it up.   But you don't feel like you need it so much after awhile.


Keep using the machine for one.  But I also found that when I got into like...a pre-sleep routine I would fall asleep quicker.  Listening to an audiobook while I brush my teeth and fill up up the humidifier.  Then lay down and put the mask on, get comfortable and listen to the book until I get really drowsy and turn off the book and pass out.  USUALLY works.


Oh, and if you find that you're waking up a lot when you sleep or tossing and turning (usually a sign you're waking up and not remembering) try adjusting your humidifier up or down one the next night and see if you think you slept better.   The warm air is kind of stifling when you're trying to sleep, but it keeps you more comfortable once you're asleep.

I don't know what Nuvigil is......  you may look into the possibility that you're just not eating enough or the "RIGHT" kind of stuff to give you the energy you need to make it through the day.  Maybe try beefing up breakfast with eggs or sausages and eat a little more meat and veg for lunch.  I know if I eat a lot of bread or sweet stuff I feel like Im crashing later and it comes on as feeling tired and drowsy sometimes.
 




 While you have great tits, I think your hair and especially your lips are really quite spectacular.

For requests....I'd like to see you smile (show teeth)!

And a profile picture showing off booty and boobs. 

Arms above head pic.  And on all fours pic.  Both showing off the lips and boobs.

Oh and nipple clips, if you're into that.
 




 Neti Pot or if that's too much of a pain.  There's some sprays you can buy that work similarly to a neti pot and can get them in various types to help get your nose open so you can get the mask on and blowing.

Usually once I can get my nose open and the mask on I don't stuff up again until I take it off. 
























 Spank bank material. 




 Yep. 




 If they know they exist, like you're not banking overseas or in some strange location....once they have a death certificate they can pretty much get any information they want.  Went through this when my grandmother died and the crazy aunt started getting into things, she got access to the stuff faster than my parents did, even though my parents were handling my grandmothers finances at the end.

They are SUPPOSED to follow the directions of any will you might leave, so that might be a better idea to get sorted out. 




 Recently turned 36.  For years now I can't even picture a future where I think I'd be happy.  I can easily picture worse things to come.  When I go into a job interview and they ask me what Im passionate about, I have to try to make something up and try not to laugh at the absurdity of the question.

Lately I've been thinking about just giving away everything I own (not a whole lot) and just walking away from life.  I kind of think it's a fancy way of saying kill myself, but I don't know........there's some CHANCE there once everything else is gone maybe.  

Or that I need something horrible to happen to me, to give me a reason to feel bad that makes sense to other people.  If you're just a worthless lump trying to slowly climb your way out of the dark pit by getting a job, trying to find someone who likes you, etc....it's pretty hard to describe to normal thinking individuals why you haven't been working on your skills or whatever else.  Plus I would find it hard to trust someone whose mind is essentially betraying them if I were hiring a depressed individual like myself.

That there is when I start wondering what the point in continuing is, because I feel like I bring misery to everyone around me plus myself often enough that suicide might be tough...but they could move on and I could be done if I could just convince myself and pay for the costs associated with it somehow.  Some kind of terminal illness would solve it.
 




 I am interested in what you have to say and would like to subscribe to your newsletter.
 




 Fresco, looks like a Fresco to me. 




 They only care if you average X number of hours a night as far as I know.  I used to have a lot of days where I stayed up over 24 hours so I never used the machine on those days.

I wouldn't worry about it too much.  People get sick, if you dont have alternative masks to use and can't breathe through your nose..ain't much to be done about it.

BUT, if you run into the nose issues in the future, my experience is using some kind of saline spray or neti pot to get your nose open and then turn your humidifier up to see if it helps..if it's worse then turn it down to try to dry you out.  Usually turning it up is the solution to most of my nose inflammation issues. 




 Alcohol affects your sleep, makes your apnea worse.  Chances are certain pain medications will do the same thing.

They say 15 pounds requires a re-titrate for your apnea....

But if you have apnea caused by your brain, unless the pain medicine is causing it as a side effect...I don't see you being able to stop using the machine.

Different masks can make a big difference, but you might also need to get another test if it's been awhile.

I know I had a thyroid condition and diabetes that got treated and it drastically changed my apnea pressure levels, and I felt like shit prior to getting everything addressed.  Might be something else happening. 




 Everquest 2 was a decent looking game, I was in the beta...it played pitifully for me.  Maybe debugging, maybe hardware...been long enough I dont really remember what I had at the time.

But I was really disappointed the game was called Everquest considering how different it was.  I came in with an expectation and it was like everything got thrown out the window.  To this day when I go back to try it.......I still really don't see the similarities.  And find it to be rather odd and clunky to play considering it's the "more modern" version of Everquest compared to other MMOs of it's time.

It kind of goes to a line of thinking, that if they had just themed it anyway else and called it something else I probably wouldn't have been so hard on it.

Same with SWG, it has some really unique systems and such but never really felt "Star Warsy".  If it didn't have to measure up to Star Wars, it would have been a pretty unique and fun to play game that would probably have lasted longer.

Which was one of the points SOE said they were addressing by only using their own IP going forward........but they really didn't cut down on the hype and overpromising that pissed me off so much.  You buy in thinking, well it's good enough NOW...but when they get XYZ it's going to be awesome.  And then you finally realize they duped you again.  Eventually you have to stop rewarding that behavior and call them on the BS.   

And considering they are one of the few, if not the only MMO development house that could potentially run smaller MMOs with unique systems that would appeal to the "tired of the same old" former/less enthusiastic MMO players now it just.........wears on me to see them continuing to abuse those players instead of trying to cater to them.
 




 Star Wars Galaxies.....there's a CHANCE that LucasArts killed that game.  I've always heard they insisted on NGE.  

Matrix Online.....bought from a failed run.

Vanguard.....that got McQuaided.

But the ones I mentioned, those are entirely SOE driven.  So their comments and promises are within their control. 




 While I don't care about H1Z1, since the announcement is mostly here......

I'd just like to point out that SOE announcements have a history of basically blowing smoke up your ass by using language that is very non-specific.  Current path of development and operation could be that they were PLANNING on more micro transactions and it was unannounced yet.

Get some hard promises out of them with specific language so it's not 6 months down the road and you're 100-200 dollars in when you find out they don't intend to honor what you THOUGHT they meant.


Planetside 2 has basically rotted on the vine versus what Smedley was spit balling the game could turn into.  It has lost so many players because of the lack of progress..... buying the same weapon half a dozen times is .......just silly.  And the whole MLG bend, waste of time as it just doesn't appeal to a mass audience.  They never added resource collection or anything that doesn't focus around the FPS aspect despite loads of comments on it, etc.

Planetside 1 last time I played had people obviously cheating, using vehicle immunity hacks or hacks to take the spread out of their weapon shots for pinpoint firing while holding down the trigger.

I'd bring up Everquest, but since it was new and people didn't know what they could expect...I can forgive some BSing there.

Then it continued with Everquest 2......all that voice work that no one wanted and a complete redesign of the Everquest world and classes that was like a game with Everquest name tacked onto it.

Landmark, while interesting for building, just lacks the basic "life"/spark of minecraft.

Haven't heard much of anything about Everquest Next in a long time....so you have no idea what they plan on doing with it.

Only person worse for bullshitting people is McQuaid. 




 Just curious if you would elaborate on the field of information security.  Day to day stuff you might do, etc.  I see it listed fairly often in federal job listings. 




 If you have a cold/allergies sometimes I'll think it's my CPAP for a bit.

Otherwise.....not using the humidifier gets me sinus issues which comes off as a headache at times.

Usually when I had headaches due to lack of untreated sleep apnea, it was above my ears and high on my head on the sides.

If you can tap your forehead and around your eyes and it hurts, that's sinus pressure from something. 




 I think it's only federal positions allowed to post there.  And most of those spend the year on hiring freezes with little spats of unfrozen time to hire.  So they have A LOT of applications to choose from when the time comes to pick.


But to give you some idea of generally how a lot of government hiring goes.  Boss A hires Friend A, B, C, then and hires Stranger D, E, F.  Those friends are going to be put in any and all promotions Boss A has any say over.  And if Boss A moves up and out of the area, Friend replacing Boss A ends up acting just like him and hiring Friends to pass through the system as quickly as possible.  While everyone else not considered a friend can sit and spin unless they are willing to raise holy hell with the anti-discrimination guys to get people looking more closely at the nepotism going on.



Basically, I'm saying if you've worked in the real world only "private sector or way less fucked up public sector", you're going to be really pissed to see how it operates in federal positions unless you are working at the higher pay grades.


Although if you're bent on getting in, some of the bases use outside companies to do on-base work...and it's a good way to get the basic clearances and a leg up on outside of the system applicants. 




 You have some beautiful tits. 




 I've ordered stuff from Cpap.com without issue.  I don't know if they are the best on prices, but they had a decent selection. 




 Right, but you don't own the thing yet.  So he has no way of knowing what it will be like.

Like I said...they make A LOT of masks and products to make it more tolerable to partners.  And to be honest if you snore, I really doubt the rhythmic sounds of the machine are going to be MORE annoying than random gasps and gurgles during the night as you toss and turn during apnea events.

If it's SEEING you in it, then that's one thing.

If it's the NOISE, I doubt it will be a problem for long.

If it's something else, you need to figure it out.

End up with heart problems later in life if you dont get apnea taken care of due to the blood pressure spikes all night long.

Surgery is not very effective, and operations on your mouth are really quite painful to endure for not getting real nearly sure-fire results.


Unless there's some other weird reason, it sounds like he's just over-reacting to it.
 




 Unless you are sleeping in a room that is crypt quiet, people usually dont notice the machine running.  And if they do, they just put it above or below the level of their head to block the little bit of sound it makes.


If the mask is noisy, they make a lot of masks now that are made to diffuse air better.  Or come with cotton filters to cut down on the noise.

Get the machine, use it and see how much better you feel.  Then figure out the sleep arrangement....there's a lot of options to be had to make it more tolerable.  

Or just get to feeling so bad that you bitch at him all the time due to it.  Have noticed in quite a few people how much more tolerant they are once they've been on CPAP awhile. 




 As long as the dawn is anti-bacterial it's fine.  I use orange scented.

Don't soak your hose if it's heated.  Just put a drop in the non-connector end.  And stick your finger in the connector end to block the water and swish it back and forth.  Dump and repeat to get the majority of the soap out..

To me, the hose is the hardest part to wash and dry because of how it's made.  

Just try to get in the habit of doing it once a week, if you miss it's not the end of the world.  




 Really not much to screw up about it.  Just take the cloth part off your mask...and if you have a heated hose....you need to take care not to get the connector end wet.

Soak in dawn dish soap for the rest and rinse it off, wipe down with a dry cloth.  Done.

Most the masks are two parts, and the water chambers are two parts...

The filters can go longer..but they are super easy to clean (white ones you throw away when they start showing signs of build up and replace with new, black ones can be washed).
 




 They recommend to clean it each day, dumping any remaining water.  However if I have a significant amount of water left I let it go another night then dump it.

Mostly because some nights Ill barely use any water...and others Ill use a lot due to weather and humidity changes.  But I just hate dumping out a near full tank.   If you clean it regularly each week....and you're not letting it sit over 48 hours...   

Shrug.  Can really go crazy cleaning this stuff if you feel the need.  But I think my way strikes a decent balance for me.
 




 Little late to respond.  But I have asthma, and when I was first put on CPAP.....6-7 years ago.  It was really hard for me to relax on it and I felt like I had to breathe faster.

Most machines back down pressure when you exhale, which is a tremendous help.  So make sure that setting is on for sure.   

Then you need to get used to slowing down your breathing so it doesn't feel as suffocating.  I started taking really long in and out breathes like your doctor asks you to do when they listen to your lungs to exaggerate it...and you can feel how much easier it is to breathe on the machine when you do that.

Annnnnnnd while I've been on CPAP, I was put on Asmanex (inhaled steroid) which has virtually stopped my need for rescue inhalers.  Every so often I'll need the rescue inhaler when the allergies really start kicking in.  But generally I take the steroid inhaler maybe once a day or once every two days depending on the weather and how I'm feeling.  I think I can go up to like 2, maybe even 4 times a day according to my doc.  But really haven't felt the need.


Ever since they took the CFCs out of the asthma inhalers, I've felt like the rescue inhalers don't work as well.  They don't puff as hard, so when you're really struggling for breath you need to hit the thing 3-4 times to get what 2 puffs on the old CFCs used to do for me.  But that's one of those hard to judge things since Im older, etc.    I put that out there because I never have felt like the rescue inhalers really cut it for me for quite awhile, so something to consider if you're in the same boat. 




 Distilled water gallon jug is about a buck a gallon and lasts me over a month per bottle with my new heated hose-humidifier machine. It's WAAAAY more efficient on water than my older machine.

They recommend not using tap water because it can smell due to the chemicals used in it.  And can affect your lungs if you're sensitive to them.

Vinegar will remove build up in the water chamber if you don't use distilled.....maybe do this once a month.

And you should clean the parts of your machine weekly (mask, chamber, washable filter (black one), tube).  I usually soak my mask and chamber in dawn dish soap in as hot of water as you can manage.  

The tube if it's heated can't be submerged on the plugin side, so you put a drop in and plug off the plugin side with your finger and fill it from the other end a couple times.

And washable filter, I just rinse it under the sink...mostly to get any dust trapped in it out.

You can rinse your water chamber daily with a drop of dish soap if you are really concerned about germs, etc.   
























 Exposure therapy. 




 Cheaper oil

Some places suck the oil out of the fill hole instead of draining it out of the drain hole of the pan.  Which means any metal shavings in the vehicle will either be left in the oil pan or pulled up through the motor and not drained.

 




 You gasp, snort, snore, or whatever other noise once your airway becomes obstructed and you wake up enough to open it back up.

Deviated septum is going to give you less options on masks to treat your apnea, since most of the nose ones probably won't give you enough air passage to be comfortable.

Tonsils removed may make a difference, they have surgeries where they basically scar your throat to make it less likely to droop and obstruct your airway.  I dont know what the surgery is called off the top of my head.  So tonsil removal MIGHT have some aspect of that surgery included in it, you might even ask if they could do both.

Friend of mine had his tonsils out, it didn't do away with his apnea and need for the machine.  Another had his deviated septum fixed and it cured up a lot his allergy problems, but he didn't have apnea to begin with.    Apnea is typically an obstruction in your throat once you fall asleep your skin basically droops and forms like a little suction/vacuum there that your brain interprets as suffocating and wakes you up which causes the muscles and tissue to firm back up and you gasp/snore/clear your throat/whatever weird animal grunting noise you make.
 




 Oh and all masks have "weaknesses" besides fit.  Some the cushions wear out super fast.  With the entire face mask, the headstraps lose their ability to hold on the "loop" side of the velcro and it's a mask you gotta put on kinda tight to make it flex to fit your face on some people.
 




 I will say that from my support groups, most people dont tolerate nasal pillows beyond like a 12-15 pressure.  It's too much air being forced into your nose and nasal passages and really dries you out.  Very few people beyond a 15 can use them, very very very few.  Even the people who sell them dont suggest them at high pressures.  

If you're at that high of pressure, I might even question some of the around the nose masks.  My brother has low pressure, but he uses what I'd call an entire face mask.  It basically covers from above your eyebrows down to just above your chin.  It allows your body heat to help keep the air warm due to all the surface area on your face and doesn't feel like you've got cold air behind forced up your nose...and helps with eye irritation since if it leaks you're not having it blow into your eyes like on nearly every other mask.

I can't recall the name of it right now, but I think respironics or resmed makes it.  It has the inlet tube on the side for central sleep apnea machines.  Im not sure if the bipap needs to use that tube or not.  

I personally use around the nose masks....I've tried the entire face mask a few times, but could never get comfortable with it sleeping on my side.  If you're a back sleeper it should be pretty awesome.


 




 I see now.

But since Im here and something else I remembered came up.

Having untreated sleep apnea can cause high blood pressure and over time can cause circulatory system issues.  You're basically suffocating, your brain responds by going into fight or flight and wakes up you, gives you little BP spikes all night and little spurts of adrenaline potentially.  So your veins eventually begin to harden prematurely because it's like you spend all your nights in near constant "fight or flight" and you're body is not meant for that.

That is how it was explained to me in a cpap support group.


That might be what your doctor is getting at, I'd just ask him to explain what's up.  Some of the CPAP clinics are not very good about supporting their patients, they just shove hardware in your hand and often times dont even teach you how to adjust it properly for good fit.
 




 You're 37 now, tried it at 18.  So that's nearly 20 years.  The machines improve alot in just 5 years...so you probably had something more akin to a vacuum cleaner than a current day cpap back then.   That's how they made the first cpap machines, reversed vacuum cleaner motors.

Heated tube helps prevent rain out, where drops form in the mask and tube and then drip on your face or collect in the tube and gurgle causing pressure loss.

Or you can get tube wraps that help insulate it as a cheaper solution.

Dry mouth is opening mouth, or humidity.......I USUALLY set my humidity about 3 and do fine until it's freezing cold in the winter then I need to crank it up to 5 and then run out of water during the night.  So if you are running out of water the humidifier won't do a whole lot....if your tank is empty in the morning it could explain dry mouth and there isn't a lot you can do about it if you are filling your tank to the fill line.
 




 I would have never guessed how to pronounce "Sloughing", saw it in books, etc..  But never registered the way it sounds when someone says it with the actual word for quite awhile.  Which it's pronounced something like "Sluffing".


And seeing on diet websites, the word "Satiety", I expect more letters for how it sounds or something.
 




 Nope, I feel like nice clothes never fit me comfortably and I feel out of place wearing them.  But Im fat so......that's part of it. 




 I can relate, Im 36 years old.  Although I will add one big factor of it is feeling alone/lonely.  People really don't want to hear about your shit, or you perceive they don't want to hear about your shit.  If the off chance you do find someone to kind of unload on, and it feels better, they will start feeling the same way too and then either have to get away from you or end up like you.  Then you drop to an even lower level of "why the fuck bother"ness.

Told my parents about my feelings less than a handful of times and I could tell they didn't get it or thought even less of me for it.  So I don't do that anymore.  I really can't say that I believe my therapist understands that deep self loathing, apathy, and loneliness that comes along with everything else.  

My best description of mine would be that the universe/fate/god/whatever will make anything I attempt to do fail or turn out worse for me.  As has historically been the case.  So why would I want to tempt that "force" and try to be "better" when I know Im just going to end up worse off.

I'm really tempted to put a "deadline" on my life, get fixed or get dead by age X.  I told myself for years and years I would die/kill myself by 35.  Here I am 36 and any little bit of happiness I have ends up leaving or being taken away. 

The whole "behaviorism" aspect of psychology is ....... really the wrong way to approach people who have similar thinking to me.  Because I am an convinced that my behavior is in defense of my life being even worse and that's the only thing that can come of trying.  And behaviorism tries to teach you that your behavior is not working, so you should change type...basically.  It's just complete opposite IMO, you're basically trying to convince an atheist to become religious or vice versa with words.
 




 Welp I'd be interested in talkin if ya want. 




 Yeah I used to read, but started doing more audiobooks since I find I can do some mundane tasks with the book going.  So I always wonder how you really review an audiobook to be useful for improvement....I can see a few parts.

- Same reader throughout a series, doesn't matter if they aren't the most popular.  Switching them up is just annoying unless you've found some kind of magical replacement that improves on everything and still keeps the pronunciations and things the same.

- Pronunciations, bugs me sometimes.

- A lot of characters with names that start with the same sounds.  Stephen, Stephanie...lots of S names and it starts to become really hard to track whose talking unless the guy reading does some killer voice work.

Can probably think of more, but just kind of giving some idea of there being aspects JUST for the audiobook and then things that make the story muddy that can be brought into the audiobook that the text might not give the reader....S names, weird pronunciations of what you THOUGHT it sounded like.

James Marsden on the Dresden Files audiobooks does some awesome work, I think he enhances the story so much more with how he does the reading.  Then one book they didnt use him and I couldn't listen to it, had to read it so I could at least try to hear his voices in my head while I read.

Im really not even sure how much power the author has over audiobook decisions in general.  

And I must confess I am not familiar with your writing by just character names being mentioned.
 




 Not disagreeing with you, but I think authors should strive to keep some consistency and it should be recognized as something they should be doing.

It kind of falls under "I writer's responsibility is to only release a book that they feel is worth a readers time and money."  bullet point but when it comes to series I expect them to have some consistency/continuity to them.   There's sort of an implied contract that a fantasy series is going to stay a fantasy series, and not become some weird erotica story based vaguely on your popular series to cash in or fill a quota your publisher set.

Eventually the word and practice will catch up to the author and make it hard to get people to buy their books, but if we're talking morality here, bait and switch/whatever is basically cheating you out of your money based on a good faith history.  Since if you could read the whole book and know what was in it, you wouldn't need to buy it.    If it becomes a "thing authors do in this industry", you are starting a spiral downward on whose to blame for why people need to wait to buy books like it is with video games now for many people.

Hopefully Im coming across here.  Kinda tired.
 




 Im not advocating piracy or anything by saying this, but I think there should be a caveat or......like a third bullet point to cover the instances where authors writing a series go waaaay off the path in the story line.  

Im not going to name anyone specific or a series because I dont want to start that argument, but there is one specific series I have in mind where the series became more about the main character having sex than it did about story.  And that was.....half a dozen or more books into the series.

Now that may be covered under bullet 2, but I think it needs to be pointed out.  That a series should still fit within some semblance of the previous books or it's a fairly big slap in the face to the reader IMO.  

Delays and things potentially can't be helped, but I just can't forget that WTF moment in that series when I was trying to figure out what percentage of the book was sex scenes and how many pages that left of actual story.
 




 And, I think the length drove off anyone who might even attempt to help.  Heh.  Well thanks whoever else upped it.
 




 Your sister is awesome. 




 You are spectacular.  Glad you posted again just so I could see the history.......whew. 




 Kind of depends on the activity for me.  If it's something social, I spend a lot of time analyzing what people say and wondering if it's really as negative as it seemed or meant to be negative or.... or...  and what people think of me and if I should even be there because none of them really like me.


If it's like watching movie at a friends house, usually not to bad unless it's a particularly bad depression day for me...then I wonder if they are just being nice and really want me to leave.


But I haven't hung out with friends in ......a long time now.  A year or more, so I dont even know if they'd still be considered friends.
 




 Pretty sure a plane is considered to be under the laws of the nation it leaves until it's touched down someplace else.  Something along those lines....  since they have to have something in place for transporting prisoners..air marshals etc.
 




 Is the mask coming off, like not fitted well and slipping above your head?  Or are you waking up and taking it off and not remembering?  Like it's someplace unlikely to be if it had just slipped off.

I know that benadryl gives me anxious dreams and makes it hard to sleep.  You take a lot of allergy meds and they might have some affect similar to that of benadryl on me.


I found that with my mask, just clearing my nose with a neti pot or a nose spray or something will allow me to be fine with my allergies until morning due to the filtration and humidity.


It COULD simply just be that the mask you have isn't right for you.  Isn't big enough, too big, or just isn't comfortable enough.  There's a number of full face masks, and there's even one that looks like a fire fighter mask and goes above your eyes and around to just below your bottom teeth.  My brother uses one of the fire fighter masks just because he couldn't find a mask he liked that was smaller. 




 You have a nice body.  Im a tits guy myself, so, enjoying those.
 




 Hotness. 




 I spend unhealthy amounts of time on here looking at girls......you have absolute nothing to be ashamed about.
