 I have the Hogwarts crest, Always, and the dark mark  




 I have tattoos. Like three so far. And more on the way. That's how I rep the wizarding world!!!  




 Maybe post a link to it? I can't find it.... 




 Why is r/Hogwarts private?  




 I was just wondering if there was a sub reddit for Hogwarts.  




 In the audiobooks, it's pronounced Voldemore. In the paper books and movies, it's Voldemort. Someone help?  




 Not true, they die in the reverse order.  




 I actually started at 24mgs because that's the amount a real cigarette has. It's actually better than the patch in my opinion because you still have the hand to mouth, which is what did me in so many times. The hand to mouth habit is the true killer in smoking, and vaping really helps with that. The patch won't satisfy that feeling, so you're more likely to go back to smoking.  




 One nice thing about vaping is that you can progress down!! I'm currently on zero nicotine, but I like the flavour I use. So I continue to do it anyways.  




 So I don't know how to post how long it's been for me, but it's been over a year now. The e cigarette is a joke. I tried one for a while, and I fucking hated it. What you want to do is go to the nearest vape shop. Look it up, google can tell you where it is. Go in and tell them your story. They will help you out. I have a regular shop I go to, and they are some of the nicest, most supportive people I've met (besides my girlfriend of course.) 

Keep it up!! You can do it!! 
























 I'm willing to bet JKR realised that her faithful fandom would bring this point up, though. Hence the reason that Harry became a horcrux.  




 I feel as though the Room of Requirement was a perfect place. In plain sight, however, for close to 50 years he was the only one who knew what it looked like. Incredibly smart in my opinion.  




 He used the blood of a foe (that for being Harry Potter, his 7th and final Horcrux) 




 Bacon, coffee, clean hair, and beer 




 In my opinion, reboots are inevitable. It's gonna happen. My only hope is that the reboots do these movies justice. Otherwise, I don't wanna live on this planet anymore.  




 I'm with you. Never read a single comic. But I love the movies. Like no other.  




 You and I not only have something in common, then, but would also be excellent friends.  




 Cloak and wand. 

The only people I know who have passed, are at peace. I don't want to disturb their peace. They are waiting for me on the other side of the Veil. 

The cloak and wand, they just seem like the logical choices.  




 Ah yes. Some of those plot lines were missing. However, I still believe it was the best. The final movie haas too many disappointments for me.  




 What issue did you have with the third movie? I thought it was the best done of the series.  
























 I don't think I ever noticed that!! You, dear potter head, are awesome!!!  




 And I would be honoured to be among those numbers alongside good brothers and sisters  




 Oh yes. It's real to us.  




 So I'm rereading the fourth book for the 400th time. And I'm at the graveyard with Harry. And I noticed something. One of the trees mentioned is a yew tree. And voldemorts' wand is made of yew. Thought it was an interesting little tidbit!!  




 Welcome home, friend!! 




 I like this idea. This one seems like the most likely to me.  




 Is anyone else curious as to how a howler doesn't explode en route? Like, what kind of magic is used for that? What if a howler had to be sent to somewhere like Bulgaria from England? Just thought of this!!  




 Not all the trials are present before getting to the sorcerers stone.  




 And this is what I was trying to point out :) thank you.  




 Think about it. JKR says that the process for making a Horcrux is difficult and time consuming. If we hold this to truth, then how was Harry "accidental"? Voldie would've had to have had this planned out, correct? Share your thoughts!! 
























 I'm 21, and I've rather recently discovered that I have early onset arthritis in my right knee. So I definitely know your struggle. It's not easy. I usually just use either a compression brace, or a full on DonJoy knee brace, depending on the pain level. However, there are many days I can go without one. But on bad days, I can't really seem to cope with it. I get really irritable, and my closest friends and family can't really seem to be near me. The only one who has been able to stay by me is the wonderful woman I'm dating. She always seems to know what to say or do. My biggest recommendation is to find a good brace, and an even better support system. Because otherwise, at least in my opinion, the pain may just over take you. 

Also, lots of ibuprofen. Always a big help when it comes to inflammation, or any sort of pain. Hope this helped you!! You are not alone!!  




 ......Can someone please tell me what video this is? I've actually never heard of it..... 




 That's not pathetic at all. It's never easy to lose someone you're close with, and when something like this happens, it's completely natural to want to make amends. Don't think that it's pathetic that you want to talk to your grandfather again, and tell him how you feel. 




 As far as the Miranda Rights being read is concerned, they only need to read them to you before booking you. So they have from the time they arrest you to the time they book you to read them to you. Otherwise, anything that you have said before that won't count against you. 

After you've been read them, then the only thing you should say is "I want to speak to a lawyer."  




 First off, congratulations on being clean!! My father ended up kicking meth, so it's always amazing for me to hear of others that are also doing well!! I love hearing about how others can kick those kinds of habits to better themselves!! 

Second, it sounds like your parents don't really deserve your time. (Now that is just my opinion, but I've also had to cut toxic people from my life, so I know the struggle.) It sucks to write/hear, but sometimes that's what's necessary to building a happy and healthy life.

I'm honestly curious, you said the help of NA, and I know that one. Who is the "Bill W" mentioned in this post? 




 This. This is the reason Ron would never join Voldy. He's way more afraid Mrs. Weasley than of the Dark Lord.  




 That makes total sense. Her character feels to forced. And (at least, this is how it feels to me) she is always going on about how she's a lesbian. It almost feels as though the writers just want people to know that, rather than focus on making her a hunter. That's just my two cents though. 




 I never really thought of Charlie in that sense. In fact, I never really think of any of the characters in that sense unless it's a situation like when Sam or Dean has a female guest over. Other than that, to me, they are all just people who hunt the things that go bump in the night. So I guess I'm saying that I personally have never had a problem with Charlie, however, I can definitely see where you would have a problem with her. And kudos to you for pointing this out :) 




 Everyone keeps saying Tony. For some reason, I just can't see it being him. I can, of course, see it being Fury. I, too, feel it needs to be him.  




 That's the best thing about this fandom. Everyone helps everyone else.
