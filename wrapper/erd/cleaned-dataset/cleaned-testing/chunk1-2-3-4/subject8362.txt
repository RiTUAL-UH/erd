 Oh... She laughed hysterically after I did some explaining.  




 How is this funny? 




 A few years back, my friend and I were walking through Target and they had some of these up. She literally got super pissed off that they would make something so dumb and useless and thought they were for cats or some other small animal. I had to explain that they were for display purpose only and not for actual use. She felt pretty dumb. It was awesome. I make fun of her any time we come across anything miniature. To her credit, she was a super stoner back then.  




 Yep... I am a parent of three little girls. I would never pull this.  I want to punch most parents nowadays! 




 I laugh harder and harder every time I watch it. 




 OP must not have kids. I would rather wait an extra 10 minutes in the car than get all of my kids out of the car and have to corral them while in the restaurant. Drive through ANYTHING is a lifesaver when there are small children in the car.  




 That's an adorable baby. Also, a great idea for a baby shower game. 
























 Anyone else see a blonde Emma Stone? 




 Will someone please explain to me why shoes like the one the dude is wearing are in style? The are SO ugly. God, I'm getting old. 




 Yes! Nothing Bundt Cake. Sooo ridiculously good. Lemon flavor?  




 Possibly she's a poo-roctologist  




 What... What is it? 




 Wait... I shouldn't have drawn that on her face when she told me I could? 




 She told me I could. 


































 Mr. Owl says, "The world may never know". 




 They accidentally called her Sarah, instead of Jenny. DAMN YOU JENNY! 




 I lol'ed. Quite a rare occurrence lately for me on r/funny.  




 I am going to watch this video over and over again. Is it because I think the cat and bunny are cute, you ask.... Uhhhh sure. It's the bunny and cat that I think are cute. Fucking cute as FUCK.  

               




 Thanks anyway. You have a great night, too. 




 I know. Same thing applies to  humans who are colorblind. Still thought it was funny when I saw it Yahoo images. 





























 You want to know what is wrong with the tea cup ride?! That fact that it isn't a ride that has a height requirement. I want to enjoy the rides that my kids CAN'T go on!  Totally forgot about the restaurant in Pirates. I will have to go there, too! Childless. Yes!  




 Fun fact:
My husband and I are going to Disneyland next Friday for our anniversary... Without any of our 3 kids. Muahahaha(that was evil laughter, in case you couldn't tell)! This way we get to ride the bigger kid rides. Screw the little kids and their stupid Teacup and It's a Small World rides. I am about to make your plot twist a reality! BAM! 




 It's supposed to rain on Thursday in Southern California. Well, this is according to the weather app on my iPhone. So, it probably won't rain after all. I guess I will put my rain boots away.  :( 




 Not smart... or possibly a drunk? 




 Quick... Someone try a laser pointer! 




 Up... Fucking... Vote  




 I fucking love that someone actually took the time to make a video of how to fix that.

***thinking*** 

"HMMM... What should I do today? Oh, know just the thing!" 




 Nope. I honestly made it because I am extremely over all of the posts. None of them were funny in the first place.
