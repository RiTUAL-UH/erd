 well i had done it and i was looking for it and i found it kind of funny that they have optimized missions so much like the prelude of darkness mission and set ups for css and kyuubi naruto. and the optimizations for characters like fixing shigure and ten ten while keeping the initial idea for how they play 




 So im a fairly old player (started when the site started lost that account so tech around 2009ish) and i remember doing a certain mission a long time ago where you had to use every character to finish and it was just set up for sannin missions. and i wanted to know what it was and if anyone remembers what the requirements entailed ex. what chararcters were used naruto 10/10  




 I made a league video and i enjoyed playing creating and editing the video. So i have uploaded it to youtube i want to know what spots i can possibly improve on and such and i don't want to fall under a specific formula. anyway this is my video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P_jFc_XGaA 




 this reminds me of when i played banjo kazooie im not going to make a post about since i would feel like im ripping off your idea for this but maybe ill just make a video about it but really thanks for sharing this story reminds me of the days as a kid growing up with the better systems hope you can find some nostalgia again some day its the greatest feeling in the world to relive your past  





























 well both are amazing in their own respects however your going to end up being forced to read the manga. not that its bad i love the manga 









 of all the champions in league i only have four left and seeing as i don't care to extremly about which ones i get i thought i would ask here for who i should buy my options are
Varus
Zyra
Galio
Kogma
if you can describe a champion well enough to where its almost like what choice to i have to buy them then ill probably instantly buy them instead of waiting for tahm kench (seeing as i buy the bundles anyway) 
























 i would atleast like some feedback if that isnt to much to ask 









 Master yi : "i sold my jungle item so i could deal more damage who needs that when im going to gank anyway" 




 i think aoki and kimura are going to improve with ippo this time around. Ippo lost and after his last loss he made the dempsy roll, but im thinking this time around ippo will be improving himself by helping aokimura out. possibly creating the new dempsy in the process and making aoki learn a move that isnt the frog punch. kimura just kind of sits back in his matches which isnt bad but he doesnt seem to do anything until the last rounds. were also still waiting on mike bison to find out how that goes if that match goes like the last matches we will see a mixture of hawk and eagle (which is basically just takamura) which would be takamuras biggest weakness. aokimura will see takamuras struggle possibly and realize that their idol could see a loss and want to improve with him. 
























 so with the arrival of new devourer i was wondering some new team comps. I believe that some of you would already have seen, although i am in bronze i feel i can talk about this. 
 Udyr, ezreal, nautilus, caitlyn, Gnar. 
so my reasoning for this is because you can have well poke and good CC at the same time. in a team fight you can easily single target people with either Udyr or Naut. on top of all that you could poke out the enemy team or zone out carries with ez cait and gnar(mini). this team i also feel would work situationally because you would have gnar for backline CC and multi target stuns and knockbacks for a good ez ult followed by multi knockup from naut. Devour would play a huge role here depending on udyr path whether it was tiger or phoenix. phoenix would be great aoe because you could multi flame, and tiger would be good for single target kills on carries. 
so this post was for my idea for some good team comps i wouldnt mind seeing some more be posted whether they are viable or not. 




 well im glad that im noticed in that regard but as you can tell the game was a loss i have alot of improving to do before i can even consider my self good. 




 thank you i love how you put chess in there it really puts it more in perspective for me with that analogy. i will be sure to take all of this information to heart thank you so much.
