 The last time I watched SSY, I think my mind was spinning from everything that happens in the end that the impact was lost a little bit. This time I'm determined to watch it properly! 




 It's taken my second watch to realise that maybe Yakomaru/Squealer's shift in name has deeper meaning than his new, recognised autonomy and authority. When he was named Squealer, he was cowardly and seemingly sold Saki and Satoru out. He's almost literally squealing to save his own skin. 

I don't really know how to feel about Squealer/Yakomaru even now that I've almost finished rewatching SSY... 




 Arguably one of the more interesting characters in Shinsekai Yori, I thought it would be awesome to see what other people thought of him. What do you think of the change in his personality? Do you think he was plotting everything from the start? 

This discussion is to be strictly about Squealer/Yakomaru so spoilers are fine. I mean, it's a bit hard not to discuss a character without talking about everything they've done, right?  




 I've nearly finished watching Shinsekai Yori and I'm just blown away by the impact it has. Like you, it's leaving me deep in thought and I can't help but feel really...dark. SSY isn't a happy anime by any stretch and I think it's meant to really challenge its audience. Ultimately, I think it makes us think a lot about human nature, and nature of ethics. It's hard not to find myself thinking about not only the characters and the plot, but the deeper themes of the anime as well. SSY is probably the best anime I've ever seen.  





























 So I'm going to take an exam this afternoon that I haven't studied for. I'm pretty much resigned to the fact that I'm going to fail. What do you do when you take an exam you haven't studied for? 




 I would definitely suggest going back and trying to watch it again. It is intense...but worth watching!!  




 It's unclear whether it's genetic or not, but my family (from what I've been told) has a history of mental illness. I can't help but think that maybe without that, growing up would have been a lot easier.  
























 Thank you! I actually did this and it helped a lot! :) 




 Thank you! I didn't really do as well as I'd hoped...but I should be alright!  




 Me too. Like right now. 




 Does it have to be Jesus? I'm not confident in how much he knows about International Relations and political theory. 
























 I feel you - that was tough to get through...still think the ending makes all of that worth it though. And to be honest, I felt like Shun's suicide was sadder than Maria and Mamoru leaving... 




 I find this hard to accept - I've never failed a test in my life. 




 I had enough time to study on the train commute thank goodness! I'm probably the worst procrastinator I know. :/ 




 I can't decide if this sounds like a good idea or a bad idea.
