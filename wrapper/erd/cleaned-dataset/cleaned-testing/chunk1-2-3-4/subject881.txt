 It isn't. Commercially available solar cells have an efficiency of 17 to 20 percent, so there is only one fifth of the energy going into electricity. This is even under laboratory conditions. Rawlemon indicates they already be able to achieve an efficiency of more than 50 percent with the glass ball collectors right now. On a squarefoot photovoltaic surface, the prototypes already produces as much electricity as conventional systems generate with a much bigger surface - they are four times as effective.

 One factor is that the Senate thought Caesar wanted to be king and all powerful, the evidence for this is that 'He was happy to be treated like a God' and that 'From that time on Rumours spread that he wanted to be king'.

Another reason was because the Senate thought he was too popular, the evidence for this is that 'Caesar was liked by all the other Generals and 'He led the Army on expeditions that no other General would even dare to consider'. Also 'He was their leader, their idol, the one they were aspired to please.' This links to the paragraph above because he was so popular that many people wanted him to be king.

One other factor for his murder is that the Senate were afraid of his military power; the evidence for this is that 'He was undefeated in battle and that he was respected by the other entire Generals'. In addition to this, one of the army's brave men came forward and said 'He was the greatest warrior of all time, why would any soldier wish to have him dead? He was the bravest man I knew and I don't think that there's a braver man all over the world.' This links to the paragraph above because the senate were afraid of him due to the fact that most people loved him.

The most important reason why the Senate murdered Julius Caesar was because Caesar ignored the wishes of the senate; the evidence to this is that 'They had never forgiven him for entering Rome against their wishes'. Also, Caesar ignored their wishes because some senators hated him. Furthermore, a young woman aged 27 stated 'I am so glad that he ignored the senate's wishes for him not entering Rome because if it wasn't for him the army would not have enough courage or hope to go any further. I couldn't thank him enough for being an amazing General and he will be sorely missed over all of Rome.'

Just before Caesar went to the Senate his wife warned him and asked him not to go but he refused not to go, she said this 'You mustn't go! I fear that something bad is going to happen, I sense a death will occur tonight! Please don't go, I'm begging you'.

  If you are watching naked people in cold weather fart on a regular basis, I assume you would see something.

Just tried to google something like that (video:naked people farting in cold weather). I was not successful. You are wrong as long you are not proofing you're right. 




 Well, in this case it would be possible to see a "wet" fart. But i never did. 




 It's a myth. Joints produce that crack when bubbles burst in the fluid surrounding the joint.

Joints are the meeting points of two separatebones, held together and in place by connective tissues and ligaments. All of the joints in our bodies are surrounded by synovial fluid, a thick, clear liquid. When you stretch or bend your finger to pop the knuckle, you're causing the bones of the joint to pull apart. As they do, the connective tissue capsule that surrounds the joint is stretched. By stretching this capsule, you increase its volume. And as we know from chemistry class, with an increase in volume comes a decrease in pressure. So as the pressure of the synovial fluid drops, gases dissolved in the fluid become less soluble, forming bubbles through a process calledcavitation. When the joint is stretched far enough, the pressure in the capsule drops so low that these bubbles burst, producing the pop that we associate with knuckle cracking.

It takes about 25 to 30 minutes for the gas to redissolve into the joint fluid. During this period of time, your knuckles won't crack. Once the gas is redissolved, cavitation is once again possible, and you can start popping your knuckles again.  

[ The common claim that cracking one's knuckles causesarthritisappears unsupported.]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_joints#Effects)

 




 This is a question bothering me a long time. I mean, it's body temperatered air in both cases. 














 
Quote from Wikipedia:

BASIC(anacronymforBeginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a family ofgeneral-purpose,high-level programming languageswhose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use.

In 1964,John G. KemenyandThomas E. Kurtzdesigned the original BASIC language atDartmouth Collegein New Hampshire. They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers. At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing custom software, which was something onlyscientistsandmathematicianstended to learn how to use.

 If you lock your keys in the car and the spare keys are at home, call someone at home on their cell phone from your cell phone.

 Once upon a time there was a wise man who used to go to the ocean to do his writing. He had a habit of walking on the beach before he began his work. One day he was walking along the shore. As he looked down the beach, he saw a human figure moving like a dancer. He smiled to himself to think of someone who would dance to the day. So he began to walk faster to catch up.

As he got closer, he saw that it was a young man and the young man wasn't dancing, but instead he was reaching down to the shore, picking up something and very gently throwing it into the ocean.

As he got closer he called out, "Good morning! What are you doing?"

The young man paused, looked up and replied, "Throwing starfish in the ocean."

"I guess I should have asked, why are you throwing starfish in the ocean?"

"The sun is up and the tide is going out. And if I don't throw them in they'll die."

"But, young man, don't you realize that there are miles and miles of beach and starfish all along it. You can't possibly make a difference!"

The young man listened politely. Then bent down, picked up another starfish and threw it into the sea, past the breaking waves and said- "It made a difference for that one."

 Sometimes that shark....he looks right into ya. Right into your eyes. And, you know, the thing about a shark hes got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a dolls eyes. When he comes at ya, doesnt seem to be living until he bites ya, and those black eyes roll over white and then ah then you hear that terrible high-pitched screamin. The ocean turns red, and despite all the poundin and the hollerin, they all come in and they rip you to pieces. 

So, eleven hundred men went in the water; 316 men come out and the sharks took the rest.

 Dont say Dont call me again or similar. This will lead them to ask why. Be polite but firm. If they ask why or wont do it right away, remain calm and repeat, I want you to put me on your do not call list.   

Its illegal for a company to keep calling you if youre on this list. Unfortunately, it is not illegal for charities or political parties. But most of those run seasonal campaigns, so at least your lead will be put to rest for three to 11 months.
