 I need absolute quiet when I'm sleeping. Thats the reason I wear headphones to bed (it's done the trick til now). Rain sounds sooth me but I can't fall asleep with them. Thanks though! 




 whats a white noise machine? 




 Recently my flatmates have taken to watching tv on their laptop in the hall of our flat. There are three of them and it only started happening recently. They put on youtube clips of movies, songs (and sing a long with them) and talk really loudly. Sometimes they scream and one tends to shriek a lot. Sometimes I can hear them running up and down the flat chasing eachother like children. FYI - no drinking involved.
Usually I put up with it but when I have a 9am lecture (and I know that none of them are in until around 12pm) I can tell its gonna be a long night. I shouldn't have to put up with this though right?
Also I have depression to getting sleep is really important. I have said to them nicely that I was trying to sleep (that was last night) and they quietened down but I'm afraid that they will be more bitchy to me if I come out and say it on a regular basis. 
BUT ITS FUCKING ANNOYING!
So what do I do? This is uni accomodation so I have to stay til June and can't change flats (another flatmate of ours applied ages ago because of them and was told there is none) 




 I do. I feel guilty because I have had nothing in my life was truly traumatic (though my bio dad did stop contact with me when I was 9) or horrifying in my life to make me feel this way. I also have nothing to be sad for. I am university, have enough money and then some to get by and live a 'decent' life. So why do I feel like I hate my life  that I'd be better off dead? It makes no sense to me but it is what it is. 
























 I moved here not long ago and have already done the main things. Also went to the elephant house recently and stopped by a cool shop called Joe. Does anyone know any cool wee places to go? Preferably not including museums, monuments or anything like that. Also does anyone know if there are any cool themed restaurants or cafes or anything? Thank you!

Edit: Thanks to everyone who has recommended a place to go. I will definitely be trying to get to all of these the next time I'm out exploring Edinburgh City.  




 There is a girl who is an orphan and lives with maids of a house (its set in either the 19th or 20th century). She either finds an amulet or is in possession of an amulet. Either way, word gets around and a woman comes knocking claiming to be her mother, who takes her away to live with her. I think part of the book is set in Venice. In the end, the girl realizes that the woman was not her mother but forgives her anyway. Does anyone know this book? 




 she is saying how its hypocritical that her mum won't allow her birth control (because its against Catholicism) yet her mum is a lesbian (which is also against Catholicism) 




 I have avoided talking about personal things and my true feelings since I can remember and am really anxious about my doctor's appointment today. Just to be prepared I have printed out a PHQ and filled it in but I'm still really nervous and panicky. Any tips?

EDIT: Thanks everyone! I had my appt. and it went really well. She was straightforward, actually listened to me and then gave me a perscription and told me to use my free uni councelling service. It really helped that I braught with me the PHQ. I now have a perscription for fluoxetine. 
























 I'm quite jealous of you. My older pig just tolerates me with no enthusiasm and my younger pig is learning from her! 




 I'm 18 and I usually pop by r/scotland but have recently added r/edinburgh to that. 




 I'll try it sometime. I went to cafe Andaluz recently which had lovely food and that was tapas so I should enjoy empires cafe too. 




 oh awesome! where are they all? 
























 Yes I do second-guess my depression a lot. It doesn't help that some people tell me that I'm not depressed, just lazy.  




 I'm not sure if it changes where you are from but as long as you have a medical note from your doctor and you have been experiencing problems with it then you should 'qualify'. They can't reject you because people need to realise this is a real condition and it has real affects to daily life. Whether you are in uni or have a job or both - depression can make it a lot harder to keep up and get by. 




 Because I feel like I might be milking it a bit and they might think that I'm just attention seeking or something. But I'll take what I can get 




 I secretly do so I'll wait til they bring it up and then start my guns.
