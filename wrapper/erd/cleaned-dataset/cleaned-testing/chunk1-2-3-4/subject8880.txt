 IT'S WHAT I REMEMBER WALT!! 




 I did. Scroll down. 




 Walter, have you ever drank shots of liquid cocaine and Jack Daniels? 
Walt, it was closing time and when closing time happens, legs open.... 




 Da fuck? 




 I agree. I dropped the book when I glanced at the cover and said "What the fuck?" really loud.
Yeah, I took the pic when I dropped it. Someone placed it in the Sci-Fi aisle. 




 What is your impression of the cover art? 




 I fucked a fat chick and didn't know until the next day. Woke up naked in the bed, used the phone on her night stand to call friend, message on phone said "Dial 1 and area code for the number you are dialing", jump up, find phone book from Kansas. 
I live in Tennessee. 




 Long story short : It all started with a bookshelf and naked pics of them both. 




 That is weird as fuck.

 Idea I had a few years ago that crossed my mind. See, you know how DC always fucks up the Archie superhero universe? 
I had this crazy thought about rebooting Archie Comics into a superhero universe.
Riverdale? Big as New York? Archie Andrews?
Well, he is the Fly. The Golden Age,Silver Age,etc. All of the past Crusaders, Shield,Blue Ribbon Comics stuff has happened, but rebooting Archie would have him on par with Spider-Man as the Fly (the rookie superhuman dealing with experienced heroes).

 So anyone whos been on the /v/ board at 4chan. probably knows about Mr. Bones Wild Ride. For those who dont, it was a ride someone made for Roller Coaster Tycoon. It was one of those really slow motor car rides but with a twist. It had 30,696 feet of track and a ride time of 70 real time minutes, around four years ingame time. In addition there were those props of the skeleton holding out his top hat scattered around here and there, as if to mock the customers. Needless to say, there were a lot of passengers screaming I WANT TO GET OFF MR. BONES WILD RIDE!
Now heres where things get really good. Once the ride came to a stop, the passengers found themselves on a long path that took about 2 hours to traverse. Once they reached the end, they found themselves facing a sign that read Mr. Bones says: The ride never ends!
The path lead straight back to the entrance of Mr. Bones Wild Ride. There was nowhere else to go. In other words, they were fucked. Needless to say this gained a lot of popularity on /v/ and people started making their own Mr. Bones Wild Ride. I was one of them and made a version with the ghost train ride. You know the one thats usually a huge death trap. It didnt last as long as the original but it did have a twist. Near the end it launched the cars into a small shed with a sign on the side that said Enjoy your stay! I killed about 20 people with that ride and laughed my ass off as they each went one by one to their graves.
Fast forward a few weeks and I was in Busch Gardens on vacation. I was wandering around trying to decide what to ride. Thats when I noticed a ride that hadnt been there the last time I visited. It was weird because it had never been advertised and there was nothing on the map about it. I figured what the hell and got in line.
Surprisingly the line wasnt very long. I only waited about 10 minutes to get on. It was one of those motor car rides which is kind of weird because they already had one elsewhere in the park. Why would they open up a second one? After buckling in I looked up ahead and froze. There was a giant skeleton up ahead tipping a hat to me with a sign over his head. No I whispered. The sign read Mr. Bones Wild Ride.
I struggled with my restraints but they wouldnt come off. I begged the employee contolling the ride to help and that I had changed my mind but he ignored me. My car started moving and I screamed in terror. Up ahead the track stretched on for what seemed like forever. I WANT TO GET OFF MR. BONES WILD RIDE!

  Barkley: Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden! 

On November 28, 2012 Tales of Game's announced the game's sequel, The Magical Realms of Tr na ng: Escape from Necron 7  Revenge of Cuchulainn: The Official Game of the Movie  Chapter 2 of the Hoopz Barkley SaGa, with a Kickstarter campaign to help fund it. The campaign ended on December 28, 2012, and raised $120,335.

While the sequel will retain the original's self-aware tone, all of the artwork is being created from scratch to avoid copyright issues.

  also wouldn't be an old image that this reporter simply doesn't recognize. Ted Kord has only ever shared a single panel with this version of Booster Gold before -- in Futures End: Booster Gold. That issue saw Booster careening out of control through DC's Multiverse, before ending up "home" in the pre-Flashpoint DC Universe. The armored costume -- generally depicted with an A.R.G.U.S. emblem on it, although not here -- first appeared in the Justice League International Annual #1 in the New 52, meaning that Ted Kord was not a superhero and shared no history with Booster Gold when that look debuted.

It's likely that this Booster Gold is the same one who, in a different uniform, lent guidance and occasional surreptitious assitance to his younger self and his son Rip Hunter during Booster Gold Volume 2. That "Older Booster" was last seen just before Flashpoint during the Time Masters: Vanishing Point miniseries tied to the Return of Bruce Wayne event. That version of Booster would have been the one whose younger self worked extensively with Blue Beetle on the JLI and later the Justice League America.

Currently, the pair of old friends and former Justice Leaguers are working together in Justice League 3000...but that doesn't take place in the "regular" DC Universe, but instead in a similar universe where Keith Giffen and J.M. DeMatteis' humor-tinged, nostalgic take on the Justice League International is the standard. That world is a version of the pre-New 52 DC Universe, but one in which (among other things) Ralph Dibny isn't dead and Max Lord never went evil.

 Damn ya pillhead. 




 Just imagine the updates and the software slowdown when Apple makes another car.

 Iron Man 2020 Armor! Arno Stark confirmed. 




 Ted Kord returns! 




 Recently obtained a huge collection of 70s-00s Baseball/Football/Basketball cards and want to trade them. I am dividing them into team sets as I speak.


I'm looking for any 60s-00s Baseball/Basketball/Football Star commons or oddball cards, Topps Poker Chips, Garbage Pail Kids cards, Marvel/DC Comics cards (Especially Marvel/DC/Image Overpower), Magic The Gathering uncommons/rares, Metal CDs, Blu-Ray movies, etc.

NINJA EDIT : I like game used/relic/autographed cards in Baseball/Basketball/Football/Non-Sport too 




 Our timeline was split in 2000 during the Presidential elections. It was tied, so the timeline split in half causing 9/11 and other glitches. 




 He has the Omni-Gauntlet. 




 That was a good Metal album. 




 Mid-90's Justice League books after Giffen/DeMattis left was more 90's than X-Treme Justice.
It's the forgotten JLA. They went back to space, Nuklon and Metamorpho joined when he had shoulder pads.

Google it. It's a horrible JLA run. 




 Hawk And Doved ended in 1990 or 1991? 




 The real Gotham City? 




 Don't stick your dick in crazy. 




 But Jackson,Tn on the other hand... 




 West Tennessee is a hateful shithole to the rest of the state. 




 The Tennessee/Mississippi state line has the most amount of crazy white bitches you ever seen. The West Tennessee border with North Mississippi is proof. 




 Pop Country is worse than Nickelback. And I really fucking hate Nickelback. 









 HORSE The Band. 

EDIT : SHAPESHIFT is a different take on Metal. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0fcwYaABw8 




 Could be a body. 




 Just imagine the thought of someone who you been with for 20+ years leaving you or dying.
That is more frightning. 




 Is this bullshit? 




 Some but not good X-Titles. Bunch of 90's shit. 




 Right now some Beer Signs and Flags, KISS sealed figures,etc. 




 i have a crapload of Superman books in storage right now. I would have to get back at you when the snow storm is over. 




 Looking for any Nu-52 Superman books, 80s/90s Superman books, Superman figures,etc.? 




 Laserdisc. 




 I moved into a new apartment a few weeks ago. When I opened my closet door, a skeleton popped out.
It scared the ever living shit out of me. 




 Continuity. The basis for a deep story and a working universe. 




 Russia is a slapstick of a country. Why do people hate it so much? 




 Or Mid-Life Crisis hipsters. 




 Over-Man from Grant Morrison's Animal Man, Capt. Marvel from Kingdome Come and the League Of Batmen from the DC Multiverse. 




 And Guns N Roses. 




 I play Titanfall on the PS4. You think Sony would give me a PS4? 




 Damn. You would think that actors/actresses can afford the stuff, but giving it away? 




 Example? 




 Fuck your Comcast Propaganda. 




 Alot of lenders at banks seem to have alot of free time and fuck like rabbits. 




 I wanna be an actor now. 




 So the family gets the shit stuff? 




 You must be talking about A Flock Of Seagulls. 




 I accidently found an old friend's BDSM gear once. 




 What band are you in if I may ask? 
Please don't say Kajagoogoo. 




 They called him Capt.Marvel in the comics but not on the covers. I should know, I read them. 




 I read that in Scrawny Armed Rob Lowe's voice. 




 This sounds suspiciously like Jackson,Tennessee 




 In a very public forum, I would never link my resume with private information. 
I was asking a simple question if anyone has information for careers in the Memphis area. Not to throw attention to employers, but to throw my curiousity into the 901 area.  




 If only I was a good cook. I'm mostly interested in anything IT, security or even anything at the Fed-Ex Forum or a hotel. 




 Now that's adventure. Was you high? 




 I would like to see her skeet... 




 Adventure? How is going to a roof an adventure? 




 It's not as bad as Youngblood. 




 Casino jobs don't pay very much. 




 Booster Gold acts like an ass because it's his legacy as a Time Master to protect himself.  




 I seen Ted Kord get love handles and worry about his weight once. 




 It's already written in long form by me. 




 A cosmic entity created bythe One-Who-Cannot-Be-Named.  Every alien race interprets the Eye differently by their concept of judgment. Our human concept is an Eye or a witness.... 




 Dr.Light's silliness was Silver Age also but retconmed by Identity Crisis? The accent could have been an off-panel retcon. 




 I'm white but can't swim. Fuck deep water! 




 ..But I am happy. Happy enough to put it in my cigar box full of 70s/80s/90s star cards. 
I know they are not worth much, but it's a classic rookie. That is what I like about this hobby. 




 Then why did he speak with an Anerican accent in his first appearences?  The writers knew he was Australian. 




 Capt. Boomerang had an Australian accent in 80's Suicide Squad. I like to think that it was Zantanna who mind warped him to speak in that accent. 




 The Eye was one of the first cosmic entities in comics. Since the Eye is Public Domain, I consider hin in a role similar to the Living Tribunal/the Watcher in my universe.
"Eye witness the Multiverse unfold into anarchy....." 




 Speed force doesn't exist in a Antimatter 5th Dimensional Multiverse. Imagination does. 




 I swear I remember talking to her on the phone years ago. 




 How do we know if the 5th Dimension isn't lying to us? 




 Explosions. Beer. Chickens. Sounds like McNairy County to me. 




 Who said it doesn't exist? Maybe it's safe in the Antimatter Multiverse? 




 She's just hiding her bruises. 




 The homeless person because I have no idea if they are homeless or not.
I have trust issues with humanity.

 I enjoyed John Byrne, Jerry Ordway and Dan Jurgans runs on Supes. Anyone else? 




 I thought Doomsday was Darkseids living weapon?
