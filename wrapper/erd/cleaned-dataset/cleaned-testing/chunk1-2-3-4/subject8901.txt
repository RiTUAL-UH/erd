 I know that it is definitely used elsewhere, but how much? Is there a way of tracking how much it is used in a nation's media outlets and using that data as some sort of quantifier for how negative or positive the connotations of "liberal" are in a specific country?

 There is NOTHING shitty about peanut butter. EVER. You hear me? You could spread PB on a turd and I would happily eat it. 




 I liked having a tall locker. The smaller ones were hard to get into if the dude below you was fucking around in theirs. I once had a small locker (a bottom one), and the person who had the locker above mine left a sandwich in theirs throughout the Christmas break. The smell of rotten salami and mayonnaise made its way into my locker and stayed there for the rest of the year. The few articles of clothing I left behind over the break smelled, my gym shoes smelled (and not like my sweaty feet), and worst of all my text books smelled. I had to throw out everything except the text books, because I couldn't just replace those --they were way too expensive. I used those text books for the rest of the year, even though they stunk up every classroom they entered.  
  
TL;DR - don't rent a small locker.

 On closer inspection (now that I'm on a computer and not my phone) I can say I'm almost certain that is not a fallstreak hole. What you have there looks like a small gap in a layer of stratocumulus cloud, which is actually pretty common. It could be because of the way the cloud is forming or dissipating, or it could just be that the clouds are moving in such a way as to form a gap. Fallstreak holes usually only occur in mid to high level convective clouds, such as altocumulus and cirrocumulus. 




 Yep, that's a fallstreak hole.
