 I have little knowledge on building PCs but my friend does I found this design on reddit and I want to know if it will work without anything else (besides a monitor keyboard and a mouse).

Thanks a lot  
























 It is indeed :)
but did you have to buy anything not listed for it to run? 
























 Hi this is my first time building a PC an I am wondering how important are monitors?  Do they have to be comparable with certain parts or will any monitor do?  

I'm building a PC using the parts mentioned in this video + the extra parts in the comments could someone please recommend me a monitor to use.
