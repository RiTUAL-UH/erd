 Accountants know which businesses are thriving and managed the best: which painter, roofer, plumber, electrician, dentist, etc. 














 Dear [test_subject937],

Thank you for contacting me about net neutrality.

I oppose any form of censorship or discrimination. I believe those who pay for our web capacity must be able to recover their costs, or it won't get built.

Supporters of net neutrality argue that giving all internet users the highest speed and greatest volume of space available - whether or not they contribute to the cost of building that capacity - is the only way to guarantee that no one will be discriminated against on the basis of what they want to say. However, there is very little incentive for carriers to build infrastructure if they have no way to recoup their costs. Without such an incentive, many new high bandwith applications, such as medical technology and communications for emergency personnel, many not be feasible.

Simply put, I believe providers shouldn't be able to block access to any other providers on the basis of content, and access to the capacity that has been built by the public should be open to the public on equal terms. But, access to future capacity should be open on equal terms to those who share the cost of its construction.

Thanks again for caring enough to get involved, and please don't hesitate to contact me again in the future.

Sincerely,

John Barrow

 I couldn't find anything about it (and hope this sub is appropriate). Does anyone have any idea?

Will voice calls via Hangouts have to use a Google Voice number or will it use the phone's? 




 It's been posted on their Facebook page.

Thanks for all the great memories! 










































































 I'm hearing that the water tower by the ANGC busted due to the earthquake. It was leaking before then - big time. We saw water cascading out about 15 minutes before the quake. 









 And which is worse? 
























 Apart from PDF Mergy, I haven't been able to find many apps that allow manipulation of PDFs. I'd really like to be able to split a PDF into two, rotate a page, and perform OCR.

Any suggestions? 














 I just received an email allegedly from Google (no-reply@accounts.google.com) stating that someone attempted to sign into me Google Account. The email has the standard blue button link to reset my password.

I was initially suspicious so I did a quick search and it seems bogus. Can anyone here confirm that it is not legitimate? I reported the email as a phishing attempt.

Thanks! 









 Is anyone else having this problem? My Nexus 7 (2013) randomly reboots at least once a day, but usually more. It's annoying and since I use it for work, it often happens at critical moments.

Also, I have Google Maps on the home row and it is removed every time it reboots. All the other slots are folders so I'm not sure if that's the cause or if it is something specific to Google Maps. 









 An earlier thread had a discussion about how we used to count by suns/daytime and nights. It makes more sense for a "day" to begin at roughly sunrise. Was this standardized by the same folks who standardized the calendar? 



















 [Google Calendar Auto-fill](http://i.imgur.com/p6BYAd4)

 We drove about 450 miles both ways. Using Maps, we were able to anticipate delays and find routes around them.

All told, we dodged 4 massive jams. It's hard to know how much time we saved but we figure at least an hour, maybe two. 




 For one, it assumes household finances are analogous to government finances. And it tells us _nothing_ important (because it's a low bar we all meet - to be a functioning adult is to balance a checkbook).

Is there a way that it is/can be used that is not a cop out? In my experience, it is usually said by someone who doesn't want to be tied to the social platform of the Republican party, but more so doesn't want to be thought of as a liberal or a Democrat.

I've thought this for years and am genuinely curious that I am missing something. 












































 I'd like to be able to give my boyfriend access to my reminders (and vice versa). When we are running low on, say, toilet paper, either one of us can say: "Remind me and [boyfriend] to buy toilet paper at Kroger."

When either one of us goes to Kroger... ding!

It seems like it would be easy for Google to do, and I'm sure there are other ways it could be used. Thoughts, /r/Android? 



















 Both cheeks when the shadow covers the entire lane; left or right when it only covers the left or right portion.

I'm 31 and still love doing it. I tell myself it's why I have a bedonk. 














 I have very little knowledge of the net's infrastructure so forgive me if it's a dumb question. It just seems to me that the very nature of the internet makes it impossible to truly be anonymous. 



































































































 I apologize if this has been asked and answered. I searched this sub and Google but couldn't find an answer.

The sound works fine for seemingly everything else.

Thanks in advance, r/applehelp! 





























 Augusta, GA here! My boyfriend and I are planning a NYC trip during Masters weekend this year (April 12th to 14th). Neither of us have been there before and we need some help finding a hotel. Any reasonably priced but decent suggestions?

Thanks in advance! 




 Bottom line is as it appears: what can be done here? My cousin is such a good person - but she has decided that his lack of belief in the Christian god is a deal breaker.

I'm asking for effective advice... he wants to be with her. He does not want her to "convert" to his "religion"; but she is demanding the same.

Is this fair? And what can be done (in good faith)? 




 Karma is no more/less valuable than video game points. And the frontpage seems very similar to a final boss.

Does reaching the front page reduce this tendency? Front page fame is not worthless; fame a second time is still something.

Is a game any less valuable?
 














 The good Senator is deleting all the comments because he isn't getting the response he thought he'd get.

It also appears he edited the original post (I have a screenshot).

Who's up for showing him how wrong he is? I bet we can post comments quicker than he can delete them! 









 What is the best way to verify the team of someone requesting membership on G+? I've seen people suggest requesting a screenshot of the comm with the invitee's name (and color) but I'm not convinced that is very reliable.

Thanks in advance! 









 What is Google's end game? What will a fully unified Google Account look like and how will it enhance your life?

Also, what are some product combinations you would like to see? 














 When the app loads and locks in on the player, does it zoom in on your exact location on the globe? It does for me (and I assume Google wouldn't choose my small-ish city as a default, hence the possible dumbness). 









 We were trying to destroy resonators by a museum around midnight. They saw my parked car and got out to investigate. At this point, I don't think they knew we were there. 

We approached them and they asked what we were up to. We showed them the phone and explained that it is a global game of capture the flag created by Google. That simple explanation dropped the tension level down dramatically (they didn't know what they were walking into until then). 

They laughed and checked it out a bit. Told us not to get "attacked" ourselves, and went on their way. 

Overall, it was a good experience. We told them that they might start seeing more people like us and it's just a game.  




 From the letter posted on the investigation board:

SWEKU 
XKCWDJHOYELFMSBZUQI 
ARSMZEPIWOUK

Does anyone know what it means? It doesn't seem like a alphabetical substitution cipher... 




 Where's the big surprise? Does anyone know if anything actually happened tonight? 









 Call it an embarrassment of riches but I am getting email notifications constantly (I pretty much own every portal in the area and you get one for every resonator destroyed). 

Can we turn these GD notifications off? I suppose I can create a filter but that's just a work-around. 









 Check out the history map for a good overview of your work!

I've been active for about 7 days and... WOW! I've covered my area quite nicely.

(I'd post my map but it's all buggy this morning for some reason.) 




 Can anyone confirm (from an official source) that we are currently in beta?

And if so, what will be the major changes between beta and the official release? Obviously there will probably be no invitation process. What about items? Will they rain down from heaven like they do now (when turning in codes)?

I'd like to see this turn into a general "how the official release will differ from beta" thread if possible. 




 I have trouble pronouncing "pronunciation". Not because I wasn't exposed to or didn't know the correct pronunciation, but because a friend of mine hilariously mispronounced it one day while trying to defend his failure to properly pronounce another word (resulting in an ongoing joke that is over 10 years old). 

Now I legitimately get the the two versions confused and have to pause and mentally say it before verbally saying it. 



















 For me, it's the definition of despotism. The Civilization series introduced me to that word and it seems like a term that most people should know.

But I distinctly remember one of my best friends in college needing a definition from me when I used the term to describe Saddam Hussein's regime.

She is very intelligent and well-educated, which only made it that much more perplexing to me.

So, Reddit, what other examples are there? 







































 Well I don't disagree. But will South Africa have a food shortage without China? 




 Nah - I'm a liberal Dem. Just passing the info along. (Plus I'll be out of town.) 




 I agree (work in the legal field). Perjury is for some reason not taken that seriously.

As testimony is often the only available evidence, perjury _should_ be a primary concern of the judicial system. 




  If it's economic pressure, you can't really blame the SA government.

Every decision has various pressures. How far are you willing to take this?

 









 My personal experience definitely confirms this. I wore it from 7:45 am until 8:45 pm yesterday and it had ~30% left.

I responded to texts, used navigation, controlled music in the car, received various notifications throughout the day, and checked the time several times. I would consider my usage moderate to heavy.

This is a dramatic increase from the battery before the update. I was going to return the damn thing and now I don't think I will. 




 Get a flu shot regardless of your age. Protect your tiny and elderly loved ones! 




 Because they're not humans with our varied motivations. 




 Did my reply disappear? Weird. But, yeah, no worries. I'm sure everyone gets the same initial letter - I just didn't realize (until /u/tonytaylor85 pointed it out in this thread) that everyone gets the same letter every time. 




 Why? Seriously? It's literally a Representative's job to be responsive to constituents. This sort of thing could _really_ piss someone off, particularly the type of person who takes the time to contact their Representative twice about the same issue.

And you don't need unique letters for each person, just succeeding letters: 1st inquiry, 2nd inquiry, etc. And probably after the second, a valid response would be "My position hasn't changed since the last letter." Hell, even that would be better than sending the same letter the second time.

It'd be as simple as a spreadsheet. Even small businesses handle more workflow than that... 




 It's surprising to me that it wasn't updated, yes. I would think they have a simple procedure to avoid exactly this situation. 




 Ignore the haters - congratulations! You look great! 




 Internationally respected human rights lawyer is a damn good catch. 




 Downtown is safe during Westobou, particularly the old Academy. It's kinda odd to claim otherwise, really.

I know I'll be there. 




 *Katy Perry 




 Nested cubes rotating in succession. 




 No, just go back to /u/TheBrokenWorld's suggestion. "Doing nothing" and your awful idea aren't the only two options. 




 Or between movies. 




 Realized how great this is last weekend on a road trip.

When in unfamiliar towns on back roads, there are often a lot of turns. I was behind an impromptu caravan and they all went right when I thought I was supposed to go left. I had about 3 seconds to decide and the watch allowed me to verify to go left.

Not much but it was pretty damn nice. 




 Awareness does have value. 




 It was yesterday. Allen's camp said a video of it would be on their website by Monday. 




 I'm not quite there yet but did just walk out of Costco with more cash than I arrived with. 




 Rick Allen said his supporters wouldn't feel comfortable in a mosque.

He apparently thinks that is a valid reason. 




 But where? The whole nation has this problem. 




 Most of downtown doesn't fit the "frat boy" stereotype. It's actually the exception. Go to The Loft for starters.

And I agree that online dating isn't bad. Why expect to randomly run into a compatible partner? That's inefficient as fuck. 




 Well... it's printed on each panel so yeah. 




 I think this exists. 




 But it's vital that we pay attention and participate. 




 Wait what's her new addiction? 




 Yup. As a Georgian, it was great knowing my vote mattered. 




 Good start though. Give them that. For what it's worth, I'm a gay atheist (not in a Muslim majority country). 




 Oh! _This'll_ show the conservative commentators of my local paper! 




 I hate ultra orthodox everything. 




 You know what? Fuck you, man. The same could be done for Christianity. Islam =/= terrorism.

Edit: And based on your short comment history, this is your "thing". People like you make the world a worse place. 




 Man it was so exciting to watch. Every Tuesday was "Super Tuesday" and you never knew who would be ahead week to week.

It was one of the best elections I've ever witnessed. 









 [Here's](http://www.wfxg.com/story/26621875/who-called-off-congressional-debate-at-mosque) an article from WFXG about the kerfuffle. 














 After reading the article that is the only source for the Wikipedia entry, and perusing the restaurant's English site, I don't see any evidence that the same restaurant has been in business for 900 years (regardless of menu changes). 




 Does it though? I assume this is the source of your claim:

The medieval town is mainly famous for its stone bridge over the Danube, built between 1135 and 1146... To complete the construction of this bridge, Roman workers counted on Bavarian sausages to keep them going.

Sausages were sold there at that time but there isn't any indication that sausages have been sold there continuously since 1146. And even if they have been, it doesn't seem that it's been the same business:

The recent owners of the restaurant purchased it in 1806 from the Regensburg State authority.

It's an impressive building for sure and it may have been used only as a sausage restaurant when actually in use, but there is nothing in the article to really support the claim that there has been the same business there for 900 years (which is what the title claims). 




 The source for the Wikipedia article states the _building_ is 900 years old, not the business. Or am I reading that wrong? 




 As a Georgian... do this. Make this happen. 




 Yeah it's not that hard to do just as quickly. I'm American and chose to switch to 24-hour because it makes more sense and is useful for my work. That was about 5 years ago and 20:15 means the same thing in my head that 8:15 p.m. does. No math needed. 




 I disable push notifications for this reason. Fuckers are mean. 




 I unsuccessfully tried switching 360's with my boyfriend (he has the silver model, I have the black) and now I can't choose Facer from the watch face options. :-(

I've tried uninstalling/installing and resetting the watch but nothing seems to work.

Anyone had this happen? Any suggestions? 




 Yes. 




  It's possible to refer to people without gendering them.

Not using pronouns in English is very difficult if you have more than a brief interaction with the person. I sit on the board of a statewide LGBT organization and one of our interns is transgendered (F to M). He and I were scheduled to spend an entire day together and I ultimately had to ask our Executive Director for guidance. As for his name, it was completely neutral and provided no additional information. 




 In my experience, clothing isn't really helpful. 




 Thank you. 









  Within the constitutional framework. 




 Somewhat changes the impression someone may get from your emphasis of "am". It was essentially "I'm not American but I've got a justice boner." 




 It's a shame your parent comment has now been deleted. And he had gold. 




 I think I've seen on cable news that analysts think Syria's passive consent would probably be required. Anyone seen that? 




 I hope the involvement of Arab states changes the equation.

Edit: I responded when the post was just the first sentence (not sure if that's relevant though). 




 The "OMG, it works!" posts are much more obviously bullshit though. 




 Deciding to change and then changing is one of the most impressive things anyone can do. 




 When I was in college and worked at my dad's office over the summers, he introduced me as "Studley Do-Right". Complete dead pan.

I would then have to exist as Studley Do-Right for that person... 




 Top 5 childhood games. Leveling up spells was so satisfying. 




 I lost 20 lbs on a vanilla milkshake diet after this surgery. 




 One I know for a fact is an army base. 




 Delicate question but this seems like a good place to ask it.

If someone's gender is not apparent to me, how do I clear that up in a non-offensive way so proper pronouns are used, etc.? 




 Just reading the word "trypophobia" makes my skin crawl. And I didn't know I had this phobia until reddit... (thanks, assholes). 




 [sniff] I love you, Mom.
 




 I didn't mean to be judgmental and apologize. As our earning capacity increases, we can lose sight of how things used to be and how things are for other people.

I recommend Revenge and Orange is the New Black. Both are very binge-worthy. 




 I wondered that, too. Was it more of a "not a priority" thing or actually a "cannot afford" thing? 




 Straight as can be (he runs with his blonde, model-level girlfriend). 




 Runs around shirtless showing off his ridiculously toned physique. For a gay male couple, it's one part awe and one part seething hatred/jealousy. 




 I agree. This is a good suggestion. 




 Old book smell makes me need to poop. Am I alone in this? 




 Ah. It might be said somewhere English is spoken but it's probably rare.

Do you know what the two different verb tenses are? English seems to hide tenses that are more easily identified in other languages. 




 I don't think I've ever heard anyone use that contraction verbally in that context. I only encounter it when it's the certain tense, e.g., "they have been" - "they've been"; "they have gone" - "they've gone". 




 There's simply no option for it on the web version.
 




  They've to

Do you say this? 




 Yup. We both saw it (we'd be doubting our sanity otherwise). 




 My boyfriend had a notification card in Keep this evening (the web-version ones that pop up to explain new features and you click "Got it" to close). It said that you can now share Keep notes and specifically mentioned editing among family and friends.

Unfortunately, we didn't think to do a screenshot and now we can't find _anything_ about it. Has anyone received that notification? Any word that this is actually in the pipeline? 




 I'm not trying to find racism. That's not what this is about. This is about the patently absurd notion that today's GOP - if teleported back in time - would be the ideological party of Lincoln.

And still no sources from you... 




 Voting patterns changed in part due to how the parties [reacted](http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/07/14/331298996/why-did-black-voters-flee-the-republican-party-in-the-1960s) to the Civil Rights movement. Republicans have not changed their position on economic issues, but they have on social issues.

And how about providing sources rather than calling people names? 




 It's been circulating for years because it is a [historical fact](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t source=web rct=j ei=_dkdVKX9LZWsyATU7oKoAw url=http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/reversal2.pdf cd=7 ved=0CC0QFjAG usg=AFQjCNHqFzh82rIE-WAnvqlfLHabrruCFg sig2=ohnzV_sPjxYxjvoSJyAZ5A) (PDF) despite people like you trying to change history. 














 This was fascinating. Thank you! 




 I'm still going to have to ask for a source. A family farm worth over $5 million may not be liquid rich, but it _is_ rich.

How many farms that qualify as small businesses and family farms are subject to the estate tax? 




 Inheriting wealth seems quite antithetical to hard work, personal responsibility, and meritocracy. It should at best be viewed as something we put up with for other reasons (e.g., property rights).

In fact, inheritance should be viewed as embarrassing. Those who inherit should have a much higher standard for personal success. 









 I'm dying here... 






































































































































 Hi, /r/charleston! My boyfriend and I are planning a quick one night visit and are looking for a nice bed and breakfast. Suggestions?

We are looking for something secluded and preferably on the water (marsh, coastal seaway, ocean). Relaxation is our goal so being near nightlife is not important. Oh, and gay-friendly is a must.

Thanks in advance! 




 I hope you're ready for your close-up, Augusta...

 I agree that it's not a big deal (I see it as I would any other drug such as marijuana). But it's not a good idea for law enforcement to break the law and enforce the same law. 




 I... don't think that's likely. 




 This seems... random. 300 people for the man who almost became President? 









 I'm curious then why my experience was dismissed as anectodal while the one I responded to wasn't.

Criticism is fine, but only if it is fair. When it isn't fair, it is "bashing". 




 Good point. 




 I think growth is more terrifying. 




 The "new" path? That is how the free market operates without proper oversight. 




 Well, I notice you didn't make the same comment to the anecdote I was replying to. As a proud LGBT Southern activist (on one local board and one statewide board), South-bashing is tired and not very productive. Minimizing my experience but not that of the commenter to whom I replied is a good example of how subtle it can be.

As for relevance, I responded to an anecdote with a counter-anecdote. 




 I live in GA (notably _not_ Atlanta) and have never felt threatened because I'm gay. 




 I will do a happy fuck you dance when I return my Comcast equipment. 




 Wait what does this mean at the end?

 If (name redacted) would like us to post the rest of the conversation, he cannot bring $15to the Metro Spirit office today by 3:00. 




 The planet is not your private domain. 




 I think "consumers" is the best response so far (and what your suggestion - potential Tesla owners - seems to imply). But I don't think Democrats champion "consumers" as prominently as Republicans champion "the free market". 









 Demographics happened to Regency... 




 Wait - what does gun ownership have to do with Tesla not being able to sell directly? 




 That was a statement made by _his_ attorney, not any prosecutor. I agree with your general point though. 




 Even assuming that's true, is that relevant here? Who's the little man that the Democrats aren't supporting? 




 To be fair though, Republicans carry the free-market-above-all-else banner proudly and loudly, and more so than Democrats. 









 It's the other way around, my friend. 




 The Right to Personal Dignity/Privacy 









 Cynicism is not wisdom. 




 Of course I'm referring to race. You must live in that conservative fantasy colorblind world, despite all evidence to the contrary.

Do you not recognize the racial problem in our justice/political system? Because acceptance of that fact is Step 1 in this discussion.

As for your last point... did you hear about the rioting and looting at the Pumpkin Festival up north, and all the hooligans who were arrested, and shot and killed? 




 One of the major problems with the whole Ferguson situation is that the elected officials don't reflect the community.

So, yes, vote. Use the ballot box and elect your leaders.

This strikes me as FOXNews playing the race card race card. If you don't think there is an issue with race in this country (particularly between law enforcement and African-Americans) you just aren't fucking paying attention. 




 It just seems like a non-issue to me. I don't see it as being a good or a bad/cringy thing. 




 Actual gay uncle with no kids checking in. It may well be more of an individual proclivity and not a in-born thing but I do have a very strong desire to support by brother's and sister's children in any way possible.

Whether I have kids myself is still an open question. But until I do, I try to divert my resources their way as much as possible.

I suggest it may be an individual thing because I love both my siblings. Were there bad blood, the desire to help their children may not be there. 




 Never been to Atlanta, I see. Homo-mecca. 




 If by "pretty large" you mean "one of the largest in the U.S.", yes. 




 Broadly, yes. But the Constitution was a refinement of the Articles of Confederation. And the Commerce Clause was specifically intended to help improve upon the Articles by giving the federal government more authority.

The Commerce Clause was designed to make the federal government more powerful. You and others not understanding that doesn't make it any less so. 




 If I come in during posted business hours and get turned away or am given a shitty attitude, I just don't ever return.

Simple as that. 




 Why is it noteworthy she liked her own status? 




 Um, no. Way to let hyperbole completely take attention away from any validity your point may have.

The Commerce Clause + the Necessary and Proper Clause do vest the federal government with broad authority, but not absolute authority.

The intent was to give the national government a level of authority over the national economy. Naturally, if the national economy grows, so will that authority. 




 I've met those who _claim_ to care more about corporate welfare (such as yourself). But actions speak much louder on this point.

And why can't a liberal complain about vitriol? Not a single person encompasses the boogey-liberal-man you're apparently terrified of. Also, I didn't excuse Holder of anything.

You seriously have issues, my friend. 




 The national economy is _much_ more interconnected than it was at the Founding. I personally think the clause is currently interpreted correctly. 




 I think it's the other way around. The ANGC probably wouldn't notice if the hotel isn't open by April, but the Partridge Inn definitely would. 




 How _you_ doin'? 




 Voter turnout. 




 What in the world are you talking about? 




 Serious class hatred going on with you... 




 Yup. If I ever meet a libertarian who is more concerned about corporate welfare than human welfare, I might actually listen to what they're saying.

Until then, it's disingenuous and a cover for selfish greed. 




 Noble attempt but there's some intense astroturfing taking place in these comments. 




 That this vitriolic personal attack has positive upvotes tells me everything I need to know about this thread.

Good grief, people.

 For the love of God don't give the reigns to the GOP. They seem to be too often blinded by budgetary hubris. 




 Jokers usually work outside the normal rules so it works well, I think. 




 It's ridiculous to claim employers and employees have equal leverage when negotiating, particularly with high unemployment.

A UBI would even that out that a good bit though. 




 I don't see this as necessarily hypocritical. If any one business in a market voluntarily raises it, that business is at a competitive disadvantage. The minimum wage levels the playing field.

A big element of the value of having a minimum wage is that it is required of _all_ businesses (particularly competitors). 




 Wet wipes. Dry is for cavemen. 




 Well, considering you have no idea who I am or what I do, the same insult seems to apply to you. 




  Ultracrepidarian

Is this an insult or what? 




 I think it's a diplomatic tactic to take advantage of inevitable sensationalism. 




 We're not talking ethics, we're talking accounting. Math is math - there's no "agreeing to disagree".

You might view it differently politically, but a tax deduction still costs the government money (just as if they were to eliminate the student loan interest deduction and send you an equivalent check every year). 




 Yes, I have. Quit being a condescending prick.

To bring up an example you used elsewhere in this thread...

There is zero practical difference between the government telling me to keep $20 more of my income and the government taxing me as usual but sending me $20. It reduces the amount of money in the government coffers exactly the same (and increase my money exactly the same).

Whatever amount of money you got to keep because you took the student loan interest deduction can just as easily be viewed as a check from the government. 




 A deduction based on student loans is giving me something I wouldn't have had otherwise, not allowing me to keep something I already have. It's essentially the government taking taxes from other people and using it to offset my liability.

Edit: And how many people does it take to remind you to vote? 




 Yes, they are "welfare". What else would it be? Magic free money? 




 Wait don't we subsidize the crap out of oil and coal? 




 Mot's is dog food.

Blasphemy 




 It's a very small segment of the community that votes. You have to buy a magazine (or have a subscription) because the ballot is inside an issue. Basically the Hill and no one else.

  I'd be surprised if Ebola ever makes it to America, honestly.

 The panel opinion suggests that obtaining a photo ID to vote cant be a big deal, because one needs a photo ID to fly. Thats a common misconception. See Transportation Security Administration, _Acceptable IDs_, www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/acceptable-ids. Since, despite the 9/11 attacks that killed thousands, a photo ID is not considered essential to airline safety, it seems beyond odd that it should be considered essential to electoral validity. 




 _Read_ the goddamn opinion. Judge Posner addresses all these arguments. (Spoiler: Photo ID is _not_ always necessary to purchase a gun.) 




 I counted up to the level all four had in common (11), multiplied by 4, and then added the 3 loners.
 




 The thing is... when you start thinking this, you've already started believing it. Because everyone younger than me is stupid. 




 So the top comment in a thread asking what websites don't show up on Google... is a website that is literally Google? 














 If this is the same thing that was recently reported, they would hold the person down and stick fingers in his butthole and then into his own mouth. 




 How many white people don't have a birth certificate? Many elderly black people don't because it wasn't common during segregation. 




 The reward is nonexistent so the risk is still higher. Unless it's a coordinated effort, it just doesn't make sense to do.

And I've never seen any evidence of individuals doing it in any meaningful numbers, and not even one bit of evidence that it happens in a coordinated fashion. 




 And chemically castrated by the UK government for being homosexual, despite being instrumental in defeating the Nazis.

He was recently pardoned posthumously. His homosexuality and persecution should always be remembered. 




 This tactic is such crap. _You_ are implying minorities are not _smart_ enough or whatever to get ID. No one else is. The issue is how difficult it is (e.g., driving long distances, taking off work). 




 What's the incentive? Eligible voters already bitch that their vote is meaningless. Why would someone risk serious jail time for one additional meaningless vote?

It doesn't make sense. It's all about preventing Democratic-leaning voters from voting. 




 It is... but that's why most individual rights are protected by the federal government. Those 3 appellate judges don't give a shit what happens in Columbia.

Great info, too! 




 Minor bump in the road. The highest court that will hear the federal case (the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals) struck down Virginia's ban.

SC officials are simply wasting time and money. It's very disingenuous for anyone with knowledge of the legal system to throw up their hands and say, "But who knows how this case will be decided".

We know exactly how it'll be decided, because the highest court that will hear the case already did. 




 Hmm. We should get a lemur. 




 Based on your logic, he could have married his sister prior to today. What exactly is the point of this statement? 




 Unexpected but good. Voter ID laws at best are a solution looking for a problem. At worst, well, politics. 




 Two muscle bears fucking is pretty manly. 




 To you. Simply because you don't understand the problem doesn't mean the problem doesn't exist. 




 Charleston and Columbia are now issuing same-sex marriage licenses!

Any N. Augusta or Aiken couples planning on heading to Columbia? 









 Anyone who listens to music without headphones is King Douchebag of Everygym. 




 I would love to see this group grow and really help develop Augusta's tech industry, particularly with the introduction of the Cyber Command. 









 The statement from the representative does not indicate they sent it via regular mail as well. 




 As this decision* will lead to the invalidation of South Carolina's same-sex marriage ban, I think posting this in /r/Augusta is appropriate.

*Changed "ruling" to "decision", after 4 net upvotes. 



















 Yes. 




 Probably. Best practice is to send an important document via certified mail and regular mail. 




 I'm a lawyer and own my practice. I will hire more employees when my caseload increases (i.e., when there is more demand).

Cut my taxes and I'll just have more money. 




 Carolina Ale House? Although if you don't like Buffalo Wild Wing, I don't imagine you'd like it.

Somewhere in Augusta is local. 









 The drawing style is incredible. 




 I just point out that there are two religion clauses in the 1st Amendment: the Free Exercise Clause (the "of") and the Establishment Clause (the "from"). 




 At some point in the past I read in what I remember to have considered a reputable source that the "greying" of Presidents has a lot to do with the age window men are most likely to be in when they assume that office. 




 The weirdest part is I don't think many people thought this would happen again so quickly. I'm 32. I very clearly remember 2003.

I guess I thought the memory loss was a generational thing. Nope. Much quicker. 




 Yeah my first time was not, um, porn-worthy. 




 Even in death, he leaves his mark. 




 That seems to me how it boils down. 




 I think it may be dodgy wording. Currently, the property is tax exempt and I think the question is whether that should continue if operated by private companies.

Never trust how a ballot measure is worded. 




 Oops - thanks for that. Autocorrect strikes again. It should be "continue". 




 hell, just look at the comments section on any political article on Augusta Chronicle!

Ain't that the truth (this article included). 




 The ballot language is as follows:

Shall property owned by the University System of Georgia and utilized by providers of college and university student housing and other facilities continue to be exempt from taxation to keep costs affordable?

I am extremely skeptical of the privatization trend and was shocked to learn that this seemingly innocuous proposal was part of a larger dorm-privatization plan.

I'm voting "No". 









 Very difficult because it is hard to rebut someone saying they forgot or were mistaken.  




 Well, no pressure or anything, right? 




 I completely understand that. But the issue is whether China's cooperation with South Africa is so essential that the decision to cancel the event can justifiably be characterized as a decision in name only ("You can't really blame the SA government.") 




 Right, that's it's a pressure. But it's not a live or die pressure, which would certainly take precedence. (I read your post as implying that it was live or die.) 
























 Done :)

 "You have violated my religious rights."

That is fucking absurd and everyone's reaction should be "that's fucking absurd." 




 I did not know this. Thank you. 




 I've never had any luck getting my phone to act as a wifi hotspot (but then again I'm not that tech savvy). 




 Nothing that is noticeable enough to come to mind. It does seem to hog the connection though, rendering tablets and other devices struggling to reliably connect. 




 Good point and I think you're right about that. I was primarily referring to travel where I stay with family and friends (I don't do much hotel traveling). 




 Yeah that was intense. 




 I have one on all TVs and am considering getting one for travel. They are pretty much an integral part of how I access my digital media: Netflix, HBOGo, Google Play Store, Google Music, YouTube, multiplayer games, Photos, etc. You can also mirror any Android device.

It's a luxury in the sense that it's not necessary or anything, but that can be said about most things we buy. Chromecasts are affordable and pretty awesome.

For $15? Go for it. 




 Hot cop is best cop. 




 I think that's the entire point here... if the first people to get here can't claim any right to the land, how can the European settlers? 




 O_O 




 Sweet. Let's turn Georgia into a mecca for marijuana and pass a joint all the way to the bank. 




 I don't think it's a stretch to compare social mobility in Western countries. America doesn't exist in a bubble. 




 He said it was supporting evidence, not sufficient evidence to prove it. Minor but important distinction. 




 I don't think I've ever seen the colored "2 days left" feature before. 




 That getting an indictment is easy if the prosecutor wants one. 




 Would diving through the wave even remotely work? It was fairly narrow. 









 This is my first experience with the actual hive mind. That was today, right?  




 I'm not basing this just on the President. I'm basing it also on *the Republican-led committees*. All *seven*. Not everything bad that happens is the result of ill intentions. Sometimes shit happens and mistakes are made. All evidence in this matter indicates that's exactly what happened here.

You're basing your position on your own assumptions, and that's it. 




 No they weren't. All an executive order is is a directive from the CEO (the President) to his employees (executive branch government employees). Nothing nefarious.

On the immigration issue, I'm not certain but I bet he's exercising prosecutorial discretion to tell U.S. Attorneys to stand down on certain deportations. And prosecutorial discretion is not a radical concept either.

Edit: For the downvoter...  An [Executive Order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order) apparently is not what you think it is. 




 Totally nothing to see here folks! 

You forgot your source: the Republican-led committee.

And again, why are you assuming the worst motive? Everything you wanted to be true about this conspiracy has failed to materialize. So why can't you accept the fact that you might also be wrong on this as well?

Is it because you've made up your mind and want to attack the President, facts be damned? 




 Yes, they do. When a government employee does something in their official capacity, they are generally held to whatever government standard is applicable.

And it has nothing to do with a chain of command to me as a taxpayer. It has to do with the government being required to follow certain rules.

Short of security concerns, the government generally cannot prevent the press from reporting on its activities. That may (or may not) be applicable here.

But the fact that they are government employees is extremely relevant. 




 Conflicting reports don't mean you have to sit on your hands and not make an assessment about what happened. That's what they did. No conspiracy. Get. Over. It.

And I'm relying on Republican-led committee reports. You are the one who refuses to change your mind in light of a massive amount of evidence suggesting you should. 




 Or they were just making their best assessment at the time given the information available.

Look, y'all have beaten this Benghazi horse to death and found nothing to support your crazy conspiracy theories. At this point, why insist on assuming the worst possible motive? Seven committee investigations now strongly suggest doing so is unreasonable. 




 I agree he's talking tough, but I'm skeptical whether he will follow through.

And Congress is undoubtedly more powerful than the President legislatively but that doesn't mean Congress should legislate in bad faith or that the President is powerless. If they try shenanigans (such as tacking a law to refund Obamacare onto a bill to fund the government) he needs to call their bluff. 




 Did you even read the article? The committee found that there were conflicting intelligence reports about the cause of the attack. 




 No matter how many times Benghazi is proven to not have been a scandal, you'll never let it go, will you?

Too much invested in it, I suppose. 




 While true, you will always run up against things like the First Amendment when dealing with the government.

They are customers, but they're also government employees. 




 So when you said we elect people based solely on merit, you meant "but only in the last few decades"? Doesn't seem as lofty with that qualifier (particularly because the same can be said with regard to race, religion, sexual orientation, etc.) 




 As a liberal Democrat, I agree. Defense always loses.

Obama needs to respond with force. Start pounding the GOP in the media NOW and don't stop. Call their bluff and stand firm: your bad-faith legislation will be veto'd and you will shut the federal government down. 




 Isn't that the point? NOT to act like the psycho murderer? 




 You probably could have received the same deal, but you wouldn't have known to request it. One of the primary advantages of hiring an attorney is that you are hiring someone who is very familiar with the system and how to navigate it. 




 "Augusta was recognized in an annual survey by the Center for Digital Government, a California-based national research and advisory institute on information technology policies and best practices." 









 How on earth can you make such a statement based off one anonymous internet post?

You went from zero to drama queen... 




 You don't think gender plays a role in who we elect as President? Forty-four consecutive males is not statistically likely if the contests are truly blind to gender as you suggest. 




 Civil law judges are considered less powerful than common law judges. The roots of the French civil law system include a reaction to the powerful judges prior to the French Revolution who protected the aristocracy.

Importantly, civil judges generally cannot invalidate legislation. This alone makes common law judges much more powerful. 




 Is it what I'm thinking of? Overgrown and looking like something out of Walking Dead? 




 The downtown is subpar relative to Greenville, I'll agree. But it's not bad on its own. I work and play mostly downtown and love it.

Have you been to Craft   Vine? That is a great bar. So is Bee's Knees. There's some room to grow but we definitely have some good bars.

I will have to completely disagree about the restaurants. Frog Hollow was singled out by GQ magazine as a must visit restaurant. And if we are extending out beyond downtown (which I don't think your original complaint was limited to downtown), there's Oliviana's, Fifth and Finch, Tako Sushi, Manuel's, Calvert's, La Maison, and 5 O'clock Bistro. Augusta is known for having many restaurants because of Masters week: many can make enough that one week to survive all year.

I'll also have to strongly disagree about the outdoor aspect. We host the largest Ironman in the country, are the home of disc golf, have a nice river and a canal, great bike trails, and generally pleasant weather. If you think Augusta isn't an "outdoor town", I suggest you're not taking advantage of what it offers.

As for live sporting - I'll agree except for the GreenJackets. But I see that as a function of size. How many cities our size have a lot of live sporting options? Ditto for live music.

Finally, as an unmarried professional, Augusta is overflowing with dating opportunities (and I'm a gay man which limits the pool significantly). Granted, I'm in a three year relationship but am involved and attend SO many things for the young professional crowd and EVERYONE is single.

Overall, my view is that your attitude plays a big part in all this. If you think Augusta sucks, you'll focus on the negative and Augusta will suck. But if you focus on the positive, you will see a city exploding with new and exciting things.

I love it here, and can back that up quite easily. 




 Do you mind being specific (as to "a lot to complain about" and "doesn't compare to many other cities this size")?

The tone of this post and your original one are quite different. If you agree about Augusta being an objectively nice place to live, why would you pity someone who is moving here? 









 Try Auben Realty for housing. They are local and do a great job.

For live music, Sky City will likely be your venue. Whiskey Bar, Stillwater, Craft   Vine, and Bee's Knees are a few of the great bars downtown (off the top of my head).

As for touristy stuff, there's the canal and the river. I personally love all things canal but you're arriving in the winter so it won't really be accessible for a few months. 




 OP, don't listen to folks like this. Augusta has a large melancholy band of pessimists that poop on everything about Augusta.

The area is objectively nice: good climate, good economy, cheap standard of living, access to outdoor activities, plenty of restaurants, etc.

Plus we just built the first new nuclear reactors in the country and are now the home of the U.S. Army's Cyber Command (fun tech development).

Welcome and I hope you enjoy our city! 




 If it's a jobs program, let's call it what it is. 




 I pretty much agree with your entire analysis but question where the line is. First Amendment freedom of speech is a political and legal right, and it should be.

Private freedom of speech can't be political or legal, or you quickly run into enforcement problems with the First Amendment.

So is it social pressure? That's seem to be all that it can be. And that is almost by definition lacking in consensus. But if there is consensus, like: Black people are worse than white people simply because they are black, can't a position win?

We value the free market of ideas *in search of the truth*. If it leads us to that truth, why tolerate the falsehood? 




 I disagree. The will of the people - as a whole - is best expressed during a Presidential election because everyone gets to vote for the candidates. There are 435 House races and 33/34 Senate races during each midterm election; it is hard to determine whether voters in those races were voting for or against any person other than those in each race (such as the President).

The recent election was certainly a Republican win. But it did not represent the will of the people as far as the President's policies are concerned nearly as well as the 2012 election did. 




  Freedom of Speech, as an idea, ... almost certainly covers any kind of institutional or mob-based attacks against speech

Source? At least in the United States, it refers almost exclusively to government attacks against speech.

Edit: How would a private right of free speech even work or be enforced? If I disagree with someone's racism and therefore refuse to do business with them, am I to be somehow forced to do business with them so as not to violate their private freedom of speech? Wouldn't that then be a violation of my First Amendment rights if the government stifles my speech to protect the speech of another? 




  Freedom of speech is a concept which can be extended to anyone trying to suppress speech.

Is it though? At least in America, it almost exclusively refers to the First Amendment version, i.e., no *government* interference.

I'm not really aware of any generally accepted concept of free speech that holds everyone should be allowed to say anything without repercussions from private individuals.

(Same edit from another post in this thread) Edit: How would a private right of free speech even work or be enforced? If I disagree with someone's racism and therefore refuse to do business with them, am I to be somehow forced to do business with them so as not to violate their private freedom of speech?

 Adding my anecdotal experience: smoked on and off for 15 years and have been smoke free for 3 thanks to e-cigs (don't smoke those either). 




 The veto power doesn't make him a king. But it does represent something of a People's Veto in the sense that the President is the only federal elected official who is accountable to every U.S. citizen.

Congress can't really claim to represent the will of the country like the President can. 




 The mortgage modification process is a joke in its entirety. The shenanigans aren't limited to Ocwen. 




 Didn't he basically ignore the multiplier notice though? I don't think Uber fleeced him, he just didn't pay attention. 




 Fairly certain I've ridden a dirt bike there. Weird/awesome place. 




 The President is also the only one in the federal government essentially elected by the entire country. 




 67? No way. 




 That's like saying if you are pro-Second Amendment, you are pro-forcing-people-to-become-gun-makers. In reality, there will likely *never* be a shortage of doctors or gun makers to that extent as long as a functioning society exists (because of market forces).

Edit: Another and perhaps better example would be attorneys. We guarantee due process of law, so if there is ever a shortage of attorneys, I guess we'd have to force people to go to law school. 




 OP is gay. Probably not friendzoned.

 For the way I use Keep for work, this will actually change so much. No longer will reminders be an everyone or no one thing. 




 I feel like I'm from the future.

 Nice try, NSA. 




 I said both are acceptable, which the article does imply ("some writers"). Either way, if enough people use it (e.g., ain't), it's correct.

 Both are [acceptable](http://www.grammarbook.com/numbers/numbers.asp) (Rule 11). 




 This problem is a lot like losing your contacts because you lost your phone: easily and completely avoidable. 




 I understand the sentiment but please don't lose patience with *supporters* of marriage equality. They only have to keep beating this dead horse because a good many people still continue to fight the advancement of civil rights. 




 Unisys 









 And with (1) you get to blame government red tape/growth. 




 the only reason Augusta even matters.

Hold up now. Ft. Gordon (pre-NSA/Cyber Command), SRS, Plant Vogtle, and the Augusta National might disagree. And James Brown. 




 I get all excited when I receive an actual letter from someone I personally know. These days they're more often than not "Thank You" cards but I still like 'em. 




 No, that doesn't help at all.

The comment you replied to has been deleted. What were you referring to here:

I am defending the Constitution of the United States of America and the fact that it sets forth requirements for voters.
Im sorry you dont like the Constitution.

 How many light years away is this though? We are looking into the past. 




 SCOTUS here we come... how could they deny cert now? 




 Is this the first circuit split? 




 The county clerks likely took an oath to uphold the U.S. and state constitutions so if any particular clerk wanted to issue licenses, they probably could. 




 The only real salient point is jurisdiction. A federal district judge in one state doesn't have jurisdiction over any other state.

Federal appellate judges have jurisdiction over multiple states, and the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over all states. 




 Why not just move to another country where taxes don't exist? Somalia might be a good choice.

Or do you enjoy that violence funded peace and security provided by the U.S. military via tax dollars too much? 




 A sizeable percentage of Americans actually probably would, though. 




 But the savings will accrue to the private landlord by way of a tax exemption. It's a direct diversion of taxpayer money to a private company.

If you're for privatization, fine. But private, nonprofit companies should pay taxes. 




 Be prepared. I've been practicing for 7 years and still get nervous (and older attorneys all tell me the same thing). Use your nerves as a weapon against being unprepared. You can stutter and fumble as long as you are prepared.

Other than that - practice. It simply comes with doing it over and over again. 




 If there's one vote that shows that voters had no idea what they were doing (with regard to this particular vote), it's:

**Georgia Referendum 1 - College Tax Exempt: 73% yes; 27% no**

What ideology supports extending state tax breaks to private companies? Certainly not the conservative one. 




 I think these are rare throughout the entire country. The Wikipedia entry states the first North American diverging diamond opened in June 2009.

 Yep.

Hold on, everyone. Augusta 2020 will look a lot different than Augusta 2010.

 Beetlejuice! 




 This makes me very happy for some reason. 




 Yes, I think they are real people in Columbia County (a post lists their names but I'm not going to link to it).

It's creepy to me because of the heavily implied "order" to vote for Republicans if you live in Columbia County. Also that the county is some sort of monolithic voting block. 




 I know at least one other person who doesn't support the minimum wage being increased to $10.10 because then they would be making minimum wage, and I honestly just don't get the mentality.

Do you want people to barely make enough money to live just so you make more than someone?

In other words, did Hitler fight for his country?
