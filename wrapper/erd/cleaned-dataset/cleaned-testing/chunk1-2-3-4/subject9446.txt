 Because 42 is the answer to life, the universe, and everything. 




 Great!  Thanks so much! 




 Awesome, thanks.  If it turns out to be a particularly nasty bug, I'll definitely utilize that! 




 And your recommended course of action would be? 




 Any chance you could provide a link to those forums? 




 A friend asked for help "fixing" their computer.  They claim that IE won't close properly and they can't open Trend Micro.

I was thinking I would run some antivirus/antispyware scans (AVG?), and I'm definitely going to install Firefox and plead with her to use that instead.

But I'm not especially adept at troubleshooting computers, and without more details, it's hard for me to know exactly what the problem is.  I'll be going to her place tomorrow to try and help, and I was wondering if the brilliance here at reddit has some suggestions for how I should proceed. 




 Dear Norway,

 My biggest issue is switching back and forth from Halo to Call of Duty.  Default Halo grenade button = default Call of Duty reload button

I generally end up wasting a good number of Halo grenades...  




 How are you dipping one solid into another?

That just strikes me as physically impossible. 




 Quite possibly my favorite Stewie quote ever. 









 HAHAHA!  I get it!  Because he's in a LIBRARY! 




 Not sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if he had a chip on his shoulder. 




 Getting robbed by a bank is a certainly a new twist on classic Wild West villainy...

Ohhhhhhhhh Yeah... 




 Ha, yes!  I blame Homestarrunner for this... 




 This one genuinely made me "lol"... 




 Don't suppress your doubts.  Don't run away from your doubts.  Embrace them, challenge them, and don't stop until they are satisfied.

The two rarest things in this world are a humble young man and a content old man.

Oh, and please don't use IE...

 That's easy, Digg started becoming semi-popular, and thus the asshole ratio spiked...

 These people appear to dislike each other... 




 I would choose a super powered narwhal.
Then when the other person came to kill me, there would be an epic narwhal duel.  And that would be awesome.

You can choose from the 23-inch version or the smaller 12-inch one... :-) 




 you should definitely do something in return, like fry some bacon for her or buy her a howling wolf shirt... 





























 *GASP*  It always eventually gets back to one!!  I'm SO telling all my friends about this...

 I eventually stopped playing the classical guitar because I just couldn't put up with the nails any longer...

I hated getting odd looks from girls and having to smile and reply, "Oh, it's okay, I play the guitar"

 How about that sideboob?  Does that turn you on?  Well it shouldn't.  Because that's my sideboob.

 I was homeschooled K-12.  My last two years of high school I dual-enrolled at a community college.  This enabled me to transfer in as a sophomore right out of highschool.  I got my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering in 3 years, and I my Master's in Computer Networking in 4, all with a 3.75+ GPA.

Thanks Mom and Dad for homeschooling me! 









 Damn, I want to know if it hit the boy or not!  There's a split second where the camera loses the soda-rocket (pop-rocket if you're from up North), and I can't tell if it hits the kid or if he manages to evade it.

Frustrating. 




 Exactly.  It depends on the type of pictures.  In most cases, no...but we should have a look just to be sure. 




 Get Ye Flask.

This is my favorite thing to say to bartenders. 




 I'd be in charge of setting up LAN parties to train and instruct the younger generation in the art of zombie warfare.
My curriculum would consist of the L4D series, and the Resident Evil series.
Allowed ages would be 10-17.  Sign up your kids now, before it's too late... 




 It's perfectly normal for girls to appreciate and enjoy this type of game play.  There's no reason to assume this makes you a lesbian in any way. 




 It's also for Computer Engineers.  I'm a CPE and a member at my local university.

It's kind of like a high school chess club...except all the nerds are 3-4 years older.

 Hey Reddit,
My community holds a "Senior Breakfast" for the elderly folk in the area a couple times every year.  For the next one, I've been asked to do some form of humorous entertainment (nothing too lengthy maybe 5-10min).  Now I've done some standup before, but not with this specific demographic as my audience.  So my question is, what do you think the seniors today would find funny?

Feel free to recommend specific jokes, online resources, etc.  Your thoughts are much appreciated! 




 Now with double-fisting action...

 I upvoted, but only after some initial hesitation.  With a name like that I fully expected a more significant and witty contribution. 




 You two should start a facebook fan page for this post.  Then you can double like it! 




 We vote during the refractory period.  It's quite simple actually. 




 Gosh you two, get a subreddit... ;-) 




 I found it to be rather provocatively brilliant. 




 Hi Reddit on YouTube

Well, I don't see what all the big fuss was abou...*\*impaled by narwhal*\*

 How the hell do you pronounce "Cthulhu" anyway?  I've been wondering that for years...
I always end up saying something like "K-Thoo-hoo"... 




 They should really seal that entrance. 




 Typo in the alt text.

And yes, correcting the author of a famous webcomic has given my life meaning and validity.  I can die happy now. 




 Yay...my post started a fight.  I can be such an unwitting troll sometimes... 




 It says I either show up in court, or waive the trial (aka, plead guilty/responsible and pay full amount)  :-/ 




 Yeah, I do feel I have a plausible explanation.  It was going downhill in the mountains, my car coasts ridiculously well, I was in the act of braking to slow down, etc.

So would I have to appear in court to take this route? 




 That visual made me chuckle.  Have a virtual kudos in the form of a orange cyber envelope. 
























 Aww, the author is pissed because Reddit never links his stuff. 




 I immediately thought of Anchorman.
Thank you for the happy thoughts. 




 These aren't the comments you're looking for.

 I'm not saying it applies to the OP, but his post spawned this rage induced loathing.  I apologize for being angry on the Internet.  This is a place for children and I promise to try and behave myself in the future.

 Feclicia Day + gaming related video = reddit shitting themselves in excitement and joy

MAYBE IF YOU KEEP BEING SO HAPPY SHE WILL COME TO YOUR HOUSE AND GIVE YOU A HUG!

Hollywood took a cool idea and screwed it up the ass.  Very disappointing. 




 I tried to upvote you, but reddit just gave me this error:

 CHRISTOPHER ROBIN!! 




 I could use a little virtual affirmation. Validate me Reddit! 




 My only point is more attention would be given to it, not that it would magically be cured in two days.  I was agreeing with the principle behind it. 




 Sad, but true.

Our priorities in this world are fucked up...  :-/

EDIT: Never  mind, the downvotes of Reddit have spoken. The priorities of the world are completely in order. 




 "This" needs to die a horrible slow meme death...
