 It would be fucking impossible to get Taco Bell at 3 am 




 I think you're on to something here!  The CDC *is* looking pretty dumb lately.  




 For all you know I myself am a stripper, or I have children that are and support them even if I don't agree with them.
I've got an idea; How about we don't project our personal feelings on a given subject onto one another, insisting the other is wrong and we are right? Deal?
*Hint* THAT is liberalism. Live and let live. 




 I find it very irritating how often the article referred to him as "the stripper".

There's nothing wrong with stripping, but that's not all he is. 




 Nope, those are the fallen angels.
Cass is somewhere in there. 




 The things I've seen working at my copy shop (copying depositions from lawsuits and court cases mostly) have left me unable to sleep at night. I've met a few of the defendants, and I never would have known otherwise what they are guilty of. If ignorance is bliss, knowledge is a burden.  




 The biggest thing I think he's missing here is that just because his friend or people like him may not have laid a hand on an underage person, but someone else had to in order to create the content he's "harmlessly" viewing. He didn't do the abuse, but someone with a camera has to in order to catch those vile images. This perpetuates the market for such images and videos. Other sick people are fulfilling a need created by these 60 year old white guys. Cut off the demand, the supply withers and dies and no more children are harmed.

Edit: phrasing 




 He makes it seem so effortless he might as well be doing the waltz 









 "The 23 Slowest Snapchats Of The '80s"
I'd click it 




 When i got the job offer for my original position it included a contract stating I would get a monthly bonus based off the store's income for that month. The percentage wasn't specified, but both myself and the business owner signed it. I've been with my employer for a little over a year and a half now, have sense gotten a promotion and 2 raises but have only gotten 3 bonuses totaling $200, the last one being over a year ago. We haven't posted a single loss since I've been here, and we just wrapped up our best month of the year. Well, I get my check today and...no bonus!! This is really starting to piss me off. I've talked to the owner about it before and all I get is "yeah, we haven't been doing very well. Not a lot of profit." But as the manager I have full access to our finances and I can see that we did *worse* those few times I did get a bonus compared to our lowest month this year! How do I approach this without calling my boss a liar or cheapsake? I really need this job but I'm completely being used here.


EDIT: Thanks for the advice! I'll that those wise words and see what I can make happen :) 




 "Don't mind me, sir. Just here to snake the pipes." 




 That is cool as hell, I'm personally impressed!

 This creates a lot of pressure to make a decision when I just want an apple 
























 I'm literally the only person in my family who isn't an addict of some sort, which has made me an outcast. If I want to spend time with my family, even if it's breakfast, drinking is involved. They drink and drive like it's a normal part of life. I've seen my parents loose everything, a large fortune, homes, 6 vehicles and have to move back in with my grandparents...but they kept drinking. Once at lunch I suggested my sister shouldn't be drinking and driving with my new born (3 weeks old) baby nephew in the car, and she told me to mind my business and she can do whatever the fuck she wants, then got a drink TO GO. 
Also, I grew up in a very physically, emotionally and sexually abusive household. I can never forget the things that happened. 

TL; DR:  my refusal to condone my family's lifestyle choices, and my mistreatment as a child and a teen. 




 As scary as potentially losing your ring is, that's pretty awesome!!! Nothing says progress like an item that used to fit comfortably flying off. Congratulations on your progress!!! 




 That's a good idea, I'll start looking for races in my area! I really thought I could run the whole thing but now I see that's not such a great idea. I live in Southern Louisiana so I'm sure I can run the whole Mardin Grass 5k next year, maybe more! 




 That's great advice! I can't imagine how nervous I'll be on race day, but I will try to remember to take it all in and document my time. And ill try to remember to take my time and walk if i need to. I really thought if i tried hard enough i could run the whole thing but I admit my expectations were a little unrealistic.  I've always dreamed of being a runner, so hopefully this will be my first of many races! Thank you for the advice!  




 Thank you for the concern and advice! I'm actually surprised to hear the program takes 9 weeks. For some reason I thought if I trained hard enough I could run the whole thing. Now it seems like that will lead to an injury that would take me out of the race all together. Thanks again!  




 This past summer I joined a boxing gym and fell in love with working out. I was going 3-5 times a week, started to get in great shape and felt better about myself than I ever had. But then I got injured and took some time off  from the gym. Immediately following that, I went on vacation for a week and did zero work outs. I came home with a terrible sunburn and sun poisoning, which kept me out for another week. I ended up being out for over a month. That was July, and I'm still struggling to get back into a routine, I can hardly manage getting to the gym once a week now. I've also gained weight, and I'm not 10 lbs higher than my original start weight! This is what hurts most. I worked so hard and it's all disappeared. My plan at the beginning of the year was to look better for this holiday season than I did the last. I just got married in February and wore a size 16 dress. My new goal is to be at a size 10 for my 1 year anniversary. 
The thing is, it's not even just about looks and dress sizes. Heart disease and diabetes runs on both sides of my family. I want to be healthy enough to live a long, fulfilling life with my husband and raise a family. 

To help cure myself of this, I just singed up for my first 5k. It's not much but I've never ran that far before. Given that I paid the entry fee, I'm hoping it will light a fire under me and get me back into a solid training routine. I'm so nervous but at the same time I havnt stopped smiling since I registered.

God, I hope this doesn't blow up in my face. I'm so tired of failing and starting over again.



EDIT: structure and spelling. 
EDIT 2: only a few people have commented so far but I just love how supportive this community is! Thank you all for the encouragement and advice!  




 Battlestar Galactia reboot. I can't count the number of times I've re watched it. 




 Dude, really? Is that entirely necessary?  




 Unfortunately this is completely normal here in the US 




 I'm just a socially awkward person, still new to reddit and asking a question. Didn't mean to bring down the quality of content, I was referred to another sub that is more fitting.  




 Didn't know about this subreddit! Thanks for the link, hopefully I can learn a thing or two. 




 Don't forget to hold hands and look both ways

 I never even enrolled into college mostly because I wasn't willing to go so far into debt when I know I could learn through autodidacticism. I realized I was into graphic design, so I got a job as a personal assistant to a designer and ended up doing a lot of her work. With that experience I was able to get a great job as a graphic designer and have been there for 2 years. Meanwhile, I take online classes at my leisure. I get certificates of completion if I pass the class, which I can use on my resume. 

I do sometimes regret not getting the college experience and wonder what I missed out on learning wise, but overall I have no regrets. Hard lessons learned are not easily forgotten. 


For those interested: I use edx.com and courseusa.com to take classes. The ones I take are free by choice, but you can pay for the class to get a validated certificate and credits. I'm currently taking an epidemiology class from professors at Penn State,  and  soon i am starting an advanced astronomy class.  




 "Start changing your life now. The time will pass regardless." 




 Do you carry them all the time even when you're not on your period?

Yes, and not just for myself but for any fellow ladies who happen to be without one in a time of need. I would give me greatest enemy a tampon if she needed one.
NEVER deny a woman a tampon. 
























 I known exactly what you mean, I recently gained 40 pounds and cried while getting dressed for Christmas today. I missed thanksgiving because I was so embarrassed  my weight gain. Today I felt defeated and sorry for myself but eventually I found something I felt mildly comfortable wearing and promised myself I would do whatever it took to make sure I didn't feel this way next christmas. 
Just make the choice to make 2015 different. You've lost the weight before, you can do it again, you just have to Crack down and commit to it.  




 Thank you so much for the advice. I used to track my food, like 2 years ago, and it worked wonders. I don't know why I never tried it again, but you're absolutely right. I'm just guessing at my diet, assuming I'm making the right choices, but I'm probably not. I'm going to download MFP tonight and start fresh in the morning. Thank you again!  




 Wow that makes so much sense I wonder how the thought never occurred to me before! Thank you VERY much for that insight, I'll look into that avenue more. 




 Actually I've been considering switching switching for some time now. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety  (used to be VERY prone to anxiety attacks) at 16 (11 years ago) and first tried Paxil. That made me so much worse. My self harming increased and I became more suicidal. My doc at the time took me off of that and put me on Lexapro. It worked well enough, and I've been too scared to try anything else because of my experience with Paxil. But I'm thinking more and more it's time to try something new. There are so many signs that say this just isn't the right thing for me. 




 Im a 27 year old female, 5'2". March of this year I was 185lbs. I joined a boxing club and was instantly obsessed. I was doing great going 3-5 days a week and I actually gained a couple of pounds because of muscle but I dropped a dress size and I was in GREAT shape, but more importantly I felt great about myself. 
I started this gym to try to help my depression in an un-medicated fashion but it didn't help, so in June I got back on Lexapro. Since then I've gone from 187 to 215. I've been at 215 for about 2 months now. I know the medicine is the main cause for the weight gain but I'll admit I'm having trouble getting into the gym for months now. Injuries, illness, I  didn't have a car for a full month, and my job kept me away so I got into the habit of just not going. Right now I go about once a week. I want so badly to go more but this is my busiest time of year at work and I just can't get the time in. 

I don't know if I'm writing this for support, advice, or to just get it off of my chest. I'm just so damn frustrated it's moving me to tears. I don't recognize myself in the mirror anymore. NONE of my clothes fit. None. I'm at the highest weight I've ever been in my life and I have so much work to do to get back to where I started this year it feels impossible. 




 I was at an indoor range shooting my Sig p226 and a spent shell bounced off the side of my lane and straight down my shirt. That's the day I learned ladies  shouldn't wear V-neck shirts while shooting. 




 Fuck. That.
Have you ever had a hot, freshly  spent shell fly down your shirt and land on your breasts? I have. Still have the scar after 5 years. 




 This might be a little long, but here goes...

My husband and I lived next door to an elderly couple, the wife was sick and dying and the husband was an alcoholic/drug addict/drug dealer. He would use and deal his dying wife's meds in his driveway or right in the street. We should have known there was going to be problems because he told us he's glad "a nice white couple moved in" because he's tired of "living next to worthless niggers."
One night soon after we moved in, he was banging on our door at 3 am saying someone was trying to break into his house. My husband went over there with a gun and made sure the place was clear but the old man kept him there till 5 am. This happened 2 more times before my husband just said "it's not my problem, call the cops".

Here's the worst night; my husband called at 1 am to say he was almost home from the rig. Shortly after, I heard banging on the door. Thinking it was my husband and he forgot his keys I opened the door without checking. It was the old man, high as hell and  holding a machettee, saying he saw someone in my yard trying to break into the other side of my house. I grab the Sig Sauer, call 911, and go search the yard, finding nothing. Cops get there, arrest him because it's the 5th similar incident of the day. He's sent to a mental hospital and his poor sick wife is left alone and evicted. 




 Inception and The Dark Knight. 
Fantastic soundtracks.  




 I relate so much to the second dog so much it hurts 




 My best friend in high school was horrified of butterflies. I always thought she was full of shit, till one day in the park one flew near her and she dropped to the ground screaming and crying. Took forever to calm her down. 




 My college roommate (also my best friend since 3rd grade) brought home a girl he met in math class. She and I became fast friends (im a girl). They fell in love and we became the 3 muksateers. He committed suicide a few months later. She and I survived because we had each other. Still best friends 7 years later. 




 The most beautiful game I've ever played and you captured it well! Great work! 




 Me too! It was amazing. He's amazing!. 




 *insert Harvey Birdman laugh here*
If I had gold to give, it would be yours. I love puns. 




 My husband and I were at a friend's destination wedding in the mountains a few years ago, and we got into an argument after the rehearsal dinner. Seeing as I was the maid of honor with a wedding to control the next day,  and it was like 1 am, I left him outside to smoke a cigar and went to bed. Next thing I know at 3 am and he's in my ear telling me to look up. I roll over, the room is pitch black save for the dozens of fireflies. He knew I'd never seen them before,  so he spent 2 hours in the dark catching them by hand, then released them in our room at the cabin. 

Next to our wedding, that was the best night of my life. 
























 Sorry but I don't think it would work. Think of the group Pussy Riot out of Russia. I hear that on news outlets regularly and the anchors say it without hesitation. 









 Meh. Probably a 4.
Two days ago I was laid off a month shy of my 2 year anniversary with the company and Im pretty deeply in debt from medical bills.
BUT I have a wonderful husband with a solid job that can briefly support us while I find another job. 




 Lol that is pretty weird, but hey whatever works!! I'm up for giving it a try.
Trying on jeans and standing in front of the mirror are two things that I do from time to time and they work in a really unfortunate way. 
The night I posted this my husband was working late and I did miss him, so maybe there's some truth to that. I'll let him know it's his fault ASAP. 




 You're right, one little slip up is not going to make me lose all my progress. In the past I always overreated to things like this in the past and gave up. I'm working on that.  




 Thank you, that's great advice!! I actually did spend some time on the living room floor doing double sit ups and push ups to feel better about it. I also logged it like you said, and it turns out it didn't negatively impact my day nearly as bad as I feared. I guess I just overreated. Tomorrow is a new day! 




 That makes so much sense, thank you for the advice! I'm definitely the type of person to go down the road and get a treat at the gas station if I remove everything from the house. 




 I'm having the hardest time with cravings after eating well all day. I've been logging everything I eat and following my macros on MFP. Today at lunch I even got a free chocolate chip cookie the size of my hand, and I resisted eating it and ate only my planned meal.

Later in the afternoon I started to break down and went to find the cookie where I left it. Luckily my coworker threw it away, preventing me from eating it. But as soon as I got home from work, the hunt began. I found some peanut butter chocolate leftover from Christmas and even ate some chocolate sprinkles out of desperation. All the while reading articles online about how to overcome sugar and carb addictions. I didn't put the candy down, I finished every bite while reading about portion control and overcoming cravings.

I'm afraid of logging what I just did to find out how much I threw off my day. It would have been my best day this week, but I completely screwed it up. What can I do to control and overcome these intense cravings? 




 Sorry for the late reply I tried to figure out how to find players on the website and I couldn't. Also I'm still very new to reddit and I have no idea how to PM but feel free to inbox me!! 




 I joined Chris   Heidi Powell ' s diet bet that official begins today, Jan 5th. You bet $30 that you can lose 4% of your body weight in 30 days. All the winners split the pot. 
If anyone is participating I'd love to follow you on the website throughout the month! 




 This is actually exactly what I'm needing right now. No judgement, just support. Someone who knows how this feels. 




 Fonts. Fucking fonts  




 "The best way to get over someone old is to get under someone new!"
No. Just...no. Deal with your shit, learn something from it, and try again later. 




 The day my best friend told me he was moving out of our house, I wish I would have talked him out of it. He killed himself in his new apartment leas than a month later. Turned out he planned it pretty far in advance but I feel like I could have saved his life if I had tried harder to make him stay. 




 Louisiana accents are never right. 
True Blood is like nails on a fucking chalk board in terms of bad accents, and north Louisiana looks nothing like that.  




 Constantly pointing out how much he hated drama, couldn't stand liars, and absolutely hated cheaters. I was young and stupid, he was older and hot so I believed him. He turned out to be all of that and so much worse. Cheating, lying, drug abuse, etc. 
I've learned that if someone has to constantly point out how upstanding their character is, the exact opposite is most likely the truth. Good character speaks for itself and doesn't need constant verbal reinforcement.
