 Lilly reads Melchio's SBB as an attack on your team so it fills your BB gauges. 




 My Darvanshel is 6*, still working on getting SBB (BB is 8/10)

Just sent you a request
 




 I sent you a request.

Currently I'm running either Thief God Zelnite or Guardian Darvanshel

Lvl 88 




 Thanks!  I guess I just wanted to hear that I'd get there eventually.  LoL

Still working on being able to take full advantage of FH and harder Dungeons.  I have decent units, I just need to get them leveled/BB'd/evolved. 









 Added you. IGN: Jaird

Thanks for the opportunity! 




 At some point does the Zel become easier to accumulate or do you just run out of units to fuse/evolve?

I have what I need to cover necessities but I'm almost ready to evolve my Zelnite and Darvanshel which will leave me basically broke again.  




 Oh, ok.

I don't have either of them, so that explains that. 




 What are the Bulbs used for?

I can't find any info 




 Thanks. I think I have enough other units to cover what I need so I won't be holding on to my duplicates. 

I could use the space anyhow.  




 I cashed in a bunch of gems trying to go for Darvanshel (Good news is I got him) and I ended up with some duplicate units.

Is it worth it to keep multiple copies of units or should I just feed them to their big brothers/sisters for BB points?

Duplicates I have:

Lucina (L) x2

Mariudeth (B)  (L)

Bran (G)  (L)

Ahvel (G), (O),  (L)

Lilly Matah (L) x2 




 Hello, I'm not exactly new to BF but I've kinda been winging it thus far. I need some advice/help putting together a squad. 

Here are my units (in descending rarity order):

6 Star
Wise Mage Elimo
Black Lotus Lunaris

5 Star
Fire God Vargas
Rakshasa Vishra
Axe King Mariudeth
Goddess Hatsune Miku
Goddess Emilia
Bolt Mallet Elulu 
Lightening Sage Bran
Crusher Uda
Cavalryman Sodis
Scythe God Alice
Goth Idol Kikuri
Magistra Lira
Inferno Queen Elza

4 Star
Great Thief Zelnite
Commander Weiss
Sage Bran
Thunder Beast Ahvel
Lead Engineer Garnan
Bahamut 

I also have a couple 3 stars that may or may not be relevant (I'm not sure)

Who should I be focused on advancing? Do I have what I need to tackle some of the bigger challenges/quests?  

I have attempted the Research Lab once and one or two of the Grand Gaia missions but not recently (before I had and 6 star units for sure).

Thanks in advance for any help you can give. 
 




 #imokaywiththat 









 Seems fairly self explanatory. 

Obviously natural Chicken Porridge isn't shelf stable and they don't have a cooler.

More than I thought. And more than I have resources to develop. Lol 




 Saw your request in game before I saw your message. Hope she helped! 




 Accepted. I have Lilly up for you.  




 Thanks!  Will do.

 Ok, thanks! 




 Which is the best dungeon for finding Metal Mimics?

Cave of Desires Lvl 1 or 2? 




 Finally got him to drop after 10 tries. 

Good news is I didn't have any errors or significant problems clearing the dungeon. 

Bad news is, it took me 10 tries and I got a Guardian. *sigh*

Ran this team:

Lilly Matah (lead)

Darvanshel

Elimo

Lunaris

Mariudeth 

All were 6 star except Mariudeth who is maxed 5

I alternated between Maxwell, Grah, and Darvanshel friends.  




 I cannot access this sub's wiki (the one linked above)

I keep getting an error: 

you are not allowed to do that
 wiki_disabled.

Can anyone confirm if this is a site error or just a me error? 




 Great review!  I always love reading your analyses.

One small error I noticed though:
Garnan In-Depth Look, third bullet from the bottom, the second sentence should read non-Elza, I believe.

With so many similar sounding units I had to take a moment and research whether there was an Erza that I didn't know about  :)

 




 Ok, thanks for that.  Losing access to them in 5 days was definitely going to impact my strategy lol

 Do evolution materials need to be max level to use?

Specifically, does Turbo Hydraloid need to be level 80 to evolve Tridon to 6*? 




 Thanks!

I'll let you know.  




 Hi,

I sent you a request.  I run Zelnite almost always and I need your Lilly for taking on Maxwell.

IGN: Jaird 




 - **IGN+ID:**  Jaird 8199519575

- **Account Level:**  130
   
- **Leaders:**  Zelnite, Ultor (for arena)
   
- **Looking for:**  Tyrant Lillly Matah friends for Maxwell runs
   
- **Active:**  Daily 




 I'm trying to put together a squad for Maxwell:

I have Zelnite and Darvanshel fully maxed and sphere frogged 

I also have a maxed Tree and Grah

I'm planning on taking a Lilly Matah friend (after I find one, looking for friend thread, I know)

For my last spot I was thinking of training up the Rowgen I just pulled, will he work or should I be looking for someone else?

Also, what kind of spheres should I be using?  I have all the GGC ones (except Black Lance), one Medulla, 2 Sol Creators, Evil Shard, Providence Ring, and the Halloween Spheres (both).  

I couldn't make the score for a Legwand last FH. 




 'Ryan? Yeah, he's a pretty chill roommate; only makes me wear pants when his parents are visiting.' 




 I have one. I doubt it'll happen again.  




 Thanks.  I was leaning more towards him anyway.  




 Who would benefit me more for FH?  6* Hogar or 6* Zellha?

I can evolve one this week.

 I caught Goltovah. 

I read somewhere that all mid-bosses are capturable. 

Today in Lucana's I ran into a Burst Frog and Thunder Crystal mid-boss. Of course I caught the crystal.  




 Accepted. Happy Hunting! 




 Awesome!! 
























 You made a commitment and you're honoring that commitment. There's nothing wrong with having loyalty but you need to be picky about who gets your loyalty. 

I understand you wanting to give him the chance to work things out but it doesn't sound like he's in a place to do that right now. 

You can't put forth all the effort. If your marriage is going to work you both have to work at it and it doesn't sound like he's willing to do that. 

Ultimately you have to decide what's best for you but after how abusive he's been lately I wouldn't give him another chance. There is never and excuse for that.  




 Just let it go. 

General advice: you need to let the other person know when you're leaving. Sneaking out without saying anything is not cool. 

That being said, hook ups are not for everyone. You should sit down and think about how this made you feel and decide if it's something you would do again. 

Personally I can't do hook ups, I need to be in a relationship to feel good about the sex. Everyone is different though and you need to decide for yourself.  




 I love it.

It's my favorite thing to do in bed. 

My wife asked me once how I'm so good at it. Answer: Enthusiasm!

I'm going to echo what one commenter said though about one con. Sometimes you get squeezed when she's close to finishing and it's hard to move/breathe. 

Of course, that's a little bit of a pro as well. :) 




 You told him beforehand there was going to be no helping (read, sexual activity) going on and then when he started anyway you told him no. 

Yes, he raped you. 

Just because it wasn't violent doesn't mean it wasn't rape. 

This guy obviously has no respect for boundaries. 

You need to stay away from him.

Also, please consider seeking some therapy for your experience. 




 I understand that feeling. 

I would love to know what my STBX is thinking/feeling. 

But when I can be honest with myself I realize it doesn't matter and knowing wouldn't make me feel better. 

Look at the possibilities:  either she isn't upset by the end of our marriage which makes me feel like crap or she is upset and then I feel like a different kind of crap wondering why we're going through this at all. 

The reality is that he probably is upset and does miss you but that doesn't make the reason for ending the marriage any less valid.  You guys have history and it's natural to miss that and be scared of what the future may bring. 

But, you can make it.  




 I'm going to agree with everyone else and say you definitely need a lawyer. 

Get in touch with the VA (since you're EOSing) and see what legal options they have available. 

My local VA works with 2 different law groups that offer free counsel to veterans. 

Additionally you need to start thinking about what you want after the divorce in terms of property and custody. Decide what things you want to keep and how much involvement you want with your kids. 

Knowing what you want will make it harder for you to be talked into something you're ultimately uncomfortable with.  




 You don't mention what the fertility issue is (and you don't have to) but his feelings may stem from that. 

He may be feeling like a failure and less of a man because he couldn't impregnate you. This could be causing some minor (or major) depression. 

Additionally, even though you guys have decided to stop actively trying he may still be feeling pressure to make something happen. 

He also could be feeling disappointed that there is no baby coming. I know it's the stereotype that men don't get excited about babies (or the prospect of babies) but that's not always the case. I'm speaking from personal experience here. 

Whatever the problem is, your best course of action is to talk to him. If he won't go into detail on his own, ask him questions (you can start with the possibilities I've stated) and see where that gets you. 

Above all, be supportive and don't make statements like 'you're a man, you're supposed to want it all the time'

Again, from personal experience, that helps nothing.  




 I am going through a divorce (yay, fun times) and while I don't think I'll be ready for another relationship for some time I do have some concerns about being back on the market. 

I have been with my wife for 11 years. Before her I only had 3 sexual partners. One was a one night stand, one was just oral, and the other was not at all healthy. So, I've learned and experienced basically all of my sex with one person. 

I am confident that I know what I'm doing with her. Our sex life is not the reason for the split. 

I'm a little worried about how my skills will transfer though. I know everyone is different and I worry that I may be stuck in habits that won't work with another woman. How much importance do you place on a first time with a new partner?  If it's not amazing are you likely to decide to move on?

Also, I question how my comparative lack of experience will come across. Ladies, do you find it a turn off that a man has had few partners? 




 When my parents divorced (I was 26) my father stopped communicating with me and all my sisters. 

I was (understandably, I think) hurt by this and I tried to repair the relationship years later but all the effort was on my part so that inevitably failed. 

I realized, though, that the relationship I had previously with my father was always guided by my mother.

Given your close relationship with your father I wouldn't expect you to suffer the same but you should realize that your relationship will be different, with both of your parents. 

Lean on your husband and sister for support and be there for your mom and dad as much as you can (without getting caught in the middle). As you've noticed, even with agreement, divorce is hard. 

They're going to have a tough time with it and you and your sister are as well. But, if you can all be there for each other then you'll all come through it ok.  




 I know how you feel. 

My wife (of 9 years) wants out and all I want is to be able to fix things and have my best friend and partner back. 

What's helped me feel (a tiny bit) better is being able to reflect clearly on our past and realize that she's never really been the partner I wanted/needed. 

I don't know if that's the case for you or not but I totally understand your feelings about wishing things could go back.  




 Thankfully I was able to realize that I was in a bad place and get help. 

My sister has been awesome helping me through this. 

I'm still working on forgiving myself for marrying someone who isn't nice.  I can mostly admit now that the way she treats me isn't healthy or acceptable and that it's not my fault.

Sometimes I can think that things will work out better for me after we're done. Sometimes, though, I get stuck thinking about what I could have done to fix things between us. 

I can't help feeling like a failure. 

It's ironic because neither of our respective parents are still married but I actually thought that we could make it.  




 I have been seeing a therapist which I think is helping a little. 

Fact is, I  was feeling really depressed and wanting to kill myself. I spent basically all of Feb in the hospital trying to feel better. 

And while I was there she called me once and never came to visit. I got to see my kids once because my sister was able to bring them to me. 

My wife told me after I was admitted that she couldn't support me. 

The fucked up part is that even after everything that's happened and how shitty she's treating me I still love her. 

I miss her and want to talk to her and be able to touch her again. 

And every time she texts me, even though I know it's just going to be something about bills or the kids' schedules, I get a little thrill. I'm still excited to hear from her even though she's stopped wearing her rings and she 'has no responsibility towards me as a wife anymore' (that's a direct quote). 




 This will be long, sorry in advance. 

My wife told me shortly after the new year that she wanted a divorce. In her opinion we are too different to ever work out and she doesn't want to waste her time working on a relationship that's destined to fail.

At the same time (earlier that day even) I found a text conversation between her and a coworker that bordered on inappropriate and definitely made me feel uncomfortable and jealous. 

About a week later after multiple conversations and arguments (and not a little bit of crying on my part) I found another conversation between them that was way more explicit and totally inappropriate. Basically they were talking about how they could wait to fuck when they had the chance. 

She hasn't really given me any real reasons for wanting a divorce, just want seems like excuses: We're too different, we don't like the same things, she found herself attracted to this other guy. 

Supposedly nothing physical happened between them. 

I just feel like every 'reason' she's given me could be worked on between us (through therapy as well) but she has no interest. 

I've been feeling really depressed about my whole life and trying to find ways past this. 

I've finally accepted that's there's nothing I can say/do to change her mind. 

We've been sleeping separately for a couple weeks now and I just feel so lonely. 

Some details people will probably ask:

We have 2 kids; 5 and 8
We've been married 9 years (anniversary in Dec), together for 11
Nothing has been filed yet, I have retained a lawyer 




 For the Earth Arena coming up I have:

Zelnite x2
Dilma
Ophelia

For my last spot, should I use Miku or Douglas?  I've heard Douglas is bad but he's 6* and she's only 5* 




 Yes
