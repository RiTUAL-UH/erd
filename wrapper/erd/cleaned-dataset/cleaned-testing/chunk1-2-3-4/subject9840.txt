 Air conditioning. Why is it so noisy and never the right temperature?! 




 I have a laptop with a 10" screen. You can make it full screen and I can read those on the train, but I generally don't like reading off a screen if it's more than 10 pages. 

Also I hate reading off my laptop in bed. I will usually print it off or buy it cause the laptop gets hot.  




 Did you get it? 




 I've got it. I'll email it through. 




 Haha wow how do they enforce that?  




 Yeah fair enough. I was thinking more of publicly available statistics, but of course the insurance companies would record those.  




 I don't think anyone actually records those types of statistics. 

Also, I was providing statistics relevant to car insurance, so I think this is relevant for that purpose.

I am not really saying women are better drivers than men, only that they are involved in different types of accidents. 




 Some stats from my state ([link](http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadsafety/downloads/accidentstats2007.pdf)):

* 2007: "More than a quarter of all speeding drivers and motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were males aged 17-25. In contrast, only four per cent of speeding drivers and motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were females in that age group."

* 2007: "Fatigue was assessed as being involved in at least 20% of fatal crashes. Thirty-one per cent of the fatigued drivers and motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were males aged 40 years or more."

* 2006: 374 male road deaths vs 122 female road deaths 


Women and men may have the same number of accidents overall, but women may have more smaller prangs than men but fewer big accidents - so claims cost less ([link](http://www.carinsuranceexplained.com/car_insurance_explained/men_vs_women.htm)).

 




 I agree with this. As much as people pretend like they are okay with a mental illness, they can't shake their misconceptions. 

A girl where I work told some people she had suffered from severe depression and was on anti-depressants, and I heard hush hush comments from people about it, saying things about how she wasn't stable. It was not done in a nasty tone at all, in fact more of a caring tone, but I still feel she is treated differently to other people. She is very capable of doing the job she was hired to do, and I don't think this should be on people's minds when it comes to her work.

 Computer Science! 

I started out in pure science and ended up veering towards Comp Sci.

I know a lot of people who've done IT and a lot of them have ended up working at banks and consulting, but a few are doing different things. 

Downside is that I graduated in a downturn period. Was really hard to find my first job. I went back to uni and studied more and when I came out again it was great! 

I also like how what I can do can be applied to a lot of different industries. As someone with a short attention span for one particular topic, this is important to me.

What I don't like is that IT is often perceived by business as a service, because in most cases that's precisely what it is. 

I love that I am in IT, and wouldn't do anything else given the choice again now. Now it's just a matter of finding a job I like too :)

 Night and Daycare 




 That describes my organisation exactly! I am going a little bit insane here. I don't think I will hang around for much longer in all honesty, but I hope to do something good while I am here.

I like your advice, and I will keep trying to focus on constructively moving things forward. I guess sometimes I have been a little impatient, and don't always understand management's decisions. I will follow your advice though and listen to my manager and other people who have been around the organisation.

Unfortunately, most of my peers aren't much help. I have asked them and a lot of them seem to have given up on improving the organisation as it has proven to be too hard, and just focus on their technical work and the other job benefits, like the paycheck and leave. I've become rather de-motivated lately, as my peers tell me to enjoy the pay/leave benefits and not to worry about the problems of the business. At this stage in my career I am not yet prepared to do that though, and I am hoping this becomes a valuable learning experience no matter what the outcome.  




 It sounds like you have a lot of really good advice to share, so I thought I would ask a question. It's a bit detailed, but I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to deal with my managers.

I have been working at a large government organisation for 18 months and am quite junior.

Although I'm technical I can see a major problem with the organisation (it is primarily a business issue but has ramifications for IT), and I previously raised it with the 2nd in charge (sort of like COO). I regret that I didn't have a solution at the time, as he asked me what I suggest we need to do. I told him that I would need some time to think and reasearch a solution. After I explained that I may offend my managers for raising it directly with him and not my immediate manager, he said he would send an email inviting me to sit with him and with the head of IT to discuss my ideas. 

After this meeting I told my manager that the 2nd in charge would like to discuss my ideas, and he said I needed to present to him first. I saw that as a good thing as it was a chance to get some valuable feedback.

However, since then I've moved to another manager in the IT department, and this manager would also like me to present to him first, and then if he approves I can present to my senior manager. After presenting to the senior manager, if he approves then I will be able to present to the head of IT and all the other senior managers. If they are all okay with it, then I will be able to meet with the 2nd in charge to discuss my idea. 

I believe this process is going to take a few months and it is quite frustrating, as this is just an idea (and hasn't been approved by anyone yet, and is primarily a business idea), and also the 2nd in charge has asked me to go see him.

I don't know what to do in this sort of situation. I know I can go directly to the 2nd in charge and say that I am still very keen but I have been asked to present to others first before I can talk to him, but I know that will annoy a lot of people. I have spoken to my manager to explain that it wasn't really necessary to present to all senior managers first before going to the 2nd in charge as it was more of a business issue. He couldn't give me a good reason why I had to and in the end said he would talk to the head of IT to see if we can just present to him. 

I just feel that they are putting up roadblocks for me and I am not doing this for me but because I really honestly believe that the organisation will benefit from this (and I have attended senior business meetings where they have raised issues relating to this problem that affect the work). The main reason that I think they are doing it is because it will probably create more work for the IT department, but I believe that if the business thinks it is important then that is up to them to decide and not IT.

I would just like to know what you think is the right thing to do in this sort of situation?

 




 I think you need optimism when you're really young. He will be brought back down to earth in time. I don't think you could get through some of the early challenges in life without optimism. Also agree that he has a lot to learn. 

I think business education is good for helping you know how to manage or run a business but not necessarily give you the skills required to actually produce an output. If he really wants to do these ideas, he might need to learn a second skill.  




 Just got home from work, and don't want to think about anything! 




 A dwarf walks into a bar and he slips over a piece of shit on the floor, he walks off thinking nothing of it.

So the big man kills him.

 Best schools/universities: The quality depends a lot on the teachers. 

University advice: Go introduce yourself and don't be shy asking questions in class, or talking to your lecturers. Pay attention when they tell you what the assessments are/how they are graded, and start working on them early. Don't worry about what other people are doing. Don't fail a subject more than once.

Ways to save money: Don't buy shit you don't need. Food costs a lot - take your own food/snacks.

Getting a job: Just get whatever you can to begin with, then upgrade when you can. 

Can't comment on the other two.

 I'm not great at diagrams, but here's my shot at it: [http://imgur.com/INMR5.gif](http://imgur.com/INMR5.gif) 




 Check whether she usually wears gold or silver colored necklaces. Usually people have a preference for one or the other. I'm not sure what things cost there but I'm guessing 9ct Gold or white gold should be good.

If she likes stones, you can pick a stone in a particular color you think she'll like (sometimes jewellery stores arrange their pendants by the color). Otherwise you can go for something with multiple coloured stones or just a nice simple design with no stones or clear stones. You could also look at lockets if you think she'd like that.

Don't get plated jewellery. I think that stuff is a waste of money because it just wears out and then looks crap. 




 Yeah I don't know if it was because of me (my parents never made an official complaint because they thought it would make it harder for me at school) but the teacher left the school a year later. 




 At a school camp I fell into a ditch playing a game and broke my arm. I couldn't sleep because of the pain, and went to tell the teacher that I thought I'd sprained it. She told me to take a drink of water and go back to bed. I cried myself to sleep.

Then the next day a friend had a bandage so I put it on. The teacher told me to take it off because it was dirty. 

I didn't participate in archery or abseiling which is unusual for me because I love those two things, but she kept treating me like I was overreacting.

I got an x-ray 2 days later and it showed a fracture of the wrist. I got a cast and returned to school. The teacher gave me the dirtiest looks and hated me since then. 




 Haha I didn't notice that!

 Yeah that's pretty selfish lol. I mean she could even use it first and then let you use it, and if she really didn't want to use it after that, then she could throw it out and get a new one since a toothbrush is like $2. I hope she at least let you have some mouthwash. 




 Don't worry she might not like you but I love hair and bananas!!

 Their sheep string internet days are meant to be [nearly over!](http://www.digitaltasmania.org/news/14/58)

Although, they said something about Tasmanians being the first to get a [medical smartcard too back in 2004](http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/soa/Tasmania-to-get-first-taste-of-Medicare-smartcard/0,130061744,139154706,00.htm) lol. 

Recently I saw a news story about the fast Tassie internet. They were interviewing locals to see how excited they were about their improved connection speeds. There was about 2 people out on the streets in this tiny town, and they ended up interviewing an old couple who probably didn't even own a computer. 




 I'm worried that he was so specific. Is it okay for the dogs to eat a whole citizen, as long as they don't just take bits and pieces? They're not allowed to waste their food when dogs in Africa are starving? 




 I find the argument that a data mining system (and I'm specifically talking about TIA which no longer exists) produces false positives kind of poor, because correct me if I'm wrong, but false positives come up all the time in investigations. For example during a murder investigation, you would have several suspects most of which are likely to be false positives.

I think the real problem is the fact that you can arrest someone on suspicion of a terrorist attack without proving their guilt/intent like you would normally do in a murder/intent to murder scenario. 

In terms of data mining also, although it's impossible, I think it's a broad decision by US citizens - if you know that known terrorists have engaged in a particular pattern of behaviour, and that other terrorists are likely to also engage in that behaviour, is it okay with you if anyone engaging in that pattern of behavior is scrutinized? Keep in mind the majority of suspects are also likely not to be terrorists. I can't answer that question for you, but for me, if the laws around the system protected me from being falsely accused, and the information was only used for the purpose of identify potential terrorists, then I think I may be okay with it. To be clear, I'm not saying that these conditions hold true. 

The second argument that it's an invasion of privacy/risk of abuse due to free access to personal records is reasonable enough. But can't the FBI/CIA/NSA get this information if they choose to anyway? (I'm seriously asking - because I don't know). It sounds like this system just makes it easier for them through the data warehouse (the article actually doesn't say how they use data mining for this system). 

I can completely understand why people don't trust the government with their information, since some of the new terrorist laws don't seem to protect their rights and are open to abuse. Just like a terrorist shouldn't be able to take away your life, the government shouldn't be able to take away a suspect's livelihood based on a hunch either. I think it's up to law enforcement to recognise that statistical likelihood isn't proof. 

It seems to me that the problem isn't really the system and the access to information. But it's the fact that there is a large amount of room for abuse by law enforcement because of the laws relating to suspected terrorists.

 I started thinking... how could you not notice...

But then I remembered my cat is really fluffy too, and we didn't notice she was pregnant until about 4 weeks before she gave birth to a litter of 4 kittens!! My mum was getting a little worried about my cat's weight and my sister felt her belly and could feel the kittens moving around inside!   




 I'm in Australia. Most gay men I know talk like normal people. I don't think most people would even know they were gay. 

Of my good gay friends, only one of the three is outwardly and obviously gay. He does act a bit like a girl so I think his behaviour is more of a giveaway than the way he talks. 

There would be some people here who talk in a certain way but I am guessing that is their way of expressing themselves, and it might seem 'put on' but maybe it is just their way of letting their personality and thoughts shine through. 




 I reckon you could encourage them to go for another one, but if they really want it then just go with it and be there to support them. My dad never came to any of my games, and while I don't care now when I was a younger I took that as a sign of disinterest/lack of caring about what I do (since sport was so important to me). 




 I'd agree with this. I did a *lot* of sports when I was young, and sport can help you in all areas of life - socially, physically, mentally. You learn how to make friends, how to keep healthy and fit, and how to cope when you're under pressure, how to deal with losing, how good it feels when you do win, and how to juggle sports with school and other activities.  




 I'm not sure if this is the same with most pregnant girls, but my sister at least went into a 'nesting' phase to make the house ready for the baby. If there's anything you can do to improve your house then I think that could help.

Also just give her lots of hugs - I've heard a hug has to be 7 seconds or longer for you to get that good/happy feeling out of it.

 Yeah definitely. My blinds were shining bright red when I got up, but now it is more of a grey and just looks a bit like fog. 




 I keep seeing that in all the photos in the newspaper.  My guess is they don't realise it's dust. When I woke up I thought it was red because of a fire, and then I looked outside it kinda looked like weird fog.  




 I'm pretty sick too with the flu - I've been at home all this week. I've had a lot of trouble sleeping the past couple of nights because of my coughing. This morning, I went outside for just a few seconds to take a look after I noticed the red sky, and came inside and was coughing up a lung. 

I can smell the dust inside but I didn't think it was that bad... Staying home today though.

 There's a few different kinds of late for me. 

First, there's the I'm late because I don't care - this usually involves being at work on time. It's true, it's a direct reflection on the fact that I dislike my job. I do wake up and set out to be on time but just feel lethargic and take forever to get out of the house because I know what lies ahead is another crap day at work. 

Second, I'm late because I have taken on too many things. I did have a job once that required me to be at work by 7am and I worked every day til 7pm. I used to always be rushing and driving way too fast, and found it too stressful. This was more that I didn't get to bed early the night before because I had too much on my schedule. I was working full time and studying part time and just had trouble staying on top of my assignments, sleep and work. 

Third, I'm late because I've been held up. Usually I'll be heading out the door and something important comes up at the last minute. It's not intentional but I have to deal with it at the time. Sometimes it's only 5 minutes, other times its longer, but I really try to ignore things whenever I can. 

Fourth, I'm late because I'm disorganised. I really do plan a time to get to things, but sometimes I just suck. Once I was away from my place on holidays, and forgot to turn on the hot water when I got back, and I stank like cat piss, so had to turn on the hot water so I could have a lukewarm shower to get to an event. Other times I lose my car keys or wallet, because I can also be a messy person. I really hate the fact that I'm me sometimes.

Fifth, I'm late because I'm me. Sometimes I just don't feel like I want to rush. It's stressful rushing, and I will probably just feel like crap if I rush. I won't be late for you if you are waiting in an uncomfortable spot for me though. I may be late if you are with other people and you're not waiting by yourself. I am often late if you are waiting in the comfort of your own home, and I'm pretty sure watching the tv for a few more minutes won't kill you.

There's probably other reasons for other circumstances but I can't think of them right now.

Just wanted to also add, it's not personal or intentional. If I didn't care then I wouldn't plan to see/meet you, and I wouldn't bother continuing a friendship. I realise that most people feel that it is inconsiderate and so more often these days I make a conscious effort to be on time, but what's a few more minutes anyway...

 




 For the other experiment, 21 people doesn't seem to be a big enough sample size once you divide them into 3 activity groups. Interesting results with the mice though...

 Some heels are more difficult to walk in. If you're having trouble, steer clear of tiny heeled stilettos, cause you'll probably just look silly trying to walk. 
If you can find something you like with a bigger heel surface area that touches the ground you'll have more stability and hopefully be more comfortable. If you don't mind wedges these can be great.
Another tip is if you're having trouble walking is try not to go for anything too pointy, cause that makes it harder to balance too. 




 Don't show off too much. Like everyone else said, keep to one feature. Otherwise it just looks tarty. Also don't wear anything too tight, being able to see where your underwear is pulling folds in your skin is not a good look. 

Also skirts should be at or below where your thigh starts to curve inwards is a good rule. 

Be comfortable and confident. You won't look classy and hot if you're uncomfortable with what you're wearing and/or can't walk properly, or if you keep trying to cover yourself. 

 




 There's always something to improve in any house, so I'd just pick something and then learn the different ways of doing it. Repeat as many times as you like. Often the best way to learn about something is to fix something broken. I learnt a lot about toilet cisterns because mine wouldn't stop dripping.  




 I am too busy to look after myself, and when I'm not too busy I make myself busy cause I don't want to think about my problems, but then I do and I get overwhelmed, because I don't look after myself and I get run down. Right now I have a broken shoulder and tonsilitis.

I am actually happy today though. I'd rather be injured and sick than have to go to work :) Plus I get to sleep a lot and eat jelly! 




 What's the occasion? How much do you want to spend?

For a view of the harbour - in customs house - [Cafe Sydney](http://www.cafesydney.com). More expensive and you have to book but great food and awesome view for an occasion (make sure you get the balcony).

For cheaper places, I really like Newtown for Thai (Thai Riffic for a nice seating place or Doytao Thai for cheaper food).

Tony Romas near King Street Wharf is awesome for Ribs. Kinda like american food.

My favourite pizza/italian place is [Made in Italy](http://www.madeinitaly.com.au). I've never eaten at Pyrmont but I have at Wynyard. Wynyard is a takeaway place but the pizza was excellent.

 I'm just wondering if anyone has any comments on using XML for data transfer of small data sets between organisations? My experience so far has been good for this purpose and I haven't noticed any problems. The data comes from HP and Oracle systems and we load it into SQL Server.

Also typed XML hasn't gotten much of a mention here. I thought the validation of a data type was a good thing. Does anyone have any comments on typed XML? 




 The emphasis on sport in Canada sounds similar to in Australia. It's not really like the US. We do have sports teams and maybe some students get sports scholarships (not really sure), but it definitely isn't as big of a deal as I've seen when visiting the US. The point made by Anand999 about getting people to fund the university through sports doesn't really apply here.

 I tried this at my work too, but only had my crappy phone to take a photo with. You could see heaps more than without the tape, as in make out objects, but it was pretty blurry.

That is looking out of a meeting room into the photocopier room! The photo is of tape on the frosted side - I could see both into and out of the room. 

Tried putting tape on both sides of the glass (frosted and non-frosted) - this made no a difference to the level of distortion compared to when it was only on the frosted side.

Tried putting tape on the non-frosted side and that didn't do anything - I couldn't see in or out!

 I actually find this interesting cause I have also found that (in my limited experience) that most of the discrimination towards me has come from other women.  




 Yeah my first job while I was still studying was as first level support on an IT helpdesk, and clients would ring up and assume that I was the receptionist and when I explained I wasn't and I was there to help them, sometimes they would still ask to speak to 'one of the boys'. I'd have to tell them that they were busy and ask again how I could help them. The guys were more experienced than me but 95-99% of client requests I was able to fix myself. 




 Being punched in the throat sucks, but I don't know that I'd like being punched in the boobs/chest either. Are they meant to punch you there? 




 Yeah that's tough. I had a friend who was in a similar situation as you. Some of the older female teachers were quite unfriendly. What level of teaching will you be doing? 




 I am a female in IT. I chose this field because I enjoy it, and it turns out I am good at it. I am not concerned about the gender bias because I feel my qualifications and experience speak for themselves, and so far that has been the case (the only time I have been discriminated against it has not affected my career progress). However, I'm relatively inexperienced and I would love to know other people's experiences in similar environments. 




 I will read, and then if I am feeling energetic still, I will write a list of all the things I have to do the next day, and the thought of that sometimes makes me mentally exhausted and I nod off. Plus if you're like me and think about all your problems, planning out the next day gives you something else to think about besides the problems. I also find that coming on the computer usually makes me stay up longer, so using it right before bed is often not a good idea for me if I'm trying to sleep.  




 Yes! I hate it when people do that on travelators and moving walkways too. Those things take so goddamn long. There's a shopping center near me and they have one on every level. Drives me crazy going there. It's 5 floors but if I know I'm going to the top level I take the carpark stairs instead.  




 I would probably call a pest controller. Then you can try to seal up/remove/clear clutter from any places where they are likely to hide. That is pretty hard when they hide in garden beds though I guess, but hopefully they won't go in your house. 




 Well that is bad timing. Just don't do what this guy did and leave his trousers on the floor between gardening sessions: http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23002709-5013016,00.html

 I was in a hotel in NYC a while back using the net in the narrow hallway cause the hotel signal didn't reach my room. This random creepy guy came past and asked me if I wanted to join the "party" in his room (with one other guy). I didn't use the net in the hallway anymore after that.   




 We recently had our headlamps replaced in our Toyota 4WD with some crappy ones when they broke. I don't think they were a genuine part, or they were 2nd hand. We drive about a 6-8hr drive (each way) at least 2 times a year in winter to go down south on highways and so we have to drive part of the way at night usually (cause we are slow getting away). The high beam on the old headlamps was really bad - I nearly hit a few dead kangaroos because of this. We got them replaced again with brand new ones after some scary driving experiences and it was HEAPS better - I could see at least 10 times as far. Didn't need HID lights, and I don't know why anyone really would need them. Definitely recommend replacing with the regular lights first before trying annoying HID lights. 




 I thought that the sound of thunder was the result of giants bowling in the sky on top of the clouds. 




 Is the $3 for a one way fare? Our tickets just went up today too. I used to pay AU$9.60 or sometihng like that for a return ticket to work on the train from my parents (approx 25km), but now it's AU$10 (USD$8.96/CAD$9.41) return. 

Bus isn't much better. When I'm at my city place (approx 5km from work), it costs me AU$2.60 each way on the bus.

I feel so ripped off.  




 We have trains here (Sydney). Then after 1am or something like that, they have nightride buses for most of the major train lines. Do you have anything like that once the subway stops or do you get stranded in the city/downtown?
 




 I think the gang-rape thing happened once or twice, and it hit newspapers pretty hard. I don't remember it being like a common trend. Most of those guys got decent prison sentences for the really bad rape, but some of them got away pretty lightly. 

The beach thing that happened was really disappointing. I definitely think the media fulled that incident, and I think most of the locals disapproved but there are idiots everywhere and sometimes it only takes a few. I definitely think there was a problem there long before this happened, and I think there still is. I honestly don't know what the solution is. Most of the guys are just stupid teenagers/young adults and are showing off to their friends in the most intolerable ways possible.
 




 I live in Sydney too. 

I agree about the people being rude. It's amazing how lonely you can feel with so many people around. I live and work in the city, but it is a bit stressful sometimes and I miss the open space that I have at my parents in the suburbs. Even then it's not as nice out there as it used to be, since the bush is now all gone and new housing developments went up when I was a kid. I remember when we used to go to the shopping centre everyone knew each other and we couldn't go through without mum having a million conversations... I used to think grocery shopping took forever... but now I realise we had it good. It's not like that as much anymore. 

Sure there are crowds at big events, but then again you don't have to go if you don't like that sort of thing. There are quite a few jerks around that just don't care about anyone else's experience, so you have to learn a great deal of tolerance and not let it get to you, otherwise you can never enjoy yourself. That said, sometimes it's hard to ignore. I went out to dinner one night (kind of late - 11pm), and saw 3 people throw up in the street while we were walking to the restaurant (in the space of one block). I was kind of glad we were too late to get food from for the restaurant. If you are with a group of friends and can ignore it, the atmosphere can be great (as long as you know the best spot to go). 

With the immigration, I agree there's a problem there in terms of people actively not wanting to be part of Australian society. Obviously I am glad some people have cultural identity, and can feel like they belong somewhere, but so often I feel like some have no respect for any other race or culture aside from their own, and often do try to intimidate you so they can force some sort of feeble excuse for respect from you. It's not like that everywhere in Sydney, and I think you can have a completely different experience and quality of life if you live in a nicer suburb as you suggested. I think that's like a lot of large cities as well, and because I haven't lived anywhere very long term I don't know enough to say that other places are any better. I'd like to think they would be though.

I used to go surfing a bit when I was younger and nowadays I don't like it so much. I used to go to Cronulla (where the riots happened a few years back) quite regularly. I had some problems myself long before that incident. I don't like city beaches much anymore. Especially after finding 3 syringes in the sand on separate occasions. That all said I will still go surfing and for most of the time (not hot ones cause those are the days that attract the idiots), it is a nice place. Advice tho: wear thongs   don't build sandcastles far away from the water's edge cause the rubbish tractors don't clear the edges of the beach very well.  

I used to love Sydney because I thought it had everything - beautiful harbour, beautiful beaches, convenient local area shopping centers, good restaurants, good nightlife, multiculturalism, etc. - but as I get older and see more of Sydney I think sometimes I feel that the things I dislike about it are outweighing the benefits as well. 

I have really mixed feelings about this place, and so often I do feel like I hate it. I definitely want to get out and experience other places as well. 

 




 My biggest fear is making a mess of my life, and screwing it up so bad I will lose everyone and everything that matters, and will eventually die alone with my own self pity and regret. 




 Shakespeare had a lot of themes in his plays, like greed, guilt, temptation, love, hate, revenge, forgiveness, violence, jealousy, etc. Maybe if you can pick a theme that interests you it might be a starting point for some ideas. (Oh, and I'm not saying to do a shakespeare style play or anything like that... just to get some ideas).

Otherwise what would interest your audience? Or you? What's something you've learned in life, or a interesting event that has happened? Anything interesting you've learned from someone else?  




 We were out watching fireworks a few years back and after they end the city goes crazy with drunks everywhere. I saw this girl and guy fighting, after which the guy punches her in the face. Probably cause she is a bit drunk she falls straight from her feet onto her head on the curb, with no arm out or anything. I hear this loud cracking noise as her head hits the curb, and the guy walks off, leaving her with her friend. The girl was probably okay because I heard her screaming and crying after she fell. I saw some police nearby who are stopping people from going on the bridge. I walked up to the first one and explained what happened a few meters away and asked if he could call an ambulance. He explained he was too busy watching the bridge. I walked over to the other cop working with him who was clearly the more senior cop and he called an ambulance. Not blaming the cop they were probably overwhelmed but that was a weird thing to see. 




 I think this time she should get all the cash. Maybe next time half :P 




 Explosive Diarrhea 




 I have this (Lite White):
http://www.dairyfarmers.com.au/df/ourproductsandrecipes/milk/dairyfarmersbrlitewhite

I used to hate skim milk but I am lactose intolerant so I get sick drinking full cream milk now. But I can drink this and it tastes good. 

I should get a job advertising this milk. 




 When I was a kid, my sister and I thought it was a great idea to eat hot two minute noodles (including the boiling water) on the trampoline. It was decided I would get up there first, she'd pass me the bowl (which I held on my lap), and then she'd get up afterwards, and we could enjoy noodles and trampolining concurrently.

I burnt my whole right upper leg and spent a few weeks sitting down and having this white cooling cream applied to the burns.  




 The OP annoyed the Twatty guy, who got up in anger and asked the rhetorical question "Do you know who my father is?" as if implying he is a man of great influence or importance, and someone not to be messed with. 

By interpreting the question non-rhetorically you could assume the person really doesn't know who their father is. The OP uses this to offend the Twatty guy by responding with "No. Have you tried asking your mother?" and implying that the mother either slept around or was no longer involved with the father of the Twatty guy.

I'm not great with explanations but hopefully that clears it up. 




 You're welcome! Happy New Year! 




 Looks like you're there! :P 




 Most of my debt is from FEE-HELP/HECS. 




 The only big accident I've had was reversing into my sister's car from the garage cause the outside light was broken and my car is a bit chunky at the back and I didn't look properly. 

Then after this, instead of getting out to check the damage, I drove forward again to separate the cars and pulled out some pipe full of oil that my tow bar had got stuck under. The car was spurting oil all over the driveway. Oh god I'm stupid. 




 Read the news, learn about other ways of life, meet non-US born people and learn some of the other countries' history.

I think learning history will make you appreciate other cultures more, and the things they have done in the past and present.

Also I liked doing charity volunteering a little while ago just on a few occasions, but for the few days I did it, the whole time I was thinking about how little people in these other places had and how much capacity we have to give.  




 Thanks. That's both disgusting and informative. 

Wouldn't wearing socks mean your feet don't dry properly though and you would make the bacteria growth worse? I mean even if I dry my feet with a towel I like to let them air a little bit before putting on socks or shoes. 




 My cousin is like this. He wouldn't eat anything besides meat and rice. My dad used to always ask him if he was constipated. 




 Same with me. I couldn't have any type of cheese unless it was melted on toast or pizza. Then I was introduced slowly to all different types of cheese and I realised that there are a billion types of cheese besides tasty cheese and those cheese sticks which I still think are gross! 

I still don't like all cheese but sometimes cheese just makes a sandwich or a meal! :) 




 Did you get an invite? I have a friend who's been on reddit for 2 months but won't be able to join cause apparently it's too short :(

It sucks cause he's the one who introduced me to reddit, he just didn't sign up for ages! 




 I sent you something small to say thanks! You started something awesome on reddit! :) 




 They have a minimum length of membership too. :( 




 I usually find a comment that says the same thing I would say and upvote it - otherwise you would have 1000 comments that are exactly the same, and that's kind of boring to read. 




 This is awesome. Thank you! Merry Christmas :) 




 I just found this. Thanks! 




 State: New South Wales 




 Cronulla. They upgraded the STP back in 1998 - haven't had any more ear infections since luckily. It used to be the dirtiest beach water in Sydney before that. 

One of my friends mum's also used to surf and now has permanent ear problems from getting ear infections, so I'm glad nothing permanent has happened to me.  




 SMH:
[http://www.smh.com.au/national/skydiver-dead-after-13th-jump-20091128-jxz5.html](http://www.smh.com.au/national/skydiver-dead-after-13th-jump-20091128-jxz5.html)

I think a couple of people die every year out there. I would freak out at that particular place cause they get dropped out right near the highway. I've seen some guys get pretty close to the traffic. 




 Yeah I used to get quite a few ear infections before they upgraded the sewage treatment plant.  




 I've swum there! I'm still more scared of [box jellyfish](http://www.barrierreefaustralia.com/the-great-barrier-reef/jellyfish.htm) than great whites, because with box jellyfish:
 

 You have virtually no chance of surviving the venomous sting, unless treated immediately. The pain is so excruciating and overwhelming that you would most likely go into shock and drown before reaching the shore. 









 I think some of it is to do with attitude towards a problem. 

The bigger the learning curve the more fear you have I.e. the bigger the perceived 'hardness'.

Sometimes learning something new can be really hard, because you might not have all the necessary background knowledge or know the terminology, and so at first you don't take it in. If you persist with it long enough and get past this point, the result can be really rewarding. 

I sometimes think maybe people have found something hard, began working on it but not persisted long enough to get the reward. So the next time they see a problem, they have an even bigger mental barrier because they didn't feel the satisfaction from last time. If this is a problem, at least for me I found the best thing to do is break it down into parts and then each time you understand a part you will feel a bit better - trying to understand a huge problem in one go can be really demotivating. 




 I went out with a guy that smoked and I didn't let him do it around me. I didn't break up with him, but I still didn't like it.

I don't consider objecting to someone else smoking as being controlling - more that you care about that person and don't want them to get addicted, waste money or damage their health. In reality, I could never stop him from smoking - he could just do it behind my back - but I did tell him how I felt about it and in the end he made his own decision to quit. 




 * Like this magnet on metal we joining together,
So make sure you're there when we make it forever.

* You might remember this date in your head,
But to be safe here's a magnet with the date we will wed.

* We'd love you to be attending our wedding, 
So here's a magnet so you don't go forgetting.

* Put this magnet somewhere you'll remember,
The date we'll make our vows together!

* This invitation has a magnetic field,
To make sure you're there when we seal the deal! 




 Don't you get cockroaches or insects? I live in a unit - if I left dishes out the cockroaches would come from all the other units and infest my place.  




 I don't expect everyone to smile back or that they are necessarily depressed cause they don't smile back, but I like it when they do.  




 It's for the buses. You buy ten trips in advance on Sydney Buses, and put it into the green ticket reader box when you get on a bus and it reads the magnetic strip and prints the trip on the back (bus number and time). They've been around for a while but you didn't have to use them before.
See the [Transport Infoline Website](http://www.131500.com.au/faresandpasses/sydneybuses_travelten.asp). Looks like [this](http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/object3/1528/118/n91760107804_3407.jpg) - non-concession adult has white instead of yellow background. 




 Everyone poops! If you didn't paint her walls with your poop I don't see any problem. Besides that, I guess it's her fault if her walls are so thin she can hear.
 
I can think of a few things you can do though:

A) You can try turning on the tv or radio beforehand if possible. Then just let it rip. Flush it and act like nothing happened. Avoid going near the bathroom for a while.

B) Get her to go to the toilet first and then act subtly disgusted and pretend like it sounded/smelt horrible. Then she'll be so worried about how horrible her poo was she won't even care if yours sounds/smells bad. 

C) Show her how awesome the poo you just did was. 




 Friendliness. Where I live people can be pretty unfriendly, and I hardly see people smile... it's kind of sad. I try to smile at people (whenever it's not weird) and I really like it when people smile back. :)  




 It's kind of hard to notice things when you live here cause it happens so slowly when you're here. Here's a few things I can think of off the top of my head:

* The Harbour Bridge and some other places are now cashless. You need one of those e-tags to cross it now. I hate toll roads. 

* Buses around the city require you to have a travel 10 to get on/off buses during peak periods (I think it's 7am-7pm but I can't remember), so you can't pay cash to travel. I think this is probably a good thing but most people who travel regularly get Travel 10s anyway cause they're cheaper. 

* There was some stuff going on with Bikie Gangs which is still happening. They [bludgeoned some guy to death at the domestic terminal](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/30/2530292.htm). 

* The international airport (departure) was getting upgraded and had barely any food in the food court there. It sucks to hang around at before a flight. [Due to finish 2010](http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/sacl/International-Terminal---Expansion-and-Upgrade.html).

* If you're already in Australia this won't make any difference but here anyway - 
[Utility costs have gone up](http://www.switzer.com.au/latest-news/news-stories/record-lift-in-utility-charges-proves-inflation-bogy/): 
Utility charges rose by a record (37 years) 10.2 per cent in the September quarter. Utility charges rose by 13.4 per cent over the year  the biggest increase in 26 years.

* Pitt Street mall is going through an upgrade. Not a very pretty sight at the moment (not that it really was before).

* RTA penalties for speeding have changed a few times now. P platers have zero alcohol limit now, and there are some new anti-hoon laws. 

* More and more school zones have flashing lights now when it is 40km/h

* God damn birds! I used to open my balcony window in the mornings, but the miner birds are trying to nest, and a pair flew into my unit (I'm on the 4th floor), as did a pigeon. Pigeons at least are pretty predictable and so that one just kept flying at the window trying to get out. I caught it with a towel and let it out. Then a few days later some miner birds flew in and were scared shitless of me, so shitless, they shat all over my unit. I had bird poop everywhere. This, along with the time a turkey tried to steal my lunch, now mean I only like some birds. 
 




 I hate cyclists mainly because of their outfits. How streamlined do they really need to be? I want to hold my food down. 




 Thanks for this article. I heard so many different opinions and didn't really understand what was going on. It makes more sense now.  




 From the Telegraph: [link](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/grant-edward-brown-refused-bail-after-being-charged-with-unprovoked-attack-on-circular-quay-to-manly-ferry/story-e6freuy9-1225798655514)

**Grant Edward Brown refused bail after being charged with unprovoked attack on Circular Quay to Manly ferry**

*November 17, 2009 3:31PM*


A PERSONAL trainer accused of striking a 70-year-old man in the head in a bout of unprovoked violence on a Manly ferry has been refused bail for the protection of the community.

Grant Edward Brown, 31, was charged with recklessly wounding after the incident on the Queenscliff ferry shortly after it left Circular Quay at 6pm yesterday.

Police allege Brown, visiting from Tasmania, struck John Edward Lane once to the face, causing him to fall heavily and his head hit the ground.

Documents tendered to Central Local Court this afternoon have revealed Brown was allegedly talking loudly and aggressively on a telephone shortly before the incident.

To the unknown person on the phone, Brown allegedly said: If someone on this ferry gets their head punched in, it will be on you.

A short time later, he was allegedly acting aggressively, kicking walls and bins before a companion of Mr Lanes then alleged approached him and told him to calm down.

He refused, threatening to bash your head in.

When Mr Lane then interjected urging him to relax as well, he was told: Step away, I swear Im going to punch your f***ing head in.

He then allegedly struck Mr Lane with a closed fist, causing the victim to fall to the ground and strike his head on the deck.

Witnesses have told police of seeing a large amount of blood and then hearing the accused man become hysterical: Someone help him, someone help him.

Magistrate Allan Moore refused the Tasmanian bail, saying he was not satisfied that the community would be safe if he was released to bail.

The case will be re-mentioned on Friday.
 




 Sure they have good facilities but how come it still looks so grey and work-like :( 




 I'm not sure if you mean modern day or older times, but for people who really travelled long distances, look up the older explorers from before the 19th century. 

You can start with this [list of explorers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_explorers) on Wikipedia. 




 Do you live under a bridge? 




 This is good but more relevant for essays and reports I think. 




 Those are pretty good. I like the [single fork](http://www.moolf.com/images/stories/Interesting/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe-9.jpg), [can lid](http://www.moolf.com/images/stories/Interesting/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe-14.jpg) and the [bee](http://www.moolf.com/images/stories/Interesting/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe-33.jpg).  




 Yeah that's the difference. Ours get a decent wage so we don't have to tip. 

I also only recently learned you have to tip in Canada too. I thought they had the same system as Australia. 
 




 Does it vary from place to place or is it the same all over the US?
 




  Try to die in a month when the demand for funeral services is low.  Perhaps the summer or a temperate spring.  Your loved ones may get a good deal that way.

Okay I'll do my best. 




 Some of the first shots at night are a bit too dark to really see anything, or from different angles. The later ones are good. It's interesting to see most things haven't changed that much though. 




 Did it taste like Fanta?  




 Can someone explain to me how tipping works?

I gathered this:

Most places: 15%

Small towns: 10%

NYC: 20%

And then is it 5% either side of that if you liked or didn't like the service?
 




 My uncle went on the Queen Elizabeth II cruise ship and it was all you can eat all the time. He said there were some americans that had the following meals (each with a full buffet style serving):

* Breakfast

* Morning Tea

* Brunch

* Lunch

* Afternoon Tea

* Dinner (Entres included)

* Dessert

* Supper

When they docked they didn't have enough time to unload all the human waste - there were trucks lining up to take away the sewerage, so the ship left with still plenty of gunk on board.

He is not young (75+) and he said they were the fattest people he'd seen in his life. 




 Yeah :( 

It took me ages to notice too cause I always stare out the window. I only noticed once we went into the tunnels and I saw his reflection in the window.  




 I get the train and the bus, and I don't like public transport because:

* It's expensive

* It's slow

* If the buses fills up they don't stop to let passengers on. So you can't rely on it to get you somewhere on time. The next bus might not be for another 20 minutes.

* Has sick people spreading their illnesses

* It's uncomfortable and crowded - sometimes I can't get a seat and have to stand up, and sometimes I get squished by someone, I also do my groceries and have to carry them on my lap because someone decided to sit next to me with all my groceries instead of one of the other free chairs.

* It's dirty - people always leave their rubbish on the train, especially the later ones after peak hour.

* Bad experiences - a guy once jerked off next to me on the train.


I still catch public transport only because

* It's still slightly cheaper than driving

* The train can be faster than driving in peak hour

I sometimes stay near work and just walk to work, but it is 4km over fairly hilly terrain and can be a little tiring after a long work day, and not that safe. 




 The rule only applies to diagraphs ([link](http://alt-usage-english.org/I_before_E.html)). 




 Or nutella and banana! 




 Fair enough, I guess I found it hard to know what to buy. I half expected that multi grain bread would be just savoury type bread with grains in it, but it was heaps sweet. We don't have any bread that is sweet in the supermarket. Maybe if I went with an American they could have shown me what to buy.  




 I just went to a regular supermarket.  




 Don't worry about that! Just go for it! Have a little faith in yourself. The more obstacles you overcome the more confidence you'll gain, and things will hopefully become easier for you the more experience and knowledge you get. 




 I have always had pretty clear skin, but acne never bothered me on anyone else.

My ex had a lot of acne. When he got older it just went away naturally. He got a face peel done and it looked like he'd never had acne in the first place.  




 oink oink 




 I think what's gross is how pretty much all American food has a high concentration of sugar. For example, bread, cheese, breakfast cereals. The cheese from a regular supermarket there actually tastes like McDonalds cheese, and the bread is like lolly bread. Where do Americans go to buy savoury things, or things with no sugar?  




 I love avocados! 




 I think the US has the largest meal sizes for McDonalds. It's bad enough in the small sizes but the big sizes are just sickening (yet somehow still tasty). 

Their small meal size is equivalent to our medium, and their medium is our large. I'm not sure if a US-sized large McDonalds meal even exists here. 




 Does anyone actually finish their plate there? I've been to the US a couple of times now and I never finished a meal. They were like family sized servings. 




 I don't think your host family is representative of the rest of Australia. We eat pumpkin plenty. But we just don't normally make it into a pie. 




 Sorry, I have no idea. I'm not in that area. I'd need the name of the article to find it. Can you remember the author or journal name? Maybe try a search there. If you can find an link online that's even better. 




 Did you have to pee when you woke up? 




 Bleach is the way to go. Just make sure the room is well ventilated.

Also [DON'T mix bleach and ammonia](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/classic/A795611). It produces toxic gases. Ammonia is contained in some household cleaners ([link](http://www.npi.gov.au/database/substance-info/profiles/pubs/ammonia.pdf)).

  




 This is all John West's fault. We don't have to have the best!! All tuna is excellent. 




 Take lunch breaks. For my first job I didn't. You need that - even 15 minutes - to just have a break and calm/de-stress yourself.

 Good Irish Yodel Farts? 




 Go in for the kiss and when she closes her eyes to wait for it, slap on some wax and let it rip! She'll thank you later. 




 Bad timing 




 A table was standing next to two stacked chairs. A gnome wearing a pointy hat was learning how to dance. He took three steps right and knocked the chairs off their neat stack. 




 Also good if you're paying for part of a meal shared with friends. Then you can just round up the amount to the nearest whole note you have. 





























 I was looking for something else and I just found a story about a real life Lassie (except not a collie rough):

 :) I really really want one. I live in a small apartment but hopefully I can move out soon into a house and get one. We also had a cat we got at the same time and they were best friends. My cat used to curl up in the dog's fur and sleep. I have a better photo somewhere - I can't find it at the moment - but I love this one of them playing together: http://i.imgur.com/EG6J8.jpg.
...though my cat doesn't really look too happy about this game hehe. 




 It was 12 years ago now and thinking about him made me shed a tear. He was ours from when I was a toddler and he was a puppy. Collies are such loving and loyal dogs. I went through some difficult years too and somehow he always made me feel so much better and less alone. I always felt like he knew how I was feeling and just wanted to make everything ok. You're lucky to have him. I wish dogs lived longer.  




 My dog looked almost the same. I miss him so much. He was my best friend for so long. He used to let me cry on him and hug him when I was sad. 




 It might be 40 degrees on occasion in January but usually it's not that hot - check out the weather charts. You'll be here 8 months too so will get cooler in Winter to something like what it is now.

I live near Annandale and $200 is cheap. Start looking now (just to get an idea) on www.domain.com.au for rental places. You can use the ipad app to search around UNSW if you want to. It's pretty good. 




 I got the flu and had similar symptoms. My muscles were really achey and my skin hurt to touch. I was really exhausted but couldn't get comfortable or sleep properly, waking up several times in the night. I was a bit restless. I think I also got a cold while I had the flu, and got really phlegmy. I got a really bad cough and it wouldn't go away. After two weeks of this, and occasionally coughing so hard I threw up a few times, I got some antibiotics. They helped a bit but it didn't just disappear. I got sick in around June and feel about 95% of my healthy self. Cough is still slightly lingering though. I think I just need more sleep. 









 When you do find your own place you will probably need a car to go buy stuff for it. There are a couple of carshare companies (e.g. goget) running in Sydney around the city areas, so this is handy. You can use them to pick up furniture from Ikea at Tempe or Rhodes if that is your thing. It's also handy if you want to get out of the city for the weekend. I have a friend who moved here from Sweden and he is using them as he only needs a car occasionally and he said it is quite good. 









 I went there in April this year. I hadn't been since I was a kid. I copied some photos for you here: http://imgur.com/a/vOeL5.

The turquoise lake is just outside the entrance Jenolan caves and is a really short round trip walk (takes about 15 minutes if you walk slow). 

Just a quick couple of notes. You need a whole day down there, and you should do a cave tour. Inside the caves it is cold so take a warm jacket and good walking shoes. The road is one way down the bottom where they allow inbound traffic only for about an hour or so of the day to allow buses to get down there. 

Oh and go early - especially on long weekends - tickets to some of the more popular tours book out early so you will have to wait around for your tour if that happens. I think you can buy them online (not sure?) which is probably the best idea if available. 




 I think it is great that you are having a positive influence on your daughters life. I don't think religion is as bad as many people make it out to be, although often people stop challenging the system of beliefs put forward by their faith, and that is the most worrying. 

I agree with BlackdogLao that teaching philosophy also is a good idea. When I studied it at uni, everyone had their own input, from all different religious and non-religious backgrounds. Nobody was wrong, but nobody was right, because most philosophical issues are not that clear cut. For example, questions like "You are on a beach and there are 2 people drowning. You can only save one. One is a young person about 21 with their whole life ahead of them. One is your grandfather who may only have a few years left to live. Who should you save?". Some systems of belief teach you that you should save the person with more years to live, but of course most people will want to save their grandfather. 

I am glad you have her interests at heart and it seems you are trying to provide her with a good education. When she gets older she can make her own mind up.  




 You know you can get a door wedge for that? 




 I think entitlement is one of the things that can really tear siblings apart when their parents get old. 

I would prefer my parents teach me how to manage the money that I have/make, than just give me things which I did not earn. That said, a helping hand is good on occasions for the right things.  




 When I was really young we stayed at a motel where they put dishwashing liquid into a glass next to the coffee and tea. I thought it was a welcome refreshment and I drank it. I wish I became a human bubble gun, but I just felt really sick. 




 Not worth it for a lifetime of ridicule. 




 That's spectacular. Makes me want to go there.

 Hobbits would have been good. I wish I saw a show about Hobbits. 




 It looks like Sylvania Waters from the heli shot. 




 Being from the Shire I watched this show only to see what it was. I thought it might be good for a laugh but it wasn't entertaining in the slightest - none of the characters intrigued me, and there was no life story which I wanted to follow. I really don't care what happens to them. I wanted to stab myself in the eyes with a ballpoint pen. I could never put myself through another episode.  




 I'm from Australia. I didn't know it was called bell pepper in a lot of other places until today. :) 









 hehehe cute cat :) He/she has getting in the box down pat, just not the getting out part :P  




 I am currently suffering in really cold air conditioning and searched for topics about air con :P 




 It depends what climate you live in. I went to North Queensland with 95% humidity and 35degC heat, and went on a snorkelling tour where I got heatstroke. And since the water was 26degC it wasn't even cooling at all. I had to go hang out in the shopping center because it was the only place I could get cool in the aircon. 

But being back in Sydney I could easily go without air conditioning. And I actually I find it to be too cold most of the time, especially since every part of the office seems to get different amounts of cold. I also find it circulates all the sicknesses throughout the office and that tends to be worse when it's cold air than hot air.

In the end especially in shared spaces, I would rather have neither. I would miss heating a little bit, and I would miss air con a little bit, but only at the mid-winter and mid-summer days of the year. The rest of the time I'm fine, and since everyone has different preferences for hot/cold it's hard to make everyone happy. At least if nature sets the temperature we save on energy costs/waste. 




 I'm in Shanghai. My flight was actually due out tomorrow (Sat 7th Aug) night but it looks like it will most likely be delayed. I have never been through a Cyclone/Typhoon/Hurricane. I'm in a 12 storey apartment building. I know the basics, like fill the bathtubs with water, get drinking water, non-refrigerated types of food, batteries, torch and radio. 

I'm not sure if I should go to the airport or not - I plan to try to clarify closer to the flight time, but I want to ring in the morning because they will probably be flooded with calls tomorrow afternoon.

I'm expecting lots of rain, power outages and closed shops. 

Is there anything else I should do to prepare/be aware of?  




 I would be interested in the answer to this. More the un-homelessing part.

 Depends if you want to go on a weekday or weekend and what time, and I don't know your price range but I just thought of a couple of places I've been off the top of my head you could look up in the cbd:

* Max Brenners near Wynyard station
* GPO cafe (not sure of the name) - There's 2 inside
* La Guillotine behind Town Hall (actually a restaurant)
* Lime Cafe
* Boy Charlton Poolside Cafe (http://www.poolsidecafe.com.au/cafe/home/) - good on a nice day

 I did this a lot after I got a new fridge. I kept misjudging how far out the door came and my toes would get jammed under the door between the door and floor as I opened it. I think if it got the big toe it would've stopped the door from opening, so I'd have to be in the perfect little toe stubbing position for the fridge to cause any damage... and it happened a lot.  




 I don't know much about bullying or what to do about it but this site seems to have some good advice:

 I wish I had a maths teacher like you. I also wish I was a better maths student in High School. I used to play up a bit cause I didn't understand some of the concepts so to entertain myself I did other things in class. I should have just asked for help.

The gap from High School maths to Uni maths was huge for me. It wasn't actually that I couldn't do it, but that I didn't know what I missed in High School that I needed to know to learn what I was learning at uni (if that makes sense). I got my friends to tell me and I was fine. And after getting past that hurdle I actually really enjoyed Integral Calculus at uni. Second year maths was much more fun that first year maths. I now do a lot of applied maths and I love applied maths even more. 




 Yum 




 Wow great explanation. 




 I'd like to understand why you prefer Australia to be a UK colony?  




 Unless he is the Queen and he holds the highest rank. Then it works.  




 The UK National Anthem "God save the Queen" seems somewhat similar to the US Pledge of Allegiance in its intent.

Australia still has "God save the Queen" as it's Royal Anthem (which I actually only just found out cause nobody here uses it really, I think it's just reserved for royal visits which happen once in a blue moon). Though it was replaced as the National Anthem in 1984. I'm not sure I like the one we have at the moment either. I wish Australia didn't have someone else's Queen. We have for the most part nothing to do with the UK. Unfortunately the referendum in 1999 shows a majority (around 60% of Australia) still want the monarchy. Doesn't help that the white Australia Policy was only abolished in 1973 and official Anti-Discrimination laws only came into place in 1975, so many of the older generation have British roots. I think we just have to wait for those who like the monarchy to pass on. 

Some people want to move forward, but a lot of people like to have a firm hold on the past. 




 That's awesome. I have a genuine respect for EeePCs. Especially how good value for money they are. It did everything I expected and more, and the build quality was excellent.

As long as you back up the data then even if you break it after being a bit rough (which I generally am with things), you can get a new one for cheap. Not that it will break that easily though...

I'd recommend checking out the new EeePC's too.  




 Prouds is okay. Better on sale. 




 What did you do to it? 

Do you put it into sleep/hibernate while you move it around? Cause if not that's not too good for most hdds. 

I have an Asus EeePC 1000H. I literally dropped it down the stairs (in sleep mode) and it's still working 2 years after the incident. 

If you're really rough maybe you should consider a Toughbook or at least get a laptop with a ssd. 

 




 It's his brother from another mother! 




 Thanks :) Sucks a few little sections are missing in a few key spots in the video, but I have a better understanding now. 




 Also dowels are a key ingredient for making meth. 




 This is pretty cool, though I wish you could have the option of continuing to display the images after changing the text. 




 He did say really fast train, though the train in his picture is not very aerodynamic. And also it's powered by steam... possibly magic steam. 




 That sucks. Are electricity prices up for you too? I get a quarterly bill and my electricity cost is double what it was for the same quarter last year. I think I've used a bit more electricity but I don't think I've used double.  




 I like pictures with movement and personality! Kinda reminds me of a [galah](http://www.mariannedepierres.com/wp-content/uploads/galah.jpg) but not pink. 




 The first argument brought up at least 5 times in this article point to women only being after money. Sure, there may be some women like that but there are also plenty that are not. 

The second main argument is that women want to crush their husbands hopes and dreams. Seriously? Firstly it's not going to be deliberate in most cases - you wouldn't marry someone with the intention of making them unhappy. Secondly, we all have decisions to make and being in a relationship means considering their wife and kids. Just like for a wife, being in that relationship means considering their husband and kids. If you aren't willing to make those compromises then yes, you shouldn't be in a relationship regardless of whether you are a man or a woman. However there is so much to gain from a loving relationship, so you have to decide what's more important to you.

The third thing I take issue with is that the poster implies that he shouldn't need to pay child support. Maybe sometimes the amounts are unfair, and if that is the case I see the point, but why shouldn't both parents be equally involved in the upbringing of their kids? 

If you really have this hatred for marriage then maybe it is best you don't marry. I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone that resented me. 




 I was wondering how you would remove these things, and thought this was relevant:

http://www.cyber-nook.com/water/Solutions.html

Maybe if you combine a certain types of filters with boiling it would be fine (or maybe you can just use a filter - not too sure). 

As that site says, depends where you live and what type of contaminants are in your water.  




 Maybe if she stands on a chair it would work. 




 I was wondering though, if you were in Johannesburg would you be safe carrying that type of equipment around? Would people still take that risk? I feel like you could just get mugged at any time there. 




 I liked the video. 




 He looks like he just ate a whole business of flies! So full! 




 The CBD is okay but a bit more expensive not only in terms of rent, but groceries, bars/drinks. Of course it is probably more convenient if that is where you are going to be working. 

In Glebe you don't have to get the tram, and personally I wouldn't unless you need to be in the city in a hurry and work along one of the tram stops (because it's expensive and it doesn't go right down into the more central parts of the city like Town Hall/Wynyard). The buses are a bit slow   busy during peak hour though I will admit - especially if you are catching the ones that go up Glebe Point Road. I think if you work in the city from Glebe, walking or biking is probably the best option (  cheapest). You can walk straight through Pyrmont and be in the city in around 30-40 mins (approx 3-4km walking). The bus is fine for most other times (rainy/cold/dark days) and taxis are usually $20 if you have a night out and miss the last bus. 

Some of the other areas suggested are good too though, but it depends on what you're after exactly. 




 Not to say it doesn't happen - but I've never heard of anyone getting typing strain (that I know). Is there anyone here who has?

I find my problem is not that I can't type fast enough but that I can type faster than I can think... stupid brain! 




 I go in the shower and blow my nose into my hands and then wash it off. I find the hot steamy water loosens it up so it comes out freely.  




 Tilt your head to the right and look at it. 




 It can! Apparently!

 Me too! My mum used to be a typist on a typewriter for the railways. Does your mum press the buttons real hard and deliberately? I saw another lady on a public computer in the shops once and she typed like my mum and I think she might have been a typist too!  




 Yeah it's always hard because even if they don't intend to hurt you they sometimes do because, well, they're people. And it's often people you are close to as well that hurt you the most because they're the ones whose words and actions you care about. :( *Hugs* 

The result won't always be the same though. It sounds like it turned out badly this time, but it won't always be that way. You actually sound like a really strong person in that you are clearly trying hard and you have overcome a lot of things to get to the point you're at. It might be good to lower your expectations a little, take things a little slower, and of course give yourself a break if you need it, but don't give up on what you want. You will get there. 




 Your comment reminded me of [this](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=depressions-evolutionary) article.  




 Did something happen today? 

It sounds like you're trying really hard to make your life better - don't give up. It's a difficult thing to do but you can do it. 




 I like the ones that are slapped on haphazardly. Goes with their parking style. 




 Yeah I'd go for lazy as well. He probably should have put in a little bit of effort thinking up a better excuse though. 




 Lol yeah, on the way to the zoo I saw some rednecks and thought we were already there. 




 It was for a conference. It was a pretty strange place to go for my first trip there but I didn't mind it! The zoo there is pretty good for a little place in the middle of nowhere. 




 I met another Australian on a plane once while I was there who did it. He said his experience involved a bunch of kids whose parents have too much money, neglect them and want to send them away for the summer. He was saying he didn't really like it that much. But I'm sure there are people who experience it differently. 




 I'd like to see an American do this on a world map. 




 That's true about that. I used to think I'd like the technology there, cause when I was in primary school I had a friend who went there and she told me all about how everything was automatic. But when I got there none of that really impressed me, but I was incredibly impressed with the Grand Canyon. I was also impressed with Niagara Falls, tho I would have been more impressed if I could feel my extremities. 




 I didn't know it was about the politicians! Actually I didn't even know it was called the windy city until I was coming down for landing in the plane and it was really turbulent. That's when the guy next to me told me about it being the windy city. Felt like it made sense at the time.  




 My first destination in the US was Omaha!  




 Thanks! That is awesome. I didn't know about old versions of magazines on Google Books.

Also look at page 168. Made me laugh.  




 I managed to dig up some information that shows people are trying to do something to help those who have been attacked:
http://www.newser.com/story/35103/pakistani-salon-hires-fire-acid-attack-victims.html
 Pakistani women disfigured by acid and fire attacks have found a second lifeas beauticians, the AP reports. The head of a well-known Pakistani salon chain discovered 5 years ago how commonly women are maimed by crazed or spurned lovers. With the aid of an Italian surgical nonprofit, she has helped many heal and put them to work.

Yet victims outnumber the jobs: 33 Pakistani women were singed by acid attacks and another 45 set on fire last year.


(On a side note, it's good they can work, but wouldn't working in a beauty salon be pretty depressing for them?)
 

And to prevent future attacks in Pakistan:
http://www.ethicsinaction.asia/archive/2010-ethics-in-action/vol.-4-no.-1-february-2010/acid-attacks-a-serious-concern-in-pakistan
 On 26 January 2010, a bill regarding acid violencewhich would specifically target acid related crimes by providing graver punishments for the attackers and by regulating the sale and purchase of acidwill be submitted to the National Assembly of Pakistan. But this only marks the beginning of a long legislative process and it will require some time before the law is successfully adopted and effectively enforced. It will also require a strong political will, which until now, has proven inadequate, if not nonexistent. Indeed, in most of those cases, the judicial institutions have not taken stern sanctions against the perpetrators, which have often been able to walk away in total impunity. Nor has adequate compensation and support been granted to the victims.


And there are new proposed laws in some other countries like Cambodia:
http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2010021632077/National-news/acid-attacks-could-earn-life-in-prison.html
 AUTHORITIES will explore legislating stiff new punishments for perpetrators of acid crimes as part of measures aimed at quelling an apparent jump in reported incidents of the violent attacks, officials said Monday.

The proposal, issued earlier this month after a string of acid attacks, is among options being evaluated by a new government committee charged with decreasing acid attacks by controlling its use.
 
 Ouk Kimlek, secretary of state at the Ministry of Interior and deputy director of the committee, said authorities will discuss parts of a draft 20-point law during a meeting Thursday, including life sentences for those convicted in the most severe attacks.

In drafting the law, the important point that I noted is punishment on people who use acid against someone to make them become handicapped, damage their beauty, or kill, Ouk Kimlek said. They will be sentenced to jail for their whole lives. If the victim is just lightly injured, then there will be a sentence of five or more years in jail.


I guess there is a long way to go still though, and even with current laws there are so many other obstacles to getting someone convicted for their crimes, and even more difficult to stop them from happening in the first place. But I am glad to see people are trying to do something.


 




 There is one outside Broadway shopping center just down from Oportos (on Parramatta Road side towards the city) that I go to that is reasonable (I think like $30 for a womens haircut - not sure how much for a guys but I have seen men there whenever I'm there getting their hair cut too). If you're looking for it you will notice it's got mostly asian women staff. Or you can try Just Cuts in Broadway shopping center - that one is not too bad.

I went to some others in the shops and they were okay (I think $60) but one of them did a head massage, and personally I don't like it because it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. 




 That is quite a walk. I have been taking my lunch and walking to work and I actually feel a sense of achievement by not spending anything unnecessary, but it does sometimes make me a bit tired. 




 So many women must feel like they have no options without being allowed to have an education. And those in the article who had the courage to make their own choices are more than severely punished for doing so. I wonder what sort of life they will live after an acid attack when an education is not allowed. What sort of job they will get to support themselves. I also didn't realise the number of women this was inflicted upon. I had heard of it before but thought it was rare. Very sad. 




 I think I am the same like that. I like 'testing' out ideas, but actually implementing them and going into that sort of detail doesn't really interest me either.

I like art too and I've always found it easy to come up with good ideas, but my technique sucks. In high school I came up with this idea and I went about painting it. One of my friends who is reknowned for copying other people's ideas did it as well. Only she painted it way better than me, and I will be the first to admit that. My idea was there but my skills aren't up to scratch. It might just be a matter of practice and finding time to do it. I went to Tasmania a couple of years ago and went for a bushwalk and noticed heaps of guys in the bush painting. It looked really enjoyable and relaxing, and I thought maybe one day I will do that.  




 What makes you tick, where do you want to be, what makes you happy at work, leisure or at other times?

At work I like to discover new things or create something new and see what I find. I like improving things. 

My home time is much the same. For example, when I had time I liked gardening cause I could be creative and pick what I wanted to do with the space and then make it happen and the results looked nice. I like creating new things too and trying new things, though I don't always finish what I start if I find something better to do.

My leisure time ideally involves being around trees or water or getting involved in nature-based activities like surfing or snowboarding, and I love that it's always different and I find it really relaxing. Oh I guess I like sports generally that involve some kind of challenge, not like jogging straight but a team sport is good. 




 I actually socialise a lot with different groups of people, but if I make too many plans I can feel myself screaming inside wanting to have my own time to be alone doing things that I enjoy. It's not that I don't like people. I just also like my freedom, and when I am around people I have to be considerate of them, and can't just always do whatever I want. 




 I like constructive criticism but encouragement would easily work better on me. That said, I think that's the same for most people. 




 Generally I have poor focus but once I am interested in something I have excellent focus (particularly at the last minute).

I found my lack of focus a problem in lectures at uni until I started trying to think of questions to ask for everything. I'd try to answer them in my head or look them up and if I couldn't find the answer I'd ask the lecturer. It helped keep my mind a bit more engaged. This applies to everything now. I don't have too many problems focusing. 




 I'm an analyst programmer too! But only for the last 2 years. Before that I did research. I preferred the amount of control I had over my work before compared to what I have now. 

I can't accept things for the way they are and go about my daily business, I have to always be improving things and making things better. I like researching about something, learning about new things, and putting my own ideas into things and testing them. I am hoping I've picked the right career but I can't think of anything else I could be doing right now anyway.
 









 I do sometimes, and then I lick it! 




 A) I agree. I don't mind pressing the flush button as long as I don't have to press the tap or door handles when exiting the bathroom. I appreciate a sink with a foot pedal like in Italy, or a sensor. 

C) We don't have many of those self-flushing toilets in Australia, but I didn't like them when I was in the US because I kept trying to do a poo and while I am a novice at self flushing toilets, the sensor kept thinking I wasn't there and flushing while I was pooing, splashing my bum which was gross. I didn't like that :( Is there a way to stop them from flushing against your will? 




 I am a fully grown adult and I want that book now. 




 I guess the intended meaning of the idiom is that 'it's not fair to judge apples and oranges by the same criteria', rather than it being impossible. Therefore I think that the idiom 'you can't compare apples and oranges' to be a bit vague and misleading, because you *can* compare them, on a variety of properties such as price, taste and color for example, even though, as you pointed out, it may not be fair to do so. 

Nevertheless, we do it all the time with everything. We have to in order to differentiate between things and make decisions. 

Ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_and_oranges

On a related note, I think that when you make a statement about your taste in art you can acceptably say 'I prefer this artist over the other artist' but you cannot definitively say that 'This artist is better than the other artist' because you are in a way suggesting that everyone feels the same way. Whether an artwork is 'better' to you really depends on how that artist has satisfied your taste preferences, which may not be the same as someone elses. So to be specific you would have to say 'According to my criteria for preference of art, this artist is better than the other artist'... or something like that anyway... 




 Why can't I compare apples and oranges? 




 Eat healthy food and try to get enough sleep. I was repeatedly sick for ages and didn't know how much difference a good diet and enough rest could make until I did it. Difference is huge.  




 I don't think I could stand just working for the future. I want to enjoy my life along the way. 









 I have been feeling this way too recently. Sometimes I find it really hard, and for a while I make progress but then there's moments where I feel like I just got reeled back to where I started. You just have to have faith that things will get better, even if you can't see that sometimes.

For now, it might not feel so great but just give yourself time, don't worry about how long it's taking, just let up on yourself a bit. This is how I have been trying to cope.

Firstly, stop worrying about the distant future so much. Concentrate on today, and making every day count. Think - what can you do today that will make you feel better? What is a positive step you can make to make the next week/month more bearable? (just to be clear I don't mean drugs or alcohol)

Next, I don't know if this works for everyone but I always give myself some time to grieve, say like 5-15 minutes or sometimes longer, whatever it takes to feel like enough. The, after I have sulked I force myself to move on and do something else. No use sulking for hours. You have to let it out but you also have to realise sometimes you're just going overboard. 

Third, don't look at other people and compare yourself. Everyone leads a different life. A lot of my friends got married quite young and I am still not. I don't see myself as a lesser person, I just chose to spend a lot more time at university and so I'm just not at that stage yet. I don't really care what they do, my life isn't about what they do, it's about me. It's up to you if you want to hang out with them but if it's making you feel worse maybe you can set yourself a time limit for seeing them so you can cope with it better. 

Finally, think about what you want in life. Start with short term goals. Things that will make you feel a bit better today, tomorrow, this week. Then when you feel like you can cope day to day, think about the rest of the month, then the next year. See how you go with that. 

As for the girl, every time you think about her force yourself to think of something else that you like instead. She has obviously moved on and you need to as well. It's not going to help you to think about it all the time.

Everything takes time, but if you spend so much time sulking and feeling crap it will be hard for you to make progress and for things to feel/get better. These things might not make you feel better straight away but keep trying and hopefully every day things will get just a little bit easier.

 




 :( Hug? 
























 Any suggestions?   




 How old is everyone in this thread? You think now is bad? There was a time things were much much worse with our rail system... it's actually pretty good now in comparison.  




 Also I heard someone say once that the employees who are happiest are the ones who know they are learning skills and could get another job... and so they are less likely to leave their current job.  




 What did you do before and what do you do now? I have also been considering a career change. 




 They're making some interesting Big Macs. 




 My bus is always packed and it would be completely unreasonable to expect someone to get off at a particular door. You always go to the one that is closest. 

There are no real rules on buses except I think most people try to be nice to each other. It's bad enough we have to cram into a tube with 50-70 other people. We are all probably not that happy about it.  

Really the worst thing for me is when someone really stinks badly and there is nowhere else for me to move to. It's probably the only thing that will make me get off a bus and wait for the next one.  




 Yeah I've also noticed there are a lot of devs that have done a masters degree here and got a job after that.  




 Try applydirect.com.au too - I no longer apply to recruiters. For me it is a waste of time.  




 Our company is in a niche area and we hire heaps of people from overseas. Actually as an Australian I am in the minority here. If you're not in a niche then I agree it is probably difficult. A lot of people I know from the UK have already been employed by companies like pwc and then it was an internal transfer within their company to Australia. 




 One interview I went to the guy asked for my current pay and then said "oh, I thought it would be less than that" and I was on like $12 an hour. 




 Ah. Maybe my great aunt was just really weird then lol 




 If it helps, my mum's aunt was very traditional British and wanted my mum to return to England to marry her cousin. My great aunt didn't understand why that was wrong either. But at the end of the day my mum made her own decision (not incest obviously!). 

It must be frustrating but I suppose the best you can do is talk to your parents and ask them not to stereotype and  guide your daughter to help her make her own mind up about what she likes or doesn't like. 




 Me and my sister played with mud and foil tins. No we weren't poor. We just liked it. :) I feel as though kids toys are overly complicated these days. Maybe it's good to have a mix. 




 I can understand why grandparents might do that though. They grew up in a very different world. Not saying they should just that they don't see how it's insane. 




 Mine were like that too. I had each side done while awake. The first side went very well. Second side I got dry socket. Has to be among the worst pain I have experienced in my life. I drugged myself up and tried to sleep through it for a few days. 




 Did they have to shoot it? Would it be possible to just cut its horns? 




 I loooove their cakes. My favourite is the blackforest cake. David Jones at Elizabeth St also has a really good one!  




 What is your favorite way to pay tax? 




 If you need to take something with you like lunch and it's stored in the fridge, put your keys on top of it and you won't forget to take it.  




 Set aside some time by yourself with nothing planned. You can just do whatever you feel like doing at the time and live life in the present. Making plans sometimes means doing stuff you don't feel like doing just because you planned it.  




 Stretch when you first wake up in the morning. I don't mean just wave your arms about and yawn, I mean really try to stretch all the major muscles. You will feel a lot better the rest of the day. 




 Before you leave work each day write a list of things you need to do the next day. This lets you leave work at work and stop wasting time when you get to work in the morning. 




 A beautiful scenic shot taken on one of my trips with my loved ones in it. The scenery because I would miss the vast open spaces and it would remind me of a trip that I enjoyed and give me hope for more. And loved ones because it would remind me I have people worth living for and it would remind me that I'm a person who other people care about.  




 I think our service is a bit shitty though generally unless it's a top class restaurant. Even then sometimes it's hit and miss. Although I prefer not having to pay tips I think having to earn it would mean service would be better. 




 You should have the nicest stuff first. It tastes even nicer when you're properly hungry. 




 Hehe I hadn't seen this. This was great. :) 




 My mum told me when I was younger flossing was bad for your gums and I believed her. I just had $4000 worth of dental work with another $6000 needed. Floss dammit!! 




 That is a stupid rule anyway. If I care about someone I will tell them things they might not find nice but need to hear. Timing is important. It's like someone got the timing wrong once, then this rule was made up. 




 It's great you two are motivating each other. My partner and I are doing the same... though we're not ready for obstacle courses yet. And you and your partner look great. The hard work has really paid off :) 




 I feel like this too. We really had the best of both worlds. I was always on the computer but when I wasn't I was out with friends or riding my bike or at the beach. 




 I used to like going to the library and using paper, pens and books. There was a study area when I went to uni in the early 2000s which just consisted of desks with space for your books. They replaced it and now there are just computers everywhere. I used to like that the library was a place to kind of focus without the distractions that you have on a computer or laptop. 




 Tell that to the humans. 




 I'll be honest, and I am ashamed of it now - I was initially not a fan of the cycling lanes in Sydney's CBD. When they were first being built people weren't using them and I felt they didn't really go anywhere. While some of that was true in construction, it was incredibly ignorant and short-sighted. There has been such a great acceptance and uptake of those bike lanes, I wonder how I could have ever had that opinion now. 

I questioned why I felt this way and I decided to give cycling in the city a go (albeit on a weekend because I am scared of being run down by crazy cars). It was great. I don't enjoy riding on the roads but with the cycling lanes it feels a lot safer and I really could enjoy it a lot. I even started riding to work. 

I think people don't like cyclists mostly because they haven't done it, and they are ignorant and selfish. I'll admit that is exactly what I was at the time, and it was wrong. 

I have seen both bad cyclists and bad drivers, but I feel that the attitudes in Sydney at least towards the bike paths and cyclists are slowly changing. I think with more good bike paths that will help as more people start trying them out and taking it up. 

There is one thing I still have a gripe with and that is those lay-down bikes with the little flag (I think they're called Recumbent Bikes). I saw a guy nearly get run over by a truck riding one of those down through the city centre on the non-bike lanes. They're impossible for cars to see, and he's almost asking for whatever fate happens to him.   




 Wash your feet in warm water. I always feel better all over if my feet feel nice and clean. 




 I saw this on the plane and there weren't any subtitles. :(

 Where does milk come from?

He was 19. I thought he was joking and then he explained seriously he thought it was made in a factory. 

We thought we'd better not tell him where eggs come from. 




 There are ways to get cheaper tickets tho. You can get $10 Hoyts tickets through Optus. And I think Telstra does Greater Union tickets for about the same.  




 I was just there! Here's the same spot from my car:

I picked a bad day to drive to work! 




 That makes sense but then I was thinking about 2 core processors or 6 core. They're not square either. I think you're onto something though. It could be about how common circuitry can be shared between cores. 

I was thinking the base is square so the fan can sit on top neatly. And fans have to be round. 




 Could it be related to the temperature? It is one of the less obvious reasons for sleeping issues. [Source]( http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/how-sleep-works/the-sleep-environment). 




 My guess is that it's the way information is stored and processed. 

Binary encoding for data representation is made of bits. A bit is an on/off state which can be used to perform calculations. If you use a larger number of bits for example you can start representing numbers. For example 0101 in binary is 0x2^(3) + 1x2^(2) + 0x2^(1) + 1x2^(0) which gives you the number 5. 

Most of the time processors are built for even number 8, 16, 32, 64 bit length calculations. I think this is because the length of a byte is 8. Why is it 8 bits? It was just what was popular at the time.

Source: [here]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte)

So my guess is that it grew from those origins and they stuck with the even number theme. 




 Two main reasons:
1. High Sugar 
2. High Caffeine and/or Other Stimulants


When you eat sugar, your body tries to regulate itself. It does this by causing the pancreas (an organ in your body that makes digestive enzymes to break down your food) to produce a hormone called insulin which helps your body absorb the sugar and turn it into energy or else store it for later use. When you have a lot of sugar, the pancreas tries to produce more insulin to cope. But doing this often can damage the pancreas and over time it can no longer function properly and can't produce enough insulin. Poor insulin creation or absorbtion is a condition called diabetes. If left untreated, all this extra sugar floating around in your blood causes your blood vessels to harden and this can lead to a bunch of nasty conditions like kidney failure, heart attacks, blindness, nerve damage, etc. 

Source: [here](http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/how-sugar-affects-diabetes?page=2)
and for more information on the 2 types of diabetes see [here](http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/insulin/diabetes-insulin.html)


Sugar is also terrible for your teeth, and its presence causes the acidity in your mouth to increase as you break down the sugar. When the acidity level in your mouth increases, it eats away at the enamel of your teeth, causing tooth decay. 

Source: [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/health/the-mouths-guard.html?_r=0)


Not to mention if you are having a lot of sugar all the time you are likely to be eating more than your daily required intake of Calories/kilojoules and become overweight, which can lead to a number of other health issues. 


Caffeine can actually be good in small doses, as it stimulates your central nervous system and causes your heart rate to increase. It is also a diuretic (makes you need to go to the bathroom). A high heart rate can be useful when you need increased mental alertness but it can be bad if you are trying to sleep. It can also have other side effects such as headaches and vomiting if in really high doses. Large amounts of caffeine can also reduce calcium absorbtion and can increase your chance of developing osteoporosis (thin bones). 

If caffeine is not present they use other stimulants like guarana to have the same effect. 

Also when these stimulants are combined with alcohol they can mask how drunk you are, so you are likely to drink more than you might otherwise.

 Maybe it depends on what you're doing at those times. The hormone Melatonin is released at night causing you to feel sleepy, but it is affected by the amount of light. Maybe if you are in front of a light source, it is disrupting what you body expects to be its daily pattern or circadian rhythm.  




 Here is another one - I tried using lightroom also on the modified photo to add in some vignetting so the edges are darker: http://imgur.com/BdY29kZ 




 It's tough because there is so much noise in the photo I blurred it out a bit to make it less noticeable. I have tried sharpening it again but it just adds the graininess back in and it didn't look so great. See here: http://imgur.com/5c1dO9w

I just tried increasing the contrast - this might be a little bit better - it doesn't look as blurry: http://imgur.com/jrQ0XNQ

Maybe someone else on reddit can help? 




 How do you get rid of the bumps like that? I have a couple of photos of my own that I want to do that for. 




 How's this? http://imgur.com/9OMpZki 




 Are the grey clouds meant to be there or was there a spill on the photo? 




 I think that is the same here in Australia. I love Pepsi Max but I can't drink it because it makes me need to pee really badly. No other cola does that to me. I chose it at first because it was cheaper than Coke but now I'm onto caffeine free Pepsi Light. 




 Yeah it's probably a last resort option though. Turia Pitt was competing in a Marathon and she was trapped by a grass fire so she ran back through the flames. She survived though.

 I found this article kind of interesting -does any of this resonate with you?

 Your minimum wage is $7.25? Is that federal? Ours is a little higher but then our cost of living is pretty high too, especially in Sydney. 
http://www.fairwork.gov.au/pay/national-minimum-wage/Pages/default.aspx 




 I'm not sure if it's directly related, but we often don't have the best service in Australia though. I read somewhere that it's due to changes in formal waitstaff training offerings, but having tips as an incentive must help too. 




 I wanted to save it. I mean that thing has got to be like 1000 years old. But when it started charging at us we had to put it down. :( I am sad but relieved at the same time. 


Edit: I'm sorry for the nightmares! They're actually pretty cool spiders (they kill other pesky insects), and they aren't that poisonous but I just don't like them in my bedroom anymore.

Last time I had one almost as big as this in my bedroom I let him be for 3 days. He didn't move at all so I thought it was fine. But on day 4 I came in the door and he actually charged towards me. I don't think he wanted to be friends anymore... 




 He was sitting right above my bed - actually had to get up on the bed to get him. As soon as we went in the door with the container to trap him he reared up ready for attack. I thought he might run and hide behind the picture, but as we got closer he climbed up onto the tiger picture with both front legs up ready for a fight. By the way, for reference the picture is 32cm (12.5") wide. So he must have been about 8-10cm wide including legs. One of the biggest huntsman I've ever seen.  









 [This guy](http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/askville/4725073_55886428_mywrite/2100734030047620693wapafafs.jpg) 




 I try not to worry about what everyone else is doing. As long as you are doing what you want to do, and if you want these other things, then as long as you are making an effort to go get them, then hopefully things will fall into place when the time is right for you. 




 I had a collie rough growing up and I swear he understood every word when I would talk to him about all my troubles. He would come right up and nudge me and I'd hug him, and I would never feel alone as long as he was there.  




 Cool. I found it in the SAS Survival Guide (little pocket book which is great to carry around): http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/295358.SAS_Survival_Guide 




 According to my survival book, you can obtain it from some plants such as the roots of hickory trees in North America or of the nipa palm in southeastern Asia. Boil the roots until all the water evaporates and black salt crystals are left.

If no direct salt sources are available then you can get it second hand through animal blood. 




 The Cronulla riots happened over 7 years ago now. I wish we could all move on from it.  




 How did you go with this? Is it still leaking? 




 It's bizarre isn't it? I know of plenty of organisations and people that still use faxes and it pretty much always surprises me.  




 We have had a lot of these in my mum's backyard lately. They have been feeding on caterpillars and getting really fat while breeding (I keep finding lots of egg sacs near the spiders I find). I kill them when I see them but they mostly just try to run and hide in crevices. I always feel bad killing spiders because they are sorting out much worse insects in my backyard like flies. Still, they make me feel uncomfortable.

I actually left a huntsman in my bedroom for a few days because I know they're pretty harmless but one day I walked into my room and it reared up and started running towards me. That was the end of our relationship. 




 I just use white vinegar and it works really well, it's cheap and safe for the environment. Also it doesn't scrape off any layers of paint that I am aware of. 




 TIL about lava soap. We have something similar - orange scrub: http://www.septone.com.au/detail.asp?item_cat= item_number=31 page_num=2 
Smells like oranges too. 




 Well, the best water level is water. :) Gotta make sure those hedges are trimmed to perfection! When the water level goes down, it's the first thing people will notice. 




 Good thing they had their headlights on or they wouldn't have been able to see where they were going!! 




 Floodpants or a dinghy... 




 Someone needs to make a book of best-of reddit posts for deperate redditors for when there are internet outages. I'd do it but I'm busy reading reddit at the moment.  




 There's been more information on the Townsville Bulletin website and some updates are [here](http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2013/01/28/374359_news.html). The emergency services numbers have been on ABC 24 all day, but without details of where/why etc.  




 I went to a restaurant (Mad Pizza yum) yesterday and we ordered wood fired pizzas and pasta. The air con in that place wasn't working too well. We sat in there wiping off our sweat with napkins. I kept looking in the kitchen. Really felt bad for that poor guy in there with the pizza oven. But the food was good :) 




 It was in the Shire not Western Sydney and it was a long time ago. Probably in the 90's. Maybe 20 years ago now. 

There are really only two hot years I remember out of probably many - the one when my goldfish died, and the one when a whole lot of my neighbours lost their houses and were sitting in our street with their cars full of whatever they could grab as they had to abandon their homes.

Anyway - Sucks to be in Western Sydney right now!!  




 I was only a little kid and it was almost an extra room of the house with walls on 3 sides, and normally when it's not that hot the fish is fine... just not on that day. I realised about half way through the day and went to get him to bring him inside but it was too late :(  




 I wonder if jogging on a day like today would even begin to give you an idea of how hot a firefighter gets when they're fighting a bushfire. 

I mean there are firefighters out there right now - so I suppose it must feel a thousand times hotter in their suits, with the heat from an actual fire on top of the heat that is hotter than the city. Not to mention more life threatening. They deserve a lot of respect. 

* Edit - wanted to include a pic of firefighters fighting fires in Western Sydney (Penrith) today:

 No but it stopped! But soon there will be thunder and lightning and more rain... If you trust bom. 




 The hottest day I remember in Sydney before this was 44C. There might have been hotter days before or after that but I remember because it was the day I forgot about my goldfish outside on the patio and the water boiled. Rip fishy. :-(  




 I had so many people tell me that and now ten years on, I can tell you that at least for me high school was the worst years of my life and I am so damn grateful those years are over. If you're in highschool don't believe it. It might be true for some people, but it's not a blanket rule. My life is so much better now. 









 Thanks. I've done a little bit more. I don't know how much more time I would be willing to spend on it as there is a lot of work involved but perhaps someone else would like to give it a go. Here's the results of what I've done:

I can't really fix the boy's face as it would require redrawing it as there is so much missing, so I've left the tear over it. Maybe with another picture someone can help you out.

I'm also kind of new at this so I don't really know how to get rid of the green without losing too much photo quality. I did my best.

Good luck! 




 I did a bit of work on their faces but I need to go to sleep now: http://imgur.com/CIfkd
I'll see what I can do tomorrow.

Btw, the boy second from the left is going to be a little bit difficult to reconstruct because of how much of his face is missing. Do you have any other photos of him? 




 Do you have a higher resolution scan? That would be really helpful. There is quite a lot of damage to the photo. 




 haha this one made me laugh. :) 




 No problem :) Glad I could help!  




 http://i.imgur.com/gSxGv.jpg - I think this came out pretty well.

For those who are doing something on it still, this was my first attempt: http://i.imgur.com/xkY9N.jpg
I tried to reduce the white flare on the left a bit so the photo is more even. 
Then it wasn't quite even on the right, so I've used j00jy's version and created a multiply layer to even out the flare on both sides and got the above.

By the way, I'm really sorry to hear about your cousin :(  









 Yeah I like the Australian Reptile Park better cause it's less crowded and some of the animals like kangaroos and emus roam freely, and they have nicer enclosures than both the zoo and the city one, but the downside is that it's also far if you're a tourist. I really like the Galapagos tortoise, the croc enclosure and the Tassie devils there. I guess koala park or featherdale could be another option, but not sure as I haven't been there since I was a little kid. Taronga zoo is ok for Australian animals too. The koala enclosure is good as you can walk up and view them from a high platform, and they have a few small crocs. I don't remember anything about being able to hold them though. Apparently [govt regulations don't allow it anymore](http://taronga.org.au/animalencounter) . They do have a walk around section now you mention it which was pretty good. 
 




 I agree with everything you said! My ring is not 3 months salary but is so amazing. He designed it and picked the stones himself at a family jeweller. To me it is perfect. I have the most beautiful engagement ring. I've since seen ones with bigger price tags and would never trade. You know what really makes it extra beautiful is not the ring itself but what it represents and more importantly who it comes with :) That's what I think of whenever I see it... not the price tag.  




 - Taronga Zoo
- Sydney Harbour/The Rocks
- You should probably go to at least one beach (Bondi is the most touristy, Manly is where all the expats live, Coogee is another city beach option). Manly has an arts   crafts market on Sunday (http://www.ourmanly.com.au/Travel/manly-markets.aspx).
- Sydney is known for markets, depending on how much you like markets there are just so many... [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_markets_in_Sydney) is not a bad list but the best for tourists (near the city) are probably Paddy's Markets near Central Station, The Rocks market, Manly Arts   Crafts and Paddington Markets. Don't get all market-ed out though. They are not all places to get a bargain - some, like the Rocks and Paddington Markets can be expensive.
- Harbour Bridge climb is an option (costs $$ but I hear it's good), or if you prefer you can just walk across it for free.
- Visit some kind of national park and go walking - There are some good ones around the city, but if you want the real bush then you need to go to a bigger one and you need a car to get there - for example The Royal National Park or Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. If you're really keen then you could also go to the Blue Mountains. There's some WW2 gunner stations at Mosman which are interesting to walk around, and have a great view. Again though, not easy to get to without a car.
- Go to some sort of wildlife park - especially if you're not from Australia. One that is easy to get to is the Reptile Park in the city next to Sydney Aquarium. They have crocs and other Australian animals there.
- While you're there you may as well go to the acquarium. It's not bad, they have penguins and stuff.
- You could do a harbour lunch cruise - try get a deal (like on ouffer or something) and it should cost you about $50 for lunch on a cruise boat. 

For gigs:

There's probably more things I could suggest, but that's all I have off the top off my head right now. 




 I agree with the others about the salary being decent.

Off topic slightly, but related to income... Check out this page about LAFHA (Living Away From Home Allowance) - it could be useful:
http://www.lafha.com.au/Employees.aspx

There's been some changes in this year's budget in relation to it, due to people abusing the system, but I think (depending on the sort of visa you get) you can still get it. I know most people at my company have LAFHA payments, as we have a lot of staff coming from overseas due to our skills shortage. Check out the bottom of that page for more details. There's probably some more stuff on expat forums as well you could search for. 




 My cat had pretty long fur and had really bad fleas once and was running around biting random objects and jumping around like she was on fire. I had to give her a bath to get rid of some fleas and then we put her on flea medicine after that. Probably should have done that in the first place.   




 Why does the girl look so disgusted at the kitten?
