 I didn't even know what one of those was until right now and mine is raging! 




 Yeah I think it was captioned something like that but I thought it just seemed a bit random in comparison to the rest of the documentary. Wasn't sure if it was actually a younger family member or something.

Still, wish I was taken under Jack White's wing when I was that age!  




 That bit was awesome! But who was the strange orphan boy that followed him everywhere?? 




 Really?? I always assumed it started using the necks of beer bottles but that's way more disgusting and cool!

And I found the album on spotify so I'll check it out, cheers for the recommendation 




 Check this out, it's what made me have to buy one

 I've got a tuner so I'm just messing around with a few and seeing how they sound. Got it tuned open D at the moment but my capo is fast becoming my best friend for switching to open E 




 Man I used to love those songs a few years back, good choices! 




 Just started off with A Boy's Best Friend, nice and simple but really satisfying to play! Thanks! 




 After watching "it might get loud" last night and watching Jimmy Page, Edge and Jack White do an awesome bit of slide improv I headed straight out today to get a slide.

Anybody got any good song recommendations for me to learn? And perhaps more importantly are there any drills I should practice with it? 




 Well that was easy! 




 RIP this subreddit  




 10 hours a day?! That's insane! I might break this into 1 hour a day for a month or something  




 While I admire what he achieve with his body, this guy is a massive douche and represents everything wrong with male culture today.

Downvotes ahoy!  




 Where did you get the reddit pick? Awesome! 




 Not saying you're wrong, but why?  




 This is awesome to jam to, love it! 
























 I did half-GOMAD about a year or so ago and it definitely did work. The biggest problem is trying to adapt to a normal diet afterwards - milk doesn't really stretch your stomach that much and I found that I actually lost weight when I tried to switch back to solid foods as I couldn't eat as many solid calories. 




 Fun fact, I work in insurance and when you allow your email to be shared with third partys that includes us. We then use this info to help track you down if you flee an accident. 




 I used to work at Game in the UK. I remember other sales people thinking I was mad for not forcing a pre-order on this nervous little 9 year old kid who clearly didn't want it. I guess I just don't have the killer instinct needed for sales. 




 Shot from the new paranormal activity movie? 




 Pssssht I account share anyway, I'll give him my login and we'll use the netflix money to make a statue or something  




 I forgot I'd subscribed to this sub and thought /r/showerthoughts had gotten really deep!

But you make a fascinating point and I think I agree with you, whether or not I'm happy about it is another thing entirely. 




 Label your knuckles as in the picture

All raised knuckles have 31 days, all grooves between knuckles have 30 (except for that dastardly February which has 28) 




 Doing a poop. 




 I suppose it's just famously used in both a wartime perspective and a peace perspective. Maybe they do mean the same thing, or maybe they're not linked at all, either way nobody I spoke to in person knew so I thought I'd ask historians. 




 It just occurred to me that the "v" gesture changed from a war-related symbol to the complete opposite! Any insight would be much appreciated. 




 Although I'm just a beginner I did read a paragraph on this in a gourmet shaving book today, the author said if a brush is still doing this after 1-2 weeks you should contact the seller. 




 I definitely will, I couldn't believe how generous it was! I want to shave 10 times tonight so I can try it all out! 




 He wrote a note that said "exceptionally cold" as well haha! Your warning has been heeded! 




 I just got given a sample of this but I'm totally new to shaving properly, should I be excited?? 









 Goodbye xbox live membership! 
























 Hi there,

Sounds like you're definitely experiencing some anxiety in your situation, perhaps a bit of depression aswell. I'm not a professional though so don't take my word on that.

It sounds like you're going through a really difficult situation right now and I'm not surprised that you're having these feelings - in fact it's probably quite a normal response. The problem seems to be that these feelings of anxiety aren't serving their purpose of motivating you, and have got so severe that they're having a negative impact on your life.

I imagine you haven't had any previous input from professionals as you mention that you've not felt like this before, but there are plenty of techniques you can use to help combat these feelings ranging from the professional route to the self-help route.

Perhaps the first thing you should consider is meditation, you'll be amazed at how quickly this can make you feel physically calmer (within minutes!) and there are loads of online guides that will help you get started. It's very difficult at first but it will at least be a first step of making you aware of how busy your mind is and hopefully help you identify the negative thoughts that are making you feel this way.

I hope this is a helpful starting point and please message me if I can help in any way! 




 I find they're really helpful. All of the unpleasant feelings that you have at the moment are based on what is going to happen in the future. If you practice meditation or mindfulness you can start to focus yourself to be in the moment, and speaking from experience this is a huge release. It helps you release that at any moment you can get away for these horrible feelings if you need to.

Do you have a smart phone? There's an app I could recommend, if not I can have a quick look for some online sources 




 Okay well that's a good start. TV is great at taking you out of the moment and helping you focus on other things. Have you considered trying meditation or mindfulness at all? 




 Being a person is the hardest thing you'll ever do, I've been in some pretty dark places, but it's also the best thing.

First things first, have you tried any coping mechanisms already? 




 I know that feeling, it's nice to stay in a comfortable, safe place after experiencing anxiety for a while. I think that doing this will only serve to increase your anxiety in the long run though. 

You've got to keep pushing yourself to leave that comfort zone and you'll get back to normal soon enough. Try and force yourself to go to the gym today, PM me when you've done it to keep yourself accountable :)

You're not alone with these feelings and they're definitely possible to overcome! 




 I don't know about dangerous mental illnesses, but I know that a lot of Psychology students suffer from mental health problems. Who's best motivated to raise awareness and treat people with mental illness? The one's who suffer from it.

 To anyone about to watch this, don't be put off by the title and watch it all the way through. 




 I have a horrible feeling this is a cropped scene from The Walking Dead. 




 Brothers, sisters, thank you for showing me the whey 

Although I am but a few steps down the iron path, it has been well trodden by those who have worshipped before me. I have seen that whilst the path is treacherous, all those that walk it with devotion in their hearts are rewarded.

Today I gazed into the mirror and with great joy saw my first blessing - I beheld not a boy, but a man!

Now all that remains is to visit my temple and give thanks. 

Let them lift weight - Brodin willed it, and it was done. 




 Alas, you have paid the price for being tempted by Broki. But fear not, although the path may now be somewhat longer, it is laid out before you still.

One step at a time brother. Make us proud. 




 Couldn't agree more, everybody is more worried about how they look themselves! 




 Hmm, kinda funny looking. 




 I'd probably grab a fistful of poop from the toilet and fling it at them, if that doesn't work I don't know what will! 
























 When I washed dishes for a living the head chef suggested the "pissing cow" technique. Stand with your legs as far apart as possible and you'll be a lot lower.

 Give the Celexa another week or so, these types of drug need to build up in your system for a while before they take effect. 

Have you explored any non-medical treatments yet? There's so much out there for you to try and everyone has something that will work for them. Don't give up hope, we're all here with you! 




 That document is brilliant, thanks for sharing! 

I actually went for the grab-bag idea in the end. I got the previous speaker to choose the next speaker's item, so that there was always a bit of time for everyone to think about the question. All-in-all I think it went down really well and I got lots of positive comments afterwards! 




 Looks like a used dog toy! 




 Similar problem with my wifi in the past, the password was "cuntbubbles".

I have no idea how it came into existence, I blame my flatmates. 




 This was fascinating, thanks for sharing! 




 Thank you so much, this is really useful! 




 Hi everyone,

Tonight I am going to be Table Topics master for my local toastmasters meeting. I have come up with a seasonal theme for this and am feeling well prepared on that front, however I am unsure how to introduce table topics to the group, particularly if there are any new members.

Does anybody have any advice or key topics I should address when introducing this portion of the meeting? Any help would be greatly appreciated as I am still awaiting my Leadership manual - it is being shipped to the UK so is taking a long time to arrive.

Thanks in advance! 




 Glad to see this at the top, the very fact that the quote starts with the word "but" is a red flag.  




 Thank God you're here, to the top with you!  




 I always jerk off when I'm tired, helps me sleep. 




 I don't think anyone in the thread has said it was intentional, at least I don't think anyone was being serious.

I hope... 




 At my local club we do the CRC method - commendation, recommendation, commendation. Gives the speaker an area to improve in but sandwiches it between praise so they're motivated to do it again. 




 Last night our topics master had some pretty good ones that she actually used with her Primary School class at the start of year for ice-breaking. 

The questions we had were "If you could have any super power, what would it be?", "If you could speak another language, which would you choose and why?", "If you won the lottery, what would you spend it on?" and "Who (living or dead) would be at your dream dinner party?".

They were really fun topics to discuss and quite suitable for beginners too as they're all quite light-hearted. 




 Hey Alison_Hendrix,

I'm in a very similar position at the moment, just started a Masters degree and it scared the shit out of my when I first got here. I also used to be an overachiever and have found it a bit of a shock how much harder I have to work here!

Turning 22 is a scary age, I couldn't agree more. Everyone says your life will start to fall into place at this age but I can vouch for it not being that simple. You do have to work hard for what you want to achieve, but you CAN do it.

Take a step back from your situation at this very moment and try to stay calm. You're probably using these past couple of months to define who you are at this point in your life, and convincing yourself that you're a person who panics and can't get things done. Try to think of your life in the context of who you were before that as well. You've achieved so much already and with just a little bit of hard work you can achieve everything that you want.

Don't get too hung up on the past, focus on what you need to do in this very moment to succeed. 

Oh, and try meditation!
