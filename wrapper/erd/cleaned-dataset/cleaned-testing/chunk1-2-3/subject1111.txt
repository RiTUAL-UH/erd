 I can't really see the Greeks wanting to be that rude about the Canadians though..... 




 I bought some wood by the metric foot last week. Gloriously archaic :-) 




 Yup, this is kinda why I've never understood the hang up that people have over the licence fee. If you assume its a mandated tax (it isn't, but hey...) then it's some of the best value you'll ever see for that money.

Personally, I see no reason to pay for satellite or cable - I'm not a big TV watcher anyway and find that nearly everything I enjoy watching comes from the BBC anyway, so I don't see the point in paying for a much wider range of stuff I don't want to see anyway.

Check out Luther or The Escape Artist, both of which are excellent drama series. We're also enjoying The Paradise, which is a more traditional costume drama on its second series now.

There's also a convincing argument that Sherlock is worth the licence fee all on its own... :-) 




 Yup, regions that don't pay the licence fee watch ads to help fund more telly. I have no problem with this. Same with the BBC's web content, I believe.

But on home turf, its strictly non-commercial and this is how it should be. I hate ads and 150pa is a small price to pay to be shut of them.

Interestingly, most Sky subscribers pay 2-3x as much and still get ads on every channel's. This seems a much stranger situation to me... 




 Operation Ouch on CBBC is worth the license fee on its own...well so the kids tell me anyway ;-) 




 Not in Blighty it doesn't. Check your facts please. 




 I enjoy quality programming from the BBC and don't like to watch adverts. 

I'm sure you can make a sustainable TV network without a license fee (note: it's not a tax) but it means watching 20 mins of ads per hour of TV. Oh, and still paying more than the license fee cost to a cable provider for the privilege to watch them.

Thanks, I'll stick with the Beeb. 




 What a bucket of bilge. 




 It would be easier to change the moon's orbit than to move the wife from Waitrose, I'm afraid.

Good queuers there too, BTW ;-) 




 Thank you. It's a strange thing, but if you asked them, I'm sure most customers would also be proud of it.


We Brits can be a strange bunch, but you can always spot us shaking our head at "5 queues for 5 tills" when travelling abroad. It just doesn't happen here...we'd automatically and without a single word being said, create a single master queue feeding all 5 tills in a fair and equal way.

Love it :-) 




 Fair point, but typically the frier cooks the food and neither serves it nor takes payment. He does however accept the initial verbal order ("two large haddock and a battered sausage please, mate") so he can be getting them in to cook while you're properly ordering and paying.

Most decent chippies have an order taker, a wrapper and a frier. 




 My local chip shop (Leeds, UK) has a very strict queuing system:

1. Enter shop. Place order with frier who starts cooking it immediately.
2. Walk straight to till, place order and pay
3. Walk to back of queue.
4. Wait.
5. You are served strictly in order and the best part is that while you're queuing you're food is being cooked, so you're not really being held up
6. Collect food and enjoy it.

Efficient, brutally fair, and all freshly cooked. I've been to many, many chip shops and found few that work like this. I've also found none that serve better food and cope with a lot of customers so efficiently. Shops that don't work like this actually make me stressed!

Queuing is culturally embedded in Britain and I'd have it no other way. 




 Give me back my fortress, you bastards! 




 I loved ad d (note username ;-) but my heart still lies with Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (way before the battle stuff) and, even earlier, the wonderful Dragon Warriors series. I enjoy fantasy because of these two wonderful series.

Not sure how much light they saw outside of blighty though.

Love em still :-) 




 As a parent of two (5 and 7), I still read to them every night. For the eldest, we mix it up between me reading to her, her reading to me and her reading by herself, but neither of us is quite ready for me to stop reading to her - after all, it's fun :)

Stephen Fry reads Harry Potter to us all when travelling in the car. Does this count? 




 Yup, and that's also why they don't take off planes noise to tail. If they did, following aircraft would hit turbulence caused by the previous take off... which may be very serious indeed.

Check "wake vortex" for more info. 




 Indeed. Although when you realise that you've left your phone, the first thing you do is....reach for your phone!

In my case, I'd been dropped at a hotel so ran inside and borrowed the concierge's phone to quickly call mine. It just rang out and I started to panic then looked out of the window to see the cabbie waving at me from the drop off area.

Shock news! Most people aren't arseholes! (Well, ones in the real world anyway ;-) 




 I left my phone in a London taxi. After realising I'd done so, I called the number and the friendly taxi driver drove back and returned it, earning himself a nice tip.

The end :) 




 Wireshark. Unquestionably the most useful tool in any IT admins tool bag.

Not free, but I'd rather use a Mac than be without ALTAP Salamander. Any two pane file explorer would be better than nothing though :-) A few people mentioned windirstat, but the functionality is baked right into AS so I never miss it :-) 




 Fair comment on 3 hour play, but on a 30 minute sitcom...? 

The ideal format for a 30min TV programme is no bloody adverts at all! 




 It's really sad, but kinda inevitable, that the first and most earnestly discussed point of this thread is the cost of treatment. Coming from the UK, it seems /so/ strange that this should be so.

This is a really odd question, but what would have happened if you weren't insured? Would the medical system really have refused your son treatment because of something as silly as ability to fund?

Anyway, don't want to detract from your original post. Sincere wishes for a speedy recovery. 




 :-) 




 Rubbish!

A carefully, well reasoned argument there ;-) 




 Dunno, 30k miles a year, means you'll probably have done 1/2 a million by then.

The point is that cars kill kids. It's a shame, but it's the truth. Just at the point kids are at their most headstorng and at their least likely to listen to adults, we give them a 2 tonne killing machine and say "there you go, knock your socks off".

Kids think they are great drivers. They are not. They are rubbish. And they need this hammering into them. Realising that you are a rubbish driver is probably the one thing that will keep you alive long enough to stop being rubbish. 




 He's in high school. When he's got a dozen years and a few hundred thousand miles under his belt, I might revise my estimate. 




 Sorry, my friend, but he did noone a favour that day.

1. You were a rubbish driver
2. You were well over the speed limit
3. He effectively told you to "carry on, sonny"

This time you were lucky. Next time your inexperience might kill someone. 

Cop FAIL. 




 Check the in car footage from Nando's and Hamilton's cars - it was a pretty dangerous move from both drivers and a reprimand was a fair penalty.

Tough luck on Webber that 3 in a year means an automatic penalty, but them's the rules and it's hard to argue with them (even though, personally, I thought it about the best part of the race :-/ ) 




 you're a cunt if you only tip 10 percent

Or not from the US... Tipping 30 or 50% of the meal cost? Mental! 




 Couple of things to note:

1. I always start out writing a select statement that returns the rows that I want to modify, and then changing it to an update. Paranoia always wins :)
2. MySQL has a not well known startup flag that disables unqualified delete or update statements (i.e. where you've forgotten the "where" clause). Amusingly, it's "--i-am-a-dummy" :)

Otherwise, this made me spit my tea on my keyboard. Certainly, an IT guy's idea of horror - give me hairy monsters and vampires any day!

Anything else and you're not thinking straight ;-) 




 My wife has had ITP for the last 3 1/2 years after she started bruising for no reason. Her platelet count dropped down to  10k when she was first admitted and bounced around for a couple of years, following her various treatments.

We've managed to avoid any serious interventions (it's /always/ possible to drag your feet instead of going under the knife!) so it's really been an inconvenience rather than a serious illness. As her doctor said to her: "You're ill, not dying."

For the last 12 months she's stayed above 30k unaided and has managed to avoid any trips to hospital for IVIG and, even better, she's just started mountain biking again (with a helmet!)

Best of luck to you and, from my experience as a partner of a sufferer, please remember not to let it own your life - even if it never goes away, you can live a more or less normal llife. Oh, and don't be too quick to have bits chopped out ;-)

Hope the financial aspect is OK for you. We're UK based, so at least we don't get a bill at the end of each month!

 It would be a cold day in hell before I used SSDs in RAID0! They are just way to likely to dump your data....and the best part is that you've just made it 4x as likely to happen....  




 Fair, but any company that's charging that much for such a small amount of labour would get grumpy customers. I know I would be pretty unhappy as I would be certain that I'd been ripped off on the installation charges! 




 On the day this was released, my then girlfriend and I noticed that the cover image was a painting held at a museum in Manchester (UK, to avoid confusion). We immediately skipped lectures and went to find it.

In short, it was in storage but the nice lady at the museum desk was slightly surprised that a few people had come in that day asking about the same obscure painting.

Still think fondly of this with my uni years. It's always been a favourite of mine and I still think it's Weezer's best album... 




 Interesting story, but $300k/yr for installing kitchens...? Are you quite sure they were making a profit?

My domestic kitchen cost me about $2k to have installed (in the Uk) and took a few days (big kitchen!)... Certainly someone asking that kinda money isn't going to be doing many domestic jobs here! 




 I challenge anyone placed in a situation where green means success to /not/ utter the immortal:

 I use Tasker to only allow specific apps to rotate the screen. Sorted for me.

Also, never rotate when powered - I read on my side in bed so this sorts that too as the phone is usually powered. 




 Kinda agree, but notice how supermarkets sell a 4-Pinter, but these are /always/ 2 litres from more expensive shops (convenience stores, filling stations etc) because 2 litres  4 pints so they can charge higher prices for less product.

If 4-pinters were banned tomorrow, no one would notice that we were paying the same for less.

 




 Most, but not all:

Conti tyres (Germany)

Plenty of other options out there that you can use on your own doorstep, even in poor, third-world America where you don't have HopeTech on your doorstep ;-)

Buy local! Support these businesses! 




 Too much good to mention it all: the drunk odd couple, napkins, the world's greatest speech, plenty of real emotion and some awesome acting.

It takes a brave man to make the whodunit part of a Sherlock story incidental to the episode, but it worked very well. Top notch writing and a first class screenplay.

The best thing about Sherlock is that you never know what you're going to get each week. If I wanted predictability, I'd watch Murder She Wrote ;-)

 




 Depends on school - ours in uk has cheapest possible uniform that costs peanuts from the supermarket. Even the kit with the school logo on comes from Tesco and is super cheap!

School uniform FTW as both parent and child. 




 Not sure if serious, but my gym is silent (well, no music anyway) and most people wear 'phones so they can choose their own pain :-)

I have some custom moulds for my Etymotics that block out everyone else and allows me to curse and complain in complete isolation. Recommended. 




 Great idea. Thank heavens the UK only has one major city that we can stuff all of this great investment into, otherwise it might look like we're only capable of making major capital investment south of Milton Keynes...

Pah. 




 Ah, yes. That's very true. I'm making the assumption that in the US, "shoulders" work like they do on UK motorways - that is, they are reserved for emergency vehicles and / or breakdowns. They should not be routinely driven in.

Interestingly, on more and more busy sections of the UK motorway network, the hard shoulder (as it's called in the UK) is being opened up to flowing traffic by use of special signs above that clearly indicate when you can and can't drive in these lanes. In addition, refuges have been built so if you break down, you can park in one of these. Obviously, if you can't make it to one of these, you must stop on the regular hard shoulder, which is closely monitored by automated camera and will automatically switch traffic away from this lane to avoid the blockage.

Not ideal, but we have too many cars and not enough lanes :/ 




 Lot of swearing, anger and gun references, so not sure if you're rational. Still...

Yes, merge-in-turn does work. By having everyone evenly merge in whilst making use of all available road, the traffic backlog is kept in a smaller section of road, this avoiding it from backlogging to the next big intersection and causing a cascaded traffic jam.

Obviously it only takes a few muppets that think they know better to block the merging traffic and the queue becomes worse...and said drivers will always blame this on the merging traffic because they are always right, and therefore the others are wrong.

Grow up, chill out and expand your knowledge and experience on the road. There's no such thing as a fully educated driver :-) 




 Looks like you've burnt a fair few of those fake internet points, so not sure if "swimming against the tide" hasn't just turned into "being downright wrong" 




 Called "zip merging" and it helps to keep traffic flowing by avoiding stalls and minimising queues backing up into other parts of the network. Good practice :-)

Shame most truck drivers here (UK) equate this with pushing in front of their disabled grandma in the queue at the theatre :-/
 




 OK, hard shoulder is fair. But I've seen trucks do this when two (legitimate) lanes merge into one and they've decided that 1 mile from the merge, everyone should be in the inside lane so they block the outside lane.

They should read the bit in the book about zip merging...and then go fuck themselves too :-)  




 No, that was Piz Gloria on the Schilthorn in Switzerland. 




 Fair comment...except that by not liking iTunes (and I really, really can't stand it) this excludes me from both the iPods and iPhones, which both insist on using iTunes and only iTunes for updates and media activities.

So I have Android and I use other media sources (Amazon and Google) for music. Oh, and as I've not bought into the rest, I never bothered buying a Mac either.

Sorry Apple, my Android plugs into anything and is trivially easy to get stuff on and off it without the need for crapware. Your insistence on a closed ecosystem keeps me 100% outside it and thus it will remain. 

And this all begins and ends with fucking iTunes... 




 Your comments are fair but I suspect that you may have a biased view of things (sadly, like me, simply posting on this story gives this away :-)

My wife, brother and both parents were bored silly and while I enjoyed it (it /is/ doctor who after all!) I could see its flaws. 

The episode did jump around a lot and where others have said was because it was too short, I think was because they tried to do too much in a short time resulting in a flawed presentation (too rushed *and* too confusing depending on your level of series immersion)

All I'll say is that my wife has says that she has no interest in the next series and I've got a right bloody task ahead of me to persuade her otherwise. At least I've got a few months!

Perhaps regenerations should be either left out of the Xmas specials or (perhaps better still) done right at the start so that the new actor gets a good run at it. 

Ho hum, I like burning imaginary internet points :-) 




 Awesome. So, we've established that while he didn't invent The Internet (this was obviously done by The Elders, as everyone knows) we are in agreement that he was heavily influential in creating the mechanism that most people use to access it.

Now that we've cleared that up, what piece of mainstream technology have /you/ contributed to society...? 




 Sorry guys, but while it may have appealed to Who geekdom, it bombed in our house. Frankly, it was dragged out way too long and once it was apparent that Smith was on his way, I'd have preferred to see it dealt with and get a bit more time in with the new 'un.

Too much geek, not enough story. Is it too late to get Kylie back?

Looking forward to Capaldi though... Guess it's a few months to wait :-/ 




 Err, didn't Rowling's solicitor's wife drop the ball at a dinner party to show off? Not quite sure this should be bundled with mass surveillance...!

 I'd heard tell that when the injection moulds wear out, they are buried in the concrete foundations of their buildings to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.....

 Yup, it probably was. Sorry :-/ 




 Useful link but as mentioned elsewhere, hardly comparable. I can make a computer out of wood but I'm not really doing that...I'm just shoving modern bits in a wooden case.

Amazing that anyone can actually make such a thing. In fact, I'm amazed by my own (traditional) automatic watch that holds to about 3s per day using nothing more than springs and cogs and shit!

Worth noting that while quartz watches are usually "better" than mechanical ones, they are rarely as collectable nor as interesting. If I wanted a quartz watch, I'd just use my atomically-synced phone :-)

 France loves chips (fries, if you're a Merkin). In Belgium they are more or less the national dish.

Yes, European food tends to be more realistically sized, but chips for every meal does nothing for the waistline!

 Actually, much of Clue isn't actually made up on the spot and this line clearly wasn't, but it's very fair to say that those who think quickest do best and that the funniest bits are the off-script parts.

Look up "Lyttleton's Britain", a collection of Humph's introductions by the man who actually wrote many of them, Iain Pattinson. Hilarious read. 




 Look up "The Letter" from Fry and Laurie. Still one of my favourite pieces of writing.

 I think Merkin camping is different from Yourope camping.

These things are quite common over here and, strangely, more robust than they appear. I used to have one and it was great fun. 

Now I have a touring caravan (large by UK standards, about the size of a beer cooler by American standards...) and it has a nice canvas awning that is a pleasure to erect and rock solid when done right.

2. This is a French language Windows installation. Note that it doesn't say "Start" on the start button ;-)

Staffa is a magical place but Mull and Iona (another small island) are two of my favourite places in the world and are certainly amongst the most beautiful places you can visit.

Mull was recently voted into the top 10 best islands in Europe and considering the competition, this should give and indication of how well people regard it.

 Nah, they're on their way to becoming little adults. They know when they can challenge us and sometimes, frankly, they're right to do so. I want my kids to be independent and, these days at least, I rarely need to impose my will - they know what's right and wrong.

Exercising this judgement is one of the cool things about parenting.

That said, when needed, my authority is absolute. Rarrr! 




 Tough one, but:

"Bring them up to understand that: a) wrongdoing (even accidental) deserves an apology and b) Your parents' word is law"

I.e. refusing to apologise simply wouldn't happen.

My kids are awesome and generally wouldn't even need prompting in this regard. As a result, they get to do a lot more things with us as there's pretty much nowhere that we wouldn't take them. I love being a parent (most of the time, anyway!) 




 Rock Music Rule #1:
If your guitar solo isn't immediately preceded by "GEEETAR!" then it's not a real guitar solo. 




 True, but if you buy an expensive electrical item that fails in, say, 18 months, wouldn't you have a sensible expectation that the product didn't last a reasonable amount of time?

UK returns law is largely rooted in this concept. If you buy something that costs 10 you have a much lower expectation of longevity than if you bought something for 1000. So if that 1k washing machine fails after 18 months on a 12 month warranty, you'd certainly have a good case against the retailer (not: *not* the manufacturer - you're contract is with the person you bought it from) 




 In the UK, your contract of purchase is with the store you bought it from and it's their responsibility to resolve the issue.

That said, many do back this service off to the manufacturer, which is OK *if* the service is acceptable.... 




 Yes, I've noticed much the same in many (but not all) of the replies on this topic.

Interesting... I wonder how much the somewhat materialistic, US-centric audience affects this?
