 The movie is Garden of Words and the setting is Shinjuku Gyoen in Tokyo. 









 Welcome to the Space Show. 




 RahXephon's "My Blue Friend" episode had me all teary eyed. 




 This is the Kamishikimi Kumanoimasu Shrine in Japan. I first saw it as the setting for the movie [Hotarubi no Mori e](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grTUkLgHwGM).

 5 cm per second. 




 The Rubinsky and Terran plots could have been done better towards the end. They were intriguing plots initially but by the fourth season they lost a lot of steam and didn't add much tension. It felt tacked on just to add some conflict.

Improvements in animation and ship design would also make the show better. Just imagine Walter von Schenkopp fight scenes with better animation and a bit more flare.

 Mir should work on his clinch game or just avoid the clinch altogether. Big Nog (2nd fight), Cormier and Carwin also bullied him in the clinch. 




 Leg extension, glute kickback machine and hamstring curls. 














 Bicyclists in NYC run the red light all the fucking time. I wouldn't even feel bad if I witness one of them run a red light then get hit by a bus. 




 No. His PB is 13.46 the 6th best time in the final is 13.43.

13.46 is not even a good enough time to qualify an American hurdler into the Olympics since America has quite a depth of talent in that event. For example the top three times in the 2012 USA Oympic trials are 12.93, 12.98 and 13.08.

 Or he scored the first round a 10-7. 




 Everyone's screaming about 30-25 but the 30-27's are bad too. How those judges did not score round one a 10-8 is mind boggling. 




 Two knockdowns and some beat downs in between those knockdowns, yeah pretty much a 10-8 but you never know with these judges. 









 Go home and be a family man.

 NFL TV deals are nationwide. The league itself signs those deals with CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN then redistribute some of that money to the teams. In the NBA and MLB the TV deals are regional. The team itslef negotiate those deals, not the league, which makes revenue sharing difficult because teams are looking out for their own. 




 [Wolf Children](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Children). 









 It made me feel so many emotions; joy, melancholy, sympathy, worried and relief. 



















 Pistol squats. Doing weighted pistols for 3x8, one leg at a time is freaking exhausting. 




 For those unaware, Shinkai also wrote a manga and a novel adaptation. The manga has great extensive character development on Kanae, Akari and Risa. IMO the novel has a better depiction of adult Takaki than the manga and the movie.

[In the novel adult Takaki wasn't that hung up on Akari, some memories and feelings would pop up but he didn't hold on to them like he did in the manga and the movie. He even admitted to falling in love with other women. But being heart broken at such an early age seemed to have left a lasting mark on him which led to him giving up on relationships when things get tough.](/spoiler) 




 It had a happy ending but what stuck out the most was the sad part. The scene where Asuna was running on the shallow river really got to me. 




 [] (/s "You've got to keep in mind how old they were and their situation. They were just thirteen, dealing with such strong emotions at such a young age could make one apprehensive and scared. Add the fact that they were about to move away from each other which makes expressing their feelings even more difficult. I think most adults would have trouble with the same situation.")

[] (/s "As for keeping in touch, they did try but the letters/texts were just not enough. The manga went over this really well, they both just shied away from the difficulties the distance provided. It's hard to expect two teenagers to try their best to make a long distance relationship work.") 




 I rewatched it a couple of days ago and I had to close that youtube link only a few seconds in. 




 http://i.imgur.com/m6dzIUl.gif 




 I recommend reading the manga also. Perhaps read it prior to rewatching the movie. The manga has added dialogue and scenes that does a great job of developing the characters better than the movie which also makes it all the more depressing.

 Space Battleship Yamato 2199 and Kyousogiga. I love the 70's vibe, the militaristic sound and the use of brass instruments in Yamato 2199...really got me pumped for the huge battles. While Kyousogiga's music hit that sentimental spot. 




 Space Battleship Yamato 2199 














 Nyahaha
 









 The series is set in the same universe as [The Princess and the Pilot movie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qomwjPIerM). 









 I love how Gintama manges to make juvenile humor funny again. These are the type of humor that you feel like you have moved on from as you got older but then you see something like Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon and Peen-san and you just can't help but burst out laughing. 




 The whole harem arc. Also any Shinpachi romance arc is hilarious. 




 Resident Evil is a popular Japanese made game so there's a decent brand recognition.  









 The filler and non-filler episodes prior to the Kyoto arc weren't good either but the ones past the Kyoto arc really are an absolute bore. Well I guess the the Shougo Arc was some what decent. 




 To anyone who played the VN, which route do you think is the anime taking?

I don't mind being spoiled. 




 Despite being selfish and not doing what's best for both Touma and Haruki, Setsuna is still the most honest one of the group therefore my best girl.

This show keeps going through tonal shifts. From lighthearted beginnings of a hero, to full blown tokusatsu cheese then to something dark.

I hope we get some background info on King Torture because right now he comes off as a random evil genius.

 Touma's train stop is at Iwazu-cho which is in Okazaki. She flew from Okazaki to Tokyo. 




 I think Haruki is overcompensating. He realizes he has feelings for Touma which makes him feel guilty so he compensates for that by rushing his relationship with Setsuna hoping it would drown out whatever he feels for Touma. 









 I'm so confused by this show right now. I thought the show was starting to hit its stride in ep. 6 and in the second half of 7. I was starting to have a grasp on what direction the show is going then this wacky tonal shift happened.

I'm just hoping for a payoff that would make sense and justify this tonal shift in a gratifying manner.

 Gintama has some heart wrenching moments too. [This dog story](http://vimeo.com/38013872) was such a tearjerker, almost as good as Futurama's Jurassic Bark. 









 Holy shit I don't know how to respond to this.

I was half expecting the show to go Steins;Gate on us, which means having a slow build up leading to shit hitting the fan really fast but I didn't expect the show to go full blown superhero.

I'll go with a wait and see approach before I react to this. 




 Robert de flato 


































 Space Battleship Yamato 2199 is my runaway AOTY. 









 [They're following the Gintama strategy](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/070/4/9/gintama_yaoi_motivational_by_sweetshounenai-d3bdrp2.jpg)

edit: FYI Gin and Goto share the same voice actor. 




 Oh man, this episode was hilarious. It also did a fine job of showing Masayoshi's dedication and pure intentions in a charming way without coming off corny or overly preachy.

Another thing I liked was Mari's little slip of the tongue about letting off steam, I guess that confirms she's really in it for thrill and excitement.

Also Gotobro exuded so much broness in this episode.

I need more Sumi screentime. 














 This was an excellent episode but then again most things about Yamato 2199 are excellent. More people should watch this show! 




 Reaper and Pushing Daisies, both have the quirkiness and eccentricity that might be better expressed in anime form. Also Better Off Ted as a SOL anime.

Maybe I'm just mentioning shows I felt were canceled so abruptly.  









 Moe waiting for a kiss from Mari was funny.

I like how both Mari and Masayoshi hit a lull in their superhero career and how they dealt with it differently. Masayoshi's passion for heroism was starting to fade and he was becoming jaded, then he realized he's doing this not for fun, not for the hero ego boost but for justice. While Mari was just getting bored since she has little purpose other than entertainment so she dealt with her boredom by upping the ante of her antics.

Looks like both Goto and Hazama will find a common sense of purpose and really start working together. 














 I'm surprised there were no Faye Valentine versions. The Haruhi bunny costume one was the best. 














 as expected akira loses to mori

I'm glad they didn't drag that out into a love triangle. The romance was unobtrusive and served as a good complement to the main story. 




 The Walking Dead is mainstream. The ratings for last season were high and this season's are even better. 




 Highly recommended anime. [Watch it here.](http://kissanime.com/Anime/Space-Battleship-Yamato-2199) 














 If the gif can fit in that 2mb limit without being a gif for ants or a grainy mess due to low image quality. 









  I mean, this show is about a treasure hunt basically, but this episode didn't include any part of the treasure-hunting! I'm feeling like the show doesn't really know how much time they should spend on characterization that is not the best I've ever seen but still, fairly standard.

Totally agreed with this. The lack of balance between character development and storytelling leads to pretty bad pacing. As a result the treasure just conveniently shows up instead of being discovered. Then there are these random action scenes that just pop up out of nowhere with very little set up.

Despite these glaring flaws I can't get myself to drop this show. 




 Crotch shots is cheap humor but the show somehow made it work. I guess the character, sound effects and the delivery are what got a laugh out of me.

I'm still enjoying this but it's the Goto and Masayoshi dialogue that made the show engaging and it's kind of veering away from that. Also it feels a bit directionless, other than character introductions the main story has been stagnant. I hope we see more progression since most of the main cast have been established.

 Some of the more recent Ghibli movies are pretty underrated.

From Up on Poppy Hill [(Watch it here)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQD4VH4Drvk)

Arrietty 




 **Wolf Children.** It's a sentimental and emotionally moving movie about a young mother raising her two kids that are part wolf in the Japanese countryside.

[Here's some stills](http://imgur.com/a/7yBMB)

[Watch it here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7H0Vcl8kIw)

Also check out Le jour des corneilles (The Day Of Crows). It's a very sweet french animation movie. 














 With that much muscle mass I highly doubt he neglected developing glamour muscles like the chest. Some people are just lacking genetically in certain areas. 









 Synopsis:

Hana is a 19-year-old student who falls in a "fairy-tale like" love with a "wolf man". Over the course of the 13-year story Hana gives birth to two children - older sister Yuki, and younger brother Ame, or "Snow and Rain". At first the family quietly lives in the city trying to hide their wolf heritage, but when the "wolf man" suddenly dies Hana makes the decision to move to a rural town, far from their previous city life. 









 They would all get it...get congratulations for graduating.

As for non-Ghibli movies I'd recommend [Hotarubi no Mori e](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grTUkLgHwGM) and Wolf Children. 














 Squeeze play.

 Turn on the close caption. 
























 Three point shooting is horrendous for both teams but the Nets are actually getting good looks. 




 Classic Mushishi bitter-sweetness.

I love the metaphorical use of the cold and snow to express Toki's feeling of numbness after losing his sister. Then use Tae's warmth to express the feeling of caring and comfort that helped Toki to move on. Very simple but well executed. 




  believe-in-yourself motivational nonsense

Sure it's overplayed in the sports genre (across all mediums) but I wouldn't call it nonsene. Top athletes don't reach the highest level of their craft without self-confidence, self-motivation and being pushed by someone. 




 In terms of romance:

Cross Game

Nana

Honey and Clover 




 Chaika could be another case of the lesser hyped Bones' show being the better one. Too bad it doesn't have the Noragami production values. 




 Sigh. No English subs. I was hoping to add this to my Spring schedule. Oh well, I'll just watch the movie series whenever it comes up in my backlog. 




 Shedding manly tears has been passed down the Armstrong line for generations. 




 Oh boy, I started welling up when I read the "God please..." line. The notion that's she's begging in her diary to remember all these memories was just so sad. 




 This show has an AMAZING soundtrack. 




 The way this show presents different story elements is so disjointed. There's just too much stuff going and the show is not doing much in a way of making sense of them. It was kind of forgivable after the 1st episode but after the 2nd one it becomes worrisome.

I hope there's some sort of pay-off here that would justify the chaotic storytelling.

 




 Mushishi is so good at building human relationships and drama in just 20 minutes. 




 I hope this convinces Sunrise to make another season of Gintama. 




 Better hops than VC but VC throws it down with more authority. 




 Holy crap that episode must have been expensive. The animation, background and character detail, and the lighting/shadowing were all on point. The slow-mo stuff also looked smooth and that means more frames of animation which of course is expensive.

That flashback was really really well done. Great editing and timely use of good music. That might be one of the best implementation of flashbacks I've seen in anime. 




 I think he's like a more evil version of Takamura. 




 That gave me bit of Kiki's Delivery Service vibe. A magical country girl unfamiliar with the city environment. 




 Too much going on for a first episode and a bit overwhelming.

Laying out a bunch of story elements in the first episode is a neat idea though. 




 That hand to hand combat looked good. Nice choreography. 




 Brewers have a really nice ballpark and a very fan friendly atmosphere and amenities. Also people like to go out in the Spring/Summer and baseball can be seen as a leisurely outdoor pastime. Keeping those in mind, with the right marketing you can get people to show up at the ballpark for a mediocre team. 




 Well, that was quick. 




 A relaxing episode about sake. A nice way to reintroduce the show before delving into the bitter-sweet stories.

I also liked how this episode adds to the mushi mythos. 




 /r/anime has been doing seasonal polls since Fall 2012, I think. Here's the [Fall 2013 Poll.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1uxekm/ranime_aoty_2013_aots_fall_2013_poll_results/)

 Read the first post of that thread. Or you can read the article I posted.

Japanese animation sales rose 6.5% to 78.99 billion yen (about US$768.4 million) in 2013 to its highest total in six years. Sales of foreign animation for the general public and children were 6.191 billion yen (US$60.2 million), and foreign and domestic animation sales combined were 85.17 billion yen (US$828.5 million).

 Spring and Summer seasons always get the good stuff. 




 What a scare. Should've tried harder to deny Monta from getting the ball. 




 Livingston got away with a lot of grabbing and pulling there. 




 Damn Caesar is OP. 




 The manga sales are excellent so the Japanese do like this type of story. It's just not the type of series that garners fandom and get people to buy blurays and merchandise.

Also this is late night anime so ratings don't matter.  









 I was half expecting to see the Gintama spoof of who wants to be a millionaire. 




 And it's mostly fairly well known animes. These lists would be more interesting if they're recommending niche shows like Otana Joshi, Flag, Beast Player Erin and etc. 




 This arc has been amazing.

Ippo and Silver Spoon have been providing some quality writing and character drama for the past few weeks. 




 Personally I found Courtesan of a Nation to be the best arc. 




 I love how you left out the fact that prior to the takedown Hendricks was landing consecutive punches and kicks on a gassed out and hurt Lawler. 




 The intro to the this episode was great. A prime example of how this show can seamlessly transition from serious moments to comedic ones.

The writing, pacing and character progression have been superb. The dialogue and the way characters react are believable and genuinely heartfelt. This is one of the few shows that handle emotional moments in a natural and sincere way, right along with shows like Mushishi, Cross Game, Natsume and a few others. 









 All of a sudden this show turns into a psychological thriller. I think the second half has handled the transition between tonal shifts a lot better than the first half. 









 This felt good after the way the Nets lost to Raps in the last game. 




 Blatche with some horrendous defense. 




 Lowry is really pushing his luck with the refs. Surprisingly they have been patient with him. 




 Ugh, I was really hoping it wouldn't do the "beat some sense into him" cliche. That was just bad writing because Ignacio barely exists as a character and all of a sudden he's playing a significant role in the MC's life this late in the season. It also robbed us of a possible good interaction between Kal and Ariel since it really should've been Ariel talking some sense into him. Really, the best thing this anime has going for it is the relationship between Ariel and Kal, and in a very important moment it decided to go away from it.

Pretty disappointed with this show since I really, really liked The Princess and the Pilot. 




 I find myself sometimes saying "Oy, Oy, Oy" like Gintoki does. 




 Nobunaga you spectacular bastard. I love the over the top confidence, the hubris and the grandiose. It's such a nice change of pace from other MCs.  




 This episode made me want a serious period drama anime. 




 Nets broadcast team can be hilarious at times. 

I want to see how an Ian Eagle and JVG duo would work out. 




 But damn, you can't just end it in the middle of a **well deserved ass whoopin.**

I dunno about that, the guy just found out the girl he loves is partly responsible for his parents' death. His emotional response is completely understandable. If this goes the "beat some sense into him" route then it would be some pretty bad writing.

 Oh man, I love Nodame. Great Romcom. 




 I love that little bit of introspection by Hachiken about running away might have been a good thing but it doesn't mean the problem just disappears.

Also for anyone who enjoyed the baseball part, I recommend that you go watch **Cross Game!** 




 This might be my favorite fight in the series. I really like how it emotionally escalates right along with the intensity of the fight. 














 This show is making me realize how uncreative I was during my toy playing days. 









 Even though Yukine is being a little brat, I still feel bad for him. It doesn't exactly help that Yato is as personable and empathetic as a cardboard box, and is not being a good friend/parental figure to Yukine.

After a few episodes that made me want to smack Yukine, this episode actually made me sympathize or at the very least empathize with him. Also you're right about Yato, despite his good intentions of wanting to reform Yukine and not give up on him, he really hasn't handled the situation gracefully. 




 Yukine seems to have some abandonment issues. Nora showing up and making Yukine think Yato could leave him for her seems to be the catalyst to this whole mess.

Yato knows this and doesn't want to give up on him maybe for atonement, or maybe out of compassion. 




 I like Eagle. I found myself rooting for him.

That cliff hanger though. 




 He should hire a PR person. 




 Space Battleship Yamato 2199 and Garden of Words. Both are excellent. 




 Space Battleship Yamato 2199. It's an excellent space opera not just for an anime but across other mediums. Also, IMO the far and away best anime in 2013.

Go watch it!

 Damn, shit just got real serious all of a sudden. I approached this as a "turn my brain off and just enjoy" anime but this episode is making me think otherwise. 




 Robot Family is hilarious, best episode so far. 




 That was kind of a lame fight, no tension whatsoever. I understand it's a set up episode but a whole episode about a dominant win is boring. 




 That Mari and Mizuki argument is really well written and acted. The dialogue genuinely expressed anger and frustration...then we see Moe wearing a paper bag and then yuri. Haha, only this show can troll you like that. 









 The goofiness of this episode reminded a bit of Gintama, especially the [manboarding bit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAqo1mNq15A). I didn't mind it at all and thought it was amusing until the exposition dump, which came off as forced and felt like last minute story telling. 




 There's been too many flashbacks, the show might have just as well started from the very beginning then just do a time skip. I think the pacing would've been better that way but obviously that would eliminate the twist.

Those aerial scenes looked good, pretty obvious that's where a lot of the budget is going. 




 Caesar is a big believer in ~~love~~ kidnap at first sight. 




 I've read that the American companies were overpaying for licenses with total disregard for quality but hearing some of those titles really put things in perspective on how crazy the bubble got.

 I wonder if the BD is going to have a less censored version of the bath scene just like Monogatari did...you know for science. 




 The Japanese aren't big time purchasers of DVD/BDs so it makes sense to maximize price in a limited market.


This [ANN article](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-07) explains it better:

The High Prices... Explained!

To a Westerner, the Japanese DVD market seems horribly overpriced. With the average disc running over 7,000 (US$92) and only containing 2-4 episodes of a series, the cost of collecting a single show can easily run several hundred dollars -- more than many American fans spend in a single year. 

The prices actually stem from a business practice we used to have in America, too: rental pricing. Basically, back in the dawn of the home video business, the industry was constructed in a way where "niche" releases were only meant to sell a few thousand copies, mostly to video rental shops. Prices were high (typically $89.95 in America), but video shops benefited from having a wide and semi-exclusive selection of movies that normal people would never pay for. At those prices, only a few thousand sales could mean over a million dollars of revenue. Initially, video industry people didn't think there was much of a market in selling to collectors. 

But the fans proved them wrong. Otaku of all kinds (not just anime fans) started buying the videotapes and laserdiscs, and they bought them at those high prices that were intended just for video stores. There was no reason to lower it. **In fact, there were a few experiments to drop the price to a more affordable amount, but that usually resulted in a slight increase in sales -- not enough to make up for the drop in revenue.**

When you think about it, that makes sense. Most Japanese people live in much smaller homes, and with many more people than their Western counterparts. In most cases, it simply doesn't make sense for Japanese consumers to build a big home media library. Only the hardcore fans of a particular product will usually want to bother owning a tape or DVD, and everyone else relies on rental shops. Media is a specialty market, not a mass-market one, so prices have stayed astronomically high. 

The Japanese Otaku's desire to own anime even at high prices had an unexpected effect: as the rest of the economy tanked and video stores stopped buying every new video release, the otaku kept buying pretty much everything that got released. Before long, the few thousand fans that bought anime DVDs were supporting nearly the entire budget of a show. Even as the rest of the Japanese home video industry lowered their prices to varying degrees, anime stayed at the same high price. It's simply the only way most shows can ever make a profit. 




 Mr. Justice is a spammer.

This show is INSANE, INSANE, INSANE. The whole From Beyond thing being an elaborate hoax doesn't really explain the PM going all super saiyan. 




 [](/s "I could never bring myself to say it but...Yuichi, I've always...loved you.")

[](/s "***smashes snow bunny***") 









 I feel the same. 




 I'm gonna be avoiding Sportcenter tonight, don't wanna see that ending again.

I wanted this win bad not just for the standings but for more momentum heading into the games against OKC and Indiana. 




 Fuck. Fuck. That fucking hurt. Fuck. 




 I wonder how much change the Wind Revolution brought. The class divide still seems to be prevalent and the end result was a transfer of power from one blue blood to another. 









 All of a sudden romcom love triangle. The absurdity is pretty entertaining. 




 Dat David Eagle ass. 




 I know how Ookawa-senpai feels. 




 It's from the 2nd movie. 









 Grown up Kagura made a comeback in the latest movie but [](/s "with smaller boobs.") 









 This was in the front page of /r/pics a couple of weeks ago.

I love the fact that love hotel is real.

 Eh? Nothing that has transpired so far made me think that she should die and that's the only way to end things. There's still so many unanswered questions about her role. 

Killing off a characters can be cliche also and if not done properly can be seen as a cheap attempt for a tear jerker. 









 The enemy has some faulty designed mechas lol.

Betrothed to his sister and now to a loli. Also with a cross dressing love interest on the side. Nobunaga is like Araragi with a mecha. 




 That's a fabulous pose. 














 The underwear song is pretty catchy. That Satan skit is pretty amusing, it got me with the "please deliver me from paper" line.  




 Damn, just reading this speculation hit right in the feels. 




 This show with its roller coaster ride of tonal shifts is playing with my emotions. 









 The bomber being linked to the teacher/bullying felt tacked on. This episode didn't do as good of a job as the first episode in terms of intertwining different cases together. 




 Usagi Drop, Honey Clover and Cross Game are all on Hulu. 




 [In the OP there's a little girl cuddled up with little Kal-el.](http://i.imgur.com/AOmivlF.jpg) Hmmm, I wonder if that's Claire. If that's true and she's also Nina Viento then this might get interesting.  




 I hope it avoids the imouto route but I guess it fits in with the insanity. Maybe the term "sister" means something else lol.

 The best they can do is being done already and that is being available on Crunchy, Hulu, Netflix and having some shows in toonami. Late night anime used to be available on cable TV like Sci-fi Channel and Tech-TV/G4 but those channels are niche. Even in those niche channels anime couldn't draw a decent enough audience to be kept on air.

The only anime that hit mainstream are children's shows like Pokemon, Digimon, DBZ and etc. That's back when children's shows in general were popular, when Kid's WB, Fox Kids and afternoon Toonami existed. Those days are long gone.

Non-sitcom animation for adults in general has always been niche. Archer is on a relevant cable network and in its four seasons has never reached 2 million viewers. If an American made animation of that type can't hit mainstream then anime doesn't have much of a chance



  




 Late night anime has always been niche. Obviously there has been a few exceptions like Eva, AoT, Haruhi, Madoka and a few others but for the most part the audience will always be limited due to the time slot. 




 Ononoki with that posed look. 




 Yeah, the slice of life stuff is a nice breather or palette cleanser in between the intense fights. 




 That's adorable. I'd watch a show about a girl and her pet alpaca.

This makes me wanna rewatch [Bunny Drop](http://www.hulu.com/bunny-drop). 




 While watching GITS: SAC:

"This is a really complex and intelligent show but what does the Major have against wearing pants?"

The low numbers for Space Battleship Yamato 2199 saddens me.
 




 The whole movie is one big setup for a Shinpachi glasses joke.

 I enjoy the roller coaster ride but some of the transitionary episodes in between the tonal changes are a bit unexciting. 




 The humor is kind of dull but I see some potential due to the unique premise. Some comedy shows take some time to pick up steam like Gintama which took me about 3-5 episodes to really get into.

I'll give this the 3 episode treatment and if it improves I might keep watching. 




 Did the show just referenced Cross Game, because I think it did and it put a smile on my face.

Also [TIL](http://i.imgur.com/SKblCJE.jpg) about cow bra.

 I like how the three jobs merged into one, I thought that was clever. The characters have a good dynamic between them which produced some really funny moments. Then of course, there's also the action and the music. Best premiere so far this season, looks like it's going to be a fun show. 




 Since you liked this one, here's a few suggestions from the same genre:

Usagi Drop (series)

Wolf Children (movie)

Honey Clover (series)

5 Centimeters Per Second (movie)

Garden of Words (movie)

Girl Who Leapt Through Time (movie)

From Up on Poppy Hill (movie)

[Hotarubi no Mori e](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grTUkLgHwGM) (movie)

Cross Game (series) - sports anime but the drama is excellent



 




 Watch The Princess and the Pilot, this series is a spin-off of that movie. It has the romance in the sky vibe that's a bit reminiscent of Laputa: Castle in the Sky. 




 The anime is [Anohana](http://www.hulu.com/anohana-the-flower-we-saw-that-day). The location is Chichibu. 




 man that romance was a little rushed with that "grab her as she falls ,stare into each others eyes and embrance" scene.

Yeah, that escalated way too quickly and came off kind of cheesey. A nice dialogue where they share a few laughs would have suffice in establishing the romance.

 









 Those CG mechs didn't look so good. The show's world building seems fairly interesting though. 




 I guess that was alright. The animation was great towards the end but the humor fell flat with the exception of the circle joke. 




 Kino's Journey season 2, please. 




 I was so happy when I noticed it's a double episode. The show sold Sawamura's bait pretty well.
