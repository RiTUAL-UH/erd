 There were some notes on windows phone 7 but I haven't read through them yet. I'll make a note to go check it out. 




 While the formatting on most of those is garbage it might be easier than this big txt file, I'll play with it thanks for the link. 




 I had thought maybe I would use admob for mobile ads but goddamnit I hate ads. So for now I don't want any money. If for whatever crazy reason hosting gets expensive I'll worry about that then.

 You bastard. 




 That would be pretty awesome. I'll look into it as soon as I've made my way through the MASSIVE amount of books still left to add.

Also if anyone knows how to quickly do it chime in as I'm sure it will be a while before I get to it, though I do want to get to it. 




 or use apps like [securely](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/securely-password-vault/id470475299?mt=8), [1password](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-for-iphone/id285897618?mt=8), [splashid](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/splashid-safe-for-iphone/id284334840?mt=8) etc.

 Do this:
Restart everything and flush your cache by opening terminal and type dscacheutil -flushcache
That should take care of your troubles. And if not, I'm so sorry, because iOS 5 is amazing.

Make sure you flush everything with itunes closed. After that reopen and it should all work.

 My wife loved it :) Now I just need to buy a crazy over priced custom frame and I'll send you a photo of it up.

 Holy hell that was awesome. 




 For reproduction you are probably best going with something like blurb or lulu. Here is an example of an artbook project I just finished with a bunch of other artists. Granted this one was all digital work submitted to me in an approved template, but you can see the final pdf's, images of the printed work from blurb and how it is setup for sale (no profits are made on this).

 I like how grumpy the viewer looks in the 5th picture down. 





























 I'm not the best at getting my thoughts written down. I thought I made the point that if you have been designing for a while it is part of the natural progression of things, or at least it seems that way for me.

A huge portion of my job recently when developing apps or websites is the UX end of things, and it naturally lead to choosing to do that full time as opposed to just doing it along with developing the UI and actually building it all (html, javascript, Xcode etc).

If your job already has you doing these things, and you enjoy that end of it, then you should consider doing it full time as it is a good way to step into a higher position and make more money. I should have been more clear on that point. I didn't mean to come across as saying you should do UX only for the money, as in my experience that is one of the last reasons to do work. I think I actually had an entire section about doing work you enjoy but my friend who read through the article told my I had too many tangents :) 




 Sorry I've been in the digital end of design for so long now I just assume everyone knows what it is :)

Part of my new years resolution is to "not be such a shitty writer" and I suppose part of that is not making assumptions about the audience. It actually took me most of the day to write this. I didn't know getting my thoughts out on 'paper' was so difficult. 




 It's partly an exaggeration..

 I didn't realize cafepress was still around. Maybe take a look at society6, I've been using them for a while for art prints and the quality of their work is pretty great.

 They were tiny wrestlers. I don't remember what they were from or why I had them, but they were awesome and were always in the sandbox with my hotwheels and micro machines. 




 Thats good thats actually what I was drawing. 









 You're right, what was I thinking :( 














 I went from an Intuos3 to a cintiq and I'm happy with the switch. The intuos is a bit faster and more responsive, but I only have a 21UX. I imagine the new 24hd and 24hd touch are better.

I still love drawing on the screen more than on the intuos, but as you said the price jump is pretty significant.

 I've been doing a lot of pixel art work the last few weeks for a new project, trying to get back into the style. I love this series by [Nina Geometrieva](https://www.behance.net/gallery/What-Space-Really-Looks-Like/12984019) and did a small 8bit version for practice.

 I can understand wanting to read all the comments at once like you're used to. From a writing standpoint it's nice because I get to see what part of the writing people are commenting about. 

Here is an example from this article. I had a sentence that made no sense and the comment system allowed me to see exactly what the commenter was writing about.

 Yeah, but I'm not a good writer. 




 I just downloaded a pdf of all the books so I can read them on the kindle sans internet :)

 It isn't legal but by the time the developer gets a cease and desist from Nintendo they will hopefully have made some money from ads and collected a lot of user data. To comply with the cease and desist they will just change the offending art and the game will keep its users after the update.  




 That's a wonderful testament to patience, something I am constantly trying to improve.  




 I agree with qwert in that it would be great to see more contrast, especially at the end where something is illuminating the way forward. It's a well done piece composition wise. 




 I have this terrifying dream once a year or so still. I graduated high school in 1998 too. When will it end?  




 This looks like a fun subreddit. How do you request an invite for private subreddits? I hope it is an involved process requiring animal sacrifice. 




 It sounds like you have already made up your mind to use this opportunity to pursue new work. As you develop more as a designer you'll find that money isn't the only motivator anymore. It's great when you find a place to work that has a great culture and shares the same values as you. Keep that in mind on your job hunt, though I also understand that sometimes it can be so bad that anywhere else is better than where you are :)  




 This is beautiful.  




 I think the only rules in advertising are that you can't tell an outright lie. Otherwise advertisers can pump out whatever paying consumers are willing to be influenced by. All religions advertise, some are just better about using the right sort of media to reach an audience.

My assumption, based on no research what-so-ever, is that a large part of football loving american families are christian to some degree. It is probably easier to convince someone who believes in one religion to switch if they are 'losing faith', than it is to convince someone who has no belief system to suddenly get one. 




 You have opened an entirely new world to me :O 




 Oh cool thanks I'll check this out. 




 I think [this tool](https://www.hotdoor.com/cadtools) has an isometric grid but I didn't want to pay several hundred dollars for it. 




 I've never worked with blends, googling now thanks :)

 I've been working in it for a long time now, but there are some quirks that drive me bonkers. Snapping is a big one. Nothing EVER snaps correctly in illustrator. Whether that is because I am not using settings correctly (enable pixel grid, snap to point, snap to grid, sub snap settings like snap to selection or snap to art board omg) or Illustrator has just had awful snap detection I do not know. I suspect it is just illustrator trying to make me angry.

Regardless of some of the crazy things about Illustrator it really is a powerful piece of software and allows me (and other much more talented artists) to do really neat work.

There are an almost unlimited amount of free tutorials out there on youtube and artists' websites for you to learn. I just recently read Vector Basic Training by Von Glitschka and it was excellent. It has a lot of basic stuff in it and he does a good job of explaining how and why he does certain things. 




 I use so many keys I actually got a 2nd bluetooth keyboard that I use on [top of my wacoms](http://instagram.com/p/ZWDCftlPBs).

I had a medium intuos I just recently sold because I found I was using my small one (in addition to the cintiq) and never the medium one. I had bought the small one at first to work while traveling and found that it was really all I needed. I think I may tend to draw small anyway in my moleskines though, so it really is a preference thing I think.

The nice thing about most retailers now is they take returns on hardware for at least 7 days, and in some cases (like amazon) up to a month after purchase. Try one out and if you don't like it swap it for a different one. 




 I've had great luck from americasprinter throughout the years. If you want high quality (higher cost) papers and letterpress check out dolcepress.com 




 This is good advice. Go out into the real world to conventions, meetups etc. You will make valuable connections who will have advice and possibly work for you. Social networking is great but it still doesn't compare to meatspace networking. 




 Wacom recently rebranded the bamboo to intuos, and the intuos to intuos pro. When the bamboo first came out it had driver issues and was very unresponsive and I couldn't recommend it to anyone. I have not tried the newer versions but they may be much better. If you have less than $100 you may want to try one of those. Maybe get one on amazon and if you don't like it send it back.

If you have $250 to spend the small intuos pro is amazing. I have a 24" cintiq touch I use every day and I still use my small intuos pro several times a week. The intuos is super responsive and has almost no lag (compared to my cintiq which has some lag when I'm doing quick sketches.) If my intuos were to break I would immediately get another one. 




 Every couple of months I find a unique style in something that catches my eye, whether it's a form of illustration, design style, painting style etc, and I copy the style incorporating my own content into it. I don't ever do it for clients or for money, it is mostly just to learn and practice something new (or something I haven't done in a while.)

An example right now is isometric pixel art. I actually have a client that wants this form of illustration for a project, and I have done it before, but I'm out of practice. Right now I plan on doing a few illustrations just for personal practice before jumping fully into the project.

I like browsing behance and dribbble for styles that I have no clue how to do, and I try to copy it as closely as possible. After I feel like I have a better understanding of the style I then try to make my own content in the same style.

It's not really a design challenge that other people ever see, it's more just for myself, but it works well for me :)

 When my wife had our new baby the hospital we used had a birthing center there, so if something did go wrong it was a room away from doctors with lots of equipment and tools. We didn't look into any other birthing centers so I'm not sure how many of them differ or if they aren't part of a hospital. 









 I've never seen your stuff before. I really like it all :) How do you make time to do comics if you have a kid though :( 




 I actually came here to post that line:

"2.	We shouldve noticed that the photo used in the blog wasnt up to par. It just wasnt a good shot, and there are about 5,000 others wouldve been better suited for the post. "

Sounds like someone is upset they got caught stealing an artists work. If I did have any sympathy for the blog who is making ad money on articles using parts of other peoples work, it vanished at that point. 




 You won't be living out of your car if you don't focus on interaction, though it would probably make you more marketable. There are a lot of companies that still need good print designers (I just finished up a contract for a large trade show company) and the work is fun and rewarding. When I have tough decisions like this to make I tend to lean toward the one that I would enjoy more and it has served me well in life.
