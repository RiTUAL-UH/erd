 As I said Earlier: I think that Alfred Willowhawk would really dig that response. This response is great. I have cross posted this to a couple of subreddits, and this is one of the most astute answers I have seen. Kudos and gold if I had it.

 




 /u/ChairmanMaoffin had an awesome thing to say on this 
 Evidenced-based medicine has been proposed and accepted as a more accurate name for western or conventional medicine because it describes what we do- utilize the most evidenced-based preventions and treatments for patients

I think that Alfred Willowhawk would really dig that response. What I got from this article was less about what types of medicine work for who, and more about how our terminology is aggressive and detrimental to the goal of finding the best method for treating each individual.


 




 As we close on this flu season; a word on the Conventional Medicine v Alternative Medicine, and how those terms can subconsciously break down our trust in medical procedures not labeled "Conventional". Really enjoyed this article.

Abstract

Gethin G, Cowman S. Case series of use of Manuka honey in leg ulceration. Abstract The historical and current literature reports the successful use of honey to manage a diversity of wound aetiologies. However, only in the last 40 years is research on its mode of action and contribution to wound healing being investigated. The challenge of managing chronic non healing wounds generated interest in researching non standard therapies. The aims of the study were to gain insight into the practical use of Manuka honey in wound management. The objective was to test the feasibility of further rigorous research into the use of honey in the management of chronic wounds. Instrumental case series were used to examine the use of Manuka honey in eight cases of leg ulceration. To collect the necessary data, photographs, acetate tracings, data monitoring and patient comments and observations were used to add greater reliability and validity to the findings. The wounds were dressed weekly with Manuka honey. The results obtained showed three males and five females with ulceration of different aetiologies were studied. A mean initial wound size for all wounds of 5.62 cm(2) was obtained. At the end of four-week treatment period, the mean size was 2.25 cm(2). Odour was eliminated and pain reduced. The conclusions drawn were that the use of Manuka honey was associated with a positive wound-healing outcome in these eight cases. Arterial wounds showed minimal improvement only." 




 This is correct. The idea of the article was that the lable of "alternative" has unfairly garnered the co-definition of "ineffective". Manuka honey on a staph infection heals it.  Even science agrees with that,  but its considered "alternative" because they can't patent honey and sell it for an exorbitant amount of money. The thing that I most agreed with was this assertion that our terminology may be out of date.  




 They call medicine that has worked for thousands of years in Asia "alternative" here in the west.

 An article for the perusal of the Pagan community who are interested in, or study, or would like to take sometime reading about Egyptian based Wicca and Theology. Reposted from /r/wicca 









 I thought you all would enjoy seeing this cross post from the Wiccan community on /r/wicca who are interested in, study, and revere the ancient gods of Egypt.   









 Another article for the perusal of the Wiccan community who is interested in, or study, or would like to take sometime reading about Egyptian based Wicca and Theology.  









 I think the pressure made it impossible for him to grow and perform in Cleveland. a more laid back atmosphere and time to learn without being under the microscope might produce a great QB. We have learned that Weeden does not turn into a Diamond under pressure, he crumbles. Maybe if he is allowed to age like cheese, he will ripen to a very strong and mature QB. 




 And you would be a crappy Cowboys fan if you thought differently. Huzzah and good luck on the road to that Ring! 




 I have been trying to find a place on reddit to post these wonderful articles on the items being created for Spring Mysteries Festival (www.aquatabch.org) auction. If it gets good up-votes, I will post the rest as they come out. If not, I hope you enjoy this one for it being created by the God of Craftsmen, and I will find another place to post them. blessings and I hope you enjoy :) 









 No problem, friend :)

You saw him in college. Did you think he had the goods to be a starting NFL  QB? 




 My honest reply is "No. I would not be excited to have him." His stats dont paint a whole picture. Yes he has broken passing records. Has he broken playoff records? Also: he can spend a whole game knocking down receivers (hence his stat numbers) and then the last play of the game, the one to win it all, he throws an interception,  or a really bad throw. We have Greg Little. We would need no help choking on the final throw/catch of the game. Lol Do I hate Romo?  No. I just think he is more in league with Andy Dalton than Tom Brady.  




 I am not here to change your mind about Romo,  just to talk about Weeden. 




 Weeden is indeed a low budget choice for quarterback.  Romo is not an elite QB. I'm sorry. I've had him on my fantasy team more than once, and he has let me down time and again. I don't dislike him,  or the Cowboys,  mind you.  




 Im sure he picked him with the same "I like him. He's a good 'ol boy" mentality he keeps Romo around with. I can honestly think of no other reason he would hire him. 




 I am equally as sorry that you have to deal with JJ. 




 I apologize for having to leave the comp after I started this AMA. It seems to have been the single ruining factor. I am a minister, and I cant always predict how much time I am going to have to spend on a given appointment. I'm sorry, again. Good luck with Weeden. I was hoping to be able to shine some light on him for anyone who had questions, and mishandled the instant nature of the AMA experience. Sorry to waste your time /u/Cowboys. Maybe next time. 




 Sorry.  I'm a Minister,  and my job called.  




 Fried, Floppy, Weeden Scramble 




 That's funny right there, I dont care who you are. ;) 




 My eternal apologies. I am here and hope to make amends!
 




 All of them. :) I work in Prison Ministries on Tuesday and it had me out of the house for a couple hours. 




 He needs to learn meditation and inner peace. Once he isn't afraid of the line coming at him, or the velocity of his throw, then he will have what it takes to put it all together to be a starter. 




 Weeden has a long progression, and he gets spooked easily. Many of his drops come from him throwing it too hard. (which is only half his fault. He WAS throwing it to Bess and Little, who are not the best at actually catching the ball) His sack record has a lot to do with his inability to get rid of the ball in time, and then panicking. He had Joe Thomas, Alex Mack, Greco, Schwartz. He had some good protection. He could be really good if someone could teach him. That 2012 game was a BARN-BURNER!!! 




 I had not looked into him at all. He was NOT who I, or anyone else expected to draft. I watched his college play after the fact and have always thought that we never played to his major strength, which is the Shotgun. I have felt that we hired a polar bear, and wondered why the hell it wouldnt fly in our eagle formation, and have punished the poor dumb animal for being a polar bear who cant fly. 




 I would take him over Brady Quinn, but I would take Thad Lewis over Weeden. He has a gun that he uses too liberally when a normal throw would do, and he fluffs it when he needs to drill it to a receiver. Maybe you guys can do something with him now that he is a backup, and no longer a high profile flop. 




 The game with the Dippity-Do-Underhand-Pass-Interception on first down. It was hands down one of the top 5 worst plays in Browns History.

 I have watched it all, and I will answer any questions you may have, as honestly as I can.  




 I have been working on this project! We just found out it was the 30th year anniversary when we located all the old print copies from 30 years ago, late last month! It was like looking into a time warp, and then we saw the publish date and realized we had to stop production on a myriad other things, and produce this months worth of material on Panegyria itself.  I hope you guys like what we put out here, and I hope you learn a bit about a part of pagan history 30 years in the making. 




 Im right over the mountains past Stevens Pass. There is a  HUGE Backers group that meets in Seattle at the World Sports Grill, too. Good Luck! 




 Oh yes, fuck dem birdies. 




 I bleed Orange and BROWN. That being said: Cincinnati did right by Paul Brown, and for that I respect them. Funk dem Stillers, though. 




 I say we trade our #4 pick for a first rounder for next year (to get the QB from Oregon), and then start our draft with the sec9nd first round pick, and choose any of the WR that are filling this draft. 




 I'm not your hombre, champ 




 This morning, at around 4:30, I jumped out of bed because I had some super important stuff to do, that I was obviously late for. We sleep outside in a seperate building from the house. When I got outside and looked around the twilight yard in the darkened rain pouring on my head, I realized I had nothing to do, and was wondering wtf I thought I needed to be doing, naked in the rain, at 4:30am. This has never happened before. I have Algonquin ancestry, as well. Which I just learned is a home for the some odd the Wendigo legends. Now this comes up on reddit.  Weird.

 The Official Browns App is the single most frustrating Browns news app I have. I use Fanside, Flipboard,  and b/r (bleacher report) the only thing I like about the Official Browns App is the "Breaking News" feature. It sends an alert when big stuff happens. LomBanner firing, DeQwell being let go, etc. I mean, you cant click the alert to go read an article about the alert because the app is pretty much useless, but they still send you the alert . 




 Rev. Terry Riley of March on Ft. God fame, had many doors closed to him until he was able to affirm his training through Seminary Certification. His experience and outlook is really interesting, and may help those with questions about Seminary Training vs Coven Training.  









 This is a really cool book about European Shamanism.  This author is really thorough, and more people should enjoy Mallory. What little of him I have read I have really liked. He is very scholarly in his style, and that can be a little dry for some, but for info hounds, he is great. 









 Yes,  the parent comment to yours makes very little sense.  There is no body within Wicca that can tell anyone else how to worship.  We don't have gun toting covens going door to door kicking altars over and demanding to see your ID Card, and your depictions of Aradia and Cernunnos, as
sanctioned by the Brit Trad Collective.

 Hello, everyone. I am sharing this article here because for better or worse, for those that love Pete, and those that do not, Pierre Claveloux "Pete Pathfinder" Davis changed the face of Wicca, and these may well be his final written words to the community that he loved very much. Pete has written Menhir News even before Panegyria's inception. I hope you all enjoy what might be it's final edition. 
+Blessings 









 I am a very close and personal friend of Rev. Terry Riley of SDCW. This will be the first year since I started going to Mayday that I wont be there 




 Have we met, before? 
 




 I didn't know you knew Alfred?! He's an amazing priest 




 Gotta love the ungrateful. Bye Weeden. 




 I think that Love is the Law, and we tend to withhold love from ourselves before we withhold from other people, and this makes us victims to the one person we cant fight way. This article by Alfred Willowhawk, a 3rd Degree Gardenarian from Wite Ravyn Metaphysical Church in Missouri, is a great article tackling just that concept. Happy Imbolg, everyone.

 I bet he feels like a guy who just got a chance to race the Kentucky Derby at all. Farmer seems like the kind of guy to be grateful for his chances,  and he's going to do way better than Lombardi 




 Well with Banner at the helm, you can bet he wont make it easy to resign him. Mack is worth money, and Banner historically doesn't like to pay it out. This is worth being concerned over. 




 My grandma got me this gnome for Yule and He told me his name was Gnomar Lewzing. He says he's got this. 









 As a Die Hard Dawg, I just want to say: Ravens, I'm sorry. I cant like you. I would say "Nothing Personal" but it totally is. I would say "No offense" but I cant help it if you get offended. I CAN say: I love your coach, and I think he is the best one in the whole division. Pettine might make me proud, but Harbaugh is a good guy. You also got the better of the two brothers.

Steelers. Steelers Steelers Steelers. I dont know what happened last year. Aging team, too comfortable coaching staff, karma, I dont know. I see a serious dropping in your AFC North standings if you dont make some serious changes (which I see that you have started with the coaching staff) I think you have the dirtiest coach in the AFC North. It's true. He cheats. Boo on cheating. You know, I could go on about how I am a Browns fan and hate the Steelers, but instead I am just going to say: Good luck on the rebuild.

Bengals. We share a heritage. You took in a wonderful man whom we kicked out unfairly and finished his legacy with honor. Thank you for helping immortalize Paul Brown. You guys have a chance to make it to the Super Bowl, but you are going to have to shake the rust off that Red Rifle. Not to mention I dont even know most of the people on your O-Line. (that might be my fault for being stuck up the Brownies Butt all season) Get a better secondary receiver and maybe find the Law Firm in contempt. He didnt do much to help you last season.

The Browns are ONCE AGAIN the question mark. Maybe they will dominate with a new coach, massive cap space, and 10 draft picks with 2 in the first round. MAYBE. Or will it be same post 99 Browns, different year? I dont know. We're a mess. I think Hoyer can win, but can he? He seems to get hurt easily. I think Gordon can be a game changer, but can he? We didnt win any of the games he broke records in. I think Pettine is a good coach. But will he actually be able to lead the Factory of Sadness?  

Well, thanks for letting me bitch and posture about how I feel about the AFC North. And I will leave y'all with this: I can talk trash about the AFC North, but if you aint following one of our teams, then shut yer mouth. 

Peace, All

 So many hours into Final Fantasy VII...poor Aeris. There is just so much to do in that game, and the replay value is amazing. 




 Yes! I almost never remember what I say to people in those situations. We do a ritual called The White Goddess Ritual where the priestess in the center is veiled in white, and invokes the Bright Mother. Then everyone has a chance to come up to, hug, and get an interaction with the Goddess. This one time afterwards my partner Bella had been the one invoked, and this little girl came up and said "Can I have another hug?"

And Bella said: "Okay honey, but it wont be the same. I was invoked with Goddess last time"

Then the little girl hugged her, and kinda smacked her lips like she didnt like the taste of the tea, or something, and said: "Nah. That's not right. And you had blond hair then" and just wandered off with her mom. Bella's hair was red :) 




 Someone mentioned: ["Until you started posting your blog here I wasn't really aware of how Eleusinian the Aquarian Tabernacle Church was."](http://www.reddit.com/r/Wicca/comments/1wo46e/searching_for_the_kore_by_regina_cagle/cf3uxx0), in an earlier post. LOL Sorry about the lack of context before I started posting. We just happen to be in the middle of rehearsals for Spring Mysteries Festival, so many of these posts are blogs of what each priest/ess is going through as they work with their God forms. It's a way for people to get to see the kind of transformations that occur within the people that hold these monumental energies. I have done invocation and psychodrama for 10 years, and the changes and growth that happen through the process of working these energies is really amazing sometimes. Like Anansi says when he shares a story: "This is my story as I have told it. If it be sweet, or if it be not sweet; take some with you, and let some come back to me". One of the things I was hoping to hear from people was their experiences holding energies in their own psychodramas and rituals. I'd love to hear stories from anyone who would like to share. :)

 You're very welcome. We are moving in directions that are not nearly parallel to the ATC of the past. Are we still trying to break ground for Wiccan Rights? Yes. Are we still trying to put out the best resources we know how to? Yes. Are those resources, and ground breaking going to be done in the same manner as the past. Most likely not. We are pretty much only ATC in name and possessions.

Talking about the Seminary: The Seminary has been staffed by hand picked teachers (many of which are not a part of the ATC Mother Church in WA, but by teachers from all over the country, and some not associated with the ATC through anything except the Seminary) by Bella for the past 5 years. Not only that, but the Seminary doesnt teach a tradition. We teach what are the Sacred Sciences behind magic. We leave it to the individual group leaders to teach a tradition. We also do not Initiate through the school (because it is mostly online) though a student has the ability to find a local teacher because of the scope of the ATC affiliate network.

The ATC cant decide to not use it's name any longer. The disaster that would come in the wake of such a decision would be apocalyptic. It's not just us in Washington anymore. The dissolution of the ATC would effect thousands of congregants world wide. The name (as besmirched as it may be in certain circles) is connected to Governmental infrastructures that would disenfranchise dozens of groups that depend on us if we were to not maintain the Umbrella Document as it is written.

It was only through all of the infrastructure the ATC built that we were able to get legal churches in the Mid-South. Tennessee Religious law is INSANE. It is made to keep non-Abrahamic religions out of the loop. It's actually only because of the legitimacy of the seminary that The Jenny Jones Show (I need citation on the actual show. Might be Sally Jesse Raphael, might be Maury Povich. Terry Riley knows) said they would be willing to call Terry "Rev. Terry Riley" and not "Self Proclaimed Witch Terry Riley". It's a crazy story that I would love to get my hands on and post here. 

At this stage in the game, the only hope I have is by changing a complete culture that some people see within the organization that I love. There was a time when it was run my a closed fist. We could not do things more differently if we were an open hand. Love is our law, and just like the reputation that I have learned of, was built brick by brick, action by action, so shall it be disassembled. The ATC was ever only supposed to bring legitimacy and resources to the community, and as I sit here and tell you now please believe me: That is how the world will see it when I am done. 

Blessings to you, and I hope I have done some to help you have, maybe, a glimmer of hope that the Aquarian Tabernacle Churches future will make you far prouder than anything that may have existed in the past. 




 Even if you believe Pete Davis is not Brit Trad, Belladonna Laveau is and she is the Archpriestess and Pete is Retired. Not that it matters, but Pete is initiated into the Kent Tradition of Wicca, as well as by Raymond Buckland, as well as Gypsy Ravish. Also, our 501 (c) 3 is not the same as a regular one. Its a common misconception that even the State offices make when we are affiliating new churches. Every time they talk the new affiliate into not filing the correct paper work, because not even the clerks are familiar with it. Its a rare classification, I can understand the confusion. 

On the topic of Woolston Steen Theological Seminary: @ $39.00 a month when compared to any other college that offers Associates through Doctorate (Cherry Hill is a Masters and Doctorate program only) WSTS prices are almost free at less than $500 a year. Cherry Hill costs $95 a unit hour, which ends up being far more expensive per class, as well as being inaccessible for people without a Bachelors degree. 

 The ATC is not the same that it was 10 years ago. It's not the same as it was even a year ago. 

There is a world of bad blood that we are cleaning up from Petes time; many blockages that the community has placed in the way of the ATC because of whatever it was that Pete did/said/acted like to upset those around him. I invite you to get in line so that we can do our best to patch up any wounds that you may have from past experiences, Bella and I have been spending the last year doing just that with the other community members who have the same issues. All we are trying to do is be accessible to the community, build our local communities (both magical as well as mundane), and help empower others to be successful. 

And I would love to talk to you privately if you would wish to write me, but thought I should address your concerns in the same forum that they were raised. I don't know how the Aquarian Tabernacle Church was done before, but you might want to check us out again before you decide what we are and aren't. The times they are a changing. Blessings.

 I wonder if this would hold up in American courts? 









 This series of articles is supposed to follow the Egyptian Wheel of the Year. She told me she had not seen the content elsewhere, and wanted to make it available as the wheel turned, this year. :) 




 That may be true wherever you are from, but from the moment they stepped off the boat to escape religious persecution, Pagans have been political in America. Wicca may be 60 years old, but Americas Pagan roots are hundreds of years old. In America, if it wants to be relevant for another couple hundred years, then we need to make sure our voices are heard. 




 SMH. That's not hostility. All I've tried to do is participate in this community. I've only been here for about a week. People have voted every one of my posts up to #1 status, post after post. Dozens of people vote them up, yet the comments from 3 or 4 of the same people, over and over, seem to be disparaging, critical, or made to put a person on the defensive. I dont know what I did originally, but I'm sorry. I never meant to flare that nerve. And I'm sorry for pushing back instead of being receptive from the get go. I have not had a chance to peruse through the content here. I help run a huge church (in size, not wealth) that takes up a large portion of my time. I am working on learning the lines for a 4 day long play, in which I'm playing Herakles. Not to mention there is the Boy Child who has to be taken to school every day and picked up after band. It was never my intention NOT to contribute. I talk on Facebook all day. It was only ever my intention to contribute. I hear that it's important to add to the dialogue. My only objection has ever been that I have a natural 'push back' against being told what to do. I'm an Aries. LOL But I have a Pisces Rising, and an Aquarian Moon, so I am super sweet when I'm not cornered, and my friends are more important to me than just about anything. I want to have the people here to be part of those friends, and if we can move forward, I would love to make that happen. 




 (I am being sincere) Is a self populated rss feed the same as a multi-author website?
 




 I was on WifeSwap. If anyone has any questions about that, I would be happy to answer them. 

My personal favorite Witchcraft in the media was the episode of Charmed where they went back to Salem, and their powers didnt work. They had to use the craft of the day, because their powers didnt exist yet. So they had to do a protection spell, and so they cut an apple in half, exposing the pentacle in the center, and held a piece of Basil against it, and it made a protection spell. It was TOTALLY magically sound. Apples are immortality magic. The pentacle  in the center is the same as a pentacle in a circle which means "All four elements and spirit in perfect harmony" which makes things manifest. Basil is used to dispel negativity. So Immortality magic+Dispelling negativity+a manifestation circle(pentacle in circle)=Protection from evil. I was impressed. (both with the show, and my training. LOL) 




 The ATC is a 33 year old church, and the only one in the world with an "Umbrella Tax Exemption" which means that affiliates can get legal status through us, instead of the Fed. It is a REALLY rare classification that not even all the Christian Churches have. It is why we have as many rights, Wicca wide, as we do. The ATC and their status with the government enables ALL WICCAN CHURCHES AND PRACTITIONERS to be seen as legit. I hope that helps :) 




 I will do NOTHING to prove you wrong. "I reddit because I have things to share". Not "I reddit at your behest." I have read your past posts, and if people lived according to your weird views of life, I would be afraid of who I am, and hide my faith to protect myself from ridicule. You have suggested to new pagans to hide the symbols of their faith:

"I know, we have just as much right to wear a symbol of our faith as any other. And being out in the public helps fight the hate. If you know us, you don't hate us.
The person spewing bigoted remarks is entirely responsible for their hateful behavior. But knowing that these confrontations will occur while wearing the symbol. One has to ask one's self why they are wearing the pentacle and if they should continue.
I stopped wearing mine because I realized I had a chip on my shoulder and was begging the world to pick a fight with me. "

I think your attitude IS the chip on your shoulder. Dont blame your pentacle for people picking a fight with you. If you treat people irl the way you treat people online, I cant imagine you get much purchase with them. 

Further delving into your posting past shows that to follow you is to believe that Wicca is a club of intelligent solitaries, and megalomaniacal group leaders. 

"Covens can be a more structured environment to learn Wicca and see it in practice, but in my experience getting involved with a coven is a crap shoot. The best covens function as a group of friends, whereas ones made up of the public, or acquaintances can break down rather dramatically. Internal drama and megalomaniacal personalities are likely issues. "

I especially like where you speak for all of Wicca (which you seem to get REALLY bent about when you read what you perceive as people doing just that)

"Wicca is a highly unstructured religion."

The reason you enjoy the benefits that all the other major religions enjoy is because of the Highly Structured Churches of Wicca fighting for your rights. All you are doing is lying to new Wiccans, implanting your own psychosis and fears onto people who have come to this site looking for help, info, or support on their path, and driving away established churches/groups/people who would lend credibility to a number of the discussions that you are regurgitating on. Every page of your history has at least one comment where you are trashing someone and telling them to buy ad space for reddit. THATS spam, sir. You. You are playing the reddit police, and it seems by a few deleted OP's accounts, that you scare some of them. Bully on you. I cant believe you havent been reported yet. 

So anyone reading: I am a 3rd degree Gardenarian. My lineage is through Ed Fitch and Janet Farrar. I cant speak for anyone else but myself, and myself is a Wiccan with STRONG lineage who works every day to further Wicca. You speak for ALL OF WICCA and you tell untruths. 

You constantly rail about how you are Wiccan, but dont follow the major beliefs: "As I have so frequently said in this forum, I am Wiccan and I don't believe in magic"

Well Patricia Crowther details in "Covensense" that if you feel the need to change the BOS, then you arent Wiccan, so think on that when you're telling all these new people that they dont need to be Wiccan to be Wiccan.

So: You want dialogue? We're having dialogue. Lets start one about how you make /r/wicca a hostile environment for new people, and how that's against reddiquette. 

 




 I find it fascinating that the God forms of Spring Mysteries manifest in their priests/priestesses, in ways that go hand in hand with the archetypes. But Magic doesnt work, right? ;) 









 This sounds like professional jealousy.  We are rocking it with front page worthy content, and it seems to not be sitting well with some. Also: we don't profit off of traffic to our site. All of that content is put there for the community, not to line our pockets. I'm going to keep posting until I break a rule, (speaking of which the rule about posts/replies needing to be constructive might pertain to your post, as all it has done is trash a Wiccan news source and try to shame it into not posting on an open Wiccan forum) and thanks: maybe I'll buy some ad space to show my support. But the last thing I will do to "support reddit" is discontinue posting. Bless your heart.  




 I dont think the Gods understand "Next time" I think they are stuck in a perpetual cycle. As soon as Persephone has returned and begins making flowers, it is like she is the Kore again and has never left. Demeter would never think "I cant bear to lose her again!", because she never HAS lost her to that point.  




 I think that's an awesome idea. Maybe an amendment to the site posting rules? Also: more than 75% of my posts will be from Panegyria.com just like certain people only really post from Patheos, or any number of other pagan sites. I work at the Aquarian Tabernacle Church in the social media department. Our social media has been nonexistent for many years. I am changing that reality :) My point of posting is to share with the rest of the Wiccan community the amazing people that post through our online magazine. (to which we are always looking for spirited contributors) Though we do not have an Original Poster clause, 99% of our content cannot be found anywhere else on the net. My point of sharing it here is to give the community the best possible chance to have access to this content, and to create discussion about the topics there-in. If you would like a little write up before each one though, I am happy to do such. :)  




 It's pagan content from a Wiccan church. I didnt know I had to post a reason with it. I've been all over the site rules and the reddiquette, and nothing says there has to be statement of reason for choosing to post. I dont really have a problem posting why I am posting. I see that you are a moderator. I read over all the rules before I began posting, and have adhered to them. If anything anywhere had mentioned that we needed a reason to post something, I would have been doing it from the start. Is this just a personal thing, or is this a site wide known thing that is an "unwritten rule"? 



















 I came away with much to say after a good debate of ideas on an earlier thread. 














  The ATC doesn't represent all of Wicca. If the writer is referring to ATC, then they should make that very clear. All of these issues could have been fixed by using words that don't generalize us all. "Most Wiccans," "Some Pagans," "We at the ATC."

I can totally understand why the above remark generated inside of you. The ATC doesnt speak for all Wiccans. And since Wiccans by definition are 
(supposed to be) self responsible it can turn some folks off if they think people are trying to be their voice. When it comes to the Government the ATC is who they listen to about Wicca because it is the ATC that has been the engine behind almost every inch of ground Wicca has gained in their eyes. Even if The ATC doesnt speak for you directly, their contributions to you help you every day. 

There is just too many folks attacking us from the outside for us to bicker and play King of the Hill. We are all helping each other out. Many people have done much. The Author of this article is an ATC fan. He credits the structure of the church for making it possible for Pagans to exist in the open, in the Mid South. The Arkansas/Missouri/Tennessee area is very volatile, and have a lot of criteria for churches that only the unique structure of the Aquarian Tabernacle Church was able to meet. Also, when marched against a whole City, and  it was do or die, he sent out letters to everyone he could think of to help him. Only the ATC responded. It ended up being one of the greatest victories for Wicca that no one knows about, so is a bit of a cheerleader for them in that regard. 

It's nice to meet you, btw. I saw that you are a Super Virgo. (I looked at some of your posts) I have No Virgo anywhere in my chart, [Aries/Sun,Pisces/Rising,Aquarian/Moon] but it is nice to meet you, and I hope we can continue to have really enjoyable discourse. We dont all have to agree, but I hope we can all get along through the process :) Blessings 




 The Aquarian Tabernacle Church and Pete Pathfinder Davis have done, as far as I can tell by looking at history, far more with far less scandal than the Frosts. Veterans Tombstone Pentacle, only .edu sponsored pagan seminary, umbrella 501 (c) 3 which just by the ATC having it, it gives all of Wicca privileges that other pagan religions don't enjoy in the eyes of the government, prisoner rights for incarcerated pagans, and a myriad other accomplishments from the making it safe to be open in the Mid-South, to defending churches from all denominations (Pagan to Christian and back again) from unfair laws levied against home worship. I think few people throw Pete's name around in the circles of Pagans changing the world, because his ministry has always been behind a desk and not in front of a camera. The video of him posted earlier in the month was the first video of him I have ever seen, though I have enjoyed the benefits of his accomplishments every day I have been a Pagan. Which is every year of my life since I was 5. I think that Pete has always been an administrative Pagan. Raymond Buckland called him one of the most influential Pagans in history. His life before Paganism was one of political service. He was the mayor of Hanover, NJ. No democrat had been elected as mayor in that town for over 100 years, until he ran. He kept the job until he decided not to run again. Wicca may not seem political, but as Wiccans we are charged with keeping the balance. The People in here may or may not be correct about there being/not being a conspiracy concerning Christians and the government, but we are woefully short of Pagan politicians on either side of the isle. That's an imbalance. Pete has always told me (because I've been lucky enough to know the man) that you get more done in a tweed jacket and leather elbow patches than you can get done in a cape. He means that we need to get out there into the real world and make our lives and beliefs a parallel to the places we live in. Its no longer shocking that were Pagan. Now that we can get past meeting someone workout them freaking out about our beliefs, some of us are ready to have a say at the school board, or in city council, or on higher levels of government. 




 One must also remember that the writer of the original post is located within the Mid South in the Jonesboro, AR area. The author in question also led one of the most violently protested (by very angry Christians) marches in Wiccan History:
[ http://www.childrenofthecircle.com/videos.htm ] I am happy that the post has made people talk. I personally cant see Wicca as NOT a nature religion, since everything we do is based on the cycles of the seasons. Sabbats fall on Astrological dates (0 degrees Aries is Ostara, 15 degrees Taurus is Beltain, etc.) that coincide with harvests, livestock and planting schedules. All the creatures of the Earth are the voices, heartbeat, and children of The Lord and the Lady. In my humble opinion.  














 Hello, all! I work with The Woolston-Steen Theological Seminary (WSTS) @ WiccanSeminary.EDU We are a college offering degrees from Associates to Doctorate in Wiccan Ministries. We do not offer Degreed Elevations DIRECTLY. We have teachers from all over America, in Canada and in Australia. Teachers have the right to take on any student from the school that they find to be appropriate for training with them. So through the school, you are able to not only acquire your legal degree, but to find the teacher that is right for you. We do online course work through Second Life, which allows us to have tangible, virtual, classrooms in which you attend your courses.

In keeping with tradition as much as is possible while still keeping with the forward thinking needed to navigate an increasingly cyber world, none of our degreed elevations are done online, and must be done in person. You can attend the entirety of the College online, but to obtain your ordination through a High Priestess and High Priest, it must be done in person. This is the benefit that WSTS has in being sponsored by the ATC, which boasts a myriad churches around the country: It is increasingly easy to pair you up with someone local to you.

Our .EDU domain was entrusted to WSTS directly from the US Government to denote the validity of our school, and that anyone who was searching for a valid Wiccan seminary, would be able to do so at a glance. We are incredible reasonably priced (less than $1000 a year). We also have work scholarships for those who meet the financial requirements. I hope this helps anyone who has been looking for something like Woolston-Steen, and if you happen to need something different we wish you blessings on finding your path, and we cant wait to see you there as we walk it ourselves. Peace, Love and Light. 














 I see all the people who habitually surrender out of their games posting here, and I understand that you wouldn't want to be penalized, but the game ending and the lobby popping up before the game is over is penalization for those that dont have endless time to play. Some of us dont get to get home from school/work and just veg on smite. The people who want to play a game through to the end are already copping a punishment, so why should the people who cant make it a whole game be off scott free? If there was a penalty of some sort, people would think before casting a vote 10 minutes into a conquest match before anyone has even lost a tower. And people shouldnt be penalized for not surrendering. The point is to PLAY  the game.  




 I have been in too many conquest games where people vote to surrender as soon as it gets difficult. More than half the time no one has even lost a tower, or our team is actually ahead in position, but maybe behind in total gold and levels. What's more: more often than not we end up winning the matches that we stay in. It makes me think poorly of my teammates when the surrender is used like a reset button, willy nilly. I think the peraon who initiates the surrender, as well as everyone who votes to uphold the surrender, should incur a goodwill loss. It doesnt hurt their bottom line, its just a reminder that its unsportsmanlike to constantly leave games before youve seen them through to the end. 




 Just want to point out that through Woolston-Steen you can get a legal Associates through Doctorate degree, as well as have the opportunity to meet a dozen possible teachers that WILL take students down a 1st-3rd initiatory path. Those Degrees are not charged for. The only money charged is for the College itself (because it is a real college with a .EDU website and license from the state to award legal degrees.) Blessings, and I hope that helps! 





























 Yeah,  because I was confused,  too. Thank you for the explanation! 




 We might need to highlight this post as it gives twitter handles for people to send suggestions to with ideas on improving the Browns fan experience. This is a powerful thing that I don't think many teams have. *EDIT: spelling* 




 I think your text length was just fine. I have no problem with off field antics that dont hurt anybody. People live life and they make mistakes and people deal with pain and recreation differently. I think in the grand scheme of things we have a guy who likes to party hard when he's not succeeding at football spectacularly, and a relatively low key guy who smokes weed and blows it up on the gridiron.  I dont think either of them are being detrimental to the team, currently. I do have a bias: I live in Washington and am witnessing how benign the transition has been of legalized marijuana. One day I think this will be a highly antiquated conversation. I think it will be within the next decade that we will see major changes, and probably sooner than that. Now IM sorry for the text wall! 




 I personally think that the NFL marijuana policy is the part that is out of line, in my personal opinion. Even Goodell knows, I believe. Neither of them is doing anything that I see as detrimental to their game, or others, yet. 









 Thank you for your diligence  




 I appreciate your diligence in learning the unfortunate truth that I myself learned: He doesnt exist.

 I feel about the Steelers the way Vegita feels about Goku (Dragon Ball Z reference). He can hate him, but you dont know shit about him, so stay back. If anyone is going to dis the Steelers, its us. We have to play them 2 times every year, forever. There is a hidden honor there. We hate them the way brothers who have had a falling out hate. If anyone else trash talks them, I get offended and think "They dont have any right to trash talk the Steelers. I have a right to trash those bastards, but your Charger lovin' ass can stuff it." With that said, we have to honor our opponents that deserve honoring,  and celebrate their lives once they pass. They put up with our bickering, and they understood us better than anyone else in the league. And for that I honor a man who took his team to 4 Super Bowls. Be at peace,  Chuck. Steelers Heaven is undoubtedly welcoming you in grand style. 














 Remove the teachers and make them Mentors. Demand excellence in Math, Science, Social Studies, Sports and the Arts, but dont force a curriculum. Give the children choices and allow them to create the education they want. Make it a forum where the kids choose the direction they want thwir studies to go. Have American History, but allow the child to decide what parts they want to learn. If they dont care about the Dust Bowl, but spend 4 years learning about Ohio Railroads, the only thing that does is make them a walking resource on a subject that they are passionate about, instead of wasting 4 years teaching them a little bit about everything they dont care to remember. Don't make them read "The Wind in the Willows", make them have to read something that interests them. Be there as a guide to help them find knowledge for themselves, and ditch standardized testing. Train the Mentors in how to give a written assessment,  and then give the kids a real grade that isnt attached to a letter, but to a document that details their attitude and accomplishments and if they have learned the fundamentals to move to the next level of resources, then syart suggesting things that seem to flow with what they already seem to be doing. Every reading assignment is from a famous American author? Suggest some Tom Wolfe. The student seems to gravitate toward modern sci-fi? Suggeat some classic Asimov to round out their education. That is the difference between a Mentor and a Teacher. A Mentor helps you discover the world in which you can flourish and find things that bolster your knowledge. A Teacher stands in front of you and helps you learn a set of knowledge that is pre planned by someone who makes curriculums for a living. Also, as a parent of 3 "No Child Left Behind" age children, I would ditch it so fast. 2 of them dont read well, and the third only does because he plays video games. That program is "Leave All the Children Behind and Forget About Their Whole Generation" but that might be a little political there at the end.

 I see in the news that the balance is further exerting itself, today. All 3 running backs, now? I hate it for, y'all. 




 I was homeless for a good part of my tween and teen years. I am also from Ohio. Well, it's cold in Ohio, and being homeless doesn't confine itself to when it's warm. This makes for a lot of cold winter nights; lonely and alone. I used to talk to the Moon and Orion every night in the winter, that they were out. The problem is Orion is only out in the cold months,  and I was homeless and in need of someone to talk to all the time, so when I turned 18 I got him tattooed in dots and lines on my forearm. This way I had him with me always.  I got the idea when I saw a friend at a festival with him tattooed on his ankle. My friend is a Sagittarius,  and so his Orion is the Archer version.  Mine is the Lion and Club version.  




 Wow...the Gyro...womp. Good call. 




 As a person who loves the Browns, and as a native of Kent, Ohio (Kent State Flashes) my favorite is my flair: #16 Mr. Joshua Cribbs. A walk on, home town, Special Teams, sensation that many believe caused the new blocking rules on kick returns; forever letting it be known in Cleveland as "The Cribbs Rule" because of how it dramatically decreased his effectiveness. But this does not change how I feel about him. He would have been a shoe in for Canton if he had won a ring, and may still, but either way, Cribbs is my boy.

 Posting it to /r/Browns because its the gospel, not the votes.  









 The Ravens were created after Baltimore made a deal with the Devil. So many angry  prayers smoldered through the earth into the bowels of the Devils play place. Day and night he was assaulted with the lamentations of the lost souls, pining for their Colts. Finally the Son of Light heard a call that would end his suffering: Art Modell was weak, and was begging for release. So Lucifer, that wily old devil, whispered into the ears of each of the most powerful people in Baltimore and within the Browns, and a deal was struck! That deal included 2 SB, and safety from any lasting harm that may come against any of his players and original staff that took part in the move. In return the Browns would move to Baltimore, and in a seperate trade for his immortal soul Belichick obtained his own deal, but that will be a story for another day. And so it was that a faithful and historic football city the likes of Cleveland was stripped of their team, and Baltimores prayers were answered. But oldschool fans know in their hearts which side answered their prayers that day.  It is within each true original Baltimore Colts fan. That seed. That knowledge that it was not a godsend. It came from the other direction. And they know when he came to collect. The Super Bowl in the Super Dome. That light failure was no fluke. That was the Prince of Darkness showing up to watch the final moments of his deal. You won. And so did he. And now that Devils deal Baltimore made has come around to the other side, as all deals eventually do. I have a feeling that you will be seeing much more of this as the balance exherts itself. Safe travels, friends.

 I like Grossi 




 In 1983 my grandparents were friends with the equipment manager of the Browns. He left with the Ravens and is still their equipment manager. He had me decked out in Browns gear from the crib onward. Let the fair weather fans come out. More orange and brown for er'body! 




 I was going off of the news report that I read earlier about them telling him that CLE is a working town. It reminded me that few people get anything handed to them in NE Ohio. We make people who become presidents and astronauts because we know that hard work and dedication breed success. We want Johnny to be a success.

*edit: its not about "Making him pay for it". That was really thrown around by the media.  Its about learning. I understand lineage. Manzeil isn't just sitting on the sidelines, he's learning from Hoyer, who learned from Brady, who learned from Belichick. This is putting Johnny into that lineage and is part of what has the chance to take him from "Possible Great" to "Amazing"* 




 The media wants Manzeil to pay the Gold Price for his spot on the roster and to shine like the football savior of Cleveland. The Browns want him to pay the Iron Price and to work hard to become great, like a lump of fine metal forged into a powerfully sharp razors edge. 




 He can't get fucked because he's eating dirt while we are here to talk about him. His basic perpetual removal from Canton runnings is his well earned legacy. *EDIT Spelling* 




 Those things are the s*it

 I just found this sane and informative article by a news source so far removed from Ohio that they can only be considered "National". Lets leave some positive comments on this one. You can only read 5 of their articles in 30 days. Go Browns!

 I see where you're coming from,  and I personally think they are mosquitos,  but just because someone is into art and design doesn't automatically mean they are doctoring photos. Maybe a life long love of photography was the thing that inspired this person to go into arts and design.  Chances would be they had taken a lot of pictures in their life,  probably more than the average person. Just a question of odds says they have a better chance of capturing an anomaly due to the sheer volume of pictures taken.

 Has anyone been keeping up on his crusade on Wikipedia? He has made some pretty high level computer hacker type enemies through it. I dont know if there is a correlation. I just know that he has been attacking right wing anti-pagan Wikipedia editors who have been systematically getting pagan pages taken down, through the abuse of the rules system. It even caused one of them to get their real life persona outed, and themselves banned from Wikipedia. Planting pictures on someones computer doesnt take Anonymous level hacking skills. Did someone actually do that *shrug* I'm a bit of a conspiracy nut, so maybe/maybe not. This is just something that went through my head.  *edited for spelling*

 ###"Never Date a Writer" inspired by the works of "xstephens"

Never date a writer,    
no just never date a writer.    
It's been spoken at least once before,    
I know this;    
I'm inspired.    
If it's their ire you inquire,    
then you might just catch on fire    
In some sultry sleazy novel    
that goes screaming down the wire    
They'll start writing    
and just writing    
Diatribes that are so biting    
Of your hip size    
and your thigh size    
of that surprise between your thigh size    
Oh he's right!    
that writer writes    
about his libel barks and bites    
and as I sit here quite a quiver    
at this feeling he's delivered    
of his maddened observation    
that has taken hold his liver    
and contrived his consternation    
That has brought me such Elation!    
For it's true    
I say it's true    
as a peddler of my whimsy    
that at times a writer can be trite    
Our ego's may be flimsy    
So our hero's in our story    
tend to hint at lusted glory's    
we may wish we had the livers    
to stand proudly and deliver    
And our villains may resemble    
those that made us shake and tremble    
And so I ramble on the merits
of this Shakespearean Degenerate (that's 'day-djo-nare-it' for the non bourgeoisie)    
and you have grinned and bared it    
So there's one more thing I share:    
The street it goes two ways    
as the pen it streaks the paper    
Not always are the ones close by    
the Mobster or the Raper    
you're the ones who create the sonnets    
the inspirers of Romances    
You bring about our ecstasy    
as our paper and quill dances    
so thank you for your sacrifice    
Our art exists by you.    
You light our fuse    
You are our muse    
We love you.    
I swear we do...     




 A wonderful poem about the Mother. 









 Ive been reading your post history to find out if you are as aggressive and attacking to others as you have been to me. Turns out youre worse. You say some of the nastiest, meanest, and unhelpful things and you do it all over reddit and you do it thinking you are correct for trashing the folks you do. You trash people who think differently than you, and your posts are often just mean and belittling. "GTFO"? Why would you cuss that at someone or attack people, period? I thought that was against reddicate and against most subreddit rules. I think a long walk and maybe some medical marijuana might help you. Good luck. I know you'll most likely lash out at me, as is you M.O. or tell me that medical marijuana has no positive studies and that I'm an idiot. Thats okay. Ive gotten used to you and I now see that you cant help but be combative, and reddit is probably how you discharge all that negativity so that it doesn't effect your walking life (if you have one, because the level of negative interactions you have daily on reddit suggest you may ONLY  have this outlet to relieve yourself of the poison that your personality creates within you.) Bless your heart, it must be hard to have to force feed your opinions with a sledgehammer to those that dont think the way you do. Good luck, again, and may reddit protect its charges from the worst of your aggression. 




 A wonderful poem about the Mother. 









 I dont know if you are American or not, but I learned on a recent trip (my firs) to Canada how subliminal words can be. In Canada they have the same red circle and white line through the middle "Do Not Enter" street signs, but they do not say "Do Not Enter" on them. They just assume you know what it means, and they don't add that added line of, what I learned after not being subjected to it for 2 weeks is, aggression. I found this article to be saying the same thing: "Our wording is detrimental" I haven't said anything, and I don't believe the article said anything about any medical treatment being wrong, or inappropriate. the main point I saw was the need for a change in our verbiage, and I agree. 




 I'm not saying it isnt "profitable", it's just not "cornerable"; Which I should have been more clear on. And here are a couple links about case studies on Manuka honey and would healing.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16722850
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1742-481X.2012.01082.x/full (Though to be fair you have to subscribe to read this one)
And this more illustrated and nsfw link: http://www.medline.com/media/mkt/pdf/Therahony-study.pdf 




 I think much of the problem is you cant patent manuka honey. It just kills staph infections, and theres no way to capitalize on it monetarily. Same with reiki, chiropractics and homeopathy; iteslf around since the 1800's with 100's of positive case studies. You just cant patent and control the medicine. 
























 Yes we lost, but we lost with 24 unanswered points in the last 4 seconds to a field goal. Yes we have things to fix, but our receiving corps isnt really one of them in the way that we thought. With Tate down the Ground Pound that is West and Crowell was AMAZING amassing TD's and Yards against the vaulted LaBeau DEF like they were a collegiate team. HOYER THE DESTROYER broke bad in the second half in a serious way. This isnt a bullshit team, and it's gonna get easier from here. *EDIT: Spelling and GO BROWNS*

 




 
Yes
 




 No. That was as a flop, or being scared, or actually being payed by the Steelers on the sly.  Did you SEE how fast his head whipped around to watch the play unfold? That play has "sketchy weirdness" all over it. Either by him not really wanting to play football for a living, or by him throwing this game.  




 I cant even tell they are happening. 




 Like how people still talk about Big Ben and his sexual improprieties? Yeah. Some people just dont shutup. 




 I see you DROPPIN' his name.  




 You're a good man for trying!
 




 Thank you!
 









 I'm there with ya.

 You seem like a man who can find things. My girlfriend has agreed to a Browns Emblem on the car. I want a Chrome Brownie so bad I can taste it, but they are nowhere to be found. Can you find it, sir? Can. You? *edit:spelling*

 




 It's awesome. It's huge, hard to get a table and FULL 
OF ORANGE AND BROWN. I think I'm gonna be there....
 




 Born and Raised in Kent, Ohio. Live in Index, Washington! 




 If it makes the Yinzers waste practice reps and brain power to prepare for something that (I hope) doesn't happen, then "more's the better" *EDIT: They will be ready for it all game, and if we don't give it to 'em, then we just caused them extra stress before every play, all game*
 




 I forget that not everyone has the same way of dealing with problems by using humor, that I do. Some people are really hurt by the losses and the problems,  and I don't want to upset them.  I just travel a lot. A lot.  You have to have a good sense of humor, and thick skin, being a Browns fan on the road. And we are Shakespearian in our comedy of errors, sometimes, that I cant help but see the humor.  




 I would have voted for one of each, had there been an option. 




 Right on. I'm just trying to be goofy and bring some levity to the forum, but I am NOT trying to be disrespectful. This place rules and I love being a part of it. I can message y'all if I'm being inappropriate. *edit: SP*

 




 And yet the down votes pour in. LOL. Go Browns. *EDIT: And thank you*
 




 It's a deep level of 'funny' that we didn't fill out the score and place the lone 'W' next to the Bears. We are quick to put the losing scores in, but we subconsciously worry about claiming our victories. Probably because we all think the Browns are the only team in the NFL that could blow a 19 point lead a week after the game's over.  




 I totally stole yours this year  




 Jordan CamRon Burgundy's Mustache 




 Gratzi 




 I personally already think he would look good in that pass rush of ours,  and we already are a media storm,  so.... 









 Alignment 




 I think that after seeing another "Indians go 6-3 probably higher than most Browns scores by halftime" posts on twitter I just snapped a little this morning, and it was early. I have since learned who he is. /r/Browns is the place to learn whatever you dont know about the organization. He seriously just has never really come across my feeds. I'll have to search him out actively for a bit and check him out
 




 Nah, I don't work in sports.  




 Maybe he's just learned how to use Bleacher Report (LOL joke) 




 That is surprising as hell, to me. I live on social media. It's my job. I never see this guys name. I see Plain Dealer, ESPN, Beacon Journal all over my feeds. I never see this guy.  *EDIT: upvoting /u/brownielf for the heads up*
 




 There's always the Titans. 




 All of the sudden this chuckle head has a lot to say about the Browns. All bad. Never heard of him. He just shows up a week or so ago and is just running his mouth. Is he a newspaper reporter? Blogger? Candied Apple salesman in the Muni lot with an ignorant and public opinion? At least Mike Freeman constantly talks shit because he is actively scouting the Browns to find our faults. This guy Tom Reed comes out of nowhere like an "old hand" spraying cat shit. Blarggh. 




 I was good for 3 of those B4B pics. Nice compilation :) 




 Its also titled "Allegedly caught". I can see that SOMEONE doesnt WANT TO BELIEVE.
 




 No, this is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIwgnpTNUkQ 




 Boobs were great during the Reddit Growth Drive, and I will upvote any new submissions, but I am all about it being a seasonal thing. It is like Christmas, or Taco Tontos being closed on Sundays: It keeps things fresh and doesnt allow us to just totally run something awesome into the dirt. 

TL:DR
1: Will upvote boob pics
2: Thinks keeping Boobs 4 Browns seasonal is the way to go
3: Will upvote new boob pics
*edit: grammar* 




 Did you read the part where I said I was a Hoyer fan? You sound like the clown, yinzer. 




 I think he might actually be the Personification of Brownie. Brownies are helpers who thrive on chaotic situations, *like the story of the brownies fixing all the cobblers shoes*, and he seems to only get better when things are falling down around his head; which makes him almost TOO powerful while playing for Cleveland. 
*edit: spelling* 




 I am a Hoyerastafarian. I think he is the right QB to lead this team. With that said: How the hell is Johnny so accurate on the run, throwing across his body, with feet jumbled around like a river dancer?  









 As a Buckeye fan, this constant butt kicking we get from the Steelers makes me feel like Michigan....I am ready for the turn around! 




 Pee Wee's Big Adventure: The evil clown his bike was chained to and Large Marge. 




 O-H! 




 Browns fan for 31 years, my family are personal friends with the Equipment Manager from the pre '99 Browns (who is still the Equipment Manager for the Ratbirds) and I have been wearing orange and brown singe I was in diapers, but no: this part of life has eluded me. I feel a completeness. 
*puts on a hat shaped like a femur and eats a milkbone*
*edit: added the '99* 




 It acts the same way I do, with quiet disbelief.

 Pink tie? check. Douchy spiked hair? check. Handlebar goatee? check. Looks like everything is in order here. Welcome to the Jersey Shore. 




 He is a local,  and he is schizophrenic. He had never talked to me before (I'm new in town) and today he came up to me and told me about "Sound and Light Terror Grids" he says they are compressing light and sound within these grids, and that it is an attempt to make us blind and deaf. He says that only special breathing patterns,  and REALLY clean water can help prevent it. He also told me they have been working these things on us since we were little. I don't discount crazy. I do however run it by reddit. 




 Its true. My exploits on reddit often take me to making fun of Ravens fans, which is a celebrated pastime in Cleveland. Since it doesn't get me just over flowing buckets of upvotes, (as you can see on both your post and this one) maybe I'm just doing it because I enjoy sharing, and not because I am garnering some kind of up vote support. I get my life fulfillment from traveling, my job as a minister, and having sex with my wife. This is what I do for fun, not validation. So drop the down vote. Ravens suck. Lol. 
*edit spelling* 




 This is not Rallying the troops. This is sharing. Rallying would be if I was asking you to do, anything. Sorry if I offended your reddit sensibilities, /u/chuckyjc05 I'm really just sharing exploits of a Browns fan on reddit with the subreddit for the Browns. 




 I made a comment on the fact that the Ravens are in 32nd place for Reddit growth. I just wanted to share the exchange. Heres the link: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/2ei4v1/subreddit_growth_results_after_the_third/cjztgvu 




 I made a Raven boohoo on this thread because I said "LOL Ravens suck" his only response was "Says the guy with no flair" leave it to the Ravens to bitch about flair usage. 




 I'm also impressed that 4 people other than you don't hate Baltimore. That's a negative Karma score that truly, truly impresses me. 

*EDIT: Since the posting of this, people have upvoted my original from -4 to 0* 




 No. Thats why I hate it.
 




 I'm a Browns fan. Cant wait to see your throwback jerseys, son. 




 The one that really grinds my gears is when I hear a Steeler say "Here we go Steelers Here We Go!"
 




 Lol. Ravens suck.  




 Well, now it's roached.  




 THE MADNESS!!!!!! http://www.thedrawplay.com/comic/sadness-week-the-time-traveler-part-2/

 You'd have thought they would have hashed this out, by now.
 




 Does a DUI count toward substance abuse? It's a substance based breaking of a law, but it wasnt him failing a drug related NFL rule. I'm still confused on that. 




 I'm sure your statement will weed out those that try to seed this thread.
 









 Yeah, he was sitting on top of 70 passed drug tests and a lawsuit. 




 I never had Gessford, though he retired my Senior Year. I had Atkins.

 At the end of the day we're all AFC North.  









 "Conner Shaw-nuff you right he had a 151 passer rating" I'm still working on it.
 




 I agree with you. I also have been a big fan of him as a pickup since the Draft. My prediction was that Hoyer would get bumped out for Manzeil, then around game 8 I see him getting creamed on a scramble, and then they bring in Shaw and he lights it up not only that game, but for the rest of the,  year. He starts in Johnny comes back at the beginning of '15, plays 2 games, they bring Shaw back, he takes us to the Super Bowl. 
 




 
That's fair: Now I downloaded it to my computer and it froze my whole system up after the 2 hour download and made a weird little window that wouldn't go away, or even let me open my Task Manager, sooooooo now it's confirmed on my box to be a bunch of crap, and a large site doesn't denote a safe site. Gratzi.
 




 I don't know about on your computer,  but on the mobile it takes you to what looks like a phishing page.  Went to real Google Play and downloaded the actual app it asks you to get? Yeah,  doesn't work to open the game up. It still takes to to the same "Download this app to proceed" page.  If you have better luck on your desktop/laptop,  let me know.  




 As a matter of fact, there is even a bar on the SIM. If its connected to the Browns Reddit, we might even be able to get players to make avatars and come talk. They do that with musicians all the time. Trent Reznor will come on play a live show and have his computer set up in the room and it live relays his performance. We could use FRAPS and record the interviews and throw it onto youtube and feature it here. It would be cool to have the first Second Life Browns Backers group. *spelling* 




 So,  Second Life is considered its own country. It has its own currency that is traded on the stock exchange (The Linden Dollar '$L') and it's public, free, and online. Not only that, but I have access to an entire parcel of land that would be all about us meeting there. Just a thought  




  the NFL is a SFW hobby

Yeah.  What with all those role models getting shot, beating their significant others unconscious, battling drug addiction, and murdering folks. 

 




 The OP shames herself by posting naked pictures on an open forum,  and it's not my intention to shame her regardless.  

Uhhhh, That's shaming. You just said she is a shame unto herself,  and then you said it wasn't your intention to shame.  For shame. I'm a left wing hippy (gun toting). I am disappointed.

 The ladies from church wanted to help out. :) 














 Let me see what I can do. 




 Well, she IS a Steelers fan...and are you saying he was acting like a "LaBeau"? Huh? Huh? Amiright?  




 Im also wearing an all orange shirt today, and she had on her Steelers jacket. 




 I walked into the bank today, I live in Seattle, and there is this blonde girl that works behind the counter who is a Steelers fan. The very first time that I saw her I joked "Aren't you say Seattlite? Why the Steelers gear?" She looked at me and said 

"I don't give a f*** I like the Steelers they are a good team they win I don't care about the Seahawks I mean I'm a fan I guess but I'm a Steelers fan first."

 After that she wouldn't look at me or wait on me at all so I just went in there today and had to put in a deposit and she was the only one there. I walked up and I said "I'm sorry I give you crap about being a Steelers fan." And she said

 "I don't give a s*** you're just mad cuz we have six and you have one!"

 To which I realized she thought i was a Seahawk fan, so I replied "I'm a Browns fan." Her demeanor instantly changed; a big smile crossed her face and she said 

"oh, well you got 0." 

And I said "yep we've got 0 but I guess we can at least hate the Ravens together"

 and she said "f*** the Ravens" 

and I said "f*** the Ravens" 

and she said "and the Browns" 

I said "hey f*** the Steelers" 

and we both laughed and we said "f*** Cincinnati" 

and then now we're friends and she smiled as I walked out the door. And that is what it means to have the best rivalry in all of the NFL. And I got to cuss in the bank.

 Professional hubris. They want more money than the distributors think they are entitled to, to be distributed.  They lean on the age of their brewery to get treated differently.  When it first made it to GA, I worked at a bar. This is what the distributor told me.

 My teams name is "Jordon CamRon Burgundy's Mustache" I even made a picture last year: https://twitter.com/TheJackalope/status/385529932228476928 




 There is a bus that had a water gun attached to it,  and they soak the new people and they walk by. My grandfather was like: "Stop. Look at the water. Where do you think it came from?" I looked at the bus and it sprayed this huge stream out.  It was awesome. 




 It would be wrong of me to give it away. You should make the pilgrimage sometime!
 




 So you've decided to be a Browns fan? Well, there's a couple things that you need to know to successfully navigate wearing the Orange and Brown. 
 
Number 1: "Don't worry, there's always next year." Now I know what you're thinking: "Why would he be saying there's always next year? We haven't even started this year." This is part of the sacred Tao that is being a Browns fan. It is a mantra that many of us have prayed over, because we know, possibly more than anyone,  that there is no such thing as a sure thing.

Number 2: "We are the hipsters of football fans" I said it. We as Browns fans only support teams that won championships before the institution of the Sellout Bowl. I mean Superbowl. *dons orange and brown flannel shirt, horn rimmed glasses and knit cap*

Number 3: That being said learn who Paul Brown, Jim Brown, Lou Grouza and Otto Graham are.

Number 4: If you're one of the new fans who is going to have the pleasure/privilege/luck of attending home games at FirstEnergy Stadium, be ready to be part of a stadium where you cant have glass bottles! That's right Browns fans like to throw bottles onto the field and the stadium banned their use after one such incident. We are rowdy.  Its fun. 

Number 5: You also can't bring in items from outside, into the stadium. After we could not throw bottles somebody decided to throw batteries.

Number 6: If you get to tailgate before the game in the Muni lot, and you see a large bus. with the ground completely saturated with water in front of it, just keep walking forward and don't contemplate the situation.
 
Number 7: Cornholing is no longer just a sexual slur.

Number 8: F*** the Steelers. (Like for real. We dont like those guys. Ravens[ratbirds] either)

Number 9: Its a Brownie, not an Elf

Number 10: All contributions to televised football aside, we know that Art Modell is actually a multi time failed business man who is the only person to ever bankrupt a football team. 

Number 11: The plain orange helmet is sacred. 

Number 12: Next Year Is Coming. 

I'm sure others may have more to add below, but this is a gift from me, 31 year Browns fan, to you as a bright eyed new dawg ready to get a bark or two out in the pound this year. Welcome. 




 Ummmmm,  no. Aquarian Tabernacle Church marketing guy, yes. (You can check us out @ www.aquatabch.org and our legally recognized seminary at www.WiccanSeminary.EDU The ATC, serving Wiccan needs in 7 speaking nations.) And I hate BP so much I do my best not to use aluminum, because BP controls Lions shares of the aluminum produced in the world. I'm appalled at what they did. My spirituality is one of deep connectedness to the living organism that is our "planet". That being said: I want other opinions so I don't stagnate. And this ish is bugging me,  so I asked y'all. *edited for spelling because my phone is a champ* 




 I had heard that BP was looking to recoup some of what they had to pay out because they believe they over payed. I was wondering what you all thought?
