 I found lots of startup-related services being offered on Fiverr. Those look entire untrustworthy to me (in fact, everything offered on the site looks quite untrustworthy). But since Fiverr has such high traffics, they must be good for something I guess. Anyone (especially startup founders) has experience working people there? 




 No, I am not the author, but you can contact him here http://toddwschneider.com/about/ 









 I didn't create this, saw the image somewhere else and decided to post it here. But you are right, this is misleading sometimes. 









 At the moment yeah, open open to two countries because opening up to more countries requires some additional development work (e.g. converting exchange rates and so on). There is one way to work around it though, sign up as US or Canada, and then go to your profile page and make the change. Sorry for the inconvenience. 




 No problem! Thanks for suggesting the question too! 




 If you go to the Entertainment section, you will see your question (which currently has 1 response). You will have to wait for a while before you can see results (because others have to complete it first). 




 Sorry about this! What is the question you asked? 









 Thanks for the feedback! 




 Thanks for the links! 




 Thanks for the feedback! 




 Tried, but never got them to feature us, they simply receive tooooo many submissions everyday. 




 Thank you! Very help indeed. 




 Thanks! Any idea where you may find these people and what do offer them usually? 




 If you browse as a guest, your default location is Canada (because we don't know where you are and also don't want to save your IP and figure out your location that way). We have to pick a location for you so yeah, we picked where we are. 




 I've been working on a site called Arima (http://arima.io) with a team for a few months now. We have built a pretty decent product (I think) and we are just in the initial stage of gaining traction (public released in 10 days ago). We get about 30 or so users a day.

Let me begin by describing what our startup does. We are a Q A site for mass opinion. Basically, unlike most Q A sites, where responders can freely enter text (which becomes difficult to browse once you get a lot of answers), we focus on multiple choice and numerical responses, and help you tally up answers so that it is easy to see what the mass think. We also try to get you some in-depth analysis of data, such as what people from you country/city selected or answered, their demographics information and so on. In short, think of us as Quora for Mass Opinion.

Like every consumer internet startup, we are a site requires a lot of visitors and a lot of content. For the moment, I don't know what is a good way to get initial traction. Here are some thoughts:

1) paid advertising (most obvious) - tried reddit, facebook and stumbleupon. Nothing too great at the moment.
2) Reddit - reddit has a huge userbase with a lot of users interested in this kind of stuff. I tried posting in /r/internetisbeautiful, for example, and got some traction from there. But once your post drop down to the second page you lose attention, and I am not sure how else I can utilize reddit.
3) I have a blog http://insights.arima.io where I write some articles, but again, haven't found a good way to push this out.

Please let me know what you think, and if you know any good ways to get traction, please let me know! Thanks! 









 thanks! map is on our backlog. 




 Thanks:), yeah we will try to open up to everyone as soon as we can. 




 Thanks for the tips!

We've recently added a guest login feature, now you can go in and start seeing content without actually having to register. 









 All the ads are charged in US dollars right? So if I am from Canada, and want to advertise on this platform, is credit card the only way to pay (in which case the bank would charge me an additional fee for process US payments). Are there any other ways to pay for ads (e.g. paypal)? Thanks.

 I think a 3 people team is totally fine (if you   this Google guy are the only people on board now). 




 Is he the technical person or the business person on your team?

I suggest that you should consider some alternatives. Your partner will likely spend a lot of his time with his new internship (at least for the first few month), which means that he will have less time to focus on your project. While it is true that an internship at Google makes you look good on paper, this does not solve your current problems (i.e. build a product). His experience at Google will help you in the long run, but this does not mean anything right now. I suggest that you should consider finding another partner (perhaps keep this guy as well, but on a part time basis with less equity). 




 Which city are you from may I know?

I suggestion is to find a technical co-founder. You can find this person thru 1) your college/university, 2) local meetup groups, 3) angelist or 4) linkedin. Find people who like to work for startups (even on a part time basis) and start from here. 




 If people want recipes, why not just google and find some online? 




 The home page took a really long time to load, is that just me? 




 Can you do some consulting work in the meantime? 
http://paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html read the section on consulting. 




 Honestly, I did not find the video. I knew you said there is a video, but I did not find it until the second time visiting. I was expecting more like a youtube/vimeo type video.

Still, I think having pictures is a good thing. Few people would actually watch the video because it take a long time to do so.  




 I suggest that you put fewer words on the homepage and more visuals. I don't think I would bother reading all of the texts. 




 I know engine oil changes are generally every 3-5 months or 3,000-5,000 miles, but how do you know I have driven 3k-5k miles? Do I self report that?

I think this is an interesting business idea. Personally I would not use it because I don't have access to a car now, but I think some will find it helpful. I am pretty sure that there are similar services (especially apps) out there about it, have you researched? 




 A few things

- I think you should purchase your own domain, and get a serious hosting service (not one that puts ads on your site). These things are cheap nowadays and they really make your site professional.

- I don't like sites with black background, this could be a personal thing.

- I think you should have somethings that explain what you do (other than saying you track maintenance), e.g. a video or a faq page or some visuals. It is hard to get people to sign up for something without know what it is. For example, I'd like to know (before I sign up) how you track my much I drive and when my next maintenance date is (I think that depends on time as well as how far you drove right?). Do I submit my mileage, do you estimate it based on my driving habits, or do you track with an app? 




 You should post it here if you don't mind giving it away. 




 you can try some ads via Facebook or Google targeting those interested in affiliate marketing. Or try to talk to some other sites (hopefully in the same area) and see if you guys can exchange links. 




 Here are my suggestions,

1) Do NOT start with writing a business plan (especially if your idea is around the internet). Not saying that they are useless (which I believe so), but your time could be used elsewhere.

2) If you have little cash, you better have someone who can code. This can be either through finding a CTO (your classmates, friends, people you find on LinkedIn, Angelist etc), or learn to code yourself (e.g. Codecademy). In these days, it's very hard to raise money from investors with just ideas. 

3) Start with building an MVP. Find a decent designer (this you will have to pay for, because you can learn coding but design you cannot learn quickly) and make your site look pretty, visual is important.

3) Go and talk to people with your MVP (once you have it done) and see what they say. Have them sign up for a beta or collect user interest. You may be able to get some investment with an MVP, and then that's when you can start hiring developers. 




 maybe add a new feature called browse as a guest. Users can see limited things (e.g. the first 50 events only, or can see events but not the details). That way those 17% will be able to learn about the app before giving away their info. 




 I think that you should begin with testing your product among your friends and family first. Ask them if they would pay for your product or no, and if not why not. Sometimes people don't use your product because it is bad (in which case you know you need to go to work again); sometimes they don't use it because there are similar services out there which are free (in which case you can think about a free version, and then later add more features and make it premium account, like LinkedIn); and sometimes they don't use it because they don't realize its value (e.g. if you are a new product that does not exist), in this case you can consider giving a 14 days or 30 days trial. But in all cases, you should keep in mind that if you plan to charge money, don't offer it complete for free now because most people will not pay for something that was free. 




 Very helpful articles. Thanks! 




 I think you should capitalize the "i"'s . This makes yourself a much more professional person and encourages others to go on and read your blog.... 




 Putting a video on your site (say you working in your studio/office) would be nice I think. Hearing and seeing someone talking videos make them more trustworthy. 




 I have some functions of x, in the form of d* sqrt(x) or d* log(x) where d is known. I would like to rewrite (approximate is fine) them in the form a/(1 + bx^c ), where a b and c are arbitrary.

I think one way to do this is to write out the Taylor series expansion on both sides, and then try to match coefficients. Are there better ways to approach this problem? Thanks! 




 Just my suggestion here:

Math/Probability foundations:
-Real Mathematical Analysis by Charles Pugh
-Probability: Theory and Examples by Rich Durrett
-Something on Stochastic processes would be helpful, e.g. Probability and Random Processes by Geoffrey R. Grimmett and David R. Stirzaker
-If you want to do cryptography, something in abstract algebra would be helpful, consider Algebra by Serge Lang.

For Statistics, 
You could try Theory of Statistics by Mark Schervish (a good grad book for Bayesian analysis), alternatively, you can try the classic book Theory of Point Estimation and Testing Statistical Hypotheses by Erich Lehmann.

If you're interested in machine learning, read Chris Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning or Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin Murphy.

I am not familiar with other parts of CS other than machine learning so that's my suggestion. 




 Including both job title and age should be okay, buy you need to make sure that the two aren't highly correlated (usually the older you are, the higher job title you have, and this is more common in some industries than others). Could try using levels 1-5, say, to code jobs, where 1 is no experience required, 2 is 1-5 yrs of exp, 3 is 5-10, 4 is 10-20 and 5 is 20+. Or can also try 1 = ordinary titles (like analysts, coordinators, etc). 2 = senior (e.g. senior analysts), 3 = manager, 4 = director and 5 = VP level or higher. This more or less corresponds to the yrs of exp. 




 I think you should first start by quantifying job titles. There are many job titles out there (which will be hard for you to fit in a model), and even the same job title can have very different salaries (e.g. a manager at a small company vs. a manager at Goldman Sachs). Perhaps years of experience is a better measure? 




 recall that (x-y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2, use this to find x and y. 




 Machine learning is something you should definitely learn, regardless of which branch of stats you do. I suggest try to take on a few consulting projects while you are in school (even for free) and start building a profile (much like a programmer or a designer). You can try to find projects through your university - most university offer consulting services - or professors, who typically have industry connections. Another thing you can try is through LinkedIn or through Meetup. Once you get to work on a few real projects, you will be able to learn how to communicate with non-stats/business people and really understand what the industry is doing. Then ask them for references and slowly move yourself to the fields you are interested in by taking projects from those areas. 




 graduate stats major is pretty promising these days, you can do business analytics, biostats, go work for a bank or even startups. My advice is try to take some (in fact many would be even better) computer courses while in university and learn coding before you go find a job. 




 amazing goal 
























 Perhaps you could talk to the statistics department of your university? Sometimes they have courses/services where undergrads or masters students get pair up with students from other disciplines and help them with statistics. 




 NO WAYYYYYY! 




 Really? I am gunna guess more people say Jorah Mormont. 




 There are many good courses on Coursera so I suggest start from there. I won't give you any specific recommendations because there are too many courses available and it's just best if you look at some of those and decide which ones fit your needs. 




 I know you can get the p-values using an R package called pvclust, and this is adequate for my purpose. I'd like to know if we can go a step further, and, for example, get numbers like variable x contributes the most to which cluster an observation belongs to (e.g. 25%), and variable y follows, etc.

 usually, when people ask me to sign NDAs, I would ask "if I signed this piece of paper, and really broke it, do you have the time/effort/money to actually sue me?" 



















 no idea, just found the picture, and thought it's a nice shirt. 









 perhaps there is some secret agreement where if he resigns he will be okay. 
























 Honestly, I would put business registration last. Start with designing your website (which I assume you will need one, and will be attracting most of your customers online), and then give the idea a go. You can probably get a business number (say as a partnership first) and start operating your business. If you get a lot of users, then move on to registering. Don't wait time on incorporating/insurance/lawyers unless if you are planning to raise money. 









 Wouldn't it be annoying if it was a slack group with like hundreds of people?  
























 I would consult a lawyer or the government. 














 why isn't Canada a part of this? 



















 1. Building Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) is easy. Knowing which assumptions to validate is not.

2. Nailing an MVP fast involves a certain degree of luck. It takes time to find the right distribution channels.

3. Learning to code is not essential, but its important and helpful when you cant hire/find technical talent.

4. Entrepreneurship is learning to live in a constant state of uncertainty. Yes, endless doubts every single day.

5. A great MVP is finding people like yourself and build/ join a community around that interest.

6. The success of a product can be highly dependent on its design at the first stages of a startup.

7. Great design comes with great understanding of a problem. How it works not how it looks Jobss motto, is what matters.

8. Arrogance kills you and your relationships. Then your startup dies.

9. Learning curves are underestimated. A lot of time in startups goes into learning how to do new things you ignored and cant hire people to do.

10. Motivation is hard. Keeping your team motivated comes from you being motivated. Startups dont run on cash only but on morale too.

11. Startups are creative organizations that might turn into businesses one day. Many startup investors think they invest in the latter.

12. Build something for yourself is dangerous advice, you risk building something only you want. It is fun though.

13. Finding liquidity in startups is hard. Its almost unethical to take money from friends, fools and family without product market fit.

14. San Francisco can be the cheapest city on earth for a startup founder. The benefit-cost ratio when meeting the right people is extremely high.

15. Rejection, not failure, is the default state of startups (from market, family and investors). Its not personal, do not mix emotions with business.

16. Building a company is not the same as managing a company. In the beginning, the most important thing is managing yourself.

17. Leadership is a daily decision. Doing what you say, setting the example and inspiring others is what matters.

18. Mixing hobbies and passion with work can backfire. Money pressure can take the beauty out of anything. Mastering the balance is an art.

19. There are no startup experts. Every startup is related to the uniqueness of their founders. Be wary of startup experts.

20. The best startup pieces of advice Ive found are stories from other founders. Taking the best out of them and learning is a continuous challenge.

21. Starting a startup is a gamble. The more educated the gamble the better. Its important to know the history of your industry.

22. Networking is most effective when you can bring value to the network. Most people just want to extract value.

23. Focus on your strengths is a luxury for startups. Its the biggest excuse not to do something youre startup needs because you ignore how to do it.

24. Venture capital is helpful but can be addictive. Its hurtful when you dont have it and think you need it.

25. Being delusional kills startups. Most founders are delusional. Meditation helps.

26. Capital does not precede success, it works the other way around.

27. Try not to spend a week without talking or listening to people who are successful at what they do.

28. Almost every design fault or bug can be fixed with great customer service.

29. If you want to become something hang out with people who are already that something.

30. If you want an audience be part of the audience first.

 I think this will prevent a lot of people from using, or trying, your service. I don't have amazon, and I probably won't get one just for your site. I suggest maybe add Paypal/other payment methods, or at least make the trial one available for non-amazon users. 




 I am on the create test page, and my question is, do I have to log in with Amazon to proceed? What if I just want to claim the free trial/don't have Amazon? 














 It's Like Facebook For Canadians.

Not sure why Canadians need one? 




 I briefly looked at it, and I don't think it's too clear (at least to me) what the site is doing. Is it some sort of tool to help people connect (like meetup type)? 









 Don't need help right now, but it's very kind of you.

23. "The critical ingredient is getting off your butt and doing something. It's as simple as that. A lot of people have ideas, but there are few who decide to do something about them now.

42. "The very first company I started failed with a great bang. The second one failed a little bit less, but still failed. The third one, you know, proper failed, but it was kind of OK.

That's the beauty of living in a free country and having the freedom to have an idea and become an entrepreneur." --Harold Hamm, CEO of Continental Resources

44. "It's hard to tell with these internet startups if they're really interested in building companies or if they're just interested in the money. I can tell you, though: If they don't really want to build a company, they won't luck into it. That's because it's so hard that if you don't have a passion, you'll give up." --Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple

45. "I love what the Valley does. I love company building. I love startups. I love technology companies. I love new technology. I love this process of invention.

47. "Libraries function as crucial technology hubs, not merely for free Web access, but for those who need computer training and assistance. Library business centers help support entrepreneurship and retraining." --Scott Turow, author and lawyer

48. "President Obama's view of a free economy is to send your money to his friends. My vision for a free enterprise economy is to return entrepreneurship and genius and creativity to the American people!" --Mitt Romney, politician

50. "The great fear that hung over the business community in the 1970s was death by regulation, and the great goal of the conservative movement, as it rose to triumph in the 1980s, was to remove that threat--to keep OSHA, the EPA, and the FTC from choking off entrepreneurship with their infernal meddling in the marketplace." --Thomas Frank, political analyst

 Thanks for the clarification!

Can you should me when it was posted? I looked under new and didn't find it (I could be blind).

Also, how should I know if something has been posted before? I remember that when I submit links that has been posted already, it will take me to that link. Did this feature get disabled? 




 Hi,

I didn't quite understand the rule. Did I repost something that someone else posted 2 weeks ago?

Thanks 














 I use Firefox; I think the issue I am having is all the cap letter   the background colour that makes it difficult for the eye. 




 I think you should adjust the font, the homepage banner (with all the capital letters) are really hard to read for me. 




 At my age (Im 38), Im not claiming to know everything (or to be an expert in anything for that matter), but I do believe Ive learned a few things. As I approach my 40s, I thought Id share the lessons (sometimes hard) that Ive learnedand earned:

1. Nobody cares about what you say, only what you do.
2. Funding is not the end, only the beginning.
3. Once you take on funding, the stress gets worse, not better.
4. Dont beg for investment dollars. Theyre paying to be your partner, not the other way around.
5. Arrogant and disrespectful investors will never be good partners. Ignore them.
6. Never, ever, ever, pay to pitch.
7. TechCrunch is overrated. Unless you sell to startups, it doesnt do shit. Its good for the ego though.
8. Some people only care about people who they think are popular. Theyll only acknowledge you when you appear to be more connected then they are. Get rid of these people.
9. Some people only like you for what you can do for them. Pay them no mind.
10. Accelerators are only good for funding and meeting new friends. Is that what 6-8% equity is worth to you?
11. Take a job if you have to. You will not lose your will to be an entrepreneur for doing so.
12. Take huge risks in your 20s. Take calculated risks in your 30s.
13. If you have an idea that keeps you up at night, do something with it. If not, it will always only be a dream.
14. Its okay to be driven by money at first. Once you have it, youll find your true motivation.
15. Non-techies: If your tech cofounder says its going to take three months or more, theyre lying.
16. If your tech cofounder says they cant use existing code, cut ties immediately.
17. If your non-tech founder says they cant sell X until you build Y, theyre making excuses for not working.
18. Sales are everything. Nothing else matter. Nothing.
19. Learn something new every day. One thing at least.
20. Even if you dont publish it.
21. Marketing isnt luck, its hustle.
22. Press isnt magic, its hustle.
23. Always partner up, never partner down.
24. Do something uncomfortable as often as you can.
25. Failing is part of growing. Very little of what you do is actually going to work, embrace it.
26. .coms are still the best domain you can get. Its probably worth the price.
27. Things are never as bad as you imagine them to be.
28. It doesnt matter where your startup resides. Its only you that care.
29. Tech conferences are a waste of time, but fun.

 So then how does that help me get more press coverage? Why can't I just find a list of contacts (assuming that you are not the only place to find the 1400 journalists), and reach out to some of them? 




 This is completely not true. Amazon is a counterexample. I am sure there are plenty out there. 




 Aren't there a lot of tools already that you can filter/track certain keywords on twitter? How are you different? 




 you spelled sign in with twitter as sing in with twitter (blue button in the footer) 




 I see the concept, but not really sure why I should order from you instead of a local supermarket. Perhaps add some points about why you're special. 




 If you are worried that your idea gets taken, try to exchange some emails with him/her so that you have a written record of your idea, or keep a voice recording of your initial conversation (not sure if that's legal). 




 I would suggest get some traction first before you think about reaching out to any investors. 



























































 I think it depends a lot on the location and what type of statistics you do (e.g. biostats, machine learning, big firms, startups, etc). One of my MS friends started with 55k (Toronto) working as a SAS programmer for a small HR firm, and I've also hear cases where they start with 80k with just 6 months experience. 




 Yeah, this I figured out as well, didn't quite understand why people would use it. 









 Some honest opinions.

1) Why is your team so big? Why do you need 6 people and what do each of them do?

2) Traction to date?

3) Slides 5   6 - I would avoid using the pictures you are using, they make the deck look unprofessional.

4) Why do you want to raise 125k? How do you plan to use that money? 




 I don't quite understand what the site is doing, tbh. 














 I think there are a lot of similar services already, so it would have to be substantially different for most people to start using, IMHO. 
























 I heard nothing. I am just hoping, nothing more. 




 Metroid is a good series, definitely something to hope for. 




 personally, I'd like to see The Elder Scrolls VI. 







































 What's the point of this? Why not just use angelist of some other legit websites? 



















 What's the Shoshone exploit? 




 I see what you are saying, but if you play lower levels, you could lose get a free worker if you declare war early, just not that early. 




 Higher level usually means you'd need to fight for room, not building your own settlers. 




 couldn't agree less. 




 definitely infantry. 




 Keep on hearing people say deity is so easy, blah blah blah, so I'm really curious how good people really are. Personally, I've never defeated Immortal or Deity. 









 MORATAAAAAAAAAA!!! 














 I didn't meant to say it was my own. Just found it funny and post it here. 



















 Studies in the past have suggested that 1) companies with shorter names tend to do well, 2) companies that start with the letter A tend to do well, and 3) companies with infrequently used letters like Q, X, Z tend to do poorly.  





























 yeah, that seems like what most people want. 









 fair request. 




 What do you consider as sweet stuff? 




 That makes sense. Game prices are high nowdays.
Would you do it for in game ad ons? 














 Was reading this article http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2015/06/03/fallout-4-looks-great-but-you-still-shouldnt-pre-order/

and wanted to know if people would or wouldn't pre-order 



















 One thing I found helpful to some students was just copy the proofs (word for word) many times in your notebook. A lot of times things become more intuitive and obvious after you repeat it many times.
