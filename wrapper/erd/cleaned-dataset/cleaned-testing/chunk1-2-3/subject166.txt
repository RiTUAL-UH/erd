If not, do you really want to privatize it which means turning it over to Wall Street and having fees charged every quarter for managing "your money"?    I don't understand you as much as I try. 




















































































  http://www.netrootsnation.org/  I went 4 years ago and had a great time.   


































 This interview made me very anxious.  The interviewer sounds very reasonable.  How did Simpson get appointed to this committee?  And wouldn't it be great to have an intelligent interview with a committee member? 














 I'm a liberal, but this is getting too much for me.  Is it time that we "ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country." 

















































 My laptop picked up some virus on reddit last November.  There was a post on it at the time, but it was already too late.  If I remember right, it was not in windows or directly in reddit.  Now, I have to unplug my computer and remove the battery almost every time (not always, but most times) I boot up.  Does anyboy remember this and know how I can fix it.  I would appreciate any advice on this. 




















































































































































































































































 I told them I was a Democrat voting for Obama, but I am still getting thier robo calls! 




 The original was one of National Geographic's most memorable photos. 




 I posted the Guide as it can be helpful, particularly in nonpartisan judges races when you don't know who they are. 









 http://nevadavoterguide.com/
This is the progressive guide. 




 I guess when Republicans were crying about voter fraud, they were talking about  their own members.  I haven't heard or read of one incident by Democrats, but have read about destroying ballots in mulitple states. 




 How about government which doesn't create jobs, but Romney will create 12 million jobs as President? 




 I saw my niece's photo yesterday volunteering in a Romney campaign hdqtrs.  She had two children under medicaid, although she is now married to the father. 




 Harry Reid is a Democrat and a Mormon.  I know other Mormon Democrats. 




 Want to come to my house?  My pool needs replastering and repair! 




 Romney is Bush on steroids. 




 I'm watching CNN now stating Romney won.  Drives me crazzzzzyyyy. 




 I have a friend who is a CPA AND is an Oracle programmer.  Travels everywhere she wants. 




 That I could have done better. 




 I love you Paul Krugman. 




 Wow.  A lot of comments!  A co-worker and I discussed it.  We would offer $1 million to each co-worker who would walk away with us that day. 




 1890 or 1990? 




 I like that. 




 They also didn't want the economy at that time. 




 Yes, it is one more form of corporate welfare.  People need a living wage. 




 Wow.  I appreciate you summarizing it like this. 




 I been doing that for 40 yrs.  Getting too tired.  Just hope others can take over in greater numbers. 




 I agree, and their sleasiness. 




 I haven't read the article, but there is still too much talk about the grand deal.  We need to change the premise first. 




 Who would have thought Bush would win a second term?  Yes, these guys will stop at nothing.  Did you read the article about Bain owning the company that supplies a lot of the voting machines? 




 The existing super rich will end up with it ALL. 




 JFK, RK and MLK assassinations, and who was behind the plot to overthrow FDR. 




 You are so right.  Now, how do we convince others? 




 This is common.  The Post Office is a good example.  Congress voted them to keep 70 years (or 80, I don't remember the details) in retirement funds, which meant they would not have enough money to operate today.  Then they blame the PO mgmt for not being able to meet today's expenses. 




 Didn't the last guy who was going to testify about the 2004 presidential race in Ohio die? 









 And I can't even get some of my closest friends or family to see. 









 i am so tired of them, and their baby-like tantrums. 









 I used to play Diplomacy, but you need 6-8 people to play and it can be a long game. 




 Awesome view.  You can see five mountains lined up out the window.  I got a photo too, but was on a clear day with blue skies. 




 It is my biggest scare.  I don't have a choice though - Romney who promises cuts to SS, and Obama who has shown indication to deal with the republicans on this issue.  The last time there was a ss compromise was a disaster for some of us.  I'm looking at my future ss cut of $400 due to the last agreement.  What will they do this time? 




 Doesn't matter.  There are still enough people to vote for him no matter what he says or what his policies are. 






























































































































































































































































 I see these ads that you can build your own panels from factory seconds.  Has anyone done this, and does it work? 




























































































































































































































































































 It's a fun day trip to continue on from the date farm to Tecopa, Shoshone and then Death Valley. 




 A swimming pool.  I've had it empty for the last 6 years now because it costs too much to have it refinished,  and I'm concerned about the extra water and utility use with global warming.   




 I know.  I've been waiting my whole life. 
























 Years ago, we had a welfare march in my town to protest some of the policy decisions from our state that cut many people off the rolls.  There was also an anti-welfare march to support those policy decisions.  I later met the leader of the anti-welfare march.  He had had a heart attack, his wife left him, and he lost his house.  He was trying to get legal assistance when I met him.  It could happen to any of us.  Oh, and by the way, I just wish I would hear as much complaining about corporate welfare which probably surpasses all of the welfare programs - and generally ends up in just a few pockets. 




 You are right.  I meant cheaper to make. 




 If men and women make up that 60%, half would be 30%. 




 I love this! 




 I hurt for the younger generations, but I'm not sure that is the answer.  I want those programs there for them also. 




 Of course, I know what percent of taxes people pay.  Did you know that the top rate use to be 90%?  Money has been devalued on purpose!  I saw the head of the manufacturer's lobby on c-span during the Bush administration saying that was their goal.  They want goods to be cheap enough for Americans to afford them.  They also want to pay less for wages.  The bottom 45% pay a higher percentage of their wages in payroll taxes.  I think the low-income tax credit was a subsidy to businesses to be able to pay low wages to workers and still make huge profits.  I think in a sense that is what the Obamacare is also - a subsidy to companies like Wal-Mart who do not want to pay for health care for thier workers.  So we were all paying for it anyway, at hospital emergency rooms.  I worked at Welfare and saw the flyers Wal-Mart was giving to thier employees to go apply for medicaid.  What is right about that?  There is another submission I saw on Reddit today that says poor people get the same amount of GDP as do the rich in terms of tax benefits.  Found it:  http://www.reddit.com/tb/15di1o
 And contrary to some people's believes, the rich are not job creators.  It is only a race to the bottom.  We do better as individuals and as a country when we are all doing well, not just a few. 




  I hurt for the younger generations and we need to do what we can to help them, but at the risk of starving seniors?  We have enough for everyone.  Right now, corporation's chairmans and Presidents of their boards are walking away with all of the corporate profits.  Corporations have one goal:  profits, not the improvement of society or their workers.  



 




 You are making the assumption that it is all the fault of social security and medicare.  We have been spending a billion a week for years on a war.  Social security isn't even a part of the budget.  Boomers paid 110% more than they should have to cover the costs of social security.  Americans LOVE those programs and will pay for them.  This has been a plan by republicans to starve the beast - and get rid of those programs. 




 Yep. 




 You needed the spending to avoid a huge depression.  They used to call government spending "priming the pump", when private enterprise is not spending, government needs to spend.   It didn't cost much in interest rates.  Republicans screamed about the deficit during Clinton years - and poof - it was gone in no time when everyone went to work.  It is higher now, and it will stay high through the boomer's retirement, but it is not so excessive as to break the county.  Wiki "the two-santa theory".  Large Federal spending has been historically higher under republicans.  They don't mind big-government, they just mind big-government money being spent on regular people.  They love the military and contracting with private enterprise.  We can go off the cliff, then the republicans can vote for a tax-break for 90% of the people, just not the rich. 




 Nice photo. 




 I would like to believe you are right, but I know so many crazys! 




 There are some translating companies also. 




 How about first making employees full-time.  Too many now have part-time jobs. 




 I will have to watch it.  Saw her on C-Span and she was great. 




 Yeah, let's help the corporations. Screw the people. 









 It's wierd submitting a reddit article to a subreddit! 









 Diplomacy puts Risk to shame, but you need 5-7 players, and lots of time. 




 Remember, George Bush was a cheerleader when many students were protesting the war,  And Romney was leading protests for the war.  There were two kinds of boomers. 




 isn't that how we all got started? 




 Apply online at the mgmcareers.com.  They are the major employer on the strip.  Who knows.  People do get hired.  I also know a woman who recruits for them also, normally low-paying jobs like guestroom attendents.  Mail me your resume and I'll get it to her.  She may be able to chek out if they ever hire on HIB visas, or whatever. 




 I'm so impressed.  Wish I could do this.  




 I remember Nixon's people calling him "Ain't no Way". 




 I've been wondering, if people love medicare   social security, rather than cut them, let's pay a little more for them -- with the condition that Congress can't spend the money on anything else. 




 I can't believe he is a supreme court judge.  I heard him quoting Fox News during the health care case - and he was wrong about it!  An idiot. 




 I think it is funny. 




 Congrats.  I get about 40 lbs, then breakdown, gain it back.  How do you keep going? 




 They have limitless money and they never stop.  Ethics mean nothing. 




 Escargo. 




 I wrote a term paper 40 yrs on the end of work.  We are in a transition needing less people to do more.   Check this out:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Work 




 Thank you for your thoughts. 




 I'd like to read the article! 




 I'm so tired of these boys.  Just go away..... 




 nice. 









 I'm curious too.  The areas look beautiful. 




 I keep thinking of Linda Tripp, the civil servant who screwed Monica Lewinsky and Clinton.  She was offered a much better job but without civil service benefits or protections.  She took it and a year later, was laid off.  I think this job was to entice DeMint to leave.  And he will be pushed out of his new job in a year. 




 Good luck! 




 What was your original industry?   









 I'm torn.  There is a side of me that says "You vote these guys in office, you deserve what you get".  The problem is that we all pay for it. 




 Idiot. 




 Is there a Veteran's sub-reddit?  This needs to be posted there. 









 The corporate scam, yes.  But wouldn't it be cool if we could all have it. 









 When is she up for election? 




 At one time, I build my own solar heater for my pool.  Just coiled black flexible pvc pipe on my patio roof and ran a hose through my skimmer.  The water pumped through the pipes, heated the water which flowed back into the pool.  The water in the pool was almost too hot in the summer. 




 It is totally corporate-controlled by state statute.  A co-worker had it installed on his home at an upfront cost of $50,000 (probably close to the value of my house).  He got a $15,000 rebate from NV Energy which was the exact charge of installation (and he turned it over to the installers).  I found a group online in suburban Washington D.C. was able to start a co-op with an average cost of $1,500 per house.  You can't do that here without a change in legislation.  I would be up to working on this with people who want the law changed, and have just recently started to talk with people about it.  By the way, my co-worker pays $8/mo now. 




 Do you re-register for the general election? 




 Here comes our corporate court! 




 Important point. 




 And they have a history at stopping at nothing to get what they want. 




 I still love his movies, particularly the funny ones. 




 Good luck!  It's my 40th, and it's hard to believe I am this old! 




 Beautiful! 




 You can do white boards too - like you would see in a corporate office. 




 You can buy blackboard paint that works the same way. 




 It's fun.  Has a lighted canapy over several blocks.  I hear there is a zip line now.  The strip is more spread out. 














 Didn't Fox buy the History Channel a few years back?  That should be reason enough. 




 I would agree, but they stopped the craziness of the tea party house of the last few years.  TG for the Senate. 




 They treat their employees well.  I spoke with one guy who worked for Costco, left to go into the military.  When he returned, they rehired him,  but kept his pay and seniority as if he had been with them the whole time. 




 I think National Geographic gives grants too. 




 Conspicuous consumption, but beautiful anyway 




 When I was young, we used to take the turn at Glendale going north (off the highway heading to the Valley of Fire and Moapa), and would go to Warm Springs.  In those days, they had three swimming pools open to the public.  I haven't been there in almost 30 years now, and the last time I saw it, one was privately owned, and the other two pools were empty.  I'm not sure what it is like today, but it looks like it is a wildlife area now.

There are petroglyphs at the Valley of Fire. 




 Birthers. 




 Great idea! 




 I typed pubic instead of publc in a newsletter.  Used respectfully rather than respectively in a term paper.  I've done a few more, but these are the most memorable. 




 I missed that, but like it. 









 Management ought to go to jail. 




 It's Thom Hartmann who has a daily tv and radio show. 




 I thought it was a great presentation.  I posted it to economics also. 




 Interesting.   




 Good news! 




 9 and 1/2 weeks.  Loved the movie.  The book was sick and basically, just trash. 




 I wish the workers could take over the company. 
























 I haven't been to BA, but have friends who used to go to Drink Liberally there...http://www.drinkingliberally.com.ar/ 




 They decided on the partisanship the day Obama was inaugurated. 




 Move-0n has the software.  I used it a few years ago in my precinct.  Knew who was registered, who voted daily in early voting so they could be contacted to ensure that they turned out. 









 IrishJoe is right.  http://www.reddit.com/tb/12x9rg 




 It may be 10 years until we win the state houses and then can do our own gerrymandering after the next census. 




 I've never related to the South, but I thought the article was well-developed, sensitive.  I think many older white men have seen the threat of losing their position in society also - with the rise of women in the workforce.  Obama could have appealed to them through populism, but I'm not sure they could accept it.  Thanks for the post. 









 Sleezy. 




 Long live Nate! 




 Yeah, can you imagine the House voting for it? 




 I think I would rather eat than look towards the future.  duh. 




 I received a mailing from the "Catholic Association" yesterday urging me to vote for Romney.  The flyer had 6 thumbs up for Romney, 8 thumbs down for Obama.  I'm not Catholic, but am offended. 




 What happened to those campaign emails they were supposed to release a week or so again? 




 Right. 




 Not this bad, but I noticed it twice in the 70's.  First, the Viet Nam war created a huge divide among the young and the old.  Second, I went to a meeting at the Health Department to promote my grant for a community health center.  The room was packed.  I thought the people there were to comment on my half million dollar grant.  No, they were there to speak against a $10,000 family planning grant.   I was stunned.  I also thought Watergate would end it because it seemed so bipartisan, but it didn't, only made it worse. 




 Nice. 




 Too much work and organization. 




 Will you ever hear this on tv? 




 Good for you!  And welcome to the world of sane voters. 




 http://nvdemselectionnight.eventbrite.com/#
This is the link to the Dems get-together.  It's usually pretty busy.   




 Republicans always get caught doing that they complain most about - I'm thinking about Larry Craig.  LOL. 




 There was also a related article about less work and increasing inequality - a digital Athens.  I think the real question is how do we get income to people who cannot find jobs due to automation. 









 Watch the movie "Same Time Next Year".  Our society is so screwed.  Why can't she love two people at the same time - in different ways.  Enjoy and try to get to the place where you can enjoy your time together, knowing it may never be the way you originally envisioned it. 




 I wrote grants for 25 yrs, but it's been about 15 yrs now, so not sure how much things have changed.  Federal grant mgmt offices used to like my proposals because I followed the instructions.  Lots of grant writers don't.   Look at the RFP (request for proposals).  If you know interest groups involved in the projects, ask them if they have any sample proposals to use as guidelines.   Funders generally tell you what they are looking for - and what information they want from you.  I used to joke that it was a term paper with a budget.  You want to try to make it interesting too; don't make it too dry. 




 How about deep fried twinkies.  Haven't tried them, but hear they are pretty good.
 




 I met a photographer from NG.  He had written at least one book about his career there, which I gave as a gift, so unfortunately, I can't remember his name!  He started out there as an intern and was eventually hired by them. It's been a few years now, but he had worked for them for over 25 yrs.  I think he also had 2-3 covers on the mag.  Sorry, this is the best I can offer! 




 I'll never believe it. 




 One of the Naked Gun movies. 




 Beautiful! 




 Amen. 









 I don't have children, but don't mind paying taxes for schools because it benefits our society as a whole. 




 Except you could not get one vote from any one of them for any bill. 




 I love Bill Clinton but he did a lot wrong because he caved to republicans on important values.  We got the terrible trade bills like NAFTA that offered no worker protection, he signed the bill to get rid of Glass Steagal which paved the way for the crash.  And remember how they harrassed him to death with the special prosecutor, finally impeaching him.  Now, they act like he was a saint. 




 The only way to get a long with the current republican congress is to give them everything they want.  Remember during the republican presidential debate that the question was asked "Would you take a 10 to 1 cut in spending vs tax increase" and they all said they would not accept that.  You can't work with people who don't want to work with you. 




 There are structural problems in the Senate.  You need 60 votes to get anything through.  With  Ted Kennedy being  sick and then dying, the Senate didln't have 60 votes.  Pelosi passed a ton of bills in the House that couldn't pass in the Senate.  Dems are not like Republicans.  It's hard to get 60 Dems in the Senate to agree on anything.  I do think Campaign Finance reform would help.  Both parties are too tied to fundraising, lobbiests. 




 Yeah, and now they love him. 




 I'm envious. 




 He's not on the ballot for another 4 years (Senators have 6-yr terms, not 2-years as in the House).  The Senate has some flaws that make it impossible to govern without a 60 vote majority.  Getting rid of incumbents won't help.  They have learned that term limits only turn government over to lobbiests and bearucrats because they are then the only people who understand the system.  This is not what you want.  You may want to work to change the rules.  I saw an article once (wish I could find it) that it is also possible for the House to be highjacked by a small minority (like the tea party) so the House is unable to get anything done either.  Ideally, you want majorities of the same party in both houses to be able to get things done.   




 I'm sure that is why.  




 You have to vote partisan in Nevada because it is a swing state.  You can afford to give your vote for a real progressive in California! 




 I wish there were more Bernies. 




 I know how you feel.  But trust me, things can get worse.  Many of us saw this with Bush, and look where we are at today.  If you don't live in a battleground state, go for it.  I love most of the small candidates, including Jill Stein and Rocky Anderson.  If you live in a battleground state, you have no choice but to vote for Obama.  It's too critical not to. 




 Romney didn't run for a second term because he had a 31% favorability rating.  Additionally, he vetoed 800 bills passed by the Massachusetts legislature.  I didn't link the stats, but you can find them fairly easily by googling them.  So much for bipartisanship.  We have to end this plutocracy.  Our only hope we change the constitution or find a way out of this pay for play system, and save the middle class.  Otherwise, we will all lose. 




 I thought this was a great interview.  I wish there was more interest here about it.  We have to come up with some new ways of talking about this issue - and how we are going to address the future. 




 I wish they would do something about the Romney connection to voting machines also. 




 And the rant on over-regulation.  What jerks. 




 Sorry, I'm in Las Vegas.  Uncomfortable now using more water too.  My pool has been empty now for 5 years - looks pretty bad though. 




 Not a bad idea!
