 That's rather brilliant! I was just thinking of getting some actual baby diapers to use as stuffers and putting one on her. 




 I agree with /u/Mattykinss. Munches are a great way to ease into the community and get to know others. Most munches are vanilla type events due to their public setting. 

The biggest key is to communicate. Check out the Big Little Podcast episode on [Communication](http://www.biglittlepodcast.com/2012/07/episode-56-communication/). If she already supports you in this, it sounds like you would be able to talk to her about it and have her listen. It's going to be tough, but it will be worth it in the end. Trust me, going behind her back is no bueno. And even if she doesn't want to go, at least she knows you're being upfront with her and open about it. 

One additional thought would be to find out what kink she's into (assuming you haven't done this already) and support her in that. But that's just my two cents. 




 That is adorable! 

*makes grabby hands* 




 I've got a stuffed Hello Kitty that I want to put a diaper on. 




 I am so super excited to see this company relaunching. I didn't know much until today when I started digging. But I'm excited for where you plan on taking ABU and can't wait to see what fresh ideas and changes you bring to the AB/DL community! 




 I've been there before! Quite a bit. Thankfully, I've gotten past the binge and purge stage but it's taken a while. I'm at the point where I'll wear (when I can), but I've realized that this is a part of me. I hid it with my ex-wife and let's just say that things did not go well when she found out. But, I wear when I can and have also realized that no one really knows but me. And if anyone **does** figure out, chances are they won't think it's because I enjoy wearing. So, I know it's hard to not feel that shame, but once you accept that it's a part of who you are, and the rest of the world be damned, it gets a lot easier and that shame fades. 




 I've found that pinching them together after they've gone on helps too. I haven't tried your method but I will next time I get a batch :) 




 All my friends are dead. 




 Burn it to the ground. 




 Alex the cum dumpster...

You don't want to know. 




 Serve him breakfast

Implying that I have food in my house! 




 I would contact the company you purchased them through. Talk to customer service and explain what's going on. They might want things that can be found on each package like the lot number. If it's a good company that cares about their customer, they should either offer to replace it or offer a refund. They might want you to send any unopened packages back though so that they can return them to the manufacturer.  




 That is amazing!!!!  




 It's always a great feeling to get it on just right! Congratulations!!!! 




 Ever since I got my Twilight wig, I've been in love with the purple and pink combo! 




 I want more cloth .

Mainly MLP AIOs... 




 This conversation is bringing out my little :D 




 RAWR!!!!! :D 




 I want the dinosaurs! However, my little side wants the hearts and skulls though! 




 I want some from [Pajama City](http://www.pajamacity.com) 




 I forgot to mention my shark footed sleeper! I got it at Target a couple of years ago.  




 I've got 3 kigurumi! Red Panda, Totoro and a summer totoro. 




 Shiny Captain! 




 Those are adorable!!! 




 I love the Wheel of Time universe. You're dropped in at a cataclysmic point in the history, one who's repercussions are felt through out the entire saga. During this, the journey of a multitude of characters is chronicled and you're often found wondering if one of them is the chronicler (Loial). You follow the path of Rand al'Thor as he journeys along the path that has been set for him, fighting it most of the way. Watching characters change and grow into who they will need to be is rather unique as well and one that I love. With each character, you start to develop a bond and get excited over their victories and saddened by their defeats. For example, my favorite character is Mat ([Matrim Cauthon](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/wot/images/3/32/Mat.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091212050852)). I love how he's put through a version of hell and comes out on top on the other side. From the loss of memories to those becoming a great General, it's an amazing story and one that I can go back to time and time again. 

Additionally, the community that built up around it has been amazing. There's [artwork](http://seamassketches.blogspot.com/), [table-top games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time_Roleplaying_Game) (as supported by Wizards of the Coast), even [a video game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time_%28video_game%29) was created. All of which take place in this universe with an [absentee God](http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Creator). A very real [Devil character](http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_One), even its own unique brand of [magic](http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/One_Power) which introduces even more into the lore. 

Overall, it's one of my all time favorite series and worth the time to read. 




 The issue I've had is to do with the sides. Even with everything set, if I go while laying down, there's the chance that it will rise up and leak down the sides that have no padding what so ever. Plastic pants might be able to help keep everything contained. 




 Fun fact! I used to eat sunflower seeds by the bucket. And then my body developed an intolerance to the baked shells! Now I haven't eaten sunflower seeds in over 18 years.  




 Everyone knows his parents are dead. Everyone except the person who wrote in that shitty caption. 




 I don't think all are, but a majority of them have become a platform in which to advertise. However, once people start asking questions, it's not always about the product they're pushing. It gives regular people a chance to interact with the celebs. 




 Well said good sir! 




 I am a random person and I want to wear fuzzy hats...   
























 And the guys (and gals) who work the tenders love ATON. Everyone I've ever met who worked a tender had been trying to get back to one. 




 I love how people forget that they USCG is the 5^th branch of the US Armed Services. If I recall correctly too, the High Endurance Cutters (Hamilton Class) were picked up by the USCG after being rejected by the US Navy as a ship design. Additionally, putting a CIWS right over the screw is a horrible fucking design. 




 If I had to guess, I would say that it looks like a nun buoy. 




 As a former Coastie, it warms my heart to see this! Thanks and keep up the great work!

I also managed to find all three of your easter eggs! 




 I highly doubt that. Even though they are law enforcement, every year their budget keeps getting cut and they can barely maintain their aging fleet. 




 Hopefully the tapes will be better this time around. 




 I'm now lurking in diaperfurs :P 




 Awesome! Thanks for the response! 




 Fantastic! I shall be joining both shortly! 




 Thank you! I shall check it out! 




 That's quite nice! And it looks really good on you! 




 That's sort of the problem with #biglittlepodcast on Rizon. It's great when the podcast is going on but for the most part, it's dead. I miss the old Yahoo chat groups :( 




 So freaking cute and adorable! Where did you get it? 




 Hello everyone. Does anyone know of any AB/DL specific IRC channels other than the one for the biglittlepodcast? 




 Amazing photos and costumes! Fun fact! In the book, the apprentice's name is [Michael Fisher](http://howlscastle.wikia.com/wiki/Michael_Fisher) and he's actually 15 years old. 




 Good for you! Even though Depends are generally disliked, they are a relatively cheap intro for adult diapers! Enjoy them! 




 I guess the question to ask yourself is "What are you looking to get out of all of this?" Her interests are rather small but her groups show that she's a member of a couple of AB/DL groups. So she's got some interests in the fetish even if nothing's listed in her profile. Another thing to bear in mind is that not everyone has a webcam. I know almost every laptop now has one built in, but if she has a desktop, there's no guarantee of a webcam. You could always ask if she's got an amazon wishlist and ask her to put a webcam on there that you could purchase for her too.  




 Hmmm... You might be able to find something that's fragrant free or you can try a corn starch based powder. However, you can help cut down on the smell by applying a bit less and rubbing it in. I've found that even though we can be paranoid because WE know we're diapered, most everyone else either doesn't know or if they smell it, won't care. I went to school with a gentleman who would dust his crotch with baby powder every day to help cut down on chafing. 




 TO sorta quote Spacey: "Tell them if it will further enhance your relationship." If you think it will make things between you even better, then tell her!  




 One thing I would recommend is to give your body like 30 minutes or so to air out each day. Letting your diaper area breathe a bit each day will help cut down on rashes. Also, lots of powder and/or oil or lotion. Which ever you prefer. Other wise enjoy it! What's your go-to diaper for daily wear and wearing at night?     




 At first, it seemed to be a bit cobbled together, but it's become much smoother. I feel that happens to any podcast though as they figure out what's going on and how they want things to run/flow. As for content, I love hearing the behind the stories of some of reddit's biggest celebrities. I also feel that things like banana for scale and such are so fleeting that it's like trying to hype up pogs. There one minute and gone the next. Personally though, I like hearing about the minutia and little bits of trivia that not everyone might not know about stories and people. 




 I've enjoyed this podcast! I'm starting to get into listening to podcasts and this is one of my favourites! Keep up the good work and I can't wait to listen to next weeks!  




 I love the composition of old and new. 




 Out of everything there... I want your shoes :P 




 I wish you both the best in this! 




 Great choices! Personally, I'm not a fan of Molis anymore but that's because it seems all of the padding always clumps down to the middle. 




 And time to save this page to the Diaper Supply folder! 




 So freaking cute!!!  




 I haven't tried it, but would love to. Even if there's no milk. I think it would put me in little headspace pretty quickly. 




 I wore cloth as a kid. My brother was the one to wear disposables... I might be able to make a small cloth diaper for her. 




 True, but it would look better than a 24/7 on her :P

I'm not in a rush though. But I love the idea of making my own! 







































 OH man. I think this was taken either Jungfrau or somewhere along the journey up to Jungfrau. All three (Jungfrau, Mnch and Eiger) are all part of the Bernese Alps. This photo was taken back in 2006 though, so I'm not exactly certain of the position that it was shot. 




 Curses! I have to work so no live stream for me :/

I'll write out the story in an email for you and Spacy for your show! 




 http://lildiaper.tumblr.com 














 True. But after serving with the USCG for more than a decade, there is a bit of love there :P 




 I know they're much smaller, but any chance of doing this with the aircraft of the US Coast Guard? 




 And now I need to go play Mass Effect 2....

Fantastic work though! 














 I can do that! When are you guys looking at recording this episode? 




 Gah! I used to live out there. My first real intro to ageplay with another person took place out there. I've got so many good memories of the area and want to go back so badly! 




 Thank you! 




 Awesome! I shall be waiting with baited breath :D 




 How long ago was this? 




 lol. Fair enough. Needless to say, I've loved the story and have read through it a few times! I can't wait to read what you put out next! Keep up the amazing work! 




 I don't suppose there's any plans for a sequel or another story set in the same setting (town, universe, which ever you prefer to call it) is there? 




 YES!!! I would love to see an adult pull up that isn't shit.  




 The small boat in question is a 64' SPC-SV (Special Purpose Craft - Screening Vessel). I am not sure of which sub was being escorted at that time. 









 While I agree, I don't think the USCG would be able to afford it. They can barely afford to upgrade their current fleet. And at one point, they had their ability to actually purchase new ships stripped from them by DHS! 




 I agree completely! Sadly, the Russians have a massive fleet of icebreakers. 

Edit: I was misinformed. 




 The CIWS has numerous delicate cards within it to help with targeting and what not. When the ship would get up to a good speed or even some up on the turbines, the entire ship would vibrate horribly. And those poor cards would shatter in their holders since the vibrations were horrible right above the screws. 




 The Seventh District (which covers South Carolina, Georgia and most of Florida) is one of the busiest districts if not the busiest. Miami and Key West tend to have a lot more cutters. And some of the smaller cutters (87', 110') are sometimes homeported in small towns.  




 I'll see if I can find some over the next few days :) 




 I've noticed that there are still a few cutters missing. Things like the USCGC Vise and the USCGC Joshua Appleby. I'll do some more digging when I get home. 




 There is a list! It's the [USCG Light List](http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=lightlists). It includes both federal (USCG Maintained) and private aids. 




 And each tender has a massive AOR! Not to mention that they will go help other tenders if needed.
