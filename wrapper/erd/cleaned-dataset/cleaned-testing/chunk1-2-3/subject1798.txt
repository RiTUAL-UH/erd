 Forget the ads unless you want to compete against a hundred other applicants. No matter how good you are, if you're coming off the street you're going to get lost in the pile.

Instead, identify 5 companies you want to work for. Think about what you are actually **qualified** to do, even if the only thing may be to push a broom and scrub a toilet. Try to find out an important person in that department and arrange a 15 minute meeting with them. Almost everyone will give 15 minutes to somebody who shows initiative.

Now, you have to know what they're looking for, and know something about the culture of the company. Do your research. Explain to them why their company is a fit for you and vice versa. 

If you get the job, remember 3 things:

1. Show up 5 minutes early.
2. Do something every day that isn't asked of you.
3. Stay 5 minutes late.

 I would. You'll have plenty of chances to drink KJ at parties and weddings. When you are searching for yourself, try something different. Those vineyards are trying to make a name for themselves so you might discover a real gem. I have a friend who is an excellent sommelier. He started a winemaking operation a few years ago and just released his second vintage, a 2013 sauvignon blanc, for $16.99. He put a TON of time into getting it just right for him. 




 It's always a gamble, whether at $15 or at $100. I think what you enjoy is very personal. My wife and I have very different tastes but neither is "wrong." What I like about $15 is that I'm not out a whole bunch if the wine makes me say "meh." 




 It depends on the vintner. Some $20 bottles might as well be $8. But for more reputable small-batch vintners, a $20 wine probably has a little higher quality of production. The sugars are monitored more closely to determine harvest, the destemming is more thorough, the blending is a little more deliberate to create more complexity and balance that the winemaker is seeking, and it's probably aged a little more and perhaps finish-fermented in oak or cement. 









 Thank you, Ohio State, for showing why we needed a playoff. 




 Urban Meyer has always been a gambler. We'll see if it bites him in the butt this time.

 At the end of the day, it's still about viewership for ESPN and the SEC can deliver that better than any other conference. 




 **This** is why we've needed a CFB playoff. Because OSU obviously deserves a chance to make it to the championship game. 




 Damn, Alabama is the best tackling team I've ever seen in CFB. 




 start delayed to 9 pm EST. 




 Ohio State is the only team that will give Oregon a game. Alabama would get steamrolled. 




 You will get your wish. And you will regret it. There is no school in the SEC that is prepared for the Oregon offense. It's one thing to watch film and come up with a game plan. It's a completely different thing to be on the field. 




 FSU defenders not used to defending an option. You gotta make a decision. You can't be undecided. 




 Now let's just hope for no injuries. Ducks deserve to play the championship game at full strength. Well played, Oregon. 




 Exactly. Keep your team in the game mentally. If you don't convert a 4th down, the game is over. That was not the time to make that decision. That's a last-5 minute kind of decision. 




 I can not believe the coach was willing to put the entire game on the line in the 3rd quarter. How much is FSU paying him?? 




 When a coach makes a call like that, they're telling their team that they are panicking. Dumb decision. 




 FSU deserved to lose after that stupidest decision of the entire year of any coach. 




 No way. They are risking the entire game in the 3rd quarter? Dumb decision. Bad decision. Take 3. 




 That was seriously an awesome play. FSU defense has never seen an offense like this. Class is in session for FSU. 




 Oh boy, now the ball goes back to Oregon with time left for them to score. 




 FSU can definitely move the ball on Oregon. They're just not sharp inside the 20. 




 Cry me a river. Fucking white people.

 Correct rule, wrong interpretation. You should round down to 20.  




 The rule is half plus seven.  




 A progressive tax does not necessarily eliminate the incentive to having higher income unless it's up near 100%. There is, of course, a curve--The Laffer Curve. All economic models show that a progressive tax will produce the most tax revenue while still enjoying economic productivity.

In the 50s and 60s, the United States enjoyed a tremendous boost in productivity and wealth yet the top tax rates (for the top 0.1%) are almost double what they are today. 




 No tax targets only the area in which a corporation or individual is based. It all goes into a pile and is apportioned. To look at taxes as being earmarked would lead to a gross misunderstanding of the federal revenue and apportionment system of the United States.

Second, corporations do not benefit themselves. They are set up to benefit individuals, from wage earners to shareholders. By shifting the corporate tax burden to individuals, you can more accurately tax the benefit that the individual receives.

Third, eliminating the corporate tax also eliminates the incentive for keeping profits overseas and brings more money back into the U.S. where it helps Americans, rather than helping foreign economies. 




 If you ask economists, some of the proposals that almost all of them agree on would include:

* Eliminate corporate taxes - companies can reinvest more money into their businesses and create more jobs.
* Eliminate mortgage interest deduction - this deduction distorts the housing market and tends to give more benefit to wealthier people.

There are others but these are the two biggest ones off the top of my head. 




 As others have already stated, Duverger's Law is at work here. The "winner takes all" system practically guarantees that up to half of a district's citizens will be disenfranchised. I see it as a major reason for today's voter apathy.

 Glucose is a monosaccharide, meaning that its a single sugar molecule. It's pretty much the only thing cells burn for fuel. You are right that when you eat glucose, it goes directly into the blood to be used by your cells. Fructose heads to the liver where it's metabolized into lipids (fat). Here's where you went off track:  sucrose is a disaccharide, meaning it has two sugar molecules bonded together. Sucrose is 50/50 glucose and fructose. HFCS is 55% fructose, 41% glucose so the two really aren't that different. It's best to get your glucose from grains and avoid sugar altogether.  




 "You can be whatever you want to be."  Bullshit.  




 I had an awesome BK experience a couple of days ago. I put in my order for 2 whopper combos and I watched as my cashier overfill the French fry holders (what are they actually called, anyways?). He actually pounded the scooper and holder on the counter to get as many fries into the holder as he could. Then, after putting the fries and burgers in the bag, he took the scooper and dumped a bunch more fries into the bag. That has never happened before and may never happen to me again.

 There are a lot of social and financial factors at play. Essentially this is the result of cheap, easy debt and the 30 year mortgage. The price of something is set by how much somebody is willing to pay. If somebody is willing to spend 30 years paying for something and are able to get a loan with a monthly payment of upwards of 35% of their gross earnings, it will likely drive up the price of that item. And because the fed keeps the lending rate so low, banks can charge lower interest rates on mortgages. Does that mean people will lower their mortgage payments or be willing to pay a higher principal for homes? The latter. Again, this drives up the price of homes. 

But that money comes from some other part of the economy. Food, clothes, vacations, retail goods. All of these suffer.

 The ratio of the national debt to the U.S. GDP isn't high compared to historic levels. 

The idea is that a free or low cost education would be incentive for more people to get post-high school degrees, thereby attracting companies with a smarter, more capable workforce. This in turn would increase salaries and result in higher tax revenues. 




 Yes, and thanks for a better explanation than mine. 




 My response assumes you're referring to the U.S. economy.

The U.S. borrows at an incredibly low interest rate, in the tenths of percent. That's because the creditworthiness of the U.S. is high. People like buying U.S. debt because it's a safe place to park their money.

The U.S. gets enormous benefit from this. Let's say you make a really cool widget out of your garage. By yourself you make one a day. A rich uncle is willing to loan you $500,000 at 0.15% interest. You can use that money to buy more equipment, hire and train workers. Now you are earning 10X or 100X what you were earning before, AND employing people. That's a multiplier effect on your GDP. You'd be stupid not to take the money.

The U.S. uses debt to build roads, networks, satellites and pays for research that benefits everyone, and a military to protect all of it. In other words, that debt helps the producers produce more in a safe and fairly well regulated market.

 This example is about lying after receiving immunity. Maybe not exactly what you're looking for? You may not get charged with making a false statement if you have more serious charges in front of you, but it wouldn't look good for you if the case made it to court.

11th Circuit Court of Appeals: 
*Giving a false statement is an independent criminal act that occurs when the individual makes the false statement; it is separate from the events to which the statement relates, the matter being investigated...We agree with the circuits that have addressed this issue before us and have determined that Garrity-insulated statements regarding past events under investigation must be truthful to avoid future prosecution for such crimes as perjury and obstruction of justice. Garrity protection is not a license to lie or to commit perjury.*

 Dude, it sounds like she is way needy for affirmation. That's why she needs you to affirm that you still put her on a pedestal and I suspect that's also why she had the affair. 

It's a double-edge sword. It may be part of why you were attracted to her to begin with (that she needs constant affection from you) but it appears that, like any drug, its effect wears off and she will go looking for more affection from other places. Until she gets some psychological help to understand why she went looking for the thrill in the first place, I'd be pretty careful.

But then, if she somehow fixes what is wrong with her, she may not be the same person you fell in love with. 




 You are right with your example. If the act of drinking itself is a crime then you don't have to admit to it. It's the same as pleading not guilty to a judge even though you did commit the crime; you are presumed innocent until proven guilty.

 Compass headings aren't accurate enough for cross country flight, especially when you have crosswinds (meaning the aircraft's nose is pointed in a different direction than it's actually flying. General aviation (private pilots mostly) use a lot of dead reckoning (i.e. looking out the old window). Commercial aircraft flying at high altitudes tune in to radio beacons called NDBs, VORs (and even AM radio stations) and they sort of zig-zag across the country flying straight from radio tower to radio tower.

 Power (Watts) = Potential (Volts) x Flow (Current)

I'm rewriting my explanation to make it applicable to solar panels.... hold on.

Solar panels are rated in watts. A good analogy is water coming through your garden hose and you've got your thumb on the end of it. Your thumb is the resistance (ohms). When you increase your thumb's resistance, you increase the water pressure (which is comparable to volts) and decrease the volume (which is comparable to amps). Your municipal water pumping station is like the wattage. A more powerful pump (higher watts) will increase the water pressure and/or water flow.

 The three Constitutional amendments that give the Supreme Court authority are:

* The 10th: Federal powers

In other words, States can define marriage but not in any way that would violate Constitutional protections. They can, for example, set minimum-age requirements, who can or cannot perform the ceremony, divorce laws, but they can't discriminate by telling people who they can marry (Loving v. Virginia). 




 Public schools are funded from tax revenue and generally must accept everyone who lives within their district. It's a lengthy and almost impossible process to kick someone out of public school. Public schools are governed by an elected school board.

Private schools get no funding from tax revenue. There is an application process and it's easy to kick someone out. They are not required to administer any of the standardized tests that public schools do.

Charter schools are public schools with an application process. They receive a predetermined amount of money per student that they accept and it's generally fairly easy to kick someone out. They must also perform all testing required by state and federal laws. Charter schools are governed by their own boards established by their own bylaws. 




 Frying in oil produces a crispy texture because it has a high boiling point. Unlike potato chips, fries and tater tots aren't cooked to the point of driving all moisture out. They retain some moisture. As soon as you take them out of the fryer the moisture starts to affect the texture of the food. The longer you wait the worse it gets. The refrigerator just makes more moisture collect on the surface since less of it evaporates in the cold air. 




 In Utah they used a variation of the "Please, think of the children" theme. The Utah AG's office argued to the court that the State has an interest in promoting child birth and stable families, and that same-sex marriages hurts the institution and somehow dissuades opposite-sex couples from marrying.

Never mind that:

* There are opposite-sex couples who can't conceive, yet are still granted marriage licenses.

* Divorce rates and the number of single-parent households are higher than ever under current marriage laws.

 Incomplete compared to what we know today, but not wrong. Evolution (speciation) was well known prior to Charles Darwin. What Darwin did was explain how it worked. Prior to Origin of the Species, people thought, for example, that giraffes stretched their necks through the process of reaching for the leaves on the upper branches of trees and passed this on to their offspring. Darwin came up with the theory of natural selection, that mutations (they were thought of as natural variations at that time) which gave an individual a small advantage would be passed on while variations that decreased survival would obviously decrease the chances that individual would produce offspring. 




 Money is probably the greatest economic invention of all time. It lets people get things that they need without actually having to trade for it, and to let people become specialists which accelerated technological advancement.

Before money, there were no people who only were masons because they would go hungry since they would have to trade work directly to a farmer for food. After money, the farmer paid the mason, which allowed him to focus on farming without having to know how to build his house. The mason took the money and paid toolmakers who then paid other farmers for their food.

Humans being what they are, a moneyless society would break down pretty fast because there would always be slackers who just rely on asking others for help without giving much effort in return. 




 Bold red wines have high levels of tannins at bottling time. The tannins, which help preserve the wine, come from the grape skins as well as the oak barrels during secondary fermentation. The grape skins and the oak add complexity but the tannins are so astringent that you will have a more difficult time tasting the subtleties. The tannins break down over time (depolymerize) to reveal the wine's nature.

You can help a young high-tannin wine be more drinkable by decanting it to introduce a lot of oxygen which depolymerizes the tannins. If you want to do this instantly, use a blender (seriously, works great). 




 Because the value of a car depreciates rapidly. If you finance a car, you are more likely to justify purchasing a new or newer model based on your monthly payments. If you pay cash, you are more likely to purchase a used car where the money you lose through depreciation is significantly less than any income you would have gained from the interest by investing the difference. If you even invest it at all. 




 The amount of debt compared to GNP/GDP is quite low. The two aren't independent. The U.S. debt helps us push GDP to its high levels because it funds education grants to make smarter citizens, police and regulatory agencies to help ensure competition, tax incentives to build factories that employ people, roads to transport goods, and a military to protect that economic engine and keep it humming. 




 It depends on the bread recipe too. Ever tasted old butter? Staleness is mostly caused by fats getting oxidized. Breads that have no fat (like bagels) won't taste stale but they dry out, lose their texture and harden faster.

By the way, the same applies to meats. Ever wondered why meat stews and chilis can last in a fridge but grilled steak, even wrapped tight, doesn't? The meat in a stew is covered by liquid which inhibits oxidation of the fats. 




 I think it mostly depends on the speaker design. A speaker can cap the voltage with a small circuit. It still sounds like shit for exactly the same reason but it won't cause any damage.

 On the positive side, you don't have to see the players you've cut every day.  




 CharlieKillsRats has the only correct answer so far.

Look at this way:  Imagine you're a widget craftsman making widgets in your garage. You're not in any debt and you make a decent living producing 1 widget a day. Now imagine that you're also a cool dude that has always paid his bills on time so tons of people want to give you money so you can build a factory and hire workers, and they only want a couple points interest because you're so trustworthy. You will increase your earnings 10X, maybe 100X, and you're going to employ a whole bunch of people. You'd be stupid not to take the money.

That's the U.S. economy to the outside world. Except they are willing to accept as little as 0.22% interest (that's actually the 1 year t-bill rate right now).

The difference between countries like the U.S. and Germany as opposed to many other "first world" countries is that the U.S. actually does a great job converting debt into production. This encourages more people to invest, which accelerates the productivity, keeps standard of living high and interest rates low. 




 The two things that the amplifier supplies the speaker is voltage level and frequency. When you play too loud, it's not the frequency that is too high for the speaker but the voltage level.

Frequency determines how quickly the speaker cone moves back and forth creating low pitch (slow oscillation) or high pitch (fast oscillation). The voltage level determines how *FAR* the speaker moves during the oscillation, which determines how loud or soft the sound is.

If the amplifier overdrives the speaker, distortion happens because the speaker cone can't go any further, i.e. it maxes out. Instead of the air molecules moving in a smooth wave, there are sharp corners. These sharp corners don't sound good. 




 I was a non-teaching male coach of the girls soccer program at a Catholic high school, and I'm not even Catholic. So I was as outside as can be. I was an assistant when the previous head coach retired and that's how I got the job. Winning a couple of state championships and having a nationally ranked team didn't hurt either.

1. Get a teacher on staff to be a liaison. This is invaluable. They help arrange buses, get grades to you, take care of last minute changes, help get the word out, and their room is a place to hold meetings and for kids to put stuff or hang out while waiting for games to start.

2. Since you're not at the school full time, it's hard for parents to come to you so go out of your way to make yourself available to parents. Find some way to have weekly "office hours."

3. Plan. Plan. Plan. Set your game and practice schedule as early as possible. Arrange the buses. Have it in writing and published to the school and parents.

4. Get good team parents (team moms, if you aren't PC). Have them handle parental liaison as much as possible:  Fundraising, uniform orders, team dinners, barbecues, playoff special events.

5. Make sure you go to all the athletic staff meetings. The other teacher-coaches will appreciate you more. Go to their games and support them. Be a part of the school, not just your particular team. You score big points when parents and students see you in the crowd as a supporter.

6. Make sure you thank the teachers that help you or come to your games. They will in turn support your players in school. This is huge for the kids and since you're not a teacher there, they aren't going to get those platitudes from you during the day.

6. I'm sure I'll think of more....

 Eye contact.



And nice legs. 




 No, the photo will be out of focus for everyone because it was out of focus on the film plane due to your manual focusing without wearing glasses.

The viewfinder should have a diopter adjuster to let you compensate for this. If you wear your glasses you should also push back the rubber cup around the viewfinder so your eyeball is about the same distance away as without glasses. 




 Helmets only reduce surface injuries like fractures, lacerations and contusions. They do very little to reduce brain injuries because that occurs when the brain impacts the inside of the skull.

If you hit your head hard enough to cause a concussion, all that force will get transmitted to your brain regardless of whether you have a helmet on or not. You may not crack your skull though, so that's good enough reason to wear a helmet. 




 Emails are fine but are easier to brush aside so follow up if you don't hear from them. 




 Normally aspirated (ie non-turbo) car engines get their power from compression and so are sensitive to ambient air pressure. Aircraft engines do not. They get their thrust from ignition exhaust. To understand why airplanes work better at 40,000 feet, you have to understand how they fly.

There is a relationship between thrust, drag, altitude and ground speed. Lift causes drag and to keep an airplane in the air, you must have enough thrust to overcome that drag. A plane's cruising *airspeed* for any given burn rate is the same regardless of the altitude. What changes with altitude is *ground speed*. (Disregarding winds)

At lower altitudes, the air density is high thus creating a lot of drag which slows down the plane and results in lower ground speed. At higher altitudes and lower air density, the drag is significantly lower thus allowing the aircraft to fly at a much faster ground speed. 30,000-40,000 feet are well within the normal abilities of the engine to maintain cruise and climb.

TL;DR:  Airplanes get thrust from igniting fuel in a combustion chamber, not from compression. Less drag at 40,000 feet from lower air density means faster ground speed, less flying time and less fuel burned on the trip.

Me:  Private pilot. 




 If you're a franchisee, a gift card sale doesn't go to your bottom line. It's net-zero because the cost of goods is 100%--all of it goes to corporate. They will reimburse you when you actually sell a grande latte. So in other words, you sell gift cards as a duty to the franchise even though you don't make a dime from it unless it's stipulated contractually that you get some percentage. 




 Ignore the ads. Even advertised jobs are likely to go to somebody who knows somebody. Seriously, large companies always have openings that aren't currently advertised, or they can make one for somebody who they like.

If you're terrified, tell them so. Say "I just got in town and I found your company. I really like your culture but coming in here to talk to you is something that would normally terrify me." Nothing wrong with that.

Good luck, and let me know how it goes! 




 Humans are social creatures. Humor greases social interaction and gets you in the club/clan/whatever. Subjective humor is just adapting humor to a community whose culture may "get it" whereas others may not.

Example:  Fart humor isn't subjective. It's always funny. /r/watchpeopledie may be funny to a group who would likely get along with each other fairly well, but not very funny to others.

 You already answered your question.
 
*Floating can be defined along the lines of: An object in a fluid experiences an upward force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.*

Whether it's laser etched metal, wood or concrete, they all obey the laws of physics. 




 @lisaslover has a good point but I will go ahead and answer your generalized question with a generalized answer.

*In General* many immigrant families do not feel social stigma about wearing glasses. In fact, in some cultures it signals that you are wealthy enough to get glasses and you have an office job rather than being a laborer. Many immigrants, include those from Asia, place a high importance on school and getting good grades. They probably tend to have their children's vision checked early and regularly and will correct it even at levels where other parents may not. Asian kids tend to be less into sports and therefore may not choose contact lenses which have higher incidences of secondary eye problems such as infections. 




 Can you be more specific? There are a lot of issues. 




 It doesn't "go" anywhere. On a hard drive there is an area that is hidden to you called a file directory. It's a catalog of all of the files on your hard drive, i.e. where the data starts and where the data ends. When you delete a file the catalog entry is deleted, not the data itself. The space once occupied by that file gets cataloged as free space that can be written-over when you save a different file. 




 Because you may decide to have another child some day. If there are enough people who are unvaccinated then the virus will be circulating in the community and your newborn, who can't be vaccinated for several years, will be at mortal risk. 




 I think it would be. But that window has passed and now we have a massive stalemate. Withdrawal is now practically impossible for Israeli politicians. Israel has the strongest economy in the middle east outside the oil kingdoms and there is massive immigration that they are dealing with. If I recall, pretty much any Jew can move to Israel. Netanyahu's answer is permanent development of the West Bank.

The ironic thing is that the immigration has also brought in more and more liberal views of non-Israeli Jews who grew up in Western countries. So maybe there is hope for a solution 20 or 30 years down the road. 




 You must win by more than the spread. The 1/2 point is just to help people understand that concept but it's not required. So if it's New England +10 then they have to win by 11 for you to collect. Books will say +10.5 points so they don't get a whole lot of questions if NE wins by 10. But whether it's +10 or +10.5, it's the same thing. 




 To make sure you either win or lose. In betting, ties are bad. 




 In a lot of ways, Palestine was a pawn. The 6 day war was ostensibly fought over Palestinian territory (from which Israel was carved) but it was really a political fight between Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Iraq vs. Israel. Like Vietnam, Palestine was a proxy for a war of religion/ideology/politics.

Without going into whether Israel did have or did not have a right to exist, had Israel withdrawn from the West Bank after its victory, I think relationships in the middle east would be much different today. 




 Because Israel is under the protection of the United States. The United Nations is powerless since the U.S. holds a seat and a veto on the Security Council. All they can do is issue demands that Israel halt development and occupation of west bank territories. They have no ability to force it. 




 I'm confused. Don't you mean that it's therefore both? After all, vulnerabilities get patched so isn't it a case that the initial design (done by humans) did not adequately anticipate an attack or improperly coded a function, thus creating a security hole? 




 They are therefore they can? Or they can therefore they are? 




 And you can't counterfeit gold or silver, so it's a stable for monetary use. There's also enough of it to mint coins for commerce (unlike other precious metals like paladium). 




 Cool. I think that makes sense. It's gotta be the forces right at the mouth. But that means the only surface that the force can act upon to MOVE the noodle into the mouth would be surface imperfections that transmit the force from high pressure to low, left to right (in relation in your drawing).

ASCII art:

    F --/\   F --/\  F --/\
    -----  --------  -------  ----
    NOODLE
    ---------  ------  -------  --
          --\/   --\/    --\/ 




 Ahhh, very plausible. 




 cnash, that is a very good analysis, except for one problem:  Axial stress. A wet noodle will distort under even very low loads. 




 That's what I'm thinking too. That it requires air movement and the air must be pushing on surface imperfections.

If you had a perfect seal between the noodle and your lips that did not allow any air to come through, the noodle would not move (even if there were no friction whatsoever). If the noodle surface were completely smooth, the noodle also would not move as the air passing over it has no surface to push on that doesn't have an opposite cancelling force.

So pressure differential doesn't fully explain the noodle movement. There must be air movement to make the noodle move. 




 It's still cylindrical, even when it's sitting between the lips and in your mouth. Ok, bye bye. 




 That's kind of my question. Sorry if I didn't explain well. What forces are not canceled? There must be a surface for the air to push on. Which part of the noodle? The itty bitty end? The cylindrical surface? 




 The noodle is cylindrical. Wouldn't the forces cancel if applied equally around the cylinder? 




 The noodle is cylindrical. All the forces would then cancel each other out. 




 When you blow on a balloon, it moves because there is more pressure on one side of the balloon than the other. Ever tried to push a wet spaghetti noodle? Yeah, it's all connected to itself but it's not stiff, therefore force does not transfer well. 




 To what part of the noodle is that pressure (force) being applied? 




 You know, I've asked this question of my friends and I gotta say, this is the best answer I've heard yet! 




 I get that your mouth is creating a vacuum but vacuum does not exert force. The force must come from the positive air pressure outside the mouth. What part of the noodle is the force pushing on? 




 The waves of a microwave oven are tuned to heat the water, which is exactly what you want when defrosting something frozen (because the water is what is frozen). Oven heat is absorbed by all of the mass of whatever you're defrosting. 




 Depends on where you're standing. Sound waves can add or cancel as they mix together.

(That's the science behind noise canceling headphones, which actually create a sound that is opposite in phase to the noise it's cancelling.) 




 If you lock up all the ones who test positive, you would save a lot of lives but at the expense of mistakenly imprisoning people who will never commit that crime. If you don't lock them up, more innocent people will die as a result. 




 There are a lot of visits to see an orthodontist and their assistants that all earn a wage, in a building that has an associated lease. And that orthodontist has paid for a bunch of equipment that they need, and malpractice insurance because you never know whether the kid who is getting braces is the child of a lawyer. 




 Nobody strives to create a healthy job market. They strive to create a product or service that people want, that they can charge money for and get rich off it. The job creation is just a side benefit. 




 If you took mass from the moon and brought it to earth then there is no net difference in the system. The moon would be lighter but Earth would have more mass and would exert more gravitational pull on the moon (I think). So from the laws of thermodynamics there won't be any change. 




 It's a civil contract. Jail and fines are to punish criminal violations. 

In a civil contract, when the contract is breached you would sue in civil court. You would show that you were damaged by the actions of the other party and request some monetary amount of compensation. 




 Although society doesn't look at it this way, sexuality is supposedly a spectrum. I could see for someone who is in the middle of the spectrum (we would call them bisexual, I suppose), you could feel that way about the opposite sexes. 




 Cold soggy pasta is exactly why I don't like cold pasta so your explanation of pizza crust vs. pasta makes sense. To me, cold pizza crust is OK and I don't mind eating cold pizza at all. But I have to heat up leftover pasta because the cold noodles just taste all wrong to me. 




 If you need glasses it means your eyeball isn't perfectly round. If you're nearsighted like the majority of people, your eyeball is too long. Eyeglasses correct this by distorting the view and under-focusing so that the focus point correctly hits the back of your eyeball. 




 I thought I was clicking on "Compilation of girls from Russia." Then I thought WTF is this? Then I enjoyed it. Then I actually read the title. 









 Nice to know. They'll go on the market as soon as I get the new ones mounted. I dropped by Level9Sports yesterday and picked up some Head GTO 15 (DIN 5-15) for $99. 




 Modern structural plywood   wood frame homes can withstand quite a bit. Wood is great until you have to go over 4 or 5 stories, then it becomes a liability. 




 OK, tall highrise. Mass all the way up. The ground moves, the mass of the upper floors don't want to move, due to inertia. Shit bends.

In a steel frame high rise, an earthquake can damage and weaken the framework of the lower floors, thus causing the entire building to collapse.

You weld angle braces to strengthen the floors, like [these.](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_sd4aOA0Ur-I/SwNmHworrkI/AAAAAAAAIls/Gi4TDp-Q8AI/f0720025_thumb%5B3%5D.jpg?imgmax=800) But they can buckle due to axial load if they bend too far, so you put a concrete jacket around them, like [this](http://enr.construction.com/images2/2012/11/enr11052012cs_stadium_brbA.jpg) to keep them from going outside spec. 




 Females don't derive benefit from multiple partners as they can only be pregnant with one child at a time. Males can produce multiple pregnancies thus derive benefit. 




 Humans don't produce a lot of offspring, relative to other species. We don't have litters like dogs or produce thousands like a spider's egg sac. The goal is quality: Produce the best offspring and help them live.

So there's a tension between male and female. Females tend towards monogamy because they need a stable provider to help protect the few offspring. Males have tendencies to spread their seed around since they get so few opportunities to produce offspring. 




 Yes, I think Syriza will cave. They said what they needed to get elected. After all, politics is still about power. But when they face reality I can't imagine that they can be that stupid. 




 The trial was a farce from start to finish. There wasn't a jury that tried Saddam Hussein. It was a tribunal with American and British "legal advisors." His execution occurred less than two months after the verdict was rendered. Both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch deemed the trial "unfair" and the U.N. declined to support it or its verdict because it did not meet international standards. The first chief judge of the tribunal actually resigned during the trial because he said that the U.S. and Iraqi governments were interfering and influencing the court. He was replaced. Saddam's lawyer was kidnapped and assassinated during the trial by Shias dressed as Iraqi police but the trial continued. One of Saddam's American lawyers, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsay Clark also decried the tribunal as unfair, and said that it was merely a show trial, that the U.S. was in fact running it while using Iraqis as a front.

The events for which he was tried occurred in 1982. But it wasn't until AFTER 9/11/2001 that America was interested in invading Iraq, capturing Saddam to put him on trial. 




 Pretty good summary. People are concerned about Greece and its weight on the Euro but I don't think people actually think a Greek exit is likely since it would set them back into the stone age. 




 As others have said, it shows that light behaves like a wave and a particle. This is how it works:

When you shine light through a thin slit, what you see on the wall behind it is not a distinct line but a fuzzy line. This shows that light is gravitationally bent by the edges of the slit as it passes through, therefore it must have mass.

Now you add a second slit and a second light so that the two images on the wall overlap. The slits polarize the light. If the lights do not behave like a wave then you will just see that the area that is overlapped will be brighter when you turn on the second light. But that's not what you see. Instead, you see alternating bands of dark and light. That's because two waves coming from different angles, as they mix, will cancel each other out in some spots and increase the energy in other spots. 




 Except that a photon is a particle and obeys particle physics. Its path bends, reflects and refracts and it imparts momentum and force. 




 Do explain why the IRS is unconstitutional when we have this thing called the sixteenth amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and whether you believe that the U.S. Supreme Court has the power to make decisions on this matter? 




 They want to get elected and they live in a right wing community.

Edit:  Sorry, that's not a helpful answer but I honestly don't know of any logical basis for their claim other than populism. The 16th amendment to the Constitution gives the federal government the ability to tax. 




 I'm fine with DIN 8. No knee injuries (knock on wood) and I have confidence in my skis. I'll take others' advices and swap out the bindings. 




 Even though you don't feel it though your feet, your house is likely passing on the vibrations caused by the moving air that is generating sound waves as it moves around your house. 




 As girls enter and go through puberty, they begin thinking sexually. It's parentally and socially acceptable for a girl to express sexual desire through a boy band poster and not through putting up pictures of boy classmates all over their room.

Secondly, boy bands are idealized targets of affection. They represent success (and thus stability) so are biologically appealing to girls as they approach child-bearing ages. 




 Your example is interesting but by itself doesn't portray an accurate picture. Where do you get your food costs? In Canada, food comes from grocery stores whose prices are fairly standard. In Nicaragua, I suspect without having been there that there are public markets whose prices vary greatly with availability and your ability to barter. Secondly, there are other costs to living in either place such as taxes, housing and transportation, as well as the differences in unemployment rates (i.e. the supply of workers which affects the wages offered). The economies of Canada and Nicaragua are very different. 




 I can't speak for the accuracy of the image but when Alexander The Great and his Macedonian army traveled through and conquered the area, they left quite a bit of genetic material. There are whole villages of blonde, blue-eyed Afghanis and a high prevalence of heterochromia. 




 Dead reckoning: If you know where you started and you fly a compass bearing for a certain amount of time at a certain airspeed, you should know where you are, theoretically. It's how Amelia Earhart and her navigator found her way around the world. 




 Good idea.  




 No offense taken. I already feel tweaks in my knees just from normal everyday shit. The last thing I want is physical therapy   rehab. 




 I'm 5'7", 155 lbs, 45 years old. I live in Utah and have been skiing for 30 years. I don't race but can ski any resort terrain. I got a nice deal on some Dynastar Omeglass stock race SL skis. They come with PX18 race bindings. The lowest DIN is 10. I currently run DIN 8 and my bindings have never released inappropriately. I'm a little nervous about going to DIN 10. Should I be? 

 




 Because the species Americanus Publicus is not considered to be very intelligent. They tend to believe that any action is better than inaction, and are easily swayed by populist politicians who know that the individual members of this species are too lazy to fact check anything that is said.

 God, I miss the old days. 




 It's interesting this guy said it was painless. I remember reading a story written by another host (is that what you would call them?) who had larvae on his back which he also decided to carry full term in the name of science. He said the emergence was the most painful thing he ever experienced in his life. 




 I think they're the hooks that the human botfly larvae has on its body to prevent anyone from trying to pull it out. I believe they retract when the larvae starts emerging. Pretty interesting little creatures. I studied up on them after a trip to the tropics that resulted in some skin boils that I thought may have been botfly larva.

 You are a failed human being if you can't install a car seat. 




 You're welcome! I recommend "Political Philosophy, a very short introduction" by David Miller. It can be read in about 1-2 hours and it gives a pretty good background for further reading if you get hooked. In one of my favorite college courses we read "History of Political Philosophy" by Leo Strauss. 




 NATO stands for North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It started of as a collection of western european countries and the U.S. who entered an agreement that if any of them were to come under military attack, the others would be obligated to come to their defense. It's a herd defense strategy and it was done to counter any possible aggression by the Soviet Union.

NATO's mission is now obviously moot. The past few military uses haven't been to defend NATO countries but ostensibly for humanitarian aid and NATO *interests* (Yugoslavia, Libya and Syria for example). Critics say that NATO should be disbanded and a new treaty be crafted that more accurately accounts for modern threats. 




 If you define reaction as seeing-brain processing-muscle reaction:

The neuro pathways of a fly are on a much smaller scale thus impulses just don't have very far to go from the eyes to the brain.

A fly's response is actually quite complicated and researchers are still trying to figure out how they make decisions when a predator is approaching. It turns out they have a really wide variety of moves and are unpredictable. 




 @ChickinSammich, thanks for the answer. Makes sense. I'm going to mark this as explained. 




 They have oil too, lots of it. The profits from the oil are put into a sovereign wealth fund that basically gives everyone an annuity. Pretty sweet but not everybody gets to have oil in their backyard. Damn, wish I was finn. Well, except for the winters. 




 How quickly people forget 2008.

By the way, Romney promised he would get unemployment down below 6% in 4 years. Obama did it in 2. 




 It's human nature. We are all guilty of being too optimistic about something. For example, influenza kills 53,000 people a year in the U.S. but few of us go get the flu vaccine. 




 I don't know if you should just assume the business owner wouldn't spend that money. Even if he just put it in the bank, it's capital that the bank can use to make a loan. 




 That's a good question. I'll start with some sociopolitical philosophy. A society develops when a bunch of people get together and agree to live by a set of rules. It can be all the citizens of the United States and the rules are the U.S. Constitution, or it can be a bunch of guys in an apartment and the rules are written on a piece of paper on the fridge. For the guys in the apartment, they may all agree on "common expenses" like toilet paper, detergent, dishes, etc. and each has to pitch in $50 a month towards the common costs. That's a tax.

A country uses a tax to provide for the common good:  Roads, military, jails, schools, though you may not get a direct benefit from all of the things they spend money on. 




 As I understand it, the ACA isn't a the government competing against a business, but a set of laws that basically say you have to buy health insurance, and it gives states some money to subsidize the low income earners? 




 All debt has a term and the U.S. is always paying off debt as it matures. It has not defaulted (yet). What John Maynard Keynes envisioned was that a country would stop borrowing when the economy was good and it no longer had to stimulate it. 




 The argument for a capital gains tax that is lower than income tax is because you could lose all of your invested capital whereas if you are working for wage income you won't ever actually lose money to your company. Secondly, you must invest for at least a year before you can realize that lower rate. It's a way to reward people for taking the risk of investing longer-term.

The counter argument to this is that the returns on investment already includes the risk. By lowering the tax rate on one versus another investment you introduce an artificial force that distorts the market.

I inform, you decide :)
