 Dude, Where's Batman's Car? 









 While I do think this is well done, it's just another poster of someone looking away at something. Too many of those 




 I'd say one of my favorites is Coffee of Lies. 




 I remember back in the pre-season where Rex Grossman and John Beck were competing for the starting job, and The Redskins went undefeated in the preseason. It looked like we were on pace for a great season, but ultimately had once again another terrible one. I know RGIII looked less than good but I'm just saying that this is preseason so don't get too sad yet. 




 Which role did you have the most fun playing? 




 I don't carrot all what you say. 














 You fuck......that's pretty funny though 




 What does that mean? 









 RIP 









 I asked this question on the same day, and yet you get the credit. Fucking balls 




 The movie, 'Little Fucker' it looks terrible but oh so good 









 Hey I wanna pla 









 I think Lebron is doing this because he realizes that Cleveland does not have the players to win a championship. Make the finals? Sure why not, East is pretty weak (getting better I may add). But against the west? I don't think so. 














 Come on guys don't have a cow. 









 Pet Sematary, after the Dad trips and......you know.  




 From the picture I thought this would say Tom Hardy used to be a stand up comedian. 









 Who else thought this was Jason Bateman to direct a new Star Wars movie at first? 




 Only God Forgives red band trailer. 




 Walk into the club lik......*sigh* you get the damn point. 
























 Brian Hoyer.......fuck 




 I want to see a sack on Palmer so bad 









 Good game Guys but i don't think our defense can hold much longer. I'm impressed though. To the Cardinals! 




 Speaking of Bored

You're the worst! 




 I'll take 2 TD's from Royal please with a side of 50+ yards 




 Same with Brown and Bell -___- 




 Antonio Brown please get me 1 TD PLEASE!!!!! 









 They're showing the Vikings-Falcons game I yard of the 49ers game? Why????? 
























 Losing feeling in my toes. 




 Winner winner chicken dinner 




 Zodiac, I personally think this is Fincher's masterpiece. 




 Why run at all? 




 Yeahhhh if you could chuck a deep pass to Crabtree for a TD that'd be greatttt.  




 Pick 6 with Fitz calling it now 




 Why 2 fucking lost touchdowns FUCKING TWO!!!!!!! 




 I got Alfred Morris for a TD first quarter  




 Remember when the Skins beat Dallas for the division and you just felt we we're finally relevant again and had a victory that meant something big? Then we ended up winning 3 games the following season. I want to see this team win again, I want that great feeling again this Sunday soooo bad. Let's hope it happens. 




 Make it happen browns 




 Thanks for having faith in us Bill. 









 oh I know its not, let me dream man. 




 Hopefully Rg3 and Alfred Morris. 




 Do you think you can actually win or make it to the Super Bowl? Do you think your team can win your division? Can you're team win more than you did last year? What fantasy can you actually see come true this season? 




 I really hope this isn't a blow out, but im getting that feeling. Which team will be on what end though, that's the question. 




 Probably no Super Bowl this year, but can we get at least over 5 wins? Can Rg3 come back to form? Can we sweep the Eagles, Cowboys, or Giants? Can we win the divsion??? What is your fantasy that you can see actually happening? 




 Something something every thread 
























 AARE YOU READY FOR DISSAPOINTMENT!!!!! 




 Well fuck 




 Classic skins, D keeps us in it until the end 




 Can we discuss how non threatening this 49er team is, they are fucked against the Seahawks. 




 Wow horrible play call on 3rd and 5 




 Spoiler alert RG3's going to get sacked 




 Dont you be talkin bout my bow tie! 




 Oh yeah, well this isn't meth. 




 A top 10 play gone just like that, fuck you Cox 




 I got a little worried when I saw a Patriots player next to the word committed. 




 Fuck. 




 Come on lads, we got a doo sumfen, and that sumfen is ou and ou and ou! 




 How bout that bomb to Desean, if we can get more of those it will be amazing! I can't wait to play the Bucs! 




 Hopefully he doesn't fall due to some Tropic Thunder and cause Collateral damage Far and Away from land in the Rain, Man that sure would suck to fall out of the Vanilla Sky. Hopefully A Few Good Men will save him so he's not eaten by Lions, For lambs that would be odd, or attacked by a Last Samurai in the Knight and Day......Top Gun. 














 Can this defense actually make a stop? 




 Based Graham keeping dem Ingram YD hopes alive 




 Please Ingram just one 1 more TD ease Ingram 




 Get Cadet the fuck outta here 




 Run the clock with Ingram now MUHAHAHAHA 




 That was Ingram's TD you bastard! 




 I want to hug every motherfucka in this sub!

 Kerrigan I love you......but FUCKKKKKK 




 Please don't have Colt run it please I have a felling they will though. 




 The prophecy is coming true......sorry though Cowboys. 




 Definition of Redskins football. Still love the team though 




 Please come back Rg3 we miss you so much  




 Honestly how are we going to do anything on offense, I see many 3 and outs in our future.
