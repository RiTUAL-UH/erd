Alone, with friends, family, parents, asshole roommate. Why? How do you like it?  Etc. 





















































































































































































































































































































 Welcome everyone to GTSIM. It has been just over two weeks since I started this sub and it has grown rapidly. We have 996 subscribers as this is posted and I expect it to pass 1K by the time most of you read this. 

First of all, I want to thank all of you for upvoting and subscribing. There isnt much interaction in terms of comments and submissions, but that will change soon as we grow. Most of the posts are mine, and I am fine providing content while this sub grows. If you guys think I am submitting too much or not enough,  let me know. 

Secondly,  I want to thank /u/dontgive1011 for his css contributions. If you guys have any feedback on the look of the sub, send a modmail or post on this thread. 

Lastly, please start contributing more content. Even if its just a picture you see on another sub or website and think "thats a gtsim shot," feel free to xpost it here. And if you find a discussion out in the front page subs where this sub is relevant, name drop it, even as a joke. It seriously helps. For example, many new users hear about /r/gonewild from someone making a joke about it on a default sub. Try dropping those hints but with /r/gtsim if it seems relevant.

Together we can grow this sub.

I'm still a new mod and I am learning so if you have any concerns,  advice, suggestions, hate, or love, let me know. Even if it is just to let me know about a typo on the sidebar or something. 

Thanks, test_subject2027. 






















































 This happened two years ago. We were having a bbq before a game and he prepared some veggie burgers and I made some meat burgers. He mushed his veggie burgers up real good and it actually looked like meat after we cooked them. We put the leftovers in the fridge and went to the game. 

When we got back I was a little bit drunk and was hungry so I opened the fridge and grabbed what I thought was the left over meat burgers. 

It was a mis steak.
