 Silly SoSo, Leanns amish. She doesnt know what a walmart is, lol. 




 I know right. We all love to hate Penn, but after this season, damn that girl is messed up! I used to think Morello was one of the normal ones, but we learn last season just how crazy she is. 




 Everything about this makes my jaw drop. You are..... Wow! 




 I think it was just supposed to be playful. 




 I like how SoSo goes from being an annoying character, to one of the most sympathized characters on the show. 




 "You were so hot before you were a cunt." 




 Wow, you're hot! I love your hips :)

 Not sure who she is, but that picture has been around for a long time. She may be a nobody.

 Now keep in mind, I don't know any Japanese. I know I can just go to Google, but I want to check with a native speaker because its for a tattoo. Basically, its a series of tattoos based on movies and games that, growing up, captivated and inspired my imagination. Simply I want to get the words "Never Stop Dreaming," in Hylian, and the era of [Hylian](https://i.imgur.com/Z05eact.jpg) I want to use is based off of Japanese.  So if anybody can translate it for me, and also transliterate it to the Latin alphabet. As is my key. I would be eternally grateful.  




 [This](http://imgur.com/Z05eact) is the reference chart I went by
 




 Whichever one proposes first. 









 Im in love with your smile :) 




 You are very welcome indeed :) 




 I want you so bad right now! 




 I need to go hiking
