 The Shabazz hangover. 




 Sweet 16 game, but basically haha. When that game started I was the only one at my house watching. By the time it ended there were 15 people there shouting at the TV 




 Only reason I like this right now is because I want Davidson in. VCU hopefully you guys figure it out in the next week and a half 




 Yesss it's a beautiful thing. Our finals week was always the first week of the tournament...which sounds awful. But then take into consideration that I never had a final later than Tuesday afternoon for those quarters = I'm free all week to watch all the games, plus Spring Break the week after. It was pretty much perfect haha 




 Agree it's worth reading, it's just way easier to find the scores for the bubble teams if they use a button on the scores page. 




 Jeez. Does Nantz realize no one likes him anyway? 




 Look a bit down the thread, it's been discussed 




 You're a champ. I just graduated, I remember balancing finals and March (we were on quarter system). Just think of all the wonderful basketball that awaits when you get through em 




 I see why it's done though. Reward the best teams in the regular season, make it mean more. I'd argue that has at least something to do with why the Horizon has made so much noise in the Big Dance recently. 




 Damn that's a tease. Hope he's alright and that he gets to play next week. 




 He cried? I thought he just daydreamed for a bit 




 bahahaha best manifest destiny joke ever 




 LOL YOU ALL LIVE THERE IT'S 77 DEGREES IN SAN DIEGO TODAY 




 SHE IS A SAINT, YOU HEAR ME, A SAINT 




 Gotcha. What does he use to weight it? 




 Best thing about it is we'll get to find out! I love TJ for you guys though, and Stanley Johnson is the truth, he went to high school near me. I don't wish you bad luck at all 




 I guess I don't understand this as well as I'd like. How does he adjust it exactly if you don't mind me asking? 




 Did anyone see Sacred Heart-Bryant? Double OT, huge shots back and forth. ITS MARCH AND IM SO EXCITED 




 I think Mercer left?

Yeah they went to the SoCon 




 Just a feeling I have. Really am not that high on them this year. No flow offensively. 




 Bill Walton is amazing, no idea what you're talking about

 




 I'm pretty sure the CIT is what you have to pay to play in. They even have a fancy sales-y brochure. http://collegeinsider.com/CIT2015/ 




 Oh totally. I mostly threw that in there to praise the job Archie Miller has done at Dayton. He's had a phenomenal stretch there the past 2 seasons, and he should be getting more hype for COTY awards. 




 This sounds so fun. 




 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXe-zJDZGIE) 




 Bitch he's Frank Mason 




 No one in the Pac 12 makes it out of the first weekend. 




 Teams would still be unlikely to do it, given that taking a spot in an empty game means someone seeded lower than you is guaranteed to play you.

And in the cases that it does happen, it would be exciting as hell. And if you really deserve the higher seed, go beat them anyway. 




 This makes me feel like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHtlnWNkma8 




 "Who would've thought having 0 capable players over 6'7" would turn out poorly in D1 college basketball?"

Survey says: http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/roster/_/id/2168/dayton-flyers 




 He's referring to the power-conference/his own mindset towards mid-majors. 




 http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000427085/article/larry-foote-jim-harbaugh-isnt-leaving-nfl-for-michigan

Was talked about more than a month in advance. As soon as it became clear he might not be coaching the 49ers, Michigan was discussed as a possible destination.

Anyway, this is a college basketball thread. I'd love to see Stevens back in college, it just ain't happening in the near future. 




 Except everyone knew that there was a good chance Harbaugh would go to Michigan. 




 I love that your bracket seeds small conference winners over a lot of the at-large teams. To me, this is how it should be, because a lot of those teams deserve to be given that respect. 




 But not on the list of games for each team, where he provides the number of possessions the game had.  




 Well actually..http://kenpom.com/blog/index.php/weblog/entry/the_pre-season_ap_poll_is_great 




 The more I think about it the more I feel that Nantz isn't gonna let Raftery talk and I'll hate Nantz even more. 




 I'm so torn by this.

Raff finally getting to do a Final Four will be awesome. Splitting up him and Verne makes me wanna cry. 




 Flashbacks to Dayton-Ohio State last year. Which was also fun as hell. 




 Wofford's no joke 




 I read this to the rhythm of the Rock Chalk chant and it made me giggle at work. 




 Lol you're very much on the bubble.

EDIT: totally thought that was IU flair. 




 Can Indiana fans stop with the Brad Stevens wishing? It's not gonna happen. 




 I'm rooting for Albany because I remember them being in the game against Florida last year with 5 minutes to go. 




 It has been for the past 5 minutes 




 He does that every game, it's comical 




 That was a textbook finish in transition to ward off the shot blockers. We're cookin here 




 Mostly laugh. 




 lol Stevens is not coming. Put that one to bed. 




 Thing is he really doesn't care about his skillset. Question is will someone pay him (read: take him in the 1st round).

Doesn't look like it right now that's for sure 




 Is that not every game? 




 Is Mosquera-Perea staying though? 




 Fuuuun. At least we get to laugh watching him coach. 




 It's games like this that make me wish I paid for cable. 




 What's his contract situation? 




 The intensity of the Big Dance is there for the small conference tournaments, cuz they know they're basically in the Dance already at that point: it's win or go home. 




 Well, you do get the tournament at home 




 Am I the only one who gets almost more excited for the small conference tournaments?

At least I trick myself into thinking that every year and then the Big Dance starts and I watch 16 games in a day and I spend the rest of the day screaming about how oh so wrong I was. 




 I love your team and Tony Bennett by the way. I'm just saying, you don't get much credit for adjusting to something you knew was coming. 




 What about Syracuse is tricky? Did you guys not know they'd come out running the same defense they've run for almost 40 years? 




 That's a generous interpretation 




 Don't get too dizzy spinning that hard. 




 I mean if you like being salty. 




 Score 2 points in 13 minutes? 




 Oh, SDSU too. 




 Point taken. You know your schedule better than I do, what quality teams have you played that are low-tempo this year? I can think of Utah and Gonzaga. Which to be fair, Gonzaga took you guys to OT at McKale where no one wins, and Utah I think is a little overrated.

I mean, that's one way to look at the strategy of a low-tempo offense. The more positive spin is that you're working to get the best possible shot and you're willing to let the shot clock run down to get that shot, working to get the little inefficiencies to stack up in your favor over the course of a possession through ball movement, cuts, and screens. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle of those two viewpoints. 




 I know it's not my team, but it's gotta be pretty hard to stay angry at Kemba and Shabazz. 




 Right, that's exactly what I mean. A team that's comfortable playing at a low-tempo offensively will be less dissuaded by Arizona slowing them down, especially if that team is still efficient offensively, like Northern Iowa is.

Agree with you about Stanley Johnson though. You need him going. Entirely different team based on how he's playing. 




 At best they show an ability to go high tempo if the game calls for it. Their Tempo numbers on KenPom right now are propped up by their games with Oregon and games against bad teams. 




 Obviously a lot of 1 and 2 seeds are gonna be picked. They're supposed to be the best teams. But there's years where they get picked, idk, 75% of the time and years where they get picked 90% of the time. I'd love to see the difference. 




 **Life Itself, by Roger Ebert**

Love Roger's ability to capture small perfect moments. And he's intelligent without pretension. I'll finish this one quickly I think.

**Six Rivers, by Peter Coates**

Super interesting history of six influential rivers around the world. It's slow reading, and designed to tell stories that are river-centric rather than anthropocentric, giving the river agency, that kinda thing. It's interesting stuff. I like filling in my ecological knowledge like this, and I've always liked bodies of water. 




 I'd love to see a compilation of expert picks going into the 08 tournament and compare how often those 1 seeds were picked to go to the Final Four compared to the aggregate from other years, but I'm not sure such a database exists. 




 Yeah, that's why it's not as much of a knife in the resum to me haha. That's exactly what I'm saying. 




 Yes for Utah, I'd say for Arkansas it's probably got more to do with no one is getting penalized for losing at Rupp at this point. 




 VCU's still good though, Dayton's just underrated right now. Archie Miller is doing a hell of a job. Wouldn't be surprised at all to see them in the second weekend if they get the right matchups.

Anyway. Teams with multiple bigs of a caliber that could give Okafor problems are few and far between, and most of them are on this list of 7 haha. 




 I get that, I've followed college hoops since I was a kid. But I've never looked at the top group of teams and felt like they were as separate from the pack as they are this year.

That being said, it's a single-elimination tournament played by 18-22 year olds. Anything can happen 




 The upside is there. Just not convinced, personally. Better shot than my alma mater! 




 Gotcha, better than a lot of people dismissing em out of hand!

Hard to judge the Waves against Gonzaga because they just don't have the size to matchup effectively. They got killed in both matchups by Wiltjer (6'10") and Sabonis (6'10"). And those losses were by a combined 10 points.

I don't wanna say they're excusable losses for BYU, just that Pepperdine is a lot better than most sub-100 teams. 




 Thing is, Duke also plays at a fast tempo and is used to riding their horses for heavy minutes at that pace. West Virginia and VCU don't score enough to keep up with Duke unless they shoot the lights out of the ball, which is always the great equalizer of the NCAA Tournament (see: Norfolk State-Mizzou. God that game still blows my mind)

If Duke loses to someone outside this group, it's gonna be because they just didn't play defense. All of their losses are that way. 




 The thing about these teams is that it wouldn't surprise me at all if all 7 of them made the Elite 8. There are no real matchup nightmares for any of these teams outside this group, because they're all damn good teams.

I guess I'd say Arizona doesn't want to face another low-tempo team who's big enough to match up with them but also efficient on offense. Both the MVC teams come to mind. 




 That's a fair enough point haha. It's also probably unfair to assume that if you were in the Final Four you guys would still look like you have lately.  




 Say what you want about him, the man makes a great drinking game if he's calling a matchup you don't care (that much) about.

1. Take a drink every time he disagrees with a call.
2. Take 2 drinks every time he says something is "ridiculous".
3. Take 3 drinks every time he brings up the NCAA.
4. Finish your drink every time he proposes a rule change.


Seriously though I like Bilas for the reasons that have been laid out here already. The man knows hoops and is refreshingly free from a lot of the media narratives about teams. Don't always agree with him, but always want to hear what he has to say. 




 Pepperdine is underrated. Definitely not there yet, but the building blocks are there. Have you actually seen them play? 




 I hate the Seattle pod in the East. Northern Iowa and Butler, two smaller schools who could legitimately make a regional final if things broke the right way? And two of the more dangerous mid-major teams in the country in Valpo and Murray State?

FUCK YOU SAME POD.

Seriously all 4 of those teams could win a game in the tournament, if not two or three. I know it's all done on bracketing principles but I'd be so bummed if that was a real pod in two weeks. 




 Except you wouldn't be the favorite on Monday. You'd be the team people were surprised was there. 




 Wofford yes. Baylor is playing great basketball right now, and really have flown under the radar all year. Pretty much the only reason people look at them like an upset candidate is Scott Drew, which is lazy thinking. He's been proving he's not a joke for awhile now. 




 https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/haithitrain.gif?w=694 




 Kind of an aside, but the Rays are building our old bullpen out in Tampa haha. Jepsen is obviously out there, but they signed Frieri and Kohn too.

Obviously now that Zobrist is in Oakland they look a lot better though, which is frustratingly predictable. 




 Honestly Chuck feels lazy now. It's kind of sad. Tried reading Damned and it just didn't do shit for me. 




 Only thing about Goodreads is that Amazon bought it not too long ago, and the recommendations are now generated off of that platform. So you'll get basically what Amazon thinks you'll like. Other than that, Goodreads is good stuff. 




 Cowart has been done for a while now in the eyes of the organization. Kubitza had a .405 OBP at AA last year too. And that's with a high strikeout rate apparently. This is the guy we're looking at as our 2016 3B. 




 Either that or Narcissus and Goldmund 
























 Came here to say the food, was not disappointed


Also people like the riddle/adventure/ancient legend combo that's present in a lot of the books, as well as the idea of cute talking animals 




 Also Jay Wright has done an amazing job this year, but I really feel like Chris Holtmann deserved Coach of the Year. 




 The way people are talking in here it's like Arcidiacono turned into Aaron Craft 




 Halley's Comet appearances 




 I agree, take an upvote. I'm just saying it sucks, and they're a good basketball team. It's a shitty situation when a team like Murray State gets 1 chance to prove they're worthy, and a team like nameamajorconferencebubbleteam gets 10.  




 It's not the analysis, it's the spirit of it. He's right. 




 I just said I don't think they deserve an at-large. I said I think they're a good basketball team. Which they are. 




 In November. With injuries.

Have you seen them play this year? 




 I think I'm being downvoted for things said elsewhere, not here. Which is funny but whatever.

Well, best of luck to you guys! Would've been cool to see what you could've done with a full year of Rice 




 That joke made me spittake at my desk. The Limewire thing hahahaha 




 Russian Roulette 




 Well that's your shot right there 




 Said it below, don't have a team. So at least you've got that going for you, my school has no chance and will never have a chance at the tournament 




 I'd flair up if I had a team! I'm just a college hoops fan, I went to UCSD, whose men's bball program is bad even for D2.

You guys have got a shot. How do you feel about Groce?

And I think that's debatable, Murray State is legit man. Once they got their full roster in place they started on that tear. That's not to say they'd be any better necessarily, I just don't think it's cut and dried. 




 Look, I don't think most people in here think Murray State's resume should get them in. I don't think anyone will have complaints if they don't get in.

Where it's bothering me is people acting like they're not a good basketball team. If you don't think this team is good, you either haven't seen them play, or have an axe to grind with them/mid-majors in general.  




 Hahah not at all, it's just a reddit thread. I'm more stoked it happened, but thanks for the offer! 




 The NBAPA are the ones blocking the age limit from going up. It's an owner thing. 




 Holy shit we came up with that at the same time. Take an upvote 




 Things you can say about the tournament bubble, but not your girlfriend 




 Lol it means Illinois fans are scared they won't get in and are taking that angst out by shitting on a truly exciting mid-major team who got beat by Belmont playing a great, great game in the OVC title game. 




 How'd that work out for ya? 




 The only people who hate you are the ones who are afraid you're gonna take their bid away. 




 I've never seen that GIF of Crean adjusting his pants in the comments, and it was pure gold 




 Spoken like a true fan of a truly underwhelming bubble team 




 That's the impression I've gotten from a distance too. It's just weird, I figured he'd be a solid head coach. 




 Not even begrudging respect? :P 




 Kinda surprised Snaer didn't get thrown in until now, dude was amazing. 




 Yeah I remember, Robbie Hummel was one of my favorite players. That team was forreal.

I didn't realize Etwaun had stuck in the NBA though, thought he got bounced. Then my roommate was watching the Thunder-Bulls game and I saw him hit a game-winner. Made my day haha, I was so pleasantly surprised. 




 I got a chance to go to the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 in Anaheim last year. Even as a person with no vested rooting interest, I was captivated. So worth it. You should go if you have the chance. 




 I feel like the ACL gods owe you guys a couple. 




 Me too! As always, it'll be fun as hell no matter what!

Hey just curious, as an Alabama fan, how do you feel about Anthony Grant's coaching job? 




 Fair enough for last year.

I hope it goes without saying that last year is not this year, though. 




 Famous last words. 




 Nova has lost exactly twice. How often is this phenomenon happening in your opinion? 




 It won't happen in this climate because SDSU is much stronger than UCLA at the moment, and UCLA wants to be able to claim supremacy in California when recruiting.

Although Sean Miller runs California in actuality. 




 Honestly every time I've watched them (admittedly it's been the bigger games, many of which have been losses), I've thought they have no fight at all. It's seemed to me that when another team makes a run, it just drags on and on because Utah doesn't have the fight in them.

The one exception to this is Brandon Taylor. The only one consistently playing hard when they're losing. I wouldn't be surprised at all if they were about to get upset in the Round of 64 and Taylor put the whole team on his back for crunch time.  




 The 11-13 lines are so dangerous this year it's crazy 




 Better get through Boise. Team is legit. 




 Dasean Butler is so underrated. And the moment with Huggins at the Final Four literally brings tears to my eyes every time. 




 Juan Dixon got me into college hoops. Dude was awesome. 




 Not saying they can't do it, saying that the Sweet 16 at the very least is a tall order. When you say you don't expect to make it that far, but then that you expect to make it further than 75% of the teams in the tournament, it's a confusing contradiction haha.

I was lucky enough to be at both of the Arizona-SDSU games last year (I'm a UCSD alum haha, I live in the area), they were both fantastic atmospheres and fantastic games. 




 Which I understand. If Kansas is seeded higher than Wisconsin on the 1-68 true seed list, which is what my statement is predicated on and what I mean when I say "if they pass them", they'd get first crack at the Midwest geographically, which sends Wisconsin elsewhere. 




 Woah that's potentially interesting. The Waves have played you guys tough, it's Sabonis and Wiltjer that have killed them.

Veeeeerryyy interesting. 




 I giggled at that call. 

I'm mostly excited at the prospect of you guys getting in cuz the Paladins is a dope mascot. 




 I'm still just mystified at how his arms manage to look short on TV.

Good luck to you guys, I think you have backdoor second-weekend potential if you get the right matchup 




 Props to you for actually realizing it. I feel like so many Syracuse fans I've talked to don't even acknowledge that that game was close. 




 Syracuse-UNC Asheville a couple years back. Should've happened, refs took it away from the Bulldogs.

Southern took Gonzaga to the wire 2 years ago. Coastal Carolina was winning in the second half against Virginia last year. Albany hung with Florida last year.

I feel like people assume these games are always blowouts; a lot of them are, yeah, but many of them are not. It's a lot closer than we think. 




 That's pretty far 




 Putting my foot in my mouth. Watching him play his arms look so short. But apparently he's got the wingspan of a goddamn condor lol 




 Well if Kansas passes Wisconsin on the two line it's possible. So if Wisconsin loses in the B1G tournament to someone bad and Kansas wins the Big 12, there's a chaaaaance. But a small one. 




 Yeah this is just not true 




 Anya is nowhere near long enough to be effective against UK unless they just get bullied. Which I doubt happens. 




 First to 90 wins! 




 VCU is entirely different without Briante Weber. 




 I've been making the argument that you guys have no chance.


But hell if I don't have hope you guys get in anyway 




 Well it is Bleacher Report. 




 Man Robbie Hummel was the best. 




 You guys expect to lose? Damn.  




 That's fair enough. I've seen a lot of reactions all over the place, guess that's what happens when you have a massive fan base. Northwestern is definitely a trap game too, they're a decent squad. 




 Shiiit I didn't mean to be a douche. My bad. 




 Curious. Are there Indiana fans who are still confident about tournament chances?

EDIT: I'm a douche sometimes. 




 Should've missed the first one too 




 His reactions are the best 




 It's been awesome to see them get on this weird little mini-roll. 

That being said, don't really want them to steal a bid from Green Bay and/or Valpo. 




 Big South was crazy yesterday, so much fun watching all the ends of the games at work 




 It's the same reason they don't have a tournament, so it doesn't fuck up their school schedules. But then one of them makes the big dance and fucks it up anyway 




 3, 4, 5, 7 for me. 2 was my next team out. 




 Grade inflation abounds, this is just one of the more comical examples. 




 With Dez its worth it tho 




 9th seeded Longwood* 




 Totally agree with what you're saying functionally; we should have clear path foul rules. Just pointing out that layups and dunks, the likes of which clear path fouls are committed to prevent, are missed far more often at this level than at the professional level 




 I feel like for timeouts, they should be able to just take less with them to the last minute. Every time I see Roy Williams call 4 timeouts in the last minute of play I want to throw something at him. 




 If you have possession and you're sliding on the floor, it's almost always called a travel. It's considered moving your pivot foot (technically) 




 I agree with your larger point, but there are a significant number of layups and dunks that get missed in exactly this situation in college hoops haha. 




 Yeah it's supposed to be sub-100 RPI are bad losses. Yale's 69th right now. 




 Nahh you didn't shit the bed, Boatright and Shabazz just destroyed your backcourt. Little different.  




 Khaliff Wyatt was the truth in that game. You guys deserved to win 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_cat_bounce

Basically just means that even something that is sucking can see a small positive reversal after their huge fall before settling into newfound suckitude. 




 Hahaha dammmmmit.  




 And the first 1 seed of the conference tournaments goes down! It's in the air baby 




 Upset alert in the Big South! 1 seed Charleston Southern trails by 8 at the under 4 timeout 




 All good :) 




 No they're not. 




 [From the Conference Tournaments Day 4 Thread](http://www.yalebulldogs.com/sports/m-baskbl/2011-12/releases/20120125cbh295) 




 Oh yeah that ban was definitely only done when they realized they probably wouldn't make it anyway. 




 Honestly I think it depends what BYU does. If BYU only loses to Gonzaga in the WCC tournament, they have a good shot to get in the Big Dance, and both of Gonzaga's losses will be to tournament teams (1 on the road in OT to a fellow 2 seed). Hard to take that away.

And honestly, even if they lost in the WCC tournament it'd be hard to knock em off the 2 line. 




 Betting Boeheim doesn't stay through the sanctions. He's seemed bored and frustrated for awhile now. 




 The Top 25 was more as a recognition of a perfect conference record and not having lost in a really long time, than having actually earned their way into the polls.

I wish there was room for an at-large like Murray State, but the way selection works, pretty much every bubble team would have to take an awful loss in the conference tournaments to even think about it. 




 I just started a new job and I'm slightly worried about my performance in the next few weeks. 




 I honestly don't know how much you can read into this one though. Once the blitz was on, it was on. This game was only contested for like 10 minutes, and the last 30 were just playing out the conclusion that was already written.

Davidson deserved to win, and win big, but VCU is better than this, even in the last three games, even without Briante. IMO.


That being said you could dead cat bounce through your next 2 games and get smoked in the tournament. Who knows. 




 Sadly nope. No beef to the resume at all 




 Yes yes so much yes 
























 The Big East had a couple teams overseeded, yes. There is no way Dayton was making it to the 6 line. Best case scenario was a 7. 

I'm not saying Xavier deserves their 6 (they don't), I'm saying Dayton wasn't in play for the 6. 




 You should be stoked, it's the coolest thing ever. I went for the first time last year and I had sky-high expectations, and it shattered them 




 Which would be one of the greatest things of all time, cuz he'd have approximately 97 points 




 It's a lot of losses for a 6 seed. 




 Take it up with UCLA and Indiana, not the Big East 




 They're like the 6th best team in the region, maybe. 




 Enjoy the Madness! 




 Fair enough! You guys have a great team, I just think Kentucky is the worst possible matchup for you (lol, as if they aren't for everyone)

I loooove Jerian Grant, one of my favorite players. I have him taking you guys to the Elite 8, he's just so fun to watch 




 I like him better than Haws. Although Haws is obviously still awesome. 




 Depends how big the pool is. If it's 50 people, this is a great strategy. If you're playing against hundreds, you'll probably have to get almost everything right to win this way. 




 EWU's not terrible. You guys are just getting labeled as March underachievers, and are therefore a sexy upset pick. 




 I'd say you have to get insanely lucky and have nearly a perfect bracket, or pick someone other than Kentucky to win the national title and hope it goes down that way. 




 Notre Dame only plays one player who's above 6'5", and they have a short bench. It's gonna be really hard for them to beat Kentucky. 




 Haws is good, he's not the best guard in the country. Maybe top 10. 




 I've got Northern Iowa. The game is gonna turn on if Lousiville is able to get out and run, cuz they're not gonna have a good time in the halfcourt. 




 FWIW, WVU has said Staten and Browne are going to play. 




 This is my diciest pick. I have a hunch about Wofford, is all it really is. I think they'll be able to slow the game down and Arkansas will get frustrated. Arkansas has the talent of a top 10 team. The reason they aren't a top 10 team is because they struggle to put it together a lot of the time. If this game is close in the first half, I can see them starting to crack.

This is, admittedly, my least defensible pick. 




 They outscored the league by that much because the league was not very good this year, at all.

The wins were by an average of 24.6 points because they weren't playing good teams haha. The best win of them was Stanford, who just straight gave up in the second half. I get you're a Pac 12 fan, but Utah is vulnerable here. Could they win this game, then go beat Duke in the Sweet 16? Hell yeah, they're talented enough to. But they're slumping right now, and they're vulnerable. 




 Don't trust SDSU. Seen them play a couple times this year, don't think they can score enough. Obekpa being out does make it interesting, but I feel like St John's will win. But that's the beauty of the tournament, who the hell am I? 




 Duke has a significant size advantage with Okafor against you. 1 of 5 guys.

If you play Kentucky, they'll have a significant size advantage over you at all 5 positions. 




 And the 162nd ranked offense in terms of efficiency. It's not good enough to beat Duke unless Duke looks disinterested (which has happened a couple times this year).

It's not impossible, just unlikely 




 There's a certain amount of this here too:

http://dc243.4shared.com/img/0-YPtbQE/s7/13eee3b8430/introduce_a_little_anarchy 




 SF Austin has the best chance. Buffalo has a solid shot at pulling one, and are well-coached. Wofford is a veteran team that a lot of experts like, but the metrics hate. Wyoming has by far the hardest matchup; Northern Iowa is a better version of themselves. 




 I heard they lost them somewhere around Heartbreak City. 




 Idk about that. Bennett is a great coach. I think Michigan State will win, but saying Bennett isn't a good coach is just foolishness 




 Iowa State. 




 Yeah forgot to throw that in there hahaha. Would truly be a bold statement if I meant the field. 




 UNC also happened to put a couple of those close games in the win column, including victories over Virginia and Louisville in the past week. 




 A good point. Wofford is an incredibly low-tempo team, however, so 67 PPG is not bad in that regard. Call this one a hunch; I just have a feeling Arkansas will get flustered. They have a tendency to do that.

I do think Arkansas is a really good team, capable of doing damage. Just think Wofford will get em. 




 That's why I can't wait! Gonna be an awesome 3 weeks 




 You beat them at home. You have 4 road wins all year, the best of which is probably Northwestern. Purdue has a road win at Indiana and a neutral site win over BYU. They do have bad losses, but they happened awhile ago, when the team was still struggling to put it together. I think them being 1 seed line higher is totally justified. 




 Soooo....you split with them. Congrats? You have 1 top 50 win, they have 4. That's significant. 




 *in the region 




 Massively underrated in the way people are talking about them. I think they got the seed they deserved. And they were ahead of Wisconsin btw, they're only behind Kentucky. 




 Yes. You answered your own question. If you're the weakest 2 seed, then yes, I would like you as my 2. 




 Based on your resume, a 10 is pretty accurate. You guys have certainly looked better than that at times though. 




 The edge I think is Gonzaga's height. Otherwise they're actually pretty similar teams. But a lot of people don't believe in Gonzaga in March. 




 Notre Dame only has one rotation player above 6'5" (Zach Auguste), and he struggles with foul trouble. 




 If Justin Jackson shoots 4/5 from three like he did against Virginia, UNC can beat anyone in the field. Anyone. That performance blew my mind. 




 To me, it's either this or SFA/EWU that has the most likely 12/13 second-round matchup. 




 Not even a little bit. I'd wager that most people are picking Texas, and 8/9 games are a coin flip, statistically. 




 For the record, I like you guys in this match-up. My post was just meant to be a couple quick-hitters about why people think they could do it.

Devin Williams is a bad man, and underrated as shit. 




 Losing Obekpa is big, but SDSU just cannot score. Like at all. Hard for me to pick them over the Johnnies, even without Obekpa. 




  They may not have had the resume to deserve their tourney bid, but they have the talent to win some games.

This is exactly how I feel about UCLA haha. The annoying thing about it is that when they win a game or two, the story will be about how everyone doubted them. No. No one doubts your talent. We just think you didn't earn your spot. 




 Oh absolutely. That's why these two are 8 and 9 and not, say, in the mix for a top 4 seed. 




 Good luck! Enjoy the Madness :) 




 Thanks! I love me some college hoops haha, and I follow it all year. This is like Christmas for me.

Oh I love Arkansas, also just have a gut feeling about Wofford haha. I also think they have a tendency to get a little out of control, and that can hurt them if they find the game close and Wofford hits some shots.

I'd probably have taken Cincy over any other 8/9 seed, but Purdue is playing well right now, and I think Cincy is realllly gonna struggle to score. But they've had a fantastic year given everything they've gone through. 




 Buffalo takes care of the ball well, gave Kentucky a decent game, and plays with pace. They are well-coached, and have a legit star in Justin Moss. They're not scintillating offensively, but they're not bad at anything. 




 I'm rooting for it too! The world needs more Tyler Harvey.

Utah is slumping, and SFA is an incredible team. SFA is probably the most popular 12 over a 5 pick, and for good reason. SFA went to OT with Northern Iowa earlier in the year, and Northern Iowa is a team a lot of people think can make the Final Four. Utah has lost 4 of 7 coming into the tournament, and hasn't looked that good doing it. Delon Wright is really good for the Utes, but personally, I think we're gonna see Stephen F Austin take it.
 




 Not without rebounding extraordinarily well for a team their size. Gonna be incredibly difficult, and they really have no answer for Towns inside. If they shoot it well, they might. Otherwise, nope. 




 8/9 winners: Purdue, Oregon, LSU, St John's

5/12 winners: West Virginia, Wofford, Northern Iowa, Stephen F Austin

Wichita State. Indiana is trending downward and Wichita reeeeally wants the Kansas game.

UNC. Paige is finally starting to play well again. Meeks is getting healthy. If Justin Jackson can keep shooting the ball well, they're a threat to get to Indianapolis.

BYU if they win, Xavier if Ole Miss wins. Xavier is the most overseeded team in the field, and BYU is really good, and playing great ball right now.

Ohio State can win a game, but I'd be amazed if they beat Arizona in the Round of 32.

Davidson could make the second weekend if they catch Gonzaga on an off night, but it's hard to picture them beating Iowa State. That being said, the way they shoot the three, it's not impossible.

I think UCLA will get SMU. Norman Powell is really good, UCLA takes care of the ball, and SMU is turnover-prone. If UCLA stays out of foul trouble, they could do it.

This is the best Gonzaga team in a while. NDSU is good, but man will they have to have the game of their lives to pull this off, especially given the Zags size. That being said, a 15 seed beat a 2 seed just a few years ago by having the game of their lives (Norfolk State over Missouri).

Michigan State. They're peaking at the right time and Izzo knows his way around this month. Georgia isn't to be taken lightly, but the Spartans should be favored.

Providence, Dayton, and OU are all legit teams. Dayton will be playing at home. OU probably has the best team. Providence will have the best player in any game. All three are very well-coached. This is one of the best pods in the first two rounds. I have Providence, but none of these three is wrong (and hell, Albany might get OU in the first round)

I have Nova. They're really really strong. Northern Iowa is also awesome, and a veteran group to boot. Louisville would be dicey. They're not playing that well right now. The 8/9 winner will have a decent shot at getting Villanova, but to me, Jay Wright will coach circles around Johnny Jones or (EDIT: Mark Gottfried, not Steve Lavin. Silly me). Not to mention they're really really good.
 




 Villanova is massively underrated IMO. That being said, I also think they got the hardest 8/9 draw of the 1 seeds. LSU and NC State both have the talent to beat anyone in the tournament. 




 EWU over Georgetown is tempting. EWU has the number 1 scorer in the country in Tyler Harvey, and shoot the 3 well, which is a great formula for an upset. Georgetown is a team a lot of people see as overseeded, and they have a psychological hurdle to overcome in proving that they won't be undone by a low seed in the first weekend yet again.

That being said, EWU doesn't play a lick of defense and Georgetown's offense is actually pretty good. So it depends how likely you think EWU is to get hot and outscore Georgetown. It's definitely not the most ridiculous upset pick, and it might be the most likely 13 over a 4. 




 4 percentage points? Are we gonna call that significant? 




 Best one of these for me was UConn winning it all in 2011. 




 Talent-wise and matchup-wise, they're probably the most equipped to beat Kentucky.

But Rick Barnes. 




 I'm hoping so bad for that SFA/Duke game. I think Duke would win but I think it would be amazing 




 Arizona has completely changed my mind in the past few weeks. They've looked really really good 




 SDSU to the Elite 8 is crazier than any of those haha. 




 Kentucky/Notre Dame
Wisconsin/Arizona
Villanova/Providence
Duke/Gonzaga 




 Not totally fair to say. Washington had their best player on the team still at that point (Upshaw), and were well on course to make the tournament with him on the team. 




 Why the Providence hate? Team is good. 




 Iowa is a 7, Iowa State is a 3. They can't play til the Sweet 16. 




 For what it's worth, that's also why Kansas keeps getting really high seeds. The committee rewards difficult schedules. 




 60 minutes? Damn that sure seems like asking a lot. 




 Texas isn't a bad loss, even right now.. 




 Yesss, I read Walden before I read Into the Wild, and I feel exactly the same way about it. Thoreau had some amazing truths to tell 




 No, no no no, no no no no no.

Seriously there's absolutely zero chance Kentucky isn't the number 1 overall seed unless the whole team gets declared ineligible. 




 It's just Duke/UVA is a matchup between two 1 seeds that went toe to toe the first time they played and Duke/UNC is the most popular matchup possible in any college game for ESPN. They just really don't want you to make it. 




 Reason being that you're the only team in the semis that would not create a delicious final for TV 




 That's wrong tho. You don't have to be stationary.

EDIT: These rules apply to a secondary defender. A primary defender can be giving ground and still draw a charge. 




 Into the Wild is a fascinating read. People got more than a little caught up in deciding who was right about Chris McCandless, but it's a fantastic story. 




 We were not all that far away from a Michigan-Penn State semifinal. Great effort by both teams, but the better teams won.

And man did DJ Newbill break my heart at the end. What a player. 




 This is EXACTLY how I've felt for the past year. Thanks for everything you do Mark. This, this right here? Made me cry. 




 Hammons has a smooth stroke at the line for a big 




 DON'T GOT NO TEAM CUZ MY SCHOOL IS SHITTY EVEN FOR D2 I JUST LOVE COLLEGE HOOPS CUZ I GREW UP WATCHING 




 Only thing in that sequence I thought was out of the ordinary was the quick timeout awarded. Everything else seemed fair to me. 




 Jeeeeeez eat your heart out La Salle. March is amazing but it can be brutal 




 Game was won and lost on those 50/50 balls down the stretch. Wisconsin got them and turned empty trips into points every time.

That said, Michigan played a hell of a game 




 Everyone always throws out hiring full-time officials. Yes, that would be ideal. It's also far easier to do for 30 teams, who can play a maximum of 15 games a night (which never happens), than it is to do for 351 teams in D1. Logistically that is a million times more difficult than a 30 team league like the NBA. 




 Every year we get at least one great dancing players GIF from college hoops. Who are the front runners this year, and who can surprise us in the tournament and take the title? 




 Holy shit I clicked on that and looked at the other scores from the day in the box above..Texas was still ranked 11. 




 They were better for 36 minutes of the game. Team is a combination of snakebit and Rick Barnes'd. 




 It's cuz he was about to say Longhorns lol 




 HEY UNC

MARCUS PAIGE'S BAGGY ASS UNIFORM MAKES HIM LOOK LIKE A GIRLFRIEND WHO SPENT THE NIGHT AND BORROWED YOUR CLOTHES 




 Really? You hung tough with an underrated team that you don't match up well with without your best player and you're mad?

Damn. 




 Man I love Devin Williams. Keep your head up Devin, you're gonna be a big part of next weekend for your team. 




 Jumala's saying these are counterexamples of "finishing sentence[s]" sucking. As in these last lines are all quite good. 




 Just the way the teams are playing right now, Indiana would likely be a much easier matchup. 




 You should be much more worried about BYU than Indiana haha 




 This is exactly how I feel.

"Well if I have one game on TV, one game on my laptop, and one game on my phone.." 




 I too love The Brothers Karamazov! Keep reading the Russians.
