 I wrote a paper on zebra stripes for my intro evolution course last year.  It was difficult to find studies on zebra stripes because everyone has just gone with the explanation someone came up with in ~~1890~~ 1867.

EDIT: Looked up the date - it was 1867, not 1890. 




 I'm an undergrad and do research in an ecology lab on my university's campus.  In my ecology courses, I learned about Optimal Foraging Theory (OFT) and even did some small experiments in those courses pertaining to OFT.  In my lab the other day, some of the professors were talking during our weekly lab meeting about behavior and one said that ecologists haven't used OFT to explain behavior in decades, ehoch surprised me since most of my courses devote so much time on the topic.  The professors in my lab are always busy and are out of the lab half the time, so I figured I'd ask other ecologically inclined people here!

Are there major flaws that make OFT a bad explanation for behavior?  




 Here are a [couple](http://www.care2.com/causes/wind-farms-and-eagle-deaths-the-dilemmas-of-green-energy.html) of [articles](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-impact-wind-farms-get-pass-eagle-deaths) about what /u/DonnieS1 is talking about.

I know that wind farms kill far fewer birds than other forms of energy production, but they should be held accountable if they commit the same federal offenses as the other guys.  If they aren't made to pay the fines though, I'd like to see wind farms that kill birds put money towards conservation of affected bird species (if they don't already do that). 




 I just got a friend request about 20 minutes ago from someone I didn't know, but whose name I had seen before but couldn't remember where. When I read your comment,  it dawned on me, and sure enough, this person's name appeared on my phone's caller ID when he tried to call me last week (I don't answer for names I don't recognize). That's really unnerving... 




 Taylor Swift's reaction looks eerily similar to [this](http://i.imgur.com/NMNqH.gif). 




 These headphones definitely make the vast majority of the songs I listen to sound glorious, but I've never listened to any other headphones so I can't say whether or not they're the best out there.  I would recommend them based on my experience and general stinginess though, at least until (or if) I come across another kind that I think sound better and are in the same price range. 




 I got myself the Audio Technica ATH-M50 a few months ago for about $100.  This is my first non-earbud listening apparatus and I'd definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a decent pair of headphones at a fair price, especially since I've spent $150 for Bose earbuds before.

 Dr. Ingrid Visser has [permission](http://www.orcaresearch.org/index.php/marine-mammals-regulations) to participate in these interactions according to the website of the research trust she [founded] (http://www.orcaresearch.org/index.php/research/our-team).  She's written an [autobiography] (http://www.amazon.com/Ingrid-N.-Visser/e/B003BWZFFO) and there's a BBC [documentary] (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0147dw3) about her research style, if you're interested!  Also, here's a BBC [interview] (https://soundcloud.com/orca-research-trust/bbc-swimming-with-whales) about what it is like to swim with killer whales, the New Zealand population of killer whales in general, and Dr. Visser's feelings concerning cetacean captivity. 




 Mmmhmm. 




 Last year, as I was walking down a campus street in the afternoon, a middle-aged couple approached me.  The man began to tell me this story about how his lady has been in the university hospital, so they needed money because their car was parked in the hospital garage and was also out of gas and they haven't eaten all day and needed food.  The lady even showed me a "hospital ID bracelet" she was wearing to prove she had just left the hospital.  I knew this story was BS, because they were in the academic core of the university which is about 10 blocks from the hospital and they both looked homeless.  I told them I was a broke college student, but they wouldn't take that for an answer.  The man kept adding to his story and was getting closer to me and the woman started to move to my side and was heading behind me.  Since there were 2 of them and 1 of me and the street was unusually deserted at the time, I gave them the change in my pocket and they immediately left.  I figured it was better to give them ~$1 in change and get out of there than to stay and potentially get robbed.

 What was it? 




 Are there any particularly fun/unique experiences you've had with your dog? 









 There was speculation among anti-captivity circles that this application had much greater implications for the import of wild-caught cetaceans to the U.S.  Had it been approved, some believed that it could open the door for the capture of Alaskan killer whales that ventured into Russian waters, which would be of great interest to SeaWorld in particular, as the genetic variation within their captive population is deplorably low. 









 Are these rubber-tipped sticks?  If they're not and the guy has decent chops he could probably do some damage to the treadmill. 




 Here are the links to the papers on [blue whales](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1765/20130657) and [beaked whales](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/9/4/20130223), respectively, sited by the article.

I'm surprised the authors of the beaked whale paper were able to get published with a sample size of two individuals, but since beaked whales are so rare, it was probably not feasible to use a larger sample size. 









 Congrats on the long term relationship! 

I've never met anyone from Ohio that is happy to be from here.  Either they already left and are glad they did or are planning to leave after whatever life milestone comes next (graduation, retirement, etc.).  The only problem is that it's like a miniature black hole of terrible that's nearly impossible to escape from. 




 I'm surprised Ohio hasn't shown up yet.  Do non-Ohioans not hate our state as much as we do?

We don't even have a real flag, we use bodies of water as directions (north is called "towards the lake" and south is called "towards the river"), and our unit for measuring time is "days until the next Ohio State University football game."  Oh yeah, and soybeans.  Soybeans.  Everywhere. 




 I was an idiot today and was playing with a power strip with a wet hand while the other was in an aquarium and I was standing in a pool of water.  I felt a buzz in my finger when I turned on the strip that I hadn't felt before when using it and realized I'd just been shocked.  That freaked me out because I could have potentially died and not even realized it. 




 I wrote the previous comment at work and guessed on the date.  In his 1867 book *Mimicry, and Other Protective Resemblances Among Animals* (and later, his 1879 paper published in *Science*), Alfred Russel Wallace suggested stripes evolved in order to provide camouflage from predators by allowing zebras to blend in with the surrounding area.
This particular hypothesis was refuted by Darwin and others since the stripes do not blend with the usual zebra habitat of short grasses, but the more recent adaptation is that the stripes confuse predators by making it difficult to single out an individual in the group.  However, zebras tend to live in small groups or are solitary, so this might not even be the case.

Some other hypotheses are that the stripes are for social benefits (sexual selection or communication), thermoregulation, and protection from parasites (tsetse flies in particular).  Darwin thought it might be for intrasexual selection and described an experiment in which a female zebra and a male wild ass are placed together and the female zebra would only let the wild ass mate with her when the researchers painted stripes him.

Personally, I think zebra stripes are least likely to be for predator avoidance, but that seems to be the one that has stuck in society's list of animal myths. 
























 It could definitely (and probably does) cause auditory hearing loss because their ears work very much like ours.  The sonar mechanism is a little more tricky.  I'm on mobile now and like I said earlier, I'm feeling particularly tired/lazy so I'm going to try to explain what I can remember about it (which isn't much).  Small cetaceans have an organ on the top of their head called a melon.  I can't recall what's in it, but it's either fluid-filled or fatty and it's highly malleable.  They use it to alter the high frequency sound waves they emit, which bounce off objects in the water.  They receive the returning waves through ~~hollows~~ special sound conducting tissues in their lower jaw, ~~which is either gas-filled or fluid-filled~~, and this amplifies it for them.  ~~I'm not sure off the top of my head if the sonar waves go from the jaw to the ears or if they have another avenue to the brain, but I'll definitely look it up when I get a chance in the next day or so.~~  The sound waves then travel to the inner ear.

So the loud music probably wouldn't damage the melon or jawbone to produce and receive the sonar, but it could affect the inner ear, which is used for auditory hearing as well ~~I'm not sure about the sonar processing pathway.  If it's the ears then it would, but I have a feeling it's not~~.  Echolocation seems to not be as important as auditory hearing though, which I was surprised to learn.  It seems even less important for captive cetaceans, since their environment never changes and is pretty free of obstacles. They probably learn quickly how to avoid running into the walls or bottom at night if it's too dark too see and don't need to use sonar much after that.

EDIT: [NOAA link](http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/cetaceans/cetaceaechol.php) that has good info! 




 Unfortunately, there's been a recent fad of having EDM concerts (or firework shows) at zoos and aquaria.  It's really bad for marine mammals in particular, because of their physiology and the construction of the pools that they are kept in.  Small cetaceans, such as dolphins, in particular have extremely sensitive hearing, so much so that they can even hunt fish solely through auditory sound, as opposed to using sight or echolocation (referenced in [this paper](http://www.econscience.org/val/pubs/orca_refs/barrett-lennard+96.pdf)).  The concrete tanks that cetaceans are kept in also act like giant satellite dishes, amplifying and reverberating any sound waves that enter the tanks (best link I could find is a [heavily anti-captivity blog](http://www.freewebs.com/let_toki_go_free/dolphinswim.htm), but this seems like common sense that bare walls cause echoes).  Also, sounds are naturally amplified by water ([Yahoo answers is the best source I can find quickly](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100517162204AAyO0TC), but again, it's common sense that the more dense a fluid, the more concentrated by sound).  Combine all these facts, and you have a terrible situation to be in if you're a cetacean.  It's also awful when you have people feed them things that they shouldn't eat.  Allegedly, captive dolphins are quick to eat just about anything, which could be a stereotypical behavior caused by the lack of stimulus in a captive environment or because they are kept hungry in order to get them to interact with zoo patrons.  I've read stories about people feeding captive dolphins paper, coins, and even lit cigarettes.  This is why I dislike people.

EDIT1: I can try to find links to supporting data later if anyone is interested.  It'd be more about the first half of what I said than the last half (since it's not like zoos and aquaria will let outside researchers study their animals to for the negative impacts captivity has on them).  Although I could find links for the second half, it would all be anecdotal.  It's late at night so I'm far to tired/lazy to do it now.

EDIT2: Links added.  Bonus [link](http://cetaceaninspiration.tumblr.com/post/33537138326/cetacean-hearing-music-in-shows-does-not-hurt) of a good Tumblr debate on the issue of noises affecting captive cetaceans.

TL;DR: Marine mammal captivity sucks. 









 After a hiatus and eventual retooling, Search the City is back and releasing a new album in about 3 weeks.  Much different sound than the previous line up (new singer, drummer, and bassist) but still great! 









 Yeah, if I had to get mauled by a mystery beast, I'd prefer to be completely covered at the time.  




 I think I would stop midstream if that happened to me.  Do you know if it ever tried to attack anyone? 




 Your sister does a great thing!  I'm glad that you and your sister have been able to help him so much.  I've only ever had small pets like fish and mice, but I'm readying a book on the study of animal personalities and it's made me think about many other animals, and mammals in particular, have sets of behaviors that can be as complex and unique as humans.  Those stories you shared were very heartwarming :) 




 I've seen dogs like him before but I don't know what the breed is called.  He's a great looking dog, though! 




 I've heard stories about camel spiders and such, but some unknown beast lurking around sounds much worse! 




 Awh :(  Hopefully the little guy headed back home after he saw you weren't able to give him any more attention! 




 That's really cool, actually!  Dogs seem to respond to high-stress situations much better than people do
