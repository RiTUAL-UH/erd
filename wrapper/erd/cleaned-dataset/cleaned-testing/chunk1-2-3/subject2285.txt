 I watched the movie after reading Emma's praise about the story.But i was really disappointed with the movie.A total disaster and waste of time. 




 Nah.Diesel is not a sword guy.He's all muscle.Looking forward to it. 




 Good film.Unique and excellent screenplay.Jake and Tony did a great job. 
























 Mirror, Mirror and Snow White and the Huntsman 




 It is a bit underrated movie although i think it deserves much more than that.I liked the movie very much.Brad Pitt,Casey Affleck did a great job.The directing was very good too.The concept of narrating the story was great. 




 After watching Part-1 my ideas on crime movies were never the same again.And no other crime movie can compete with it either. 
























 Totally agree with you on that. 




 I didn't say she praised the movie.I said she praised the script.I read that she said it was a wonderful script and she just had to act in it.
