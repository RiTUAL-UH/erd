 Have you ever seen his program ["Meeting of the Minds"?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNqkzDHkATY) 




 I notice how many more guest where on a one hour show back then as compared to now.  




 And without autotune or samples. 




 Very few performers today exhibit this level of showmanship.   









 This became a meme back then, we didn't know that's what there we're called back then though. 




 But a majority have no opinion.

 There is also one named Hamburg, smells better. 




 Source? Really? Math! If I give you one slice of pizza with 4 oz of meat and 4 oz of bread and I give you another one with 4 oz of meat, but 2 oz of bread, one of those slices would have a higher meat to bread ratio, wouldn't it? 




 Pound for pound, a slice of thin crust pizza would have a higher meat/bread ratio than a traditional slice. 




 So what are the chances that the Rapper and James Blake are roommates? 




 Skene's gland, also known as the paraurethral gland, found in females, is homologous to the prostate gland in males. However, anatomically, the uterus is in the same position as the prostate gland. In 2002 Skene's gland was officially renamed to female prostate by the Federative International Committee on Anatomical Terminology
 




 Bread has less fat than meat. 




 So, She saved the U.S. taxpayers several million dollars?  





























 She also blasted her fellow Republicans for failing to come to her aid 









 You should know about /r/otr.

And you've made a lot of nice post in the last couple of weeks. 




 I make widgets for the Acme Drone Company.

 Wow, that's almost as many as we have in Japan, give or take 40,000. 




 Couldn't you have said the same thing about the automobile a hundred years ago? Or the helicopter sixty years ago?  




 Are you arguing that because something can be used for something other than saving lives, it shouldn't be used? Would you say that about a drug or guns? 



















 Maybe you should write a bot that just responds to bots, accusing them of being bots?  









 How the hell can you be transgendered if haven't got genitals in the first place? 




  Does the fact a Rabbi and Cop were involved make it anything more than a slight bit more interesting to the average person?

The cop was formerly a chief of police. 




 A chief of police is the title typically given to the top official in the chain of command of a police department. 




 Not really sure why this was posted here.


Pillars of the community, in positions of authority, working together in secret to illegally victimize people? Isn't that the definition of a conspiracy?     




 Mr. Barron was a Harvard law professor, Mr. Obama was a constitutional law professor, Dr. Paul was an ophthalmologist. 




 Still haven't explained why it's "racist". 



















 The number next to your name is for link karma. It has nothing to do with how many links you have posted, it is the total amount of times that others Redditors have clicked the "Up" arrow to the left of your link. If one of your links has 5 upvotes, 5 more Redditors have "Liked" your post than have downvoted or "Unliked" it. Each subreddit has it's own rule rules about posting. The more karma you have, the less restrictions there will be on how much you can post, that's why redditors post cat pics and stuff, to build up cheap and easy karma. 




 GOP rep raises concerns over exercise free speech in Capitol 












































 The media have too much invested in the "Us versus Them" narrative. There will always be an opposition party, might not be the one we have now, but there are too many wedge issues for the U.S. to ever be a one party state. 














 You looked at 11 months worth of my posts after I made a comment on your post? How long did that take? 









 But this isn't about race. 




 Hundreds. 




 Nobody liked it when I posted either. And no millions will not show up, more like thousands. 









 Russia is poorer than almost every country in South America. 




 Really, He seemed so outgoing and self assured on Family Feud.   




 A Conservative oriented website using an add generator produced by an infamously liberal corporation as its primary funding source sounds like a bad business model. Maybe they should have used an add generator produced by a conservative corporation as its primary funding source. Are there any of those? And if not, why? 




 State Department Buying Massive Cache of Explosives, One World Net Daily Journalist Claims

Also, doesn't the State Department have a right to keep and bear arms? 




 Feltner voted for a previous Democratic president, Bill Clinton, but now says: "I will vote for anybody against Obama.

He doesn't even know that Obama's term isn't up and that when it is, he won't be eligible for reelection? 




 Good thing he's in Russia now, he won't see anything disturbing there. 



















 I guess somebody will be calling for an investigation to find out where Hillary was when it happened.  




 Look, you people have Conservapedia, why not just go there?  




 A) I just posted a link to a story, I'm not Chuck Hagel.

B) I haven't deleted anyones post, I'm not a Moderator.  



















 Isn't that's like asking "What the point in insurance if I have a job?"  




 One of the sure signs that you live in a dictatorship is when you announce where, and when, you intend to trespass on government controlled land, and invite the press to document it, and jack-all happens.  




 Remember how shocked they were that homeless people had cell phones? 




 The President would have to nominate a successor and then the Senate would have to confirm or reject that nominee, if rejected the President would have to name another nominee but the Standing Rules of the Senate allows one or more Senators to prevent a motion from reaching a vote on the Senate floor.
