 Lovin' the "TE-DDY!" Chants at TCF. Skol! 




 What each person thinks their spirit animal is. It's a light hearted way to learn about each other's personality. 




 I'm studying to be a PA as well. 6 months in, just passed Pharmacology. Great answer! Our faculty always scoffs at self diagnosis, but I had a buddy who saved his life by researching on line. I feel the patient knows their body better then I do, so it is definitely worth a listen. 




 Yup. 3 years, 4,000 comment karma, 2,000 link karma. Had to get rid of it because my username was not appropriate. 
























 Hey all, anyone know of a good simulator to practice with? Something that has a patient presentation and you need to gather history, perform an exam, give meds and the simulation will respond accordingly? 




 Sorry to butt in, but this is obvious.  




 Subtle. I like it.

 Haha, that was what I was hoping for. It would be a warning sign to anyone who knew some anatomy that it was all bull. 




 Sports medicine professional here. Emesis in football is actually more common then you think, but not at the professional level. Do you see the way his head jerks slightly right before emesis? It almost looks like a double take. This is known as the "Callaway" sign, it signifies emesis is likely about to occur. The anatomy goes like this: due to the strange squatting position and repeated supination and flexion of the dominant arm, the esophagus is repeatedly retracted into the fundal gastric region. This stimulates baroreceptrors in the pouch of douglas. Sort of like how tickling makes you laugh, it is completely idiological. But the reason this occurs to pros less often is they don't pull your leg. Sorry. All BS. Not a professional, I just know fancy words.
