 Hahahaha - there was talk of using Montgomery Clift or Farley Granger...

We just thought the "named after Alan Ladd" element was too good to pass up!  




 Thank you :) 


































 Actual film composition is all conjecture at this moment as we know absolutely nothing about:

a.) shared screen time.

b.) Lex's power suit (armani or armor)

I'm just talking looking at them side by side in the abstract.  Eisenberg is known for playing an introverted nerd type and Cavill is ripped - even if not to comic standards (much like the airbrushed standards women face).  

I'm just saying, in terms of spirit - they are quite opposite.   




 I kind of like this casting.  They can go a lot routes with this character - specifically in the contrasting looks between Superman and Lex.  Just physically, when you look at them, you know where their strengths lie. 

They can play off Lex's need to be adored - and maybe that jealousy of Superman plays into his working out and bulking up.  

I would suggest reading these to get a better look at their complex relationship:

 I think the Joker looks down on anyone who loves him.  














 Hey guys, 

I have to agree with apathy and uber in that I really enjoyed it, and found it moving on a number of levels.  

I have a different take about how it's an allegory on my site here:
