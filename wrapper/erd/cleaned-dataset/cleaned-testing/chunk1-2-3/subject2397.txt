 Are a combo of Bloodflood pt. 1 and Fitzpleasure? I just listened to it for the first time and thought that was awesome 




 Owen libary is my favorite. 6th floor has a great view and usually empty, and the downstairs has the best computers.  Basement of Holland Terrell is also great. or if you like some distraction the first floor of  the CUB is pretty nice

I personally have been listening to Woodkid I think his tracks are awesome and has a great voice. 




 Why would there be a doorbell on a chemical plant to begin with? 




 That has been my thought. That was a huge parking lot. Not only that but it is right in front of Scott coman, like they can't even walk outside now type thing 









 Mustache man in the back wants it 




 "I traded it in for  a microphone"

"Yeah I can see that" 




 I'm not the biggest football expert but.. I'm afraid this is a little too true. I think momentum is important for us and Nevada is a school we should be able to beat. Of course if the WSU team that played Rutgers played Nevada I think we would've won. I do however think our home game schedule will be to our advantage since they're against some tough teams but home field advantage will be in our favor. Go Cougs! 




 Not just landfills but the middle of the Pacific Ocean 




 I'm rewatching the show and I just finished Season 7. Over the seasons I think he is one of the most diverse characters  and although it doesn't always make sense I love that he switches persona's each season especially after he gets back from corporate. 




 Don't tell Ayn Rand 




 That's awesome! Now if only the buses were even a little bit on time 



















 I've seen the show too many times so I tend to get seasons mixed up but I'd say for most the show Marshal is a corporate lawyer which according to the show/real life makes a lot of money. Plus Lily has a teacher's salary albeit not great but still. So why are they always seemingly broke? Even if Lily spent her entire paychecks on clothes I don't see how they'd be tight on money, and Marshal's school debt would be bad but I doubt he doesn't have a plan on it. Any thoughts?

 I got a tent last summer and haven't been able to use it and don't have a car. I'm wondering if there's any secret spots in Pullman that you could set up a tent for the night without anyone noticing. Anyone know of spots?

 Oh right ok. At the moment I'm nervous about a lot of stuff ha 




 What year in med school are you? I'm hopefully going to pharmacy school next year. Just waitin on that email to come 




 I just hate how throughout the series we're led to believe that the whole gang is always together. Uncle barney and Aunt Robin are always prevalent. But no turns out they all pretty much go their separate ways.

Barney's part too. He just becomes a total loser at the end. Perfect month? I'm sorry but no. And then he has a kid with a random ho whom we know nothing about and everything is fine and dandy. Why have we never heard about this kid before. Wouldn't that kid be Ted's kid's friend? Total shortcut in writing 




 I thought the way it was written was classic himym, definitely not the top 5 worst episodes 




 Anything autism related. I don't even know why that gets discussed on Reddit 




 You may need to explain this further 









 Since when is all of france the size of NYC? 




 That's how I got here. I remember back in 8th grade I had a Coach Z shirt. So awesome 




 I have an actual cat, is that cool? Anyone? 




 That's true but at least Barney doesn't introduce the girls to them. I mean I don't break up with someone then show off the latest person I'm seeing to my ex 




 Ok, thank you for actually coming up with a reason. Of course I wouldn't discriminate against other races. I don't think there's a country in the world where every single person is unattractive  




 Are you trying to make me sad? 




 /r/subredditsarehashbrowns 




 I don't get your logic why is it necessary to be attracted to every single Asian group? I mean if you think Italian girls are hot does that mean you have to love Polish girls too just because they're all European? 




 My parents are putting me through college and I thank them all the time. I mean it literally wouldn't be possible otherwise. Working full time at the same time as college wouldn't be enough, and that would be darn near impossible anyways 




 As a college student I can say there's a direct correlation between time spent studying and grades on tests. However I don't really get hw I just have to memorize tons of stuff 




 How is thinking chinese girls are cute racist? And no one asked you to reply to my post

 I think it's stupid in most cases. Like at a bar when they pour a beer and hand it to me. I mean really what effort didd that take?

Now for a barber I'm all for it cuz they could totally ruin your life.

 Mandarin and Spanish for usefulness.

 Sports. Skipping class to go on a bus ride for cross country was the best 




 Good thing I'm lipid soluble 




 "Look is this gonna happen or what?" 









 The last episode just really made me bitter towards Robin. I feel like she was the reason the divorce happened. Sounded like she only cared about her career and never spent time with Barney 




 I asked this too awhile back. General consensus was that was just Barney joking 




 And now you're into human sandwhiches 20 years later?

 Ahh yes, the 500 point turn

 I always wanted Ted or Barney (either one really) to marry Wendy the Waitress. She's one of the best looking girls on the show and looks fun. Maybe I just want to marry her :( 




 This may sound weird but I've always thought smoking in old movies or like this picture looked cool. I don't smoke but damn OP's dad just makes it look awesome. Just that relaxed look

 If you think about it most of the crime in those places isn't even reported in the news. So more than likely they're worse 




 You gotta love crab

 Yes in fact these 2 motions are analogous to said fingerbanging 




 Did anything cool happen or did you just mail them back? 




 I can just hear those ribs cracking 




 Chucks/vansheels. always 




 My cross country team was an absolute joke. We did far worse stuff than wave, like skipping across the finish line. It was fun though 




 Yep, had this happen to me once. The dude came to my car, opened my door, and yelled at me.  To OP, that is a horrible situation and I hope the guy gets thrown in jail for a good long while 




 Chad's bad 




 I definitely agree. Although I did love Archer Vice. Glad it's goin back to the original format tho 




 I thought it went well. They were pretty casual and only asked about 5 or so questions that were all what I'm sure any pre-pharm person would have answers to.  Then they let me ask questions; I had a notebook of them written down so I just asked away. And they were all super nice 




 Did everyone back then just have thick black hair with perfect hairlines? 




 MC Escher that's actuallly a genius title for this. I'm still confused.. 




 Plus the timeline seems all screwed up. I watched Death Note in like 36 hours and I couldn't believe the plot of the sho was over the span of like 6 years 




 All mine was accurate except math. It went from 73 to like a 63. I was not happy 




 Thanks for the advice everyone. If anyone else has questions about the interview process I could probably answer them after today 




 This dude I work with said he only ate ramen for a whole month. He said he didn't go to the bathroom once the whole time and by the end his gums were bleeding. He's pretty sure he got scurvy

 Why does KISS look the way they do yet sound the way they do? 




 Seriously, I've asked a few questions that have gotten like 20 replies with only a couple upvotes. Only to be buried with the rest of them 




 For some they actually paid attention and learned a thing or two and enjoyed going to class 




 Watch all the cartoons my parents wouldn't let me watch. All those missed Pokemon episodes.. 














 Don't worry you'll be caught up on everything that's happened in the last years within a week or two 




 That is terrifying. I think it's the eyes. And the antlers obviously 




 I love how the buildings are so huge but scattered about enough to not just see one gigantic block 




 I'm in a college town and my friend has met up with a lot of girls from it. Some are cool, some aren't, either way an easy way to meet up though 




 I feel the same way about North Face. At this point tons of people wear the jackets just for fashion, yet NF still makes the jackets for their intended purpose 




 This is an ideology I can get behind

 Yes. 




 I'll have the matzoball soup 









 How could I change my channel? 




 I'd love to wear a button up and tie on occasion. I feel like I'd look weird though 




 Sorry you have had bad professors. 

I myself am a Senior here at WSU and have mostly taken classes in the Bio/chem departments. I have to say with the exception of my Engl 101 TA every professor I've had has been great. They are all experts in their fields, have been very good with explanations and keeping the class interested, and all their tests have been fair in accordance with the syllabus. Even the difficult classes I wouldn't complain about because they just require more studying.

If you are thinking of coming here, please do.  This is an awesome college with great programs (especially engineering).  Go Cougs! 




 Funny you should mention that. I just failed my first Immunology exam, and I too would agree it's been my hardest class to date 




 Rough wasn't it? Feels great to take that last chemistry class though 




 Could be high school, college, grad school etc. 




 I live where it gets sub freezing for the whole winter. Got one of those 3 in 1 Northface ski jackets and it's one of my best investments. Totally worth it if you plan on using one for years 









 How are there 2 of these comments with the exact same replies with different upvotes?? What is this sorcery?

 From the story I heard everyone there got a blue ribbon but PBR just started advertising their beer with that spin

 Yeah the CCR5 receptor. Apparently all apes are resistant to the virus. Just me considering possibilities here but with the high amounts of this virus concentrated in Africa maybe we will see more people with this mutation throughout generations to come. 









 Yep. Also possible brake with right foot but you just hope that doesn't happen

 I always get the supremely spicy hummus, so I guess that? 




 I'm confused by their argument, shouldn't every establishment be closed at night then? 




 This scene with George IMO is his best as a character. Just the true ideology of George all into one speech. And Jason is a great actor in it 




 Good luck! I'm sure you're prepared for it, just remember everything it took to get there

 Before this guy gets downvoted to hell just remember we're just considering options here 




 Anyone listening right now during all these sirens? Something about a person unconscious, medics going out  




 There's definitely a group mentalitiy in the workplace. If everyone there is friends with each other and happy then there's less chance they are going to leave. I work at a Walmart and my coworkers are actually pretty cool. Personally I won't be there much longer but it's not bad at the same time

 You always hear about business owners giving people shit for giving them bad reviews. I don't know what's going on here 




 Not to bust on the show here but after Who Wants to be a Godparent I can't blame him 




 Wow that is a daunting task

You should include a count number for all the scotches Ted and Barney drink

Now that I think about it is Marshal and Lily the only people who don't like scotch?  




 It's always fun when you show up to the date, see she looks nothing like her profile, and instantly know the next 3 hours are going to be awful.

Off Tinder though the girl was actually awesome and we had coffee and sang in the car. Of course, at the end she said she was one month away from actually being 18... 




 Not only that but that's a really famous line. How do you fuck up the order of it 




 Dangus the Mangus 




 Because no one wants to go into the dentists, so you have people who come in already hating you. Then you have a rough schedule to keep between their responsibilities. And people's mouths are gross 









 I've got the free breakfast sandwich if anyone wants brunch with me

 Seriously! In high school I was pretty quiet but people would always ask "are you alright?" Like yeah I'm alright now get out of my business! 




 Last week I finally finished Atlas Shrugged after months of reading it. I'd post my thoughts of it on here but too drunk and too many thoughts of it ha 




 Favorite book from high school.  




 Dude you are on a roll today 




 I like that umbrella part. I've also heard that With Tracy it was already raining, but with Robin Ted had to make it rain 




 That's exactly my point really. He's basing his whole exodus based on a republican be voted in next. Well who knows what the next republican might be like. Maybe he'll change America for the better 




 You do realize there have been more Republican presidents than Democratic ones right?  




 I think 100 million is a little much for this situation. For most people here that'd be over a million per year, and that would already be far more than most of us make. 

But Like other people said set up long term investments 




 That the girl you think is into you is definitely into you 




 Well my one item would have to be the check the lottery people wrote me. Then go back in time say the 40's when I can actually use the check. Of course then my present lottery winnings are worth fortunes more. I then buy the US government, bang the First Lady of the time. Then I'd die fighting in Germany whistling a Charlie Parker tune 




 Math. Which is weird because I can do physics/chem type math but actual math classes I've never been good with. I think it's the lack of application the book's present 




 I've done it a couple times. Met up with this one chick, we smoked and watched a movie. Later we were making out and she wanted to have sex but I didn't go through with it, kindof a weird time for me.

Other time she ended up being like 45 and again I didn't go through with it 




 I just want to work at an independent coffee shop in Seattle and live in a crappy apartment. I'm a senior in college now and think about seriously doing it all the time :/ 




 Holographic Pincer card for some lame card I had, can't  remember which

 Back in 8th grade my friends and I counted down the days til Battlefront 2 came out. Now I've been waiting years 




 The episode that's an entire freakin documentary of Robin Sparkles makes me want to punch somebody.  I mean it was funny at first but I feel like it became more of an inside joke for the actors/writers than to us the audience 




 TIL adenosine=adrenaline from a high school bio student 




 Same here and since Ted says it like 20 times in the episode I figured actually saying bitch each time would be a little ridiculous. I agree though c word makes more sense for reactions 




 I work at walmart and we have chip readers along with the magnetic ones. The chip ones seriously take at least a minute to read (sounds short but not when there's a line). If we're gonna use the chip readers they need to optimize them

 This is like straight out of a sitcom. Someone randomly playing the piano and it just happens to be a celebrity. I'm sure you guys will be telling that story for a long time 




 Tangled up we fall 




 A ball point banana! 




 I wouldn't say Marshal is two dimensional, but sometimes I feel like his personality is all over the place. I feel like they add traits to him for jokes but they don't always make sense for his charaacter 




 Fully agree with the changing thing. They made it sound like their only reason was "we want the kids to look like they're still the same age." Well through some more makeup on them because the Season 9 HIMYM is not Season 2 HIMYM 




 The only food I think of with Wisconsin now is their frozen custard. I wish I could eat that forever 




 How do they get the mail? 




 Grabs spork 




 I felt the same way. I think my biggest complain is they left out not only major characters but the major plot that went with said characters. We miss a lot of the conflict resolution with the film

 So after his face smashes into the steering wheel he thinks hmm that was nothing, guess I'll keep going. Then gets stuck again 




 A paragon!! 




 my 8th grade IMs.. I shudder to think. In high school the girl I always talked to wanted to go back and read them one day but I refused 




 I thought that word died out awhile ago. And I hate people who act like they're making Sperry's cool, as if they haven't been for like 100 years now 




 I've only seen this on the internet and still don't know what it means or how to pronounce it 




 Pumpkin beer is probably my favorite seasonal. The flavor is good but only for a short bit so one month of it is perfect 




 Ther's also the Bro Code book they made. It's actually pretty funny
