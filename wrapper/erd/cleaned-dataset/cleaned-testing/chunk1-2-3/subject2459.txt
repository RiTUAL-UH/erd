 Ok well the common answer is free will...

Ok I'm not gid (surprise!) So that is a great question since he would be right there unless of course the answer is free will. 




 Okaay... 




 Ha, ha I can imagine what that would be like :) 




 Ok. I'll pretend to be god...

Because if everything was perfect then no one would be human. Our experiences make us so and we must get into heaven, if everyone was perfect no one would be human. 




 Ok it's a bit rude but too each his own. 









 I'm not God (obviously... stop starring at me, I mean it!) I'm sure you will :) 




 Oh and I hope you enjoy the rest of your time in the navy and good luck at med school :) 




 Well since I was young I've wanted to be a doctor but I've also always loved history and just recently I've been inspired and I want to persue that or medicine. 




 Aaw that's nice. I like that more than anything I've seen so far. Just the reassurance :) 




 Sad, the cancer not your question. 




 Maybe, why don't you try and see, you never know... 




 Ha, ha good luck at med school (that's what I plan on doing, well either that or archaeology. It's always been medicine but now I'm questioning that). 




 Okaay... 




 Interesting :) 




 Okay I'll pretend to be god in two scenarios and answer with what you'd say:

1. You go to heaven, if you're good and hell if you're bad, in heaven you can get what ever you want whenever you want. See dead relative's and friends and live in eternal peace.

2. You do essentially just rot but you still have an overwhelming feeling of peace. 

What do you do? 




 Ha, ha sorry about that :D 




 Yup, I mean it would be nice but I guess that's just the way it is we could try and change it, people have but I don't think people can go without having conflict. 




 Ha, ha I can guarentee if you ask that to God you'll have sex with God :D unless he said maybe. 




 7, 4, 17, 32, 34, 27 




 Just joking I know what you meant :) 




 ?? (Sex talk time :) ) 




 Ha, ha inney? 




 That would be nice but I doubt that we will ever see it happen. 




 Aaah, well lets just say he is tired and wants you to simply ask him :) 




 Ha, ha what would *you* do? 




 Well with every answer comes more questions so it'd be nice to know so we can search for more answers. 




 I think he'd say something like "me"... I think 




 I wonder what he'd say 




 Lets just say you won a raffle and he wants you to ask him :) 




 Ha, ha, simple :s 




 Ha, ha! :D 




 I'd like to know that too :) 




 Ha, ha "still under development" 




 Ha, ha :) 




 Why? Nice, I guess it would be cool to hear the answer :) 




 I would love to know that too :D 




 Lots of people could *probably* answer that but God would answer it better, obviously :) 




 Cool question? 




 Wow guys! You have all asked some really awesome stuff! Keep 'em coming and I will talk to you guys and maybe answer (even though I'm not God, I mean it stop starring... I'm not!) :D 




 I see what you mean. Well I guess others would feel, shocked? 




 Also I just did a quick google search and tons of results came up from last week to last year to 2012, this has been posted a million times. 




 Okay but it **was** on the front page just the other day. 




 Don't get me wrong I love science, I'm acing biology and chemistry and I don't force my beliefs on anyone but I do have a religion: I'm catholic. 




 Actually they did it made the front page not too long ago. 




 Well religious people (like myself) would have reinforced beliefs and others would feel stupid for not believing. I think it would  be simmilar and maybe stop all the stupid internet arguments. 




 Man bear pig, South park! :D 




 This is a repost!  




 No I love dogs and everything to do with them :) 




 Good luck! Here's what I do:

I answer most questions with yes or no. Am I going to get my work done now instead of procrastinating? Yes. Am I going to fap? No. Am I...? Yes/no.

I'm also doing it to have a better outlook on life and change my views about certain things and for religious reasons. Good luck! :D 




 http://www.yourbrainonporn.com 




 You numb your dopamine receptors and it makes sex with real people less pleasureable and fun things in general but only with excessive masturbating. You **CAN** become dependent. It can lower self esteem and make you lazier (and more but this doesn't happen to everyone, like me I chose to stop for personal and religious reasons). 




 Slugs! (Or snails) 




 South park! :D 




 Cause it's easier to sing like that and sounds nice but many still sing in their home accents. 




 Hey good luck and meditation helps a lot! :) Oh by the way I think you should reset your badge.

Anyway don't think of this as bad it's actually great now you can learn from it. :) 




 Hi, I'm 15 so I obviously haven't had sex yet and I don't want to... well not yet, not for at least another 3-5 years and I would only do it with a girl I really care about. Anyway I want to know if there's anyway to get rid of sexual frustration? Since some of you have sex you don't need to worry about it but what kind of things could I do. (Oh and side note, don't know if it's important, I was never addicted to pmo but I wanted to stop anyway for a few reasons). 









 So I'm fifteen years old, I tried nofap a while back for a few reasons. Religion (I'm catholic), for myself, I wanted a better out look on things and to change my view. PMO made me feel like women all fake orgasms and that they're whores (if they're in porn) I shouldn't have judged them. 

I made it to four days last time and decided I would fap, I've never been addicted to it, because I said if I balance it, it's healthy and I don't need porn I can use my mind. All was going well but then I thought ok one porno isn't so bad so I watched some cartoon porn, I was watching it around 3 times a week then I went back to real porn. That's when I said no! No more. I'm gonna do nofap and I'm going to do it right this time. Tomorrow I go from a smiley face to a number 1. It isn't much but it's a big step for me. I've thought, over the last week, you're still early in just do it once, no big deal but straight away I said no. It'll be nice then but what about after? So I always said no and focused on something else. 

I read a post that said always say yes or no for things you're unsure about. Not maybe, not if this happens then, just yes or no. And so far no has been great here and yes has been great in other parts of my life. I know it's early and I have no huge results yet but I can do this and so can you. Good luck. 




 Thanks guys all of you seem to think it's fun with a friend, I'll pick it up :) 




 Hi I'm Devlin, I'm 15 years old and I'm from Scotland. AMA!

***Short Bio***

 I live in a city called Glasgow and I'm going through high school. I play a lot of xbox and I love to read, be it books, comic-books or short stories. My favourite genre is Science-Fiction but I'm open to read any genre. I love to write and I spend a lot of time studying. 

***Update***

 thanks for all of the questions guys/girls! Keep asking and I'll keep answering. I think I should answer this since a lot of you have asked if I like haggis. I've never tried it, I know that's strange but I do love other scottish foods and drinks like lorne sausage, shortbread, tablet, porridge (with milk and sugar) and of course irn bru (I'm drinking some now). :)

Oh and if any of you want any proof just ask and I can link my facebook :) 



















 **EDIT** It now shows me the percentage, it's been around half an hour and it's only at 3 % help! 




 Well I started nofap as an experiment, of sorts. Now I never went long like some of you have and that's fine with me. This is because 

 I was never addicted to porn 

and 

 I learned what I wanted from this.

What did I learn? That nofap is not for me, however, I'm not just going to go and watch a ton of porn but what I am going to do is moderate what I'm doing. I used to fap at least once-twice a day, I would occasionally miss one but I digress. Anyway now I'm going to only do it once-twice a week and maybe miss it every now and then. I think this is perfectly healthy, I won't be consumed by fapping,I'll have more time to spend on other things and I don't have to fight urges like I did these past few days. 

I do owe thanks to nofap because now I know what I want to do. Thank you all.

Who knows, I might want to try nofap again someday bt for now goodbye and thanks :) 




 **EDIT 1** Thanks every one for answering, don't worry I won't be expecting the stuff from porn in real life and I probably won't even use it but if fapping starts to have any kind of negative on me I will stop and come back here also I will only be doing it once, maybe twice, a week. 




 Hi, I'm relatively new here and I haven't relapsed since I started, actually it's been pretty easy. Now, however, all day I've been getting urges. I've been able to put them to bed but now it's just... It's getting to difficult. Even when I get rid of one boner another one isn't far away, and it's not like I'm thinking about or watching porn. I don't want to start again,I know if I make it through the first week I can keep going and I know I'll be disappointed if I fail, HELP! 




 Okay so I want to make it to ninety days and see where it goes from there. I heard the early parts are the hardest, no pun intended, and these first few days have been easy. I've kept my mind busy and when I've thought about fapping I just say no, I don't want to and I focus on something else but today I've had more boners than any other and I thought to myself it's fine because I'm only a few days in but I forced myself not to.

Do any of you have any tips on how I can stop urges when they arise? 









 I was playing games when I was 3 and first completed a game, gta vice city, when I was 4. I completed the  story in a few days and got 100% within a week or two. Then I went back and did all of the previous gtas before continuing on to tomb raider and halo etc 









 I know it's a bit unrealistic but anything can be done. I've been reading up on some tips. Do any of you have any that might help? 














 I just started here and went to add a badge, I thought you mailed them your birthday so I, apparently, haven't fapped since '99 :D 









 Hey, so I recently started meditating and I asked someone (who had been doing it for nine years) if I was doing it right and when I explained what it was like they said that it sounded like I got pretty close to jhana. He then said that that usually takes years for people to achieve. So I did some light reading on it but I don't fully understand it can someone who knows what it is or has experienced it explain it to me please.

**here is what I did the first time**

http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/2ssn39/am_i_meditating_properly/ 




 Hi. I recently started meditating which is making me feel great and I've known about lucid dreaming for a long time. I hear the best way to have them is to train yourself by you know doing something like trying to put your finger through the palm of your hand or holding your nose and still breathing but I've never been able to stick with them. You know getting into the routine of doing them naturally.

I have a few questions...

* is this right? Training yourself?

* if I do do this how long, roughly, should it take before I can lucid dream

* I hear before you can lucid dream you get sleep paralysis and must go straight back to sleep. Is this true?

* does the sleep paralysis happen to everyone?

Answering any of these is greatly appreciated. Thanks. 




 Hi everyone. First off I don't and never have smoked pot but my older brother does. To be honest I can't stand the smell of it and I'm against drugs in general even ones that don't do harm like pot. 

Anyway you all probably know that in school you're told 

"People do drugs to get high... drugs are bad"

But in my school they tend to make a point of it being a personal decision. So they explain it in detail that I know some places in the world don't but of course the teacher hasn't done the drug so...

While I don't smoke it I'm interested to see the appeal of it to those that do. How often do you smoke? Why? When did you first do it?

**EDIT 1** thank you all for your answers so far, keep em' comming. I'm still against smoking it myself but I have found it interesting to see why others do it.

**EDIT 2** Thanks for all the answers guys/gals. I have a different oppinion on weed now. I still don't and won't smoke it, I'm still against drugs in general, but I'm not going to lie I was pretty judgy to those that do now I see that there are a ton of reasons people smoke and I respect that. 




 Hi, I am very new to meditation, seriously I just started today. 

So my first try only lasted a few minutes. I stretched before hand breathed a bit then sat down with my legs crossed. I had my back straight and simply focused on breathing in and out. I imagined a flower opening and shutting with my breath. Then I started 'feeling' (not touching but actually feeling) my body. I started with my toes and move  onto my feet and heels. Then I worked up my legs and into my torso untill I could feel my stomach. After this I started focussing on my breathing again. Then I pictured myself in a beautiful and lush green forrest. I heard birds, smelled flowers and saw a deer. It was beautiful but I only saw it for a few seconds or so. 

Finally I stopped. I felt incredible, so relaxed. To be honest I only did it llike half an hour ago and I still feel great. My stomach feels 'funny' I don't know how to describe it. My hands also feel funny but for them it feels like I'm shivering even though I'm not cold. 

I'm just wondering if this is a good start? I'm definitely intrigued and I'm going to do it again the morning but I'm worried about the possability of an out of body experience. I've heard people can have horrible visions and some feel connected to their hody through a thin chord. To be honest I feel fine about the visions but the obe scares me. 

Is it possible to have one through meditation? If so is there anyway to prevent it? Finally am I doing it properly?

**EDIT 1** is it weird for me to feel this happy? 




 So I have a friend on the internet (through xbox) who recently lost a friend to cancer. He said his brother was a Buddhist monk and taught him how to meditate. He seemed to be dealing with his friends death pretty well although he was obviously saddened.

Anyway I've heard him speak of meditation a few times now. I've done it once before but I was like half asleep and never knew what I was doing. 

I was intrigued so I read up on some basic mediation. I stretched. Felt my body parts. Breathed calmly. I took my self to a forrest in my mind and just relaxed. It only lasted for a few minutes if that but it was really nice feeling and I'm catholic, I've been told meditation is good for religion which I'll definitely have to look into but this looks promising for me. 




 I loved 'psycho' so I was worried that they made this. Season 3 starts soon and I read some reviews which say it's very good. I was worried that it might ruin psycho for me. Anyway is it worth watching? 









 Hi, I'm from Scotland, UK and like I said above I'm fifteen. Go ahead ask me anything! 














 When I play my xbox it will randomly freeze in game or on the dashboard.  This is happening alot! Seriously it just keeps happening, I've tried doing a power cycle but still it keeps happening, any suggestions? 









 I watch a lot of US tv shows and movies but what do they miss out that would be weird compared to the way I live? 









 It seems like we hear a lot about cancer nowadays but why did we not hear about it in say in medieval times or quite as much in the fifties etc? Was it due to fear or just that it has been mutating more in recent years?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your answers you've all been a big help :) 




 Edit: thank you everyone for your great answers! :D 









 I've been seriously considering teaching as a career. I love kids and I would love to be able to imoact them and make school fun while still teaching them what they need to know.

I'm from Scotland, UK so the education system might be different where you're from but I have a few questions...

1. Is it rewarding? I like to think it would be but I don't want to go into it and be disappointed

2. What don't you like about it?

3. What is your favourite thing about it?

Also I want to either teach at a primary school age (elementary) or as a history teacher in a high school.

 




 Please don't get angry at me for asking and if this question offends anyone I'm sorry. Im catholic so I don't understand why you wouldn't want your prophet shown, please explain it. 




 He was looking at pictures of women in thongs were spiderman was walking behind them and he said:

"Yeah, I have a whole subreddit for superhero thong shots"

Other people wouldn't have got that joke. After the episode aired I checked and someone had already made a new subreddit for superhero thong shots...

/r/superherothongshots 









 Okay so I'm from Scotland and I'm in high school. In two weeks time I have prelims, they are essentially practice exams but they're still important cause, well I won't get into it but failing them is bad.

Anyway I'm a pretty smart guy and I never really fail tests but when it comes to exams my mind kind of blocks. I really don't want to fail.

Also I play way to much xbox, I know this but when I have to choose between studying and xbox 7/8 times out of 10 I'll go with xbox even though I know it's the wrong choice.

Anyway I need to know how I can force myself to study and not sit on xbox/reddit.

P.s please don't tell me to pull out my xbox plug I've tried that.
 




 Ok before you answer please don't say that we wear kilts, we only wear them at formal occasions and only some of us do it, they're normally only worn at weddings and funerals. 




 Hey everyone, I'm a HUGE xbox fan. I've had the original and 360 since their launches. I was going to get the xbox one on launch day but decided to wait a year because that's when the games I wanted came out. Anyway I know about the ability to video gameplay and upload it to skydrive and youtube but is it easy to use? 

Can you... add in music?
... make and intro?

Also can you tell me any cool features that you can use with it? 














 Okay so I'm 15 and I've wanted to be a doctor for as long as I can remember. My twin brother has cerebal pulsey (I think that's how you spell it) and slight autism. He can walk and talk and do everything everyone else can do to some degree but when we were young he was in the hospital for an operation and I knew after that, that I wanted to be a doctor.

Anyway I've been well on track. You know highest grades in all my classes and getting great reports but I don't think I'm up to it. I've always been a gamer, seriously I got the original xbox when I was 5 and before that I had the ps2 anyway I've always been able to balance school and gaming but now I find myself on my xbox and writing fanfictions more than anything. 

My grades have started slipping and I know if I stopped gaming I could probably get them back but I don't want to stop completely. Also I have pretty severe asthma so I miss quite alot of school during the winter when it gets bad which makes catching up hard aswell.

I still want to be a doctor but even if I put in the work I don't think I could make it so I would rather focus on something else and pass rather than try for years and fail.

I love writing and I love history. I've considered becoming a history teacher but I don't know if I would enjoy teaching the same stuff over and over again for years. So I thought about becoming a writer but I'm not sure if I would like to write a book or work for a company or anything else. I've started stressing because I don't know what my future will hold and to be honest I'm scared I'm going to mess up and get a crappy job.

Does anyone have any ideas on what I could do? I want to do something that makes me happy but I don't know what that is yet. 





























 Hi everyone, I have an account with everything on it but my sister doesn't. She has only just started playing and I was wondering if anyone could help her out. She doesn't use reddit and she asked me how I got my stuff when I said through reddit she asked if I could get her some. If you can please comment or message me.  














 Ok so I need one that can, as the title says, run both the Sims 3   4, my budget is 400, please leave a link to one that I can buy that I don't need to build (if it's a desktop). I know it's alot to ask but if anyone could help it would be much appreciated, I can  also add delivery charges if I need to. 




 Hey everyone, so I've always been more of a console gamer, only using my laptop for the Sims when gaming on it. Anyway it broke and I need a new one that has the system requirements for me to play both the Sims 3   4 with expansions for 3. Please help. Leave a link to one that I can buy but I only have 400. 

















































 I know a lot of people like that, me not so much I don't spend that much time on them. 




 Oh that's too bad, a pretty young age to start, you should ask your doctor about ways to quit. 




 I think a lot of people have that :) 




 Me too :) 




 That's not so great, maybe you should talk to her about it or get some kind of help. If you don't she might leave you and you'll regret it. Hope everything turns out ok. 




 I love gaming, I don't really exercise but I game a lot!!  




 That's not so bad, I love music too :) 




 Ha, ha okaaaay. 




 Not drugs or alcohol etc 




 Yeah, I mean you don't have to do it for ***everything*** I know I don't but it helps with quite a lot. It actually wasn't my idea, I saw it on another post and used it from there :) 




 I've always wondered about this, if it is Earth where are other planets and/or stars. Why is only Earth visible? 




 No, I think you're thinking about call of duty. Halo doesn't get all those 13 year olds spamming the chat. 




 Oh my god!! That's awesome as a huge halo fan that ring makes me want to kill someone for it but that's great for both of them. 




 Hey welcome to nofap. You're in a good position that you have college to keep you occupied and a girlfriend who you have sex with. Anyway it won't be easy but good luck, here are some [tips](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2vrsoe/wow_times_flown_by_nine_day_report_and_some_tips/)
 




 No, the guy in the picture is from an episode of south park and he says:

"... your gonna have a bad time" 

Throughout the whole episode. So I made it for south park fans. 




 Okaydokay 




 Thanks :D 




 Okay, the guy in the picture is only in one episode and he constantly says your gonna have a bad time. 




 Thanks for all the tips, 15 here, never been addicted to PMO but wanted to quit cause I don't like what it does to people in the long run. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2vrsoe/wow_times_flown_by_nine_day_report_and_some_tips/

Here are some tips to help you through, good luck!! :) 




 No matter what don't have an affair. Either leave yiur wife if you're un happy or stay with her and her alone. 




 Cbc? (Conspiracy?!!) 




 True. Do you like south park? 




 Okay. 




 I'm 15, almost 16, hang in there. Just think if you do it right you can lead a virtually porn free life!! :D here are some tips I poste  yesterday, hopefully they'll help.

http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2vrsoe/wow_times_flown_by_nine_day_report_and_some_tips/ 




 Ha, ha I'm sorry but that's funny. I saw the post that inspired this sub, I highly doubt we would all lose the ability to sneeze. 




 I think it would just be another forgotten website. 




 So it's some kind of joke?  




 Sure...

* Less anxiety

* more do less talk

* more motivated

* less procrastination

* Better view of women

* more confidence

* better self image

* control of your body

* deeper voice

* more time

* less embarrassment

* not having to worry about clearing search history

* and tons more! :D 




 I mean I get /r/nofap (I'm a part of it) but why /r/nosneeze? 




 I love it on christmas day when I look around at my family, just for a few seconds, and I look at their huge smiles.  




 Dying light. It has really fun co op with friends and a huge map you'll likely have way more fun on that than on evolve. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2vrsoe/wow_times_flown_by_nine_day_report_and_some_tips/ 




 Hey welcome to /r/nofap!! Good luck I hope this sub helps you out I leave a link to some tips I posted yesterday that might help you out.

Good luck!! :D 




 Good luck! We can both make it there!! :D 




 Me too :) good luck!! 




 Good luck! 




 I'm at ten days too! :D great job and good luck. I'm having all these benefits too. I'm more of an indoor/gamer type person but I'm going out more, seeing friends that I normally only see at school and the dreams have been great, a lot more vivid but of course Istill play a ton of xbox :) 




 Happy single awareness day!! :D

Good luck :) 




 Nice picture (I like how you added the fapstronaught :) ) 




 That's not what anyone here thinks. We decide not to fap for a ton of reasons:

* More time

* Better sex (actually able to finish unlike a lot of people who watch porn)

* more energetic

* more confidence

* better outlook on life

* in control of our bodies

* and a million more!

Research this sub before you talk crap about it! 




 Great job so far! So close! :D 




 Sorry, what? 




 Wow great job making the ring! And congratulations on your engagement I hope you two have a great wedding, a wonderful honeymoon and a fantastic life together :) 




 Nah don't reset I mean that's different when you're awake it's different but it was still just a dream. 




 Hey I'm 15 so I don't think it makes it mored difficult. In fact we're lucky because we can actually live a porn free life, good luck! :) 




 Ha, ha :) 




 Ha, ha :)


"By this point she'd been dead longer than I knew her"

I guess him and Mona got kinda close. 




 Ha, ha Randy is great I loved it in season 18 when he was Lorde :D 




 Do you mean in ways of an affair? If you do, don't it's wrong. If you mean you want to move on then just go out meet people, ask friends to set you up, try online dating. 




 Final fantasy has some great love stories. 




 I know right! I love it, what's your favourite episode? 









 I know right! :) 




 I hate uncharted, more of a TR guy but I get why people like it :) 




 Nice choice, I loved them together :) 









 I liked it, it was exciting... I just realised how sad I am. 




 I know!! :D 




 I'm 15 so I really don't want to... yet. 




 Were I was attacked by Freddy Krueger. You all know the movie right? Well I've watched it a million times and it's still never scared me (lets be honest who has it scarred?) and to be honest this dream was awesome!

So I was in the dream and he was in my kitchen, I grabbed a knife and tried to stab him, knowing it wouldn't work, I ran outside with him still chasing me. I met a girl I knew and he had been tormenting her too so I gave her the knife and said:

"Hurt yourself! Cut your arm, feet something!"

She said 

"Why?!"

And I replied

"If you can hurt yourself in the dream you'll wake up but just don't make it something that can kill you!"

So she did and all of a sudden she vanished so I picked up the knife and tried to hurt myself, Freddy still getting closer, but it wouldn't work no matter what I tried, the knife was like plastic now. Eventually he caught up and started suffocating me while laughing. I managed to get him off and ran for the hills. I don't remember much else but it was amazing!! (Because you know I love movies and the first nightmare and elm street is one i have a soft spot for). 




 I made it to get /r/freedonuts for the simpsons tapped out and then I realised there were a billion and one other things to do here so I decided that I would check it out and use it, now I love it! :)

My username is xbog4mer because I'm a gamer that plays xbox also I like the number 4. 




 I'm 15 but I turn 16 next month :) 




 Ha, ha nice question.

Searching amazon for masquerade masks and ball gowns.

Their porn would be a woman undoing her hundred button boots

Searching for the nearest carriage number.

Checking how much it costs to travel to the new world :) 




 Ha, ha thanks :) 




 Nah, I prefer xbox but you can't deny how awesome they'd be. Sure they copied her, then she copied them but still it would be nice. 




 Oh by the way I'm a HUGE xbox fanboy and prefer Lara but I hope everyone can appreciate how cool they'd be together. 




 That's why I want to stop, it's not a problem so this has been relatively easy for me but I want to stop before it becomes a problem. 









 http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2vrsoe/wow_times_flown_by_nine_day_report_and_some_tips/

I wrote that earlier, there's some tips if you want them. I love dragon age. Bioware are great I can't wait for ME4 




 A slug! Or a snail! 




 Yeah I feel great and yeah gaming I'm doing it now while I'm talking to you :) How's your nofap going? 




 No but it brings you closer to orgasm which is basically setting yourself up to fail. 




 Yeah. If I don't thay stay in my trousers and it's kinda painful. 




 Bill Gates 




 If you want. I wasn't addicted or anytbing either but I decided to try it and it's going great! You seem like you have it under control so if you don't want to that's cool but it will only work if you really want to stop. 




 Awesome, I love playing classical, romantic and modern (I like everything really but they're my favourites). 




 Good luck to you! :D 




 Thank you, good luck! :D 




 No cause then I wouldn't have learned from it but I think this sort of stuff should be taught in schools so that people don't fall into it.

Anyway good luck to you! :D 




 Thanks! I've never been addicted or anything but it was making me lazy and I was thinking things like all women fake orgasms. I know that's not true but when I do have sex it'll be with a girl I care about (at least 3-5 years from now, I don't want to have it too young). It will be much better than fapping. Anyway good luck to you :) 




 That's great! What's your favourite song to play? 




 This shouldn't be in /r/gaming it should be in /r/gambling 




 Do the small things. Volunteer for a charity. Donate old things. Give a homeless person a nice hot drink and a sandwich. 




 Don't give up you can do it! Here I wrote a report an  some hints earlier, hopefully they'll help...

Good luck!
 




 I know most people do these on their tenth day but hell I'm in a great mood.

I've been studying more, playing less xbox but still enough for fun and of course I don't waste time fapping. I'm only 15 so obviously I'm a virgin which made me think:

"I don't know if I want to quit cause I won't have sex for years"

But it's worth it. It feels like I stopped yesterday and sure I've had alot of urges but this is fun and I'm already seeing some benefits!

Good luck to all of you out there. I'll leave some tips for those of you that feel like you can't make it.

* Say "YES" or "NO" to everything. Am I going to fap? NO! Am I going to study now instead of procrastinating? YES use this and it really helps.

* Use the 10-10-10 rule. If you fap now how will you feel in 10 minutes? In 10 hours? And if you quit nofap how will you feel in 10 years?

* A lot of men on here say they have trouble "finishing" during sex because of how much they've fapped, I'm only 15, like I said, but I don't want that to happen when I do have sex. Do you?

* Think of the fact that porn is just filmed prostitution. No one wanted to be a porn star as a kid. 

* If you want you can meditate, I do and it helps.

* I'm religious so that's a motivation for me.

* Think of the regret you'll feel later.

* don't try and stop urges just acknowledge them and then say ah well now I'm going to go and... (do something else, basically acknowledge it and move on)

Good luck guys/girls!! :D
 




 So true but many people in porn actually enjoy it I remember a few pornstars doing AMA's a while back. Of course most of the time what you said is the truth. 




 I'm 15, porn got me when I was 11/12. I was never addicted but I have a few ways to stop fapping when I think about it.

1. Think that porn is just filmed prostitution and that it is wrong 

2. Break questions down into yes or no. Should I fap, no. Should I do my homework now, yes. Should I...

3. Think about all the guys on here that say they can't cum when they have sex due to PMO. How horrible it would it be if you lose your virginity (if you haven't yet, I haven't and I don't want to for a few more years yet) and you can't "finish". 

4. Think about the 10-10-10 rule (yes I got that from another post). How will you feel in 10 minutes if you fap now? How will you feel in 10 hours? And how will you feel in 10 years if you quit nofap now?

Good luck :) oh and try not to thibk about porn or sex so much, I never really have but who knows everyone is different. When porn/fapping/sex comes to mind acknowledge it and then send it away and think about something else. (Meditation helps too, I've been doing it for a bit now and it's really nice). 




 I know right, hopefully this will stop at least one relapse. 




 No don't reset it but learn from it and try not to do it again, good luck. 




 ...Filmed prostitution. Would you have sex with a prostitute? Would you watch someone else? That's all porn really is. It's disgusting (even if it doesn't seem like it when you watch). Think of this if you consider relapsing, you're about to be part of the reason that there is a demand for "filmed prostitution". Instead don't be, even if you, yes you, alone don't take part in it then you will know that. It might not make a difference, it won't make porn go away but at least you won't be part of the problem. 




 I'm 15, I started when I was 11/12. I've never been addicted but I just don't want to be a part of filmed prostitution, cause that's all porn is. 




 Okaaay  




 Ha, ha mine too (next to milk, not together... obviously) 




 Hey no problem :) good luck. 




 Hopefully not too long. 




 Ha, ha never :) 




 Ha, ha my sister and her bf of 6 years recently had a kid, she's almost two. Anyway she asked "what's that?" Talking about her vagina when she was getting changed so my sister told her "that's your wee lady" (we're Scottish so imagine the accent). Then the next day she's naming and pointing at my body parts when she's visiting me. Eyes, nose, ears, mouth, hair, wee lady. I'm so happy I wasn't in public but I burst out laughing! :D 




 I like your thinking! :D 




 Oh god, that wasn't even funny embarassing, I hooe your husband was ok :) 




 I don't know I'm not god. I can't answer this but I still have faith. I'm going to stop here cause I don't want these comments to turn into a religious battle (ha, ha battle with swords and stuff) but if you want to talk feel free to pm me. It's up to you :) 




 Ha, ha that must've been bad :) I mean do you laugh at it now (even though it was likely embarassing at the time) or do you still try and forget about it? 
























 I just relapsed today, don't worry about it. I'm just going to pick myself up an  learn from it. Here, good [luck](http://imgur.com/cU848GQ) 









 The last time I started nofap I made it to twelve days and decided ah well... I guess you can guess what happened. Now I'm resetting my counter for the third and last time!! If anyone else is really serious message me and we can help each other stay on track but if you're not serious please, don't waste my time. 




 Hey no problem :) 




 I'm a guy, I do. I think it looks nicer going bald for a number for a number of reasons. It makes you look bigger, if you know what I mean. It looks cleaner. Feels nice and smooth. And a million other reasons. 




 I understand about most things being drugs but I'm talking about illegal drugs. Even if it became legal though I wouldn't go near it just like I don't smoke ciggarettes. 




 Cause it's a drug, I would never go near it but I'm not against those that do. To each his own. I dislike the idea of it cause it seems to dumb down those that take it and it stinks worse than anything!! 




 But I grabbed his arm back, then a monstrous creature arose from the drug. It turned out it was a super scary homogenous sassy Hasidic Jewish snow yeti... 




 It turns out uncle Ben, yes old uncle Ben who is always so kind and collected, was part of an underground snail racing club and they were feeding the snails steroids. When I bailed him out we went home. He laughed about it, even back then. When we got home we walked into our tiny, tiny apartment and we couldn't believe what we saw...

 Hi I'm scottish too :)

I...

* Get up

* eat

* wash

* Get dressed

* watch tv

* go to school  




 I'm not done with it by my face has gotten longer and I look a lot better.  




 Yeah, I love his videos. I've been watching him since he only had a few thousand subscribers (I'm not a hipster :) ) but yeah his videos are supercalifragilisticexpidaliotious. 




 Can I ask, do you watch Matthew Santoro on YouTube? 




 Jesus Christ!! Yes! Tell someone and help get it dealt with. 




 Exact same for me I have a big family my mum has it better/worse depending on how you look at it. She had 7 brothers and 6 sisters and  5 of the boys are dead. 




 I know right they foreshadowed what's going to happen to poor Glenn, Mwahaha, mwahahahaha!! 




 I know I'm not him but a lot of celebrities make reddit accounts so they can do AmA's I mean look at /u/boogibs she did her Ama, posted one more thing and left. She might not be a big name but it's still the same. 




 Did you like the way you died on the Walking Dead? Do you think Tyreese deserved better or do you think it was his time? 




 Ok thanks (I'm so I don't have a wife yet). 




 You're welcome, good luck again :) 




 I've done (am still doing) nofap and it was/is very helpful but I was just wondering if masturbation is a sin. 




 Hello, first of all thank you for not just assuming that all religious people are "bible bashing idiots" and taking the time to form your own opinions. I have many reasons for following my religion. Jesus was alive, that has been proven, now people might not believe in the virgin birth or in the miracles like we do, however, I think that even if it turns out that every religion on Earth is wrong it is better to believe in something, anything, and have a chance at going somewhere better. Now that's not why I follow my faith. I follow it cause it's a nice way to live life. Sure even non religious people can lead great lifes and most do but it's nice having some guidelines. Also I feel like we have added emotions. When we feel like we've done something good that will please the lord it lasts long and if we sin the guilt is immediate. I also wonder how people can look at our  universe and not believe in god. I don't believe everything in the bible for example Adam and Eve. I think that story is used to show why there is sin and suffering in the world. When people ask why a god would allow such horrible things like rape and murder to exist the answer isn't simple. I don't know it. I don't. I'm having trouble wording this but religion is there and I would be willing to die for mine. I know that sounds extreme but it's true. I have a million and one thoughts in my head but I can't word them so if they come to me later I will return and re write/word this post. Good day and god bless. 




 I'm not saying there is but don't you think it would be better to say nothing than say something mean? Or at least try and say something nice. Obviously you have an opinion and I respect that but I don't agree with how you voice it. 




 All done, good luck with your project. When you get an A+ come back and let us know :) (no but seriously I hope you do well). 




 Thank you, so I should stop. Whenever I "finish" I feel horrible. It's like I know I've sinned but I chose to do it anyway. 




 I know how you feel, I lost my dog. I'll say a prayer for you just now. I do think that animals get into heaven. I don't believe God would create them simply to send them to hell and I definitely don't believe that they just rot. So that leaves me with the conclusion that they get into heaven. 




 I'll add you to my prayers :) 




 I'll pray for you :) 









 I'm not the best looking or the worst and I'm not saying looks aren't important but I would much rather spend time with a girl who was a bit ugly but had a great personality than a girl that looked great but had a not so great personality. 




 Ok so if someone isn't great looking you make them feel bad by swearing? If you thought they were ugly you shouldn't have said anything cause it hasn't made you or them feel any better. 




 I know a ton of people my age that party, I just don't really enjoy being around people I don't know (I'm kind of introvert but happy and confident around friends but put me in an uncomfortable social situation and I become a weird version of myself. If I like someone though I will ask her out after weeks of forcing myself to just say it). Yeah a lot of 15 year olds party just not very regularly. 




 That's horrible. They went to a dance and had fun people's looks don't matter and I wouldn't say either of them are ugly... [this](http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=fat+and+ugly FORM=HDRSC2#view=detail id=AF9B62FE4D44CEB1E87FEE2D874F29F5B93C03EA selectedIndex=116) is ugly!!

(By the way I wasn't joking neither of them are bad looking). 




 Good for you two, hope you both had fun :) , 




 I never go out to parties :) 




 I know right!! (I used a kind of crappy app cause I was bored) 




 I want to be an archaeologist and I'm lucky cause I live in Scotland which still needs archaeologists. Failing that I want to study medicine and become a medical doctor. I also want to meet a girl, get married and have tons of kids but that can wait for a while :) 




 Dogs by far. They listen, play with you, spend time with you and will stand by you. Cats just sit there. I spend more time with my dogs than I do with people. 




 Thanks I found something that works for me :) 




 Although I'm not going to take it as a negative. I was twelve days though and as a teenager my hormones are already a mess so I was getting a lot of urges, for the most part I was able to fight them but then I said:

 I know I'll feel crappy and I know this and I know that but I want to...

So after I did it (don't worry I never used porn) I said:

"Okay no big deal, just get back up and start again"

And that's what I intend to do. This time I'm going to beat twelve days. I'm going to get up dust myself down and try again. This is actually good because I learned from it and that's why I'm not going to get mad or angry at myself. I got overly confident, the first ten days were fine so I became cocky, no more. So I'll see you all when I get another (1) in my badge and then a (2) and all the way up. For now I'm going to take it one day at a time. 




 Nice post!! :D 




 I love(d) scrubs but I feel like it got pretty bad when J.D wasn't there for the last while. I mean they referenced him but it wasn't the same. I still loved every season. 




 I want to be an archaeologist, I guess here it's different. I don't really know many people that consider themselves "photographers". 




 I know what you mean. I guess I just never noticed it before but sex is everywhere. I love the movie bad teacher but when I watched it again for the first time in a year or so last week I got so turned on. There's a carwash scene that I used to just shrug off but it's weird to see just how sexual everything actually is. 




 A lot of people say that it takes 90 days (+-30) before you see any real benefits so you have two options.

* Quit and try and moderate it but just don't watch porn

* push through for one more month and take it from there.

Good luck :) 




 I can back this up, as a socially awkward "nerd" I had few friends and in one of my first classes in high school I was made to sit with some guys. They became my best friends and we hung out all the time. That was just by chance.  




 Thanks you two :) 




 Do you shave? Which moisturizer do you think is best? 




 Great review, you just got a new sub!! :D 




 I loved that game, still do I've completed every tomb raider made (besides the crappy game boy ports) :) 




 Are you just finding this out? Ah well pretty cool huh? 




 Ha, ha that got on my nerves!! :) 




 I have long hair so for me I couldn't do that but kudos!! :D 




 Yeah go for it, just don't let your parents find out and if they do tell them you like her and want to go out with her. 




 So the past 11 days have been kinda easy for me so I checked nofap frequently and constantly reminded myself why I wanted to do this. Then today I never really came here and I was fine through most of it. You know the saying:

"Sex sells"

Well because of porn I never really noticed this and when I was watching tv there were so many hot things that I used to just shrug off. At first I was fine I did the usual, remind myself why I was doing it and said will I fap? NO! Then did the 10-10-10 rule. I was fine but it got worse so I edged onced but stopped midway and said:

"Do I want to throw the last eleven days down the drain? Do I want to feel the regret later?" I stopped and listened to some music. I now know 100% why I'm doing this. So I'm happy to say I don't have to reset my counter today and I've learned from this. Thank you all for the motivation here on nofap. 




 Ok thanks :) 




 How short do you leave it? I shaved it but I'm fine with letting it regrow to a certain length. I do think that if it's short it looks like you're just starting puberty. On the flip side I have something that's stopped all itching, nivea men 48 hr for sensitive skin, it's stopped all itching. 




 Do you shave? 




 Nah but I just got sick of my pubes getting caught on my boxers is all. 




 Good luck!! :D 




 I can imagine what are you studying. 




 Do you shave? 




 I know right :) 




 Okay that's what I did thank you :) 




 I've already shaved. I did it in the bath. Shaving cream, stroke, under water and then repeat. 




 Don't worry I'm 15 I don't plan on sex for another few years 




 Oh... thanks anyway. 




 Ok thanks. 




 Ok do you/have you shave(d)? How can I prevent an itch? 




 ***UPDATE*** can I ask, what do girls prefer? I don't plan on having sex any time soon but I'm just wondering. I know it varies from girl to girl. If you are a girl what do you prefer and if you're a guy what do you do? 




 Yes but it wasn't in this sub. I've always wanted to be a doctor but I love history too and I spoke to an archaeologist and she really inspired me now I'm studying that and I'm very grateful to her. 









 I found out today someone even made a sub called /r/yesfap just to oppose this!! 




 All done, I'm 15 so I'm obviously a virgin 




 Don't reset your counter, dreams don't count :) 




 I love Jenna Marbles she's hilarious!! 




 Check out /r/nofap if you want to quit the masturbating. 




 Ha, ha there's a few reasons say it like this:

Fap-stro-naut sounds like fap so not. We won't fap.

We're doing something most people won't

And if we stop fapping our life can finally take off (like a rocket) we get more self esteem, energy etc, etc. 




 Good luck!! You can do it, here are a few [tips](http://m.imgur.com/cU848GQ) that might help you out. :) 




 I agree. 




 If I were you I'd go to a doctor or you could try /r/nofap that takes away anxiety and gives a lot of benefits. Still I suggest you see a doctor incase something's wrong. 




 I know that's true. I had a dream were I failed it was awful but I woke up and couldn't believe that I was still going I was happy and it reminded me how bad it could get if you give in. 




 Ha, ha great job, good luck aswell you can do it!! :D If you want them here are some [tips](http://m.imgur.com/cU848GQ) that might help you. 




 Hey I like your attitude. Here are a few [tips](http://m.imgur.com/cU848GQ) that might help you out. For music wise I suggest Clean bandit, they play instruments beautifully and when they work with Jess Glynn it comes out amazing!! Their songs 'Real Love' and 'Rather Be' are great. Good luck. 




 Ha, ha :D 









 I played it, I loved it and I never had to deal with them. 




 Ha, ha :) 




 Thanks :) 




 Aaaw :) 




 I see what you're saying.  




 If it did you wouldn't be able to move around your house. 




 I love jurassic park!! 




 No I'm not I wanted to stop because I saw on here all of the negatives and I didn't want become like that, before I started I was only fapping once or twice a week.  




 Things like gaming can be considered addiction as the it exhibits the same withdrawl symptoms as drugs, chocolate and coffee contain caffein and porn has negative effects on the brain. 




 I love music and learning too :) 




 Well I love halo :) 




 I play the keyboard, piano, drums and glock :) 




 Maybe it has nothing to do with nofap I would go to a doctor if I was you and take it from there but do mention nofap to him/her. 




 Oh well waters good for you :) 




 Ha, ha you are excused :) 




 I love music too what instrument(s) do you play? 




 Cool well happy hoarding. 




 Oh that's too bad I couldn't live without milk. 




 I LOVE chocolate milk I drink it everyday!! :)

 Milk's nice and oretty good for you I drink a lot of that. 




 I love the justice league!! :D you should do the next few after the suicide squad. 




 I'm not fat but I drink more milk than anyone I know and I love chocolate!! :D 




 That's good you can still drink them but just do it in moderation, it will be good for you too since they both contain tons of sugar and sweeteners. 




 Cool but really 13TB oh my god you must have a lot!! :) 




 Ha, ha I think that's the strangest I've heard yet but if you enjoy it who am I to judge :) 




 Me too, I'm on here a lot recently. 




 Ooooh me too :) 




 Ha, ha I buy xbox games to play them although I must admit I do love the smell of new shoes. 




 Ha, ha :) good luck  




 Ha, ha I don't think I will.
