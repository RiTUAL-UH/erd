Snapchat doesn't make any money

Instagram BARELY makes any money...

I can go on and on...but how many of these social apps and e-businesses/websites truly are interested in making money? 

From what it seems to me, many of these firms are looking for buy-outs from bigger firms...not actual inventions that change people's lives and improve social experiences or fix problems. 

A lot of the instant fame and accolades from the creativity of the app world may start out with a legit interest in creating something fun and enjoyable, but when it comes to making money, so few of these items seem to be able to truly turn any legitimate profit outside of the endless pit of buyouts and acquisitions.  




 It stuns me that theres not one available for the iPhone...and I'd much rather have my phone than an extra piece of hardware.

Plus, if I needed it for a test or secure location, i'd know it.

 Again, why does that mean you have to kill people? 




 Lets not ignore RACISM AND WHITE SUPREMACY as well 




 we have video from inside the event that was live-streamed and you're saying its staged? Hilarious.

 Yeah they are. LOL
 














 
Why can't muslims respect western values of freedom of speech? 









 Well, they are geographically closer to islamic countries

 Something I wrote a while back when someone said I couldn't "prove" barack is an atheist, or at least really someone who is privately very liberally religious.

***About his mother*** *"This isn't to say that she provided me with no religious instruction. In her mind, a working knowledge of the world's great religions was a necessary part of any well-rounded education. In our household the Bible, the Koran, and the Bhagavad Gita sat on the shelf alongside books of Greek and Norse and African mythology. On Easter or Christmas Day my mother might drag me to church, just as she dragged me to the Buddhist temple, the chinese New Year celebration, the Shinto shrine, and ancient Hawaiian burial sites. But I was made to understand that such religious samplings required no sustained commitment on my part. Religion was an expression of human culture, she would explain, not its wellspring, just one of the many ways and not necessarily the best way  that man attempted to control the unknowable and understand the deeper truths about our lives."*


His biological [father](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama,_Sr.)? Atheist.

His [mother](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/obama/chi-0703270151mar27-archive,0,2623808.story)? Atheist AND anthropologist (understanding human society and behavior)

His [grandfather](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Armour_Dunham) and [grandmother](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madelyn_Lee_Payne_Dunham) that raised him? Both vocal atheists (talks about this a lot in his books)


Simply put: Black people aren't getting elected if they're not religious.

Visit [**/r/BlackAtheism**](/r/BlackAtheism) more and we discuss this in detail.

Quotes like this and that [speech from 2006](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvKX16Eygs0) he did where he espouses his problems with referring to the bible show me that hes a closet atheist/very agnostic person that is playing the game of political musical chairs.

Don't forget this: http://i.imgur.com/BVt0i.jpg


He "found" god @ 26 as a community organizer in Chicago and if you know chicago, theres a lot of black people there and you're not going to get famous there, as black man, without the black vote which comes from black churches. He had to play the game.

Grew up in extremely diverse settings, i'm sure having memories of madrasas allowed him to contrast that with the radical christianity in america....

Hes one of the smartest presidents, *on paper*, that we've ever had. Remember, they tried to make fun of him because he went to the best schools in the country? I mean come on as if being a biracial kid raised by a single mother (even though she used to work for the Ford Foundation...LOL) isn't a massive hurdle in life.

Every chance he gets hes always promoting STEM fields and human achievement. Not willy nilly passive goals. 

He rarely says that prayer influences his decisions a-la Bush 1 or 2, or even the possibly closet atheist that clinton was said to be. Faith is never a member of his team of decision makers.

When he forgets to pray people blow their lids off and call him unamerican. He left god out of the verbatim recitation of various historical [documents](http://theydontfoolme.com/118/three-years-in-a-row-obama-fails-to-thank-god-at-thanksgiving/) and [speeches](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/25/obama-god-thanksgiving-speech_n_1113295.html) and [9/11](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/09/11/fox-omits-the-facts-to-politicize-9-11/189827)

Hes not religious **At all.**

Every time he opens his mouth about christianity it sounds [forced as hell](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/21/obama-religious-quotes_n_1292116.html).
I'm not going to go into his politics or anything...but I think to call him a closet atheist, is not a far stretch at all. I know /r/atheism loves the "wheres the evidence" claim, but to be honest here. [Obama has had more secular groups at the white house than any other president](http://content.usatoday.com/communities/Religion/post/2010/02/atheists-meet-with-white-house-officials/1) , a point verified by many fundie-right wingers; so i'm sure they'd be honest about feeling threatened. He only refers to religion during times of [tragedy](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/02/obama-on-faith-praying-for-egypt-gabby-giffordsand-for-patience-as-malia-goes-to-her-first-dance-wit/), mandatory events like [prayer breakfasts](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/obama-hosts-easter-prayer-breakfast-with-meditation-on-suffering/2012/04/04/gIQAhW7lvS_story.html)...or when hes [trolling the GOP like he recently basically said "this is what jesus would do,"](http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/02/news/economy/obama_tax_rich_jesus/index.htm) to try and convince them to adopt his politics.

He trolls religion regularly. Its obvious. Why else do you think all the fundies are scared they would lose their privileges under him? [He even campaigned on eliminating faith-based initiatives](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/05/obama.faith.based/) but after the backlash following his election he was forced to backtrack and reinforce the initiative with a "faith office". On top of that, don't forget him trying to get catholics to pay for birth control...  [hes trolling catholic church hospitals these days](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/health/policy/obama-administration-says-birth-control-mandate-applies-to-religious-groups-that-insure-themselves.html). I'm certain that even slightly religious people would have more "respect" for people of faith and their autonomy. 

Obama has supported gay-rights [WHOLEHEARTEDLY](http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2007/12/11/the_obama_questionnaire/
) since 1996 AT LEAST

No one in politics or academia believes him; Even people with different views don't believe him:

[Chris Hitchens](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITsYUjv_aEA), [Richard Dawkins](http://www.theblaze.com/stories/richard-dawkins-barack-obama-probably-is-an-atheist-lincoln-kennedy-clinton-too/), [Ann Coulter](http://www.mediaite.com/tv/ann-coulter-on-the-other-obama-rumor-hes-not-muslim-hes-an-atheist/), [Lawrence Krauss](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-Lk7gHEfK4), [Pat Buchanan](http://townhall.com/columnists/patbuchanan/2012/02/21/creators_oped/page/full/), [Franklin Graham](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/21/franklin-graham-questions-obama-romney-on-christian-faith/), [Pat Roberson](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/robertson-warns-of-looming-secular-atheist-dictatorship), [Bill Maher](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/01/13/bill_mahers_campaign_prediction_obama_will_come_out_as_an_atheist.html), [Penn Jillette](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJGxVeQw3SE feature=player_embedded) etc. All of them think hes faking it. Hardcore christians and hardcore atheists.

He also campaigned on getting religion out of hiring practices: http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20082217-503544.html

He's the first president to acknowledge non-believers: http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-01-20-obama-non-believers_N.htm
 
Now you want info on Jeremiah Wright? Obama probably only distantly knew the guy. He had to more than likely only show up for appearances to make him seem like he was in touch with the community. 

Here is a point we need to talk about... Jeremiah Wright was caught saying "god damn america"...[but you really don't understand what he was getting at.](http://www.timwise.org/2008/03/of-national-lies-and-racial-amnesia-jeremiah-wright-barack-obama-and-the-audacity-of-truth/) He was saying how utterly fucked up this country has been to minorities. Its true. You can deny it all you want, but he was highlighting a truth, albeit emotionally. He just wanted to say that America should really recognize their ways if they want to embrace Obama. Its kinda that "hey, they don't like me? well damn them!" Jeremiah Wright is not racist. Not at all. But you have to remember the bias white/right-wing america feels to anyone who talks about [white priviledge](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3812249801848706206) or exposes their messed up of institutionalized racism, so of course the clip was crazy. [Obama had to throw him under the bus to move on](http://articles.cnn.com/2008-03-18/politics/obama.transcript_1_perfect-union-constitution-slavery?_s=PM:POLITICS).

Black churches are the greatest source of networking in most urban communities, especially if black leaders are known to attend. Its all a game. I know in ~~Atlanta~~ every major city with a sizable minority population that many times, elected black officials only show up to church in times of election or when they need community support. They adopt a church home only to show their relation to the community. Its all for show. They have to connect with the people some how. Thats what a "representative" (in his case Senator) does.


Name a president who says this in his inaugural speech: 

    *"We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, and* ***nonbelievers.*** *We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth."*

He's already the negro, kenyan, socialist, communist, anti christ, who hates America.


Why throw people another bone to hate him for?

Few links outlining many inconsistencies in his "faith":

Here he is making fun clinging to guns and religion: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTxXUufI3jA


There is even a new biography that tackles his introduction to christianity and it sounds...[forced at best](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2018326327_apusobamabook.html): 

**And to cap it off, here is a section from "The Audacity of Hope". Start in the middle of p.198p.206 http://lnk.co/KPZUD . If that doesn't scream "faking it" to you, I don't know what will.**

 First of all theres no indication...NONE it causes you to be "violent"

I'm sure the 400+ years of slavery and essentially reluctance from the government to stop terrorizing black people barely 50 years ago which is barely 2 generations MIGHT have something to do with it.

Goddamn.

You can criticize a movement without feeling like you're being attacked.

Grow the hell up son.  




 Bigots like me?

LOL

I asked you to not compare the right to live, with the right to get married. 

Thats all I asked you to do.

I can't be a bigot for supporting gay marriage in all of its forms.

But you need to understand that these are completely separate issues. 




 I'm not a homophobe.

But if you can't understand how FIGHTING BEING LYNCHED and FIREBOMBED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR BREATHING AIR is different from gays wanting to get married...then you're lost. 

I'm an agnostic-atheist and I support the rights of gays getting married.

But don't expect me to compare the two.

let gay marriage stand on its own two feet.

There are tons of non-religious people who are against the idea as well.  




 Money has nothing to do with this?

Are you serious?

You think Freddie Gray WANTED to be selling crack? 




 Why do you assume they are? I didn't say so. 




 What hypocrisy am I exhibiting when I said i'm

1. An atheist

2. Support gay rights 




 I'm. Not. Religious. 

What the hell is your problem? 

And gay marriage is NOT the same as an interracial marriage from the 1960s. 

You can't keep ignoring the whole heterosexual thing then say "its the same"

Its LITERALLY different. 

I support gays getting married, but do NOT compare what black people in the USA fought and died for with gay marriage.e

Do NOT do it.  




 They're different because interracial marriage still presumed heterosexual interaction.  


































 A running total anywhere or social media? 

It would be interesting to compare the impacts 







































 I'm legitimately serious.

I don't see any other politician right now with his track record of success or national appeal who might be able to come close within the state. 

Or Governor? 









 We can argue that he has had some questionable policies and decisions, but his personal life is pretty much as clean as you can ever ask a politician's to be.

I mean, if Obama had ever done so much as taken an extra candy bar, he'd be on the front page and barred from running for POTUS. 

Its just weird seeing the Clintons back in the ring knowing how much dirt they have on themselves.

 minimize?

hersch has done good work here, but you're acting like you learned a significant amount of information for that 10,000 word article.

Again...what changed here?

The SEALs didn't get into a massive shootout?

OBL didn't have a gun on him?

So?  




  That's a silly argument: up until very recently, "Western values" were decidedly anti-gay.

I didn't make it up

You have to understand this.

Gays and gay rights are seen as intrusions of western values and virulently opposed. You have to remember how skeptical a lot of these places are to any sort of outside influence, especially culturally at this point. ***To them***, being anti-gay is a positive aspect of their society. 


Because they've been taught to feel that. People who are raised without the hatred, who have gay couples in their lives, do not feel "viscerally uneasy" in the slightest. The idea that people are born with hatred or "disgust" for same-sex interactions is utterly absurd.

I didn't say they were or were not taught anything. I'm telling how things are in different parts of the world.

You're not going to get anywhere by just thinking hitting over the head with your value systems will work without understanding why they're so stubborn to listen to you in the first place. So yeah, a lot of straight people aren't just drawn to images of gay people "being gay"...No matter how many gay people they have in their family or interact with. This isn't even about tolerance. Its about things you see that bother you. And a lot these cultures haven't had the references to understand how to view things they disagree with without respectfully disagreeing with it. Their answer is brutal repression and not tact or tolerance. Tolerance isn't something you find in 3rd world countries who can't even find the tolerance to fix their communities and solve overarching problems.  




 It doesn't run any "counter story"

It says the government struggled coming up with the finer details they wanted to release and that pakistan may have known about the raid itself

Big whoop

This isn't even that big of a revelation...unless they said OBL died in 1999 or something 




 **Do you really not understand this?**

Step outside if the ivory tower of liberal academia and step into the real and visceral world outside of your 1st world trappings

These people just HATE gays. 

It has nothing to do with their insecurity. It has everything to do with religiosity and flat out disgust of gay people

Hell, most heterosexual people I know don't *love* gays...they tolerate them in the sense that "it doesn't bother me" and they don't want them to be persecuted. Most heterosexuals I know just generally ignore it. But that doesn't mean they enjoy watching two dudes kiss or anything. It does viscerally make people feel uneasy. But thats besides the point. 

We're talking about cultures that haven't even secure the basics yet in the modern world...that are hyper-masculine (as a function of survival) and see any threat to the masculinity and thus perceived strength of their people as an utter and vile threat to the greater good. 

This has NOTHING to do with secretly being gay.

This has NOTHING to do with being insecure with your sexuality. 

Theres a reason the world map looks like this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory

Most of the world really does not value western ideals and rejecting homosexuals is seen as tossing off the weight of "liberalism" and "secularism" in these very traditional and insular cultures and communities.

Does this mean you have to agree?

No.

But it DOES mean that you'll have to do A LOT better in coming up with quick one-word responses to anything a "homophobe" (and gays need a better word than homophobe to be honest) has to say with respect to gay rights.  




  If you define islam by its extremists, then yes, it is islam.

I can't hand you a physics book and ask you to be a *moderate* about it 




  I ask why and he tells me because it is only "gay" if you are the one receiving or fall in love with the man. 

Thats fascinating  




 Same with Russia now 




 Actually, its not.

People just actually hate gays...and they don't see it as it having no effect on their lives. They see it as something they reject and want to not have to deal with it. I'm not a homophobe or anything so this doesn't bother me, but if you don't understand how they think or why they think it, you'll forever be confused. 

There are lazy arguments about AIDS and pedophilia and general visual discomfort in viewing gays in public that pervade all anti-gay societies around the world

Not every person who hates gays craves gay sex. Its stupid to even think that.  




 Did you even read Seymour's article?

We're bickering over stuff that isn't even that big of a deal!

OK. How many people were in the room? How many bullets we're fired? Did Pakistan know or not?

Who cares?

1. A raid happened

2. Bin Laden Died

3. US Intel led up the manner

The gist of the story is still the same. 









 Honestly, these "lies" aren't even lies.

I don't even see what the big deal is 




 So? 




 Yet this hasn't even come out. So whats really the big deal?

Clearly the Seal team had some answers for us since they had a convenient accident a short time later.


SEAL Teams have hundreds of members and train all the time.  




 Actually, the details aren't even that different.

Calling it a "lie" is ridiculous.

We're just discussing the color of the tablecloth at this point 




 Fabulous  




 OR...he just hates gays. 

You gotta stop thinking people who hate gays secretly crave penis 




 **We should abandon this notion that anyone who hates gays is therefore secretly gay**.

Is it true in many cases? Absolutely.

But there is a culture within Africa and ex-colonial states around the world (partly due to colonialism) that views western social values as vestiges of oppression and colonialism and emasculation...and anti-homosexuality is seen as an effort to regain a sense of confidence and stability in society. I  have heard the arguments too ranging from "The greeks brought homosexuality to africa" and "gays keep AIDS around" and the very common "gays aren't real men"...and you have to understand that these are just people who are trying to deal with the basics in life (the average citizen) and having to then conform to these notions of gender and try to maintain a degree of tolerance while doing so is VERY difficult. 

I'm not saying its right, but you have to understand this. It goes far beyond secretly "hating yourself"  




 The same one that used to stop black progress? 




 I'm just as much a nihilist as you...but really?

You might as well criticize how money works...or anything really. 
























 Its so funny when data comes out the way you don't like it, then it must be some OTHER cause.

Black men have been dumped on by the US in extraordinary ways and it seems Reddit can't handle it 














  the CIA/federal government wasn't exactly interested in upholding global white supremacy. 

LOL

Do you KNOW who J Edgar is? 




 Do you not know what the beef between allopathy and osteopathy is? 




 Do you want to ignore how racist the US has been?

Then pretend its not a factor? 




 You're really naive.  




 Deepak Chopra is hiring 









  transcendent minds.

This phase isn't going to help you win this discussion  




 Just 2 inches at a time bro. Everyone does it 

 #3232;_ #3232; 




 Its LITERALLY the same thing 




 what whistle was blown here?  














 Just look at some of the blog posts on there.

This guy is insane 









 You might as well just pick up some random snacks at your local drug store 




 Would him being 78 have something to do with it?

I'm sensing a bit of a Linus Pauling syndrom here... 




 *This spring I contacted Durrani and told him in detail what I had learned about the bin Laden assault from American sources: that bin Laden had been a prisoner of the ISI at the Abbottabad compound since 2006; that Kayani and Pasha knew of the raid in advance and had made sure that the two helicopters delivering the Seals to Abbottabad could cross Pakistani airspace without triggering any alarms; that the CIA did not learn of bin Ladens whereabouts by tracking his couriers, as the White House has claimed since May 2011, but from a former senior Pakistani intelligence officer who betrayed the secret in return for much of the $25 million reward offered by the US, and that, while Obama did order the raid and the Seal team did carry it out, many other aspects of the administrations account were false.*


#So whats the problem here?  














 Why wouldn't they be? Do you think the internet is just for non-government employees? 




 See...I trust them on foreign issues...but domestically I just laugh.  




 This is gonna get REAL interesting... 









 Yes.

Wtf is going on? 




 Except, it didn't

Zimmerman picked a fight. 

Lost

Then shot the guy kicking his ass.  




 Lets ask Trayvon... 




 I don't understand how you look at yourself in the mirror and think zimmerman's story holds up that travyon attacked him 




 Theres no evidence he was ambushed outside of him starting whatever fight that occurred.

No teenage boy I know who is on the phone with a girl making a run to the corner store will stop to engage in fisticuffs.  




 Thug?

You mean Zimmerman? 




 This is precisely why I truly believe Trayvon did NOT start that damn fight. It makes no sense.

Yes. Zimmerman lost that fight initially and shot Trayvon...but I've never seen a situation like this before.  




 Where are their fathers? 




 Putin's gonna ice this dude 




 anything in the city is consistently minimum 250/night

Unless you want to shack up in either a 4-star hotel asking 300+/night or end up on a ring highway  




 Thugs. 




 I mean...REALLY? 

Is demand that high or do you just love gouging people for the hell of it?

 









 Go.  




 I hope everyone would already know this 




 Could easily be a book or movie 







































 Yep. This is how Tamir Rice got killed. 




 This is precisely how/why Tamir Rice got killed 




 he's apparently really active still. He was the one who revealed Apple and Google were recording location data 5 years ago 




 The hacker is the one behind: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samy_(computer_worm) 














 BTW before this video was released, the friends of the man who got shot was a victim...not the perpetrator 

https://youtu.be/pBso7E__Y68

They lied about EVERYTHING 









 Theres 1.5 billion muslims 




 Nice statistically insignificant anecdote 




  There are sects of Islam where effigies of Mohammad are fine

name one. 




 Understatement 




 Do they not have any Persian art? 














 Redban. Is. An. Idiot. 




 Great Episode 









 It DID however put one suspect on probation for trying to go to a terrorist training camp 5 years ago.

You can't arrest someone with pre-crime e.g. "you're going to jail because we think you'll try and kill infidels 5 years from now" 




 Why isn't it possible for ISIS to have done this?

1. muslims get mad at mohammed pics

2. young angry muslims see whats going on online and want to join in

3. just so happens one of the suspects was being tracked by the feds for trying to go to an overseas camp.... 




 The NSA is getting so saturated with data that it's become useless for actually stopping, avoiding and lowering the essential reason it was created for: terrorism/acts of violence in America.

This isn't true.

See, predicting crime is hard unless you truly catch someone in the act. In Texas last week, the problem was that one of the suspects was already on probation essentially for being tracked to going overseas to train at a camp...but you can't arrest someone for suspicion of committing an terrorist act in the future.  




 ISIS as an islamic jihadist mindset predicates itself on worldwide domination

By asserting that they're "present" it helps them recruit.  




 How is this a conspiracy? Is it unreasonable young angry muslim men  live in the US? 









  How much would that cost?

Doesn't matter. 









 Sure 




 Ask it to tell you which planes are overhead  




 How is he wrong?

These young men aren't posting benign content to their Facebook pages.  




 Wouldn't it save us SO much more in the long run just to send a message of unity and progress and remove all of these bureaucratic barriers if we didn't have to focus on these meaningless boundaries? 




 Its SO frustrating.

ATL could AT LEAST resemble Boston. DC if we were ambitious. 

But no.

They CONTINUALLY stand in the way of literal progress in the metro area. 

This is why I suggest ATL just cannibalize everything inside 285 and be done with it.  




 It was supposed to go out to freaking GRIFFIN

 




 The Hawks are arguably the most innovative in the league in terms of fan -experience 









 He probably helped build a few of them 




 See, this is why NO policy changes are made.

None.  









 This is HARD! 




 Brilliant 









 You can't really blame him. Thats what consulting and private equity tends to do. 




 Sounds like Mitt Romney 




  I should have the right to do any drug I damn well please as long as doing so doesn't effect anyone else. 

drug use, regardless has absolute public health implications  




 He's cleaned up the streets though. His record doesn't lie.  




 People wouldn't poke fun if muslims weren't so quick to get mad 




 What is islamophobia?
