 Vonnegut is gute. 




 I love the dance.  




 Harry Potter. Movies came out well lined up to actual grade levels. 




 I read the first one... that's as far as my criticism goes. 




 I liked it because it mirrored some events in my life in a way I had never seen written before. Its long as shit though. 




 Why? 









 I read 2/3 of World War Z when I stopped. It was a fun book, but at the time I was not really reading much so I told myself "Good book, glad I read it." and then i acted like i read the whole thing. 




 Interested in which other of his novels you will read, I myself just finished "Mother Night" and it was the most different of his works. I recommend you read his second best book Cats Cradle (after Sirens of Titan)  




 Started my first Hemingway novel this morning, "The Sun Also Rises". I find it amazing how similar life in 1920's Europe can be to life in modern America. Good book so far. 




 It would be great if I never end up getting very sick, but sadly I most likely  will one day. If I somehow end up reaching a very old age and I cam still stand then I guess I'll read the Dark Tower 




 I don't think anyone considers the PoA film to be bad, its actually one of the better directed ones.  




 I had read order of the phoenix about two weeks within its release and I loved it. School librarian actually set it aside for me. Then when HBP eventually came out, I got spoiled :/ the big spoiler.

didn't read it until years later about a couple months after the fifth film came out. Completely rekindled my love in the series and I read deathly hallows immediately after. I read it again, and I think its my favorite, either 6,5, or 3. 


chamber of secrets was always my least favorite.   




 I have the first four "Gunslinger" Stephen King novels waiting on my bookstand just in case I ever break my leg or get stuck in bed for a long while, I actually don't plan on reading them on my spare time. They are just those just in case books. So what book or series are you saving for the just in case? 




 I just finished "The Road" tonight at 1 am after starting at about 9pm and taking a thirty something minute break at the hundred page milestone. So about 3.5 hours for a 287 page novel. Book was amazing btw, I've had my copy for at least five years and I've attempted starting it twice, getting only to the thirtieth page or so, so I challenged myself tonight to just read the fucking book. Really glad I did, book has entered my top ten.  




 Me too. Libertarianism is an ideology I just don't understand. Civilization is something that time itself has proven to be necessarily governed.  




 I've read very little Sci fi in my life, barely Sci fi actually, just Kurt Vonnegut's work and The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, as you can see I'm more into the light stuff, but I would like branching out. I don't want something too far fetched and I don't want anything military.

any SciFi novels out there that are serious in tone but do not revolve around a military, or a space soldier? 




 ----" The Stranger" Spoilers----- 

I realized that enough time has passed since 10th grade and that I needed to re-read "The Stranger" by Albert Camus. Since I've been reading some Vonnegut lately, I was kind of shocked by how cold Meaursault is in The Stranger, I had been getting accustomed to lively characters, and hilarious narraration so the change of pace took some getting used to. 


"The Stranger" is a very short book, only 120 pages long, so I read it all in one sitting. Interestingly as I read it I kept jumping back in my mind to when I was still in 10th grade, sitting in that class as we discussed in our own little mini trial whether the murder was premeditated or if Mersault had any possible defense. 


I don't reread novels, I feel as if once is good enough, but I'm starting to realize I was wrong. Maybe rereading a book is in a way being in two places of time at once, the first time, and then the now. Or maybe I've just been reading too much Vonnegut and I'm starting to not see time as linear. 




 They're both dead 




 This is now a thing I'll do for the rest of my life. You just saved my life.  




 Lone Survivor is a recent smaller budget film by him that is good.  




 Wish I read this about 3 years ago. 




 It was a really large closet, biggest I ever seen.  




 Not exactly a robbery, more like a breaking and entering. It was a just sold home in my ex girlfriends neighborhood, and it was pretty easy to get in. We go in and look around the house, have sex in the closet, no furniture yet, and then she finds a panini maker inside the kitchen cupboard. We decide to take it. Then I raid the fridge and find four coronas, and we proceed to sit there by ourselves in a strangers new home and drink their beer all sweaty post sex. Months later she breaks up with me. We never told our friends about our little breaking and entering. Sucks that one of my favorite life memories was with someone I never want to see again. 

She kept the panini maker. 
 




 Are you out there typing up code in multiple languages, or do you seldom even use a computer at the workplace? 




 Quentin Tarantino

David Fincher

Ben Affleck 

Paul Thomas Anderson

Zach Snyder 




 Movie made me scream. Needs to be higher on the list. It's a Sam Mendes film correct? 




 You two should become friends 




 I bought the 20 anniversary edition last week. Haven't stopped listening.  




 I always accept fliers. It's so fuckin simple. Grab flyer. Walk ten feet. Read flyer. Throw flyer away.  




 Auditorium is my shit 




 I'm assuming from the thread title and all the other answers in here, that season 2 will be up on St Patricks day  




 Why you gotta say spic tho 




 Cartman. Fuck that fat kid. 


And fuck anybody that emulates his mannerisms.  




 I remember I listened to OBFCL2 first before any other Wu Tang solo project. I immediately got the first one right after this.  




 This is why Aquemini is my favorite Outkast album 




 I have a Vapor Shark and I love it. Store is constantly packed too. Any specific criticisms you hear about VS? 




 oh god 




 spitting on your onion rings 




 Its just "Say Goodbye to Hollywood". But, that's my favorite of his. 




 This movie is just sad. Was trying to watch all the of director's films, Sam Mendes, and I ended up watching this one. 

What the fuck. 
This isn't entertainment, this is isn't escapism. Only reason to watch this film is to make myself feel a little better of my own life. 

I'm sad and I fear marriage now.  




 Phone wallet keys.  

It's the ritual everytime I leave my house.  




 Is there a name for the phenomena of people forgetting how to drive? Sometimes traffic just stops.  




 Related: having to troubleshoot computer issues. I have broken a printer Office Space style before out of rage. Fuck computers 




 They're the worst.  




 Me, having plans fall through. 

If I'm looking forward to something all day, and it gets cancelled my whole day feels like a waste. I could've planned for something else.  









 Why do y'all douches always look so happy?  




 Is there a difference? I thought they usually meant the same thing 




 Hey man, if by douchiest car you mean something better than my year 2000 car... 




 Some people out there have to be at least mildly aware of their douchiness 




 Douchebags always seem like they're having a good time, so this is a question to all douchebags willing to admit it: What's awesome shit that happens to you because you're a douchebag? 




 Toxicity is an amazing album. Have you listened to it? 




 God that's gonna be a great game isn't it.  




 Safe House was pretty succesful film. Made $140 million domesticly. One of his largest films.  




 I love that album. My uncle had gifted me the bootleg when i was like 13.

Motivation is still my pump up song. 




 Buy something with it. Come on, you can afford it. Do something cool with the cash  




 I know, I do awesome things and Im broke. But I'm curious to see what a person with lots of funds does for fun.  









 Great book, first King novel I've ever read. That guy can fucking write.  




 They'll all find out... Soon.  




 I party occasionally, but when I do, I stay next to my friends the whole time. I don't really like meeting new people. 

That first moment when I walk into a party or place with a lot of people, I feel some anxiety, but it goes away if I'm close to my friends.  
























 And a Sci fy TV show! 




 The first E-reader I ever saw was a SONY. If they would have had their own online store like amazon theyd be king right now, 




 I read the first one and I liked it a lot. Gonna spread this series out for the next couple years. Great story. 




 Adam Sandlers a great dramatic actor. Reign over me was great too. 




 Yea I see everyone posting dudes, why not party with some hot chick?  




 That movie was way too stylized. I like Fincher more than Stone 




 Paul T Anderson: Stalker movie. All his films are about obsessive men, I would like to see him try a film with an obsessive female lead. 




 Quentin Tarantino with some space pirates and space cowboys? 
dooowwwnnnn 




 Two serial killers fall in love? 




 It's fantastic. Especially if you usually don't read. Most people don't have experience with multiple narrarators, and this book does it great
 




 I just got HBO GO. Don't think I'll watch any new tv series until I watch all of these.. 




 All my friends have tattoos. I'm the only one without one. How often do I have to hear " Bro when you gonna get some ink" . 


never. I don't care for writing on my skin.  




 Visceral? Are you a video game industry journalist? 




 As someone who was running errands all over Miami this morning, why?



Miami fucking sucks 




 Is there any system in place that forces a state to change its laws? Lets say all 49 other states make motorcycles illegal, but there's one state that allows motorcycles. Would the federal government step in and force that state to change its laws? Is there some sort of majority rule?  




 I live in Florida and we are behind the curve on many things, sometimes this state doesn't feel like America. Why cant all states be equal. 




 Would anyone on reddit know which, if any, branch is starving for recruits? 




 I have a marijuana possession misdemeanor back in 2012 that was nolle pros. I also have a couple traffic violations. I'm in college right now and have not gotten in trouble since the 2012 incident. Would any US branch grant me the necessary waiver? I really want to serve, any branch, any position.

I am 22 and in great physical and mental shape. No weed since I was busted. 
 









 While doing all this do I just block out everyone I know? I seriously don't enjoy anyone in life right now except maybe my sister and my dad. My mom is a huge factor in me wanting to leave. 


The military isnt an option because I am disqualified from enrolling because of a marijuana conviction. Right now they don't really need too many recruits so what could have easily been solved with a waiver in the past, now leads to a permanent DQ. 




 I'm tired of my friends, we don't really have the same interests anymore. I hate my mother. I'm bored of everything. I don't want to get a job, I don't ever want to have a boss again. I want to completely leave my life to start a new one. I have no money though. Are there any programs besides the military that allow me to leave home and have a purpose?

 




 Good site, very little matches in my city tho. I'll check it periodically though thank you. 




 Thank you 




 Unlikely or impossible? 




 Three years ago I made the mistake of getting caught with marijuana. I have a misdemeanor charge on my record, I can expunge it. I dream of being an Air Force Loadmaster. By next April I will have an Associates degree. What are my chances of getting a waiver? Does the Air Force need Loadmasters right now?  




 Because I have a misdemeanor drug charge the US military is not an option for me, but I really want to enlist into something and serve somehow. I was looking at the PeaceCorps, and I've read that getting in is a little hard. I'm currently working on getting my degree, so Ill have that requirement met, but one thing i have little to none is Volunteer service. How do I start? Does any one here volunteer? 




 Do you do the same psychedelics or do you experiment with different kinds? For a while, about a year ago, I would try anything I could get my hands on, and I dont recommend that. 




 There's no dependency, but its very hard to say no to drugs or alcohol when I'm bored. 




 Anyone gone fully sober after having experienced drugs and alcohol? Was it hard? Was it worth it? 




 FAVORITE: Open roads at some times, very peaceful driving.
Least favorite: Every thing is far, so walking is never an option. 




 If you already live an active lifestyle it would be beneficial to your activities to attain more strength. Being out there and being and feeling stronger is very fun. 




 At my old job people a brave soul made it known to everyone that they smoked weed, and then since everybody fucking smoked weed anyways, people started meeting up to get high. I already have a group of friends i do that with, so I only smoked with the  coworkers a handful of times. All those people ended up becoming like best buddies. 




 Working out is the best thing for the body. Unless science advances exponentially in the coming years, you're going to be stuck inside your body for the rest of your life. Might as well make it the best body possible. Join a gym or workout at home its all up to you. I started just doing body weight exercise, just to have some strength, and eventually I wanted more strength and joined a gym. Amazing decision that has left me feeling and looking great. 




 I am single right now and it doesnt bother me at all. I was in a relationship for 13 months after having been single for a longtime, and that relationship taught me a lot of things. Lesson one: date someone better than yourself. I dated a girl that had all the same issues in life i had and then some. We constantly were having issues because neither of us had our shit together. Just fucking kids being kids. I plan on being single until i have my shit together. ETA for having my shit together, at least 10 months.  




 Oh wow, thank you! 




 Thank you that's exactly what I was looking for. Best subreddit for that type of trading? 




 Not exactly day trading, but buying some and selling within a week or two, is there a name for that? 




 I guess its called a film producer, but I want to be the guy that reads scripts and decides what gets made, and how large of a budget the film needs.  




 I'm going to another city next weekend, don't want to spend money until I'm there. 




 I'm anti-people, not anti-person. I would be able to feel well in a crowded room only if I got one on one time with every single person there. But when its not one on one, the persons become people. 




 Cookies and cream of course! Just hearing the words ice and cream makes me think of cold pieces of Oreo. 




 Thank you so much for this reply. I really do want to get my degree. 




 Man of Steel had the best action sequences ever in a superhero film.  




 I was for three weeks, until last week when my small set of funds became  $100. I haven't been looking for work because I really want to focus on school, but my parents are making it difficult on me to just focus on school. I already set my school schedule for fall and I'm not really going to have much free time for a job. But my parents keep asking me about my job situation. Ahhh, I'm going to attempt to get a student loan in the fall for some funds. To answer your question, right now at this moment I am happy. But when I leave this moment and place myself  in my near future I get slightly depressed, I fear that I might have to drop a class or two and het a job. 


Not one semester of college have I gone through where I could focus just on school. 




 Homestead FL. The most "southern" town in south fl. What do I like to do here? Drive north. 




 I was thinking about being a server, I did food industry for a year so I thought I had kind of graduated from that, but tips are just so gratifying. Hmmm 




 I'm in college, age 21. 




 I'm going to give the short version of the story: I was a cashier at a sporting goods store for two years and it was really fun, but in the last of month of my employment, work just started becoming a chore. The store manager was getting on my nerves, and a lot of the new employees were boring. The day before I quit I put in a request to get a weekend off, two months in advance, and then I get a text from a coworker that my store manager looked at the request and then in huge letters wrote denied. Her reason was that we had inventory that week. I confronted her about this because it was bullshit. Inventory was on a Tuesday or Wednesday and I was requesting the fri-sun off. She gave me a lot of bullshit and said "well see what we can do". The whole time I tried having this conversation with her she paid me about three percent attention. The next day I accidentally, or maybe subconsciously, woke up 5 minutes into my shift. I felt relief. My mind literally had no urge to go into work. I went to the gym, ate something and then drove to the job, looked for my manager and I told her I quit.


problem is I don't have any income anymore. But at least I don't have to deal with my manager anymore. 




 Guessing the requirements are being white and rich. 




 A drama about high school football in texas/the south. Down there footballs serious business. I lasted two seasons, felt too dramatic. But the first season is worth watching. 




 Just have a Monster hunter be the protagonist for all the films. He has a zany twisted mad scientist friend who's not good with women as his best friend, this friend allows them to travel in time finding monsters.  




 I just hope the opening scene is the same from the first Uncharted game.  




 Nothing was the same, literally 




 Smiles, I would shoot myself in the face with it, and everyone else I meet. 




 Need to watch this one again. 




 Oh yes, love Collateral. 




 Wonderful film, felt like if I was in NYC. Would like to watch more like this. 




 "Barrel of the Planet of the Apes" 




 The correct nomenclature is "apes" 




 I don't agree with your predictions at all. No way is the sequel to a movie that had long legs and great word of mouth going to open less than the first. 




 Sequel to be titled "War of the Planet of the Apes" 




 For a non superhero movie with a mostly CG cast? 
























 This might be his masterpiece, but Se7en is still my favorite. Zodiac has a limited number of rewatches, Se7en I can watch whenever. 




 Ok I'm sorry 




 No wonder so many Leon medical centers have sprung up lately 




 Gonna read this. Had never heard of it. 




 I like to imagine the setting myself. Unless its incredibly important to the story, can't the reader just infer from the situation where the  characters are? 




 I read The Road this year after having attempted it a couple years ago. I loved it. I don't know if to read Blood Meridian or No Country For Old Men because Ive already seen the movie. How similair is it to the movie? 




 c-cc-c-c-c-c-c-cccombo breaker. Shits not chill at all 




 Link? 




 Yea, only drink I get when I go there. 




 The book was. Idk about the adaption. 




 No, a major plot point is that hes getting older, so I would recommend watching it at least a week after the others. Preferably three years after. 




 Fun fact, Quantum of Solace is the most expensive film ever by the  minute. It was just a really expensive epilogue to Casino Royale.
edit. wrong word 




 Cats Cradle is my favorite of his, followed by Sirens of Titan.  




 Michael Chabon "Wonder Boys" enjoying it a lot.
Ernest Hemmingway "Farewell to Arms", taking my time with this one, perfect breakfast reading. 




 He runs a Nazi memorabilia shop. 




 Manhattan Love Story is surprisingly enjoyable and clever. 




 New Girl is hilarious, at least the first two seasons. You're just hating. 









 Your kid wins at Halloween 




 Literally watching "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" right now and I'm loving it. 




 Brad Bird outweighs Lindelof though, so who cares. 




 Holy shit me too. I was 12 or 13 and I had just got a TV in my room, I channel surfed until I hit upon HBO and a movie was about to start. I said why not, and Collateral happened. It was my favorite movie for a long time. 




 You speak Arabic? Sounds like you can definitely get a good job 




 You already saw the whole joke. 




 I've been in six car accidents! Two ended up completely wrecking the car I was in.


Only four where my fault. 




 Just graduate. Senior year is young adult day care 




 I was so glad when the detailer gave me the option for AG. Forgot about tuition assistance... 




 I'm in DEP for Aerographers Mate, shipping out in 2015. Wondering what exactly goes down in the Navy when on shore duty. Everything on the internet is usually about sea duty. 




 Its the online sf86 




 I live in his home area, I hate how fucking thug and ignorant people can be down here. Career criminals are the worst, and more needs to be done in this country to help youths make better decisions. 




 High Grossers: Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson etc


Grown Ups cast: Adam Sandler, Cris Rock, Rob Schneider etc

New SNL cast: Andy Samberg, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Jason Sudeikis, Kristen Wiig etc


Appatow crew: Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, James Franco etc


Did I miss any? Who's your favorite? 




 Buy an ereader.

I have a Kindle Paperwhite and I now read 5 times more books. 




 Sirens of Titan and CatS Cradle are my favorites. Mother Night is my least favorite. 




 "Horns" by Joe Hill. I read "Heart Shaped Box" last week and enjoyed it very much so now I have to read his whole bibliography. I like that he seems to have grown up with the same pop culture I did, so I understand all the reference's he makes. Liking his style more than Kings. 




 I've seen The Mexican on TBS like 4 times in the last ten years. 




 Reddits not a waste of time though. Think of it as a free MMO community college with courses on any topic and where anyone can be teacher or student. If you reddit correctly you can learn a lot of stuff for free. 




 On a dead celebrity binge? 




 If you like Gone Girl you might as well read her two other novels, Sharp Objects and Dark Places. Both have female protagonists that seem real. 




 Do you recommend ET to someone who's never worked with electronics before?  




 Dark Places was good too 




 The Road. Its narrative and strange word choice made 17 year old me give up quick, until four years later when i gave it a second shot. Finished it in one night. Amazing novel. 




 God yes. I was utterly destroyed when an ex of mine three days after breaking up with me showed up on my feed as in a relationship. 




 Whenever a server asks me how much creme or sugar and I say none, I try to keep the coolest face I can


"look at that guy, he's a real man, not afraid of anything" 




 Black because I like tasting the coffee and not the creme.

Also, because I hope someone notices and thinks its cool.
 




 That's not what it means.
Its how high you are, not how much you smoked. 




 Expendables 4 




 They already did with Casino Royale 




 I only had a small injury on one of my fingers, but it was years ago. Vision and hearing are great too, and I am in very great physical shape.


I really cant wait until I'm swore in. I think about it all day. This wait is stressing me out.

Positive thoughts. 




 I took my asvab yesterday, all I need is my physical and a drug waiver now. So am I basically in? I hope so, I've been stressing it a lot. 




 I was thinking Batista 




 Damn gurl you normmmall.  Nam sayin 




 It was necessary to make more money, which is what the film industry is about.  




 Read Sirens of Titan, what I believe Hitchhikers to be based off of. 




 Read this book throughout a road trip. Its like the only thing I remember from the trip.  




 So you bought 4 shares? 




 WAIT WE HAVE THIS TECHNOLOGY? 




 I also want to know. I can only afford one. 




 Was Bling Ring good? I'll Netflix it if it is 




 The one with legal murder. 




 The Road and The Stranger. Not because they were great, they were, but because they're really short. 




 When a friend of mine fell for a pyramid scheme and knew it. His reasoning was that he knew he could make it to the top of the scheme if he signed other people up.
