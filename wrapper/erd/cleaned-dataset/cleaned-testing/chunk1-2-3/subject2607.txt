 My name is Anna Smith and I always get Anna Nicole Smith jokes. "Is your middle name Nicole???" No. It's not. 









 "In My Life" has been one of my favorite songs my whole life because I grew up on Beatles. Then my dad passed away when I was 13 and they played that at his funeral and it was the sweetest thing ever. Especially because he got me into The Beatles. It still makes me think of him to this day and that's why I still love the song so much. 




 My dad used to send me these for the few birthdays of mine that he spent in prison. They were all really cute, my favorite was a Super Mario Brothers one. The artwork was exactly the same too, I would think it was made by the same guy. 




 I didn't tell my dad he loved him a week before he OD'd and the last time I talked to him. That's the only time I didn't after a phone call. I was with my friends and thought I was too cool to talk to him. 









 In 8th grade I went all winter without wearing an actual winter coat once. I just wore hoodies. And I walked a mile and a half home from school everyday. AND I live in Michigan. 




 I'm like 3 minutes in to it right now. What am I watching. 




 My high school marching band is playing How Far We've Come for our halftime show and we came up with this really funny dance to it. Not really a question just though I would tell you. I LOVE your music. 




 Well yeah. Our reputation is crap too, I'm sure. :P 




 Yeah I live in Waterford if you know where that is so our reputation isn't much better 




 I live really close to Bloomfield Hills and you guys are known as being really stuck up and pretentious. Not that it's anything near as bad as what Mitt Romney is. Where I live is probably considered really ghetto and/or redneck so. 




 Heh. I get it. I'm gonna message you now. Yeah. 




 Little bit, little bit. This is why we can't have nice things. 




 I actually had a suspicion that you were MY friend Jimmy. But I wasn't sure.  http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/200/296/Waht%20a%20twist.jpg 




 I'm sorry bro *virtual hugs* That's gotta suck. We both kinda sound like we're in the same boat. This guy asked out a girl about 2 or 3 weeks ago and she dumped him after twelve hours and to my knowledge, he's still single. The fact that she dumped him so fast kinda made me smile. Karma, ya know? I'd be a lot less upset with him if he didn't completely cut me off after he promised he didn't want to hurt me but he had to do it because he felt he would have ended up hurting me by the time even worse if we had kept dating. Which sounded like bull to me. and we could be friends. Really, whenever I tried to make things right or talk to him he ignored me and recently deleted me off Facebook. He also kissed another girl near the end of our relationship because they were both going through hard times but he said it didn't mean anything and I didn't find out til about 2 days after our breakup. Sorry I didn't mean to turn that into a rant. But message me sometime dude.3 Feel better. 




 I like to put my iPod on shuffle, recline my seat a little bit, and lay there with my eyes closed and listen to my iPod for hours, or until I fall asleep. I make this rule for myself where I can't skip any songs and I have to listen really hard to the music that is playing. 




 Mr. Blue Sky - Electric Light Orchestra

Drive - Incubus

With a Little Help From My Friends - The Beatles 




 You sound like the coolest guy ever though omfg marry me right here, right now. 




 I wish I knew this going into my last relationship. Really. My SO and I broke up well over a month ago and I'm still so upset about it, and he already moved on. 




 Oh god... 




 I just saw him Wednesday near Detroit and it was great. He's touring with Christina Perri and she is great as well. They're both awesome live and have great stage presence. Jason is very friendly. You'll have a great time. Any questions just ask (: 




 I actually still braid my hair before bed in two braids so it looks kinda of crimped to be honest 




 Haha, I'll drop you a message sometime! :) 




 No. But we did go extremely far on multiple occasions. I'm not gonna say details but it's not much better .-. 




 Thanks! Every week I'm better than I was the week before. So I'm definitely feeling so much better than I did to begin with and I've moved on quite a bit. And yeah you shouldn't pressure anyone for sex. It just ruins things. Wait until you're ready. c: 




 Crappy music in general. I have a "Disney channel stars" station on my Pandora Radio that I listen to regularly... 




 One of my teachers had a big piece of wood shaped like a bass and painted really nicely and it said "Bathroom bass" on it, like "Bathroom Pass" I thought it was kinda cute 




 Yeah I know. I'm not proud. I know it's not an excuse but I was pressured. And the thing is he promised we'd still be friends and that he didn't want to hurt me. Yet he ignores all communication I try to make with him and deleted me off facebook the other day. ;-; 




 How physically far I went with my ex boyfriend. He was my first real relationship and I thought it would last but he dumped me out of he blue one day and moved on while I was still at home crying and listening to Taylor Swift. If I could go back to that day I would have stopped right when it started getting out of hand. 




 I have never liked a guy that wasn't a huge nerd. Really, like I could never date a guy that wasn't nerdy. I have a thing for glasses and curly hair too. And not the "hot nerd" the "nerd nerd" 




 This reminds me of a time me, my mom, and my grandmother were at Disney World. I was about 11 at the time and we were on one of the Disney busses and we were sitting across from two twin boys who were maybe about six or seven years old. They were being obnoxious and screaming and acting like idiots, and at the exact same time me and my grandmother went "SHHH!!!" The kids were dead silent the rest of the ride. 




 My school's marching band is doing How Far We've Come, Yesterday, and Thnks fr the mmrs for the half time show 




 Reversing roles for me. Trying to be friends with ex-BF. Not going well for me. 




 That's exactly what I said. He kissed another girl. They were both having rough times. It was an impulse. I can forgive him. But I'm never gonna forget what he did and how much it hurt me. 




 Wow. Thank you. Really. I'll definitely try that. I guess that's all I need. Some time away, just to act a little reckless. Again, thank you bro. Really helpful. c: 




 My favorite member is probably Paul, because he's extremely talented and I think he has an amazing personality. My favorite album is a hard one, but I have to say Rubber Soul. My favorite Song is In My Life because it brings back a lot of fond memories of my father who passed away last year. My favorite singer is John. I love the Beatles because their music is incredible and they had a huge impact on music history. The Beatles are who I turn to when there's no one else. They're just unbelievable. 




 Why? Just why? Who honestly thought this would be a good idea? 




 I actually really like the smell of skunk. I also love the smell of gasoline and smoke though, so people think I'm weird for that. 




 Thank you c: This is really nice and some of the best advice I've gotten. I have a best friend that has been there through the whole thing but I'm sure she's getting tired of hearing about it. Lol :P 




 I'm 14 years old and one month ago Saturday, my boyfriend (also 14) broke up with me. He said that he was under a lot of stress and was having family issues and that he didn't want to break up with me but he had to because he didn't want to end up hurting me. When he broke up with me, the both of us were just sobbing. Then fast forward about 3 days. I found out he kissed another girl who was raped recently while he was still with me. When I asked him about it, he said that I deserved to know the truth and he did but they were talking about what happened to her and they kissed without thinking, and he has no feelings for her and isn't dating her. I haven't tried talking to him since then and he hasn't tried talking to me, but today I broke and sent him a message on Facebook. It said "Hey, I know you're probably not really wanting to hear from me and idk if you're upset with me or anything but I've been kinda worried about you because of how you were last time we talked, and I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Are things going any better for you at all? /:" He didn't reply yet, but he hasn't been online and I just sent it about 5 hours ago. I was in tears for about the first week of our breakup, then the next two I was fine, and now I'm in pieces again. I saw a picture of him on facebook and legitimately started crying. This boy was my first kiss and my first real boyfriend. We went extremely far physically which is something I'm not proud of, but it's the past. We are going to different high schools this year as well, so I won't be able to see him during school either. I just miss him so much. I keep having dreams that I see him somewhere, and we make up, and everything is back to how it used to be. I just feel like I'm never going to get better. The only thing I want right now is to be able to see him and talk about things. I just need so much closure right now and I just want us to get back together and I want things to be how they used to be. I miss his smile, I miss cuddling with him while we listened to music, I miss Facetiming with him every single day for hours and hours. Reddit, how do I get over it? And should I keep trying to talk to him or should I back off? Thanks.

EDIT: Yeah. He didn't reply to my facebook message. It said that he saw it, but no reply. 




 DFW he says you can still be friends yet makes no effort to talk to you.  




 The reason my ex boyfriend kissed another girl during our relationship is because I was an OAG and even though he insists it wasn't my fault I will always know it was because I wouldn't give him space and assumed the whole relationship would be very long-term. 




 I actually love this. You have a pretty unique and cool sound. Keep it up. 




 Bill, I'm 14 years old and you are the reason I have so much passion for science. I want to major in physics some day. Thank you, you have made such a difference in my life. I probably never would have cared about science otherwise and never would have realized how cool it is. But my question is, what were you like as a teenager?

 I heard this song at the Apple store a while ago. I was trying the headphones on an iPod and this happened to be the song I chose. Been into it ever since. 




 This freaking song. Definitely my favorite on the album, kind of hard to listen to right now though because I just went through a rough breakup and he and I used to listen to this song together all the time. 




 I still read it as Jared until you pointed it out and was really creeped out as to why they would name it. 




 My username is relevant to this post. :'( 









 Oh my gosh, me too. I thought I was the only one. Mine don't sound nearly as strong as yours, but the word "fluffy" I'll think of a little retriever. For verbs I get a still image of someone doing the verb. For whatever reason, a lot of these images are cartoony and look a lot like clip-art. 




 Yes. But it depends on where I'm at and what's going on in my life. At the moment I gotta say it's Always Be My Baby (The David Cook version, I'm not a fan of Mariah Carey). I know that my boyfriend and I are more than likely going to end soon and I can't accept it. That song is describing my feelings down to every last word. 









 My cat was originally Mr. Kitty then we figured out it was a girl and it turned into Ms. Kitty and now it's just Kitty. :3 




 How is Qdoba actually pronounced? I know it's a dumb question but my mom and I were arguing about it. 




 I know that feel. My dog will run up and down the hallway and growl and bark at my grandfather's urn. And this is normally and extremely quiet dog. 









 I don't spend my 4th of July downstate but I'm in Waterford and I heard we have a pretty good fireworks show, but Lake Orion has a very nice one as well. If you're willing to travel I always go to one in East Tawas, it's about a 2 and a half hour drive. It's very nice, bright fireworks on Lake Huron. 




 I have glasses because I'm farsighted. I'm supposed to wear them all the time but I wear them occasionally during the evening while I'm reading or on the internet. I want contacts but I have to wait a little while to get the money. I just don't wear them all the time because I think they make me look extremely nerdy and I don't like them, so I know it's my fault. But my question is, how much worse can my vision get from not wearing them? Scare me into wearing them more often because I know I need to and would if I knew the risks of not wearing them.

 I actually like writing essays. Too bad I live in Michigan. I write essays in my spare time, come on Tigers. 




 Wow. This is gorgeous. I need to visit here sometime. 




 They can't be comprehended by the human mind. 




 "INTO THE DOME MOTHERFUCKER!"

Jesus Christ I have tears. 









 I actually should have called it Lake Huron, Ontario. I said Michigan because that's where I live and I'm used to it I guess. XD Sorry, broski 




 It is. I don't know why I put Michigan in the title. Probably because I live in Michigan. My bad, brethren. 









 I read "Found this baby" and I was instantly concerned. 





























 I'm considering getting a snake or a bearded dragon, but I have no idea where to start. I already have a cat and a small dog (who probably wouldn't care that much), and my cat will try to attack everything that moves. I'm surprised she hasn't gotten any of my fish yet, so my cat is a concern. I don't want to get anything that my cat could potentially harm. I'm sure I could find a weight or something to put on the cage, but I'd still worry. Anyhow, I live in a condo and I am gone for school everyday during the school year and my mom works. Our family also goes upstate a lot, sometimes for about a week at a time, so I would need something that would either be able to travel or that would be able to be alone for a few days. So I suppose my question is, what would be better for my situation: a snake or a bearded dragon? Also, if anyone recommends a snake, what kind? Any information at all would be appreciated, because I have no idea where to start. Thanks!3   




 Hell yeah3 




 I can't pick just one, but Knockin' on Heaven's door by Bob Dylan is in my top 3. It was played at my father's funeral, who was a huge Bob Dylan fan, and that makes it even sadder for me. 




 Thanks!

 This is why my mother refused to talk "baby talk" to me as a baby. I was also talking in full sentences substantially faster than most babies, whether or not that has anything to do with it. 




 I absolutely love McCrae and have a giant obsession/crush on him tbh. I actually got really jealous about he and Amanda and I realized I needed to take a step back and reevaluate the fact that I'm getting jealous about a man I will never meet and has no idea who I am. Oh my god. 




 God this is gorgeous. I love living in Michigan. I never want to leave. 




 Yeah at this point it should pretty much be underwater-ford 




 Waterford. Represent! 




 Just finished that book, my immediate thought as well 




 You're welcome(: 




 D'aww you're a cutie :3 




 Woo! Message me!(: 




 Hell yeah! 




 Trombone!3 




 You get me. 




 I have been playing guitar for about 3 years, since I was 12. I started trombone in October, and I've played euphonium/baritone since I was 11. I love music, I swear sometimes it's the thing that keeps me sane. 









 As weird as it sounds, I LOVE your eyebrows. 




 http://imgur.com/upsFs0L

The top one was from when I was two, circa 2000, and the other two are from now, 10th grade. I was a cutie :3 (btw excuse the no makeup but yeah) 




 Ouch. I take it you guys are competitive. We don't technically compete, except for at certain parades and invitationals. 




 Depending on how much we need to work on, usually 2-5 hours. Most of the time it's about 3. 5 hour practices only happen about once or twice a season. 




 True that. 




 Before camp it's at 10 am, after camp it's 1 pm, during the school year it's 6:30 pm 




 I still have school tomorrow :( my internal clock wakes me up at 6, then right when I can start sleeping in, marching band starts. The struggle. 




 That is a good point. I guess I'm just really bitter about them considering selling it. 




 If the city does end up selling that art, I'm going to be so pissed off you have no idea. We all know that if they were to end up getting the money from selling the paintings, then in five years they're going to end up exactly where they are now, unless drastic changes occur  within the city council. 




 You could actually almost put this on r/creepy 




 I love the acoustic version so damn much.

 This is it, thanks! 




 I'm late, but I got a rather amazing boyfriend ;3 




 I watched a movie on Netflix a while back, and I just thought about it today. I can't remember for the life of me what it was called. It was about a guy who was a high school teacher or coach or something (if I'm not mistaken) and he has a very sarcastic son. I can't remember why, but the son ends up killing himself and his dad starts going crazy, and I remember at the end he saw his son hanging in the hallway. Sorry for the convoluted description, that's all I remember of it. Thanks!  




 http://imgur.com/vOq5BSr I'm the one on the right, I promise my teeth aren't really that yellow, just the lighting ;-; 




 You're adorable awwh 




 Same problem. I haven't had mine since around November or December. No one seems concerned and say that it's normal. THAT IS NOT FUCKING NORMAL. 




 Well he's really mean in a funny way, and he said that I should STOP breathing. Like all together. XD 




 I'm in segment 1. In Michigan you can start it at 14 and 9 months. 









 Check this website: http://zenpencils.com/ It's very possible, because the art style and context sounds similar to these. 




 Oh my gosh. The other day my high school had a girls lacrosse game against a school in Detroit, we encountered so many girls like this. They pretty much beat us with their sticks too. 




 I do water then paste, and no water on top. Maybe I'm too stupid to brush my teeth but when I do it the other way, the toothpaste all globs off. 




 I'm from Michigan and I definitely suggest filming in Alpena, especially on Long Lake. Parts of the town are gorgeous. 




 And then that cover is the only one you can find at wherever you buy it from and you look like an asswagon carrying it around? Yeah. The Hobbit and The Perks of Being a Wallflower. 




 I still wear acid wash jeans. I love them. 




 It's Franklin Press, not worth a whole lot. Oh well. 




 Ah, that's mildly disappointing. I'll check when I get home tomorrow. 




 I'll check tomorrow when I get home. :) 




 Will do tomorrow 




 Oh my gosh. Will do tomorrow when I get home. 









 Yup .-. 




 And there's the time she referred to my cousin's year-old brother to her "boyfriend" for months 




 Not super exciting, but I was walking with my friend who had bright orange shoelaces, and Charquise stalks up behind us and screams "GIRL DEM SHOELACES ARE CUUUUTE!" and did this snapping thing with her hands and her posse high-fives her 




 It's like "Shar-queece" and she used to put liquid lip gloss on as eye shadow and tried way too hard with everything she did oh my god 




 OH MY GOD THIS IS CHARQUISE I AM CRYING HOW DO YOU KNOW HER. She dated my cousin and was talking about how much she hated white girls right in front of me and was like, "Oh gurl you black in my eyes" I have so many Charquise stories who are you oh my god 




 Agh, I don't think this was it, thank you though! 




 I don't remember what site it was on. I played it maybe 4 or 5 years ago and I still remember it for some reason and would love to play it again. If I remember correctly, you were a guy who was trying to stop these guys from robbing a bank. It was a really silly point and click adventure type game. I don't think the art was very good either, it was a bit ms paint-ish. I remember a gas station and the cashier was a hispanic woman I think. The town was a bit ghetto. I don't remember much about it at all. If anyone has any clue what it is, let me know please. 




 I'm pretty sure this is supposed to be making fun of Ketan Vora 




 Ahah, no he's my friend's younger brother 









 Just out of curiosity, is this guy's name Taylor? He reminds me a LOT of someone I know. 




 I've been listening to this album quite a bit. DAE find it kind of cool how the end of World at Large kind of spills into Float On? 




 There's a hill behind Durant High School in Waterford that's pretty good. I'm sure there are better but I sled there a lot. 
























 I've been trying to, and I think it's actually helping. 




 Wow thank you a+ you win 




 Hello, I need help figuring out how to become more social. I know that lots of people just aren't social and that's okay, but it sucks always feeling left out because I'm too scared to talk to anyone. I'm a 15 year old girl, and even from a young age I've never been able to talk to other kids. I have a few really close friends that I can talk to easily, but with everyone else, it's a lost cause. Sometimes when I really want to say something to someone that I don't know well, I'll count to 10 and say it, but it always comes out in awkward stutters. I think my problem is that people will think I'm weird or they don't like me. Online, I'm able to talk to you guys super easily, but if we were face-to-face it would be all kinds of awkward. I know that everyone thinks I'm really nerdy, because I'm in marching band and get really good grades. Even in marching band though, I can only talk to a select few people. I always feel left out from the group, and it kind of sucks, because everyone else is so close. Do you guys have any tips that could help me with my social awkwardness? Because I can't take it anymore. 




 Woo!

 I know, it just sucks feeling like the weird ugly friend 




 Yes, my best friend in the world is beautiful, lost about 75 pounds, always has guys all over her, has been in a relationship for almost 2 years, and is really good at making friends. I feel so inferior around her. 




 Thank you!

 Awh sure 3 pm me? :) 




 Just a rough break up 




 Jesus Christ  




 We don't really compete, we just do football games and invitationals and festival. We got a 1 at festival though so that's good 




 Euph in concert and marching band, and trombone in jazz  




 I'm Anna, and I need more friends. I like kittens, puppies, music, and sleeping. I play euphonium and trombone in band, and you should pm me c: 




 WOW WHO ARE YOU 




 Sounds fun :3 I'm Anna, I'm 15, from Michigan, a sophomore in high school, had a shitty day, and I enjoy marching band, cats, puppies, and not leaving the house all weekend. 




 You're in marching band so you're automatically perfect tbh 




 I want a watercolor tattoo. I think something abstract would be cool. I'd like it on my wrist, shoulder, or shoulder blade. 




 This made me cringe more than the actual post 




 They do, they're so loyal and I love the energy at the games. 




 Waterford resident  




 So do I. I joke about it too but it gets old when people constantly tell you about how much it sucks where you live when they've never even been there. 




 I messaged you 




 They're gorgeous but they have a lot of problems. The middle clave on mine is really sticky and gets jammed a lot and everyone in my section has at least one major issue with theirs. I'll message you though since I feel like we're spamming this post haha 




 Really? That's funny. How come you're jealous of our euphs? 




 OH MY GOD YOU GUYS ARE GREAT. We were at your invitational last month and you were fantastic and I'm so jealous. What do you play? 




 Yup! Are you in a Michigan band? 




 Band: Waterford Kettering Marching Captains

Instrument: Euphonium

Show Name: Music Royale

Repertoire: Bicycle Race by Queen, Hit the Road Jack by Ray Charles, King Kong by Jimmy Castor, Hall of the Mountain King

Unfortunately, as you can probably tell, we don't compete and we're a show band. We just go to invitationals, festivals, and play at parades and football games. We are a very good band though. Straight 1's at festival for the past three years, we got first place from 150 bands at the Mackinaw City memorial day parade, and we're going to be in the Detroit Thanksgiving Day Parade on national television. Last time we went there we got first. I wish we competed though tbh. 




 Well I don't blame him for getting mad at the professor if he was unprofessional when the question was asked. Of course the slurs weren't necessary but this honestly isn't that cringey 




 My boyfriend has one of these. The damn thing makes me so uncomfortable. 




 There were a bunch of teenage girls doing this exact same thing at the Jason Mraz concert I went to 




 My boyfriend has a body pillow of a female anime character (I have no idea which one) and damn that thing makes me uncomfortable.  




 He said "I'm glad the bitch is dead." 




 Shit like this kind of makes me ashamed to be a feminist 




 What the hell? 




 My best friend's sister is at Grand Valley State and was actually doing this last night... AND took Facebook pictures 




 I don't know why you're getting down voted... 




 Sometimes I hate my state. 




 Yup, that's it! Thank you! 









 Well I don't know what I expected. 




 Air bags are so dangerous. My mom is 4'11 and she would get so injured if the airbag came out. It makes me so worried. 




 Idek I actually really like that family 









 Wow that actually made me really sad. I've had a crush on McCrae since day 1 tbh 




 I honestly would love to see McCrae win veto. He could be such a strong player if it weren't for Amanda. 




 Agreed. 




 Did he really? He blocked me because he threatened suicide for like the 5th time, and I knew he was bluffing, so I messaged his aunt and he hates me now 




 OMG IS THIS ALEX PLEASE TELL ME IT IS I HAVE SO MANY STORIES ABOUT HIM 




 Oh my gosh I'm in Michigan too, and this year at the senior walk out in my school, and there was a group of like 5 kids all walking together in all camo, head to toe, and mumbling in fake southern accents. 




 Nah, just some parts. 




 ^ Same 




 That fact wasn't fun at all! 




 Who said the original quote?  




 I saw a kid do that in elementary school. He just got really bad whiplash. 




 So do I. Flint scares me tbh. 




 Wow that sounds like me in about 8th grade. Really that's creepy as hell, they even got the name, state, and "OMG CATSSS" right. Fuck. 




 Heaven forbid they aren't a Greek god! 




 As a large-ish girl who goes on Tumblr, this is true. Half the girls on there annoy me so much because they are so picky with guys, and when I say that I prefer chubby guys, some of my friends on tumblr act so confused. Because according to them, all kinds of guys are required to like all kinds of girls and have no say in it, but it's okay for them to talk about how gross bigger guys are. Some girls on there are so shallow, it's crazy. 




 Lua - Bright Eyes 




 I will definitely check it out. I know what you mean when you talk about things that speak to you. It sounds great, and like it would help me a lot. Thank you so much for the suggestion. 




 That made me happy to read, you sound wonderful. Of course you can feel free to PM me anytime you want. It would be great to have a friend to relate to in that way, because I don't have any of those. Thank you for reading about me, and feel free to PM me. 




 That's exactly how I've been trying to handle it. I've accepted the fact that I'm not over him, but I don't let my friends say bad things about him anymore. I just try not to think about it. He goes to the other high school in my district, so I only see him occasionally at marching band competitions and invitationals. He told my friend that he wanted to get back together with me, but I realized that he would hurt me like that again, so I just didn't talk to him. But I definitely have been moving on and thinking about other guys, and that has helped me. It was rough, but it is getting a lot better. Thank you. 




 I am a teenage girl who has been dealing with depression and anxiety for about a year and a half. Cutting and suicidal thoughts are things I had issues with for a long time. Before I tell my story, I want to say that finding this, and looking at some of the posts, made me feel less alone. Feeling alone is all too familiar to everyone on this subreddit, and it's amazing that a group of people who are feeling the same things and battling the same things can come together to discuss and guide each other. That's beautiful.

Now for the my story. As a young child, I never fit in. I was always the weird fat girl, and living in a wealthy town full of girls with entitlement issues  didn't help. My mother is very down to Earth, and since it was only her and I living together, we didn't have much money. We were by no means poor, but I didn't live in a fancy house in a nice subdivision, nor did I wear designer brand clothes like all the other kids. My parents divorced when I was two, and my dad was in and out of prison. With all of this being said, I spent most of my time alone and playing by myself when I was little. I had no siblings and no friends to play with. 

Then when I was 10 or 11, about to start middle school, my mother made a spur of the moment decision to move to a town about 10 or 20 miles outside the one we were living in. I was not excited. There were some bad areas of the town, and it intimidated me. My mom tried to assure me that I'd make lots of new friends and that everyone would be nicer. I didn't believe her, because I believed that kids were mean, and that's just how it was. I had no idea that there really were nice kids out there. I started middle school and everything was well, and I was amazed when I wasn't made fun of on the first day. I was very introverted, and didn't have any friends until about halfway through the school year, when I started taking to Jessie, a beautiful trumpet player in my band class who I though was extremely cool. I am still friends with her today, and I met most of my other friends though the people that Jessie knew in elementary school. 6th and 7th grade were good, and while I wasn't popular, and was still "the weird fat girl" in some people's eyes, I had a group of friends that I loved. I was content. 

Then the summer before 8th grade, my father passed away due to a prescription drug overdose. I tried to avoid it, and pretend that it never happened, which only fueled my mourning. My father wasn't perfect, and there were points where I would only see him two or three times a year, but he loved me. He adored me. In the letters he sent to my the rest of my family, he never shut up about me. The thing that hurt me the most is that the last the we talked was on the phone, and I didn't tell him I loved him. As with all deaths, I mourned and then gradually moved on with my life. When 8th grade started, all was well, and I still had the same group of friends.

About halfway through the year, I developed a crush on a close friend, Brandon. He also came from a broken home, with a dead mother, an abusive father, and being in his grandparents' custody with his older brother. I told him, and in early March we started dating. I loved this boy. He was my first boyfriend, first kiss, and first everything. Being the naive young kid I was, we had sex. Because hey, if he's willing to have sex with me, that must mean he really loves me right? Well as you would expect, he broke up with me shortly afterwards, after coming on a vacation with my family and I for my birthday. About a week after my birthday, he randomly became very distant and would only talk to me briefly once every few days, where we used to FaceTime for hours and hours every day. Then one day I sent him a message and asked what was wrong, and after a short argument, he called me on FaceTime. He said he had to break up with me to "protect me" and we were both sobbing. I didn't hear from him for over a year. 

In all honesty, I never really got over him. I still have dreams about him on a nightly basis, and I think he was the thing that really fueled my depression. For once in my life, I felt a mutual love with one of my peers, and then it was gone. I now realize the he used me, and he was very controlling, but I loved him.  I spent weeks and weeks crying over the breakup, but of course, I started getting over it slowly but surely. That was my first experience with cutting. I was sad, and mad at myself, so I grabbed the dull knife from the kitchen and sawed at my arm until there was a swollen cut, with blood oozing out. It felt good. The physical pain distracted me from the mental pain, and for those moments, it relieved my stress. 

Through freshman year, cutting was an issue. I continued to earn good grades and smile, but in marching band, a close-knit group of friends, I felt like an outsider. Jessie made new upperclassmen friends, and I was the awkward weird girl who wouldn't talk to anyone. It got really bad in the winter, and those are when the thoughts got more hostile and I felt more alone. I began more and more to sit in my room alone and listen to music, and avoid everyone around me. It was the same routine at this point: wake up, go to school or pretend I was sick, then lay and bed and sulk. I began becoming anorexic, not eating for a couple days at a time. I have since gotten better with eating, although the thought still rises occasionally. I was put on Zoloft when I was 14 as well as attended therapy, and it helped for a while, but now I am falling back into that pit of loneliness. We quit therapy a few months ago because it became too much money for my mom to handle.

Being a teenager, I like to tell myself this is a phase, or a mere hormone imbalance, but at this point I know it's not. Nothing seems beautiful, and I can find sadness and despondence in most everything. I can't shake the lonely, worthless feeling constantly plaguing me, and I needed to tell my story to people who would understand and point me in the right direction. I really feel less alone now, and I can relate to so many of you. Thank you for reading this, and I look forward to being a supportive part of this subreddit. 




 I bet! John Mayer is great. I saw Jason Mraz last summer, and that was fantastic as well. 




 Nah, he wasn't here that I know of. I'm in Michigan. Did you? 




 Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I was leaning towards getting a ball python. Thanks c: 




 I'll keep that in mind, thanks! 




 I love Harmony Korine so much. Maybe I'm just a pretentious asshole, but I absolutely loved Gummo. It was so unsettling, I loved it.
