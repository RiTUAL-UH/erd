 I am trying to submit Youtube videos of some of my favorite songs that I think others might enjoy. When I click "submit" it throws up an exception in red text  under the that says "that reddit only allows text posts" I don't understand. The sub is filled with Youtube videos, and I thought music videos were the preferred posts there.  


































 She left her ID near the MoneyGram Kiosk, and found it lying there later. As she was leaving she overheard the woman who was standing behind her in line telling the lady at the desk the same reference number and name. She had already received her money, so I don't think this person could have profited from this.

 Ed and Bob had just landed the biggest sale in their firm's history. Ed knew he had to hurry home to his pushy wife Mary, but Bob persuaded him to have a drink or two at a nearby tavern. Being a lightweight, Ed vomited all over his shirt and tie after only a few. 

"Aww man, Mary is going to kill me Bob. You know she doesn't want me drinking or hanging out in bars." 

Bob, feeling overly confident about their recent victory was sure he had the solution. "Don't you worry about her.  Just put this crisp twenty in your shirt pocket. When she sees the vomit tell her that someone else puked on you, and gave you the twenty to pay for the cleaning." They continued to drink until the Tavern closed and each took their own cab home. 

When Ed arrived, Mary was waiting, furious at the hour, and his obvious state of drunkenness. 

"Where have you been!" Ed was already unbuttoning his shirt. "You're drunk... and covered in vomit! What is wrong with you? I should have listened to my mother you worthless sack of... "

"Now hold on one minute, woman!" Ed drunkenly interrupted while Mary tore through and examined his things. "I can explain that vomit! It wasn't me! A guy down at the Tavern threw up all over my shirt. Look in my shirt pocket, there's a  twenty dollar bill. He was honorable enough to pay for the cleaning." He was already crawling into bed, and pulling the covers over himself. "You see, I'm not always the bad guy." 

Mary held up two twenty dollar bills. " Ed, there was $40 in your pocket." 

Ed lifted up from his pillow, squinted one eye, and tried to focus on her. "Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you. He shit my pants too." 


Apologies for submitting from a mobile device. 




 The CS2X caught my attention on eBay. I read some reviews and it sounds like an underrated instrument that can be extremely useful. Anyone play and/or have one? 




 I understand this wasn't a very popular virtual/sampler synthesizer. I can understand some of the gripes I've come across on forums. Support being discontinued being the biggest. But, I am impressed by some of the sounds this thing can produce. I like that it can be programmed and then disconnected from the computer. I was wondering if anyone had any advice with programming the thing. I've spent a few hours with it, and I'm amazed by the number of parameters and controls the thing has. The multi function seems really powerful. Does anyone have any experience with uploading patterns? I've noodled around with many of the presets, but still haven't found a clear path toward making my own patches from scratch. Is that possible? Any other general advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. 




 I would like the sequencer on the Microbrute to sync up with the Venom. I have both MIDI cables amd USB. I would prefer to be able to sync them without using a DAW as I would like to jam free of the computer. I understand how to use MIDI to control one device with another, but I'm not getting anywhere with sending a clock signal between two. Can anyone help me with this? 









 I have a Arturia Laboratory, a Microbrute, and a Boss Dr-550mkII. Two interfaces , Berhinger Q502USB and a an old Tascam US-122L. Tascam has an in/out so I've been playing with it. I have plenty of cables. I am trying to sync these devices without using the USB connection on the Microbrute. If I use more than one USB connection for audio, the noise becomes unbearable. I want to use these devices separately without one ever controlling the other. Just sync. The Laboratory has a Midi in/out. The Microbrute and Boss have an input only. Is there any way that I can make this happen? 




 I am going to keep this as short as possible. Whenever I have my computer plugged into my mixer via USB, I get a loud, high pitched buzz.  It went away the other night, and came back tonight.  I tried isolating every appliance and florescent bulb in the house with no effect. I'm wondering if a failing HDD could cause this? Maybe the power supply fan? I really enjoyed combining my analog gear with my soft synth. Now the frequencies of both are affected. This noise is driving me nuts!

edit: first I tried lifting the ground on the PC, but that only helped when I used my best cable. (I have several music USB cables) I realize that the cables were in the inductive field of my stereo.  Moved the stereo box and everything went away. Sweet silence. I then reapplied the ground to protect my machines and house. Sorry if I wasted anyone's time. I feel like this has been a useful thread. I learned more than a couple of things. Thanks to everyone who commented. Y'all helped me get into critical thinking mode. I don't get enough of it. Thanks again.  
























 Let me first say I'm open to any input as long as it is budget oriented.

I recently acquired an Arturia MicroBrute, and I naturally would like to expand the capabilities of the instrument with some simple effects (and later some complicated stereo effects). I was looking at Zoom effects first because of the value of their entry level line (and the seemingly ancient Reznor endorsement). 

My question mostly involves the frequency processing of bass and guitar effects. I know there is a distinct difference between these instruments. How confined are these pedals to these frequency profiles? I am a bassist by nature (bass guitarist), but I intend on using the full range of the MicroBrute through looping and sampling. I just don't have much money.

I can shoot some sexy pics of the MicroBrute and my Laboratory 49 if necessary. 


































 Today I have seen DHS, FBI, state rides,  and an inordinate amount of local police. I realize it's probably just something local, but it's been all day and night.

 I see plenty of cases where a user has reposted a link in a different subreddit, and gets plenty of upvotes from it. Is that OK? I was chewed out for posting an article when another article has been posted on the **same story** in either the same or a different sub. Is that OK? I've seen some redditors who post their links in several subs at the same time. Is that OK? There is a bot that reposts everything from /r/news, /r/worldnews, /r/politics, into a separate subreddit, /r/POLITIC . That user will get infinite karma from that bot. Is that OK?

 Is it not common knowledge that more than 90% of the veteran's walking around are not active duty or retired and therefore do not currently hold a military ID of any kind? I'm posting this because my university sent out an email inviting everyone to a special football game. The email explained that veteran's and active military get in free with an active ID. Only people who are active, retired, or disabled get an ID. In fact not all disabled have an ID. All of these offers just end up being a slap in the face. Have you ever tried to convince someone at a business or institution that you're really a vet? It's disgraceful!

 Did I say they weren't a threat? No, I didn't.

I was simply pointing out the ridiculousness of your assertion that they "almost won". 

Please tell us more about how they were winning before the allies decimated their entire empire. Tell us about how these competent leaders dragged their country and citizens into an unwinnable unsustainable military campaign that ultimately resulted in the fracturing of their country and the nearly total destruction of its infrastructure. 

Tell us how it was an entirely competent decision to wage an invasion against the Soviets. Explain how in their great wisdom and cunning strategic logic they came to form an alliance with a belligerent and ideologically diseased state like prewar Japan, and how that state waged an antagonistic bombing campaign against the United States effectively bringing them into the war. Tell us about these "great leaders".  




 Yes! Thank you. Allying with Japan was also a huge mistake.  




 It's getting really heated in there. I was just asked if I'm stupid because 

Incompetent leaders wouldn't have almost won against all the superpowers of the world. The Nazis were fucking evil, and I am glad they lost. They were competent as hell though.

That's hilarious. 

 




 Are you stupid? 

Incompetent leaders wouldn't have almost won against all the superpowers of the world. The Nazis were fucking evil, and I am glad they lost. They were competent as hell though.

Bwahaha! 

Edit: Sorry, I just got carried away by the ridiculousness of your comment. Please tell us more about how "They almost won against all of the superpowers of the world". 
 




 The Third Reich manifested during peace time. It's not stupid to look at these things with an* honest and transparent attitude. 

 




 No I'm not. And they're often interrelated.  




 They should change the instructions in the sidebar.  




 You are an apologist if you honestly believe that the Third Reich was comprised of competent leadership. Waging a two front war against all of the world's superpowers? Forming an alliance with belligerent bloodthirsty Japan? The fucking Holocaust? All of the backward hateful rhetoric that was used by the Reich from its inception? There are countless cases of incompetence within the party and throughout the war.  









 I suppose you think that "drug dealers" aren't people and therefore shouldn't have any rights?  




 Many would argue that Germany's actions leading up to and during the war were little more than drunken belligerence. During the final days the Reich and the Wermacht destroyed as much infrastructure as they could in order to prevent the allies from using it. It's disingenuous Nazi apologia to suggest that somehow Germany was less responsible for it's postwar state than Greece is for it's current problems.  




 I disagree. You cited one example of a Jamaican citizen and two other black gentlemen who were commissioned officers (a lieutenant is not a senior officer) but were then dismissed to join the Union Army early in the war. The 1,500 or 2,000 black soldiers and three black officers would have been prohibited from serving in the confederacy in 1862 and your source says that 10% of them went and joined the Union Army. 

You don't have an argument. You either don't understand military rank structure or you're willing to ignore glaring contradictions in your narrative in order to maintain it. Three low ranking officers who served very shortly before being disbanded would not have qualified in any manner as "senior military officers". By the end of the war these men would have been American war heroes, not defeated Confederates. But I encourage you to continue your efforts. Maybe while reading about these men and others like them you'll learn a thing or two about how evil the Confederate leadership really was.  




 Don't you mean that Germany was limping for getting into a drunken brawl that they in fact started? Then, once they realized they were sure to lose they began burning their cloths and effects so that no one else could have access to them?  




 When the Louisiana State Legislature banned people of color from serving in the Confederate Army in February 1862, the regiment was disbanded. Morris and about 10% of the other former 1st Louisiana Native Guard joined the Union Army in September 1862 and were organized into a new unit that was assigned the same name. There Morris became the first black Jewish officer in the Union Army. 

Hmm. Got any other great examples?  




 "nor the greedy". So when will Christians start their campaign to disenfranchise and marginalize the rich?

 Yeah, this is a thing. AA is not a [therapeutic] (http://www.propublica.org/article/how-alcoholics-anonymous-can-be-a-playground-for-violence) environment for alot of people. Beyond being predatory the twelve step system is also not an [effective drug or alcohol treatment program, ] (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-alcoholics-anonymous-work/)  it is a fundamental violation of our first amendment rights as many people are pushed into twelve step whether they're religious or not. Jesus is the most common* topic of discussion for many twelve step groups. This is an everyday violation of our constitutionally protected religious rights, but you don't hear anyone stopping or backing up governmental process over it.

Edit: I'm a huge supporter of gay rights, but I feel that all human rights depend on secularism.  




 I chose* this one because (as you can see) this officer proclaims to be a part of a "we"  that has a contract to "clean up the site". If anyone has anything to say about this select group of users "cleaning up the site" this would be the place and time.  




 Started a new sub. 




 Ideally, this would be a place to discuss the police and the bullshit they spew on pns. I would be open to allowing apologia from other corners of reddit as long as we follow the .np and archive rule. No direct links ever! We can't have a simple conversation with people staring over our shoulders and I won't tolerate them. This is designed to be a circle jerk and that it will be.  









 Like I said. Strict rules. No direct linking, no brigading. If you're interested in moderating, get in touch. Otherwise, have fun. 




 Edit: Thanks for your support. Sub is up and running. If there's a way, could you please give me access to those archives you removed. My sub is only for archives and .Np contributions. I've contacted /u/insaneterrorist. I hope that he digs what I'm trying to get going. Thanks again. 


Please direct those users to contribute to /r/shitpnssays. I'll do my best to keep this conversation alive. 




 It's new. The .np and archive rule is nonnegotiable I will ban you. Otherwise, Come one, come all. If you'd like to moderate please get in touch. /r/shitpnssays 




 I don't disagree with you, but hear me out. /r/shitredditsays is a self-professed, unapologetic circlejerk. They ban anyone who tries to stop the jerk and even those who don't want to jerk. They're protected by the rules of reddit because they ban folks who attack the topic of conversation. They describe their sub as a "turd museum". "Don't touch the turds.". That's  cool that you want to change this sub. I'm still planning on starting my sub. I hope that you'll promote on mine as I'd like to promote on yours.  




 I agree. I don't consider myself an expert in theology, but I'd say that greed has been a tool of the leaders of western Christianity for forty or fifty years at least. When we talk about the US, I'm pretty sure we can walk back all the way to the very beginning and see greed as the singular motivation in most things.  




 I just checked it out. Are you referring to all of the memes? Maybe I'll start a ~~/r/shitprotectandservesays~~ /r/shitpnssays later.  




 Yeah that's him. His videos are very informative.  




 Thank you for being so candid. It's not common for believers to speak honestly about these offenses which may not affect literally every church but are extremely common.  




 Is he the body guard guy who always has his lawyer waiting by the phone? His videos are awesome. He really knows what he's doing and doesn't fuck around. Those are how first amendment audits ought* to be conducted.  




 Shouldn't you have included some text or even a source?  




 Yeah I would be more supportive of banning brigadiers and removing the downvote button than censoring content to protect the feelings of a few butthurt piggy-wiggies.  




 What about conversations where officers are flippant about the law, joke about harming people, or blatantly ignore or ridicule constitutional rights?  




 Apparently she's been very clear that has every intention of keeping the position.  




 I guess "cleaning up the site" means* cops brigading any comment that isn't explicitly procop or any they disagree with.  




 Yes it does.  




 She did actually. She did an interview with the New York Times.  




 You're mistaken if you took anything I've said as a defense of American law enforcement.  




 I don't think it's ever going to go away.  




 Kickbacks for RXs is illegal. 

Yet it happens all of the time. Go [here] (https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/) and look up your doctor or some local doctors. My previous psychiatrist who works in a state funded mental health clinic has personally received around $25,000 from pharmaceutical companies. 

You can hurl whatever personal insults at me that you like. I was simply pointing out this very cosy relationship between pharmaceutical companies and physicians. That's fine if you disagree. But don't suggest that I'm crazy or that this issue isn't worth talking about.  




 I wasn't agreeing with all of the statement, but I think people saw that I was agreeing that these men in the picture were fighting for their country, and I pointed out that not all German soldiers were Nazis, can you not see the difference in the two comments?

But yes, you just can't predict reddit logic sometimes!

 









 Thanks for the link. Lots of useful stuff.  




 They are most commonly prescribed to people with mild to moderate depression. SSRIs are not effective for mild to moderate depression. What is so complicated about this?  




 Racial profiling isn't unique to American police.  




 The magnitude of benefit of antidepressant medication compared with placebo increases with severity of depression symptoms and may be minimal or nonexistent, on average, in patients with mild or moderate symptoms. 

For the vast majority of patients ssris produce the same effect as a placebo.  




 Considering that they're most commonly prescribed for cases of mild/moderate depression, I would argue that it does.  




 Where the hell does it say that this sub is only for the misconduct of American police?  




 Does the [JAMA count?] (http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=185157)  




 Yes they actually can. They can receive all kinds of kickbacks and favors from drug companies and simply prescribing medications to all of their patients streamlines and maximizes the profitability their practices. A medicated patient is placated and must return to the office periodically to renew their prescriptions. A renewal is a fast and easy billable visit. 

Edit: forgot two words.  




 Does that really matter though?  




 I didn't say that people didn't matter. I'm just saying that a business closing is nothing like a person dying. It's not even close. If the business closes the people who worked there are free to find employment elsewhere. A dead person cannot. 

Businesses close all of the time. Most close because of causes that are completely out of the control of the organization's leaders. If a bakery refused to follow sanitation codes the health department would shut them down and it would be their fault. It wouldn't matter if they had a religious belief that washing their hands is wrong. If a business is operating on such unsustainable policies as refusing to provide the products and services that they deal in, why should it be a surprise when they have to shut their doors?  




 A business closing down is hardly the same as a person dying. Businesses close and are restructured all of the time. Most don't close as a result of a policy so stupid as refusing to provide the good or service they deal in. The individual(s)  with the* capital can choose to take* their money and knowledge and engage in other business efforts. A dead person can do none of* these things. The argument that businesses are people is as ridiculous as one can be. Businesses are comprised of people and those individuals already have the protections and rights of a human being. Businesses don't warrant some special status as human beings. 

The cake situation, as ridiculous as it might be, is exactly what we're talking about here. That's the real world example.  




 How is that even close to comparable? It's not like it's an atrocity that a baker should have to bake a cake.  
















































































































































 A lot of people (myself included) are fed up with the way that sub is moderated. I'm looking for alternatives that don't arbitrarily prohibit subject material like police brutality/harassment. Thanks in advance for any input.

Edit: I should clarify that I'm looking for subreddits.  







































































































































































































 Two New Yorkers are driving across the country. When they cross the Texas border the passenger looks at the driver and explains "Texas cops are supposed to be the worst and they really don't like New Yorkers. Let's try to obey all of the traffic laws so we can get through this state without any problems."

They hadn't made it very far when the driver notices a state trooper's cruiser appear behind them with lights ablazed. He quickly puts on his signal and pulls over. The trooper approaches the driver side window and the driver quickly lowers his window, only to find the officers baton smashing into his face. 

"What the fuck was that for!?" the driver exclaims. 

"I don't know how you city slickers do things in New York, but in my state you'll have your license and registration waiting for me when I approach your vehicle." the trooper barks at the driver. Frantically the driver retrieves the paperwork and hands it to the cop, who proceeds to write him a ticket. "Wait right there. " he spits while handing the ticket over to the driver.  He walks around the car and taps on the passenger side window with his baton. Nervously the man lowers his window. The officer quickly strikes him in the face.


"What the hell did I do!? He shouts as blood runs down his chin.

 Reserve deputy Rick Walter was catching up on paperwork one night in the fall of 1992 when he was told to check out an abandoned car near Interstate 55.

He found a 1986 Buick Somerset at the top of an exit ramp about 1:30 a.m., just outside of this southeastern Missouri town that rises above the Mississippi River floodplain. Inside was the body of Angela Mischelle Lawless, a 19-year-old nursing student.

Lawless had been shot three times, once in the back of the head. But when Walter looked inside the car, he couldn't determine exactly how she had died.

"It was dark, and I didn't know if it was somebody just passed out," Walter said. "We opened the door and saw all the blood."

Fifteen years later, Walter, now the Scott County sheriff, sits in his windowless office and lets the Lawless case play out in his mind. There should be little reason to think about it now. Joshua Charles Kezer was convicted for the killing and sentenced to 60 years in prison. The case is closed.

But things just don't add up, Walter said.

Lawless clearly fought for her life against at least two attackers, Walter said, and yet, investigators identified and pursued only one suspect.

There were no witnesses to the killing. No physical evidence - DNA, fingerprints or murder weapon - linked Kezer to the scene. In fact, Kezer's friends and family say he wasn't even in the state the night Lawless was killed.

"People in the law enforcement community and regular people here have told me that they got the wrong guy in jail," Walter said.

So in early 2006, Walter did something almost unheard of in law enforcement: He reopened a murder case that was not only closed, but had already produced a conviction.

The sheriff and one of his detectives began reviewing hundreds of pages of investigative reports and witness statements. It would be a daunting task.

Witnesses were scattered. Fingerprints and blood can be reviewed and retested, but it was unclear what could be gleaned more than a decade later.

None of that mattered to the sheriff, a former construction worker who regularly wears a quarter-size pin that reads "My Son is a Marine." He already knew that if he ever got the chance, he would reopen the case.

"I wake up most mornings and wonder, 'Why am I sheriff?'" said Walter, who was elected in 2004. "I think this is why - to find the truth on this case."

FIRST TO THE SCENE

Everyone called her Mischelle. She was a cheerleader for the Kelly High School Hawks basketball team in Benton, and a farm girl at heart, having been active in the local FFA Organization.

In her younger years, she was a Girl Scout who volunteered as a candy-striper at area hospitals, so it was only natural that Lawless would pursue a nursing degree at Southeast Missouri State University.

"That's what she always wanted to do," her brother Jason said.

In many ways, Lawless was a bundle of contradictions. By her sophomore year in college, she was juggling boyfriends and partying a lot, friends said, yet she remained a regular at the Baptist Student Union.

Though she weighed just 95 pounds, Lawless wasn't afraid to stand up for herself. 



I know this may be pretty well known, but it happened very nearby and has been complicated and painful for this area.
