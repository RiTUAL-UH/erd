 Funny ~~re~~post bro 




 Sad to see the comments section has devolved into a java rocks vs java sucks war. As an intermediate level programmer using Android, I got something out of it. He makes some valid points regarding for each loops which require the use of iterator() and Iterators, which can necessitate more GC when used for long lists. The use of static methods also helps when you don't need to access any instance variables. Google's Developer section also points these things out and more in their documentation article about increasing performance: [Link](http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/performance.html) 









 the build up was what made it so good too haha. 




 sick flow and very lyrical for his age. the thing is he has room for improvement too

a newer track from OF with him in it (his verse starts at 7:05): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzi24Nssiow 




 Are you referring to Android's "Dalvik" JVM? 




 ah yes. Handles! 




 freakin upvote people! 




 Extreme chunk error is extreme... am I wrong or can people reproduce this with the same seed? Just curious. 




 You can't help but facepalm.jpg 




 Is this a Nas instrumental? (hope I'm not embarrassing myself lol) 




 great mix man make #3 i will listen! 




 Here's the release schedule for those who don't feel like searching:

M7  Friday, May 11
RC1 Friday, May 25
RC2 Friday, June 01
RC3 Friday, June 08
RC4 Friday, June 15
Quiet time, June 16 to June 27
 (no builds during "quiet time", assumed all code is done by end of RC4)
Release Wednesday, June 27, 2012 




 All pretty valid points, thanks for clearing that up. 




 I'm a fan of Hopsin. I think he's pretty lyrical. However, the verse about Obama on Nocturnal Rainbows is extremely ignorant if that's what he actually believes. He mentions the Illuminati as if they actually exist...

 lol boke 




 at a [0] in psych lecture 




 I know that feel bro, uptoked all the way :) 




 Use a different operating system... 




 obviously... 









 I wish more people like you were more involved in bug reports for all kinds of software. 




 ...Sarcasm? 




 I am very experienced with Java, and willing to help! Is there a public repository that I can pull from or does one need to be granted push/pull permissions?

edit: Never mind, I found the GitHub repo and downloaded the source code. Still looking for the bug list.  
edit 2: Found the bug list. Currently familiarizing myself with the codebase. My username on GitHub is test_subject2673.  
edit 3: Working on [#BUKKIT-2181](https://bukkit.atlassian.net/browse/BUKKIT-2181) found the problem in code, will try to fix tomorrow.  
edit 4: Working with undocumented code takes a lot longer, there are hundreds of undocumented functions named a() or b(). Doing the best I can though.  
edit 5: BUKKIT-2181 seems to be a server-side issue that can only be fixed with a client side mod  
edit 6: Commented on [BUKKIT-2193](https://bukkit.atlassian.net/browse/BUKKIT-2193) with a possible fix.  
edit 7: after reading through some of the emails I got after signing up for the github notifications, the sheer amount of complaining is staggering 




 Also if anyone plans on responding, I would appreciate a technical explanation, not a scrub explanation. 




 Back it up and keep it down until a fix is found... Is there any way of detecting client side mods? How do the nocheat and nocheat+ multiplayer server options work? 




 This just happened to me 5 minutes ago... I feel like a complete idiot. Same guy too! 




 I don't have the pair of menus like that on my LXpanel, so I guess the changes won't be affecting me. Thanks for the great explanation :) 




 Sorry if this is a nooby question, but I run Lubuntu 12.04 (basically ubuntu with LXDE instead of GNOME) and I was wondering if this change would affect Lubuntu 12.10 as well. 




 Ahh didn't notice the interface part. Thanks for pointing that out. 




 the palmer squares need to go on tour 




 Just checked the Java 7 docs as well, was disappointed to see it still there. 




 there is (sort of): /r/badcode 




 You're absolutely right about the attitude part. However, the user shouldn't have to choose between familiar/functional interfaces and security (not sure why you called it abstract, do you mean that users aren't aware of how vulnerabilities work?). I use Nightly Linux x86 and first thing I do in the morning is update it, then get on with browsing. If there are multiple updates in one day and it pops up to notify me, I simply press restart to update, wait a WHOLE 5 SECONDS and carry on with my business. Firefox even saves all your tabs for you while you update, so I suppose the point I'm trying to make is why are people so angry about quick updates? My best guess is that the vast majority of users have no idea about major exploits and the consequences of running unpatched software. Feel free to let me know if I'm going in the wrong direction with this though, because what I feel it really boils down to is patience. 




 "But I WANT zero-day exploits in my browser! WAAAHHHH WE NEED MORE UNPATCHED REMOTE CODE EXECUTION EXPLOITS!" That's all I hear when people complain to me about browser updates. 




 Came into this topic expecting propositions of new logos and being able to feast my eyes upon new potential candidates... 




 Platform fragmentation makes it hard to support a large range of devices when developing apps. As an Android app developer, I understand the struggle of maintaining compatibility with older platforms when newer versions of an app can have API-specific dependencies, and therefore hold nothing against Google in the way they've made Chrome available on Android.
EDIT: I'm a Firefox user though. Where is my file menu Chrome? I'm still waiting for that option. 




 AMD procs implement the x86 instruction set in a different way as well, not sure if that makes a difference though. 




 Great read. I was surprised most by the 1 in 190 initial failure rate of CPUs being higher than the 1 in 270 initial failure rate of hard drives. Did anyone else find that odd? 




 Serious question: What kind of companies rent that much compute power for 87k an hour (if i read the post correctly)? 




 Very informative! Malware authors sure are a peculiar bunch... 




 I love the way you shifted it to minor instead of major (that Rocket Man is in). Great song! 




 You're right, it was a pretty bad generalization. 
























 Thank you! Dear god yes 




 That nug looks like a sinusoidal wave. Anyone? 




 I have not tried this, nor do i have any experience with edibles, but I came up with this idea while I was really high. So what you would do is bake chocolate sauce with a bunch of kief and dip strawberries and bananas in the resulting sauce. Don't know if this would work... 




 Kudos to you, I'm way too stressed out during the week to want to do anything other than chill on a Friday. 




 Tax season keeps the o's rolling in 




 Sorry that had to happen to you friend. Some people just don't understand. 




 I don't vape because a vape is 170$+. Also bongs get you way higher than vapes. They are both different highs though. 




 Do you have any other reason for supporting this initiative other than "I don't like cigarette smoke, therefore nobody should be able to smoke anywhere on campus, because I live on campus"? Your opinion comes across as closed-minded and self-centered. 




 Just hold your breath. I don't smoke, but I still respect smokers' desire to be able to smoke outside. It's really not a big deal at all. Don't let it rustle your jimmies. 




 Toking up for you tonight. Good luck with life friend 




 Good stuff man i would attend 




 Being high opens your mind to new possibilities and helps you realize that everyone is just like you and that we should all respect one another. I speak from experience when i say that I am more mature and my mind is more open after i started smoking on occasion. You will also feel very happy and appreciate everything around you, like nature, much more as you realize life is the result of a complex set of interacting systems. Toke on, friend. 




 Honestly I never post, but I felt morally obligated to offer my condolences to any parties involved. :( 




 Just dropping in to say congrats, that was smooth as silk 




 I won't lie - the title almost made me downvote the content immediately. Then I noticed it wasn't a self-post. Then I read the attached article. Very well said. I need to work on how quickly I judge posts made on reddit... 




 College student, RA is never around, never make noise 




 It looks more like a joint to me. Needs moar weed. Good roll though 




 I'm not sure I fully understand. Can't you just declare the method as final in Java to prevent subclasses from overriding it? Or is the OOP concept of overriding itself at fault here? 




 301 reporting :) 




 i see it. uptoke to bad movies haha 




 So last night I smoked and then went to eat at a cafeteria. I had grabbed some delicious brownies and was walking back to the table my friend was at who was at a [6] but he handles his shit like a fucking boss. Looked down on the ground and I found what I thought to be 40 bucks. I rush over and pick it up, suddenly aware people probably think I'm baked as fuck.  
Anyway when I get back to my table and show my friend I take it out of my pocket and it was actually 60 bucks! At this point I could not handle my shit at all; I had just found the largest amount of cash ever in my life on the ground. I was leaning forward on the table giggling uncontrollably, getting paranoid that someone might have seen me pick it up. But no one did, and me and my buddy left the cafeteria 60 bucks richer. I plan on using it to buy an eighth. Good times.  
TL;DR found 60 bucks on the ground, using it to buy an eighth :D  
edit: also I really enjoyed the brownie. 




 I definitely second CLRS, the sections on Red-Black trees and hashing are great. The book even denotes parts that are intended mostly for grad students so if it doesn't make sense then you don't have to panic :) 




 very good story, read the whole thing. i think you acted very maturely dude, I would have lost my shit if the police put me in cuffs... Congrats everything was cool at the end too. uptoke for chill police and even chiller people 




 *sits and waits patiently* 




 Some implementations are a bit messy.  A bit.  Messy. 




 If you can get your hands on it, try medical or blue dream. Those two get rid of my back pain very effectively. 




 This. I really enjoy smoking with friends as a social experience because it enhances it. Even if i gotta smoke people up most of the time :) 




 That was fucking beautiful ;_; Uptoke for great justice
