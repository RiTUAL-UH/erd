 Nothing will keep multipools from mining profitable coins 




 Yup that's a thing 




 They already did at the 1.6 fork/update. It's called digishield and the digibyte guys helped with it. 

The reason multipools are still mining doge is because of the profitability.  




 Sounds like a plan 




 Um hmm 




 I'm a little disappointed. I asked another shibe to post him on his 'roo and he didn't. Now you post without your 'roo. I'm starting to think all my geometry classes and books were wrong about the land down Under 




 Oh snap tarp is a Muse!  




 Hehehe :) 




 Aww sucks now I'm blushing. But seriously I'm worth like 10 head of cattle so I hope you can pay up

 You'll be a cactus if you create that name. Facts are false, Tuesdays rule

 Lol I'm getting ripped now 




 Wut is dat 




 What's his reddit name?  




 You need encouragement? Did you put a little too much money into dogecoin than you could afford? 

Dogecoin has been around since December (as have I) and so much has been accomplished! The water wells, Jamaican bobsled team, save them hood, Nascar. The community is always positive and has grown to almost the size of btc. For dogecoin to go away it would mean that no one mines anymore and there are no more merchants to accept it and no longer has volume on exchanges. I don't see that happening anytime 




 That logo was created by /u/theprophet84 about a month ago. looks like he hasn't been online in 3 weeks 




 Omg you're gonna turn her into a Shiba inu? You monster 




 are you alright? your face looks a bit cartoony 




 Nice ribeye medium. Peppercorn Cream sauce. Ceasar salad. Red kool-aid 




 Dude you're so in with those. What do you need me for?  




 Me neither 




 No stores but I can serve you guys a nice romantic candle lit dinner of honey nut cheerios 




 Dallas/ft worth 




 Is this a mugshot? 




 Im thinking 3 wallets. Mobile, pc, and my pc. Just to be safe 




 Stop using the drive if possible. Load it into another pc and run recovery software like "Recuva" looking for any *.key files (I believe that's the wallet from multidoge)
