 I'm the same. Mainly, though, for me, it's that both hands look pretty bad because I'm a n00b to this stuff.

My suggestion is to stabilize your non-dominant hand with your dominant one. Put your dominant pinkie on your non-dominant palm for painting the thumb, then do the same with your thumb for the others. Works for me on both sides, since I have really shaky hands. 




 What is that glitter? I love it! 




 So Long, Astoria. 




  Franais! and Chers amis, bouvons! with friend who speak French.

 Upvote to OP for being a (rare as fuck) female on reddit. 




 As a poor college kid who can barely afford Kamchatka, yours is high-quality. 




 There is a method to the madness. I'm planning on putting candles in all these and strewing them about the house I live in next year. 









 Liquor before wine, gonna be fine. Wine before liquor, never been sicker. 




 I'd heard how good that was. Only reason we did this instead is because I had a really bad time involving schnapps, and I can't stand the stuff anymore. 




 I actually tried to minimize the tits in that photo. Didn't want to seem like a karma whore. 




 We shook it ever once in a while and let it sit for about 45 minutes, or until the candy canes dissolved. 




 If you want to take shots of it, use better quality vodka than we could afford. It may taste a bit like mouthwash, but spending a little more might minimize that. 




 We're poor college students, ok! I know it's retched. It was solely for mixing. 









 I saved this to print out and put next to my liquor cabinet. Thank you.
Edit: double post is doubled. Fuck my phone. 




 I saved this to print out and put next to my liquor cabinet. Thank you. 




 Be careful. Depending on how drunk they were,  they may very well have given you the wrong number. Or,  I suppose,  depending on how attractive you are. But I'll give you the benefit of the doubt  




 As a hot young lady who has recently been played like a card by a hot young man, I can understand.

Fuck boys, then only men I need in my life are Jack, Johnnie, and Jerry. 




 I've been frequenting this subreddit, jealous of all of you in your ability to still get drunk. Next year, I shall be able to go to the liquor store and will be doing so for the family (I'm the one who always gets the stuff for food anyway, they told me they can't wait till I can buy the booze, too). Scotch and ginger ale. Seems bad, considering teh cost of the Scotch, but fuck it, I gotta pilfer anyways. 




 If you're like me, you'll be wasting a lot of green if you try to hand roll. My fingers are just not nimble enough for it, and since I mainly smoke rolled things, using a roller is ideal, for time's sake. 




 I'm an American, and my best friend and I are the only people I know who smoke spliffs often. It might have something to do with our pack-a-day habits, but we love our spliffs. 




 I usually don't upvote manis with crazy stuff glued everywhere (personal preference, do whatever makes you happy), but the Trekkie in me demanded it. 




 Why would it even matter if it was from a her or not? Unless you're guessing Craigslist for meeting another person (sketchy as hell), you can just have it mailed to you. If you're that nervous that a creeper will come, set up a P.O. box. 




 My ex boyfriend's sister was autistic, and I've never seen more beautiful art outside a museum, and even some of that was worse. I'm "gifted" (politically correct for smarter than most) and I can't draw a straight line with a ruler. I have another autistic friend who is on par with me, sort wise. It all depends. 




 Canadian Mist and Canada Dry. I call it extra Canadian drink, eh. 




 Thank you so much for the CoverGirl suggestion! I'd love to be able to spend $24 on one product, but I'm a poor college students, and clearly smokes are slightly more important to me  




 Thanks! I'll look into a lip primer while I'm searching for Christmas presents. 




 Might sound silly, but I'm guessing the blush should match the lipstick? Which means, for pale me, that wouldn't work for red lips. Also, I just use a light powder foundation on my face, so I don't really have a need to get translucent powder just for this.... 




 This is true, but it's becoming a bit of a pain, what with the fact that I have to touch up upwards of ten times a day, for cigarettes alone. I usually give up and wipe it all off before my first class of the day  




 As a smoker, I always have trouble keeping my lipstick from rubbing off in the center of my lips. Is there anything I can do to help this? I really want to wear lipstick more often, but I usually have to go to stain, which dries my lips out, or just balm.

Please, no responses about how bad smoking is for you, trust me, I know.

EDIT: I am a poor college student, so, while I'm sure things that are $24 per are great, they aren't really an option for me. 




 I was afraid I'd recognize it from the pictures. Thankfully, I didn't  




 That is much better than what the poor college kid must resort to. 

In case you were wondering, Extra Canadian Drink is a staple for me. Canadian Mist+Canada Dry. 




 Also if you aren't in one of the ten states with no exceptions. Because fuck Indiana. 




 Yes, she is. And condone is a great word. 




 Good, since I crossed it out for a reason. 




 Bah, I don't know how to delete my double post on mobile! 




 I'll give you a hint: I break rule 37; there are, in fact, girls on the internet. 




 They call me Jay/Cory/Gary, that's not my name! 




 Only do this if your roomie is cool. I don't condone starting roomie wars  




 Not midget. Midge. Like short for Margaret. Don't ask me why. 









 In the post regarding cold weather wear (not sure how to link on mobile), there seems to be indecision about how fashionable the tights, knee high socks, and skirt combination is. Personally, I think it's absolutely adorable. I do it often, with all different types of skirts. This http://www.imgur.com/AYb3O.jpeg is one example. Here http://www.imgur.com/w6VVy.jpeg is another. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think both work.

Thoughts? 




 There are herbal, legal, nicotine free smokes. The brand Extacy is coming to mind. These are usually damiana based, which is the herb on which most synthetic legal high chemicals are sprayed. Extra bonus: damiana tends to make you horny. 




 I live in Bumfuck, Indiana, and I have only not received texts if the other person didn't have my number right.

Edit: I a word. 




 Oh my goodness, yes. This one guy, I still talk to him a lot, but can't really have sex with him anymore (he's got herpes, I don't and want to keep it that way). I've had to step back multiple times because I started to want more than he did and I didn't want to torture myself.... yet I still would go to his bed almost at the drop of a hat. 




 Greater safety, yes. For a lot of women, however, spermicide causes pain, itching, and dryness. Allergies are also not uncommon (I've got one). 

For serious safety, wear a condom, but still dint finish inside her. I had a really paranoid ex who always did this. 




 Personally, even if the person is good at it, I hate having a tongue in my mouth that isn't my own. My ex was the first person to always do this, and I never knew what to do in return. 

I guess, try things like what she did to you. Take it slow, gauge her response. Don't just start by sticking your tongue down her throat. 




 Hmm, I always heard that as "shes ugly everywhere but her (butter) face." I like yours, too. 




 House music competition. Do you mean a music competition in-house, or a competition of different house music artists? 




 I used to not like them because I was bad at them and they seemed tedious. I got better with practice, because I wanted to please my partner. I had an ex to whom I gave at least one blowjob a day for six months. I got pretty damn good at it from that, if I may be so immodest. Now I just love knowing that those sounds and faces he's making are directly caused by me. It's a great feeling. 




 I think we may have the same ex, haha. I always had to start and end every session with head, and hardly ever was it reciprocated. At least I got better at it. 




 Valentine's Day babies, represent! 




 This particular guy would have been bad either way, he was a chauvinist. But yes, he got way too attached and I had to deal with him for a good while after it happened and I said I didn't want more.

I'm sure not all virgins would be like that, but I know I was and this guy was, so I just don't want to deal with it. Besides, it is a decent amount of responsibility, being someone's deflowerer. 




 Because of shitty legal reasons not related to alcohol, I have to go to AA meetings (ok, I could go to NA meetings, but a pothead fits better with alcoholics than meth heads) and I agree that it isn't a joke. A lot of people have to go for legal reasons, some people would get their children taken away if they didn't go, etc.

I understand the joke, and yeah, it's pretty funny. But actual AA meetings are some of the most depressing places ever. Not butthurt, just sayin. 




 As a female who has been called attractive who chugs her fair share of beers, I hope this is at least decently common. 




 From experience, I can only think of two: I don't sleep with virgins or Nazis.
I've deflowered a guy and it was very unpleasant for a while afterwards.
The other? I was in this guy's bed, we were making out and his shirt came off. I saw a giant swastika tattoo. I pushed him away, asked if he was a Nazi. "Does it make it better that it was a prison thing?" That was the day I learned that Nazis turn me off.  




 I personally can't tell a difference between any type of condom, or between sex with a condom and bareback.

The one thing I *can* tell, is the difference between a condom with spermicide and any other type of sex. I know it's probably just me, because I am violently allergic to the stuff (like, lips swell shut and out, sitting down is really painful for a few days), but I've heard from other non-allergic people that it is drying and irritating. 

I'd say go for normal lubrication on your rubbers, in case she is allergic. Because if allergic reactions in your nose or eyes are bad, allergic reactions on your ladybits are awful. 




 Partially because my GP is an ass, partly because I'm in college, but I just never bothered to renew my script after it ran out last September. I hadn't even thought of the waiting list. 




 20-year-old female. Lost my virginity about 18 months ago. 

Have had  piv sex with 15 people, only oral with 2. 

One six-month relationship, four month-or-two-long flings, five less-than-one-month flings, seven one-night-stands. 




 What is the context of this house party? Is it a small group of friends hanging out? Or is it a large group of people getting drunk and grinding all up on each other?

While assuming anything is bad always, getting it in at the end of the night would be more likely at the latter type of party. Just don't be that guy who invites her, goes separately, and tries to dance with her after she's seen you make out with four other girls (that didn't happen to me this weekend or anything). 




 Dodgeball: an excuse for good athletic children to beat the living shit out of the weaker ones in the name of "fun." 




 Pourquoi pas 'moi, en cuisinant du lait?' Trop difficile?

(Also, don't quote me on that verb tense, I've always been bad at present perfect)
Edit: grammar 




 I already had these views on love. We've got multiple soul mates, and yeah, attraction at first sight is a thing, but love is a completely different matter. Love involves personalities that work together, matching sex drives, equal levels of emotional attachment, and all sorts of other things. 




 I have to move out Friday. It'll be clean then. 




 The mobile phone is a beautiful thing. Auto correct is the best. 




 You gotta learn how to pour that shit, man. You gotta tilt both the glass and the bottle/can.

 WOOOOOO, KAWLWGE! 




 Is a beer ok? I don't have any liquor for shots. 




 See, this particular paper is just a long rant in French about how "one true love" and "love at first sight" is a load of bullshit. I have to reference a couple works of 19th century French literature (can you tell yet that I'm a French major?) which, from my knowledge of the texts, all have to do with either "love makes life miserable" or "everything in my life sucks and I hate it all." I get to write two short papers for the class, so one is dealing with love, the other will be dealing with how literature from before modern psychology effected the idea that mental health is something that one should be at least reasonably knowledgeable about.

I'm not in serious paper writing mode or anything.
 




 Yes. Yes it is. And my roommate and I both have fridges. Not bragging or anything.

Also, auto correct makes me happy

 Hello trees. I recently got arrested and had to give up the herb for a few months. I want to tell you all the story of how I learned that this plant is the best medication I could every ask for.

I'm a young female ent. I'm in college. I have a family history of depression, anxiety, OCD, and alcoholism. The first three have plagued me my whole life.

I did ballet for nine years growing up, which is not a healthy environment for a kid. It forces you, from a very young age, to try for perfection in every aspect of your life, which is simply unattainable and unhealthy. At age 12 I started cutting myself to cope with the feelings of inadequacy. By age 15 I was doing it every day. At 16 I was put on anti-anxiety medication by a doctor, which made me feel like an empty shell of a person. Instead of anxious and all the other emotions, I just felt no emotions. I was a bitch, and more people than I can count called me crazy on a daily basis. I didn't have any real friends, I never saw anyone outside of school.

Right before I graduated high school, I found an old childhood friend on Facebook. The same day he added me, he messaged me telling me we should hang out. Two hours later, I was in his car with some of his friends on the way to a beautiful lake in the country. We swim for a while, then get back up on the dock. He whips out a joint and lights it up. When he passed it to me, I said I had never smoked before, and his face instantly lit up. "Try it," he said, "you'll like it."

I had never felt so uplifted and happy in my life. It was like all the unnecessary, stupid worries that had always plagued me were dissolved from my brain. I just started laughing uncontrollably, almost crying because I had never been as relaxed as I was then.

I smoked every day for a year and a half. I got arrested, and as part of the treatment program the man put me in, I have to pass two piss tests. It has been two weeks today. I feel like I did for the six years leading up to that day. I have either gotten drunk or cut myself every day. I hate it. It is unhealthy, makes me feel like shit the next day, and isn't a good thing, considering the strong history of alcoholism in my family.

I am not applying to any graduate schools in states that don't allow medical marijuana. And I hope, if any of you other ents get to feeling low, anxious, and miserable like I've been and will be for the next few months, you will read this and remember: trees can help. I'm sure, for some of you, it won't, but for me, it is the best thing out there.

Toke one up for those who haven't yet discovered this magical plant. Not even for me, for that would be selfish. I hope that, one day, no one will have to cover up their bodies to hide from the embarrassment of self-inflicted injuries. No one will turn to the blade because they will have the herb instead.  




 Truth.... Still not something you want to put on Facebook. 




 A visible bulge is nothing compared to what (it seems like) lazy college students wear. I know precisely the shape of most of my male friends' penises, because they really enjoy the basketball-shorts-with-no-underwear look. If you can't see the shape of the head of your member, it's fine with me. 




 I was about to ask the same thing. Might have something to do with the fact that it's all I got in my last relationship, so I had to figure out what worked. Only time I've ever orgasmed from just PIV sex was in Cowgirl. 




 4/20 always lands in the middle of Little 500 weekend (bike race/best party weekend in the country). Which means my humble abode welcomes police from five neighboring counties, as well as some out of state ones. This year it's on the day of the men's race, also known as the day with the most arrests in the state, if I'm not wrong.

IU ent problems. 




 Being 14 is not an excuse for not understanding this. This is taught in basic health class from when you were young

Unless you went to a school with abstinence only sex education or (like me) none at all. Enough girls in my high school got pregnant that you'd think they'd put two and two together.
 









 Me too, although I've also heard those called pops or poppers. 




 The Blue Moon pumpkin ale is one of my new favorite things. 




 Uptoke for cowboy killers (my cigarette of choice). 




 I also see it as "wow, you're cool. No one can connect your face with all that illegal substance. And no one who doesn't approve can see." Be responsible with your trees, kids. Getting arrested really sucks. 




 I used to be like that. I hated being on top because I didn't know what I was doing. I either sat on the guy's dick or was folded over on top of him; either way, he was still doing most of the work.

Now being on top is second only to doggy. I do a lot of moving my hips by moving my body (former swimmer, it's a lot like the dolphin kick without the legs) and what are actually very similar to a man's thrusts, but with more emphasis on the back swing (if we're facing each other). I recently had some amazing sex on top doing this, I was able to be fucked as hard as I wanted without having to ask him to go harder.

As mentioned before, though, you are still a good lay if you keep doing what you're doing. If you want to do more, try adjusting the angle of your hips in missionary. To build up strength, try dancing around when you're alone. Focus on moving your hips in a circle while keeping your top half relatively still. It's a good ab workout, which never hurts anyway. 




 I've shaved every day for three years. Sometimes I get little bumps and it can get a little itchy at the end of the day, but I usually don't have any problems. 




 Because what else are those sad excuses for novels good for? 




 I do believe you go to the same school as me. Or I'm just high. Hoosier? 




 So, I've been seeing this guy for a couple weeks now, but we haven't gone on any real dates. We met and hit it off really well, but didn't really hang out. Then, three Fridays ago, he happens to be part of the crew I'm leading to a party (we're in college in my hometown, so everyone relies on me to know where places are) and I just sort of decide to make moves on him. We leave the party to get smokes and he decides to bum to me for the night. We leave with his roommate to go to another party, then we end up very drunkenly wandering around campus. I end up going back to his dorm and we have sex. Next day he comes over to my dorm, we cuddle under a blanket for hours and then he spends the night. We hung out nearly every day, sometimes spending the night. A week after that first night, he invites me over to his friend from home's house and he has his arm around me for most of the night as a lot of other people from his hometown come over. I went over there again last night with his roommate and got way too drunk and the guy ended up having to take care of me, which I hate. I apologize and he says it isn't a big deal and happens to everyone.

What's bothering me is that we haven't had the 'are we dating' conversation because I don't want to rush it, nor do I really even know what I want. However, multiple people have either asked me if we're dating, or congratulated me on my new 'relationship.' I'm very confused, because I don't think what we've been doing is dating, but other people seem to think so. Are we dating? We haven't gone out anywhere together, there's just an obvious mutual interest.

Tl; dr, I've been hanging out and having sex with this guy I'm into, but I don't think we're dating, despite what other people say. Are we? 




 It may not be great. It may hurt a bit. My first time was great, didn't hurt at all, and generally awesome, but that seems to be unusual. I fell into the 'we had sex, now I'm in love with you' trap, although that may be because I had known the guy since childhood. 

As for getting handsy, follow his lead. Start off with a hand in his hair and one on his neck. Slide one down his chest or his back. I like to lightly massage his shoulders. Then grab his hips, pull him in closer. If he touches any part of you, it's fair game to touch the same parts of him. I really like to rub all around his cock, but not touch him until he starts rubbing in between my legs. If he's not hard enough for you to feel it through his pants by then, don't worry. He'll get there. 









 This week I fucked a guy I've had my eye on for a while now. We went to a party with a bunch of friends, then decided to leave for another one. We were pretty drunk by the time we left the second party, and then had to make the trek across campus. We held hands and stopped on several benches just to cuddle and look at the stars. We got back to his dorm and sat listening to Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here (one of my all-time favorite albums) while making out. Things got hot and heavy and I ended up spending the night. Next day he and his roommate come to my dorm just because and we ended up sitting cuddled under a blanket outside for hours and hours. Then he came to my room, we laid in bed and watched tv for a while before fucking. He spent the night and most of the day. 

Seems less like a sexual achievement, but I have been afraid to let myself just be intimate without having sex since I got out of my first LTR. I've had hook ups, and a short fling (I had to break it off because I started to have feelings that we both knew would never be reciprocated), but I feel so comfortable with this kid. I'm just going to let it keep happening and see where it goes, but I really think I could let myself get feelings for him without it being unrequited. 

Also, he helped me with my insecurities about my oral skills -- he had to stop me multiple times because I was "just too good at it." 









 This is one of my favorite things to do to a man. I LOVE doing it and looking up into his eyes as he gasps and moans. But maybe I'm just weird. 




 We can't help you Doug, we're too high. 




 I also am diagnosed with GAD, and I have tripped a few times. I dropped acid the first time three days after a massive panic attack, and it went fine. It may help you to write on yourself. I have seen people put "don't panic," "it's just the drug," or "enjoy yourself" on their arms. That can really help, because, if you get lost in your own head, you can look down and see the words. 

As has been said already, don't let yourself be alone. It is good to have a sober person with you, so that you have someone who knows to watch out for you. I think LSD and other psychedelics have helped me figure things out, including the sources of my anxiety.

I hope it turns out well for you. 




 This! 
And boys, if you didn't know why they put that warning on the stuff, its because, when you have a boner, the blood is trapped in there until you soften up. While the blood is trapped, it can't bring fresh oxygen to the cells in the penis. After four hours, a lot of those cells will have died. After long enough, the entire penis will die and, ultimately, fall off.

 Even better, just poke holes in the bottom of the bottle. Also, spray some febreeze into the sploof. 
























 Perhaps I just had a shitty therapist, but all I ever got from it was "you have a chemical imbalance in your brain, sucks, don't it?" Therapy just made me focus more on the stupid things, trying to figure out why they bother me. It ended up making me feel super self-absorbed, to the point that my very best friend told me to either change or get out of her life.

I worry less about what other people currently think, but rather what they may do if I pursue a certain want. 

I suppose my biggest concern with this philosophy is that it seems like it just makes us all into selfish little twats. All I want to do is help people less fortunate than I, but I get so caught up in how I might be hurting them that I just assume that everyone is better off without me. I know it's not true, but that little voice is constantly telling me I'm a burden or a bother. I've been getting better at pushing it aside, but sometimes I just can't see the point, if it's just going to come back.

Tl;dr: maybe I just can't not give fucks, when my ultimate goal is to help others. 




 I've been lurking on this sub for a while now. Every post is full of "your problems don't matter" or "just do it" or "be confident."

It isn't that easy. Anxiety is part of my identity. It's like telling someone with clinical depression to "just be happy." It's pointless, and a little bit offensive. I checked the sidebar, and in the "how to start not giving a fuck" post, literally all of them seem like completely insurmountable goals. How do you go from not knowing what self-confidence feels like to being super confident all the time?

I'd love to take your advice. But it's like telling rabbits to stop fucking and pooping. 




 That is my issue with this whole sub. I know I shouldn't give a fuck, but then I just get hung up on doing that. At least for me, not worrying about things takes away one of the only constants of my identity.  




 And if you can't control your own basic bodily functions, there's no way in hell you can consent, no matter how much you want it. 




 So you might fit into a 32" and a 34", depending on the store. That still seems more reasonable than fitting into a 2 one place and a 9 somewhere else. 




 I can see where they're coming from. I live in Southern Indiana, aka meth land, and knew a handful of kids who cooked in high school. It's an awful drug, and those hooked on it will do anything to get/make more.

That being said, I think this is a little extreme. You can still go buy Sudophed (sp?), just not boxes and boxes. Maybe putting a cap on the amount you can buy at a time would work better. 




 Dissociatives are not fun (in my opinion). Instead of passing out, expect to be having conversations with the giant spider on the wall or freaking out cuz you can't find your bread.

Edit: also, a benadryl overdose is serious business. Seizures, vomiting, coma, etc. Source: I took an od of it on purpose and am literally the only person who's been in my hospital for one, had seizures, and didn't die. Maybe I'm just paranoid, but don't fuck with this stuff. 




 They may be driven to have it cuz it feels good, but that isn't the reason. It's a biological imperative that happens to feel good. If it didn't, horses would go extinct pretty quick. 




 Yes, it does. When I make potent cookies, it makes the place smell like grandma and dank. Not safe to do until you've got your own place. 




 I had a buddy who turned it into a game: take a standard drink each time they say standard drink. Have fun ;-) 














 I'm not sure about him, but I (also from the midwest) could find a zip anywhere between $275-$315. 




 I decide what I want to make beforehand, and then get so excited at the prospect of fresh pastries. It's also been a bit of a zen activity for me for years.

The dough for these takes about six hours, so there's a lot of down time to get more stoned or watch some Netflix.  




 For the dough I just used Julia Child's croissant recipe. For the filling, I put some berries, sugar, flour, and lemon juice in a saucepan and let it cook and thicken over low heat while I rolled out and cut the dough. Use water around the edged to seal. Sorry I couldn't give a legit recipe, I usually just wing it.

 Madame. Madam is the head of a brothel.  









 Julia Child. I'm not sure which one has the most pastries, but french pastries are my schtick. 









 This is the best advice on this topic I've ever heard.

OP, everyone has to deal with relationships that just aren't right. And it hurts, because unless you're a sociopath, it really sucks to hurt someone else. I had a terrible, controlling, legitimately insane SO for a while. I loved him more than I could possibly say. I still do, even just for the good memories we made together. But we just weren't good together. "test_subject2886, shut up, you're about to say something you know nothing about" was a common thread. When I finally realized it wasn't working out, I agonized over the decision for weeks. I felt guilty for months afterward.

I've now been away from him for a year, and it was the best decision I've ever made. No one deserves a shitty relationship, but they help us figure out better what we need for a healthy, thriving one. So buy yourself some Ben Jerry's and remember that you've gotten through this frog, so you know you can do it again if you have to.

Tl;dr: we all have to deal with bad relationships so we can figure out what we need. 




 Sounds similar to my best Goodwill find: a vintage suede fringe jacket for $10. Looked up the tags online, turns out it's worth at least $300. I live for deals like this. 




 If you work it, as you clearly have been. Congrats!

 The other discussion is more relevant and informative, but from my experience this isn't necessary. I've never had a UTI, and I never make it a priority to pee right after sex. 




 Make sure to eat a lot of yogurt or other things with probiotics to prevent a yeast infection. The antibiotics for the UTI can mess with the levels of bacteria and yeast in the vagina, which can in turn create a yeast infection. Vagina problems are the worst. 









 That pretty perfectly describes how I am when I don't smoke weed. Clearly ymmv. 




 I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and panic attacks on the regular. I am generally worried about something all the time. I smoke a spliff every morning when I wake up to calm myself down. Sometimes I get paranoid, but it only ever has to do with avoiding getting arrested. I have never had a panic attack while stoned. Just my two cents. 




 And a decent amount of them probably do, too. 




 That's my protocol as well. Also I don't ever seriously consider stupid tattoos. 




 Some places just don't have schwag. I can't even find mids in my town, and I've got several dealer friends.

 So, long story short, I make really idiotic decisions when it comes to boys.

I got played like a card by this guy for six months and all I have to show for it is a diagnosis of major depressive disorder and a short hospital stay. I decided it was a great idea to Facebook stalk him for a little bit tonight, and I ended up bawling my eyes out, just like every time I see or think about him too much.

I know that drinking my problems away will be bad in the long run, but tonight I'm killing what's left of a fifth of Captain and realizing that his new girlfriend is probably smart and funny and everything I'm not, but still holding onto the fact that she makes Sarah Jessica Parker look like she doesn't have a horsr face.

Tl;dr: fuck boys, fuck Facebook, and fuck ugly bitches.

 I'm going to give an opinion right now that I know is incredibly unpopular in this subreddit, because it's worked for me many a time.

I enjoy faking orgasms. I am a fairly orgasmic person, though. Usually what happens is that I'll be able to tell that a guy is about to come, and I start contracting my muscles. Doing that (depending on the position) also forces my hips into a position where my clit is getting stimulation, and seeing the guy feeling me get close usually sends me over into a real orgasm.

I have completely faked them during random hookups when I just knew that it wasn't going to go anywhere, and I don't find a problem with that. If you don't care for the person, an you know he won't be inside you again, you can do whatever you want, because the next person he sleeps with will be different from you and he'll have to learn how to please her specifically. 




 Hello all!

Today I splurged a finally got myself a bottle of Seche Vite. I used it straightaway but have a few questions. I searched and a few questions were resolved, but these ones I couldn't find answers to.

I didn't run into this today, but if I need two coats of a polish to get it opaque, do I need to let the separate layers dry before putting on the next coat, or should I do them all quickly and then seche on top while they're all still tacky? I don't mean between base color and art, that question has been resolved time and time again, I mean with light colors that require more than one coat to be opaque.

Secondly, how thick is a "thick coat" of SV? I figured it meant pretty think, but I got bubbles in it today. I know it isn't from the polish underneath, because I didn't see the bubbles while I was waiting for the polish to go from really wet to slightly tacky.

Thank you all so much! This stuff really is magical. 




 Maybe something to do with Doc Counsilman, the IU swimming coach back in the day who practically invented kinesiology as it relates to sport training?

 Also, I definitely turned this over for the picture and poured a little bit of vodka that hadn't evaporated from my last shot on my keyboard. Still seems to work fine.

 As someone who goes to college in their hometown (townies FTW!), I just ask my parents to let me have the car for a few hours as I load all my shit into four loads max in order to move back after the breaks.

 This afghan has gotten big enough that I think it will stay home. And the constant work has made my wrists hurt, and I can still get a good 8 hours of work done outside of the 4 hours I have class. 




 Hello all!

I am working on my first afghan ever, which I hope to give to my grandmother for her 92nd birthday on 3/15. I started it on Saturday, and am already making a lot of progress. However, I still think that I'll need to spend every free moment to work on it to get it done in time. 

I brought it to class with me today, because I've got about an hour in between some classes, but it is already so big that it takes up so much space in my backpack.

How do y'all deal with traveling with a huge project? Is there a magical folding technique I could use? If not, do y'all have any tips for bringing a project with you to places?

Tl;dr: how can I bring the afghan I'm working on with me without taking up a lot of space in my backpack? 




 Also, should I make sure to get a non-declawed cat to match my current non-mutilated one? I dont want any injuries. 




 Hello, another question. I trust Reddit on cat information.

I'm planning on adopting a new cat this Friday, because my 10.5-month old needs a friend. I'm planning on getting someone a little older than her. Do I need to make sure to get separate food for him? My current kitty is pretty much done growing at this point, and has started eating less (I fill her bowl up twice a day and she hasn't finished it in 30 minutes anymore), so I was wondering if I could start the switch to adult food yet. Or, could I feed a 12-15 month old kitten food for a couple months? I can afford getting separate food, but it would be nice if I could use the same.

Tl;dr: getting a new cat, hopefully not a kitten. Could I use the same food with my 10.5-month-old as a more adult cat? Either switch the current one to adult food or give the newbie kitten food. 




 This. I usually just spray it on my hairbrush and pass it through a few times, especially on the underside.

 I had a friend with epilepsy (or some other seizure thing) and remember the first time he had one in front of me. I'll tell you, it isn't pretty, although you can probably imagine that. We were out for a smoke and all of a sudden he looked out to nowhere and next thing I knew, he was on the ground seizing. My lifeguard skills kicked in, so I got him to the safety position and got someone to call for an ambulance, cuz it was his second that day. It was so scary, he didn't know what year it was, who the president was, anything. You're description helped me realize just how out of it you get. 




 I've heard that the bitter apple stuff or whatever doesn't always work. That's why I went for the polish first. 




 So, I posted a question a couple weeks ago regarding computer cords and that foul tasting nail polish designed to help you quit biting your nails. 

I've been putting a coat on a couple times a week and my cat hasn't chewed on my charger at all. I saw her try when I first did it, and she was licking her lips and I could tell that she had an unpleasant taste in her mouth.

Hope this is useful to anyone else. It's been a great solution for me.

Tl;dr: if your cat chews on your charger cords, coat the cords with Bite-It and it will help. 




 This may be better suited for the general discussions thread, but this stupid cold has got me thinking.

Does anyone else have old long sleeve shirts that are way too small to wear on their own, but make the best cold weather undershirts? I've got a black one from my goth phase (7-8th grade) that I've had on under my sweaters all week. Like, I know the shirt itself looks silly, but layers are awesome. 




 We had to put my family dog down 5+years ago, and this brought a tear to my eye. If I weren't broke, I'd give you gold. 




 That's literally the only way I can get the motivation to clean. I go full-on 40's/50's housewife. 




 Thanks! My sister says the clips were a free add-on when she ordered the brushes, and I don't eat chips, so I figured I'd put them to good work. 









 Less thought out than the earlier comment, but I'll give my two cents.

When I want to make a pattern, I just make a second of the same project. I write down what I remember doing for the first time, with plenty of room for notes. As I work up the new version, I change the blueprint as needed.

That said, I've only written three or four patterns before, and it was mainly to keep track of things when I was making big projects.

Wool leggings from REI, neon t-shirt from Michael's, homemade black cowl. 




 I don't have the money right now for a new one, I'm probably going to put a little away until Spring Break. 

Should I put my current cat's litter box near the door? The only viable option in my apartment for that would be to have the litter box in my bedroom, in front of the bathroom door, and I would almost certainly step in it.

If I put two hanging toys on either side of the doorknob, would that help socialize them when I'm in class?

I plan on going to the shelter fairly often to play with the available cats, and see which ones have similar personalities. I just think someone with almost as much energy would chill her out so much, because she's always running around and trying to play with everything. 




 Haha, when I brought my Katie home for Thanksgiving, we heard her meowing for almost an hour and didn't see her, which is unusual. Turns out she was in the cupboard with the trash can, and she didn't seem phased at all. 




 I've searched, so I know the basics of bringing a new cat home, but my situation leaves me with some questions.

Katie is a 10-month-old barn cat. She's been with me and strictly indoor since she was 12 weeks old, but she is sassy and spastic as hell. We've had playdates with other people's cats, and she has always terrorized them, even though she's tiny. My best friend's 13 pound Mane Coon hides whenever they've been together. 

Is she too much of a terrorist to adapt to another cat?

Also, my apartment only has one inside door, in the bathroom, and my bathroom is tiny. To keep them separate for a bit, would keeping the newbie in the bathroom be ok?

Katie lived with two rabbits for a couple months, and got along great with them, but I'm definitely not getting a rabbit (I lost so many cords in my 2.5 months of living with rabbits).

She is seriously tiny. She's maybe 7 pounds, was the runt of her litter, and hasn't gotten any bigger for a few months.

EDIT: I'd go to shelter and see what's available, but I think getting a fixed male between 8 months and 1.5 years old would be best. I think she'd get along better with a rambunctious friend who's bigger than her.

Tl;dr: I think my cat could use a friend, but she's always terrorizing any other cat she's met. My apartment is small. Could I get another cat and keep him in my bathroom? 




 Background: I am a political science major, and have wanted to work in the public sector for as long as I can remember.

 Great! Maybe I can save my oil, then. 




 Ive had incredible luck when it comes to acne/clogged pores. I wash my face every time I shower and have never had a serious breakout.

I'll prolly just use my vegetable oil, because most of the benefits of coconut oil I already have: my hair grows too fast; I use henna to dye my hair, which conditions; I don't scar too bad. 




 I've searched both here and /r/MakeupAddiction, and couldn't find an answer to this specifically.

I've seen a lot of posts saying sugar+olive oil is a good lip exfoliant, but I usually don't keep olive oil in my house (my family has a history of low cholesterol, so I use butter for everything). Would sugar+vegetable oil do the same thing? I've got vegetable oil for in case I decide to make a cake from a mix.

Tl;dr: does sugar+vegetable oil exfoliate lips as much as sugar+olive oil? 




 I'm planning on getting a nude lip liner when I go grocery shopping next, because mine ran out. For every day, I'd be more careful and use a brush, I was just excited to swatch these. 









 One of my best friends has worked at a pet store for 1.5 years, so I definitely asked her. Like I said before, I'm going to try the Bite-It, and if that doesn't work, I'll go with something citrus.  




 Katie may be teething right now, I've read it happens several times in the first year and she's been chewing on everything much more in the last month or so (even the corner of the bag of kitten food), so hopefully it will pass. But I've got several options now. 




 Yeah, my problem is that she pretty much only chews when I'm not watching, which makes me think that she knows not to do it. 

I'm trying the Bite-It for now, but I've got lemon spray too, if I find her chewing. She tried earlier and was then licking her lips to get the taste off, and I'm guessing the tiny bit she might get from that won't be too bad for her. 




 Thanks!

I'm worried, because I've heard several stories about bitter apple not working, and my baby chews on or licks pretty much everything.

Would lemon wood polish spray work?

I'm going to ask the guys at the tech store when I get my new charger. 




 I asked a similar question on a thread in /r/cats, but you ladies (and gents) might know, too.

My 10-month old kitten chews on my MacBook charger and ruins it. I'm going to buy my third in a month, and at $80 a pop, it's getting expensive. She only does it when I'm not looking, which makes me think she already knows not to do it.

Can you coat a charger with that foul tasting nail polish designed to help you quit biting your nails? I think that would deter her, but I'm not sure if it's safe for the charger or the cat. I know not to use anything spicy, but no-bite is just chemicals that taste horrid (I've used it, and the spicy kind, which just made me want to suck on my fingers more because I love spicy food). If not, I can get some bitter apple stuff, as /r/cats suggested, but it's a long hike followed by a long bus ride to get to a pet store here. Maybe Kroger would have some in the pet department.

Tl;dr: cat chews on power cord. Can I coat my new charger in no-bite to keep her from ruining another? 




 I know this is an old post, but do you think coating the cord in that foul tasting nail polish designed to help you quit biting your nails? Would that damage the cord? I'm about to buy my third MacBook charger in a month, just because I take away any short strings so my baby won't choke.

EDIT: I think she knows not to do it, because I never see her chewing, but when I come back inside after a smoke, the cord is ruined. 




 I've been crocheting for about 10 years now. My mother taught me the basics, and I just figured the rest out for myself. About 4 years ago I finally realized that what I had been calling single crochet was actually a slip stitch, and my double crochet was actually single. 

I've tried following patterns for things in the past, and the things always end up too big or just strange. I can kind of read them (at least, I understand the whole "ch4, slst into first, ch1 and dc into next st, repeat 4 times" thing, but nothing ever works right.

That being said, I have successfully made hats, socks, scarves, and even a dress with my limited knowledge. If I want a fancy stitch, I can look up the stitch itself and then incorporate it into whatever I'm making. Patterns can be nice for a basis (I needed on to figure out heels the first time I made socks), but I find it much easier to just do my own thing. Increase, decrease as you need to, but once you know sc, dc, inc, and dec, you can make anything. Anything that requires a close fit, just make sure to fit check every couple of rows (when I made socks for the first time, I slipped them on even more often) and don't be afraid to undo a lot of work if something didn't go well (I also had to redo the toes on my first pair of socks ~6 times).

Idk the point of this post, really, but I searched for something similar, and nothing really came up.

TL;DR: you don't have to be able to read patterns to make things, you just need to be willing to do fit checks super often, and to pull things out if you realize what you're doing is wrong. 




 I've made several. First, measure from your waist to however long you want your skirt to be. Then, measure around your waist and every couple of inches going down the length. Divide each of these numbers in four. Cut two kinda funky rectangles that are as long as you want and as wide as you need at each point you measured. I usually put dots at each measurement point, then connect them. Using the same measurements, cut the front on the fold so it will fall flat. Sew all the rectangles together, put a zipper in the back, hem, and voila!

This is how I always make them, although having a waistband could be nice, too. There are better tutorials with picture online. 




 Munster is around 4.5 hours from me, but I've got some friends from the region, so I'll ask them if they'd be down for a trip. Quite a few Three Floyd's brews are available near me, so at least I've got that going for me. 




 I'll be on the lookout for all of these. Since I can get Harpoon cider, I'll bet I can find others. Thank you!

Edit: my Kroger had Harpoon ipa, and it's pretty good. And def good for a beginner's ipa 




 I'm in southern Indiana.

Edit: but my health food store has a huge selection, but a large portion of it is international.  




 Hello all! 

I decided for my new year's resolution that I would become more of a beer connoisseur. Both my local grocery store and my local health food store have really excellent build-your-own six pack selections, so I've been picking up one or two of those a week.

To be honest, I prefer a good cider to just about anything (Harpoon Craft Cider is my favorite thing ever), but I also like a good beer. However, most of the selection at Kroger is ipa's and apa's. I'm really not a fan of pale ales, or really anything that is super hoppy, but I'd like to build a taste for it.

Wheat beers are probably my favorite, and Upland Wheat Ale is one of my favorite beers, although that might just be because it's widely available where I live. Of the mix-a-sixes I've made, my favorites were Baltika #4   9, Two Brothers Ebel's Weiss, and Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat beer.

What are your recommendations to start my journey away from dark lagers and wheat ales?

To;Dr: I would like to expand my beer horizons, especially when it comes to pale ales and strong hoppy flavors. What do you recommend?

EDIT: the mix-a-six at my Kroger today had both Founder's all day ipa (which wasn't the best) and Harpoon ipa (which is pretty good). Thanks for the suggestions, y'all! I hope the health food store is open the next time I want a mix-a-six, because I know their selection is better.

EDIT 2: I also got some gumballhead, which is a good beer for those in my situation, who love wheat beer and want to learn to like hoppy beers. It's a good middle ground. 




 Yeah, my hometown's population is less than 4k. And a lot of my friends are from even smaller towns. 




 I've come to the realization that I am a boring individual. I have no hobbies, I don't branch out, and I'm sad most of the time.

I go to class, then I sit and watch Netflix and get drunk until I go to bed. Due to injuries, there are very few physical activities I can do without immense pain, and the only other things I do for fun (crochet, baking) are entirely solo.

I've been dating around, looking for someone I have anything in common with, and simply haven't been able to. I thought it was because I hadn't found anyone I'm really interested in, but that's not it. It's because I have nothing to have in common with someone.

TL; DR: I'm boring, and I don't know how to change it.

EDIT: Thank you all for your comments. Unfortunately, I just started Christmas break, but you all have helped me think that maybe I should just go do things. 




 Hello all!

I've been invited to a holiday party for the office where I worked for a year. I quit in August, because I was too busy to continue working there, but I still think I should make an appearance, because I loved the job and it gave me so many connections.

As background, the office was on my college campus, and focuses on educating the public about Congress. My boss was a former Congressman. The party is for every faculty and staff member in the department, which include my former Congressman boss and a former Senator from my state.

While I've been told by several people that faculty parties are generally not super fancy, I believe that this one is a bit different. In the year I worked there, I never saw a man out of a suit and woman in anything other than business. My office was business casual, but I was usually the least well-dressed person there, even in pencil skirts and cardigans. 

I recently slipped on the ice and dislocated my knee, and am finally off crutches, but I don't think that I can handle anything other than sneakers or snow boots. However, I think I'd be able to switch into nicer shoes for the small amount of time I'll be there, and I've also got a pair of nice black, flat oxfords that would be acceptable. It is from 3:30-5:30, but I'll have to leave by 4:30 to get to a final.

I have a few ideas as to what to wear. I've got a deep purple velvet dress, which I usually put with mustard tights and brown heels, as well as a huge number of different colored pencil skirts, which I'd pair with a nice white button-down. Any advice you could give me would be very much appreciated. I'm broke, so I can't buy anything new, but I have a few things fancier than what I usually wore to the office.

TL;DR: Holiday party tomorrow from 3:30-5:30pm, for faculty and staff of a school in which I worked in an office for a year. I would assume business casual to semi-formal, except to attendees will be a former Congressman and a former Senator. HALP! 




 I made my dresses both years, so they are just sitting in closets at home. Since they were made to fit me perfectly, I didn't even think about donating them. Junior year, I didn't even get it finished, and had to sew it closed onto my body. 




 Lost mine, but omg it was the cutest lighter ever.

I hardly go on /r/trees anymore, because it's so filled with boys (not men) and posts that just don't interest me much, but this post came up on my front page yesterday, and it got me thinking. I've pretty much only had dates recently from dating sites, because I'm too awkward to actually ask people out in person (unless I'm high, and I don't like being high in public). My profile talks about Mary Jane, because it's a big deal in my life, and I usually only respond to people who also talk about it, or at least have answered questions by saying that they smoke. 

Do you ladies look for men who smoke? I often do, like I said, but that is far from enough to make me want to be with them as anything but smoking buddies. Also, have you ever experienced being "put on a pedestal?" I have some female friends who talk a lot about how they get to smoke for free most of the time, and that they have joined a group of men smoking a bowl, just because they wanted company (this was mainly true when all my friends and I lived in a dorm and we had a smoking area for cigarettes that most of us used to smoke weed), and have been passed the bowl without asking and after having said that they were just out of a cigarette or company and weren't trying to be smoked out.

TL;DR: Do you specifically look for men who smoke when trying to find someone to date? Have you ever experienced being "put on a pedestal" for being an girl who smokes? 




 Thanks! It wasn't due after break, I just worked a lot on it. It's for an incomplete I got last fall, and I have until the end of the semester to submit it. I'll say that it'll be pretty dense, but if you're willing to proof a comparative analysis of worldwide campaign finance, I would appreciate it!

EDIT: The piece is named Godric, for obvious (to me) reasons. I usually smoke rolled things, but I ran out of papes and this bowl holds about the same amount as the spliffs I roll. 




 While it doesn't look as good as it could, it tastes amazing and buttery and eggy, as brioche should. If anyone's wondering, the recipe is from "The Roux Brothers on Patisserie." A lot of the other recipes aren't great, and with this one I still add a bit of nutmeg and a tiny bit more sugar, but I love the book simply for the amazing food porn. 




 Thanks. I wish I had a baking sheet big enough to not have to shape the braid into a circle, but it still tastes amazing. 




 It's the tiniest bit overdone, but not burned at all. My recipe calls for double eggwash, and this was my first time making a double batch. Not the prettiest, but still tastes amazing, as brioche should. 









 I've been dying my hair with henna for seven years now. It is permanent, and conditions your hair/makes it shiny. I do it myself and buy the powder in bulk at the health food store, so idk about doing it at a salon. Just make sure you use pure henna and do a strand test. Some heavy metals in some brands react really badly with dyed hair. Like, melt your hair off bad. 









 My cold sad outfit is wool leggings, wool socks, and a baseball-style top I cut to be off the shoulder from the golf team from my sophomore year of high school.

Warm sad/hungover days are Paris boxers and some random tank top.

When I want to go out and feel really sexy, I have this royal blue pencil skirt that my friends and I call "the skirt," because I have literally never worn it and not been hit on hard. 




 Not exactly what you're asking, but I usually layer a few pairs of tights for warmth and opacity. 




 Everyone in my family asks for my chocolate chip cookie recipe. Making grandma-level cookies at 21 is one of the things I love bragging about. 




 is just a big ol' mess of nut drunk not drunk not drunk not drunk not drunk HOLY SHIT NOW I'M REALLY FUCKING DRUNK.

EDIT: Omg, I love not having class after noon of Mondays and Wednesdays. 




 Thank you! 




 Thank you! While I don't have any experience with retail, I have been called the Queen of Organization, and I at least think I know my stuff. 




 Thanks! Like I said, I dropped my resume off in July, right after they had done a bunch of hiring. They only called me back last week. 




 Thank you! I think I know my stuff, I've been going to this same shop for three years now, and sometimes get frustrated when the workers can't find something simple. 




 I agree so much, I hate more than anything when the head shop people can't find a simple brand of papes when it's right there. Last year the shop had an influx of hot, brainless female employees, recently they've been better. I don't think I'll fall into that. 




 Hello all! I usually just lurk and comment 'round these parts, but I have a question that I think you ladies will be able to answer better than /r/femalefashionadvice , even though this is usually their territory.

As the title says, I have a job interview at my head shop tomorrow morning, and I am at a complete loss as to what to wear. I know for regular interviews you want business casual, or at least nicer clothes. But the head shop is so different from every other employer I've had, and I want to work there so so badly. The people working are pretty strictly jeans and t-shirt, but I want to make an impression that doesn't scream "she's trying too hard." Even though they dress so casually, I'm still thinking nicer pants (because all my jeans are torn up/worn out) or a casual skirt + tights (because it'll be below freezing when I need to be there) and a t-shirt (probably a Slytherin one I have because it's my absolute favorite and I feel so wonderful in it), but I'm not sure if even that's too casual.

Thank you in advance, I know you ladies know how to help another entwife in need.

EDIT: I'm also meeting the owner (whom I've never met, even though the employees know me by name and know exactly what type of papes I want), and the interview is at 8:30am (not at all hard for me to be awake for).

tl;dr: I've got an interview at my local head shop tomorrow and I have no idea what to wear. HALP! Please.

EDIT 2: Thank you so much for the help, everyone. I had the interview this morning, ended up in the black pencil skirt + black tights + Slytherin t-shirt, and I think it went really well. If anything, I showed how punctual I am, because I was there 5 minutes before the interviewer. 




 Commenting to save this pattern. I usually hate amigurumis for some reason (possibly because I already own way too many stuffed animals for a 21-year-old), but this hits right in the childhood. 




 I have a beautiful coral eyeshadow that is sadly not very pigmented. However, it's perfect for dabbing on over concealer, under foundation. Kinda cancels out the purple blue (mine are a little green cause I'm really warm toned). 




 Hopefully you'll find a coat with long enough sleeves! I'm just here to say that long wrist warmers under mittens are wonderful for that awkward uncovered wrist. 




 My birthday is on the 28th, and my best friend's is Nov. 2. Birthday Halloweek has been a thing for us. This year we're 21, so it's basically just an excuse to dress up, get wasted, and eat our body weights in chocolate all week without any judgement. 




 Slutty Teddy Roosevelt. Don't have an SO, which is ok, because I don't think anyone will be able to outdo Slutty Teddy Roosevelt.

Part of the reason that's my costume is simply because I believe that the words "Slutty Teddy Roosevelt" should be said together as many times as possible. 




 Rimmel Lasting Finish lipstick in Pink Blush. I describe it as my baby prostitute lipstick, cuz that's what I feel like when I put it on. I always try it again every few months, and it's always just awful.

I generally feel like a baby prostitute if I try any pink lipstick, though. I'm sticking to red or bare from now on. 




 I really only have one pair of sneakers that I can wear. Since I'll have to walk to the venue and have really bad knees, cute shoes are pretty much never an option, sadly. 




 I'm going on a second date with a guy I really like tomorrow. We're going to a comedy show at night. What do I wear?

For background, I wore a white skirt, grey tights, a grey sweater, and a pink scarf for our first (coffee turned into early dinner) date, and am thinking pants for this one because it will be cold. I've got most of the basics, and I absolutely love cardigans. Would skinny jeans+cute printed t-shirt+cardigan be too casual? 




 I've gone through two pairs of 5fingers and I love them so much. I had a grey/bright blue pair that I wore nearly every day for three summers, and a grey/strange army-ish green pair that is nearing the end. 

I'm generally less concerned with how my feet look because (due to years joint damage) if I do, my knees/hips/back hurt badly enough to not get out of bed for a few days afterwards. However, I just treated my vibrams like any other shoe. The green pair works really well with all the earth tones I wear, and I think all black Mary Jane-style ones are some of the cutest things ever. They really don't look much different from other black shoes, and if someone is seriously disturbed by them, they need to figure out why feet are so "gross." 




 (Partially to deal with the oh-so tacky see-through leggings) I always wear two pairs of leggings, which usually makes them much warmer! 




 I'm not a vegetarian, but I often cook big dinners with my friends, many of whom are.

My favorite non-meat protein sources are edamame (green soybeans) and the combination of peas and pasta (together they make a complete protein.) Edamame is great because you can put some frozen beans in tupperware and they'll be thawed and the perfect temperature by lunch. 




 Don't worry /u/vickivoracious I wasn't offended. 




 Actually it's glass. Hooray for shower ledges! 




 Girls are, in fact, on the internet. 




 I made it a little too strong, and I love the triple bitterness. 




 I wanted a picture of it, but didn't want to risk getting my phone wet. Be assured, it was drunk in the shower. 




 It takes the refreshing part of showers added to the refreshing part of drinks. 




 Shower Gin and Tonic is even more refreshing! 




 You got it! 




 The gin was brown. Would have preferred the clear kind, but lack of funds means you gotta go with plastic bottle Seagrams. 









 "A rebellion is always legal in the first person, such as 'our rebellion.' It is only in the third person -- 'their rebellion' -- that it becomes illegal."

 I love taking a long hot shower during the comedown of LSD and MDMA. 

I'm a little afraid to try it in my new apartment because the water doesn't get very hot and sometimes I'm a little bitch when it comes to lukewarm showers. 




 I'm going as slutty Teddy Roosevelt. Because.

 Maybe it was just me, but when I was getting drug tested I got pee on my hands every time, and it was my own pee. So getting some on your hands won't be an issue. Just say you aren't used to trying to aim. 




 That's what I'm reading! 




 Mixing another drink every time you need a break from Plato is a great way to get wasted on a weeknight. 




 Perfectly describes me. Also, I mainly go on dates with guys who smoke anyway, so it works out. All ents smoke before going out to eat. I usually have a spliff rolled up for when we meet, then we'll walk to wherever we're going. 




 And what about difficult last names? Mine only has two syllables, but I get people assuming it's one all the time. 




 If the password for "Sit on my face" isn't "and tell me that you love me," I would be very upset. 




 My ex boyfriend not only continued to use my parents' account after we broke up, but (at least I'm pretty sure) then changed the password himself so none of us could. Luckily, we were able to completely reset the account after my dad couldn't sign on one day.

He also didn't sign out of my friend's account on his Xbox until he invited her over and she saw him using it.

You don't even want to know how insane this boy is. 




 Down in btown we've been getting medicinal from Michigan and Cali (believe it or not) for a while now. No one I know has any idea where to even try to find mids. 




 IU ent (born and raised just outside Bloomington) here, the college towns are oases of intelligence in a bass-ackwards sea of methed out ignorance. 




 I don't forsee a democratic governor in my lifetime. Moving the hell out of this state as soon as humanly possible. 




 I've never understood how calling me independent is supposed to be an insult. 




 1) seriously, go to class.

2) take anything and everything that seems interesting, at least at first, to find something you're really passionate about. I'm a junior picking up Arabic because I like languages.

3) read for class and do your homework. 

4) learn to take good notes. This means (at least for me) outline style, with the main points copied from the PowerPoint and subheadings from discussion.

5) no matter how dumb you think you might sound, speak up in class. This is especially important in language classes, because it allows your professor to help you with pronunciation and grammar.

6) eat dinner at Collins. Or just go to Collins as often as possible. But I'm biased on that front (lived there for two years).

7) take a class with Aurelian Craiutu. Seriously, this guy is the best there is. He's Political Science, but teaches other classes, too. He will challenge you and won't accept bullshit. I took Modern Political Thought with him last semester and am taking Classical in the fall (Y382   381, respectively), but he also does a class on happiness that I want to take so badly.

8) don't commit dormcest. It WILL be awkward.

9) your UD advisor is going to be shitty, no matter what. Deal with it, cuz you won't need him/her for long.

10) DON'T. EVER. SMOKE. WEED. IN. YOUR. DORM. ROOM. EVEREVEREVEREVER.

Edit: 11) get a job at some point, even if it's just for a summer. You don't want to graduate with a four-year-old resume, or worse, no resume at all.
