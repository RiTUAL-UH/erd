 I was raised with very limited cooking and food health knowledge and I think this might be a good forum for myself and others. Examples of food facts can be anything food related that you think people might not know, such as: spinach has more protein per pound than steak, or to keep your egg yolk from overcooking when making over-easy eggs poke a small hole in the egg yolk once you have the egg off the pan and on your plate. 

























































































 besides the obvious (healthcare, dental, etc..) what kinds of free stuff are we getting from work? 





























 Because it's humerus. 









 So I am bipolar and just recently started up on my meds while at the same time quitting smoking cigarettes and pot. Its been about 4 months now and my dreams are becoming more and more lucid. Any tips for a new lucid dreamer? Has anyone else here had the same response to these meds? 














 Perhaps atheism is taking a subconscious hold on our youth. Think about what it stands for, you only live once. A denial of an afterlife! 


































 Layman here. I want to be more excited about this thing because I am a science fiction geek. How is this going to affect future technology?  
























 Who's with me on this one? 




 At the end of ME3 you have a chance to meld with Liara's mind in this sexy galaxy scene where she hugs your arm. I am now replaying a new career, and when speaking with Liara I find out that their species mates with any other species of any sex by exploring their mate's minds and their genetic material. Could Shepard's genetic material live on in Liara? Does anyone remember if Liara survives in the end?  









 Mine is the M-11 Wraith shotgun. Small clip size, but very powerful, accurate, lightweight, and very quick to reload.  









 Were you even playing the game? I've almost finished, making mostly a renegade campaign, and I am deeply affected by the choices I've made. I lied to the Wrex about the Genophage, wiped out the entire Quarian fleet and watched the wreckage burn like fireworks in the sky of their homeworld, mercy-killed an Ardat-Yakshi, watched Tali kill herself....all because of choices I have made (or didn't make). I would say in comparison to ME1 and 2, the choices are much deeper in ME3, more emotionally connected. I really like playing the renegade campaign, and found it pretty easy to play along in ME1 and 2, but in 3, I really can feel the emotional impact of my choices. I can't be the only one who finds this a masterpiece of space opera. 

[EDIT] I'm going to get drunk and finish the game tonight so I'll post later and tell you guys my final assessment..but so far its been pretty fun. So far I've gotten my moneys worth.  




 I suggest you buy it.

 My roommate felt robbed after beating the game on the Wii. When I was a kid, I always thought the best part was when you made him bleed red blood , blooooody red blood at the end. Why is the Wii version green blood? Green blood stupid. 









 Nobody gives a fuck how many old cartridges you own.  



















 Three things concerning Halo and it's sequels (anyone else feel this way?) 

1. When I'm over at a friends house and the only multiplayer game they own is Halo, I instantly lose some respect for that friend.

2. When I am forced in a situation where I must play one or two minutes of Halo, it feels as if I am defying one of my base morals, and I lose a little respect for myself.

3. WTF? Another Halo? Doesn't anyone realize how much Halo sucks, and how awful it is compared to this generation's FPS (single and multiplayer) greats? 

In conclusion, HALO SUCKS BALLSAKS.  





























 Yeah because I'm sure he does this to ALL of his pumpkins, you twit

 How do you sleep at night knowing that your profession revolves around the carnal sins of humanity? What do you contribute to the world other than pain?

 Hey it's been fun. I hope I make it to 77. Hopefully by that age I have my shit figured out.

 Personally I feel like some of the things posted to /r/gaming that are labeled "No Spoiler" are in fact spoilers. They are not spoilers because they give away story, they are spoilers because they give away crucial gameplay elements that would have been fun to discover on my own. Now, if it was a movie, any talk about the movie before you have seen it is a spoiler because a movie is a linear thing, it goes from point A to point B and if you give up something in between that line it's a spoiler. A video game on the other hand, or any video game worth its salt, is a non-linear dynamic media that somebody interacts with. I get pleasure out of discovering things about a game, about the little nuances and side-routes. I make it a point to never read a walkthrough guide until after I have beaten the game by my own wits. For example, I saw a "Last of Us" post about how it is a survival horror game with no scare jumps. Well great, that takes away some of the suspense I might be feeling when I finally play it. Or, on a post I have made a while back I labeled as a "Minor Spoiler" because I told people the best way to kill a Cazador in New Vegas. But people complained, said that it wasn't a spoiler. But to me, it definitely was because when I found out how to do that on my own a whole new world of gameplay elements opened up to me in New Vegas. So...I leave it to you...should we modify the spoiler policy or am I just bitching to the wind?

TL;DR I think that certain things labeled "No Spoiler" are in fact spoilers because they give away gameplay elements.  











































































































































 "Private" 





























 That's a lot of responsibility for such a young one. First thing he has to do is take his human for a walk, that kid is a porker! 









 In your life and travels, what has been the most magnificent object you have held in your hands? 














 Explain to her that the majority of matter and energy in the universe has a tendency to slow down, and that she matters because she lives in a time and place of active complexity, that the life she is living is not a slowing down but a speeding up---technology, sciences, space exploration, human awareness---its all becoming more and more complex,  adding on to each other in a beautiful way, going in the opposite direction of 99.99% of everything else that exists.

 I am happy. Especially now since she asks me to pause movies and gives me many blowjobs. She is actually sucking my dick while watching me type this and eat pistachios. 




 Courtesy does not fall squarely on the shoulders of one half of a relationship. I want to feel like I'm watching a movie with someone, not just next to them,  you dig? Besides, if we do pause it for them do we get thanked?  









 Go away you pretentious windbag 









 I absolutely hate your character on the show. Who the fuck let this college dropout hacker on our super secret spy plane? Oh wait, it's cool, she has tits. I hope Skye dies off, soon.

 Its like standing on a beach during a violent storm. Your thoughts and outside noises become unbearable and you are constantly being hit by giant waves of negative emotions with no definitive source.

 This guy is totally bullshitting that he will "never ever" pick up a video game again. Plain and simple bullshit. The technology is only getting better. A game/system/hardware will be released that will make it impossible to refuse.

 I'm a hateful cunt when it comes to something that is completely unhealthy and terrible for humanity. All those things you mentioned have absolutely nothing to do with health,  you cunt. 




 Someone here obviously cannot read between parentheses.  




 I say keep on hating. Hate is an acceptable, natural response to something that is terrible for humanity. And the fact that we let fat people live on without shame to keep on making more fat, bratty kids is absolutely terrible for humanity. 




 Juat rain. I swear we are raising a nation of wimps.
