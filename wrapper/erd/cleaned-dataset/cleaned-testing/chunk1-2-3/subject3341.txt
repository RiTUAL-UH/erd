 Anyone see the guy grab his dick at the end?  




 Works for me on Google Chrome.  




 Those original game cube controllers must have cost you a fortune on Amazon... oh wait, yes it did. 




 He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector... a Cat Knight.  









 Should be The Last Of Us.  




 Does anyone notice her leg on the left is facing the wrong way? If you pulled your leg all the way back like that her knee would be touching the top of her head...

EDIT: Never mind I see it now....
 




 Well that escalated quickly. 




 I think this has more to do with your tastes maturing rather than just the fact of more exposure. If I hate something I hate it no matter how much I'm exposed to it; only if my tastes and attitudes change will my opinions change.  




 No. Just no.  




 Skyrim Total Enhancement Project (STEP). Search it up and follow the directions for a much more beautiful game.  




 Sounds like you need new friends.  




 CATERPIE!!! 




 Mission Impossible 4?? 




 What kind of girlfriend uses sex as a bargaining tool? 




 and the first? 




 The Playstation 2 could: play all Playstation 2 games ever made.

YA DON'T SAY 




 Guy was caught jerking off in the library. Apparently he had came into a few books before.  




 "Black" 




 Pikachu main, here. I use the c-stick for quick down smashes (roll + down smash is king). Whenever I want to charge a smash I use direction + A.

I'd say it's more personal preference than anything, I know some great players who don't use the c-stick at all. I have found, though, that all the insane players I know ALL use the c-stick. So it would seem that it is your friends that are the noobs and you that are the pro. 

C-stick is also invaluable for directional air attacks. Pikachu's are amazing, so I use the c-stick A LOT for that.  




 Your sister is a certified qt3.14 




 Iguana meet this girl. 




 Why girls need to lie about this stuff is beyond me.  




 WHERE'S THE C-STICK? I NEED MY C-STICK 




 You come across a child drowning in a river.
Would you rather save the child's life and have no one know what you did, or fail to save to save his/her life (even if you could) and be forever known as the hero who tried? 




 In Asian countries they have a plastic bin right next to the trash meant for liquids. Why they don't have that here is beyond me.  









 More like scumbag EA. 




 This is such an obvious shop it's not even funny. 




 Why is this in cringepics? 




 I see what you're doing... 




 Hashtags. 




 Your picture actually made me say "oh my god" out loud. First post in a LONG time to make me do that. Congrats. 




 Not on campus, but pretty sure I might have seen it off campus near Shadyside or up Craig Street. Lots of buildings that look similar close to CMU.  




 You are NOT overqualified for anything. Get your ass out there and work! 




 The Social Network. Epic, touching, Harvard and Trent Reznor. 




 haha sorry, I actually am almost out. I know quite a few people who have more than a hundred dollars left though :) 




 This design was submitted.
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29374/Sample.png
Who could possibly say that the design that was chosen is better than this one? The quality of the submissions was not the problem here. 




 Not very good, the teacher is pretty bad and doesn't teach econ very well. Fortunately, I took AP Micro in high school, so I was able to do well. 
It's not a particularly hard class, so if you're able to get through her B.S. teaching you'll be able to get an A.  




 I can't believe CMU ended up with this design. With our amazing design and arts school, I never expected this would happen. 
The petition that was created the first day of voting did nothing, and the creator of the petition was told to take it down because it might offend the creators of the design. I highly doubt anything we do at this point would be able to change anything.  




 it's bytes, like I said CMU's internet is INSANE. 
and Donner looks super ugly from the outside but it's pretty nice inside.  




 I live in Donner, which is really nice, coed by wing (west and east), largest rooms for a double, walls are pretty thick here. Apparently Stever is considered one of the worst freshman dorms so if you liked it you should be fine anywhere. Morewood has the smallest rooms though, almost tiny compared to mine. 

The internet here is AMAZING, I get ~13 mbps download speed on WIFI which in my opinion is incredible. Yes, sometimes it cuts out randomly for like half a minute but it's infrequent enough that it's not a nuisance. Ethernet is the most stable, never ever had it cut out but I get slower download speeds ~10 mbps. You have a 50 Gb download limit for 5 days but you will never EVER go over it, I download large files constantly and have no problem (I once redownloaded my entire steam library and was fine). There are gaming clubs, not sure if for CS:GO but I'm sure you could form one easily.  




 Red 9. You won't be eating very much here, even though there's no buffets except Shatz they give you a lot of food. I'm a dude that normally eats a lot and these blocks fill me up to the point where I only need to eat two meals a day and a few snacks I can buy at entropy. Red 9 gives you $720 DineX which is more than you should ever need (most people don't use it all, and I actually have to make an effort to spend all of it by the semester).  




 go live in any asian country 




 he tried to hit backspace to delete the "i" but he hit "=" instead 




 I heard they gave out 2,000 tickets but they only have space for 1,500... I doubt even people with tickets will be able to get in. 




 Read, sign, and spread my petition. https://www.change.org/petitions/cmu-id-design-2013-2014-choose-better-designs-for-cmu-s-new-smart-ids 
























 Yeah my garage has been duplicating my cars too... weird.  




 From what I've heard the Surface 2 is only a few hundredths of an inch thinner than the Surface RT, so thinness isn't really that big of a difference. Apparently the weight difference is quite nice, though I haven't had any problems with the weight of my RT. I got my 64 GB RT for $200 and I feel no incentive to upgrade to the 2 except for the better screen. I think $250-$200 is the perfect price point for the Surface RT 




 I have the AMD Radeon HD 6630M and I can run at at 40-50 fps. Just run it and play around with the settings a bit.  




 Surface RT runs on flash memory, not a hard drive, so the slowdown shouldn't be from there. Did you run Windows Update multiple times? The updates fix a lot of the lag/slowness issues.  




 Those floors are only accessible by CS students. If you have a friend in the CS department, just have them open the door for you. The elevators work the same way too. 

Or you could get lucky and "conveniently" walk in after someone opens the door.

2. My Killing Floor for his Half Life 2
3. http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1mljpn/h_killing_floor_3_copies_steamgift_w_offers/ 




 I can do Half Life 2.  




 In order of interest: 

* Chivalry: Medieval Warfare
* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
* Max Payne Bundle
* F.E.A.R. 3

Willing to trade any or all my keys for any of these games 1:1. Or counteroffers I'm not particularly picky.  




 I have three copies of Killing Floor as Steam Gifts, includes the game and Defence Alliance 2. Looking for any offers.  




 Just give IE a try. I was skeptical at first too but it really is a great touch experience in tablet mode.  




 Realistically, what do you use NFC for? And why is it so important that if it doesn't have it it's a deal breaker?

Not bashing, just curious. I think NFC is a great tool but I haven't found any practical applications of it that would make it a deciding factor in purchasing a tablet or phone.  




 MathXL puts the CORRECT answer in the box after you get it wrong, so the answer in the blue box is NOT what you input. If you mouse over the box a window will pop up saying "Your answer: _______." I'm sorry but I'm 100% certain you input the y = which is technically an incorrect answer.  




 Well the y = is already given... so technically you DID input the wrong answer. 

I know, I hate MathXL as much as anyone else, but you just gotta learn how to deal with the annoyances.  




 Bought one of these and it did come in original packaging. It arrived packaged and presented as if I had bought it direct from Microsoft.  




 TI calculators, like the TI-83. They were invented 14 years ago and they still cost $100.  




 Really? Send me a link for a flashable rom? 




 Can't believe Sense 5 is on a Samsung Galaxy product before the HTC Evo 4G LTE and the HTC One X.... 




 I will be in an efficiency.  




 Sounds awesome, thanks! 




 Yeah I realized that as I was going about my business today. TJ Maxx also sells pans and dishes, too. 




 Refunded the whopping 1 cent they paid.  




 Well I'm still going to be going to Target anyways, no way I can bring all that stuff in one carry-on :P 




 Thank you! Did they really give you a dining table and a couch?? 




 Yup, I know that. I wouldn't expect them to give that to us. 




 What appliances are included in the Fairfax kitchens? Fullsize fridge, oven, stove, microwave, sink? There's no information on the housing page.   




 New Facebook cover photo right here. 




 Stark didn't say it was vibration proof, he said it *absorbed* all vibrations, meaning the shield can still vibrate but none of that energy is transferred to the wearer. Big difference.  




 I see. In which case decide whether a college degree is really worth it to you. If you foresee yourself getting a better job/being happier once you get a degree then go for it. I don't want you to be like "well what do I do now?" after you graduate.  




 You should go only because of the fact that it's a unique and rewarding experience. College is a unique experience because everyone there is living together and striving to achieve the same objective - the only other place like that is the military. The lessons, skills, and friends that you have there makes it well worth your time.  




 There was an incident that happened during Orientation Week at my school... it is now known as the "Brown Leg Incident."

During the first night of school a guy invited a girl to his room, and they began to get down and dirty. His roommate was trying to sleep on the top bunk and got so fed up that he left to sleep in the lounge. One of the RA's walked by and asked him what was going on, and together they went to investigate the room. 

While the two lovebirds were alone they had switched to anal sex, and were going at it full force when his roommate opened the door. The shock from the door opening and the ongoing sex caused her to unleash her bowels in full force all over the guy's leg, and due to crappy school food it was runny and full-on disgusting. We all ran out of our rooms from the sound and saw the couple covered in shit and fully embarrassed. 

Both students switched dorms after that.  




 On the thumbnail it looks like his nose is made of a dirt block. 




 Looks like Frogger couldn't handle this challenge, either. 




 I've always felt it was the other way around... Name a few games where you think this happens? 




 DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAAAAAAAAY 




 Sounds like your girlfriend's a keeper. 




 Just because someone uses those services doesn't mean they don't like face-to-face conversations. 




 AWWW HAAAAAAIILLLL NO 




 .... How did this happen?? 




 Insidious. The most terrifying thing I have ever watched in my life.  




 Lifeguards will give you so much hell if you bring those to a public pool. 




 It's pretty obvious how to use this machine correctly, too.... wow.  




 I think you should stop replying to his texts outright... To a guy, any response means that there is hope that you will actually get with him.  




 Pikachu doesn't even know what's coming... 




 DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAAAAAAY 




 stoopid hooman... 




 Could have put the rupee ocarina in a pot and had him smash it, too. 




 Typical rich, preppy white girls with Macbooks and Coach bags. Doesn't even look like it's raining that hard. 
























 "Destitute Tier" haha 




 He doesn't really do a lot of fast action stuff except for the small amount of fighting at the end (that he doesn't do very well in). I'm sure you can get a clean, smooth picture but I'm most worried about the lag making it impossible to play shooters or faster paced games. Thanks anyways though.  




 My god look at that tiny HUD size. 




 How playable is it? Is there any lag/is it manageable?  




 What is that spectrometer at the top? 




 Oh my god, those visually similar images.... 




 Her facial proportions are a little off and frankly a little off-putting to look at (pic 7). I've seen a lot of Asian women and they don't look like this.  




 Does Tepper really need a new building? How about renovating something else first, say, Wean?  














 How do you get Samurize to work? Are you still on XP? 




 You have to install all available updates first before it shows up in the store.  




 Just try not using your laptop for a while and see if you can live without it. Only you can tell whether it will be a viable replacement for you.  




 No. 




 I think it's time to look into the pros and cons of using each product in real life rather than just the pros and cons of the computers themselves. If you're gonna be bringing it to class, the Alienware is going to be WAY too huge. I'd go with the blade. In my experience with college, portability and battery life are just SO incredibly important. If you do get the Alienware I would look into also getting a companion tablet or light netbook for you to bring to class with the money you save. They're both great computers that serve slightly different purposes (powerful all around computer vs. desktop replacement). Make your call while considering your lifestyle (do you plan on sitting in your room or going to the library to do work, lan parties with friends, etc.) and how you plan on using your computer (take it to class or leave it in your room). 

Also, technically it's not their first PC, as they have the Razer Blade Pro that was released a few years ago.  




 Even a $30 is WAY too much to spend on a screen protector. Just get a $5 to $10 one if one at all. I don't have a screen protector on my RT and it's just fine. My type cover protects it while in my bag.    




 Future economist right here.   




 Could be a one? 




 Let's blatantly overgeneralize an entire subset of people, that'll go over well.  




 It's a sorority hand sign. Forget which one in particular. 




 The Blade Pro is an outdated system by now. The new Razer Blade is the one you want to get. Switchblade is an old gimmicky system that most games don't support and is a feature I'd pay to get RID of, not to have. There's a reason they haven't updated the Pro/added Switchblade to the new Razer Blade.  














 I also have a stand-alone mic, not in the Picture. One of those Yeti microphones.  




 I do have Razer Surround, it sounds great.  




 I have it dual-booted to Ubuntu, I just need Windows for gaming.  




 This keyboard is AMAZING, much better than any membrane or chiclet keyboard in my opinion. The only downside is it's VERY loud, really clacky especially if you type fast (of courss, this could be seen as an upside to most people). If you have roommates or if you think you'll be bothered by the sound I'd recommend asking for the Steath version which uses different switches to be quieter. Personally, it doesn't bother me or my roommate and I kinda like the sound it makes. 




 Not sure? It's just a background I found when browsing google images. Link the the wallpaper has been provided on this thread already.  




 Yes, I have a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50s. I am interested in getting a pair of actual gaming headphones, though. The Razer Kraken 7.1 looks really nice at a reasonable price.  




 It's a Cooler Master Notepal U2 Laptop Cooling Pad, found [here](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834997730).  




 Yes, I LOVE this keyboard, I had the 2012 model before and just recently upgraded to this one (2013) with the Cherry MX Blues. It is very noisy, and I do have one roommate. Fortunately, he doesn't seem to mind it unless he's trying to sleep and I'm still up typing something. I guess it just depends on who you have as a roommate.  




 I made the Rainmeter skin myself, I will be posting it on /r/Rainmeter soon. Look for it there! 




 I do use my laptop screen frequently, but I would be interested in getting a stand to slide my keyboard under when I'm not using it. Thanks for the idea! 




 It's a skin I made myself actually. I am thinking of posting it onto /r/Rainmeter soon. Look for it there! 




 I prefer it for sure. It kinda braces your hand and wrist and allows for finer mouse movements. 




 I'm not really sure? It's been a long time since I've had it installed, so I don't really remember.  




 I am studying hard; I go to one of the country's best Computer Science schools. This is just a small hobby of mine, I don't intend to build some insane computer-built-into-desk-with-liquid-cooling-and-leds system. Just some suggestions on computer placement or small changes or some stuff that I haven't thought about would be nice.  




 Yeah, I re-installed windows and didn't install the beats audio drivers after. Honestly, beats doesn't sound all that bad on my laptop; I even think it makes the sound from the built-in speakers sound better. You can disable the equalizer and tweak the bass and stuff so it doesn't sound bad. 

But yes I do have it completely uninstalled and it sounds pretty much the same.  




 It's windows 8 with the programs Rainmeter and Stardock Objectdock. Objectdock gives me that menu on the left and Rainmeter gives me the bar on top and right side and the date and time in the middle. 

I actually have my laptop dual-booted for Ubuntu, which I prefer over Windows 8 for web browsing and stuff like that. When I want to game I switch over to Windows.  




 It uses a lot less bandwidth than Skype does, so in that sense it's better. Whether you like the sound quality is up to personal preference; Razer Comms tries to make your voice stand out above in-game audio but it can make it sound a little harsh and unnatural in my opinion. Just try it out and see what you think! 




 [Here](http://wlppr.com/wallpapers/2010/06/14/Slides_of_light.2880x1800.jpg) you go! 




 I would totally get a different desk if I could, but as this one came with the dorm I would rather stick with it. Plus I wouldn't have a way of keeping the desk for next year. For now, this is what I have.  




 HP Envy 14 Beats Edition. Not exactly the best laptop, it's about 2 years old. Definitely getting a new one soon.  









 Is it just me or does this cat look a little like Wall-E? 




 I see what you did there.  




 This article talks about having the battery *constantly* at 100%. As long as you let the battery go through charge cycles decently regularly (let the battery discharge to maybe 20% at least once a month) you shouldn't have an issue with reduced battery life.
