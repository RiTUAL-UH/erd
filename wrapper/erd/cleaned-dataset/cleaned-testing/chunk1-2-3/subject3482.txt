 Either works well. An accounting and finance degree is more immediately practical for that specific job. An econ degree, especially from a good school is more respected even beyond banking since its a harder degree. Either way for banking, you need to follow the templatized recruitment process and network hard. 




 Yes. Its possible. You need to network hard and be in NY a lot. The other responses are spot on that the best place to start is your alumni network. Join your college finance club and do things like training the street to get up to speed on valuation / modeling, etc.


 









 fine :) I take it back. It does get expensive and its a continuum of costs as you look to get further certifications and rack up flight hours.

My new answer is get Microsoft VBA certified. Nothing says "popular with the ladies" like Microsoft VBA certified 




 I agree. it can range. It was a long time ago and prices have gone up since then. The point being that its in that range, is relatively non-cumbersome to get a VFR and is a very fun hobby that people like to learn more about. Also I think its likely cheaper  to get in SoCal than Canada (but maybe not $5k any more) 




 You are absolutely right. Salary depends on a lot of things. 

If you are asked a salary requirement in a form at the start of an interview process - just leave it blank. There is almost no upside to giving them a number until you are close to getting the job.

When you are close to getting the job, they will typically call and ask you for a range or number. There are a range of negotiating techniques but the most effective one (proven by studies) has been found to be a range, where the salary you are willing to accept is the low end of that range, and your top end of that range is  10-20%  over that. Typically your current salary should be below that range because presumably your switching costs involve you not wanting to move for the same pay.

Quote the salary as all-in. i.e., basic salary + bonus. Benefits are important but somewhat secondary. If their benefits package is weak, you should tactically let them know that during the negotiation process if thats important to you.

 Yeah I just meant VFR. I think all great hobbies cost time and money to really pursue but the question was just for a skill that was cool, cheap and quick. A VFR fits those requirements.  









 If you live in places like Southern California, its not that hard or expensive to become a private pilot. It costs ~$5,000 and takes 40 hours of lessons to get the basic pilot certification. 

I know thats relatively expensive compared to the other things people mention below, but its not much for a really cool hobby. People always want to chat with you if you are a private pilot.

EDIT: This post previously said 40 years / I meant 40 hours. Typo. But candidly, y'all are an impatient bunch.  




 I run a career website http://tapwage.com

We have curated collections of jobs and career articles completely free. I'll readily admit that there are many free job sites out there and media sites out there. But we are trying really hard to provide a quality job finding and career advice experience. 

For our early users, If you ask us a career question or ask for a specific type of job you are interested in, we'll help you find those jobs or answers.  




 Your resume looks fine but its really useful to make it a little more action oriented so it shows that you care about the results of what you achieve. 

Simple things: e.g., are there certain subjects where you consistently scored As? Can you elaborate on the achievements at your volunteer efforts. How many students did you tutor?

Fix the formatting on your resume. Right now the line spaces are inconsistent and that looks sloppy.

 On its own "ethical investing" doesn't outperform other forms of investing, and sometimes underperforms - for good reasons. Its hard enough finding alpha (outsized returns) in a  relatively efficient market place, its really hard to do that with constraints. Moreover, the best portfolio managers are not incentivized to do ethical investing.

I like how the industry has evolved beyond that to "impact investing". This is more than ethical investing. This is looking at specific areas where you know resource allocation has been awry (for political, social and / or cultural reasons) and using investing to correct that imbalance. 

A great example is funds that invest in women and / or minority founders. Its well known and well documented that women and minorities struggle to raise money from traditional VCs. But mathematically, there is no reason for this segment of founders to under-perform for any reason. So impact investing in this segment has an arbitrage benefit where you can fund underrepresented founders and avail of overlooked opportunities. As the systemic biases normalize though, the alpha opportunities will reduce. But others might come up. These types of investing have shown the ability to perform and outperform the market. That said, it still depends a lot on the quality of investment manager talent that these funds are able to get.

We wrote a guide to impact investing here: http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/06/guide-to-impact-investing

 Impact investing is a really interesting way to look at the world. I don't think CSR fully reflects that wide range of things impact investing is. Impact investing is also evolving so its not just "sustainable investing" or "non profit" investing but like any investing its about finding alpha (outsized returns). There happen to be meaningful outsized returns in areas like renewable energy, sustainable emerging market business models, and investing with women and minority founders who have traditionally found it harder to raise money within the existing VC ecosystem.

 very well put! 




 Supply chain jobs? No. These are resource allocation / analytics jobs that are fairly high end. These jobs can easily pay upwards of $100k / year at many big firms. The tools and data and analytics continue to get more advanced - there is a real focus on big data and using insight driven forecasting tools. Some of the more manual elements of this job will get automated like low-end procurement type roles but that can be said if almost any job (even programming jobs get automated as tools get more advanced). What is likely to happen to these jobs is that they continue to get more sophisticated, require more training and become higher paying.

The other important thing to remember is that supply chain is really the integration and coordination of many different functions that used to be separate like sourcing, manufacturing, logistics, distribution. Massive companies like Coca Cola, Nike, etc. have realized that by centrally managing, forecasting, planning and negotiating, they can save massive amounts of money, and ensure that new products can be distributed instantly where there is demand. The supply chain is actually the central nervous systems of these companies connecting the various silos. Many companies are only just beginning this integration and coordination, which is why supply chain jobs are in such demand. As this supply chain revolution continues - these jobs will continue to remain in demand for a while
 




 no. I just remembered to remind you since sometimes people search for continents and our search isn't fully built yet (focus is on curated collections of jobs). We'll have real time smart searching capabilities soon. We get our jobs from thousands of companies directly 




 Thats really interesting. Btw: my site is in its early stages. Best way is to search for Singapore or Hong Kong (or Kuala Lumpur) on it as opposed to searching for "Asia". We will enable a smarter search soon. 

Let me know if you have questions on moving to Singapore. Its a great place to work and live.  




 Being a product manager is a really interesting job at many companies, especially technology companies because you get to experience the life cycle of a product across various division - finance, strategy, technology, supply chain, marketing, etc.

So these roles can be great stepping stone to broader management careers. I think of product management at a tech company to supply chain type jobs at big consumer companies. These are breeding grounds for future leadership.

The best way to understand what these roles are and what these roles require int terms of experience and skill set is by looking at a range of these job postings and getting a sense from how they are framed. Typically these are for former techies who have some management experience or potentially an MBA and show strategic thinking capabilities and good interpersonal capabilities. These roles liaise with nearly every functional group in the company so great interpersonal skills is key.

Here is a collection of some product management roles:
http://tapwage.com/channel/big-tech-product-manager

I run a career site - tapwage.com
If any of you have questions on these roles and how to get them, feel free to contact me 




 yes, we do. We are adding a lot more jobs in that area soon, but right now, we do have thousands of jobs in Asia across industries / fields. I love Asia. I used to be an expat in Singapore ages ago. Nice choice of continent to go to.  




 We have jobs and career advice for all industries globally. Either way - I hope you find a job you love. Good luck! 




 This is actually a wide range of jobs including supply chain, procurement and sourcing. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple was a long -time executive in Supply Chain at Compaq and then Apple before rising to the roles that led to becoming CEO of Apple.

So what is Supply Chain? It is the planning and management of the supply of a companies products to the market place. Right from sourcing the raw materials, getting them manufactured, handling shipping and logistics to getting them to the right distributors and retailers. 

As companies become more global, products become more advanced and complicated to make (an iPhone involves thousands of components sourced from all over the world), this job becomes really important.

You don't need to study supply chain to do it. Study finance or business, or accounting, or engineering. Focus on numbers and quantitative analysis, join a large organization as a supply chain analyst or procurement analyst and learn on the job. These jobs can pay very well and can give you a unique chance to learn the company and industry end to end and one day rise to a C-level position.

I run a career site - Tapwage.com and have a ton of great supply chain jobs at the biggest brands around the world here:

If you have questions about this, contact me here or on Tapwage and will be happy to give you more guidance 




 I would avoid this. I run a career site (tapwage.com) and we have seen and heard of a lot of instances of this going badly. You potentially get sued or have your reputation tarnished over something that at best makes you slightly more efficient. Not to mention, the recent situation where the Goldman programmer went to jail as a result. 

In general, what you do at work is the employers property, even if it doesn't contain non-public information, so on the whole, I would avoid taking templates or any similar work products with you. Have faith in yourself that you will build better templates at your new work environment 




 Posting to multiple sub-reddits is not an automatic sign of spam. Unclear of the guideline here.  




 I agree with this but sometimes companies frown upon people sending emails home. On my work email and home email, I keep a folder called "Contact Information" and move those emails to that folder as soon as I get them. Then if / when I leave the job, I print those emails out and take with me. 

 














 There are actually quite a lot of interesting data science and quantitative roles that you can search for across industries but sometimes its not easy to find them since they are called a lot of different things. We started a site - tapwage.com to curate job collections to address this sort of thing. A few such channels you can look at are:

http://tapwage.com/channel/artificial-intelligence-meets-financial-intelligence (this has quant jobs in banks for engineers)
http://tapwage.com/channel/data-driven-internships

There is also an article that discusses this in greater detail: http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/08/big-data-means-big-employment

PM / or message us on the site if you have questions and happy to answer further questions or create a custom collection for you. 




 I disagree with the below comments that say that there are only data science jobs in NY or the bay area There are actually data science jobs all over, especially since corporate employers are really focused on this capability.

Check out Data science job collections on tapwage.com to get a curated list of such jobs: http://tapwage.com/?tag=%5B145%5D

 Hilarious story of the guy who asked Quora what job he should choose

http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/07/how-to-lose-a-job-offer-in-10-days 




 Quitting a job is hard. If you have been with a company a long time, it's often like leaving family. I am convinced that a lot of people are so terrified about the thought of resigning that they just put off finding a new job, even if they aren't satisfied with their current one. This post is to help you through the logistics of resigning. Assuming you have made the decision to accept another offer, or pursue something else, follow these steps to make sure you transition from your current role in a graceful and organized way. 

Go to this link to see the checklist and read the article:
http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/07/7-things-to-do-before-you-resign


 




 There are quite a lot of roles you can look at:
1. Marketing or business roles at biotech companies and pharma cos like J J often look for biotech undergraduates

2. Go to a startup. There are many great startup life sciences firms looking for someone with scientific experience but for non-scientific roles and at a startup, you can grow with the organization into other positions.
Check out this collection of jobs here: 
http://tapwage.com/channel/startup-biologist

You could even go to a bank or investment firm and do biotech research, many of which require biotech / scientific experience and undergraduate degrees:
http://tapwage.com/searchresult?keyword=biotech location=
 




 That is a conundrum. You should never tell an employer that you are looking to leave until you actually will leave.

I would actually be honest with your boss. Tell him or her that the reason you had confessed to wanting to leave is because you felt alienated and not socially integrated, but that you enjoy the work and his / her mentorship. Tell them that you have had a chance to think about it and if they are open to it, you would like to stay and build a career. And ask for their advice on how you could do better to socially integrate at work. 

If that doesn't go well, check out http://tapwage.com and see if you can find a better job. Designers are in huge demand and there are great jobs out there. Good luck! 




 AI and Machine learning developers are in huge demand. This is an interesting collection of jobs at banks and hedge funds looking for developers in investment roles:
http://tapwage.com/channel/artificial-intelligence-meets-financial-intelligence 




 Thats not an uncommon route path at all. Most common route to Private equity is via an investment bank. Join as an analyst and after the 2-year program, its very easy to recruit into PE. You can try and do that right after undergrad but its harder.

For Portfolio Management, a CFA helps a lot. Again, these roles are easier after 2 years in the investment banking or sales and trading analyst program. IBs tend to have structured recruiting and big classes and then the PE and hedge funds tend to recruit from there.

 For someone of your experience, your base salary sounds about right but the bonus seems like there should be upside to that number, especially in a city like NY. Without knowing your detailed background, three potential career choices come to mind:

1. Move from a software lead to more of a technical manager / project manager role, either at a large corporation - this may not be much of a premium to your current pay but can offer you better career advancement opportunities

2. Look for a similar technical manager role at a startup (a large startup if needed to avoid overt risk). This might be at or around your base but ideally gets you meaningful stock upside, and there is the chance to handle real responsibilities and grow with the company

3. If you are ready for a bigger leap and do have some business experience / interest to go with it, try your hand at product management jobs. These take you further away from the code but give you a better chance at building a management career if you are so inclined, and therefore the long term compensation potential is better

I have curated three collections of each of these types of jobs here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/code-boss-fortune-100

http://tapwage.com/channel/code-boss-unicorn-startups

http://tapwage.com/channel/big-tech-product-manager

http://tapwage.com/channel/managing-a-startup-product-senior-edition


Good luck and if you have something else in mind, or something more specific, ping me and I can try and craft a more custom collection to give you an idea of what some of the options are.  




 yeah, it might be something like your transferable skill set isn't coming across clearly in the interviews which you can then refine with practice. Good luck.  




 Thats really odd. Do you generally send a thank you email to your interviewer (not the recruiter)? It might be worth sending them an email after the interview with a simple "I really enjoyed meeting with you. I understand that I was not the right fit for the role. Can I trouble you for 15 minutes of your time over the phone to better understand how I could prepare myself better for this role since its one that I am really keen on". Try that with a few of your interviewers and you might get some candid feedback that the recruiter is not sharing with you.  









 what types of corporate careers are you applying to?

There are a few types of careers you could consider given that you have a) people skills b) managerial skills and a history in finance

1. Get a customer experience job at a startup. 
These roles can be fascinating ways for graduates of a range of majors and backgrounds to build a career at a startup and be a part of a fast growing environment. Compared to customer service roles at more mature corporates, these are often critical roles at a startup for introducing the innovative product to a new customer base and helping customers navigate a disruptive and novel experience. These roles can be stepping stones to sales and business development careers as well as other leadership roles
Examples of such jobs are here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/hello-customer-meet-startup

2. Try and get a junior sales job at a larger corporate. Examples of such jobs are here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/rainmakers-with-benefits

3. Try and get into HR / recruiting. You probably have good people skills and these can be great roles to build a career in. A few examples of such roles are here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/people-person-unicorn-edition
http://tapwage.com/channel/get-and-deliver-the-perks

Good luck and reach out if you have more specific questions 


































 Without a ton of facts, on the face of it, 45k seems reasonable at this stage. Its lower than what you would make in a bigger city but its not dramatically lower.

One easy way to check - go on a freelance site like upwork, show your portfolio and see if you are able to command  $30 / hour. (alternatively, try their HTML and CSS tests and see how you score relative to other developers there that do command  $30 / hr). That will give you a sense of whether you are underpaid or not based on your relative skills.   




 You have been here a while. First - get the offer. No point counting unhatched chickens. If you get the offer and you like the offer (better money / responsibility), take it. Try and negotiate some time before you start so you can give your current employer some notice and transition the project. But you do not owe your employer that you will stay till the end of the project.  




 If you are good at sales, stick with it, and build a bigger specialty. Ideally, find a way to navigate into enterprise sales roles (selling to large companies) because those tend to be the most lucrative. Here is a collection of such jobs so you can see the types of jobs these are and the types of skills you need to get.

http://tapwage.com/channel/rainmakers-with-benefits

Good luck! 




 One idea that you may not have thought of is looking at startups in "customer experience" roles. These are (perhaps unfortunately) customer centric roles, which I know might be a problem since you describe yourself as not a people person. However, they are really interesting because you are effectively evangelizing and helping the customer experience with a new technology, so unlike retail, its a more promising role.

Moreover, at a startup, you can break barriers, spend time learning and potentially honing your technology and design skills, and have a career path as the startup grows. Moreover, the positive can-do vibe at a startup might be a good change of pace. 

I have compiled a list of such jobs here so you can take a look and see what these jobs are like:

http://tapwage.com/channel/hello-customer-meet-startup

Feel free to reach out to us on tapwage.com if you have more specific questions. Happy to try and help.  









 It really does sound like you have had a really rough spell. If you like your job, I would stick it out. Cities grow on you, even pedestrian unfriendly ones, and it takes time to build a network of friends and a support system. There is no guarantee that if you did move, you'd love that city either (unless you find a job in a city that you think is 'home' in some sense). Moreover, finding a job is often stressful and frustrating. 

I agree that a downward move will look bad. I think moving after a few months will look bad too, and especially without a great portfolio of work to show. 

Maybe instead of spending 10 hrs a week looking for a job (which is candidly the least amount of time it typically takes), spend 10 hrs a week signing up for a class, or volunteering, or trying something new and fun that might give you the chance to meet some people and settle into the city. 

 




 Sorry I am late to this discussion.

Yours is an interesting background. A career in equity research is a good option and worth pursuing. That said, your easiest path of action is pursuing an MBA from a top 15 school. Big banks recruit at these places and you will get the finance training you need to do well at an equity research role. A CFA would be useful and you will likely need to sit for those tests anyway in an equity research capacity but I agree with the responses that say that MBA   CFA given what you are looking for. I would however, at least take CFA level 1 and 2 during your business school. 

Other finance areas you could consider where you can leverage your healthcare /  bio background is high yield research (like equity research but on bonds), and credit risk management (again a similar role but slightly easier to break into for career changers)

Pasted below is a collection of junior equity research jobs:
http://tapwage.com/channel/picking-stocks

Take a look at these and the types of requirements that they entail and you will get a good idea of what you need for these jobs. If you have more questions - feel free to ping me on tapwage.com and we can try and be helpful. Good luck!

 









 1. I agree with TunaSandwich - better to have a job before you quit
2. I have found in my experience that sticking at your first job at least 2-3 years credentializes you. Also most jobs suck in the first year so its not unusual to not enjoy it
3. There are very few jobs out there that are going to pay 100k a year for your experience and background

Maybe look at other sales jobs: 
http://tapwage.com/channel/rainmakers-with-benefits (a collection of junior sales jobs at large companies)

http://tapwage.com/channel/selling-eyeballs (collection of ad sales jobs)

Do you have an idea of what you enjoy, or are good at? Do you want to get out of sales?

If you are really smart and quantitatively driven, you could consider junior banking and finance jobs. Those pay well and are very intellectually challenging. Here is a collection of those:

It will be tough but try and get an entry-level job at a large company and in general you will get the branding and the internal opportunities to grow a career. Good luck. Reach out (via the Tapwage.com site) if you have more questions  




 Try some environmental focused meet-ups or mixers. When you go to these events, try and avoid asking for a job. Just learn about what they do and bring up your experience and background. Then follow up with a linkedin message or connect after.

Have you tried connecting with people via linkedin? Even if you don't know people directly, I am guessing given your role as an ecologist, you have friends or colleagues who do and you can ask them for an introduction.

Identify the specific companies / departments you want to work for using the websites, and then find someone who know at the company (at any level and in any department) and try and have them submit it to the hiring manager/  HR from inside.  




 I forgot to add LPT pre-fix. Should I resubmit? 









 If you have an understanding of real estate and some finance experience as a loan officer, finding a role at a big real estate firm is a logical step. Look at a variety of companies like big real estate developers (rental and commercial), big data center companies that lease real estate (like digital realty), banks that do real estate financing, and also large corporations that have real estate arms.  Don't limit your choices

I run a career site (tapwage.com) focused on addressing such questions

 It will be hard. Unless you are going to get your degree at one of the top colleges like Harvard or Penn, chances are slim, and even then chances are difficult. There are other great jobs to look at. Maybe real estate finance at a local bank / financial institution. Either way - get moving while at college, try and do as many internships as you can over summers and through the school year and network hard. Good luck.

 Why are you panicking. There are a few different things you could do:

1. Look at startups. They are looking for smart people and are more open to diverse backgrounds. You could use your various skills to good use there. Maybe a data and analytics role given your programming skills, physics background and banking background:
Here is a collection of such jobs
http://tapwage.com/channel/data-driven-mbas-at-startups


2. Consider going to a bank looking for investment management jobs that involve programming. they re often open to physics backgrounds and great math skills. A collection of such jobs is here:

3. Consider going to a corporate and using your programming and analytical skill set. A collection of such jobs is here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/data-driven-mbas-at-big-corporates

4. If nothing else, before you try for Walmart, consider going to  a startup in a customer experience role. These are interesting and your verbal and written communication skills are probably good enough for some of these roles:

 What I thought was romantic at the time: Back in the early days of the internet, my gf at the time and I were doing our respective internships. I had internet at work which was fantastic. She only had access to email but no internet and constantly needed to look things up. So I stayed awake all weekend and wrote her a program that ran on my home desktop computer where she could email  search query and my computer would email the Yahoo or Altavista results (can't remember which) back to her. Then she could email the result link and it would download the page and email it to her as a static html page (the whole web was static html at the time so this was the easy part). 

What on hindsight was actually romantic? My gf and I lived in two different continents. I did 5 years of long distance. We moved to a 3rd continent, and then I moved cities twice, before finally moving in with her and now she is my wife and its been 10 years since we started dating. One of my better decisions.  














 I think its better to do marketing at a larger company, even if that means starting at an entry-level type role. It can be a good career path, a chance to learn data and analytics tools that are increasingly important in marketing today and a chance to get some branding on your resume. Risk with small agencies is that you end up with a decent job but not a great career trajectory from there.   




 What industry? Sales in general? If you have an aptitude for sales (some do, some don't) its very viable. Good sales people over time can either go on to either sell larger and more complex products and make meaningfully more money, go into strategic / business development roles, or take on sales leadership roles. So there is a valid career path if thats what you are interested in.

The same goes for marketing. 

Candidly - your best bet is either to go to a large organization where you can have meaningful career growth opportunities, mentorship and training, or to go to a decent sized startup that is growing fast so you get chances to grow alongside the company. The startup path is definitely more risky.

My advice to you would be to think about how to move to a company that can give you those types of career challenges and get you into more of a business role. You are absolutely right not to want to stay in administration. Sales / Marketing / Biz Dev at the right organizations will never go away and will always be rewarded.  




 Given that you have marketing experience and a marketing focused education (admittedly a minor), there is no reason why you shouldn't try and get a marketing job. 

This is a list of such roles that could be interesting:

You could also potentially look at sales, especially ad-sales which is an interesting and lucrative path. Jobs like these:

If you want to stay around fashion, there are a number of fashion focused startups you could look at as well. These are interesting because they might find parts of your background really interesting, they are more open ended roles where your responsibilities can grow as the company grows, and you can then transition into bigger roles at more established companies.

The way you position yourself in your resume and interview is really critical for any of these. If you come across too administrative focused, you often get typecast into office manager / admin roles. You really need to emphasize the marketing experience, show that you understand the broader industry dynamic and trends and had a more business-oriented role. Emphasizing quantitative and analytical skills over things like HTML / Photoshop will be helpful too (once you veer into HTML ./ Photoshop, people are unlikely to take you too seriously in a more marketing / analytics roles)

 




 Look for some Unity  / Open GL related open source projects on github and try and become a contributor to one of those teams. Having code contribution at a public project is often more impressive and a better validation of your skills to an employer than a private project you might do. Also good experience working with other developers and learning about the more practical elements of development 









 Consulting and Risk management have very structured recruiting cycles so you can apply for those roles but unless you are prepared on the path, its difficult to break into. 

Here are junior risk management jobs:

Here are junior consulting jobs:

For risk management, my advice would be to focus on non New York jobs that are more geared towards consumer risk management since those are easier to get into

A few other potential careers to think about:
1. HR: I know a lot of humanities majors that got a break into the corporate world in an HR role. These can be useful entry points and fairly interesting jobs. Like these:

2. Another option is potentially doing a writing job

3. There are a number of Non-profit jobs here that don't require a masters degree

unfortunately, each of these will take you away from your goal of IR. 

 




 It sounds like you should work at a startup in a data and analytics role. This might give you a chance to leverage your analytical skills but also work in the "core business", and do something exciting. Example of such jobs are here:

Another option is to try and move into impact investing. This is a really interesting career. Will combine your finance and analytical skills with your desire to do something more meaningful for society, traveling and adventure. Collection of such jobs here:

 Sorry that it took a while to come back to you. We are upgrading our search engine on our site to be instant and better. Once thats done I can point you to some interesting opportunities. 

One category of job that could be interesting is financial operations/  business analyst. This is inline with what a few people before said about potentially looking at banks. Some of these only require an associate degree or a GED. They have a real career path in finance and ops, and are less people-oriented and a chance to shape an interesting career

http://tapwage.com/searchresult?keyword=financial+operations location=Florida

Another option is to be an office manager. Also a good job with your skill set, a potential operations and administrative career path and potentially a better pay and perks than retail

http://tapwage.com/searchresult?keyword=office+manager location=Florida sortBy=relevance

We'll have an updated instant search engine by the end of the week so will be a lot easier to search for these jobs and you should be able to find quite a few in Florida / Southwest. 

Hope it gives you a few ideas about where to look.  





























 Roughly whereabouts are you based or what types of geographies are you looking at? We are still bulking up our job database but I can specifically dig in certain geographies if helpful (we just launched the site so would be a great test case for us) 




 The show TwentyTwelve that aired on the BBC (I am in the US. Saw it on iTunes). One of the funniest sitcoms of the last few years. 









 What type of consulting? Could you elaborate on the nature of the job? 




 Business development is one option. This is sort of sales-like but also involves strategic deals, partnership, channel management and can be really interesting - especially at a startup or a more nimble company. Jobs like these:
http://tapwage.com/channel/if-you-start-me-up-if-you-start-me-up-ill-never-stop
http://tapwage.com/channel/unicorn-business-developer

Alternatively, you could look at ad-sales if you have the experience. Its not like direct sales at all and can be a lot more fun and lucrative. Jobs like these:
http://tapwage.com/channel/selling-eyeballs

Finally - you could also look at more B2B / enterprise sales. These are very lucrative and are completely different than direct sales / home improvement sales but leverage your background. But many of these require some specific skill sets / experience so might be hard to get.

 Given how much data science is in fashion, depending on the city, there should be no reason to take a significant payout. Your engineering background will definitely help, as will the fact that you are learning Python and R. But as NotARandomNumber points out, it depends on location. NY, LA, SF, DC are much likely to pay 100k+ than some of the smaller cities.

A few ideas for you:
Data science is a misleading category since that typically involves a PhD. There are a ton of great data and analytics roles out there that don't involve PhD but they aren't always labelled data science

Here are some data and analytics jobs in finance / large banks that you could consider:

http://tapwage.com/channel/artificial-intelligence-meets-financial-intelligence

You could also consider data analytical positions at large corporations (ignore the MBA in the title. MBA is preferred but they are open to quant degrees)

http://tapwage.com/channel/data-driven-mbas-at-big-corporates

Look at operational jobs that specifically value military and naval backgrounds. These can be wide ranging, very interesting and are increasingly strategic and analytical. Examples of such jobs is here:

http://tapwage.com/channel/operating-with-military-precision

May of these will also consider and reward your engineering background
Let me know if you are looking for something more specific with your background and I can try to point you in the right direction. Good luck! 









 Thats a really difficult situation with loans. My #1 advice would be to create a compelling portfolio of writing samples that you can customize for various jobs. 

If you are struggling to get a gig at a big media outlet, try and get a foot in the door with a digital media startup (there are so many out there these days and they are hiring aggressively). 

here is a set of journalism jobs. If you get your foot in the door at a place like Vox or one of the other digital media entities, the pay isn't great out of the gate, but depending on where you life it might allow your friend to cut down to just 1 full time job. Gives you a chance to build a public portfolio, get some visibility and navigate into a more serious journalism role down the line.

 You don't need a liberal arts degree. You just need to write well. If you want to be a journalist, you should, and there are a number of business journalist jobs out there in both traditional media publications / TV outlets and new digital media outlets. 

Look at these jobs here:
http://tapwage.com/searchresult?keyword=business+reporter location=

or this journalism collection here:
http://tapwage.com/channel/reporting-the-news

These jobs generally don't require journalist degrees. They just need good writing samples which hopefully you have. 

Moreover, there are very few reporters with real understanding of accounting and finance so you could leverage your background to give you a leg up by writing about M A, finance, business etc. I would add these to your writing samples so you really stand out for some of these jobs. Good luck! 









 I read it as he jumped in the river to save a drowning frog. That would have been even more impressive.
