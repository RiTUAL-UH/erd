 Newer cars help cars stay in the line and help drivers stop if needed. This will help drunk drivers make it home safer and keep them from being pulled over. Good or bad?

 I'm thinking about going down there. I know a house burnt down before this house was built.  




 My girlfriend, her mother, and I live in a two story house with her 5 year old son. The house is in an area that is prone to flooding so the house was built raised off the ground about 6 feet. It's a nice house, but it came with an unexpected visitor.

I noticed early on that something was going on in the house, that everyone else seemed obblivous too. When walking by the stairs on the first floor I can see a black shadow person standing at the top of the stairs, sometimes even walking by up there. Also when on the first floor we can hear footsteps walking around up stairs, everyone jsut blamed it on a creaky house. It likes to peak down from the space that the stairs meet the ceiling. I tried telling everyone about him, but I'm just crazy right? My girlfriend asked me once to check her tires and see if they needed any air in them. So of course i went straight to teh car and checked the tired and noticed a few of them needed some air in them. I walked into the garage and the air compressor was plugged in an outlet and was running. We happen to all be outside at the time doing yard work.

I noticed however that I wasn't the only one in the house that noticed our frequent visitor. My girlfriends son could see him also. He would come running into the our room every so often crying that a man in his room woke him up and scared him. I ran downstairs to his room to see if there was anyone in the room but it was just an empty dark room. when i walked back to our room I saw a shadow walk by the stairs on the first level. I quickly ran down there to stop the intruder but there was noone down there but me. All of the doors were locked so there was no way someone could have entered the house. My girlfriend chalked it up to bad dreams, but I knew what was really going on. Evetually it became like a ritual of her son running into the room crying.

This weekend I noticed her son was outside talking to himself. Thinking how its cute to listen to a child talk I listened to the conversation.  He was talking to a locked entry way to underneather the house. http://imgur.com/cPVDPIA "Stop waking me up I don't like you in my room. Please stay down there and don't wake me up." I asked him what he was talking about and said he was telling the man that lived under our house to stop coming into our house because he's very scary. It sent a chill down my spine becuase I knew I wasn't crazy then. Last night I had her son sleep with us in our room, partly so he could get some sleep and partly because I didn't want him in that room by himself.

As he was sleeping he started talking in his sleep. He quietly mumbled that the man was in our room. I sat up quickly and saw the black shadow man standing in our corner. The man vanished but I could hear him walking towards the door. I saw the door slowly creak shut. I ran towards the door and flew it open, jsut as i heard the door downstairs open. As I go down the stairs i saw our back door wide open. As I checked outside the locked entryway was also open and the lock was nowhere to be seen. I closed the entryway to underneath the house, closed the back door and crawled back into bed. My Heart was pumping uncontrollably and as soon as i calmed down and was about to fall asleep her son whispered to us again. "The man said he is coming back tomorrow night to see us.


edit: added picture of opening underneath house 





























 Possibly. I'll try and look it up. That'll be in part two and also when I'm done there too. Check for it in the next couple of days
