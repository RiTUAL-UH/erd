 I get 6.98 MBPS here in Talbot :( 




 The union one has this system where if you work for an hour for them, they'll give you $10 worth of posters. And the work is simple -- hand out fliers or put posters back into their covers etc.  




 Yeah that's what I'm saying. Sometimes things will be fucked up. But that's not a reason to not try. 




 I just made the move, and things got fucked up royally...But while I'm hoping that things get better, I still don't regret doing it... 




 Sounds awesome...But $20 :(

Oh the concerts I'm not going to because of my "Penny wise Pound foolish" policy... 




 I just heard from someone, that it's better to be an asshole with integrity than a nice coward. That's of course, assuming the situation has given you only those choices. 

Otherwise, I completely agree with what you say. 




 Came here to say this -- Chinese Eggplant with Basil Sauce! 




 Maybe I missed something, but how did he know the "teenager" was texting? 




 I think BBC America releases it online the same day as the broadcast now. Not sure because I will be watching it on the 27th anyway. 




 Thank you...that makes sense! 




 Thanks! 




 While I don't agree with you, the fact that the photo doesn't convince you otherwise made me look at the photo critically.

I wanted to convey a feeling of vagueness and uncertainty through the photo. I'm not sure at all if that's coming through.. 









 I came here to say Turkey Run too. I've been camping there too.

Forest Glen is also a good option. If you want to go a little farther (4 hours), Shawnee National Forest is amazing. 




 I'm sorry, but I cried a little there. I wish you the best and hope you make it through. 




 Song of ice and Fire, LOTR, The foundation Series, The Hitchhiker's Guide books, the Space Odyssey Series by Arthur C. Clarke, and anything by Ursula LeGuin

EDIT: Must include Dune in the above list! 




 Been 2 hours, no reply yet. And I'm stuck at work for 2 more hours, so still waiting.. 




 Yeah thanks! I'm the one who's out right now. So I guess, I go back and face the music.. 




 And now I will learn the same lesson, I guess :) 




 Ooh thank you for your logic, LogicalSpider :D It helps that even though I chose email out of cowardice, there might be a small silver lining to it! 




 Oh believe me I tried. And it seems I do have a lack of balls, otherwise why wouldn't I have said anything for a year :) But we'll have to talk about it now...so hopefully the rejection won't be too cruel! 




 Yeah thats the impression I'm getting .. Oh well, my first time! 




 Oh no...I'm hoping we can continue to be friends...or it can't work like that? :O Shit..maybe I should have asked here before the email 




 Oh no, it was a reasonably long email explaining why I took so long and it ended with me saying that we should talk about it ... 




 Well I did say we should talk about it...So I get consolation prize at least .. 




 Yeah true. I did the former...and now it seems like a bad idea! 




 Shit...yeah...but it's been a year...Oh well .. 




 Well it was awkward for me for a long time...so I guess now it will go both ways :) 




 Some showers are good, some not so much I guess... 




 Thanks! 




 Outside 




 You would think  


That if you sat in the bath tub  
Long enough  
With the shower on in full force  


Hot water  
Slowly turning cold  


Your feelings  
All those crazy thoughts  
Would run down  
Your body  


And drain themselves  
With the water  


You would think that  
Wouldnt you?  


But let me tell you  
What really happens  


The water comes  
Hits you  
And then it goes  

  
Well, its water,  
What did you expect?  


Your feelings  
They stay where they are  
After the water is cold  
And you turn off the shower  


Youre the same as before  
Slightly cleaner maybe  
But the same.


 




 You can't replace the beatles drummer. He knew exactly what he was doing, what the song needed and what sounded best:

Example 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axb2sHpGwHQ
Example 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6tV11acSRk

If what you meant that any drummer can play the Beatles songs, then I agree with you. But the band drummer also comes up with the grooves and beats...I think Ringo was a perfect fit for them
 




 Very unusual and well written!  




 Tired, Burnt out  
Where do I go from here  


Hello rock  
Meet my bottom  
Ha ha ha  


Laugh  
Bass guitar plucks on my heart  
I laugh at the...  

The drums start  
Before I complete my thoughts  


Which are slower today  
Because you're in the other lane  
Coming towards me  
Your face going bigger  


I can see the shape of your breasts  
I don't want to look  
No I want to


Hello rock  
Meet my bottom  
Ha ha ha  
 




 Wow...wow..wow.

At first I thought -- Street drummer, is probably just going to play real fast and OP doesn't know anything. Well I'm off my horse! Real musical playing, awesome feel, lots of dynamics, brilliant rolls that aren't just straight Left Right Left Right, a right foot that has a mind of it's own .. a left foot that has brilliant sex the right hand ... 

He better be playing for a real band!! 




 That is way cool! 




 Yes..That was the intent. It was an unexpected moment and I found myself thinking about it days after it happened! 




 Thanks :) 




 
Smile
--------
Her hand was  
Covering her mouth  
As she turned up  
From her book  

And looked at me  
The edges of her lips  
Showed themselves  
From behind her knuckles  
And curled up  
Into a smile

I think the cafe was bright  
And one of the lights  
Was shining in her eyes  

The world stopped  
And then started again 




 Really nice! 




 My friends and I used to use such riddles to play a game. One guy would present a situation and everyone else would ask him question that he could answer only with "Yes", "No" or "Not relevant".

It sounds random, but we almost always got to the right answer within 30 questions. 




 Oh come on, that's just the shadow of the spaceship from Independence day 




 It supposedly works by taking many pics at once with varying degrees of focus, kind of like a compound eye. I wonder if it can zoom. 

Since there are so many mini-lenses, resolution is supposedly a problem. Hopefully they can work that out. 

Awesome concept, really! 




 Oh the Bengal ones sacrifice lots of animals. In the nepal animal sacrifice (which was recently banned, thankfully), thousands of animals are sacrificed at once.

Some of our customs have us cutting a pumpkin and putting red powder in them. This is nothing but a euphemized (okay that's not a word supposedly, but please let it pass) version of animal sacrifice. 




 Yeah, you're right of course :) 

However, it's also important that we don't really have a religious text. Some say the vedas are it (Sanathana Dharma), some say the Bhagavad gita is it (ISKCON), some say there's no text and we're awesome because of it (the moderate ones)....EDIT: To add, there are even some that say that we are not even a religion, only a way of life.  




 Because the facilities suck at all levels. I was in my undergrad team and we had a coach who didn't really care (he wasn't paid much at all, to be fair). Even then, when we once played against a "professional" (equivalent of the third division in other countries) club, we had better uniforms than them. They came to the field by public transport.

There's no money going into soccer. Two of the top clubs in the Indian subcontinent -- Mahindra United and JCT, disbanded recently because of a lack of money. LINK: http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110621/jsp/sports/story_14140274.jsp

And course there's the famous story of the Indian soccer team not going to the world cup because no one sponsored shoes for them. They qualified by default though. 



 




 Oh the caste system exists and is alive and well. People marry in the same caste. People kill for caste. People look away for caste. People get reservations for caste. People get votes for caste. Like you say, the exceptions (us, probably?) don't make the rules

And there are brahmins who eat meat religiously too (fish eaters in the coastal regions), though I agree, they are a minority. I'm a brahmin and I'm vegetarian :) 

Ninja EDIT : I mean, I WAS vegetarian :P 




 Yet there are Brahmins that eat fish (like I mentioned in a different comment). For every "rule" in Hinduism, you will probably find that the opposite is just as true. 




 No. It's religious. There's a lot of pain infliction in our religion. There's even animal sacrifice, though in general cows are left alone and considered sacred for some reason. 




 Umm...actually a lot of Hindus eat meat. Even among those that "do not", some eat fish and classify it as vegetarian. 




 Indian here. Sporting in India deserves a whole other discussion. The national level meets in our country have about as much support and facilities as high school meets here in the US. 




 The pleasures of a pope are none. 




 Depends on what makes you scream. 




 Hey reddit, what determines what kind of pasta will go into a recipe? They all seem to taste the same to me...

I like experimenting with food, so it might help to learn to see the difference! 




 Oh I'm 28 too, don't like what I'm doing, am in a ForeverAlone phase and have no clue what I want to do.

Not sure that helps you in anyway, but if you need company, I'm here! 




 This thread maybe useful:

 Was this actually posted on some news site or is it more like a warning? 




 Descent!!!! Many hours were spent playing this!

I never made it past Level 9 in Descent 2 without cheat codes. Couldn't find the bloody red keycard! Ten years and I still remember it, was a very traumatic experience!

 I'm not american or extremely knowledgeable, but this article still made me sad. It reminds me of the way I'm angry with my advisor (I'm in grad school), but still have to suck up to him sometimes.

 I can't submit comments while using RES on Chrome. I have to start Firefox (don't have RES installed on that) to comment. DAE have this problem? Is there a fix?

 Thank you very much :) 




 Aah..I don't really have an explanation for this. I was looking at/thinking of the sky when I wrote it -- I'm not sure that helps! 




 Thanks! I'll try to post more poems...hoepfully will get feedback on them as well! 




 Oh really good advice! Reading the poem again, I agree with you completely about the claims to pain and torture, especially the narrow perspective.

Unrelatedly, I don't see how honesty and being-a-dick are related, and you're completely in the former zone! 




 The sky is grey

The morning is blue

There's a knot in my stomach

I'm thinking of you


There's no sense in this

The torture, the pain

There's no question if it's worth it

Because I have nothing else

To be worth anything



In my head

I'm fading out

Losing meaning

Each day

I am less than I was

The day before
 




 Who?  




 Whenever I've seen people fishing, it's been with kids :) Though I've seen them catching fish continuously...

 There's Homer Lake (Urbana - 20 mins away) and Lake of the Woods (Champaign - 20 mins away) and Clinton Lake (30 mins away) all of which offer fishing. I've seen many people fishing in Homer Lake for sure. Don't know if you need a license...

There's Kickapoo State Park (30 mins) and Turkey run (90 mins) if you're looking to do some Kayaking/Fishing/Boating/Camping

 Hey, 

Sorry for the late reply, but I would totally be up for next semester. I have an electronic drumkit since I live in an apartment..

I am into pretty much everything, from metal to pop and a little bit of hip hop. These days, I'm listening to a lot of jazz and reggae though I haven't really played anything like it. 
 
Really, any kind of music will do. I just want to actually play with people instead of the computer.

 That just means that she wasn't running as fast she could have without falling down. 




 I'm a reddi. I was born reddi.

On further thought, I may have stopped a sentence halfway there. I tend to  




 Yesterday evening, I realized reddit was the greatest website ever when I saw that these two things were on the same page:

1. The hottest youtube video I've ever seen: [Hot youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs8YthlglKk)

2. An AMA with an astronaut: [Astronaut AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gm8rh/iaman_astronaut_who_has_been_to_space_twice_and/)

So the two most important things in life for me were in the same place at the same time...Couldn't ask for much more in a day! 


P.S : I'm still new to the whole reddi 




 Actually, the poem was written in three paragraphs with the same lines as above. When I pasted it onto reddit, the formatting disappeared, and I couldn't get the paragraphs to work.

However, when I reread it, I saw that the paragraphs weren't really adding anything in the sense that everything I wanted to say, I was still saying, so I let it be.

I'm no poet though and I don't know the rules. I just press Enter when I feel a pause in my thoughts to start a new line :) 




 That's a nice quote. I'm no Hemingway, though I could be the boy. Or the fish :) 




 They are an actual wolf and an actual stuffed monkey, not metaphors or anything :)

Thanks! 




 On the sand

By Michigan Lake

And in the forest

By the sand

I thought

Of holding your hand

And walking with you

Instead of beside


After I moved a log

To make way for the queen

I buried my hands

In my sweatshirt

And played with

The lighter



Yes, the same lighter

That refused

To light our cigarettes

And robbed me of that moment

Where I would be sitting with you

Smoking by the lake

Listening to the clamour of the waves




In the curiously romantic

Silence of winter brown trees

I burned your

Stuffed monkeys tail

And felt the

Pleasant distraction

Of the heat on my palm.



You stopped

In your tracks

To look for the wolf



I looked at you

And lit the flame

on my palm again

---

This is my first poem post here...please criticize freely! 




 Ok wow. I was going to post something similar - actually the same thing. I'm doing my PhD in Aerospace and am currently extremely frustrated. Then I found this...The replies are awesome. Instead of a problem being my first post on reddit, it's a Thank you! 
























 Makes sense...Thanks! 




 It's not hard...I just like to leave the shirt untucked because it gets that way through the course of the day anyway. 




 I've recently tried to graduate from zippered sweatshirts to cardigans/sweaters. The problem is that I like to leave my shirts untucked.

If I do however, the part of the shirt below the sweater looks like a skirt. Is this conventionally acceptable, because I think it looks silly :-/

Should I stuff in the shirt under the sweater or something? If I tuck it in and then tuck it out later, it comes out all wrinkled. 

Any advice will be appreciated!

EDIT: Well, the internet seems to tell me that if my shirt is long enough to be looking like a skirt, it should be tucked in anyway! What do you guys think? 




 Yeah...exactly.

The last few years have taken away a lot from me. I'm prepared to spend many years getting it all back, even if I have to do it one step at a time.

Whenever you feel like you can't go on, just let a few days go by. The weather will change or a grocery store girl will smile at you...I never can tell when it begins and when it ends. When it ends, I exercise... 

Very glad to be of help... 




 I am new to this subreddit, but only because I didn't know it existed.

Reading through it gives me so much hope. 

To the people who post their problems here:

I am truly inspired today by your courage to lay your heart out on reddit and take advice. This gives me hope about me, and tells me that no matter what I'm feeling, there are always people who will care.

Thank you. 




 I tried again and again for 4 years before finally giving up on trying to be confident. After 8 months of soul-wrenching self-reflection and a reasonable amount of hurting myself, I decided the following:

I'll make a small change, and stick to it. I won't worry about any other problem. I can't work? It's okay. I can't sleep? It's okay. I am disappointing people who think the world of me? It's okay. The world sucks and the girl I love is fucking someone else? It's okay. I just turn the other cheek and let the world slap me there. I am a loser and by definition, losers don't win. That's okay too.

As long as I can exercise regularly, everything else doesn't matter. The hope is that once I'm able to exercise regularly, I can take the next step. And some days, I can't get out of my bed. That's fine too. I'll just let those days go by and wait for the day I get out and go to gym.

The point is the hope, of course. Exercise gives me endorphins and for all I know, the endorphins might be what's letting me live.

I post to r/Fitness and get encouragement from there. I see stories on reddit and I laugh. 

I'm not sure what I'm trying to say to you any more. But I went through all that you did. Maybe not or maybe my situation was worse, we can never be sure. But remember it does not matter that others think of you as a failure. 

I am afraid sometimes that my family will see me for what I am and their hopes will come crashing down. But these days, I have learned to accept that too. I am what I am. This acceptance sometimes make me smile and sometimes it makes me punch walls. 

But whatever I am, I will exercise regularly and then sleep well, and then dress well. And then we'll see. Fuck everything else.

I'm not sure I'm getting my point across at all, but I hope your understanding is better than my expression. 




 The hurting is in the front of the kneejoint, especially when I'm climbing stairs.

Thanks for your advice about the stretches. I was doing only general stretches, but will include these specific ones as well. 




 Relevant username? :D 

Okay...I guess I'll take you on your word and try! 




 I have two questions...I'm not exactly new to r/Fitness, but this seems to be the thread where I can ask basic questions freely!

1. I used to be a competitive runner about 6 years back in school (400 m, 800 m, 2000 m and 5000 m), but then I stopped. I started again a few weeks back. I run 3 times a week, 3-5 miles in each run, with an average pace of 7:30 per mile (8 mph). 

The problem is that my knees are hurting. I've just attributed it to not running for a long time, but the pain hasn't gone in 3 weeks. Is this normal or should I be worried?

2. I see squats being recommended over and over. But I don't have a partner and I am not confident of my squatting form. Will I get the same advantages if I use the squatting machine at the gym?

I'm a grad student in university, so have access to good equipment. 




 Thank you all who commented! I will be listening to all of these tomorrow.

 I don't have answers to any of those questions :) 




 I know...thanks :) 




 I would tend to agree with the general gist of your comment, especially the part where I'm putting in more effort than her. But changing that requires changing me, which is a lot of effort...

Well, I am going to take your advice to heart and we'll see how it goes! 




 Sort of..we're flatmates :) 




 I would like to say I don't have enough strength to do that. Circumstances too...but well! 




 No...Circumstances prevent the stopping of hanging out to this day. It's been six months now and I'm very tired now. Where are the other women?! 




 I physically proposed the act and she didn't talk to me for a day. I verbally proposed the act and she didn't talk to me for a week and even cited said physical proposal as a sign of my betrayal.

 Also, I will be there. If you come in, and shout "Reddit!" in a loud voice, I will buy you (or the first person to do this) a beer. 




 Esquire in downtown Champaign has no cover and a live band. 




 Reading through the rest of the comments, I wish this was at the top. I believed strongly in the article till I read this comment. This goes with everything I've learned about nutrition as well. 

I wish they had done a more long term study with more gradual weight loss.
 




 "Put down the damn fork" believe me, is easier for some people than others.  




 No. I think the point is that what you call "lack of effort" is rooted in genetics. While some people use it an excuse, it is unfortunately very true for others.

I think of it in the same terms as depression. What you're doing is equating depression to a bad day. 




 Wow...Can't believe I searched the rest of reddit and missed Fitness...

I see that this article has been submitted to r/science (http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/nuhrp/a_full_year_after_significant_weight_loss_these/) and health...but I subscribe more to this subreddit, and would like to see responses to this thread here. 




 I don't know...If the enemy is dropping pamphlets during a war, which government would want their people to read them?

 Oh wow...I stand completely corrected!! An internet apology and thank you to you, kind sir/madam. 




 Thanks! You have now given me specific words to go find the meaning of...Off I go! 




 I did say "rest of the internet", didn't I? Google is it, and I asked.

While I showered in the torrent of information, I came out only wet, not cleaner.

It's more reliable to ask a forum where people seem to know what they're talking about. 

 




 I'm getting conflicting opinions both on this subreddit and on the rest of the internets. Some say they exercise only the arms and some say pushups are an awesome all-round bodyweight exercise.

Which is true? I have a feeling the truth lies somewhere in between...but well, I can't build my exercise routine only on feelings.

Thanks! 




 My mother is a yoga teacher, and I've heard her talk about this:

There are two different schools of Yoga (I'm not sure what either is called, so I won't take names):

1. Stretch as much as you can - This means go only to the extent you feel slight tension in and then hold that pose. Don't push yourself. You'll eventually get to the point where your heels are on the ground. 
2. Use "props" - This could be a something under your heels so that they are resting. Maybe a pillow. Anything.

I don't know for myself which is better. My mom teaches yoga the first way, so that's how I do it. You'll get better at Yoga the more you do it. 




 The study talked about cancer and heart disease. Is that all health is these days? 




 i know this is probably not the answer you're looking for, but it did work for me: Try to enjoy cooking. Look at it as part of your fitness routine. It is also a lot of fun and very interesting to try out various things.

Start with simple things and keep expanding. I used to cook once a week, and now I cook almost daily and keep trying new things. Of course, I don't make anything that takes longer than 20-30 minutes, but there's a whole world of cooking hidden in that time frame too. 




 To be fair, my mom went against her religious beliefs and out of her way to make sure we got protein through eggs in our diet. She'd never even touched eggs before in her life and still cooked it for us for breakfast.

 




 Came to say this. But then saw it said and realized I don't really like the joke. Sorry HighSorcerer!

The written word truly is different. 




 Ah..Shit! 




 I don't know. I like Sex better than Racing though. 




 That doesn't look half as bad as I thought it would. 




 How was your year? 
 




 About the reason for eating this way: I really have never considered health. My mother is a dietitian in India. She's strictly vegetarian for religious reasons, but allowed us (my brother and me) to eat eggs because she realized as sportsmen, we would not get enough protein otherwise. Come to think of it, she also used to give us Vitamin B-12 capsules regularly. She also did tell me recently that for the amount of lentils and beans we eat (approx 0.5 cups per day) plus the beans and the eggs, she was making sure that we got enough protein as kids. 

While I was not religious at all, vegetarianism stuck with me mainly out of inertia. 

When I went to Singapore once, I was out with friends and had steak and loved it. So I plunged headlong into meatland with gleeful abandon!

However, I am also a poor graduate student. So, I don't eat out very often (i.e. I cook at home) and I don't know enough about cooking meat. And meat is more expensive in grocery stores, so vegetarian it is. I started working out in earnest recently and hence this thread!

Though as I write this, I am having delicious prosciutto with fresh mozzarella and basil.

Sorry for the long reply...Am a little drunk and happy with  my cooking!

Also, thank you for the advice on supplements! I will buy some whey protein next time I visit a grocery store! 




 Thank you! This makes perfect sense! 




 Yes, I'm looking it up...

Look at this article: http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/you-illuminated/201102/does-vegetarianism-make-you-dumber

Though this is about memory...Seems Creatine does not help memory in omnivores, but increases it in vegetarians! Crazy shit!

EDIT: And a similar trend for bodybuilding/exercise: http://www.vrg.org/journal/vj2003issue4/vj2003issue4weight.htm

"Vegetarians have lower levels of creatine in their blood, urine, and red blood cells.21,18 This does not necessarily mean that they have lower levels in skeletal muscle, which is where it most matters during exercise. In one study, vegetarians and meat-eaters took 7 g of creatine three times a day for six days. The vegetarians' power output over three bouts of exercise improved significantly after the six days of supplementation, while it did not change for the meat-eaters.18 In another study of vegetarians, creatine supplementation did not improve power output.22

Generally, a daily total of 20-30 g of creatine, broken up in smaller doses over the course of a day and taken for five to six days, has been shown to increase performance.17 There appears to be no benefit of taking this dose for longer than six days.17 After the initial "loading" phase, 2 g/day maintains creatine levels for at least one month.17 Some researchers suggest taking creatine only every other month to maximize its effects.10" 




 I don't even know that word! But off I go to Google...Thanks! 




 I am mostly vegetarian. By mostly, I mean I eat meat only once in a while, maybe once a week and I was completely vegetarian till a year back.

I am also Indian, which for my diet means I eat a lot of vegetables, lentils and rice. I was always told my required protein comes from lentils and eggs. So I assumed I had everything required for a healthy life from a vegetarian diet.

Looking at some threads on this subreddit however, has given me the impression that I still might need supplements.

Vitamin B-12? I'd never even thought about that before, though someone said milk which I get enough of, I'm sure.

Is there anything else I should be worried about, especially since I started exercising regularly and reasonably intensely (mainly running 5 miles, rowing 2000 m and some dumbbell exercises 3-4 times a week)?
 




 Yeah, I don't want to read the logs either. I just want to have a way of knowing when I move from home to office if I've missed a message.

Chrome does that very well with the Google Talk extension.  









 I didn't realize the mistake there, and kept wondering how the first sentence and the rest were connected! 




 Yes, I have to agree...MFA is a great influence indeed! Thanks to this amazing subreddit, I'm now wearing clothes that fit, and thinking about what I'm going to wear depending on where I'm going! 




 Somehow, your amazingly weird analogy makes perfect sense! 




 In that first link, Beckham looks like he's wearing a towel :O That's supposed to look good? Even if it is, no way I have enough confidence to carry that off.

The second one's cool...

Thanks...that did help! 




 I need some guidelines on wearing a scarf. I've figured out the knots, etc. after watching a few youtube videos, and have on basic question:

Does the scarf go inside or outside the jacket?

Okay two: (How) Does the answer to the above depend on what I'm wearing? 




 Oh I had completely forgotten about the Google Talk Gadget...Thanks! 




 I really like empathy too, but I also like the ability of Google talk to automatically sync chat logs as I'm chatting between my laptop, home and office computer.

I used empathy for a few weeks before I realized that if I forget to sign off at home (which I always do), I miss everything that's said till the time I get to the office, unless I open up GMail and look in the Chats folder.

I know I'm griping about really small issues, but it would be cool if it all worked. And it seems like it should!  




 I recently switched back to Firefox because it looks and feels so much better on Gnome. 

The only thing missing is a Google Talk extension. I don't want to open up a page of GMail because I have thunderbird running all the time anyway. Chrome has a Google talk extension available that runs in the dev version with panels enabled. 

Are there any alternative solutions for Firefox? 




 Also, looking for deals on the Transformer always gets me more results on Transformer toys.  




 Oh shit, me too!  




 I did nothing all year. 




 The version on the album is more than 9 minutes long...and when listened to as part of the whole album, is a completely different listening experience. 




 This be very good advice. Going to class and doing homework not only lets you learn better, but also gives you good work ethic.

I took the easy road in undergrad, which has made my current road very thorny indeed. 




 I really can't get myself to do it. Was supposed to be coding, but here I am...I've lost my whole week :D I installed StayFocusd on Chrome and Leechblock on Firefox. The extensions lasted about two days before being disabled!

And I'm sure I'm not the only one. 

Part of the problem is that my work depends only on me and how much I can motivate myself. But I'm sure there are still solutions. 




 Yup...doing that right now! 




 That was unexpectedly pleasant! 









 So it happened again tonight as well? The power plant must be going full swing for the winter...  




 Yeah that's what I'm thinking too...But then it must be hell for the people close to there! 




 Does anyone else hear that loud continuous noise that's been on for the last hour or so? I thought it was the wind, but when I opened the balcony door, it sounded more like a big engine.

 




 I would love to exchange stuff too...Email ID pritamps+writing@gmail.com 









 Really? That's complicated Math? That's some of the most beautiful concepts you can find expressed in a cool, simple form...
 




 Well, Mint's numbers are higher on distrowatch, so it's a reasonably good rumor to believe.

Distrowatch numbers don't mean anything of course, so I would tend to agree with your statistics. 




 I posted this question when I was new to reddit, and didn't get any karma. It made me hate everyone. 




 I have light grey jeans...thanks! :) 




 I really thought for a moment I could pull them off! Guess it's going under shirts, then! 




 By pants, I mean jeans and Dockers Khakis... 














 Was talking to my friend in Miami who has a motorbike and complaining that I really wanted one. She said we should do a motorcycle trip. 

So in 3 days, I rented a motorcycle from Chicago, rode to the Smokies and back alone. I didn't have a jacket and I didn't have glasses (for the first seven hours before i finally gave up and bought a $5 pair at a gas station). She and friends rode from Miami and we met at the Smokies and did "The Tail of the Dragon".

My eyes were red, my skin first chilled to the bone and then burned and chapped. Best trip :D

 




 This is how I read this:

1. Oh nice, a guy got a homeless guy fried chicken.
2. What? The homeless guy was black? He got a black homeless guy fried chicken? So? 
3. Wait? *Reads the status again* He didn't say the homeless guy was black? 
 




 Are you currently a backpacker?

Yes. But never longer than 2-3 days.

 Do you know how to use your equipment well and repair it if needed?

I can use it, but can't repair it.

 Do you know basic first aid, especially for blisters?

Nope :) I guess my preparation has to point in a different way!  

Great advice on the rucksacks walks. I've done lots of hikes with heavy weights, but never trained. This is a good time to start, then.

 




 My goal is to stay healthy, and fit enough to do the Appalachian Trail in 4 months two years from now. However, I have very little knowledge of the Science of fitness and my regime is based only on personal experience of the following:

1. Playing sports all my life (Soccer mainly). I was a competitive swimmer as a kid and a member of my collegiate athletics team in India (long distance)
2. Yoga. My mother is a yoga teacher and I learnt the basics (only) from her.

This is my new fitness regime. Please criticize freely! I alternate days because I was told I should not do the same exercises on consecutive days.

** Days 1,3,5 : **
 
1/ Run 4-6 miles (It's been 6 years since I've run, so I run at the slow pace of about 8:30 per mile)

2/ Row 2000 m (in about 10 minutes) 

3/ If I feel like it, I swim a little and pay a visit to the sauna.

4/ Stretch. 

**Days 2,4,6 :** 

1/ Yoga for stretching (about 20 minutes). 

2/ Push ups (I am currently on 60 in sets of 12-15) 

3/ Sit-ups (On 70 in sets of 12-16).

Then I repeat. I use runkeeper and android apps for the pushups/situps. That's about it. Like I posted before, I have never really used gym or machines before, so any suggestions, help will be greatly appreciated!
 




 That makes perfect sense! I will try squats, deadlifts, etc.. and post again for more feedback.

Thank you! 




 I've grown up doing a variety of athletic activities and exercises, but I never really had access to a gym. 

Now I do, and what I want to know is this: 

What advantage the machines in the gym (and weights) offer over say push-ups, sit-ups and pull-ups, which I regularly do anyway. They do look like fun and I see that a lot of people are really into it, which must mean there's solid reasons for it!

 




 I'm going back now to see this girl you speak of! 




 I just saw the guy. He's pretty boring. 




 I will be dare  
I will be dare   
To be there!
 




 I am a graduate student. I live paycheck to paycheck and I currently owe my friends+brother about $6000. I make $900 or $1700 per month depending on the semester and what course I'm teaching.

Most of that money goes in rent. I have no car and don't eat out to save money, which means I've become one mean cook! 




 Ah...I see your point. So I came up with a clever line where it wasn't relevant...shit. 




 Well, independent story. I was the Instructor for an Engineering course and caught 6 Indians cheating. I am an Indian too and I cheated when I was an undergrad too. 

However, they still got zero credit for their assignments. 

**tl;dr**: Rules are rules when you have to enforce them. When you have to follow them, use your judgement! 




 I really can't believe someone's complaining that their girlfriend wants to have sex.

 I don't know why there's such a backlash against violence. You didn't mean any humiliation with your slap, only retribution. Violence, like everything else is good in moderation.

Her cheek will heal, you'll have your revenge and everyone will laugh at it two weeks from now.
 




 I like ketchup on the side...not in things. 

Ketchup with fries = good
Ketchup on burger = NO
Ketchup on Chicago Hot Dog = NO WAY! All those other things go so well together. I can't imagine why anyone would imagine adding ketchup is a good idea!
 




 This is only for rich people to say. 




 Okay that just made my day, night and week. Have been thinking similar things all of the last few months, but I guess Neil Gaiman just says it better. 




 I'm south Indian. I don't hate north Indians. And the ones I don't hate, don't hate me. 




 There's a bus which goes to Iowa City

Costs $56 round trip...Not sure about amtrak! 




 Just curious. I came to the first world from the third world and while I would laugh at all the silly problems "those guys" would have when I was there, I think they're all very real problems when I'm here!

Well, some of are funny, of course. But most of them seem like real first world problems to me. Is it just the fact that they're not problems in the "third" world that makes them funny? Because when I face the problem (like going to pee when I'm already asleep on a comfortable bed), I don't laugh at the fact that I didn't think this was a problem before, because it is one now! 
























 Suddenly I stop reading  
And my hands,   
They refuse to turn the page  

  
The words in the book  
Become a blur  
My eyes lose focus  
And my mind sees you  

My stomach reminds me  
Of a bird in a hailstorm  

My legs lose all feeling.  
The couch dissolves.  
The room disappears.  

There is only me  
And you inside.  

A halo of pain  
Places itself upon my head.  

And tightens.  

A crown of thorns.  

I do not understand how anyone can find this pleasurable

I laugh nervously to myself  
As my heart fills    
With the emptiness of the night   




 I think your content is good, but you seem to be in the same boat as me. We need to edit much, much more.

I'm having to be frank with you, but you (and I, that's why I'm saying this) aren't "natural" poets -- the kind that write a masterpiece in one sitting. 

We have poetic thoughts, then we put them down. But without refinement, we are just stones on a beach. 




 And capital! 




 That's true :) I've read a lot about his darkroom awesomeness. But I've never learnt photoshop, and I'm trying to get the photos in-camera to a decent level before I try!

If you need someone to talk to, I am only a PM away. 




 Wow :)  




 Not for depressed people :(

Work on it? No.

Stop dwelling on it? No.

No. No. No.

Fuck. The picture makes sense. Why doesn't it work? 

No. No. No.

Maybe I should get off this subreddit. 




 Okay, that's just boolean logic (propositional?). Does not apply to axiomatic systems of proofs at all. I don't know the semantics of logic, really, but I meant the way of thought that we use in mathematical proofs. And transitivity (a = b and b = c  = a = c) is something that is not assumed in logic, but has to be proved.

The theory of vaccines, information technology and all that exist because people were willing to question everything. Which is just what I'm doing. 

 




 Oh I did not know that at all..What are the species of circularity? Is there anything I can read to know more?

The fact that launching a rocket and children throwing balls are similar changes nothing about the fact that we are not questioning the Scientific Method. The thing is, I am sure people have questioned it and have answered much better than me...So I'm just looking for sources, I guess.. 




 Shouldn't have brought God into the mix, sorry. I'm not worried about God at all...I just like thinking about these things.

Of course circularity is useless. When you have a circular proof with no way around it, it means you have an assumption you cannot prove. And that was what I was asking -- whether the Scientific method is such an assumption. It seems it is, for now at least. 

Which is not a bad thing at all. We have to start consistent thought somewhere :) 




 The scientific method is what makes me question the scientific method. That's the beauty of Science (and Philosophy I guess), right? You question everything, including your questioning...till you die! 




 1. Yes of course. And that very method allows to question the method itself. Which is all I'm doing. No God involved :)

2. Occam's razor tells us to choose the one that makes the fewest assumptions as our theory. Nothing about right or wrong since the competing theories already have to be able to explain the observations anyway.  




 Ah, this was exactly the kind of answer I was looking for!

But see ... you're using the method of proof by contradiction to demonstrate that E - mc2 = 0. And that method derives from the axioms of Math, which in turn are derived as hypotheses from the Scientific Method. I would love to see an axiomatic math researcher's (if that's what they're called) comments on this :D

Occam's razor as fundamental law makes sense I guess.

So it's an axiom...which leads to an interesting quandary whether you choose the axiom of Occam's Razor or whether you choose the axiom of God.

While I will always choose Occam's Razor because everything I do rests on it, I can't really tell a religious guy not to do it because half of everything he does rests on the assumption of God :-/ 




 No. God is an extra axiom that you would need in addition to the axioms of Science. 

Basically, God is not a necessary assumption you need to make to explain anything in the observable universe (yet), so God doesn't exist. That's the way I've understood it. 




 Ah...that makes sense...thanks! 




 I've been thinking of this question for a while now, but have been scared to post on here because of all the hostility on here. Though my questions have nothing directly to do with God or religion (only with concepts used in arguments), so I have hope!

Before you pick up your pitchforks, atheism is my description of choice, though I find the absence of God (or his imaginary presence) has very little relevance in my life.

So, I read through the popAtheism of Dawkins and Hitchens. I went reasonably deep into the philosophies of Science etc., so here's some questions I've ended up with (If I'm stupid, tell me, but also tell me why :) ) :

1/ Is there any justification for the Scientific Method? Well, of course it works. But it doesn't really do anything outside of the scientific method. You make a hypothesis, you do experiments, you make predictions, you do experiments, and you smile if it agrees and change the hypothesis if it doesn't.

So that's a good method. But is there any way "outside" of the Scientific method to justify it? Because proving/verifying a theorem/concept using itself is pretty useless.  

So any prediction made using the Scientific method is a validation of the hypothesis, not of the Scientific method itself.

Right? Or do I have something wrong somewhere?

2/ Occam's razor: This for me, was the strongest proof of the non-existence of God. Still pretty strong. Have a question about it:

So, Occam's razor says that given two hypotheses explaining the same set of observations/phenomena, you choose the one that makes fewer assumptions.

My question is: Isn't the Occam's razor itself an assumption?!

Of course, it IS certainly a **reasonable** assumption (far more reasonable than God) with a **valid** (in my mind) probabilistic justification (fewer assumptions means fewer ways of being wrong).

BUT: The justification itself depends on probability, which depends on the choice of mathematical axioms, which depends back on Occam's razor. Circular!

Is there something wrong with my logic? 




 Oh? Really? Wow...

How is it a flaw in security? Does it make your phone less secure? 

If say, they made phones easily rootable, would the phones be less secure? 




 Sorry if this question is stupid: 

I have a Motorola Bravo (very obscure phone) and linux and little patience -- a combination that has led to many attempts, all unsuccessful, at rooting.

Though this has got me wondering: Why do the carriers/manufactures make such a big deal out of rooting?

I understand that it voids your warranty, since you're messing with stuff at a low level.

But apart from that, why does it bother them so much? 

I've already paid for the phone, and am not paying any less by rooting it. I'm still paying the same amount monthly as I did before rooting the phone. 
So what's the difference to them?

It's like saying people can buy a plain t-shirt, but can't paint anything on it :-/

I'm sure there's something wrong in my logic...but can't see what.

EDIT: Well, that's cleared up...Thank you all :) Asking a question in a different time zone means you wake up to answers :D 




 Also, I did not know Sid stood for Siduction :D 




 Did you guys figure it out? The same thing happened to me yesterday.

A new problem is that 'kmix' seems to be crashing every time I login! 




 Indian reporting as requested!

I don't see what caste has to do with slums...People of all religions, castes and creeds live in illegal slums...but since you asked about caste, here I go.

It is important to keep in mind that *different  Indians see very very, different Indias*. So reporting today in this comment is a middlish class Bangalorean (big city) who lives in a nice sheltered area. Like many houses here, we have a lady who comes to do our dishes and to clean the house. 

The caste system is still in vogue, but I would say it's going out of style in the cities. ** For everyone above a certain economic class.** 

The servants (maids, cooks etc) are still all of lower caste (the converse is not at all true). Whether they are discriminated against or not ..... (to be continued) 

(the relationship between houses and the people who serve there are complex and involve many members of both families, exchange of gifts and the such..., it's very common for them to become extended family while still being servants)

(continued)...... it is undeniable that all of them are from the lower castes. 

So I would say (in my India), there isn't direct discrimination, but well...my mother wants me to marry someone from the same caste.

The history of the caste system provides some weak justifications for it, but as the great Ari Gold (Entourage) once said: There are no asterisks, only scoreboards.

Well, this isn't very informative. the **tl;dr** would be: There is no direct discrimination (in middlish class India in a big city), but there are a lot of conservative ideas because of which the caste system still carries import.

On the other hand, there is the issue of reservations in a lot of places for the "lower" castes...but that's a different discussion.
 




 Thanks!

I'll be alright, I guess :) 




 Oh *facepalm*! I had used alsamixer so much back in the day...Had completely forgotten about it! 




 Yup. There was no mic slider...I think veromix was fucking things up.. 




 Oh thanks! Will look at this! 




 I would have agreed with you yesterday morning. But when faced with evidence.....

The problem is with the way kmix/veromix interact with each other, I think...but can't say anything more. 




 I'm on Kubuntu 12.04 beta.

Yesteaday I had to video chat with a friend. I kept my mother's window laptop by my side on account of my experiences a few years ago. 

I installed the google video chat plugin and lo and behold, my webcam was working fine. But...my microphone wasn't!

So I installed unity and logged back into it and everything worked! 

Windows was kicked out the door.

Though I would have liked if it had worked on KDE, because I like KDE. 

Any ideas why it didn't work? I am using veromix with pulseaudio on KDE and the default soundmenu on unity. 




 Magnificent!!! :) 




 That's cool. I wish I was around so you would have an extra shoulder :) 




 Hang in there. I can't help you with much really, but I can tell you this after being through a lot education:

Take the courses you like! Work hard! Learn stuff! IT DOES NOT MATTER if you're unintelligent and you fail. IT DOES NOT MATTER if you're super intelligent and you get an A.

I mean, it does matter for a while, but believe me. I've failed and gotten As on courses and in a few years, all that will matter is that you took the courses you liked and tried to learn. 

Keep learning, keep studying. Keep working. Keep trying. 

You'll cry on some nights. Maybe many nights. Get through them and when you're reasonably okay again, focus on what you want and keep trying to do it.  




 **tl;dr** (Very long post... so putting a tl;dr at the top and the bottom): Was getting energy back in life. Lost it all again. Help needed.

I have to admit, I have not been diagnosed as depressed. I haven't even seen a therapist yet in my life. So I'm sure my problems aren't half as serious as the problems on this subreddit. Maybe I'm just weak. 28, male, single, failure, you know the usual. In any case, I would really appreciate some help.

Much of the last year was spent in a haze or sorrow and anger, mostly over a girl. It's not an uncommon story. I liked her, wasn't confident, didn't tell her (also, she had a boyfriend) and so traveled to the friendzone. (EDIT to add details: Burnt my fingers with cigarettes a few times, punched many trees and walls till my knuckles swelled up and I couldn't write a few times, drank a lot of whisky...nothing extraordinary inasmuch as life goes). Told her eventually and was told I had betrayed her 

(which was true, I don't deny. I should have told her long before...but it was lack of confidence, not an intention of ... oh whatever). 

We became friends again. We're roommates too now, so sometimes (since I see her daily) things still hurt in my heart. You know, the usual.

I am also doing a PhD in what would be considered one of the top 5 universities in my field with one of the top 2 people in my field. I said all that to indicate the irony that I'm going nowhere with it. He doesn't care what I do. If I was self-motivated enough to do something about all this, it would all work out. All I need to do is sit down and work. But I don't. You know, weak...the usual.

The end of last year, I decided I would turn a new leaf and fix my life, one step at a time, however small those steps were. I told some people on this very subreddit about my brilliant idea and got a lot of encouragement, and was even told I helped one or two! I started exercising, and dressing better and walking with my back straight. It was all getting better.

Then my mom got two tumours in her spine. She had one in her brain, and was on the road to recovery (or the equivalent for brain tumours). She had survived (even lived, you could say) two years longer than the 18 months she was promised. And then two completely new guys cropped up in her spine. Now she's completely immobile. I came back home to help and now can't go back to university for useless visa issues. 

Which means I might lose my job. 

The thing is, I was okay with all of this. But today morning, I realized I've lost all energy. Completely drained. I have close friends, but I don't particularly want to talk to any of them about it, becuase I've realized they don't understand. You know, the usual.

So, please help reddit. I have no energy left to start all over again on my smallStepsTheory.

**tl;dr**: Was getting energy back in life. Lost it all again. Help needed.
 




 Ah okay, that makes sense...thanks! I was wondering what was changing in the wings... 




 Loaded in what way? Cargo? Why do the wings differ in height when the cargo is loaded? 




 I maybe stupidly misinformed...but is Prince Philip the queen's husband?

"The queen's husband Prince Philip..."

EDIT Oh nevermind. Someone else asked and was answered below
 




 The kid doesn't understand much because he's young...that's what I think/thought. 




 There was a time when I used to think this was a song by Boyzone and how awesome the lyrics were awesome even though it was by them :D 




 Interesting answer. Thanks!

I'm not asking if the voltage exists in an existential way. I'm asking in the way us atheists say God doesn't exist because nothing He/She/It/Spaghetti does is measurable. 

So for the battery, the voltage has meaning ONLY when the battery is connected, i.e. when the voltage can be measured (or if it can be measured in some other way, that's fine too).  

However, before the battery is connected, the voltage is still Measurable, because I know that connecting the terminals will set up a current etc. 

I was wondering if the above two things are in fact the same, and it is meaningless to talk about the "measurability" of something without actually keeping the possibility of measuring it in mind. 




 So is its existence accepted fact? Or are experiments still being conducted to verify whether it actually exists or not?

EDIT: http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html They (It?) have (has?) been detected and measured...Not sure what you were trying to imply.

EDIT 2 : Okay they are still trying to measure them..sorry :) But doesn't put the spectrum on the same standing of scientific acceptability as the Higgs Boson? Something that's "supposed" to be there, but we can't see yet and will hopefully see when we experiment or else the world will fall apart?

 




 I just replied on a [comment thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/rbhve/how_do_the_heart_rate_sensors_at_a_gym_work/c44l5ra) and that sparked my curiosity about this:

The question is: Is there a distinction in Science between "measurable" and "measured"? Can the potential between two battery terminals, for example, be considered a physical quantity before it's measured?

I guess it's kind of a stupid question....but I' not sure!
 




 This is a tangent onto a philosophyOfScience question... I was under the impression that in Science, nothing exists if it's not measured.

Or maybe "measurable" is different from "measured" ... New thread required? 









 :) Good luck! Don't hesitate to make your step even smaller if this doesn't work! Keep trying to keep moving in the right direction :) 




 Well, it wasn't a waste of time. I got to do a fun analysis :) 




 Oh no :( 




 Never seen that meme used better. The final frame really hit me hard....Completely feel your feelings there! 









 I did my own calculations based on the numbers on his website. 

It's not like I read "I flew!" there and believed it immeditaely. 
 




 Can't argue with that :) 




 Yeah even 2 Hz is enough for him to get the lift he requires. I used 10 Hz more out of excitement than anything else.

He's said he needs 2 KW of power for his weight, which is what the battery he's using provides.

EDIT (because I got some more free time): With 2 Hz, he'll need to run at around 6.5 m/s, which is a pretty easy sprinting speed (with weight attached). Good point though...With such heavy wings, 10 Hz would be crazy! 

EDIT 2: I saw your videos. You have to realize that this guy's ornithopter is not even close to being as impressive as the ones you've posted. This is just some guy hacking together a thing that flies. It hardly does anything new in any way. Which is why I can't understand why people are so surprised by it! 




 It's not human powered, only human controlled. 




 See thread below. It's not necessarily fake. 




 Yes...Fun :) Especially if it concerns aerodynamics 




 Phew! Please tell me you're convinced of the aerodynamic feasibility :)

Again, I can't comment on the photoshoppiness of the thing... 




 You are completely right...Oops! :)

Here really, L/D doesn't matter. As long as he can attain the lift, he'll get into the air. And then fall out very quickly of course, but he will still get up!

However, his wing area is 15 m^2.

Part 2 of calculations...Note that I have no problem with you being right. In fact, the way this currently is: I am assuming you're right and hoping to prove you wrong.

CL = 1.4  
L = 100 kg (Seems he has a 20 kg backpack)  
S = 18 m^2 (From his website)  
rho = 1.225    

V = sqrt(100 * 9.8 * 2 / (1.225 * 18 * 1.4) ) = 7.96 m/s


So, now the question is if 7.96 m/s is possible. It means you run 100 m in 12.5 s. That is unfortunately extremely fast, but not unattainably so. All he needs to get in the air is maintain that speed for 2 s. Then flap hard enough.....not convincing

In any case, I guess the tide is currently in your favour. 

I got some hope based on a WIRED article ([http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/01/humans-with-bird-wings/](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/01/humans-with-bird-wings/)) 

But that article says nothing, really.

So, for now without further information (and even though he flew clumsily and came down pretty quickly), I have to say you must be right, though there is still hope for the man :)


************ BUT WAIT!!! ******************

(Sorry for getting excited. I generally get that way when I get a sudden realization of what I was doing wrong) 
EDIT! : I made a mistake. Flapping CL doesn't depend only on V, it also depends on the flapping speed itself!!! 

Phew. I knew I was making a mistake.

So, let's say he runs at 6 m/s. And flaps at 10 Hz (10 times per second). The average speed (which on the back of an envelope can be assumed to be acting over the whole wing. Of course, the root won't move at all and the tip will move much faster) of up and down motion will be 10 Hz * 5 m (half span)/2 = 25 m/s.  There's my answer...

So the net speed the wing will see will be sqrt(6^2 + 25^2) which is far greater than what is required to get him in the air with a CL of 1.4. In fact, even with a CL of 1, he will still be able to get off the ground.

His low L/D of course, will bring him back down pretty quickly, which is what happened (he couldn't even fly for 10 s).

So I am convinced that his flight is CERTAINLY aerodynamically possible. 

Thanks for your observations...Because of them, I do think these calculations are correct now :)
 




 Ah, that's better.

I don't see why it's impossible. You have a good point there about the lift. Maybe you're right... Let's calculate see what CL is required. 

Lif = mass * gravity = 80 kg * 9.8  
Wing area = 10 m^2 (say 10 m span and 1 m chord)  
rho = 1.225 kg/m^3

Now let's find out what CL you need to have to get a running speed of say 12 mph  -- a speed that shouldn't be hard to attain with significant weight on your back.

So,  

CL = m * g / (0.5 * rho * S * V^2)  
     = 4.45

A CL of 4.45 is not high for a flapping airfoil (This one is in fact a nicely cambered airfoil cross section) since it generates generates lift both through unsteady and steady effects. 

See Fig 2 on page 4 of ([http://web.mst.edu/~isaac/AIAA-2006-0450.pdf:](http://web.mst.edu/~isaac/AIAA-2006-0450.pdf). 

The frequency there is about 2 flaps per second at it gets to a CL of 3 which is in fact certainly lower than for the guy, since he's flapping at a higher frequency. His Reynolds number is also higher than for the paper, which would mean CL is in fact higher than the paper).

So, back of envelope calculations support the dutch guy. 

An L/D of 4 is certainly not high. Gliders have (L/D)max of up to 60. A Boeing 747 has one of 17.  But those are designed for high L/Ds (so is his wing probably, but let's not give him the benefit of doubt just yet). 

A flat plate moving at an angle of attack of 5 degrees (no unsteady effects, so the value I get here will be conservative) has an L/D of approximately 5! (using the formulae in[ http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/kiteincl.html](http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/kiteincl.html))

So L/D of 4 is achievable too. In any case, I'm sure his drag was pretty high, which is why he came down so quickly.

So I guess your apprehensions are answered. I had fun doing the calculations :)

I mean, look at the guy. He flew for maybe 100 m and then came back down. It's not particularly impressive. But it's certainly not impossible.

A different thread on reddit however, talks about inconsistencies in the video (pixels and what not). Now, my specialty is aerodynamics, so I cannot comment on that :D

EDIT: Made a mistake in the calculations (didn't convert from mph to m/s) 




 Right...because that's what believers do when they see something they doubt. They go hunting for answers to their questions. 




 You're not crazy, but it's probably not fake. Some common arguments against it:

1. Human power is not sufficient for this: The aircraft if NOT human powered. A wii controller picks up his motions , passes through an Android phone which does the processing to give similar motion to the wings. 

2. Flat wings can't generate lift/Up-down wing motion can't generate lift: The motion is not up-down. The wing is not flat. The cross section is an airfoil designed and the wing is designed with spars and ribs just like any model aircraft.

It required some digging and reliance on Google translate on the man's dutch website to get the above information.

So, you're not crazy, but it's not fake. It's also not that impressive. The thing basically is just an ornithopter that is getting it's control input from a human.  




 Shankar Tucker not equal to John McLaughlin. He plays songs from movies and in general, I like the original more.

In any case, that's just my opinion. Indian Classical Fusion FTW! 




 The next morning. In fact, it's worse today, which is the next-to-next morning after the swelling. 




 I had been waiting a long time for someone to teach me to use the weights and bars in the gym. I have always been more of a running+stretching kind of guy.

So two days ago, I met a friend with whom I worked out for an hour. We did squats, bench presses and bicep/tricep stuff with dumbbells. 

Today, my left shoulder (the place where the shoulder becomes the arm) is hurting quite badly. While I attribute this of course, to bad form, I am not sure which of those exercises caused this...Any help would be appreciated, thank you1 




 I'm like you, except I'm 28 and I'm starting to walk with my back straight now! Go for it, keep taking these steps and eventually maybe hopefully possibly, you'll wake up more than 2 days out of 7 happy. If you do, consider all the effort worth it :) 




 If you run today and still do 11:30 for 2.4 km, I don't think you have any reason to worry.

I was doing 3 miles in 25 minutes, and now (three months later), I do 5 in 35, and this was without any training program or even a goal, whatsoever.

I'm sure that with a structured program, you will do great. For your distances, I would recommend reading training programs for reducing times for 2000 m and 1000 m races. Programs with slow days, distance days and fast days seem to work best.

Good luck! 




 I have done this and it works pretty well. The only two glitches for me:

1. Calls do not connect sometimes. But this happens very very rarely. And when it does, redialing again gets the call to go through.

2. Texts aren't received/sent randomly. This happens often enough to cause me pain. Especially bad is when I'm texting and the phone is switching from Wifi to 3G or the other way.

3. No texting without 3G.

I'm on AT T by the way... 









 I'm sick today and my neck is sprained like never before. It's hurting so much I can hardly move. 

Feels good not to think about other things :)

EDIT: "Feels good", not "Feels not good"...Shit...I can't even get a post right! 




 There's a ppa available too (and has been for some time now):

 Oh shit...I commented on the wrong thread! I was about to tell you that the OP is talking about the Transformer Prime and telling him about a 7" tablet may not be useful.

Oops. I should downvote myself for this! 




 7 inches though 




 Where is this place? 




 Wow, I am glad to have helped :) The table part is a true story!

I am male and 27... Can't afford (monetarily at least) to think about therapy or medication yet as a graduate student, but basically wasted away most of the last 1.5 years in a haze. 

It's still not easy though. On bad weather days (as [Stephen Fry](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2009/10/it-will-be-sunny-one-day.html) calls them), it's not easy at all for me to believe that this system will work. But I try to believe him and wait for it to pass. 
 




 I was/am in the same boat as you. 

But I have realized that things can get slightly better if you start accepting "slightly better" as an option.

And "slightly" is really really slightly. I thought I would clean my room, I didn't. I thought: Fuck the room, let me clean my table. I didn't. Eventually I settled for buying $3 bin from Walmart and dumping stuff from the table into it. So the table looks clean now.

Tomorrow, I will make my bed. The table will get dirty again. I'll put it in the bin again.

I guess what I'm trying to say is don't try to force yourself to take a step if you don't feel like it. Keep reducing the size of the step till you can actually take it. 

This is getting long and maybe irrelevant, but a friend and I were discussing motivation today: We realized we have come to be depressed because we expected the sky from our lives and were not motivated enough to actually do anything to get there. While we have had this discussion many times before, today was particularly enlightening since we also realized that while not doing anything to reach the sky, we had actually dug a deep hole for ourselves into the ground and jumped in.

So now, we have to first put in effort to reach the ground. Before that, we have to accept that we are at the bottom of a pit. Then, we climb one step out. Which for me meant exercise half an hour every two days. When I couldn't do that, I exercised 15 minutes every two days. Now I'm upto half an hour every day. Eventually, I'll be happy. That's the hope.  




 I am in the friendzone and I have to say, the discussion here is far more helpful and informing than the one on r/funny. 

Though I guess [/r/funny](/r/funny) isn't meant for help anyway. So power to both! 




 Leaving for work. I put on my shoes and my jacket fifteen minutes ago. 

Now Imma sweatin'   
and  Imma redditin' 




 What?! Art majors don't lead a fulfilling life?

As an engineer, I've been blaming my choice of major for my lack of fulfillment all along, telling myself that if I'd taken up writing like I wanted to, I would have been happy now. 




 No. There is a lot to see...it was different actually being here, of course!

Though I completely agree with you about getting out of the inhabited areas...National Parks FTW!! 




 Hmm...I'm indian, and this is an actual conversation I had:

White Woman: So in India, do you really go to school on elephants?  
Me (laughing making it obvious I was joking): No. We have camels for that.  
WW (laughs too): So what did you think of the US when you first came here?  
Me: It was just like the movies!   
WW: Which movie?  
Me: Terminator.

Unknown to her, I wasn't joking! Apart from the action, the country looked exactly like in the movies and people seemed to act exactly like in the movies. 

Hmm...This is kind of irrelevant to the question, I just realized. But...since I've typed it all....

 




 I think I have said somewhere else on this reddit before that there are two schools of Yoga. Well, there are many, but there are two major schools that come to mind on reading the article:

1. The "modern" school - They believe that the final pose is what matters in Yoga. Props like ropes, stools and weights are used to get people to the final pose. This is why it is so painful. This is also why it is good for some people who are already physically ready for it.
2. The "classical" school based on Patanjali's teachings - [Patanjali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pata%C3%B1jali) is a guy who lived long ago and happened to organize all the teachings of Yoga upto the point into "Sutras". His idea was that the main purpose of Yoga is to lead up to ultimate peace of mind and oneness with the body (and well..the spirit - whatever that is). The asanas are just routes to this. With this second route, most of what the article says falls flat and this is what I have been taught, though I am sure the first method has its own advantages.

One that is completely absent in Western teaching: The guru/teacher has to teach each student individually based on his/her physical and mental abilities and the student in turn places complete trust in the teacher.  




 I can recommend a book for sure: "The Anatomy of Yoga" by David Coulter. 




 That is what it translates to exactly. Sava is corpse, Asana is pose (or exercise). Don't know why you would consider it silly :-/ 




 I went to a cemetery once when I was depressed and just sat there. It was about a girl, so it was easy to be depressed.

Eventually, I felt randomly peaceful and went to an interview that I had scheduled. The interview went well and I went back into the depressed state for a while.

Got off-track there. tl;dr: Went to cemetery and spoke, but to myself. 




 I took up writing and exercise. Sad and lonely makes for good poems that you hate when you write them, but look better later (much later, as in months or years) when you look back and maybe edit them.

Exercise is well...exercise. It's what I do to make the rest of the day slightly brighter. 

I think what makes you think video games are wasted time is that you have nothing to show for it after the act. But you can look at it one of two ways: It doesn't matter, or if it matters, do something that lets you create or that leaves something with your mind after it's over. 

Like poetry or art or music or woodwork or photography or rock climbing or hiking. Those are random examples, of course. 

Though none of this will make you better immediately. That (I believe) is a gradual transformation. Doing things will get you stage where you can look at yourself without the self-deprecation that is so normal for people like us. Then, you can start working on being better. At least, that is what I believe and I working towards. I hope you can come along with me on this journey.

Feel free to PM me to talk or anything! 




 Nope. The respective combinations are...For me at least... 




 What's a cervesa? 




 Wow...I can totally see why you call this a wuss story, because that's what I call my life too. But I've realized that we are way more critical of ourselves than the world. We give others far more credit than we do ourselves.

Remember this: You have a girlfriend (I'm assuming you have a happy relationship) and you're healthy, which means you can do whatever you want with your life. I don't know the logistics of what you're trying, but maybe you can transfer to Science/Math in college? EDIT: And you're honest with yourself. Which is more than most of the world can say for itself. With this honesty and your apparent will to follow your dreams, I am sure you will do great at whatever you finally settle into.

I know exactly what you're going through because I went through very similar things and still struggle with these issues. The issues don't go away, unfortunately. But you do get better at dealing with them. 




 Your post is inspiring! Thanks!! 




 I don't have any good things left and I lost all meaning in my life recently.

I'm trying to get back at life by exercising daily, trying to eat well and sleep well. I am completely alone and I sometimes wonder why the fuck I'm trying anything when all I am is a tree that's falling in the forest with no one to see or hear it.

But just keep at stuff. Keep at something. Keep at anything. Forget about trying to get your chin up. Be sad and still keep doing things. Your chin coming up (sorry I'm using that idiom so carelessly) should be a side effect of what you are and what you do. 




 I asked exactly the same question a few days back in a thread :)

http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/nxkra/new_to_rfitness_welcome_and_discuss_your_getting/c3csj9o?context=3 




 I just want to say that I've always dreamed of riding horses and I have no idea why you think it's stupid. 

Take it a day at a time. Follow Stephen Fry's advice posted on here a few days back (http://www.lettersofnote.com/2009/10/it-will-be-sunny-one-day.html). 

I can only say that every day, try to worry about one thing. It would do you good to realize (only on sunny days of course, try your best not to make decisions on the stormy ones) that while your problems are way too much to be solved together, if you work on one (*and only one*), the others knots will begin (only begin, but it's something) to untangle.

Sorry for the vague advice, but PM me if you want and I can tell you how I'm dealing with my shit. 




 Ah. I was about to edit my comment to ask :) Well, I will be going to the smoky mountains sometime in the Spring from Illinois, so I'll make sure I ask on reddit before leaving! 




 I'll tell you what I went through, and maybe that will help (I'm a PhD student, so I can attest for sure that the graph as you currently have it is accurate):

1. High school -- All cool
2. College -- It goes wildly downhill and then wildly uphill and then wildly downhill
3. Grad School Part I (the MS) -- Similar to college, except it's not as wild.
4. Grad School Part II (the PhD) -- For me, it just kept going downhill and downhill till i was a broken wreck. I was a robot walking around. I couldn't work, and I couldn't rest. I was staring at the screen and it seemed like I was a worm eating myself up from the inside. 

I used to tell people that I had used up all my willpower to get out of bed and get to my office, so I had none left to actually do any work. 

Now it's slightly better. Somedays I'm a worm and somedays I work. 

The days that I get work done give my life meaning and the days that I'm a worm give the work value. 




 India, where we have many other things :D 

Somehow, when I was in college in India, we either went out to drink or we went out to eat. We never really had the concept of drinking and eating at the same time at a restaurant, except for Biryani and Kingfisher beer :D 




 Hope I/someone can help you out there and I really hope you get through this well :) 




 Nope. Will certainly keep a look out for it and try, though...Thanks! 




 Well, beer. As a grad student, I don't get to drink the Buds and the Millers, though I can say with confidence that they're quite bad. 

I'm not really good at choosing good beer, but I can say for sure that I like Corona, Dos Equis, Delirium, and IPAs 




 [/r/depression](/r/depression) Lots of people going through similar/wildlyDifferentButKnowExactlyWhatYouMean there 




 Been here a while now, and these are my favourite things that I had not eaten before getting here;

1. Burger, beer and fries -- Ah, the combination!
2. String cheese
3. Pizza and coke
4. (Honorary mention) Blueberry milkshake
5. (Honorary mention) Hashbrowns, Omelette and toasted bread 




 Rice Lentils with spices and stir fried vegetables with other spices and super spicy pickled vegetables followed by rice with  yogurt! Oh sometimes with chips or fried indian "papads"

Makes me happy thinking about it as I eat pasta with butter and parmesan with white wine and green beans on the side

(I love cooking and eating)
