 Yeah I was about to say, there's no way you've gotten to college yet. 




 Ah, I was indeed loosely misinterpreting the thread. 




 Um, what were you thinking? Every username I typed in was already taken so my friend said "Just stop, man" So...what exactly were you thinking? 




 Really? Can't that fuck up your teeth? 




 Where is 'snog' used as a word for that? Unless it means something else and I'm wildly misinterpreting this whole thread. 




 Wait...

 My wife knows none of this.

 Not only is this a repost, but its already been reposed in this post's comments twice. Repostception. 




 How much? 




 Blind people of Reddit, how the fuck are you on Reddit? 




 THAT WAS YOU??? 




 Dear lord, should have made a throwaway... 




 No...but...haven't you seen South Park? 




 Good god man, get a hold of yourself! 




 What exactly do you use this account for?

Hence the 'Dallas Diddler'? 




 That seems...excessive. 









 Lets make a thread. I'll start with '1' and the next person choses 2 and 3 and so on. We're coming for you, daddydean...

 Any reason for the chair in the locker? Nice jersey too, but in my mind the chair mystery is really stealing the show right now. 




 Either [Save Tonight] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nntd2fgMUYw) or [Away and Anywhere] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXBjn2s8ofQ). Its weird, they both calm me down and get me pumped up at the same time. No idea how to explain it.

 No, probably not. 




 There was a joke in 'The Interview' that says somthing along the lines of "Don't shake his hands, hes a Jew" I saw the joke coming and realized that the three other people me and my friend were watching it with were very Jewish. Not just a little Jewish. Anyways the joke comes along and my friend lets lose the loudest laugh of the entire movie. He claims it wouldn't have been awkward if anyone else laughed, but no one did. It was awkward as fuck. 




 I just saw you answered today, but reading this shit really isn't worth my time. To be honest I can't believe your still going down swinging about all this, you were wrong a long time ago. Are you incredibly stubborn, or do you really have nothing better to do than keep arguing online in this sad lonely life of yours? Probably both I suppose. Anyhow, its getting too tiring correcting you countless mistakes and inaccuracies, so log off and go away. You gave it a good shot, but you lost. By a lot. By the way, the log off button is on the upper right side of the screen. I know how fragile your mind is and wouldn't want you to have a brain aneurysm trying to find it.

 Not an 'official' word? Sorry Dr. Seuss, but there's no such thing as an 'official' word, there are words and there are letters put together in groups. You yourself provided an excellent example of this, 'commenter' I believe you called it. I suppose though, if you really want to use your 'unofficial' language, I can direct you to what I like to call ['The Dictionary of High School Dropouts'] (http://www.waywordradio.org/Official_Dictionary_of_Unofficial_English-Grant-Barrett-0071458042.pdf), even in there though I don't think you'll find 'commenter'.

Also, it's a good barometer to see when someone is losing an argument when they stoop to nitpicking word usage.

A barometer is a meteorology device, not an standard by which to measure debates. See what I did there? Probably not. Anyhow do you know what nitpick means? It means to be excessively concerned with or critical of inconsequential details. So are you saying that your looking up the definition of your fake word wasn't nitpicking? Are you saying the defining an already meaningless word and proving its nonexistence wasn't nitpicking? Because either you just used the word nitpicking wildly incorrectly, or you yourself nitpicked, which-by your own admission-is the sign of someone (in this case you) losing an argument. So which is it? Are you wrong *again* or are you losing the argument? Now that I think about it, I suppose it could easily be both.

As for irony, I said it because you have repeatedly said I lack intelligence, when it is clear to even the untrained eye that it is in fact you who is the real unintelligent fool.

The only thing I can say about this sentence is that it is the most grammatically fucked up thing I've seen in a long while.

It was getting embarrassing, I'm glad you saw that. I still can't believe you thought a defensive player was one of the Patriots top recivers! Truly pathetic. The good news is, you've admitted you embarrassing blunder and can move forward with a new lesson learned.

If you really want to pick back up your retarded football talk I'm more than willing, you just seemed to be falling behind. A debate is no fun when I need to keep going back to explain things to you. In fact, I didn't even read your last comment on football. I can only assume it was filled with factual and grammatical errors and inaccuracies. Not that I expected any more from you. Tell me, do people always have to dumb it down for you, or only when your talking about football and other subjects you've barely even heard of? Grammar for example. 




 So my comment is gone, not sure why, maybe it was deleted. I needed to used some truly harsh language to capture your personality and intelligence quotient, I can't help but think the mods didn't appreciate that. Or maybe they could see you were losing you battle by a landslide and decided to put you out of your misery. Either way, here's no way in hell your worth typing that out a second time (or even a first time for that matter, I guess I was just feeling nice :), your welcome). So I guess your just not getting an answer unless the mods give it back. Sorry to disappoint, I know how much you love getting proven wrong. Why else would you say such stupid things?? A tout a l'heure.

EDIT: Nah, I need to put you out of your misery myself. Its the least I can do for such an unfortunate child such as yourself-tell me, how was it to grow up without an education? I'll respond later, but I'm sure you won't like it. If you're asking for it though, fine by me. 









 Your the best! 




 Amendola was brought in to replace Welker, who had 1000 yard seasons with over 100 catches. Amendola wasn't even close to those numbers.

If you think that Bill Belichick tried to replace Wes Welker with Danny Amendola your a bigger idiot than I thought. He brought in a new receiver, period. Why wouldn't you call Donald Jones Wes Welker's replacement? Or Aaron Dobson? Or Josh Boyce? Or Michael Jenkins? Or Jake Ballard? Because they all came in when Welker left, so why is the burden supposed to lie on Danny Amendola? That's some retarded logic your're trying to argue with. Just because they came in at the same time, they must be trading off rolls? If anything, Juilian Edleman is Wes Welkers 'replacement'. Not sure why you thought Amendola was.

He has 3 good games in 2 years. I think your definition of great is a little off.

If you think he's only had three good games in two years, well your already a bigger idiot than I thought. Your a bigger idiot than the bigger idiot I thought you were before? Eh, its redundant, I'm sure you and your general lack of intelligence will prove me wrong again. As for Amendola, he hasen't played much more than three games. Obviously not three whole games, that's not the way Bill Belichick plays his players. He takes them for a reason, for example Blount's power running on third downs or Gonkowski's inside routs in the red zone. He plays them for specific plays, not all of them. The way you keep talking seems like you think every player plays every snap. If you ran an NFL team, dear god they'd be in trouble. This isn't something I should have to explain to you, literally team does this, it's a very easily comprehended part of football. Try to keep up.

That is one of the worst comparisons I have ever seen. I appreciate the try, but goddamn dude, you need to learn how to make an argument.

See, this is why your worse at making an argument than I am. You don't respond to what I said, you respond to the way I said it. Who gives a shit how I said it? My underlying thesis doesn't change, but unfortunately you missed that because you didn't like 'my comparison'. Was my point weather or not a comparison was good? No. Then why do you feel the need to waste time going off on a pointless tangent? Maybe it's because you don't have an answer, so you're changing the subject. Hope not, that would just be depressing. I hope your keeping notes, it might be good for you to know how to carry on a debate some day.

Nope, not even close. It was a counterpoint to you? saying that Brady makes all his receivers great. Rookies or not, they under performed.

Since when is 466 yards and 4 touchdowns in your first season in the NFL 'under-preforming'? And Dobson did even better, 519 yards and 4 touchdowns. Obviously its not something you'd want to see out of a third or fourth year player, but first?? That's not under-preforming, hell he could have been sitting on the bench as a back up and he wouldn't have been under-preforming as a rookie. Get your head out of your ass, these are some very solid rookie years. Go ahead, disagree with that. I didn't think your stupidity was expanding but you've surprised me before.

Are you seriously basing your entire argument that Tom Brady can make anyone look like a star, on one comment from Christain Fauria?

Ha! You made me actually laugh out loud, that's rich! Every time you say something it seems I think 'Wow, I didn't think he could prove himself any more of an idiot, but I'll be damned, I was wrong'. Of course I'm not basing an argument off of Christain fucking Fauria-do you even know who that is?? I did however use his quote as a source to support my argument. Debate 101, maybe you should take it. Jesus Christ this is exhausting trying to get through to people like you. Going back and explaining every sentence is like talking to a six year-old. Literally.


By the way, mentioning Matthew Slater was a test to see if you have any idea what your talking about. Clearly you don't. Slater plays DEFENCE. Didn't catch that.

Did I need to?

YES, YOU SHOULD FUCKING KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OFFENCE AND DEFENSE. How can you even try to carry on a debate about football when you don't know the two?? Its not a mind game at all, but rather a very simple and transparent test to see of you have any idea what your taking about or not. Turns out, your full of shit. I still can't believe that you argued against me by saying a defensive player has bad reviving yards. That's more than pathetic.

You think you are some witty commenter with all the right comments, but you haven't even come close to anything right this entire time.

Nice. No seriously good one, give yourself a pat on the back for that zinger. And it would even make sense too if 'commenter' was a word and if it was the least bit true. *You're* the one I have to keep correcting, and you don't even seem to understand half the shit your saying. It's come to the point where I've considered leaving you to your blissful yet idiotic ignorance, but I'm a charitable person, I keep returning to educate you. Push you luck though and your going to end up one very moronic 'football expert'. Even saying that sarcastically insults the real moronic football experts of the world, your much worse than that. You were right about one thing though, Matthew Slater is not a very good receiver. 




 Okay so I guess you officially give up on what this entire debate was about in the first place, I'll put one in the win column and move on to what ever asinine point you want to debate next.

Your whole argument is flawed, because its based on the point that I'm somehow defending the Patriots in this whole ball-deflation thing. I'm not. At all.

What I am defending however this the just system of due process. So until there is an official statement from the NFL announcing 'the Patriots cheated' no, I do not call that cheating. Why you ask? First of all the sources that supply this information are rarely sound. The guy that announced this whole deflation issue in the first place said that the Patriots used illegal balls and equipment. Clearly this was a very distorted image of the truth, and if is these people were relying upon, we can't take anything they say for anywhere close to certian.

Second, well...do you even know how game process works with regards to the game balls? They are delivered to the stadium where they are opened by a sealed container *by the referees* where they are marked *by the referees* to prevent someone from replacing them. Then they are filled with air *by the referees* and measured *by the referees* who's responsibility it is to take care of them until game time. The only time the footballs are under the control of one of the teams is on the field during the game. You might say 'Well ha! Got you! The Patriots probably deflated the balls just before or during the game!' but you'd be wrong. Inflating and deflating the game balls requires equipment that is simply not available on the field. Anyone seen taking 12 footballs to a machine pushed off to the side would clearly be seen, if not in person than on video. The only other way to deflate them would be to take a knife to the footballs. Probably not what happened. My point is that there is almost no chance for the teams to get a hold of the balls to somehow alter them before the game. There is a very good chance that there was an error made by someone employed by the NFL (probably a referee) that brought the footballs down two pressurized pounds.

My point was never that messing with the game balls wasn't cheating, my point was that there is a lot left unsaid and that even if the Patriots were found to be 100% guilty, it would still be a non-issue. 




 LaFell was already a good receiver? Does that make Danny Amendola a good receiver? Because last year when LaFell was 'already good' he got 627 yards. Danny Amendola, who 'isn't even doing decent' got 633 yards last year. So which is it? Was he 'already good' or was Amendola not only on par with him but arguably better? Get your facts straight and stop contradicting yourself, it's exhausting cleaning up someone your messes.

And Danny Amendola hasn't under preformed at all, in fact when he's on the field he's been doing great. Unfortunately for him though, he's gone almost completely unused. How can you say he's under-preforming when he doesn't play? That's like saying jimmy Garoppolo (Brady's backup) sucks because he only got 100 yards. The person expecting him to get more yards is the idiot in this scenario, not the other way around.

As far as the rookies go, care to name them just to be sure were all on the same page? I think we are for the most part but I wouldn't want us to be addressing completely separate people. Who says their best isn't minimal numbers though? Is your point that rookies can't suck? Just because they're drafted doesn't mean they're good by any means. Unless they're a first or early second round pick, it only means that they could potentially have potential, there is no where close to a guarantee that they are good.

But hey! Guess what! You got something right! Michael Hoomanawanui (for future reference, that's how you spell it) doesn't have good numbers. You know why I chose him? I chose him very deliberately. I chose him because my point was that Brady can turn anyone into a star. Christian Fauria said, and I quote, "These people don't know his name yet, but Tom Brady's making him look like a star out there tonight". My point was never that Hoomanawanui had thousand yard seasons, to be honest I don't even know where you got that from. Keep your eye on the ball 'corby'.

By the way, mentioning Matthew Slater was a test to see if you have any idea what your talking about. Clearly you don't. Slater plays *DEFENCE*. Didn't catch that? He has one recorded reception *EVER*. And you think I'm the one that failed, ha! You have the entire internet at your disposal, but even that wasn't enough to get your head out of your ass. But hey, nice job 'shutting me down'. Don't worry corby, you'll get em' next time.



EDIT: Sorry, I couldn't bear giving you that false hope at the end. Sorry corby, but you actually probably won't get em' next time. Maybe if you lose the suborn ignorance and your debate is against an idiotic five year-old you'll win one, but even then I'm not 100% sure. 




 I'll take your slight redirction as a full surrender. As I was saying, non-issue. But if you don't have any response to what I said before, I understand. Now you can either admit defeat, come up with a reasonable counterpoint (good luck) or try to desperately change the subject. *Again*. 




 Can you make this but with Revis in black and white? That would look dramatic as fuck, please! 




 You can creep on me if you want. Curious of what my internet preception is. 




 You meaning me? No, I didn't break any rules. Not sure why your addressing me personally.

If you mean 'the Patriots didn't break the rules' no, that's not what I'm saying at all-did you even read what I said? What I'm saying is that the entire ball deflation thing is a non-issue. Clearly regardless of what happened didn't change the outcome of the game, hell they could have been playing with Nerf footballs and it wouldn't have changed the outcome of the game, but there are many more 'issues' in the NFL that are getting ten times less attention just because the teams involved aren't headline attention grabbers.

In summary, there are many issues and non-issues in the NFL, this falls under the non-issue category. 




 Really? Again? Matthew Slater, Brandon LaFell and Michael Hoomanawanui to name a few.

To be honest I can't tell if your making my point about Danny Amendola or not. My point is Ameldola has been doing decent considering how much time hes spent actually on the field, but all in all he's not a very good receiver (which anyone who knows anything about Danny Amendola is aware of), and that Tom Brady doesn't have much to work with with regards to a receiving core...which you confirmed for me as if you were some how proving me wrong by supporting my point... Whatever.

And my point about the rookies is we can't tell if they're better under Tom Brady or not because we haven't seen them under any other circumstances. How the hell would we know if Tom Brady brings out their best if we haven't seen them with any other quarterbacks? For all we know, that *is* their best.

Do *you* know what your talking about? Because it certainly doesn't seem like it when I have to spell everything out for you. 




 Okay, you want to talk about really cheating? 'Flat out cheating'? Blow-deflated-footballs-out-of-the-water cheating?

http://phins.com/chris/column_050908.html

Is that not enough? I'll dig out more if you have another 'counter point' but the fact is that people simply don't care if the teams involved aren't winning. Period. If not, explain to me why the Patriots were the only team that got any attention for taping other teams when others were caught doing the same exact things and then some? And why are people still talking about it despite more recent scandals with even more definitive proof involving other teams? Because they aren't winning, so it must not be news. 




 Amendola is doing decent, and the two rookies are rookies. My point is he brings out the absolute best potential in his players and has the ability to make even a bad receiver look like a star. I'm not saying they're all bad receivers by any means, but he makes them look a hell of a lot better. 




 Wow, last year but same people! I would love to have that job every season... 




 The Jets got caught recording opponent's signals a year before SpyGate, did anyone care? No. The Raiders were known for over inflating footballs beyond their legal limit (as are the Packers apparently), does anyone care now? Nope. The Lions ran multiple deceptive plays where they threw to a lineman as an eligible receiver *this year*, did anyone bat an eye?? No one.

Apparently there are many "non-issues" going on, just involving poor franchises. They've all been caught but did you hear about it? Nope. Did you hear about it before there was even an ounce of proof that the Patriots did it? Absolutely.

If the NFL is willing to catch and release like that its clearly a non-issue. Just because a big team supposedly does what the little teams are doing shouldn't make it any more or less of an issue. They've all been caught, but no one cares until a winning team might be involved. If it's an issue, than the little teams should be addressed just as harshly by the NFL and the media as the big teams. If not, then it's simply a not an issue. 




 I don't know, I really like [NFL on CBS] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idNhIdw2Bpo).

EDIT #2: How did I forget [March Madness] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhC5-uIJJWQ)?!! 




 Even though Tom Brady didn't have the records the past few years, I still think hes the best. I mean most great quarterbacks have an arsenal of receivers to chose from to make their stat sheet look good, not Brady. Who does he have this year? The list starts and ends with Rob Gronkowski. Everyone else is decent to average. Despite this, Tom Brady makes them look good. Brandon LaFell? Matthew Slater? Even Julian Edelman? These guys aren't stars by any means, but under Tom Brady everyone is turned into a dangerous weapon. Even when he doesn't have a team, Tom Brady takes them to the playoffs every year. Literally, every. Singe. Year. That's why hes the best. Well, one of the reasons. 




 Thats a big *IF*. Where do these allegations come from anyways? Did a Colts fan decide Sunday night "45-7? Must be trickery! Get Roger on the phone!" The media's reception of sports scandals always reminds me of the Salem witch trials. Someone is accused of something and then with out a trial or so much as proof suddenly they're guilty. Maybe I should accuse Russel Wilson of greasing Barndon Bostick's gloves (hes the guy who dropped that onside kick), just to even the playing field. 




 You still want New England?? 47-7... If I were you I would want a win, not a risk.

 Even with the tags, I don't think you should post stuff like this unless you specify how gigantic a spoiler it is in the title or until it at least happens in the show.

 For some reason the contractor that designed my house put the door bell in the bathroom. I've had many an electrician try to fix it, but apparently the single wire going from my front door to the bathroom is absolutely vital to the structural integrity of the entire house. I wouldn't mind the door bell, its usually not that bad when your not in the bathroom. When you are though...you know how you jump out of your seat when theres a BANG! in a scary movie? Similar concept, very different end result. Its come to the point where Im scared to shit in my own home. This house has taken the most basic of human rights from me...

Ive been collecting it for a few years now, very proud of what I have so far. I have a few more Im working on finishing that are missing a few autographs. Anyone know Kirk Hammett? Ive been trying to track him down since 2008...

 Singers make songs all the time that claim they've done drugs, stolen, assaulted, etc. yet no one ever gets arrested for that. And in Anthony Keidis' (Red Hot Chili Peppers singer) autobiography he talks about a life full of illagal drug and substance abuse, yet he's probably never even been questioned by the police (well...). Hell theres videos on Youtube of Wiz Khalifa smoking weed! I'm pretty sure though that if I was caught with a recording or self-written note admiting to any type of crime that I would be arrested on the spot, so why aren't they?

EDIT: I don't necessarily want to see any of these people prosecuted, I'm just curious why they arn't.

 It almost sounds like you're talking about the [Immigrant Song] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66ChMPV0LTg)... 









 I read that line over *way* too many times. I figured this was published on a fairly respected tech blog, so it must be me who's doing something wrong. 




 This is going to get burried, but to me its by *far* [Quixoticelixer] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bCQeE2L3ISI) by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The best b-side EVER. Seriously, good can an album be to shave off a song like this? 




 I wrote both of them well after. 




  nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I hadn't planned on writing a follow up to [this] (http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2w8arl/the_window_washer/), but a few people asked what happened to me next. So here it is.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I read the message again. And again. And again I didnt want to believe what it said. Maybe I had misread it? Or misunderstood it? No, no it was much too simple to be misconstrued. He was coming after me.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I forced myself to snap out of it and ran over to the lifts console. I quickly pushed the lever up and waited as the lift lazily crawled upwards. I would have gone down if I could, but these kinds of machines only go down to the 14th floor. Going up was the only option.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I couldnt help but to cringe at the leisurely speed of the lift. One Chase Plaza is only 60 stories tall, but I still had a dozen to go. I found myself nervously glancing at the railing on the roof to see if he had made it. So far so good. 49th floor...50th floor Ten left.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I tried to get the attention of anyone working in the building, but most had already left by now. I got the attention of a janitor, but he just smiled and waved to me, oblivious to my peril. I didnt give up. Every floor I passed I pounded on the glass and yelled at the top of my lungs.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;51...52...

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I glanced back up and froze. There he was. Looking over the railing smiling down at me. I reached towards the console to stop the lift but he laughed and shook his knife like a finger saying no. Then he ran over to the turbine collecting the wire that was hauling up the lift. To my horror, he started hacking and stabbing at, breaking the wires one thread at a time. He started panting between his hysterical laughs. *This man is a monster!*

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; I had never been more scared of anyone in my entire life. Every few hacks would send a jolt through the entire lift, it started to tilt like a ship taking on water. I moved to the raised end completely helpless. I needed to get to the roof to get off of the failing lift, but doing that forced me closer toto him. I looked down in terror at the streets below. Should I jump? Should I end things on my own terms? I shuddered, and reached for the console.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He must have seen me because he let out a scream like no noise I had ever heard before. Nooooooo! he hissed.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I looked up just in time to see him lose patience with the wires. He reached for the railing and launched himself over, hurling knife first at me. I yelled and dove towards the lowest part of the lift. He missed, but just barely. The entire structure shuddered under the impact. Before I knew it he was back on his feet and charging at me. I backed up until I could feel the cold metal railing behind me, I had no where to go. Like the woman had been in her office, I was trapped.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;In a final act of desperation I jumped into the air and slammed myself down as hard as I could onto the failing lift. The cables buckled under the pressure and nearly snapped. It sent a shockwave through the lift and sent us both off our feet. I expected it though and grabbed on. He didnt. His feet went out from under him and sent him down onto his face. The knife flew out of his hands and skidded towards me.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;There was no time to think. I grabbed the knife and ran over the man. 59...60. Yes! I jumped over the roofs railing and turned to face the man, knife in hand. For the first time he wasnt smiling at me, the expression on his face was one of shock. Then it turned to anger. He began to scramble to his feet screaming. I ran to the wire coil and looked back at him. ILL KILL YOU! he screamed. That was all the motivation I needed. I swung the knife as hard as I could at the weakened wire.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;For a second I thought I hadn't cut through it, but then I heard a series of loud popping noises and a section of the lift lurched downwards. The cable snapped and the other chords began to pop one by one. Every time the lift dropped a few more feet he laughed harder and harder until the weight was too much to bear. The remaining cables snapped and the lift fell into the open air. He laughed hysterically the whole way down...

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I was stunned. I almost couldnt move, the knife fell from my hands and followed the man to the ground. I didn't wait around for it to hit the sidewalk though, I couldnt bear to watch. I got myself together and walked back to the elevator. I got some looks for my torn up and battered uniform, but I didnt care. On my way out I asked a concierge to call the police, which she did without hesitation after she got a look at me.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I stepped out the front door and saw the lift immediately to my left. It had landed partially on top of a parked town car, but no one seemed hurt. I looked back up at where the lift had fallen from, broken cables were swaying in the breeze. A crowd was slowly gathering around the lift, and I was pushed inwards closer to it. Thats when I realized something truly alarming, I hadn't seen the man's body yet. A chill rushed through me as my eyes darted across the lift looking for something, anything. I forced myself to walk onto it. I needed to know it was over for good, I needed to know he was dead. I didn't find him though, I found the last thing I ever wanted to see: another note.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I picked it up, it was almost identical to the one he left on the window. It was beaten up and covered in drops of blood. I read it. *No* I read it again. *He couldnt have*

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Between tears and blood stains in the paper the message read:

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;You should have kept the knife

 No I got the point with the "they can't understand complex sentence structure" but it just goes way too far. 




 Um, well I would say you should probably finish reading before you comment next time. Besides though, aren't comments like these not allowed? 




 Thanks dude, that means a lot. 




 Haha I thouht that a few seconds after I wrote it but by then it seemed vital to the storyline. Not really, but that was the excuse I used to keep it in. 




 Please repot back after you ask, I think we would all like to know. 




 Oh no, an incomplete jump. It seems as if he didn't even try until he was almsot the quarters of the way there. 




 I smell a Giants fan...care to weigh in, OP? 




 Its so inorganic it makes it a little painful to read. The best way to sound smart in writing is to only use words you actually use when you speak. If you want to write using fancy words, expand your vocabulary.

vendor of fuel and complex carbohydrates.

Its called a gas station, a petrol station if your British. This is the other thing that bugged me, don't go out of your way to sound smart. It's completely condescending and it makes you look desperate. 




  nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I am the man who washes your windows. Well, I am at least if you work at One Chase Manhattan Plaza. Every day, five to five, Im outside on my lift washing windows. Window by window, floor by floor, Monday through Saturday. I know what you're probably thinking, but its not all that bad. I like to work outside, and the pay is very reasonable. And when the weather gets bad or dangerous were required to stay inside but still get paid! Score!

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I began today as I do most every other day. I walk in the front door, take the industrial elevator all the way to the roof, and prepare my lift for a days work. After I make sure everything is safe and sound I start maneuvering the metal-death-basket over the side of the building. No matter how many times I do this, it will never cease to scare the living shit out of me. There is something about stepping off the edge and putting all of your life in the hands of a machine that you can never quite get used to. And on top of that, the only tiny holding you up is four tiny chords. If even one snaps, the whole thing is going down. But I try not to think about that. Once I'm actually out there I'm usually fine.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;When the hard part is over, I drop down to the 20th floor or so and then work my way back up. The lift is slow, and a peaceful long ride is a nice way to wake up.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Under normal circumstances I would have a partner up here with me, but weve been a little understaffed lately. By lately, I mean the past four months. New workers were supposed to be hired to fill the open spots, but the building manager has yet to find anyone suitable for the job. In other words, he doesn't want to pay for any more staff members and is putting it off for as long as possible. Technically that breaks a quite a few safety violations, but I dont mind. Its kinda nice to be alone out here.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;This kind of job can be pretty interesting too. Being a window washer gives you an unavoidable glance into the lives of 100 or so corporate employees on a daily basis. Whether they want me to or not, I get a front row seat to everything happening in their offices. On multiple occasions Ive seen employees sleeping, doing drugs, fist fighting, even fucking (sometimes a few at the same time). Ive even seen more than one example of corporate fraud. Employees always think if their desks face away from the door their privacy is being protected from wandering eyes, but in reality its the window they should be worried about.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Today actually turned out to be pretty boring though. For the most part, people either werent in their offices, or were doing actual work. How mundane. As I pulled up to the 47th floor the sun was already setting and people were going home. When I least expected it though, I stumbled upon something interesting. On the 47th floor there was an older woman shouting at some poor guy who had clearly royally fucked up. Her expensive looking suit implied she was some sort of executive, while his loose fitting dress shirt and pants made him look like a green intern. It was getting pretty intense in there, I could hear the muffled curses and threats through the glass. The man just stood there though and took what was coming to him. No matter how much she yelled and shouted, he would just stare back blankly. It was almost freaky how emotionlessly he was handling the situation.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The man eventually left the office and the woman sighed and returned to her desk. She noticed me for the first time then, and sent me a wry smile. I thought she would be happy to take some pent up anger out on an intern, but she didnt seem to enjoy the shouting any more than he liked being shouted at. What a terrible situation, truly a lose lose for everyone. I did my best to ignore her and keep washing the windows.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Suddenly there was another commotion in her office. The intern had returned, but this time he was the one yelling at his boss. She was clearly caught off guard, as evident by the shocked look on her face. *You idiot* I thought, *you were in the clear, shes going to fucking fire you now!* Suddenly he stopped talking and turned around to shut the door. He kept his back turned for a while, I could see the woman tilting her head to try to see what he was doing. He twisted his head towards her and smiled. Then he turned to reveal what it was he had been concealing. A huge metal knife.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I suddenly found myself paralyzed with fear. I had seen a lot through these windows, but nothing like this. Even though I was outside there was only two inches of glass between me and this psychopath. The sudden turn of events caught me completely off guard and left me almost too shocked to react. I cant even imagine how the poor woman inside must have felt. She screamed and jumped out of her chair in a helpless attempt to defend herself. It didnt do much. He rushed her, wildly screaming and swinging as he charged forward. He never stopped smiling.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;She had nowhere to run, he quickly caught her. A fine spray of red immediately stained almost an entire wall of her office. Then another. And another She laid sprawled out on the floor in a slowly growing pool of dark red. I was stunned and appalled. *This isnt happening, this isnt happening* I thought to myself, knowing full well that no matter how many times I said it it would never change what I was seeing just before my eyes.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He left the woman dying on the floor. She was no longer screaming, I dont think she had the energy left. Before she stopped moving for good though she looked back towards me. Our eyes locked. I felt a sudden rush of sadness and grief pass over me, this woman was barely clinging to life and there was nothing I could do to help her. She kept watching me as she took her last breath.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The man walked over her body to see what she was doing. He slowly bent down and traced her eye lineto me. Our eyes met. He saw me. He knows I had saw him. I panicked. I ran across the lift to my utility bag. Hands shaking, I fumbled through it. *Where is it?!* Yes! I grabbed my phone and tried to flip it open. I was rushing too quickly though, and the little phone went flying from my shaking hands and off the side of the building. FUCK! I looked back up at the office. What I saw before me made me jump backwards so hard I hit the back of the lift. He was standing in front of me, nose pressed up against the glass, grinning ear to ear. His loose clothes were torn and bloodied and his knife was still dripping wet. I was terrified, this man was a monster.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;He backed away from the glass for a moment to get something on the woman's desk. I couldnt see what he was doing, his back was to me. Like the woman had done, I tried to look around him and see what it was he was working on. He was hunched over whatever it was though, I couldnt see anything. Suddenly he spun around and slammed a piece of paper onto the inside of the window. A piece of tape kept it from falling and stuck it to the glass. Before I had a chance to examine it he shot me one last smirk and ran out of the office. I didnt hesitate, I went straight over to the paper. It was a note. I couldnt read the sloppy writing at first, but soon it came together.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Between tears and blood stains in the paper the message read:

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Youd better hope you make it to the roof before I do

 Yeah...theres a plan. 




  nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Mary loves to take selfies. Whenever I see her she insists that we take at least one. It happens so much that we have a routine. She puts her purse on her right arm, and her left arm around me. I put my right arm around her, and point at her phone with my left hand.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes become very particular about how we take these selflies. Everything must be perfect. Our hair must be neatly combed, we must stand up straight, her phone must be positioned at a perfect angle. If something doesn't go perfectly as according to plan, Mary gets angry. Very angry.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Mary stopped taking selfies in public. There are too many distractions in public. 'Too many things that can go wrong' she says. I don't mind though; its nice to have a break from it.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Mary is at my house right now. We were just sitting on the couch looking through our selfie hall of fame. Silly selfies, serious selfies, sad selfies, the list goes on and on. She has more selfies on her phone than I can even remember taking.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;"I'm thirsty" she says, "I'm going to get something to drink"

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I keep looking through our selfies. Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe. Wait. What was that? Go back. What is that? You can see it in the windows reflection. Shes holding something behind me. That's odd. That isn't in our routine. I shrug and keep swiping.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, wait

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;There it is again. You can see it in the TV's reflection now. What is she holding? Does she always do this? It's a little closer to me than it was last time. I've never noticed it before. She has never mentioned it before. I should ask her about it when she comes back.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;You can see it in the mirror now. The mirror isn't like the window or the TV. It's much, much more clear. I see what it is now. I see what shes holding behind me. Its a knife. A big, sharp, metal knife. And its getting closer.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;I don't think, I act. I grab her purse and rifle through it. Makeup, phone charger, book, ...my heart stops. There it is. Buried at the bottom of her purse. Chills shoot down my spine. I pick it up. The metal is ice cold. The blade is razor sharp. I can't take my eyes off it. I am petrified. I am terrified.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes coming back. Quick, bury the knife back in the bag. Put her purse where she left it. Don't let her see, she can never know.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Every step is louder than the last. Faster! Quietly! She can never know.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes almost here. 

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Pick up the phone. Stop breathing so quickly. Sit still. Dont look up. She just outside the doorway now. I can see her shadow moving closer.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Shes back.

 nbsp;

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;"Ready to take a selfie?"

 You're going to need to speak up, this nice *SHINY* trophy is making a lot of noise. 




 Whats that? Sorry I can't hear you over this nice shiny Lombardi trophy. 




 ...perfect spiral! 




 Because the Patriots have in fact struggled with defense many years. Either way, no team will win without a balanced team. Of course you need more than just a good quarterback to win games, but that doesn't make the quarterback any less awesome. 




 No, not really. LeBron is thought of as one of the greatest to ever play the game of basketball, regardless of things outside his control. Sherman isn't even necessarily the best in his position today. On top of that he's very arrogant. That being said, hes still very, very good and one of the best cornerbacks out there right now. 




 Richard Sherman (Seattle) and Darrele Revis (New England) are arguably the two best cornerbacks in the NFL. Them going head to head in the Super Bowl has been the cause of a lot of media attention. Tom Brady (New England) and Sherman also met once in the regular season. At the end of the game, after the Seahawks won, Richard Sherman approached Brady and said "You mad bro?". Hes known for being very arrogant and pretty full of himself.

Fast forward to the Super Bowl today. Sherman again openly taunted Revis after a blown play when he mocked his number '24' at the camera. Then the Patriots came back from a ten point deficit in the final quarter (something that has never been done in NFL history). They end up 4 points a head. Seattle look like they're about to score one final time with less than a minute left, which would have given them the lead and almost certainly the victory. Instead of safely running the ball though, Seattle elected to throw it and the Patriots came up with a miraculous interception that gave them possession of the ball for the last minute of the game. Theres a gif of Richard Sharman watching this play, he goes from all smiles as a Super Bowl champion, to completely devastated in about two seconds (it's pretty damn funny). This is him basically apologizing for being an ass, and Tom Brady respecting that. What I'm more surprised about though is whats happening outside of the picture. This was taken whils both teams got into a fairly large fight, they we're literally the only two players not fighting. I do not respect Richard Sherman as a competitor, but I very much respect him being the only person on his team not to fight and to try to make amends for being a general ass. That being said, I'm sure he would have gone right back to arrogant jerk mode if his team had won.

EDIT: By the way, LeBron James played basketball.

ANOTHER EDIT: Actually this wasn't the play with the big fight, nevermind, I'm sure he was very much involved in that. 




 Me too. I honestly thought "Fuck. Okay, they can't be stopped, just give them the touchdown with as much time as possible still on the clock"

 So many questions 




 This is very outdated, for one thing New York is 1st in the United States, San Fransisco is 2nd.

 My character is allergic to bees. Now which developer thought that was a good idea? 




 Oh my god yes, instead of grown ups handing out candy and  treats, kids could hand out beer and shots of vodka. Kids, alcohol, drunk adults, I can't think or a reason not to do this! 




 A 2003 Special Edition [Fender Splattercaster] (http://m.imgur.com/OO7zCTv), its beautiful! I got it for about $350 a few years back, and I think that was an awesome deal. The last big special editions Fender did before that was the [Bowling Ball series] (http://m.imgur.com/eYCoxzH) which go from anywhere between $3000-$7000 these days. Hopefully ten years from now mine will be worth the same! Not that I would ever consider parting with it. Ever.

I also have an 11.something carat piece of uncut Tanzanite. I'm not married or anything, I got it from an Aftican warlord I met while in Tanzania. We weren't close, he either had no idea how much it was worth, or he was *really* trying to impress me (which didn't work, I didn't know it was worth anything until I was back home for a few years). Fast forward 15 years and the Tanzanite mines are going dry and the price is skyrocketing. I plan on selling it 7-10 years down the road when the market is completely under supplied . Right now Tanzanite is worth about $700 a carat, but an appraiser told me that it's price could triple in a decade. Maybe I'll be able to but another Splattercaster! 




 Damnnnnnn 




 Yeah I would. 




 But why??? 




 Holy fuck. 




 No, but seriously. 




 What?

 




 Um, no results. 




 That...was very risky. 




 What? 




 Whoa... 




 I'll save time from Googleing this one and just assume that's what I think it is. 




 Well that Google was well worth it.  




 I once saw my friends sister laugh really hard and have 'milk' come out her nose after leaving the bathroom at Six Flags. We weren't drinking milk. Or anything. I wonder...

 Um, okay. Go on? 




 What it lacks in NSFWness it more than makes up for in weirdness... 




 ...what? 




 Whoa, I might consider a throwaway on that one. 




 Holy shit I just got a great idea... 




 So...you're not okay with it at all?... 




 Well, as it tuns out, there is a very NSFW comic book based around a 'superhero' called test_subject3655. From what I can gather, he has the power to stop time which he utilizes to fuck this same person over and over again. It might be rape, can you give consent if time is stopped? Can you fuck when time is stopped?... Its a little hard to tell because there are a few Asian words thrown in here and there-now that I think about it this sounds like something Japan would create. It is anime after all. 




 Um, the whole point of this is for 'secrets' that aren't really a big deal. If it's a big deal don't post it here...obviously. 




 Phew, glad that's cleared up. The way you worded that kinda made me think you were shitting your pants on the regular and that your 'wife' was a guy.

EDIT: 'Phew' 




 Thanks for clearing that up. 




 I had no idea this was a job.

 Ah, the great plight of the grey...

To press, or not to press-that is thy question:

Wether tis' nobler to supress

Thy temptation of the button,

To bear witness to other's vibrant blues and greens

Heedful I'll never be blessed with one of my own,

Or take arms against a sea of buttons,

And by opposing end them? To hold: to press;

No more; and by a press to say we end

The heartache the thousand natural shocks

That flesh is heir to,

'Tis a consummation

Devoutly to be wished.

Alas...

Once more into the fray,

Into the last good fight I'll ever know.

Press and repress on this day.

 Got to see this at the New York International Auto Show! Un. Be. Liebale. It looks about 3,000,000 times more incredible in real life than in pictures. There is also an Astin Martin Vulcan, Acura NSX, McLaren P1, Lamborghini Huracan, Koenigsegg Agera-the list goes on and on. If you're within a three hour drive away, you MUST go. Don't hesitate. 




 No wonder we let that colony go

Oh boy, so many corrections needed in just one statement. First of all it was not just *one* colony, but rather thirteen. Second, -well, tell me, when Birtish peope 'give' things away, do they always lose thousands of lives in the process? Because if not, the British didnt so much *give* those thirteen colonies away, as had they them taken away. By force. By most accounts an international embarrassment. Not only that, but they failed to retake those measly thirteen colonies (now states) just a few years later. But you're English, so I'll *give* you the benefit of the doubt (see what I did there? No? Read it again, a little slower this time).

 No. Sneak peak is where you get really high up on a mountain or a peak or something so you can spot the spoilers ahead. I believe it gets its name from Tikaboo Peak (sounds a lot like *peak*aboo, right?), in Nevada, where thrill seekers and conspiracy theorists alike will occasionally scale the barren wasteland to *sneak*  a *peek* at the near by Area 51. Get it? They're *sneaking* a *peek* on a *peak*... With a name like 'stealth mountain' I would have expected you to know this. Since then, the term 'sneak peak' has evolved into a few different meanings. The most popular among them meaning 'to get an early look at something that has not yet been released to the public'.

In this instance, I scaled my very thick pile of A Song of Ice and Fire books to catch a glimpse of future spoilers. The expedition was worth it, countless wonders lie at the summit. Unfortunately, all of that hard work is going to become obsolete in about ten weeks. I feel like a librarian. I just spent the last few years of my life sorting metaphorical books (and a few literal books actually), but as soon as I'm done with my life's work the Kindle comes around and suddenly all of my hard work is purposeless ancient history. Oh look, I'm ranting.

Anyhow, that's what 'sneak peak' means.

 [My favorite part] (http://i.imgur.com/rEbTrQP.png) 




 This literally happened to me once. Me and my friend were hot boxing his car, both at at least a [7] when he checked his phone and said, "Dude! Awesome news!". Oh, how wrong he was. Apparently he had just gotten a text from a girl he was trying to hook up with. She was at an 'ice cream social' and she wanted us to come join. Now at the time this did sound like awesome news. *An ice cream social!* I thought, *I've died and went to stoner heaven!* We drove off in pursuit of the delicious ice cream that awaited us.

On the way there my friend pulled into a church parking lot. Yes, a church. I didn't say anything out loud, but in my head I questioned this. *Had he made a wrong turn? Were we turning around?* Alas, we were not. Apparently, this was where the ice cream social was being held. It was at this point that I began to get worried. I almost didn't go in, but he had already told the girl we were coming, and as a bro I couldn't send him in alone. I retrospect, I totally could have and definitely should have.

Immediately upon entering I recognized many of the people there from my school. I realized I had no idea what type of group this was, so I decided to ask the girl we came to see. "Wait, he didn't tell you?" she says, "This is my churches youth group" Fuck. Fucking fuckity fuck fuck fuck fuck. Before I had time to burst out of the front doors an old woman summoned all of us to the center of the church in some sort of religious pow wow. No no no. Must. Leave. Now. Must. Find. Friend. Too late. He's already sitting down. FUCK. I run over and grab the seat next to him, all the while begging him to rush the exit with me. Again, too late. The room was silent, the old lady was taking roll call.

"Brian"

"Here"

"Sarah"

"Here"

"Kevin"

"Here"

Shes reading from a list. Thank god. Maybe she won't even notice us. Nope. That would be too easy, wouldn't it? Instead she says, "Oh! And I see we have some first timers here! Care to introduce yourself?" *FUCK NO, EVIL RELIGION LADY!!* I was high, don't judge me.

There was a silence. A silence that lasted much, much, much too long. I looked at my friend, and he looked back at me, both preying the other would answer. And then he did something that I will not forgive him for to this day. He reached in his pocket, and pulled out his phone. Instead of answering, he flipped open his phone and started texting away. I looked up. Old Lady McGee was staring directly into my eyes. I had to speak.

"Uh, hi. My name is test_subject3655"

Someone laughs. *Fuck youuuuuuuuuuuuu.* She smiles. "And why are you here today, test_subject3655?" she asks.

What?! This is a fucking interview?? I glanced back at my friend, still texting away. Shit, I was alone on this one. *Fucking hell!!! Wait, you're in a church, don't think stuff like that.* Again, I was pretty fucking high. "Um, yeah I think I just came for the ice cream." Silence. Complete, dead, silence. Not even a comforting cricket chirping away, utter silence.

"...alright." she says, before mercifully moving on to some other topic. We sat through another half hour of this before making a break for the door. Everyone knew. EVERYONE. Even Old Lady McGee probably knew. Never, ever ever again. Ever, ever, ever.

**TL;DR: Went to an ice cream social high as fuck, turned out to be a church youth group, got interviewed by an old religious lady in front of everyone.**

 I don't understand why 'liquid cheese' is such a big thing to foreigners, its not the least bit popular here. I've seen it maybe two or three times in my entire life, I don't even know where to find it to be honest. Its not something they just sell in the grocery store. I think you would have to special order it on the internet or something. Maybe 7 11. 




 1. I have no idea what you're talking about. String cheese? Cheese in a can? Hate to tell you, but most Americans would more closely associate that with poison than cheese...

2. You, sir, are as dead to me as your tastebuds apparently

 /r/humblebrag 




 I actually hate Five Finger Death Punch, this is an unbiased opinion. The fact that they're a heavy metal band is almost irrelevant, they play the song as rock. And there is absolutely no screaming, the closest they get would be the harmony during the chorus I guess. But like I said before, a piano isn't an instrument that can capture the message behind this song. There are many other songs where it can, but not this one. The Doors or Styx are good examples of song writing and composition that is perfect for a piano componet. Bad Company (the song, not the band) isn't. Its simply too mild where the song is too rugged. Kind of like playing Back in Black with a ukulele. Sure you can do it, and it will probably sound pretty cool too, but it will never compare to the raw power and passion behind the orginal song.

None of this means Bad Company is a bad original song, just that it could be better.

EDIT: Not sure why you're down voting me over a petty debate... When it comes down to it its an opinion, you shouldn't despise someone just because you disagree with them. 




 25/8/361

FTFY 




 I disagree, while it might ruin the mood of the orginal tempo, it captures the essence of the song much, much better. Its a song about breaking away from societal norms and rejecting modern customs (with regard to aggression mostly). The original version dosnt capture that at all. Five Finger Death Punch's does a much better job conveying that message and in a much more powerful way. Bad Company isn't a simple easy going song, its powerful and gritty and rugged. Where Bad Company missed the mark, Five Finger Death Punch nailed it. 




 [Bad Company] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=u_VsvZmIWxY) by Five Finger Death Punch. Oddly enough, Bad Company by Bad Company is a little bit of a let down after this version.

Also the Jimi Hendrix version of [All Along the Watchtower] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY). Devlin and Ed Sheeran did [a cool cover of that too] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iDRJwCSEcoA). A cover of a cover. Coverception.

[Fall Out Boy] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sk8Pb17pcQI) and [Alien Ant Farm] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl9ZMfj6aE) both did surprisingly awesome Michael Jackson covers.

A band called Framing Hanley did [a cover of Lil Wayne's 'Lolipop'] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vbUR0SRceD0). Its an interesting fusion of genres.

Yes? Well consider yourself lucky.
