 yet in the episode where they go to Bob's Funland, there's a flashback where all three are making fun of Bob in highschool! 




 AHH I came here to say the bacon stretcher one. I guess that's been around for a while.

But my favorite of all time is to send the new dishwashers downstairs to grab a gallon of "striped paint." 




 god damn, I never want to read another thing by a middle schooler. 




 there is no evidence. 




 Wow... This just makes me feel old. 




 uhh... it was a hyped up new technology? 




 aha, well I did some research...

 huh? Oh, I'm sorry I couldn't hear you over your smugness.

here you are.

Granted, Romney takes the liar cake. But Obama had a few slices himself. 




 is it true you gave yourself brain damage from holding your breath so frequently? 




 whatever happened to letting the haters hate? 

oh, and while I don't advocate for racism:
excuse to use the word freely.

There is no "excuse" to use words freely. There is simply the freedom to use **any** word.  




 Oh I'm sorry mate. I just meant that it's really horrible to have to include shitty old things like hit counters. No disrespect intended. 

You should just use google analytics instead. 




 are you looking to just display this as a full page embedded vid? Or, are you trying to make a background image into a video? 




 ugh. That's really horrible. 




 waitwait, sexual harassment? There is a very clear line between being forward and harassing someone.
Legally speaking, I suppose. I mean, she could go around telling people that you're a pig... but, honestly wtf cares? 




 This is the problem with nice/shy guys. They use that as an excuse for being a pussy. 




 god damn. poor poor bastard 




 "is that what a real man looks like?" 




 Life will make you into a cynical asshole yet. 




 False. I am talking about that word being used as a general pejorative.

Your argument is based on the idea that this word is no longer a homophobic slur. That is patently false.

you contradict yourself to make a point, and then you mention honesty about the meaning of the word. I don't know what this honesty is meant to refer to, a literal definition of the word or its connotations? 
The use of faggot as a pejorative is an augmentation of its once literal definition anyway. And emotional reactions to the word have everything to do it. If the word Faggot didn't inspire negative emotions in people then we wouldn't be having this conversation to begin with. 

and a correction: I know the word still can be used as a homophobic slur, that's not my argument. I'm saying that it is also taking on a new meaning, one that denotes -- as you said -- a general pejorative. Not a specific homophobic slur. 

EDIT: and for these reasons, you're argument is tautological. 




 The use of homophobic slurs is homophobic.

The argument: that this use of the word in a certain context is in fact not homophobic.

Your argument assumes the correctness of "faggot" always being used as a homophobic slur. It even goes so far as to imply that if **both** user and target have reached an agreement previously to not treat "faggot" as homophobic, but instead as part of their vocabulary of playful denigration, it still is a homophobic slur. 

If this were the case, all words would remain static. This is clearly not so. Also, I think it's pretty clear that a community such as reddit is by nature very opposed to homophobia. This establishes a sort of redefinition of what it means to use words previously defined as homophobic slurs. 

AND, one more thing. Words are words and only people give them power to hurt. If you treat "faggot" with such seriousness, it only deems the word necessary when spouting vitriol. Much like the word nigger has been used. The best thing to do is use the word with utter farce, lampoon it's own hateful meaning.  




 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IFloXOuLgA

simply put. 
and plus, your arguments are full of tautologies, because they're full of tautologies. That, and some obligatory reference to civil rights.  




 I would give a body part to get a sequel to the original FFT on the ps3. 




 I mean, not like shaved clean. Like, babybottom kind of shaved.

But bro, you got to trim that shit up. 




 Ok, I'm sorry. 

But the people on here telling you to confront your mother and threaten to tell your father can go fuck themselves. Well, perhaps not that. But I think it is the wrong way to approach the situation. This is based off of the principle that this is none of your business. Just be an adult and talk to her. Keep it between you and her. Get her perspective. It is most likely the case that there is some dynamic between your father and mother that is completely unknown to you. Affairs happen, this is just part of real life. Don't go bulldozing through your family just because you're too offended that your mother wants a proper dicking from some other guy.

I understand this comes across as harsh. Hopefully it isn't taken as malicious. 




 Russian. I love the way russian sounds. It also makes you better at tricking people.

 reading that was like getting sand in my eyes. 




 so instead they just hang themselves... nbd 




 Well, this was a big waste of time. 




 nobody panic, jawathehutt is doing research on it. 




 Honestly, I hate to be that guy... but I hate it when people start packing until the prof says "see yah later" or the equivalent of such. 




 I don't get anything. But this kid I used to work with in the kitchen was named Craig. And somehow, it became a thing that everybody would say "C'mon craig, how you gonna get fired on your day off?"

This was unappreciated 




 do you feed him lasagna?

 your professors don't care about you. 




 hum... Surprised I am that this is on front page and not controversial. +1 for you sir, even if this is a repost ;) 




 Any toy for my kids is a huge waste of money

are you Louis CK? 




 Again, wrong.

Modern philosophy is *not* applied psychology. What you may be referring to is Naturalized Philosophy, which is a specific branch of philosophy. And even then, it's not so much applied psychology as it is applied "let's accept some empirical facts about the world"

Modern science is by definition a conglomeration of facts based off of a philosophical framework. Much like Aristotelian physics and the geocentric model, the standard model and quantum physics. 

Not all philosophy is speculative, in the same way that some fields of scientific research *are* speculative. 

I'm not here to make value judgements. There is no "better than the other." But I'm also going to give philosophy it's credit where credit is due. A lot of people forget the history that Philosophy and Science have together. They used to be in love, you know. 




 thank you. 




 I encourage this discussion. Especially when alcohol is involved. 




 There is so much awesome in this. 




 This is really untrue. There is fathoms more to Philosophy than  the subjectivity of the human condition. 
Not too long ago, Science was a proper branch of philosophy. 
Also, logic and analytic philosophy. These are found at the foundations of the scientific method and formally part of the philosophical tradition.

In other words, philosophy embodies almost all fields of study. Even mathematics.  




 ya man, I second this. I mean, it sucks that you threw away all of your old work, but it all has to do with perspective. You could look at it in a liberating kind of way... In the sense that you're no longer bound to what you've created in the past.

This might sound like a load of bullshit. But it's either that, or live in the turmoil of knowing you don't have some stuff you made in highschool. Im not into the visual arts myself, but I have two really really good friends (one painter, one illustrator) that are both out of college. And they are both terribly embarrassed of what they did in highschool. Not in an ashamed way, just a "oh wow, I've improved so much" kind of thing. 

...So yeah, keep at it bro. 




 ya. And then get downvoted into oblivion for pointing it out on a popular one.

 mmm good old bagged milk? 




 This is not so much a problem if said girl had a nice ass* and you were staring at it. 




 really puts a plot hole in the whole episode... 




 this is true. 




 nono, it was. 




 You are a giant faggot. I don't even know why I read the comments any more. The fact that the author got downvoted for explaining why they did something blows my fucking mind.  




 bravo, kind sir. 




 yup 




 this is a poorly worded question. 




 cowboy bebop, samurai champloo, full metal alchemist: brotherhood.
watch these, and you won't be able to stop. 




 oh my god. I can here to say exactly this! 




 OH! 




 perhaps plot is the wrong word.  




 meh. Not so hot, not so cold. 




 Dude, if you want to use leaves to wipe your ass, then more power to you. 

I, personally, enjoy the better things that the economic society has produced, not just luxury. For example, modern culture.  

You can go live in the woods, grow you're own food and make houses out of sticks and stones. I'll be busy reading books. 




 yes, yes there was. 




 meh. In my opinion, anybody who isn't interested in the plot of Cowboy Bebop or FLCL is plain toast in my book.

Now, if you're going to go and start talking to people about Inuyasha or Naruto, then that's a different story entirely. 




 this picture is so old, why is this on the front page of reddit? blahblahblah, and other complaints. 




 Im gonna bet my money on Java.

 This is a stupid question. 
If it was done forcefully, absolutely not.
If your girlfriend didn't mind, then who gives a shit?

Homosexuality has nothing to do with invading the space of other human beings. 




 can we get some sources in this motherfucking thread? 




 This is a typical 16 year old response. 




 they're probably just predetermined at the start of a battle. In which case, who cares. Still semi-random, just not in the "in the moment" kind of way. 




 I can't belive this got downvoted so much 




 let me tell you why this is bullshit:
There's no way the farmer can completely sustain himself. 
Let's assume he's using simple tools (hoe, axe, rake etc..) He either needs to greatly increase his work time, or greatly increase his manpower for maintenance on the farm.
If he is doing this by himself, he very little time to do anything else (harvest the crops, store them, sleep, eat, be human). 
If he has extra workers, what compensation do they receive? Let's assume there is no money, and that they are paid in the crops that are grown. Then that means more food has to be grown for each new worker we introduce. Even if none of these people had family members that didn't work on the farm this would be a challenging task.

On top of that, and I know it sounds silly, but where did he get his house, his hat, his clothes, and (in the picture) his little grill? Let's ignore the grill. How did he build his house? He doesn't have time for that he's too busy using hand tools to grow enough food for the year. Did he pay for it with crops?
Ah, so now we have some people that build houses and some people that grow vegetables. When one wants to eat, they *trade* skills for food, and vice-versa when the other needs shelter.
This extends outward, and gets increasingly complex. Which is why we have money in the first place, because in order to maintain any basic standard of living (even the most conservative) it is next to impossible to do anything without trade. And if we're trading crops for houses, we might as well have this universal medium so we can get things from people that don't want houses or crops without going through a long list of trading to get something else; say, honey, toilet paper, cars, pencils, straw hats or little tiny grills.
 




 true. and that 0.01% stays there because being a nice guy is the equivalent to being a single-mom.

 This is actually a type of ghost. To find a pet peeve, you'll need to get your hands on a very scientific device. My guess is that most people who claim to have one are lying, as most cannot actually "see" a peeve, but must experience one. 




 Yeah, I feel that. If I am in to her, I usually just assume flirting. Flirting and friendliness can be very similar anyway. Just because I girl is flirting with you doesn't mean she's going to have sex with you. 
























 the problem is... everyone would just assume you were homeless. Those guys are always doing zany things.  




 5? why not more? 




 why do you hate football? 




 this is very similar to me. I often just talked to myself as if I was talking to some of my friends, just imagining how they would respond.

 this. if someone is making fun of you for drinking water... I have nothing.

 any pharmacy, walmart or places like these. 




 okay, here's one:

I grew up in a small small town in Massachusetts and the house that my family was living in at the time had a lot  of forest behind it. I wish I could tell you how much acreage-wise, but up until I was probably 17 I used walk through the woods back there and I never hit the small road that was on the other side.

So, one of my favorite things to do was go out during January/February after a couple of good snows had fallen. All the brambles and undergrowth had died out and you could follow animal tracks forever. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a good at tracking animals or anything, it was just fun to see what animals were running around out there. I was always looking for Bobcat tracks... but anyway, I digress.

I was probably 15 at the time, I had just gotten out of school and it was this time of year and not too cold. I started out, and chose to go a way out that I had been in the summer, but it had gotten too think to move any further. So I'm walking. and walking. for probably 45mins or so, perhaps a bit longer. I stopped for a moment to get my bearings, realizing that I'd never come this far in this direction. I look around a bit, and then take few more steps forward. And then slowly, I start to hear this music. Not complex at all, it sounded like a pipe or flute. The melody was very simple, five notes total, repeating in two phrases. I was scared... mostly because encountering anybody this far out in the woods could go bad. 

So I stood there. The music just kept going, steady and not relenting. I was too afraid to go anywhere closer, but I still just wanted to listen, to see if anything happened. Finally, after about fifteen minutes of listening, my fear got the best of me and I went home. 

I was pretty upset with my self the second I got home, so I decided that the next day after school I'd go back, retrace my steps and go see what was going on. I did, and there was absolutely nothing. No footprints in the snow, no houses, nothing. Just fresh powder underneath a pine grove. 

That is the weirdest thing that's happened in my life by far. I always went back to that place to try and figure out if there was any little cabins or homeless shacks in the area. Never found anything... kind of spooky.

TLDR, I heard some weird music in the middle of the woods.   




 in watching the gif I thought they were falling to their deaths... I'm very happy they weren't.
 




 wow! that's funny! 




 interesting. Link to the study? 




 Brohonestly, you can't identify yourself on Reddit.  




 nonono, its to prevent the brim from getting oily when you touch it with your grubby hands.  




 I can verify this. 




 I actually don't mind this one so much... 




 ugh. Those shitty cheap Fedoras. Terrible, TERRIBLE I SAY! 




 damn, I'm sorry to hear that you have to drive a boat on wheels... you probably should have spent less time procrastinating in college.  




 being a 5'4" male and living anywhere, I've gotten used to this feeling. 




 nope. 




 I have seen this done on a FN show with making pancakes (or something similar) and I also once read the steps to do this in an old french cookbook:

where you separately mix egg yolks and flour together to get this yellowish paste. Then afterwards, add milk and other ingredients. Does this have a specific name? I've wanted to read about it for a while... how to do it right, what it does etc... 




 just out of curiosity, do you have any science to back up both this analogy and also the general premise that this is (a) harmful to the animal and (b) technically considered animal abuse.

If so, then shit, I've got egg on my face.
If not then

Science motherfucker, have you heard of it? 




 this comment of mine is going to get down voted. But that aside,

please just shut the fuck up. For the love of god.  




 me too man 




 you know, I agree with this. But before everyone starts to shit on me, I'd just like to explain.

All feelings are valid, in that they are phenomenally there. But some feelings/responses can be misguided. For example,

"When you go out with your friends without me, I feel like you are avoiding me and that makes me think you don't value our relationship. It would make my life better if you took me out with your friends ALL THE TIME."

now of course this is an unhealthy statement. I'm not arguing that it's not. But these are legitimate feelings that are completely off base. (Specifically I know this, because it happened to me once upon a time.)

 




 well that's funny 




 huh... I can't feel my hands today. Oh well, two Tylenol and it's off to work I go! 




 Im going to upvote you because you say wildly unpopular things on reddit. Good job. 




 I never thought of it that way. Have an upvote. 




 that might not be what he said. 




 I honestly think that it's more complicated than this. Namely, that min. wage earners are poor and need money to survive. People will do funny things to survive. 




 some people don't want to be helped. Not everyone solicits help with life decisions... This is what bothers me about smoking. There is so much literature and research that shows how harmful it is. 

I consciously don't give a shit. I smoke.  




 damn you family guy!! DAMN YOU!!! 




 you know.... I expected this. I expected it, and you delivered.  




 that is some of the most gnarly shit I've seen in a while 




 Ah, good sir, I've been had. Have some upvotes... even if people hate me in this thread. 




 Soo.. when do we get the video of this bug presented on a plate to be enjoyed for it's delicious, delicious meat dunked in butter?

 I am mad because you didn't draw realistic versions of people! rahrahrah!

 I'm sorry... but it is ridiculous enough to wager a guess at who might run in 2016. Four years is a political eternity. But 2024? Who the fuck knows what's going to be happening in the world, never mind who might be running for pres. 

...not that I really am that invested here. You're comment just made me giggle.   




 I wouldn't actually be that surprised. 




 agreed. My views are often pretty unpopular because of this line of thought.    




 hahaha, I can't believe you got downvoted for that. 




 dildochrist, absolve me of my sins! 




 oh you get um 




 calm down. you're on the internet. 




 It's crazy, I just watched a Google IO talk by Colt McAnlis that got me feeling really good about multiplayer html5 games. I come here, and find a course he's teaching. Today is going to be a good day. 




 agreed 




 You are fucking ridiculous! I never said that that's what I wanted to do. Stop being such a reactionary. 

I even began this whole thing with "I honestly don't **feel** so good about it." 




 It's strange, because I feel that you're the one trying to muddy the issue. I suppose it would be foolish to take this argument any further, because I can only see now that we will not reach a middle ground. 

just one thing:
it's about the fact that pornography is not a healthy basis for understanding sexuality from a biological angle and I think that 8 years old is to young to be taught about sexuality from an instructional angle.

You are upset, from what I've gathered, that he knew the distance between the holes. This seems strictly anatomical. But also remember that one hundred and fifty years ago, pinup girls would have been seen as hardcore porn, and a child seeing a girl's ankle would have been unhealthy. 

I'm not trying to muddy the issue, I'm trying to withdraw my feelings from a controversial subject in order to find some truth. It would appear that you cannot help but inject your feelings into it and conceal them as fact. 




 I mean, I honestly don't *feel* so good about it. But I'm not sure if there is really any inherent reason for this to be wrong.

For example, I would have no qualms about a 16 year old bringing an 8 year old to an art museum where there were nudes on display (painted, or otherwise). The line between what we deem as "smut" and tastefully done -- is in my mind -- nonexistent. 

Furthermore, and why I asked if you had a specific argument, is simply the question of how diegojones4 felt about the whole thing at the time. It seems like he was alright with it. And if that were the case, then quiet literally no one was harmed here.

 Is it that you feel sad because you had an innocence at that age that you would like to hold on to, and therefore it bothers you that someone else did not have that same innocence? If that's the case, then, yes spell it out. There's no reason to go on making moral arguments based on silly little feels.  




 Oh please. He was not suggesting that children have sex. Please stop using the internet. 




 is there a biological argument for your sadness? Or are you just sad for the sake of it? 




 logic! 




 A good Heineken product placement 




 wow, the water on those rocks looks great 




 My apologies mate, hope the best for you and you're kids. 




 As long as there were rules in place to prevent a pissing contest between candidate and fact-checker. It would have to be heavily moderated and have a clear format.

I would watch either way, really. The sad thing is that even with experts fact-checking in real time, people would still cling to partisan feelings and thus the debate would be spun based off of those inclinations. I have a feeling very little would be accomplished, it would just be a longer and more educational debate. But when it came down to it, people would hear what they wanted to hear and the experts would matter very little.

Actually, it would probably just prove to be a big shit show for the experts. Their careers would probably be under such scrutiny after trying to prove Mitt Romney or Barack Obama wrong that after the first one, no one would step up. 




 it must have something to do with the squirrels phone number 




 you're picture is too big and I hate it! 




 eh, you let a little affair ruin your whole marriage huh? 




 his is a common misconception. It's actually done with a long piece of string.
 




 who's that? 




 you just had that thought, eh? 




 blahblahblah wear your seatbelts.

Listen, everyone's going to get on their high horse about wearing a seatbelt. Personally, I wear one. But I dont give a godamn fuck about about what anyone else decides to do. 




 hah, I don't need a throwaway for that one.

 rawk  




 stop yar bitchn and dig in matey.

 bout a pack a day. sometimes less. on a really ragin party night, I do mayhaps a pack in that night. But usually I want nothing to do with smoking that next day.

I am not proud of this. 




 I switch between camel filts and camel lights. 

I don't pick a lucky. My last one is always an emergency and I invariably will light it backwards.

You will look back on this post someday and think, "goddamn, why did I think smoking was so fun?" 




 go away, and never come back. 




 came here to say this.

You got to earn your red wings someday, son. 
























 it sounded like a yoke 




 as somebody who barely makes 25k working shit hours in a kitchen, 100k is a milestone to wealth and prosperity for me.

 dude, working for google means you get dibs on tickets for Google IO, which is in it's self worth it. 




 It's crazy that that shit happens, I have an aunt threw same way. 




 you know... I'm going to take this goddamn moment to complain. When I was her age, we went out, and got a godamn fake ID. Or, we just borrowed someone's ID and said, "welp, hope I don't get this shitty expensive thing I just bought taken away from me..." But now, no. No no no. Now, you first have to get on reddit and validate you're actions with some anonymous other people. BAH! 

...I'm a bit drunk right now. 




 Yeah... Yeah, they do. 




 how, may I ask, is this nsfw? 




 perhaps I'm heartless. But if that were me, I'd have that cat back at my parents before that girl could even give me the sads. I'm across the country and I still love my cat. 




 Now is the time to begin cultivating skills that you enjoy doing. Skills can always be applied to different careers later in life. 




 your uncle Jerry is a good man, 




 yup 




 you can pull off a fedora with a polo, chinos and boat shoes. 




 Wearing a fedora is fine in my book if:

* You are wearing appropriate clothes that would warrant a fedora.

* The fedora is not a twenty dollar piece of shit you bought at hot topic
 




 You sure taught her... You fucking ass clown. 




 lol I cannot believe you are getting downvoted for this shit. This is a general trend of ignorance that's getting greater by the day. 

But anyway, in the case of hitting a dog I **pretty sure** that you're partly right here. But reporting it being legally required depends on specific counties. Now, if it damages your car... You can report it to the police and then go after the owner.  




 It looks better on him. 




 It is very interesting. I wasn't disagreeing with you, just throwing my two cents in... I grew up with two teetotaling parents. Well, one really, and one that was just in constant recovery. 

As a kid, I often thought exactly what your comment was saying. 




 pretty sure you're wrong. 




 It's about fucking time. 




 I would like to say that it is a wrong strategy. 




 not being able to keep a steady job, or maintain a healthy relationship because you have to drink. Drinking so much that it could potentially kill you if you stopped. 

I drink, but I've also seen how alcohol ruins lives. 

Cigarettes will give you a heart attack at 55 maybe, or put a hole in your throat, or fill your lungs up with delicious tar etc etc... But booze can turn a person into a shade of what they were.  




 I laughed. 




 congrats, you ruined a man's life forever because of a petty childhood relationship. 




 uhh, what fucking signs of autism are you seeing exactly? 




 This comment should get more upvotes.

 amen, brother. Shitty girls are shitty. 




 The idea, I believe, is to buy it in small quantities from many locations as to not draw attention.  




 This trick saved me in college. I was fortunate enough to have an awesome Russian professor who taught the whole class how to use the debugger and debugging techniques in my first year programming class.

 I just snorted coffee through my nose...

 I'm kind of into bridges myself. I found a whole case of eggs under a bridge last week. Perfect condition. None of them missing, none of them cracked. I mean, who in their right mind throws away a perfectly good case of eggs in this day and age.

 I was a little shy in high school, but I had a couple of girlfriends and wasn't afraid to socialize, fell into a few cliques etc... I'm not sure if many high schools are like this in the country, but I grew up in an extremely controlled environment. We were not allowed to leave the building for any reason whatsoever with out a proper escort (usually the hall monitor, or school police officer), and were to be under constant supervision between school operating times. For after school activities, an adult was to be present at all times.

Now, I know that these precautions were taken for legality issues, but my point is that we were treated like children in an unhealthy way. I also know that under the eyes of the law most of us were still legally children. But the negative aspect of this type of coddling led to discouraging a lot of the kids there from doing important things early on.

Okay, so now to my point. When I got into college I still felt like a kid. I did well in school, I did well in life (mostly) but I had no fucking idea that I could actually **DO** things. I spent so much time in the later parts of high school feeling like anything I tried to accomplish wouldn't be taken seriously because I was still a child, and feeling discouraged because I thought that anything I tried to do independently would be perceived as childish, that I ended up doing nothing at all. I only realized that I had an ability to accomplish things greater than assignments and orders from older people when I was almost finished with college. And this, I feel, put me at a serious disadvantage. I realized later in life than some that the most important aspect of accomplishment is taking initiative. I was too happy going to school, having friends and getting drunk because it was what I was "supposed to be doing." 

**TLDR: I regret not realizing that I could take life by the balls in high school** 




 This is actually sound advice if you work in a kitchen. 




 hahaha, in all fairness he did say, "Jay-Z is in the empire business," a little while ago. 




 came here for all the pansies yelling about abuse. leaving only mildly disappointed cause I had to scroll down a bit. 




 Oh! I doubt I'm going to give you any ammo for "abuse" really. I didn't really consider at the time that you may have been joking, and was trying to point out that the statement is idiotic because what the original poster said had nothing to do with linking the evolutionary fertility of rabbits to gas powered lawn mowers. 

Simply that rabbits have to be so fertile because they so often choose poor locations for their nests. The guy was offering consolation, in that for some little bunnies that get mowed to pieces, hundreds more are getting eaten by various predators cause momma rabbits can't get their shit straight. So there will be more of these little fuckers running around in no time, which is great to think about when you just accidentally chopped a bunch of them up. He was offering consolation, not applying for a grant to study the evolutionary traits of rabbit breeding. 

And that, good sir, is why you were an idiot for posting that remark. But hey, you got the karma for it... so it looks like I'm the one with egg on my face.  




 No! I'm going to take this side of the story: you didn't fuck up at all. It should be fine for you to have pictures of naked girls and have a girlfriend. You shouldn't be embarrassed about any of it. She needs to be secure enough to know that a male can and will view pornography regardless of whether or not he's got a fuck buddy, gf or wife. Plain and simple. 




 dude don't even worry! now the pressure is off of you. She knows, and you know that she knows. Now you don't have to hide the fact that you are making certain life decisions for yourself. 

edit

To be clear... I'm not saying you should or shouldn't be doing anything. Just that you are becoming a man now. 




 start going in drunk! they can never accuse you again! 




 yup. You fucked up big time d00d. 




 I think it would most likely fall under libel... but anyway, I'm not a lawyer, but these charges are usually avoided if you can prove you were not doing it with the intent to defame and instead had the intent to make a farce of, or lampoon the subject. 




 aww, not the worst thing in the world. I'm sure the boyfriend and friend didn't mind a whole lot ;) 




 I prefer to take the Gob route with, "Hey guy!" 




 I want to pet the penguin 




 You are an idiot for posting this. 




 The falcon is fine. It flies off every day. During that time it's probably eating whole prey. It's flying back because it's got one of those smart raptor brains. 




 Implying that Huskies are really strong? Or really good dogs? 




 how to cook a fucking meal! and not some simple shit like boiling pasta and adding canned tomato sauce. Or make pancakes in the morning.

You shouldn't be afraid to cook any kind of meat. Knowing how to prepare simple chicken, pork and beef dishes is important. Also, know what vegetables are and how to use them.

This skill is so useful in life, because it will get you laid.  




 I don't think that you should be desensitized to listen to/watch something like this. It's about understanding the thing that happened and knowing that it did. Perhaps there is some kind of catharsis involved as well. 
It's similar to Eisenhower wanting the world to see what the nazis had done in the concentration camps. Not only desensitized people went to view the atrocities, many people went for different reasons. And we still learn about them today as a reminder of the fucked up things that have happened in history in order to potentially prevent them from happening again. 

I guess to sum things up, "it's great to learn, 'cause knowledge is power!" 




 yeah, It's really easy to say things like this. But enduring months upon months of barely eating will drive you crazy. I'm sure that these were good people, for the most part. 




 watch a movie. 




 could you perhaps offer some justification for your opinion? or are you just some troll? 




 I think... I think I love you. 




 man this used to work for me... but now it just makes me paranoid, and coupled with being hungover, I feel like I'm going to die. :( 




 you think that's bad. Try watching someone at a casino screaming about getting more of their money. 




 I think mostly because we read the news for the reporting of facts. Creative style shouldn't have to be parsed from an article to understand the facts. Embellishment leads to misrepresentation. 

Also, I would find it very annoying if I had to read this shit when I was trying to get my news in on the bus to work.  




 okok.. so is this a new thing we're doing? It's like the fourth time I've seen this tonight. 




 nor should they 




 no
