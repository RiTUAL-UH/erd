 I can understand if you came to the US from the UK, but why is it such mainstream news in the US?

Edit - I should include every other country that is part of the crown.

 From the way the counter seems to be behaving, it doesn't look like it will be easy to get a 60s unless a bunch of people click it all at the same time. 

Shows i was part of the OP and clicked without even thinking what it was. I originally thought you would just get a stupid April fools joke, now it seems the joke is on the people that didn't press it from the start. 












































 Youtube and netflix have been giving me all kinds of problems lately. In the last 24 hours they have slowed to a crawl and don't even load. The last year or two i have had the same issues but never this bad. I feel like verizon is trying to piss me off.

This happens with any of my systems including xbox and playstation. I've reset my router, but with my limited knowledge the tracert says it isn't even my end of the network.

thanks

edit - i should add that this computer is the only thing turned on right now and no other devices are streaming or sharing. 




 or just post a cat picture. 

Cats are the best.

 I am a middle of the road kind of person and i think the money involved in politics is mind blowing.

I grew up with grandparents on both sides, my parents vote republican. I don't see things the way they do and i seem to vote the opposite of them.

Edit - i should add that my grandparents weren't communists after reading some of these comments.
 



















 I don't have pictures at the moment, but can take some tomorrow.

While researching what product i should get, i came across [this.](http://www.alphasystemsinc.com/ProductCare) 


 Rubber roof (also known as EPDM) membranes are smooth. TPO and Alpha-Ply roof membranes have a haircel texture, which can be likened to an orange peel.


Was looking at [this product](http://www.epdmcoatings.com/rv-roof-repair.php) and it says 


 For Fleetwood models with ALPHA roofs you will need to use the ProFlex Primer



I'm pretty sure mine is a TPO/Alpha-Ply type roof since it is a Fleetwood and then would need to put down a primer before the rubber coating. The top of the RV is black in color and is not smooth so this makes me think it is not a rubber roof.


This seems the best way to fix it. 

Edit - am back from getting beers 




 Clear your social calendar. We have to cook. 




 Just send me a pm 




 I live in the Los Angeles area and i'm not a pro chef by any means. I enjoy all types of food and am willing to experiment at least once. 

will add more if this takes off

Edit -
Looks like we are off to a great start. Welcome everybody!

 I was curious what everyone else uses for insulin for their cats. I've been using a bottle of lantus since my vet diagnosed him with diabetes, but it is almost out. The vet said he had ordered it by mistake and would let me have it for $50. When I checked the price for a bottle at the local CVS they want $230.

I've been told about many other options but would like some input from the real catlovers.

Thanks

 An above ground crude oil pipeline just burst gushing 50k gallons of crude oil so far. 

http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Thousands-of-Gallons-of-Oil-Spill-in-Atwater-Village-259354591.html

When looking into it, LA just 3 days ago had a training on how to manage oil spills...

It is amazing on how fast news has picked this up

 I've noticed a few new accounts that have been posting lately in /r/pics and /r/funny and saw a familiar routine with a few of them. Going through the post history of these accounts led me to

/r/usedcarsforsale which is a fairly new sub and if you notice all the posts being made are by user accounts that are only a few weeks old.

if you look at some of the users that post in that sub, you will see that they are trying to post generic photos for exposure and also post the used car ads to the used car sub.
