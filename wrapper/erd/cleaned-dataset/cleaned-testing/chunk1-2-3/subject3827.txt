 The Ricky Gervais Show 




 *Hello,* Nedry 




 I sorta felt that Rise was both Escape and Conquest, while Dawn was more Conquest/Battle - either this will just be Battle, or Battle/Apes 




 I hope they change it to War *on* the Planet of the Apes, I think that sounds better 









 Too bad for you man 




 Seriously, that stuff is incredible 




 Well, thankfully it wasn't Hank Azaria or one of the main family members - I don't think they'd be able to go on without them 




 Huh 




  uses his God powers to send these legitimate practical effects to his son and our savior, Jorge Millir 




 Disney knows what they're doing 




 I Love Lucy 




 It's like poetry, it rhymes.

FTFY 




 Scrambled 




 They're kinda cute, actually. 




 If you could give birth to an animal, what would it be? 




 Okaya I wonta 




 Well, it didn't take me that long to make - I'll try to clean it up a little - add music, make the cuts a little less rough - what else? 




 Empire Strikes Back, Godfather Part II, LotR: Return of the King, The Dark Knight 




 What, the 5 minutes it took me to make? 




 So it's okay to put a written version of this plot leak, but not a visual? 




 Oh shoot! 57 seconds of your precious life down the drain!

Oh, and no one forced you to watch it. 




 Soylent Green... IS PEOPLE! 




 Nah, it's the same thing has having a nose in the middle of your face - it's right there, and it seems like it would be a distraction, but you don't really notice it. 




 Yeah, I can't believe they gave him those 3 Oscars! Ugh, how stupid of those "academy members" to reward good filmmaking! 




 Throw up your hands and raise your voice! 




 The ring came off my pudding can! 




 Well, sorta Jar Jar for giving Palpatine his power  




 Ricky Gervais' stand up is pretty hilarious  




 Yeah, but the question wasn't "which fact do you not believe is true?" 




 That's not only not socially acceptable, but insane. I hope you were joking. 




 That's where, we found... 




 Any way the wind blows, 




 My favorite
 




 Doubt it 




 The Man Who Knew Too Much 




 Yup, because the only people who see these billion dollar movies are mouth breathing fanboys. 




  Bash your brains in

 Oh gawd this bothers me so much.

Sorry 









 Then post it in /r/musicvideos or something. 




 So May 1994?

 Really? I've never heard of this vastly underrated film! 




 Right, but they are 2 completely different mediums. Paintings can use visual storytelling, doesn't mean it's something you discuss in a movie-focused setting. 




 I can't wait till they release a new LEGO Star Wars game with TFA included 




 Why is this being asked in /r/movies? 




 Really? And all the other fake plot rumors and trailer "leaks" aren't? At least I'm reporting on a piece of news that's actually true... 




 Who was making that point? 




 Ugh, I guess I have to:

Le *Interstellar* 




 You can't try a food for the first time and not like it, and then have someone explain why they like it and it changes your opinion.

I totally agree. 




 C'mon, it's not *that* expensive  




 No, it's just the article with the same pics 




 Yuuuuppp 




 Well, everything about this looks more promising than the prequels... 




 No - I just meant I have it digitally - i don't have early access or anything. Besides, im sure it'll be online Monday. 




 In the Apple newsstand store 




 I meant out digitally - it's not like I have exclusive access to it or something... 




 Yeah, it was sorta obvious.

Just tryin' to be a good person. 




 Actually, Empire Strikes Back is the Pig in the City of Star Wars movies 









 Alright, but you're the one who couldn't understand a simple joke. I really couldn't care less. 




 Seriously, I'm confused now. I'd love to help you explain it, but now I'm not even sure what you're referring to. 




 Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan 




 Less than 5 years ago, this was just a dream. And now it's actually happening. I can't believe it.

I hope it doesn't suck! (It won't) 




 I'm glad they're taking the starting-over route, and the ending leaves a lot of possibilities as well.

Thoughts? 









 I was having this debate with a friend the other day, and he said that a movie doesn't need to have a central lesson or message to take away from it to be good.

I disagreed, and I still think it's one of the most important parts of film.

What do you think? What (well-liked) movies don't have this, but are still good? 




 Lord Nolan also appreciates the Kevin James directed psychosomatic-thriller.









ayy lmao 




 Now don't get me wrong. The Dark Knight is not, by any means, a bad movie. It is well acted, well directed, and very well put together. But as a superhero movie, and as a movie in general, it falls down in a few places.

1 We don't get emotionally involved with our characters. In movies like Superman or Spider-Man, our characters show that they are humans, and they have struggles. Superman literally moves the world back in time to save the person he loves. Spider-Man never knows whether he should reveal his true self to his friends and enemies. Batman just says he's the good guy. He doesn't show it, and you probably wouldn't care if he died.

2 Why so much violence? Seriously, why does every car or building need to get shot at or blown up? It should be a battle between the hero and the villain, not the hero and the villain and the rest of the world. It doesn't need to happen, and it shouldn't. Maybe a few times, but it shouldn't detract from the story itself.

TL,DR: - this is NOT a bad movie, but there are much better superhero films

EDIT: or a 94% on RT, the ideas still apply 




 Sometime before or after the release of The Godfather Part III, Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola came up with a potential sequel idea. It would have been a similar style to Part II, switching back and forth from Vito's early days as Don in the 1930s (as well as the early years of his children's lives), and Vincent as the new Don in the 1980s. Vincent takes a turn from his predecessors, and gets the Corleone family involved with narcotics again. It would have ended with his death. 

More info can be found [here](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Corleone), under "abandoned sequel"

Do you think this could've worked? 









 I have a friend who literally cannot watch movies made before the year 2000. 

Some examples:

Thought that Star Wars was "too slow," Back to the Future is "cheesy" and Hitchcock is boring.

I need a 20th century movie that quickly gets into the plot, looks good, has a good pace, and good acting. His favorite movies are The Social Network and Nightcrawler.

I hope someone can help! 




 My reaction after seeing it again:

Good stuff:
- Thoroughly enjoyable
- Not lazily made or incompetently made
- Basically a dino horror movie

Bad stuff:
- Sort of a stereotypical plot
- Kind of the same movie as 1 and 2 
























 I feel like Stanley Kubrick and George Orwell's novels were perfect for each other. Animal Farm and 1984 have similar concepts and themes as A Clockwork Orange, 2001, and Dr. Strangelove.

What do you guys think? 



















 Either unprotected or with a space suit -

How would it be different than on Earth? 




 Best letter ayy lmao amirite???

 




 It's called 2001: A Space Odyssey 




 Mine are:

5) Dr. No

4) Casino Royale

tied with

3) Goldeneye

2) Skyfall

1) Goldfinger 




 If one were to make a re edited version of Return of the Jedi, what would the basic plot look like? What would needed to be changed/taken out? 




 An idea I had for the highest grossing movie of all time:

Director: Christopher Nolan 

Producer: James Cameron

Writers: Joss Whedon +                      
              Quentin Tarantino

Starring: Leonardo Di Caprio, Christian 
               Bale, Jennifer Lawrence, 
               Scarlett Johansson

Music: Hans Zimmer

Cinematography: Emmanuel Lubezki

Visual Effects: Weta Digital


What would you pick? Anything to add or change? 

EDIT: Spielberg as co director, also with Chris Pratt

EDIT 2: The plot is a cross between Interstellar, Inception, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Obviously. 




 I also thought John Wick and CHAPPiE were amaze

Cinnamontography A+++ 




 Mine are:

Star Wars
Jaws
Jurassic Park
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Planet of the Apes
Back to the Future
Rope
Singin in the Rain
All the President's Men
12 Angry Men 









 Ex:

Half Life 3 speed run record, set on May 27th 3476 









 IMO they're all great. 









 I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but which movie was the one where Rocky said "every champion was once a contender who refused to give up?" 




 Like, he wanted to prove to everyone that he could make a movie on his own and it was really just a foreshadowing of what the prequels would bring... 
























 Super Smash Brothers Drift (Kart Racing/Fighting game)

You would be able to play as all the characters from the most recent SSB game, with their own customizable racing karts.

The style of the game would be somewhat different than other racers like Mario Kart - you can choose to compete with 4 - 12 players on a variety of tracks. 

But here's the twist - there's no finish line - you are continually moving around the chosen track. The position of the players is determined by a damage meter/percentage, like that of the real SSB games. You can use a multitude of attacks on other players, including bumping into other karts, and launching projectiles. Items and power ups would be scattered around the track, and whomever has the least damage when the time limit is up wins the game.

This is just an idea I had and I would love to here your opinions. I'm working on some concept art for the game, which I'll post later. 









 On the Club Nintendo website it says that new rewards are coming January 19th. 

2 things:

When today will we be getting new rewards?

What rewards do you think they'll be?

Personally, I have a lot of points to spend, so I'm hoping for some good 3DS downloads... 




 Only 11 months from today!

When do you think we'll see a poster? 









 This is kind of a stupid theory, but I'll share it anyway:

As we all know, Nintendo's first few consoles were the NES, SNES, N64, and the Gamecube. Then, we had the Wii, followed by the Wii U. 

See any similarities yet? Well, it's a bit of a stretch, but both the NES and the Wii were succeeded by consoles that had the same name, with an extra letter added. This could be totally insignificant, but could the next console be the Nintendo 128 (or something along those lines) followed by the Nintendo Videosphere? Only time will tell...


TL;DR - theory about console naming

 Nice try Plankton. 




 A long, long time ago...

There are two directions this one could take 




 Even still, we shouldn't make the assumption that this is actually what goes down in the movie. For all we know, none of it could be true. 




 Yes 




 So a crossover with two movies that involve cars and crazy stunts with lots of action would be crazy? I don't see how that couldn't work other than the time period difference... 




 Was it ever NOT gonna be a good movie? 




 Could someone please link me to the episode or clip where Rich says "mopies" instead of movies? 




 I dunno, I thought this season was a big improvement over the last few. Did you see the finale last week? It was actually pretty good! 




 I gave someone a link to something I found through an easy Google search

 Oddjob! 




 Yeah, I'm secretly hoping the the SW7 DVD will have that same style of box art (even though it probably won't) 




 The haven't used a word like "rise" yet

I bet 

Star Wars Episode VIII: An Ancient Fear

And

Star Wars Episode IX: Dawn of the Republic or sumthin 




 "An Ancient Fear"

 What about Churchman: The Secret King?

 I doubt they'd call it that, they've already used the word "rogue"

 I disagree, at least with them being bad. The visual effects in the prequels were ahead of their time and they hold up pretty well today. 




 What?? 




 So you ask for people's interpretations, but then you say that their arguments are invalid, despite the fact that they are based on logic? 




 My two favorites will always be Bootleg Pokemon and Takeshi's Challenge. On the other hand, I'd have to say that his earliest stuff isn't very good.

Hope that's good enough! 




 Sure - I'll get right on it 









 I would think they save it for D23 




 That's possible 




 ow my back 









 Well, he was sorta the key to all of it, he was a funnier character than they've ever had 




 I thought that was also in The Clone Wars from 2003 




 7 months from today, Star Wars The Force Awakens will be released in theaters.

When do you think we'll see another poster or teaser? 




 Haha! Women in a movie! I thought that was so hilarious!

/s 




 Oh it definitely matters how good it is. Would you rather have 1 bad movie about and influential figure or 2 movies, one of which will be excellent? 




 Yeah, but this'll be good. 




 Who cares? I think they're funny and entertaining, it doesn't make a difference to me if they aren't actually legitimate film critics. 




 Exactly! 




 So you've seen every film in existence and know for a fact that he is the only man who's ever slowed down the frame rate of a shot? 




 Source? 




 So? Seriously, what is so revolutionary about that? Did he invent some new technology? Is he the first person to ever do this? 




 So I would be praised for revolutionizing the art of film by putting a couple of slow motion shots in my movie? I know that's simplifying what Miller did by a lot, but the principle still applies. 




 But the ability to express the characters in terms of audio and visuals is unique to filmmaking. It gives you a clearer picture of who someone is and what their motivations are. 




 More so than a movie like Star Wars? Jurassic Park? Even something like Birdman? 




 For you. 




 Seriously dude?? 




 Not really 




 Some guy with a broken leg watches other people out of his window 




 Pretty good! 









 I'm on it. 




 I guess so 




 Yeah, but he said it was *a lot* deeper 




 Yeah, but don't feel intimidated by it or anything. 




 Don't generalize all of our food when you see places like McDonalds or KFC - try to find some nice, local restaurants, as a lot of them are very good. 




 I've got an amazing cable access show and I still know how to party! 




 Well, he's still aging every year  




 You mean movies that you've seen this year? 




 What's so special about the frame rate/editing compared to any of the other big budget action movies? 




 Well, no offense, but don't talk about it like its some low-budget spiritual piece of filmmaking. Don't get me wrong, it was great, but there really wasn't *that* much there in terms of story or character development. 




 Exactly - it's not about how it was made, it's about what you see on the screen. If that doesn't stand out in any way, then there's no point. 




 ok I'll be quiet 




 It made 100 million dollars this weekend. Not exactly tanking. 




 Saw **The Bridge on the River Kwai** for the first time. Loved it. 

It almost felt like the precursor to Lawrence of Arabia, such a large-scale story told beautifully.

 Yeah, it all felt very over dramatic 




 Oh my gosh! I was wrong 




 Sorry, got confused 




 I disagree - I really don't think anyone could've done as good of an Alec Guiness impression 




 No, I think it was shot on Arri Alexa digital cameras 




 Honestly I think James Franco could play that role pretty well 




 Seriously, why wouldn't it? It's a big budget Hollywood movie based off an already existing franchise with big names as stars. It had a decently large advertising campaign, and it's been doing incredibly well with critics. 




 I've been starvin' 'em, tazin' 'em, singing off key... 




 Can I play the piano anymore? 




 The movie will also spread through the massive ad campaign. Trust me, you guys are talking about this like its a low budget indie movie based on a completely original idea. 




 Yup 




 Sounds like it could be cool - more of a "Close Encounters" approach 




 For example, I've always wanted to see what Stanley Kubrick could've done with Lord of the Rings, or even 1984.

What movies do you wish a director had made? 




 That is all. 




 On a Thursday? Not really. Wait till the weekend is over. 




 Yeah, but that doesn't really make much sense

 What did you use for it?

 Star Wars Sequel Trilogy - I *need* to know what happens! 




 Yeah, I watched The Godfather this week and it was utterly horrible compared to Kung Fury

Edit: (/uj) I actually forgot I was browsing /r/moviescirclejerk for a moment and I thought this was an actual /r/movies thread (/rj) 




 It's stupid to say something is unfairly judged by critics. That's why they are critics, is because they are qualified to be judging something. If the unanimous decision of the critics is that the movie is bad, then it might be true for a lot of people. 




 Alfred Molina IIRC - Satipo (Indiana Jones), Doc Ock, and some Prince of Persia character  




 Well, that's in terms of box office, not toy, book, and video game sales. 




 I have no idea why you would make a statement that's obviously going to provoke an argument. 




 So we're all neckbeards because we disagree with your opinion, which basically no one else has. 

Logic = A+ 




 I think the conversation was started in the mid-80s, with Gremlins and Temple of Doom. This was tame enough for the time, I guess. 




 Yeah, but not as good as Jaws, unfortunately 




 There was nothing groundbreaking or special about Avatar other than the special effects, which are now commonplace in today's movies. I can't see any Avatar sequels making anywhere near the amount of money that the first one made.

However, Star Wars may be the most popular and successful movie franchise of all time. Like you said, its appeal spans multiple generations all across the globe, and a sequel 10 years in the making is not something that no one cares about. 88 *million* was the number of views that second trailer had in *24 hours*. That's amazing. There is no doubt in my mind that its success will be equal to that of Avatar's. 




 Boring, art house, and foreign all sort of imply pretentious in the context you use it in... 




 http://imgur.com/HfO0EL3

Always loved this scene 




 Guaranteed 1 billion, likely 2, and if it's really really good, I can maybe see it passing Avatar as the highest grossing movie of all time. 




 *The Godfather* - not pretentious or foreign, it is just one of the best written and well told stories.

*Citizen Kane* - most of the cinematography, lighting, makeup, and storytelling techniques you see today? Citizen Kane invented those. 

*The Empire Strikes Back* - nothing pretentious there. Just a good, fun movie. 




 To be honest, there wasn't that much explicitly wrong with it. Sure, the acting was bland and it could be dull at times, but it did its job as a disaster movie. It had the right blend of characters and action. 




 I elaborated on my point. You answered the question saying everyone hates Star Wars when you like it, but that's objectively not true. 




 Well, not really unknown with a few million subs 




 That was Sjin! 




 Think about how much hype that created. No way to see it online easily, and there hadn't been a Star Wars movie in 16 years. 




 No, they're really not. No one hates Star Wars. It's one of the most universally adored and most popular franchises. 




 **The World is Not Enough**

C'mon. It's a cool spy action movie. What's not to love? 




 Well, technically it was produced in Britain with some of their money... So... 




 Eh, more like an SNL sketch, not a feature length movie 




 The Godfather 




 The Elephant Man

Spartacus

The Godfather Part III 




 It was filmed there.

What makes 2001 British? 




 He does use the same quality and techniques for effects 




 I would think that

Kylo Ren = Darth Vader

Snoke = The Emperor

Gleeson's character = Tarkin

Captain Phasma = Boba Fett  




 I would think OP means from the two teasers 




 I think they've confirmed that was pulled from the film - if anyone could back me up on that, that would be great 




 My friends and I played the most intense game of Clue ever. 




 MICHAEL! 




 It just goes to show that, no matter what you say about the quality of those movies, George Lucas new something about marketing 




 - Have seen movie
- Has read book

A few things that make the movie so great in my opinion:

Kubrick's direction

Nicholson's acting

Cinematography

Visuals

Suspense and fear

Though very different from the book, The Shining is a good film on its own 




 Wayne's World. Uh, excellent! 




 Written for the movie... So... 









 I would think "realistic looking computer graphics" fits better 




 Mad Marx: Commie Road

ayy lmao 




 Star Wars, 2001, Jurassic Park, Jaws 




 A few bad names =/= bad story, bad acting, bad directing, or bad visuals. Wait till the movie comes out. He won't ruin it. 




 The freakin' Cha-Cha Slide...

 I wouldn't say horrible quality, Apple does make quality designed hardware and software that works for most average people.

 No, but it would be a more gradual decline to insanity, and I think he can do the whole "intimidating but strangely calm" thing 




 I've always wondered how to see google searches from previous years, thanks! 




 That's why I think Harrison Ford could've worked well in that role 




 Me neither - I think it was only with the IMAX 3D version 




 It might be in IMAX theaters as well 




 Always wondered this. I know there were a countless number of times when Lucas said no, but were there ever rumors in the 2000s of another movie happening?  




 Star Wars - Episode 3: Divisions of the [Quagmire](http://imgur.com/YFRz1l3) 




 The Clone Wars seemed like it could be a title for one of them 




 Yeah, there's really not much about those that couldn't be canon 




 I have 3/5, Droids, Clone Wars Volume 1, and the Ewoks movie. Only the Clone Wars, and maybe Droids, are recommended. 




 I wondered if I should put it on, and I almost left it out, but there are some people out there who seem to like it... 




 Personally I love Last Crusade the best.

What do you think? 




 I honestly don't know how I feel. There were as many good moments for me as there were bad. Firstly, I loved the style overall. It had a very Disney-ish feel to it, which helped to bring a sense of wonder and adventure to it. On the other hand, it was probably one of the most cliche movies I've ever seen, and the dialogue was not anything to be proud of. 




  That's another small step for man, an even greater leap for mankind 




 The Bridge on the River Kwai 




 Haha - I think people are on to you 




 There has never been a time where reading/hearing/seeing Karl hasn't made me laugh out loud 




 Inspired by /u/JG1991's question 




 Yeah, I actually think it's the closest in style and tone to the OT 




 Or the multiple of 2? 




 Then I don't think you understand what makes Star Wars so good and successful. It's a timeless story with relatable characters, something that a lot of movies in the 70s didn't have. Without it's special effects and wide appeal, we wouldn't have any of the blockbuster movies today.  




 C'mon dude! 




 Yeah, I've never understood why that would make it look any better  




 I agree with you on everything except George Miller emulating the style of Buster Keaton. Not in the slightest. Action-comedy is not what I'd call Mad Max. 




 Life, um, finds a way... 




 I think it would be *interesting* (not necessarily good) to see a sequel where all the classic animated characters are struggling in a world where CGI has taken over  




 Use a YouTube to MP3 downloader for the trailer and cut out that one line 




 So you'd rather pay extra for something you can accomplish in an easier way? 




  Iron Man

Comic hero 




  James Bond

Book character 




 Not OP, but I thought it was nothing but a typical action movie. Very little was there in terms of story or dialogue. 




 And it was really only Lucas himself that he saw potential in, not necessarily the movie. 




 :/ 




 I'm sure they would if a popular/critically acclaimed director were to do it - someone like Spielberg or Nolan (not to be circlejerky or anything) 




 Personally, I think those movies have lots of redeeming qualities. Special effects are nice, the whole "world building" is cool, Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson give good performances, and it was interesting to see what was going on in the Star Wars universe before the OT. 




 It already sort of is, and it's only been out for a little more than a week - I don't think there's anything to worry about  




 See:

Conquest of the Planet of the Apes 




 "Sorry, meant to say that" 




 "Yes" 




 Well, you can't call something overrated just because there's parts about it that you don't like... 




 "I really hate the fact that you made me waste the time typing letters into a search engine so I could figure out what you were talking about. I could've used that time to do a lot of other things. I appreciate your comment, but FYI, please try not to ruin my day again."

 No 




 Nope

 Here's 5:

1) ...
2) Planet of the Apes
3) Back to the Future
4) Jurassic Park
5) Jaws 




 Yeah, I figured, but you said *a* Bush, and not just Bush 




 Well, no matter what you say, it has undeniably had a humongous impact on popular culture and filmmaking as a whole. 




 They are still quality pieces of hardware and software
