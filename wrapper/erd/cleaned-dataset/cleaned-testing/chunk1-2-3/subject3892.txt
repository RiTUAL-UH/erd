 The Hobbit. Every one of my friends loved it growing up. Insisted I should read it before diving into the LOTR trilogy. I couldn't stand all of the singing dwarves and poems and nonsense of the like. 

Suffice it to say I've never read any of the LOTR books despite being a fantasy/sci-fi fan. I can appreciate them for what they've done for the genre as a whole, but I cannot stand them on a personal level.  




 I'm with you on this one. Dare I say I liked the movie more? 




 Nailed it.  




 I regrettably started this, put it down about 100 pages in, and never picked it up again. Me thinks I have to start fresh again.  




 I feel like this may be a Stephen King novel, if only because he uses that "dear reader" phrase from time to time. Maybe even a piece of the Dark Tower series? 




 The Hegemony Consul sat on the balcony of his ebony spaceship and played Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp Minor on an ancient but well-maintained Steinway while great, green, saurian things surged and bellowed in the swamps below.  




 And yes, that field goal was with only two seconds remaining. 









 First off, I won't even pretend I know what it's like to be deployed or serve in combat, so I'm sure this book hit you differently than it did me. But here's my story:

A company I used to work for had a book drive two days before I left for a business trip, a 14-dayer in the middle of Mexico. Minutes before a company bus was prepared to take us to the airport I noticed my kindle was dead AND I didn't bring the charger. I rushed to the boxes of books we had a drive for, promising to return them when I came back. One of those books I snagged was "A Farewell to Arms."

Now, again, I was never deployed overseas, but this was the longest amount of time I was spending away from my family and friends. The way he describes all of those points you mention - attitude, demeanor, love - hit me in a way that left me thinking about home more than I would have liked. At the same time, a week or so into my trip, I found out a good friend of mine with a one-year-old boy had just learned that he had leukemia. Had I been stateside I would've been in the hospital room that day. But unfortunately the best I could do was get a calling card and call home to chat with her. There was something about the book that related to my reality, even if it wasn't a direct correlation. I too found myself thinking, "Man, life is short - sometimes too short, and we have to really appreciate the time we have with each other." The average person doesn't need a book to find that out, but it was a stark reminder no less.

Also, and I hope I'm not spoiling it for anyone, but I really thought this would be an exception to the Hemingway format. Which is to say, I didn't think anyone would die at the end. But then bam, with three pages left he drops a bomb on the reader. Not cool Ernie. Not. Cool. 

Still, what a fantastic read that sent me through an array of emotions at the time. 

(And for those wondering, my friend's son has since been in remission for three years and seems to be on the up and up for good.) 




 Can't say I've ever had much interest in anything he's written. The only book of his I remember reading is "Velocity," which I purchased in a bookstore during a significant layover in North Carolina. Read it in one sitting on the plane, and felt like the story was all over the place and didn't have all that great an ending. 

And on a side note, I'm happy you still have 40% of your intelligence left. I wish I could say the same - for a myriad of reasons. :-) 




 Yeah, it's been a while. Probably about 15 years since I've read it, so my memory is a bit shot. Doesn't change my stance of it being one of my favorites, but I just remember talking to a friend of mine about that scene and saying, "Do you think King channeled his younger self for that role?"  




 There may have even had something to do with his window. Maybe one of the vamps was outside of it? Argh.  




 Hard to remember exactly, but I remember it was later in the book. There was something to do with a kid who wore really thick glasses, played with models and model figurines, and maybe even liked horror movies and comic books. Man, I'm going to have to take a look again later tonight.  




 To be honest, my last few visits to the library have been for book sales. I think it's a win-win though: I get a bunch of books for less than $10, and the library benefits from a few extra bucks. I don't think I've taken a book out from a library in almost a year, although I do tend to visit them from time to time for a little solitude and peace of mind.  




 Yeah, I suppose I could've gone with one of the more modern "threats." I think Castro was in my head after having just read a story about his brother requesting a return of Gitmo and all those trade embargo talks. But thanks, glad you liked! 




 Try and work Salem's Lot into your to-read list. One of my favorites.  




 Wow, you managed to read more books by him in one year than I've managed to read in my lifetime. Kudos to you. 

11/22/63 has been sitting on my shelf for a while. I'm sure I'll attack it one day.  




 Man, tough question. I'll go with my Top 3, although I still haven't read everything he has to offer.

1. Salem's Lot - My all-time favorite, without a doubt. I enjoyed every bit of the characters, including the younger, nerdy kid later in the book who made only a small cameo but somehow struck me as King writing about his former, childhood self. Maybe it helped that I read it before all of the vampire craze from about five years ago. Then again, it's so much better than anything in the past decade or so that's been centered on vampires, so it will be hard for anything in that realm, or anything else by King, to dethrone this as my #1.

2. The Stand - I read the unedited, unabridged version, if only because King prefaced it by saying, "This is the way I meant it to be before editors hacked it up" (I'm paraphrasing, of course). At nearly 1200 pages, you can really get a feel for the parts that editors cut out, because they just stand (no pun intended) alone as this one-off bits. That said, still one of my favorite books by him, and I'm fairly certain I will one day read it again. 

3. Misery - I agree with one of the earlier comments about the imagery. King also did a great job of capturing the insanity of Annie Wilkes, famously played by Kathy Bates in the film rendition (which I also enjoyed), and the desperation of his protagonist whose name escapes me at the moment. 

All in all, I've read about a dozen of his books, which is to say only 1/3 of his collection. So take my recommendations with a grain of salt.  




 Fidel Castro's hand hovered over the red button, once encased inside a plastic cover to prevent any "accidental" attacks but now wide open to all deadly possibilities at the hands of Cuba's dictator. At this rate an attack was imminent, as one lone Cuban Missle Intern searched desperately for the one thing that could alter the tides of humanity.

"I swear to fucking God, if I don't get a bag of potato chips I'm going to blow something up." 

His staff of able-bodied assistants stood idly by, beads of sweat dripping from just below the rim of their green military caps. 

"Senor," said one of the assistants, "We have sent an intern out to find you potato chips. I assure you there is no need for this."

Castro eyed up his assistant, not recalling a single name as he scanned the young man facial features.

"I'm the one in charge, I say what is needed and what is not."

The assistant took a step back to realign himself with his cohorts, lucky to be alive for even making a mere suggestion. If anything the sheer fact that Castro's trigger hand hovered over the nuclear launch button may have been the only thing that saved him from immediate death. Not that he couldn't have the same result in a few minutes if that dumb shit Pedro failed to find potato chips.

An eerie silence hung over the room, broken only by the heavy breathing of Castro as he tried with no avail to unfuck his Chi. 

"You know, I do nice things, do I not?" he asked no one in particular. "I host fiestas, I partake in breakdancing competitions, I even clothe the homeless seconds after I take everything they have. Why must I look like the bad guy?"

With each man in attendance afraid to answer, the room remained silent.

"And now, here I am, hovering my hand over a big red button that could wipe out countless villages in Russia. Or South America. Or America. I haven't even decided on a target yet."

"Sir," one man spoke up. "No one has done anything to deserve. None of those countries has done a thing to us, or you for that matter. Think of the lives lost. Think of the children."

"Children? CHILDREN?"

"Oh shit," whispered one of the assistants.

"Children are the sole reason for my being here, right now, at this given time. Have you ever tried to get a minute of sleep in a house filled to the brim with screaming children? And then, when you can't sleep, find solace in something as simple as a bag of potato chips, only to find the diablos have eaten the entire lot, down to the very last one? HAVE YOU?!"

"No senor, I have not."

Castro took a deep breath. "It's very simple," he sighed. "Potato chips for me, no bomb is dropped. Muy simple."

Off in the distance the sound of slapping feet pounding the pavement drew closer. 

"It's Pedro!" screamed one of the assistants, equal part relieved and surprised that the dumbest of the crew managed to find a bag of potato chips in the middle of Guantanamo Bay.

Castro breathed a noticeable sigh of relief and began to slide his hand away from the red nuclear button.

"Pedro is here," panted Pedro. At that moment it was obvious to all in the room that he had once again dressed himself that morning, evident by the pants on his head, shirt around his waist, socks on his hands and scuba diving flippers on his feet. 

"Give them here!" screamed Castro, as he snatched the bag out of Pedro's hands and returned to his hovering stance over the nuclear button.

"See?" he said, breaking the tension with a small laugh. "Is OK now. Huh?"

The bag of chips crinkled under his grip as he tore open the top. 

"There is nothing to be worried about. Is OK. IS OK MY FRIENDS!"

He casually reached into the bag for his first chip. Instantly the look of anger returned to his face, the redness in his cheeks matched only by the red button. Before anyone in the room could notice the error of Pedro's ways, it was already too late.

"FUCKING RUFFLES!" he screamed, tossing the bag aside and slamming both hands down on the button. 




 Could it be that I'm strange?

Sitting here alone on a couch with delusions of grandeur dancing in my head?

Wondering if, when and how my dreams can become a reality,

Desperate to know if all is futile, whilst debating the every-day struggle of mixing passion with profession.

They say when you're strange, faces come out of the rain,

But in this cloud it would appear I'm the one begging to surface from the torrential downpour.

Am I to think a civilized sense of normalcy is the be all and end all to our lives?

To pursue the discomfort of the so-called comfort seized from waking up, working eight hours, commuting home and watching primetime television?

Why must the mold be built for us?

I aim to construct my own.  




 "...through the gate!"


That's about all I remember hearing at first, as I shook off the cobwebs and gathered enough strength to bring myself to my feet. Last I remember enemy forces were lining up outside the fortress walls as I took guard in the camouflaged bunker just outside the draw bridge. Had I had it my way, I wouldn't have been there at all. At the least maybe they could've paired me off with one of the other guards. Instead, they sent me, a narcoleptic armed guard, to stand watch for any impending attacks. Not the brightest of ideas, but then again, a lack of intelligence was the reason for my kingdom finding itself in this position in the first place.


Fully aware once again, I heard the guard bellow from the tower for a second time.


"All is lost!" he screamed. "The enemy is through the gate!"


Perhaps the enemy forces marched right past me, assuming I was dead. After all, not many people possess the ability to sleep through an attack. But they're not me, Sir Serons of the Kingdom of Peels. 


All around me enemy forces were charging forth to the soundtrack of clanking armors, barreling hooves and cheers of valor. I prayed they didn't see me peeping through the smallest of gaps in the bunker, had they even noticed it in the first place. 


What was I to do? Fighting was futile. Running just the same. Even the choice to rejoin my comrades would require a 
sprint to and through the gate, which at this point was entirely populated by the enemy. 


Still hazy from my unprovoked nap, I rested my back against the bunker wall. There wasn't much I could do. As one of the guards had confirmed already, all was lost. Nothing more to do but wait until the cover of darkness in an effort to make my mistake. 


Until then I'll just sit here, rest my head against the bunker and sl... 




 "OK, let's head up to the counter then."

"One second," he said. "I want to ask it a question." 

"OK kiddo. Go for it."

"Will Mommy buy this for me?" He shook the eight ball, flashing a huge grin across his face.

"You don't need a Magic 8 Ball to answer that one, Andy. Come on, let's pay for that and head home."

Unable to contain his excitement, Andy asked if I could take the toy out of the box for him so he could play with it on the way home. Sure, I thought. Why not? We could have a little fun with it. 

"Will I win a hundred dollars?" he asked.

"Maybe" replied the 8 Ball.

"Will Mommy win a hundred dollars?"

"Very doubtful," the 8 Ball said. We both got a good laugh at that one, after I read the word out to him, of course.

"Here, you try," Andy said, handing over the toy.

"OK. What to ask, what to ask. Will I get a new job?" 

"He never loved you."

I nearly choked on a lump in my throat. 

"What does it say Mommy?" Andy asked.

"Nothing. It says...nothing."

"You're lying!" he laughed. "Tell me!"

I couldnt believe what Id read. I even blinked a few extra times to make sure Id seen what was sitting right there in my own two hands.

"It says yes," I lied. 

"Ask another!" Andy insisted.

Suffice it to say, I didn't believe what I had just seen. "Impossible," I thought. "No way." Clearly even my mind was functioning with Magic 8 Ball-like responses to what I had just read from the toy.

"No, it's your turn," I said, offering to hand it back. But Andy insisted that since it said yes, I had to ask another question.

I stared blankly at the toy, almost afraid to ask again. 

"Come on Mom!" Andy said. "Ask it."

"OK!" I yelled, a bit harsher than I had planned. The fun of our banter had suddenly slipped away.

"Will...I...get a new car?"

"He's still with her" it replied.

By now tears had swelled in my eyes. The temptation to throw the toy was greater than ever, but my maternal instincts knew I couldn't show that side in front of my son. Especially since I couldn't even fathom the trauma he would have if I broke the first toy he'd ever purchased with his allowance money. I could see it now - on dates in high school or college, telling his girlfriend about the time his mom smashed his first toy. The therapy. The psychological trauma. The scars that wouldn't heal.

OK, I was getting a little carried away. I took a deep breath, slowed my breathing, and handed the toy back over to Andy.

"Why don't we put it away for a little while?" I suggested. "We can play more when we get home."

Slightly dejected, if not even a bit scared since I raised my voice, Andy was quick to do just that. 

"OK, Mom," he said. He looked like he was on the brink of tears.

How could a toy know? How could anyone even know? I hadn't seen him in years, ever since he stormed out the front door and left me seven months pregnant. "It's better this way," he yelled. "I won't hurt you any more."

Later that night I put Andy to bed and sat on the couch, racking my brain for answers and obsessing over a little eight dollar piece of plastic. Consider it a face off, if you will: me, sitting on the couch, picking at my cuticles (a nervous habit I cant kick), staring across at the Magic 8 Ball resting on my coffee table. Cue the cheesy spaghetti Western music. 

I wanted to, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. 

But, what if I asked it a question about...him? What if I faced the question head on? Clearly there was something wrong with this toy. All night long I'd looked over Andy's shoulder as he played with it, and through it all not a single answer came up that you wouldn't expect from the toy. "Ask Again Later," it would say. "Signs Point to Yes."

What if?

I drained the last sip of wine from my glass and reached for the toy, making sure to keep it in hand with the answer facing down. 

"OK," I said, taking a deep breathe. "Here we go."

"Will I ever fall in love again?" I asked, shaking the toy. I held my breath and flipped it over.

"Yes," it replied.

Wonderful, I thought. A standard response.

Again.

"Will I ever marry again?"

Outlook good."

Had I imagined those earlier responses? Was I suffering from heat stroke? Food poisoning? Anything?

"Will I win a hundred dollars?" What the heck, right?

"Reply Hazy, Try Again."

I tossed the toy back onto the table, equal parts disappointed and relieved. Maybe it was in my head. Maybe it was all just my imagination playing tricks on me. Whatever the case, it didn't change one thing: He was still out there, perhaps still in love with her, and I was on my couch with Andy sound asleep in the other room, knowing without a doubt that I was loved by a seven-year-old just as much as I loved him.

Some fortunes are hard to predict. 




 I've always made it a point to not spoil my kid. I never wanted to be the parent standing over my bratty child in the toy aisle seconds after he fell to the ground in a fit of hysteria begging for a toy. I operated under the simple assumption that if he sees a toy he'll want it, and if he wants it I'm not going to get it for him. It's not that I'm a jerk about it, but my parents instilled responsibility in me at an early age. I'm going to do the same with Andy, even if I have to operate under the tough love umbrella.

Truthfully, there's nothing worse than an entire room full of sad, past-their-prime toys. Maybe it doesn't resonate with a child, as they just as easily toss aside an "old" toy for a "new" one (loose terms, of course, considering "old" can be measured in sheer minutes). From where I come from, it's almost like I can see him growing too old right before my own eyes. Suddenly that monster truck he was so excited to open on Christmas morning two years ago is pushed to the corner under a pile of former, short-term toy affairs. The slinky, for example, that entertained him for about 20 seconds before he realized it didn't power up, turn on or propel itself across the room. Or the Furby, who so boldly stated that he loved him, seconds before his bulbous, glazed-over eyes closed for good behind the powerless batteries that were never replaced. A merciful death for something that irritated me beyond comprehension.

Andy's only seven year old, but that's just about the right time for him to start taking on some small chores around the house. Just last month I sat him down and told him what I had in mind. He didnt contest it, much to my surprise. His only response was, So if I clean things, youll pay me? Chalk it up as disbelief.

I started small at first. Clean up your room, make your bed, put the toys away after you're done playing with them - all small tasks that really begin to build a foundation for a work ethic that will ultimately carry him from one job to the next. Last night I asked Andy to take out the trash which, I must admit, was just about as comical as I thought it would be. For his sake, the walk down the driveway isn't a long one. And one day, if he inherits his father's genes, he'll be well over six feet. But as of right now, his small body can barely muster up the strength and dexterity needed to wheel the trash down to the curb. He tried and tried and likely wouldve kept trying had I not taken pity on him after witnessing his struggles through the front window, looking out over the driveway. Perhaps I was a bit overzealous. I may have to wait another few months after all. There's still plenty of time for him to grow up, and I'm in no rush to see it. 

Nevertheless, he showed a real interest in helping out, even if it does mean I peel off a few - very few - shekels in exchange for his services. 

When Andy asked if he could go to the toy store, I thought nothing of it. Of course, I thought. Let him reap the rewards of his efforts. 

So, down to the toy store we went, hand in hand, as I started to prepare myself for the possibility of Andy picking out a toy that was not in his ten dollar budget (eight dollars from chores, two dollars from the tooth fairy). How would he react? Could I resist the temptation of covering the difference if he chose an item out of his price range?

Rocky's Toys is a little shop in the center town, your typical "shop local" joint with its slightly higher prices and collection of toys that haven't moved off the shelves in decades. The novelty items are cute and all, but when was the last time you've seen a kid playing with a ball on a string? Or a yo-yo, for that matter? It's one of those stores that leaves you wondering how the owner barely covers rent, let alone earns a living.

Still, it's the closest toy store to home and the idea of taking Andy for a little walk narrowed down the options quickly.

"So, what are you going to get with your allowance money?" I asked.

"I don't know," Andy replied, a quizzical glance coming over his face. "I guess I'll just have to see."

"The weather's been nice lately. Maybe you can get a frisbee or a football or something that you can use outside."

"Maybe," he said. "Maybe I'll get LEGOs."

Red flag. For those who don't know, and by that I mean for those who don't have to do holiday shopping for kids, LEGOs may be quite possibly the single most expensive collection of plastic pieces I've ever come across in my life. I applaud the building and creative elements behind it, but the marketing ploy is simply demonic. Where else can a company recycle a bunch of old plastic bottles, mold them into shapes, slap a Batman logo on it and top it off with a sticker reading "$50" before they fly off the shelf? Maybe some kids' parents have that kind of money to spend, but as a single 
mother on a limited budget, I certainly do not. 

"Let's just take a look around," I said, hopefully steering him away from his idea. "You may find something you never thought you'd want."

We stepped in through the front door of Rocky's Toys, complete with the small-store jingling bell to signal our entrance. We were greeted shortly after by the owner himself, a small, aging old man who was hunched so far over his hands practically dangled at his shins. For some reason he'd always reminded me of Geppetto from Pinocchio, and even that stemmed from the days when I was a kid shopping in his store. Even then he was no worse for wear.

"Good morning, good morning," he said. It was common place for Gep...I mean, Rocky, to repeat himself from time to time. It was as if one response was for the customer, and the other was for him. 

Either that, or maybe his shop had an echo.

"Hello Rocky. Great to see you again."

"Great to see you too. Always good to see you. Always good." He barely looked up enough to make eye contact, but I took no offense to it. He hadn't been in tip-top shape for years. I didn't expect him to start doing backflips right then and there.

"What brings you in today? Birthday?"

Andy stepped right up to the plate, never too shy to talk to a friend. "No sir. I'm here to spend my allowance money." He proudly showed off his fist-full of singles, which he briskly withdrew from his pocket. In the fit of excitement he even dropped one, but was quick to snatch it up with his free hand.

"Ohhhh, I see," Rocky cried. "Well this is a big day for you. A very big day for you. Well, go ahead and look around. What's mine is yours.

Andy took off down the first aisle, past the dolls and dollhouses accessories, toward the back where Rocky kept his GI Joes and plastic soldiers.  

Despite not knowing what he wanted, Andy seemed dead set on going to his favorite section right away. Yet nothing seemed to really pique his interest right off the bat, and he quickly shifted toward the aisle where Rocky kept his puzzles, rubiks cubes, and things of that nature. 

Thankfully, all of those items would fall under Andy's budget. Unfortunately, I didn't expect him to come up with any of those in his hand. 

Andy's eyes darted from left to right, hunting for the perfect toy. Much to my surprise I saw him grab the occasional toy, glance at the price tag, and then move on. He was learning quickly, even if he was still learning his basic math.

As many parents know, take your eyes off your child for one second and anything can happen. Sure enough, as I glanced around the ceiling at hanging planes and UFOs, I heard Andy make his decision.

"I want THIS," he said, holding up a Magic 8 Ball. 

Truth be told, it's one of those toys you forget even exists. They're often times in large basins in the center of the big-box stores, collecting dust and waiting for that woman looking for a prank gift for her girlfriend, or the guy snatching up a last minute pick for his office Secret Santa. At no point does anyone ever say, "Gee, I'm struggling with this presentation right now. What would the Magic 8 Ball say?" Best case scenario it sits on a desk. Worst case scenario, and the most likely one, it winds up buried beneath other toys, going the way of the Furby, toy trucks and stuffed animals.

"Really?" I asked. "You want...that?"

"Yeah!" he said. "Bobby has one of these and we played with it during his birthday party. It's so funny!"

I wasn't about ready to shoot down his dreams, but I also failed to see the humor in messages that said "Maybe" or "Ask Again Later." Then again, the childhood joy in a toy like that wasn't necessarily in the answer, but in the question being asked. I could only begin to imagine what kind of questions two seven year old boys ask the 8 Ball universe.

"OK. Well, if that's what you want..."

Andy eyed up the price tag and smiled. "It's eight dollars and five," he said.

"Eight-fifty. Remember? The first number is the dollar amount, and the second number is the pennies. So, eight dollars, and then 50 pennies, or cents. Now, can you tell me how much money you'll have left after you buy it?"

"Ummmm...four?"

"Nope, you'll have one dollar and fifty cents."

"Awesome!" he exclaimed, clearly thrilled with the idea of earning and toy and keeping some money stashed away.

Rocky seemed enthused by the conversation between Andy and I. I couldnt help but wonder if he started remembering all of the previous kids who came into his store buying Magic 8 Balls. The questions they asked. The thrill in their eyes. The hard-earned allowance money poorly spent. 




 "Hey Mom? Yeah it's me. Yeah, I made it. OK. See you soon."

Fin 
























 Not many meals slipped free of Gerards sweaty palms. His sausage-like fingers barely grasped food long enough before his yellowed teeth ground down the substance that only further added to the padding surrounding his innards.
In laymans terms, Gerard was fat. Ghastly overweight. A bubbling heap of gastric swelling asterisked by jelly rolls for arms, vats of bacon grease for legs and a cherry on top that left one wondering where the neck ended and the head began.
Yes, Gerard was a sight for sore eyes  in life. Now in death  or the suspended state of animation hanging somewhere between the grips of life and death  Gerards presence was no worse for wares. 

It happened innocently enough. Two weeks ago Gerard, or G, as he was commonly known to those close to him, was working the night shift at the security desk of the Center for Disease control in Atlanta. On one hand it made perfect sense: the CDC was fortified to the hilt, yet still someone had to remain on hand in the event an elevator shut down, emergency services had to be called or, simply, just to keep an eye on the janitorial staff. G, never one to sit for long in public without snoring as if he were sound asleep or sweating like a suspect in an interrogation room, was the obvious first choice the night shift. Out of sight, out of mind. Thats was the best way to utilize a man who tipped the scales at close to 350 pounds.

On this particular night, G sat uncomfortably in his chair  after all, outside of beanbags and moo moos, its certainly hard for a man of his stature to get comfortable anywhere else  racking up heap after heap of chicken bones as he watched reruns of Golden Girls. Each soda only added another exclamation point to an already devastating health report filled with warnings of high triglyceride counts, diabetic concerns and an array of heart conditions.

Blanche always did it for Gerard, and his greasy chicken-covered hands began to move south of the equator as he twisted his neck from side to side as a precautionary glance for any oncoming threats. Seeing none, G chuckled to himself knowing full well only one thing would be coming tonight.

As his right hand rubbed the outside of his pants and gently stirred the sad excuse for a penis nestled deep, deep beneath his waist line, Gerards eyes remained locked on Blanche. Every cut to Sophia brought a hint of guilt, akin to that of a man with deeply-rooted grandma issues. But the slightest of jump cuts to Blanche got his genital neurons roaring again. Thank you for being a friend, Blanche. Thank you indeed.

All the while as Gs hand continues to awaken the overweight dragon below, Larry, the CDCs Master of Janitorial Arts waited for the perfect time to slip out of the shadows and walk his way past the front desk. In his pocket was the vile of Virus H1-93-D, his easy pay day and quick ticket out of the sordid South. From there all he would need to do was meet his buyer at the Greyhound station, make the exchange, and be well on his merry way. Hed played the scenario out in his head countless times, but now found himself playing and replaying to the soundtrack of a masturbating whale. 

Minutes later when Gerard was complete (Did he pull a muscle or orgasm?, thought Larry), the janitor waited for the security guard to make his way to the bathroom for a clean-up in aisle one. That time never came. In fact, G sat unfazed by his actions and merely returned to chomping on legs of greasy chicken and grunting in amusement at those wacky, seasoned southerners on the TV before him.

Shit, thought Larry. Shit. Shit. Shit.

It would have to be quick and casual.

Heyyyy G, Larry said with his long, drawn-out drawl. How you been man?

Unmoved by the janitors presence, G merely waved him off and said, You know, you cant surprise me Larry. You have more keys than a gatekeeper, and that gimpy leg only further blows your cover. If this were Dungeons and Dragons, youd have totally blown your D20 roll on Move Silently. Gerard laughed again, only to himself. No one else ever found Gerards jokes to be funny or, frankly, to make any sense.

Right man, Larry said, patting down his keys that up until moments ago were at the base of his wash bucket. Nothing gets past old G.

No way, no how, Gerard proclaimed.

Aight man, Larry said. Im done for the night. Gonna head home, squeeze one out and call it a night.

Gerard glanced eerily at Larry, wondering just how long it had been since erupting in his pants and having this conversation. Long enough, thought Gerard.

OK, he finally said, turning his attention back to the screen. Ill see ya.

Larry grabbed his bucket and headed toward the exit, adjacent to the storage closet where he kept his cleaning supplies. Already he could see the wads of cash, the cocktails on tropical beaches, surrounded by beautiful women in bikinis  no, topless!  reacting lavishly to his every beckon call. What he didnt see was the greasy puddle of bones and chicken sinew waiting in the center of the tiled floor like an unavoidable trap for a hungry animal in the wild.

Larry lost his balance on his good leg and, unable to adjust on his bad one (damn you high school football!), flopped straight onto his back losing all control and slamming hard onto the floor. As if in slow motion, the vile of H1-93-D flew from his pocket and landed in a smash of glass at the foot of Gerard. 

At first G failed to register the gravity of the situation, but by the time he reacted with his sloth-like reflexes, hitting the red quarantine button that would bring down the house, as he liked to say, Larry had already escaped through the front door. 

From the outside looking in, Larry watched as the heavy-plate steel curtains crashed in around the building, locking in G and anyone else unfortunate enough to be within the confines of the CDCs downtown offices. All of Larrys hopes and dreams were dashed right before his eyes. But given the power of the virus, he was lucky to escape with his life. That is, moments before he realized that in a fit of utter hysteria he had limped so far from the facilities that he was standing in the middle of the local truck route. To this day no one knows how he didnt hear the truck coming, but it was probably all for the better. When the authorities found him the virus had obviously taken hold, but the only part of his body still moving was a twitching finger and the toes at the end of his bum leg.

Gerard on the other hand was luckier. Or perhaps unluckier, as it may seem. He lived. Or maybe he died, only to live again. Whatever the case, his reaction to quarantine the building was the correct response in that sort of situation. On that front, his training had paid off, saving the lives of countless research scientists who proved to be more valuable to humanity than Gerard would ever be. On the other hand, G became the only specimen known to display the results of an H1-93-D infection, rendering him to the state of a circus animal amidst the crowd of bewildering analysts and doctors.

G, the man who was hardly a threat to anyone but himself, now remained no threat to those around him thanks to his own quick-thinking but slow-moving actions. Ever in a zombie-like state during the overnight shifts, it was now his absolute pleasure to no longer have to exert one more iota of energy. He merely sat in a pit surrounded by glass walls separating him from the scientists, merely existing on a diet of road kill and dog food. 
 




 Why is it people so easily forget about the serviceable aspect of technology when it inconveniences them? 









 Truthfully, I don't think they're even looking for money. It's a labor of love through and through. But they do have bins if you want to drop stuff off. 




 It's broken down by subject. When you first walk in its Sports, Sci Fi, and research books. Then there's a whole room for fiction and mysteries, along with a shelf of his personal picks. In the back section they have history, world history, tech books, and sciences. Don't hold me to that exact breakdown, but all in all it's about three rooms and probably 100-150 shelves full of free books. 




 Honestly outside of checking for hours and skimming the FAQs, I didn't go into the site much. However I heard someone walking the aisles telling her friend that it was started by a guy who ran a bar.

Just checked the website now that I'm back at my desk and came across this video. Didn't realize the guy stocking the shelves was the one who started it all:

(Also, guess I just answered my own question hah) 




 Cool. Good to hear. While I have your ear, do you have any idea about the back story to the place? How it started? How it functions? These are questions my girlfriend and I were wondering as we browsed the aisles.  




 Had the pleasure of spending Valentine's Day weekend in Baltimore and, per the usual, did a search for local bookstores. I came across this awesome place called "The Book Thing." I didn't realize why it was called that until I got there. You don't buy books. You don't even trade books. You literally just walk in, browse shelves and take whatever you want, as many as you want. I left with about 10 or so, ranging from Malcolm Gladwell, Stephen King, Le Carre and Michael Crichton.

Part of me felt obligated to at least hand some stuff over in exchange, so thankfully I had about a dozen books in the trunk I was looking to donate. It's not required, but as far as I'm concerned it's a small price to pay for what is essentially one of the coolest book THINGS I've ever seen.

Has anyone ever been?

 I love the simplicity of his voice, yet the complexity of his stories. I like feeling as if he's sitting there telling me the story every time he breaks off and puts things into layman's terms (for example, in Breakfast of Champions).

I sometimes wonder if authors like Vonnegut were successful because of the times they were writing in, not so much the topics they covered. Of course, he wrote his stuff in a post WWII world and took an anti-war stance on practically every subject, but I guess what I'm really asking is, would Vonnegut be as popular as he is if he released Slaughterhouse V today? I don't know if there's really an answer to that question. Just throwing it out there as a subtopic, I suppose. 

And as a side note, there's something that has ALWAYS bothered since Vonnegut passed away, starting with the exact day in which he passed. Quite possibly one of the greatest authors of the 20th century passed away two months after Anna Nicole Smith. While the courts were still going through the "who gets custody of her kids" story, Vonnegut was demoted to a mere side note in papers and news programs at the time. Meanwhile, a news story that was two months old remained above the fold.  




 As a Penguins fan it was actually my first impression as well. It can go either way I guess. As a teammate of Letang's, you have to see it as dirty though, hence the scuffle.  




 Can't be true...right? I mean, the dude was a monster and all but 22 pounds at birth?

 When's the next library sale? 




 100% agree with your statement about his fans. Probably the only thing worse than him. 




  Wasn't it intended for children?

Yup, I do believe so. Although writing for children in the 1930s/40s, if this book is any indication, seems to be a bit more cerebral.  




 Yeah, can't say I've heard of that one. Interesting.  




 As far as trilogies go, I really liked The Strain, although I was fairly disappointed with the last book. Anyone ever read em? 




 Funny you should say. I'm actually on the very first book of the series and can't wait to tackle the next (which consequently inspired this thread). 




 If "Women" and "Tales of Ordinary Madness" are any indication, then I'd have to go with a very firm "yes." It seems like he had a lot of self-confidence issues growing up, which has been mentioned in one of the previous comments in this thread. So in an effort to maybe cover up that universal truth, he masked it with degrading comments about women and fictitious sexual interactions with them. 

I often sometimes wonder if Bukowski would've been well-renowned in any other decade outside of the 70s.  




  What's your favorite trilogy or series of books? 




 Is this based purely off his works or for more personal reasons? 




 Well, that could explain why I couldn't find CS Lewis' comment then haha. Thank you 




 My favorite critic of Tolkien is CS Lewis. Apparently the two were friends, tied together in some way through Oxford I believe. Anyways, Lewis apparently once (jokingly?) bashed Tolkien when asked to read a passage from one of the LOTR books. I can't remember the exact quote, but it was somewhere along the lines of, "This isn't about singing dwarves again, is it?" I'm trying to dig it up on Google right now but I can't seem to find it. I always found some solace in the fact that even Tolkien's friend, and another famous writer in the genre, couldn't stand his works. 




 I've actually debated whether I should consider reading more than one at a time. At times I struggle with keeping interest in one that didn't exactly pique my interest, and find that I'd rather not read at all than subject myself to it. However, I've always maintained the one rule that no matter what I have to finish a book. So, the beat goes on, however long it may take to finish.  
























 Couldn't agree more with this. So many so-called authors out there try to use the ebook space as a quick-money scheme. Guys like JA Konrath pump out garbage left and right and take the full royalty from Amazon. I'd actually like to see now just how loyal that presumed fan base really is. It may hurt the writer, but it protects the reader as well. 

Of course, Amazon could also REFUND based on how much you don't read, but I guess that won't be happening.  




 Is it the re-published, un-edited version, or the one the publisher put on shelves before King decided to reprint them in the spirit in which they were intended?

Coming from someone who read the unedited, 1000+ page version, it's only slow because you can just tell which parts were left on the cutting room floor. But I do agree with the overall sentiment here - stick with it. It's definitely my favorite of his.  




 Well it's important to note it's purple. You know, because we don't need the color blind guy at the range complimenting OP on his nice "gray" bow.  




 I kind of wonder a lot of the things you ask as well whenever I think of Bukowski. Was he someone that generation could relate to better than ours? What exactly about his style has cemented it in the legacy of writing? And to that point, what style does he even fall under?

I never really found him to be funny. If anything, he portrayed himself as the heroic anti-hero. And by that I mean, he knew he was a horrible person but by virtue of embracing it and pretending to not care what people thing, he believed it ultimately made him cool in the eyes of the reader.

I've never read Ham on Rye, but I've read his Tales of Ordinary Madness and Women. Both were awful. To be honest, I feel one picked up where the other left off. And it doesn't even matter which order you read them in. They're all basically about the same thing: Misogyny, alcohol, drugs, sex, horse racing, fighting, more drugs, more women, more sex, a crappy car, cigarettes, bowel movements, more alcohol, sex again, the occasional note about writing something, alcohol, sleep, a hot bath, and the list goes on. 

I don't know why, but I keep trying to find something of his worth my time. I just can't seem to find THAT story yet. At this point, if the works I've read are any indication, I doubt I will.  




 Karim Mayfield is looking to hit the Chris Algieri lottery. Hope his acting skills are up to the task.  




 And therein lies the issue with magazines. Less people buy them, companies still feel the need to make em, so they jack up the price.  




 Hot off the grill in 8 - 10 minutes? Fast food isn't fast anymore.  




 No way he wants to fight GGG. No one wants to fight him, let alone a 42 YO retiree looking to make a return after seven years out of the game. Training or not, there's no way he gets back on the map soon enough, especially at a caliber high enough to face Golovkin. 




 Well OK then. Carry on.  




 Ay, go easy on him. It's not pink. Or even bright purple for that matter. I dig it, actually. Nice one, OP.  




 Not entirely sure if I should be insulted or not by your suggestion to take on something that is dumbed down... 




 To be honest, I don't think that was even an option on the Kindle I had at the time. And even if it was, my attempts at paperback proved futile as well.  




 OK, I know I'm taking a big risk saying this but, Game of Thrones. The very first book. I tried it on the Kindle and determined halfway through that it would be best read as a paperback since it likely required a lot of flipping back and forth to remind myself who some of the characters are.

Then I tried reading it in paperback and similarly struggled. Just wayyy too many names, places...things. I tried, I failed, and I'm sure I'll try again at some point.  




 I agree with Eogris's comment below - Just embrace the chaos of it. The plot line is centered on insanity. It's not supposed to make sense to anyone (which is more or less what a Catch-22 is).  




 I'm with ya. Tried it twice over the span of three years. Just couldn't do it.  




 **Pirates Latitudes, Michael Crichton**

It's been sitting on my shelf for a while, so no better time than now. This is also my personal double shot of Crichton, as I just started and finished The Great Train Robbery last week.  




 I guess you could say Burroughs is a little dark and depressing in his style, right? I'm basing off only two books thiugh, but he comes from a different place. Sedaris finds the humor in the awful stuff and leaves you laughing at his unfortunate circumstances. He's a satirist in its purest form. 




 Yeahhhhh the cold calling thing was a bit annoying. Also, what luck to have plucked them out of the group of similar names so quickly, huh? I guess it is the job of a journalist and all, but the method and execution in the novel was poor, to say the least. 




 David Sedaris is literally the complete opposite of Burroughs. I'd recommend "Me Talk Pretty One Day" to start it off. You may easily find yourself laughing out loud in public though, so you've been warned. :-) 




 Wish I could answer your question, but while on the subject of Burroughs, I enjoyed Running with Scissors but found Dry to be a bit cliche at times. I guess it didn't help too that during the time in which I'd read his stuff I was also tagging off on David Sedaris' stuff. So really, the two couldn't be more opposite and I guess I was just drawn to the things that made me laugh a little bit more.  




 I just finished Sarah's Key last week and I've been meaning to ask fellow readers what they thought about it (assuming they've read it, of course).

I for one really enjoyed the parallel storylines throughout the first half of the book, but found myself pretty disappointed when that stopped abruptly and focused on the journalist's side. Then, with about 60 pages or so left in the book, I knew exactly where it was going (all the way up to the big "reveal") and immediately found myself begging for the end to come. I liken it to my reading of "A Farewell to Arms," whereby I knew "it" was coming and found myself outright mixed with vindications and guilt for being right with two pages remaining (vague? Perhaps. Just trying not to be spoilery). I guess I'm totally open to being wrong with my assumptions whenever I'm reading. 

OK - Sarah's Key. Thoughts? 




 Thanks so much. It was a lot of fun to write. 




 (A joint project between myself and Mr_Agucci)

Anne shut off the burner on the stove, placed the lid on top of the mashed potatoes and walked it to the dining room, oven mitts on of course. After opening the door with her back to the family, she spun around with the goods in hand, ready to finally sit down for another hearty Wilson Family Feast.

OK boys and girls, dinners served. Pray then eat. Will, its your turn to lead the prayers.

The family bowed their heads in respects around the table, as Will took center stage.

Good food, good meat, good God, lets eat.

William! Anne shouted, the insult of her sons actions lending a crack to her voice. You will say your prayers and you will say them correctly!

Sorry mom. Sometimes its hard to know what to say, but everyone knows a good prayer goes a long way.

Fed up with her sons actions, Anne turned to her husband, who mumbled a quick prayer and kicked off the evenings meal. 

Mom these potatoes really hit the spot, but have you ever seen the power of the Quick Chop? Will asked. 

Anne looked up from her plate. Im sorry butwhat?

Yeah, what are you going on about boy? his father asked.

Will, unresponsive to his parents comments, continued to chomp away at his dinner, unfazed by the awkwardness that began to hang over the table.
Unprompted, Will dropped his fork onto the table and began to sob uncontrollably.

Son, whats the matter? Anne asked.

I must admit I havent felt like myself, more like Im living the life of someone else.

I just dont get the rhyming, Sally, Wills older sister chimed in. 

Shush you, said Anne. Your brother is obviously distressed. She turned back to Will and nodded for him to continue.

I woke up this morning as the sun came in, wondering how my day would begin. It felt like any day but I cant recall, all I know is I didnt feel like myself at all.

Then whodidyou feel like? Anne asked.

Will paused and collected his thoughts, eyeing his family nervously as he continued. I know that this is going to sound silly, but I feel like my name once was Billy.

It is Billy, you idiot, his sister said. We just call you Will because Dad goes by the name of Bill.

Do NOT call your brother an idiot! their father shouted.

Whimpering in response to the scream, Auger, the familys black lab and Wills closest confidant, walked away with his head hung low, the smell of his urine stain permeating through the room. Concerned for his best friend  after all, he did name the awesome pup years ago  Will snapped into action. 

Powered by the air you breathe, activated by the water you and I drink. Its Mother Nature approved!

A pin could have dropped at the dinner table as every member of the Wilson family turned to face Will. 

Hey, at least it wasnt a rhyme this time, Sally said, before realizing the error of her own ways. Damn

What did you say, son? Bill said, all eyes on Will.

I love beautiful wood, dont you?

Well yeah, but

It takes the hard work out of yard work!

Oh God. No. No, please, Anne said, cupping her hand over her mouth in fear of the reality before her.

What is it honey? Bill asked.

Its

HI! Billy Mays here for Flies Away! Will erupted, filling the room with his suddenly-booming voice. 

As the family cringed in response, nearing hysteria and fighting the urge to flee, Wills eyes rolled into the back of his head, as a dizzying sense of balance overwhelmed him and sent him face first into his plate of mashed potatoes. 

Remember, he mumbled, face first in the mound of food. Nothing absorbs the shock quite like Impact Gels. 




 Funny to see the main image being Stephen King. The first book that came to mind before I even clicked the link was "Thinner," but I GUESS he gets a pass since he wrote that under his pen name.

Also, the "cameo" was just his characters suggesting a scenario was like "something out of a Stephen King novel."
