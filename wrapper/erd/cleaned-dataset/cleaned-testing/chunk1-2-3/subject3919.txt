 I have heard good and bad things about the two and I would like to know which game would be the zombie survival game, and I have played Arma 2 at a friends house; without DayZ and i didn't really like the war campaigns so that would not be a very big bonus for me. I have enough money for both but I don't think there is reasoning to by the 2 when the are relatively similar.

 WHAT THE FUCK IS A REDDIT 














 I have been doing WBTB and i would wake up and not be able to fall back asleep. Then I tried WILD I slept until 3 o'clock and woke up with my alarm, no matter how hard i tried i couldn't induce sleep paralysis so I tried to go back to bed it was about 3 hours until I finally fell asleep, And after I fell asleep, I had my first lucid dream. but it didn't feel real it felt like i was playing a video game. here is how it went down. I was walking through my house and my grand-mother came up to me and said "apple pie" I noticed that didn't make any sense and looked at my hands, I had 12 fingers, so i bit one and there was no pain just numbness. I jumped up and started to fly. I broke through a wall and into my back yard, I created a house to do "stuff" inside. (I will spare you the details.) but i lost the dream and kind of woke up but drifted back into the dream and tried to bring in a famous person (wink wink) but no luck I couldn't get any thing to join my dream world not cake, nor a gun, nor a skateboard. i started losing the dream again and decided to experience what it was like to wake up (the time before I didn't pay attention I was too focused on trying not to slip out of the dream) so every thing look like i slowly closed my eyes and i woke up and had some breakfast.

TL;DR- I need some other methods can i have a good description of one that preferably doesn't involve waking up at the middle of the night?
 
























 I like this method because it usually only takes a quick glance. Just when ever you do your reality checks look for the rim of your glasses. Due to the fact that you do not always wear your glasses if they are not there do a different reality check.

 Oh, hey wrestlefan! 




 just cobra plz 




 Could i possibly have that cobra also PSN:test_subject3919

 I dont need heads but ill dupe my inv PSN: test_subject3919 




 I already have a homing quasar, i need a LOBBED quasar, that's why i specified.

I think i ahve a friend on psn giving it to me so I'm pretty sure im good on that front. 




 sweet thx! 




 I need those for a good Invincible killing set-up. Just ask if you want a gun and I will give it to you if I have it, hell; I'll even dupe my whole inventory. PSN: test_subject3919

Edit: even a singularity w/ a low fuse time instead of the quasar will work, but preferably the quasar. 




 Thanks so much I didn't think of making a new lvl 1, don't know why but whatever. I found out you cannot trade it or drop it though so i can't give it with a second pad from my other lvl 50 axton who dose have it. 




 I just finished a playthrough to try and get all the legendary solo and before the warrior fight I sold everything I thought was garbage... including my loot relic. Is there any way to get it back?

 I use dual turrets with sheilds ad a distraction so i can keep my bee up 














 Ummmm, just so you know if you drop the head, dashboard or turn off the xbox. You keep it and they get it too, but make sure they pick it up first if they are in your game. :D that's waht duping is. 




 this post contradicts itself 



















 Day After Tomorrow GIF? 




 If you pair stuff up correctly like the bee and the sandhawk you can deal massive damage. I highly reccomend doing reaserch on legendary guns if you're into the game. 









 I'm assuming you mean DLC, and yeah, kinda short tho so be sure to take your time and not use any OP guns if you want it to last. 




 My dad was sitting at the table and I asked him if he would like some peanut butter on his toast. He replied "Yeah, put some of that green stuff on there!" We went to the eye doctor after breakfast.

 Jackenstine drops it. It's a e-tech smg with the red flair text saying "by the people, for the people" when you shoot it the bullets kind of teleport. I got rid of it because i ended up in this weird dupe-fest with a couple of guys. I'm just wondering if i should farm for it if it's any good.

 Dude, that's awesome im jelous! 




 all I have is a caustic infinity, shock infinity, rapid infinity, and purging infinity, and I have no heads. Is there any way you could just dupe them for me? (drop them on the ground and turn the PS3 off without saving so we both keep the guns). And even before that I could just dupe my entire inventory like I said. 




 I can just give them to you. 




 I can dupe you the siren, and do you have a sweet fibber or a sweet sandhawk? 




 I have quite a few legendarys, including all legendary class mods except gunzerker, and other random shit, just ask. 




 [I'm so mature!](http://rlv.zcache.ca/thats_what_she_said_print-r79acb1096c5a46319fa318817ec8fc1c_2sor_400.jpg)
 




 To be truthful I haven't gotten into multiplayer that much either so I'd be down to do that if I have time. 




 yeah just store stuff first. 




 I'm online now i just sent you a request
 




 Dude, I'll just dupe you everything lol! 




 I'm pretty sure this one's a mural, in Montreal they have tons of huge murals on roads and buildings. I've never seen this one before but i have seen lot's. I live in the neighboring province so I have taken a few trips over, but I really don't know. 




 I can dupe you my stuff too. 




 Add me, I can dupe you and you don't need to give me anything. 




 The Incredibles!!!!!! 




 After you get it, can you dupe it for me? 




 What are you on, if ps3 i can dupe you a electric infinity, and do you have a legendary commando class mod? 




 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand no one's gonna! 




 I don't think you fully understand how this meme works...... 




 [In regards to the 4th pic](http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/314/1/6/beautiful_squidward_by_archangel_twilight-d4fsfmm.jpg) 









 I thought even writers were considerd devs. Oh well! 




 Yeah, what trippySG said, and you'll want to have a good sheild like the bee or the Impaler

The bee is dropped from: Hunter Hellquest (easier to get, he's in the arid boneyards in that building up on posts right across from spawn, and you need to do a mission to unlock the ability to fight him)
The Impaler is dropped from: the warrior

Plus a good fire SMG will kick butt, if you do the maximum tip for moxie she'll give you one, I think. The damage is usually around 4000 and the fire rate is pretty high. 




 I'll Dupe you my hellfire or hornet, and maybe you could spot me a conference call? 
PSN: test_subject3919 




 I'll trade for; it I'm cool with trading: the bee, hellfire, hornet, longbow, rolling thunder, and the Impaler for that stupid gun I cannot get to fucking drop!

Im on PS3
User: test_subject3919 




 Can I trade a Hellfire or the longbow for a Conference call? 




 *slow clap 




 Did anyone get the the ad at the bottom with Stephen Harper giving a thumbs up that just fucking made the post 999999999299999% better! 




 yeah, I think that was the original intention for her character, but not everyone took the joke that way, and if you watch the YouTube channel "hey ash; whatch playin" Ashely Burch, voices that character and it makes it a lot more enjoyable because that is a damn good YouTube channel, also her brother on the channel was a borderlands dev!   




 I never play co-op on PS3 because I don't have any friends who also play on PS3, I just recently beat it and now I'm farming legendary weapons and i have like 6, so you don't need more that one, to have fun....... I'll just let myself out........

 It was really just an accident, I kinda gave up on lucid dreaming because I had some real life stuff to deal with, then never picked it back up.
_____________________________________________________________

So I was talking to a friend of mine from 5 years ago, after the conversation I walked into a high rise and took an elevator to what I think was my floor (the top pent house) went into the bathroom and brushed my teeth not paying attention to anything in the room caught in  thought about the conversation. I recalled the events of conversation noticing it was a dream. I followed the events up to where I was standing. i looked in the mirror and my hair was orange and i had lots of freckles ( I have no freckles and blond hair) I walked out of the bathroom into a room with a grand window. The a lady with a terrifying face burst through the door and rammed me out the window I managed to start fly and it lasted for what felt like 15 mins. I'm definatly going to keep try to lucid dream now! 




 God, I'm racking my brain so hard to try and remember what game this is! 




 YES YES FUCKING YESSSSSSSS

 I know it's run of the mill but I'm loving borderlands 2 so much right now or if your looking for something inexpensive, Borderlands 1 game of the year edition it comes with all dlc's and has tons of actual hours of gameplay then after you beat it, you can try to get all of the super awesome guns. Plus co-op and single player are perfectly balanced. 
























 1. I have problems sleeping face up and I can only sleep on my left side. Can I preform WILD on my side? Cause' in all the tutorials they are on their back.

2. What positions should I keep my jaw in?

3. What should be going through my head?

Please don't answer if you haven't successfully done WILD. I always seem to get answers from those people.

 YOU WALKED INTO THE WRONG NEIGHBORHOOD, MOTHERFUCKER! 




 *sigh* It's a reference to a video game....... 









 MY NIPPLES ARE AS HARD AS DIAMONDS, NOW I'M SO EXCITED! 




 Forget Skyrim, it's a great game and all that, but the real fun is in Oblivion and Morrowind. Skyrim's quests are all the same, "I lost my ring! Please go into the random fucking cave and get it for me. Watch out for draugrs!"
While the other gameS in the series are like, "I lost my ring! Please get it for me it's in the well! ....... Haha! now you're trapped! I can use you in my demonic ritual now! WAIT NO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING! NO, STOP EXPOSING ME AS A NECROMANCER!" 




 A old age of empires-like game called Black and White 2 is awesome, you can be a evil god to your cities or a good god, you get to control the world with this big hand and it changes as you become evil or good, also the wars in the game are cool too because you can do things like throw rocks at the other armies.

Any fable game would also be a good choice, it's an RPG where you make choices that make yourself good or evil, your weapons, armour and spells depend on your good and evil traits too. You can do things like marry someone, have kids, THEN BRUTALLY MURDER THEM :D!

Lastly Just Cause 2, short description, fuck the storyline, go be a terrorist on the huge sandbox map you have to explore. You can do things like, steal a car, cover it in C4 drive it off a bridge, land on a speed boat, jump out of the car, grapple hook onto a chopper, throw out the pilot, shoot the C4 with a missle and watch the whole thing go up in flames. Plus being on PC you can mod the game and do things like give yourself unlimited ammo and invincibility!  




 Dishonored is a completely different game mechanic but it has that great sneaky-peeky feel to it, also Hitman: Absolution has a similar mechanic and it has a lot of options as far as how you can complete the mission, lots of cool kills in that game. 




 I'm super extrovert, but I'm not triggered by speaking just sounds. 









 Oh it was a apple product? Good, it got what it had coming.

 I agree with all of the games he just stated, also "army of two" isn't fps but the co-op is very good.

I also think Dead Island is amazing, lot's of fun

PS: Killzone 3 is co-op, source: http://www.co-optimus.com/review/703/page/1/killzone-3-co-op-review.html 




 When I came into elementary school, everyone was mean to each other, it was a toddler popularity battle. So when I got to middle school, most everyone put that behind them. I didn't. I was a ass to one kid for about 1.5 years then I had a teacher who kind of became my mentor. He never knew I was a bully, But he taught me human values. I stopped being mean to him and we were kind of acquaintances. The next year in high school I said I was deeply sorry and that I knew there was no way I could fully make it up to him. He did forgive me though. After that I became SUPER sensitive to any form of bully, no to me though, to other people. I stood up for people as much as possible. Not sure if this helps, or even if this will be seen, but best description I have is ALOT of self resentment and guilt that the bully doesn't know how to deal with. 




 Half Life 3 




 That's skull kid, not majora, majora is the name of the mask. Awesome drawing anyways keep it up.

 So, if I wanted to get the cooling system later that would be all good? Also I was wondering about this PC's performance with a over the top game like crysis 3, I don't think I'm even gonna play Crysis 3, but I was just curious.

Thanks so much for the help! 




 I could go a little bit higher on the price too (530$ish) is there anything more you would recomend adding? 




 Cool I'm going to send this build to a close friend and see what he says. Thanks so much! 




 Waht reasons would I need to overclock for? 




 Thanks for all the help. :D 




 I'm sorry if I have done this wrong, if so please tell me and I will edit the post, or delete it if it needs fixing.

I'm looking to play on a BF3 graphics (high to medium) level; but I don't know what that looks like. I don't have a very large budget but I can afford this one (max about 530$ish).

I already have a copy of win7 so that's no on there for that reason. If I did this completely wrong, or there is a different better/ inexspensive part, please, do tell. Thanks for the help. :)

edit: spelling

Holy shit this sub is amazing! 




 Um, I don't need that lol. I need heads. 




 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJUhlRoBL8M
 




 Holy fucking shit, I shit you not mine too. (minus the fact I had diarreah instead of having a nice shit) 




 "I'm going to make a video about my opinion, but I'm gonna disable ratings and comments so people can't post their ideas!" 




 SNIPING! I don't know how they could expand on it, I guess just having cool places where you could do said sniping. 




 Just ask, I also have lots of cool uniques like, rex, cobra, multiple sandhawks, fibber ect. 




 I have just recently got all of the legendary guns on PS3, and I want to try out the other characters but I don't feel like leveling up 3 others. ( have Zer0 and Axton finished) So I tried to use gibbed save editor and had no luck. Error after error. There aren't any good tutorials on how to do it for PS3 so I would love if someone could explain it in full detail. 




 I have you added James, I'm test_subject3919 and if you don't already have it i can dupe you 




 Dude it's a serious question, it's something he's afraid of. Just because you're annoyed by someone trying to get help on a sub where that's totally welcome doesn't mean you get to be a bully and talk about how cool you are, when you say "All I do is wait it and and boooom close your eyes and think of a dream or a mirror and ENTER IT" (or whatever the hell that gibberish means.) or how you "had a Dementor from Harry Potter suck my face when I was in bed. No fucks given. Get the hell over it."

You're not some all knowing lucid dreamer, you're a bully on reddit, and you're the shit that's wrecking this sub *and* reddit as a whole. You fucking snob.

 




 You don't need to specify that they are elemental, norfleet's are maliwan guns and therefor they will always be elemental. 




 Please if you post, follow the format! 




 I have it if youll give dupe me a non-elemental one. psn:test_subject3919 




 ...... Luigi? 




 I have all legendayrs (not heads though) 




 If I want to take a trip, and one of the three reasons for me to go is food (the others being music and nature). Would Iceland be a good choice? 




 [They're already here!](http://i.minus.com//imodkOMDqw6hq.gif) 




 I can help, are you fighting ultra ivicible or normal? psn: test_subject3919 




 I want there to be random legendary drops like in the first game, but you can also get Red Text legendarys like in the second. A bigger backpack would be nice too. 




 Well I did and I loved it. Not sure if that helps I don't have time to write a paragraph now but i would still reccomend it. 




 as a Jacob I decline this 




 You could use it to go to the future! Although, it might be faster to wait normaly.... 




 The worst for me being a diabetic is when i ask someone for like a single m m or something like that and I get the response "WILL U DIEEEE?????"
At least they care. 




 The vermi head for axton and I'll take anything else as far as legendary heads go 




 I'm pretty sure those don't exist. Could you still dupe me those legendary heads? 




 I have a sapping, I'm assuming your using it for pyro pete; It works like a charm! 




 Yeah, I'm a legendary fanatic and I have been getting all lvl 50s in my farming! 




 [TURN DAT FROWN UPSIDE DOWN](http://imgur.com/fz1tWeg) 




 Want 'em all? just add me: test_subject3919 




 Sure I can help, I also have almost every legendary in the game. We could kill pyro pete if you have the dlc, It would go faster with the evil smasher glitch if you don't care that i use that or not, also you should get the relic from moxi that gives bonus xp PSN:test_subject3919 




 I had tons of fun beating the campaign solo, it can be done it's a little bit harder than co-op and after you beat everything you can do what im doing now and collect all of the special guns. Plus with sub-reddits like [r/coopplay ](http://www.reddit.com/r/coopplay) and [r/borderlands](http://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands) you can get co-op players easy!
I completely recommend this game, it's my favorite. 




 Thanks for the offer but my friend already covered that 




 All of 'em 




 oh, lol.  I won't be on until later today 




 Just got that from a friend, do you need anything though? 




 I just got slayer mod for you and i have bolth of those sheilds, seriously name ANYTHING 

and I don't think you added me right I didn't get the request 




 * Step one: cover tack in tuna residue.
* Step numero duo: Take pics of cat grabbing the tac
* NUMBA THREE: Put treat in the shoe of choice
* fhheeeerrrr: Take pics of cat grabbing treat where you cannot see the treat
* feyeve: Put tac in identica shoe and photograph that shit
* sex: ???????
* sehverrn: PROFFIT $$$$ 




 I have all but slag hawks do you have: bouncing Bonnie, nasty surprise, and I would like legendary heads if you could give them to me preferably zer0 or axton heads! PSN: test_subject3919 




 Why not legendary hunter. Like I said I have all of the legendarys except those! 




 PSN: test_subject3919 

want:
transformer,
bouncing Bonnie,
nasty surprise,
and I would like legendary heads if you could give them to me preferably zer0 or axton heads!

I don't have the badaboom, but I DON'T want it because I would like to get the last legendary for myself.

Almost all of my guns are lvl 50 except striker is 48 and neogenator and blackhole are 49s I also have sandhawks, evil smasher and fibber 




 PERLECENT GOD DAMNIT! 




 DON'T DISS THE ORANGE!!!
