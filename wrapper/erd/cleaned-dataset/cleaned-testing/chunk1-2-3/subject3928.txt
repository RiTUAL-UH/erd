 I'm about to crush some childhoods, but R.L. Stein had a large army of ghostwriters doing about 80% of his work. My mom was one of them. She wrote two books and a few short stories. He's cool and all, but it's the franchise that's even cooler.

 I took this image from reddit a few months back. I'd really love to know who drew it!  




 "Sometimes you have to peel your own banana." 

It's from a kid's book of African short stories my mom used to read to my brother and I. Since then, it's become sort of a family montra.
