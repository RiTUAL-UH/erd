 When I was a kid, My family (consisting of my mom, dad, twin sister and myself at the time) lived in the country and so we lived in a couple of old farm houses over the course of about 18 years. 

The last house we lived in sticks with me though. Not only was there a ghost dog in it (you could hear the sound of a dogs claws clicking on the hardwood floor and the sound of a dogs tail hitting the corner of the doorways as it wagged it's tail) But there were lots of rumors floating around about the woods we lived around. 

As you can imagine, being the only two kids, my twin sister and I were little Hellions.(the oldest of our two younger brothers wasn't born until we were 4. 

Anyway, so because we lived in the country, we were pretty much allowed to do whatever we wanted, so long as we took our whistles (this was back before cellphones were a thing) and so long as we were back before dark. 

Fast forward to being about 10 years old, My sister and I had some friends over for the weekend, my sisters friend Jade and her brother Andy and a girl called Silvette.  Being 10 (and it also being close to Halloween at the time) we all decided it would be a good idea to walk around the woods just as sunset was coming. Y'know, freak ourselves out every time we heard an owl or heard a fox bark. Silvette was a total city girl, so it was a lot of fun to freak her out (my dad and her dad worked together and her parents and my parents would get together to hang out)

Anyhoo, I remember us walking through the woods, we'd gone pretty far, when all of a sudden, Silvette says "Hey guys, let's go check out that spooky old house" 

I think all of the rest of us said "What house?". 

You see, we'd found ourselves on the treeline of this field that was behind our property. Silvette points ahead and goes, pretty persistantly "THAT house"

The rest of us look (I remember this beyond anything to this day) there was no house. 

Silvette gets mad, thinking we're picking on the city girl again and storms back into the woods towards out house. So to keep her from getting lost, we follow her back. 

Later on that week, my sister and I went back through the woods to the field we'd found, and there was indeed a house, but it had been burned to the ground at some point and was just a pile of ash and broken glass.  




 The old farmhouse I lived in as a child had a ghost dog in it, It was several years before we actually got a dog and occasionally, you could hear the sound of a dogs claws clicking on the hardwood floor in the hallway upstairs. Every once in a while, you could also hear a slight thumping sound (which as I found out after we had a living dog) sounded like a dogs tail thumping the corner of the doorway as it wags it's tail. I was pretty young, but I can still remember those moments.  




 They're just playing, that's how they learn, that's also why it's *never* a good idea to give kittens away at 5-6 weeks old. between the ages of 5-9 weeks, they learn bite inhibition, they learn how rough they can and can't be. 
























 Completely unrelated, but he reminded me of what my grandpa used to say. He was born and raised out West. 

"On windy nights, listen to the wind, if you hear the door rattle more than twice in a row, don't get up, don't speak and whatever you do, don't check outside, because thems the dead, tryin' to trick you and once you let them in, they never leave, and not all of em is nice" 




 Yeah, this isn't as gruesome as the title says. 

I was talking to my sister earlier and we were remembering some of the stuff from when my grandma was alive. 

My grandma was born in 1936(she died two years ago) 

There was a story I remember her telling my sister and I once that goes something like this. 

When my grandma was a little girl, about 7 or so years old. Her dad found a scrawny little black dog. My grandmas dad according to her, was a big, tough guy that had a soft-spot for dogs, so he brought it home. 

My grandma said that this little dog was really weird, it just walked around looking at everything or sat there staring into space, didn't bark, didn't play, and it barely ate, so it always stayed skinny. She also said it stunk constantly, no matter how many times they bathed it. 

About a year after they found the dog, it got kicked by one of their horses (mind you she said this was a little terrier sized dog) Well, the dog simply got up, shrugged it off and walked away, when they checked the dog over, it had no broken bones at all. 

A couple of years later, her mom accidentally ran the dog over with her car and the dog "died" so her dad took the dog out into the woods and buried it in a shallow grave and put a couple heavy branches over the grave so nothing could dig the dog up. 

Two days later, they came home from church to find the dog sitting on their porch, covered in dirt but otherwise perfectly fine but after that, continued to stink like rotten meat, she said. 

It got so bad that they had to keep the dog tied up outside. 

The dog got attacked by a coyote and had it's eye punctured and one of it's ears ripped off. It acted like it didn't even phase it. 

My grandma said that this little dog lived well into her young adult years (from the time she was about 7 to the time she was 20 or 21

During that time,  she said the dog had been shot twice, ran over again, kicked by two more horses and quilled by a porcupine. 

It survived each event as if nothing happened. 

She said the dog ran off when she moved out of her parents house and she never saw it again. 

Edited for a couple spelling oopsies*** 




 I'm actually not entirely sure about that. I know Slenderymans started out as a croopypooster. But I can, to this day, remember having a dream when I was younger, It was one of those realistic dreams, of walking past the steps which led downstairs of my old house, at the bottom of the stairs, there was a bathroom to the right. In the dream, I remember looking down and seeing a tall, white skinned figure with no face staring up at me. It scared me so much that I woke up bawling. 

A friend of mine told me several years later, that he had had the exact same dream while staying over at the house one weekend. I had never told him about my dream.

and this was many, many years before Slenderman even became a thing.  
























 Dude....

I get it....She said "I think I'm done now" because she was done killing o-o.

People like that fascinate me. I mean, what in the world possesses them to do something like that? What was so traumatic or heartbreaking in their lifetime that they felt the need to kill? 

I've been pretty broken before, I've been downright pissed at people who'd hurt me, but I never wished them dead, nor would I ever attempt to kill them.  




 She never said whether it ever actually died or not. 

But she did say that her mother claimed to see it several more times, standing in their yard years after it ran off,just standing there, staring into the window, only to go and get my grandmas dad and find that the dog was gone.  




 Can you imagine waking up and realizing you're not asleep anymore? =O

Happened to me this morning. and Yesterday and pretty much every day since the day I was born =(
