 Hey everyone, instead of *just* downvoting a post could you please add a comment as to why? Maybe it's not that healthy, maybe it's not that cheap. Give us some context! Only you can improve quality and that starts with not just a downvote, but a reason as well. I'd like to know how to improve the subreddit.

 Hello,

I just switched from an iPhone 4 to an iPhone 5 a couple of days ago. I've been having issues logging into the app. I have cleared the login sharing and cache, deleted my account and then re added it with no luck. I've even tried uninstalling then reinstalling the app. Any ideas?

 So I bought a couple of bags of fresh cranberries at the market yesterday. I get home, pop some in my mouth and almost hurled at the taste of the wretched things. They were so tart! I had no idea! 

Anyhow, I want to make something healthy with them (low in carbs) and was looking for some recipes. 

Thank you in advance. 




 Everytime I buy a certain cheese flavored chip, I am always curious as to the addition of MSG. I know it's supposed to make food taste better but I've never had that chip without it. 

Same goes for any product you've tried that was MSG free.  














 Look, I've tried donotcall.gov, I've tried being nice and telling them to please remove my number from their list. But they're adapting... Like this:

I'll get calls from numbers all over the country, when I pick up they hang up on me. I would ignore them but if I don't pick up they'll call me 4-5 times a day. Just yesterday I picked up and didn't say anything and I could hear a guy speaking Farsi. As soon as I said hello he hung up on me. If I call them back then it'll take me to a rep and when I ask them to remove me from their list they just hang up on me. 

I would love to scare the shit out of them or take legal action. It kinda freaks me out when I answer and get hung up on. Can anyone help me?

**Now the problem:**    

Just recently (within the last week) I would turn my PC on and it would load to the login screen. After I entering the password it would load the desktop and after about 10 seconds my mouse would freeze, my keyboard would be unresponsive and then the video would cut out. Every now and then after doing this my PC would restart but would meet the same doom. **This is a list of the things I tried to fix it:**  


* Draining the power after the PSU is unplugged  
* Reseating the RAM  
* Reseating the GPU  
* Resetting the BIOS (by removing the little round battery)  
* [Following these directions to make sure I'm not a crazy person](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/261145-31-perform-steps-posting-post-boot-video-problems)  

Anyhow, it's a new build (been working fine for about 4 months). 








































































































 You people loved the shit out of "Let Nas Down" by J. Cole. I love that shit too. I love the shit out of it. But all be damned. I post a link to NAS' FUCKING RESPONSE and you look the other way? J COLE WAS INSPIRED BY NAS (you'd know that by listening to "Let Nas Down") because Nas is a lyrical master. When J. Cole made that first album and became a bubble gum rapper, NAS SAID "Hey man! What the fuck!? You're better than that shit dude."  

J. Cole was obviously upset that his idol criticized him so he poured his heart and soul into [Born Sinner](http://open.spotify.com/album/1NfrmcXk8xNennyxQ57JcW) and especially that one fucking song you people liked ([Let Nas Down](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLF39513uwM)).

Well guess the fuck what? Nas heard the damn song, took the beat and intro and made a fucking response out of it. JESUS CHRIST. IS THAT NOT THE MOST BADASS THING YOU'VE EVER FUCKING HEARD? I'm not going to spoil the damn song for you all. It's worth a listen. 

"But but... it's rap" -asshole 
"Shut the fuck up and open your damn mind fool" - me  

"But it's 3 minutes long." -asshole
"Are you fucking kidding me? You spend more than three minutes jerking off getting the same euphoria that this 3 minutes will bring your bitch ass." - me  

"But your words... they hurt my feelings." -asshole
"Grow the fuck up you little bitch. Life hurts. Cry a river, build a bridge, get the fuck over it and listen to the goddamn song or so help me I will find you and implant a goddamn chip into your head that loops 'Banana Phone' into your mind nonstop. The only thing that'll make it stop is you getting over your hypocritical mentality and listening to the goddamn song." - me


[LISTEN TO IT SHIT FUCK CHRIST CROSS BITCH NIGGA.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgcAPrmz4zg)  

And if you've already listened to it and are like "Dude, chill the fuck out. I loved that shit too." then good for you. Let's eat crumpets some time. 


Also, discuss your thoughts on both songs.

You know how it went on sale 2 days ago? Well this whole damn time I've owned the game I have just assumed I've had it. Until last night.

I play mulitplayer with some friends of mine and I try and join their game only to find out I don't actually have it and now it's $30 (a little ridiculous for a DLC if you ask me). If you have an extra copy from a bundle, i'd appreciate it.

I'll even draw something in mspaint for you if you comment (you don't have to give me the game for me to draw.) 




 One of you fine people posted a couple weeks ago about this site called usertesting.com.

I sign up and took a practice test (which paid out $10), got a 5 star rating and haven't really received a test since. I mean, you get screened for most of them (which, so far, has led me to 0 successes). 

Do you have any tips or tricks on getting new tests? I mean shit, I'd love the extra work but it is so damn picky. Should I just lie or something? I'd hate to do that. 




 Open to accounts older than 2 months.

To enter:

1. Comment with the game you'd like  
2. In mspaint, draw me your best interpretation of what the word "flargepool" is/means

 




 All I wanted was Crusader Kings 2 (can't beat the price, it's $24 on sale and humblebundle but $6.74 with the jumbo bundle)

* Deadlight
* The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing - Complete Pack
* Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition
* Terraria
* THE KING OF FIGHTERS XIII STEAM EDITION
* Legend of Grimrock
* Orcs Must Die! 2: Complete Pack
* PixelJunk Eden


RULES:   
1. I will only gift games to people that **have not received**.   
2. Your account **MUST** be at least 2 months old and have at least 35 comment karma (none of these sit-and-wait accounts)  
3. **DO NOT PM ME.**   

**To Enter:**  

You must comment with the game you want (1 game per user), your steam ID, and your best mspaint drawn interpretation of what it means to be a "cattyflanger"

Winners will be picked in 24 hours.


Edit: Guys, I fucked up. I'll be passing out the games still but I won't make it in my 24 hr period. For this error if you read this, edit your post with another game and I'll give out 2 per winner.

 Hello all, I hope I'm in the right place.  

My yard has a bad chigger problem. If any of us or our animals go out, we get eaten alive. I've been researching non-pesticidal ways to remove them from our yard and have come up with two safe tactics.

1. Nematodes
2. Sulfur  

My problem is, I'd like to rid them while spending the least amount of cash.  

Nematodes work well, I hear, but they are pretty expensive and require a special hose hookup to apply.  

Sulfur is cheap but I'm curious if it will affect my yard's ecosystem in a harmful way. I know it smells (that's not an issue for me) but would that smell keep birds away? What about bees? I'd hate to shoo bees away because of the chiggers. Would it negatively affect my dog?  

Any help would be appreciated.

 Hello everyone! I have an office birthday celebration this friday and the cuisine is "anything salad." I want to bring a keto-heavy salad but am not sure what would go well together. 

Could you help me out? It doesn't have to be limited to your typical leaf salads, keto variants of pasta salads, chicken/tuna salads would work as well.

 I walked into a bathroom and heard this weird noise coming from the stall next to the one I was entering. It was kind of like a small popping noise.

Anyhow, I sit down to take the browns to the superb owl. I pinch a couple of loaves and realize that there is no toilet paper in my stall. Shit! 

I didn't want to walk out with my ass covered in dookie so I asked the man in the stall next to me if he could spare some squares. He shuffles real quick and hands me a wadded up tp bunch with warm liquid on it.

I smelt it (you would too) and it was totes jizz.


TL;DR. Wiped my ass with a jizz soaked TP square.

 This is the second time I've tried it and I keep getting sick. I read about the keto flu but this isn't it. My tonsils have swollen up so bad that my throat is now the size of a quarter.

 At work we have [wall-mounted lock box](http://imgur.com/UEUElTj) where we store keys. It's always been open but yesterday I bumped up against it and closed it. Now it's locked shut and nobody knows the combination.

It's not your typical [multiple-dial lock](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Combination_discs.png), I've looked up youtube guides that tell people to look for markings under the turning dials and it doesn't have that. What I do see is [THIS](http://imgur.com/m3MtVjw). There is a flat surface on the cylinder below all three of the dials. I've tried lining them up facing me with no luck, I tried using the opposite number as well with no luck. I'm not even sure if that's the way I should be going in order to open it.

I need help opening this lock. Any help would be appreciated.

 Hello Gracious Community!

I've recently decided to acquire a road bike and I've got some helpful tips from users on where to find a great selection of used ones under $200 (120.53 pounds, 145.36 euro). Below is a list of links of bikes that I thought looked great. Do you mind giving your two cents on which one would be the best purchase or advice on what a good deal looks like?

Here are some specs as to my body type:

I'm 5ft 8in (172.72cm)  
I weigh 195lbs (88.4505kg)


Also, if you see one that's not worth the price listed, feel free to give me an amount and I'll ask the seller! 

I very much appreciate your assistance. Thank you for the support/help! 









 Hello community!

I have a low-end mountain bike. I bought it used for $25. The only big issue I have with it is the handlebar keeps coming loose! I've tried tightening the bolt and ended up stripping it. I have a new bolt and it's not working to well either. Do you have any recommendations on how to keep it secure? Maybe a trick? 

Also, where is the best place to find used sports bikes? Like the majority of the ones on the front page. I really like their design, the thinner wheels, and the two-placement handlebars. They also look like they're a little lighter than mine. But they're expensive new! 

Thank you so much for your help! 



















 I have quite a few mods I'm interested in using but once I install them (using KSP Mod Admin) and start the game, the loader will run until it hits the middle and then just stop.

Do not forget to provide your Steam ID. Please refrain from requesting if you have already received something from GoG. I know how disappointing it is to submit to countless offers and come up with  nothing, so I'd like to give only the underdogs a chance. 


EDIT FOR ALL:

User /u/lumenation has informed me of this info:

**If you have Sims 3 on steam and try to buy expansions from stores or from Origin, they will not pair with the Sims 3 on steam. Only expac's bought on steam will work with Sims 3.  

However you can use the steam Sims 3 key on origin and any expec's bought on steam with origin as well.
If you knew this or not I just thought I'd let you know so you can inform others. I had issues with this when I originally had Sims 3 on my steam.**

 I went to the doctor recently to get some blood work done. They said that my TSH was running high and that my thryroid isn't producing enough of the hormone. She wants me to start taking levothyroxine. However, I'm scared. What if there is an underlying cause of this occurrence? My family does not have a history of thyroid issues and I had blood work done last year with no thyroid issues (that I know of). I'm scared that if I start taking the supplement that if it's another issue that hasn't been diagnosed and is treatable, that I will eventually become dependant on the medication and my thyroid will stop producing hormones all together. Am I making sense? What can I do? 




 Am I correct in saying that she was once a man? I know that's probably a dumb question. She just looks so much like a woman! Except with a dick. Anyhow, I saw this presentation on shemales and how men get turned on by them. But gay men aren't. It's weird how our brains work. Something called an erotic illusion. Here's the talk: http://youtu.be/p-A8GvUehq4?t=21m35s. 




 I used to hate Yishan, until the thought police seized me. They beat me day in and day out. They deprived me of food, water, and shelter. They made me watch hours upon hours of reality TV (Jersey Shore, Teen Mom, and The Real Housewives of Atlanta) while crushing my ball-sack with a pair of vice grips. They inserted 2-4lb pineapples in most of my orifices and then forced me to eat the fruit. This went on for months.

That is... until Yishan saved me. He came and stopped the torment and he promised me that I would one day come to love him. 

Today is that day, my brothers. He is lov...

 Thanks! I overclocked it to 4.1Ghz but mulitplayer hasn't changed much. I think the highest I can clock it is 4.2, I might try that! 




 Yep! I just upped mine to 4.1ghz and the game is running better! 




 Can you recommend any MP servers that aren't shitty? 




 Well, maybe when I get a higher paying job I'll switch over to an Intel CPU and MOBO.

 Actually, I do have the ability to overclock it and it's water cooled so I believe it can happen!

I've had to turn the graphics down extremely low which makes the game very ugly! It's a beautiful game! I want to experience is in its glory.  

Anyhow, I've come to the conclusion that it's my GPU (Radeon 6870) and I'm looking to purchase a new one (can be a refurbished or used one). One that can handle Arma 3 at (hopefully) max settings. I also don't want to spend a fortune. I'd like to spend at max $240.  

What types of GPUs do you all use to run it at high settings? Any ideas or paths would be greatly appreciated.   


Also: I get rekt in every firefight I encounter, I can't turn fast enough...  




 I love that place! MT is awesome.

Unfortunately I moved to Dallas. I miss my curry. 




 Thanks smilebot. :) 




 Perhaps there is a difference but perhaps not. Everywhere else I've been has a much lighter panang curry, it doesn't look slow cooked from what I can tell. It's not that deep dark red. Makes me sad :(. I just purchased some panang curry paste off of amazon and I'm going to try and make your recipe when it comes in. Man, but nothing beats Madam Mam's panang curry. I could eat it every meal. 




 I wish it was that simple. 




 Awesome! Thank you for the explanation! 




 Lock-out? Tag-out?  




 I don't get it, the first comment in the first link tells you exactly why it might have been deleted.


Keep your conspiracies out of our undeletes.

That's why they are two different subreddits.  




 Oh, I misread your comment.

You were saying that if it's not a bacterial issue then don't give antibiotics.

I thought you said that we shouldn't give out antibiotics for bacterial infections. I was confused considering I am current suffering from an upper respiratory infection. 

Sorry about that. 




 Perhaps rule 0 like the last one?

It's not that funny.

Like 90% of /r/funny is rule 0 




 What about an upper respiratory infection?  




 Guns  healthcare

Makes 0 sense.

I hate this fucking state. 




 Semantics  




 Like every damn hour. Look at the top post on /r/TIL

So much hate on Islam by ignorant people.  




 You lie OP:

 My town sucks and the chain restaurant you speak of is in a shitty spot. I'm like a mile from their delivery zone. :( 




 It was actually taken from /r/jokes

 ALL THE GOOD SHIT IS GONE. Move along people.

 If it's dead does it still count as a tree? 




 St. Peter: hmmm, you lived a great life, you were always kind, you left a legacy, come on i... Wait a second... You once took a bite out of cold pizza... TO HELL WITH YOU SINNER. 




 Awesome! It's been so long since I've played that one and I hardly see anyone in this subreddit post anything but New Leaf. 




 Is the the Gamecube version!? 




 I get a craving for a triple steak stack and then proceed to cry when I realize they aren't in season

 Me too, I've known about this guy for 6 years. 




 I love it! I tried making my own but it just wasn't the same. 




 Re-re-reading "Stank ass kimchi" made me laugh louder than I should have.

 Careful... They'll send their *children* after u... 




 Yes? 




 He's just a troll. He lives off the displeasure of others.  




 I would, but it looks like my SS never actually sent a gift. This is the information I get when I put the tracking number in the USPS website: https://i.imgur.com/66g2yha.png 




 What do you do for fun? 

Also, are there any opportunities for liberal arts degree holders in the technologically focused market?  




 Unfortunately, packagetrackr is still telling me that it's in the same lake.

I've given up. There's always next year.

There can only be one.

 Ladies and gentlemen of this fine subreddit,

My office is having another holiday themed party on Friday and I'd love to bring a savory dish that is inspired by Halloween. 

Can I have a little creative help from you all?

Thank you! 














 CDC stands for the "Center for Disease Control" which has 9 vowels.   

Divide that by the number of letters in the acronym 'CDC': 3  

Number of people infected in Texas (so far): 3  

Number of continents affected by the virus: 3  

Number of dogs quarantined/euthanized because of virus: 2  

333 x 2 = 666  

Amount of people who have been killed in West Africa by the Virus? 4,439.  

4,439 / 666 = 6.66  

How many characters are in 666? 3  

How many Points in a the all seeing eye triangle? 3  

THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL IS CONFIRMED AS ILLUMINARTI.  

WAKE UP SHEEPLE.

 Or just a simple bread recipe. I plan on grilling some bratwurst this weekend and I'd really like an easy keto-friendly bun recipe. 

I have almond and coconut flower on deck.

Thank you a ton in advance!  



















 I have no idea where to begin. I thought taking this practice test provided [through the LSAC website](http://www.lsac.org/docs/default-source/jd-docs/sampleptjune.pdf) would be a good gauge on where I currently stand. 

So far I figured I suck at the logic games. 

I'd love to be able to score high by the December 8th test but I also know they have one in February too. Would it be better to wait until February?

I'm also not made of money and a lot of these tutoring sessions are half my monthly income. 

I've talked to a couple of friends I know who are in law school and they said that they had both taken courses. I think one did a private tutor (which cost him a shit load) and the other took a princeton review course (the lowest one being $1550 (3/4ths of my income)).

I've looked at the links provided on the sidebar and I hear the Blueprint is a decent service that's only under $900.
