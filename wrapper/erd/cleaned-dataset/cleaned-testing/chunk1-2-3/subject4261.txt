 Go find the best free games on steam and try playing through them. Or you could try reading a heavily involved book, such as War and Peace. 




 Rome- Seat of the Roman Empire, seat of the Papacy and center of ancient and medieval Europe.

London- Second city (after Rome) to reach one million people.

Jerusalem- The thousands of years of warfare and religious intrigue surrounding this ancient city are more than enough reason.

New York- A hub of international trade almost since the discovery of the New World, and currently the seat of the UN.

Athens- Less so for being an important city and more so for the scholars it produced, namely Aristotle, Plato and Socrates. 




 Contrary to other comments, I think the US might have a bit of a fresh outlook on world policy and internal issues such as states rights.
 




 A terrifying place filled with things like "stalls" and "feminine hygiene products". 




 Toy money at the dollar store. 




 No. We live in a man's world. 




 Running into one another hundreds of miles away after being separated for years and still finding that same spark. 




 Dishwashing; I'm currently in school for economics and I want to make the jump into the business world. 




 Arn: The Knight Templar 




 Blacking out at my own party and having a "friend" of my put his balls on my face. 




 Honestly, your best bet is probably to get and audio book or two. It makes the time fly. My personal recommendation, as far as audio books are concerned, would be World War Z due to its novel method of presentation. 




 An amazon box 




 Combos of course. They encompass every other food that's terrible for you (pizza, pepperoni, and cheddar) and wrap it up in either a pretzel or cracker. 




 I think it could because of the amazing story behind it. It's kind of hard to go wrong with such a firm footing. Even if it weren't what we are all expecting, people would change their expectations just because it's predecessors have left us with such indelible memories and the recollections of grand adventures. Particularly the opening scenes of HL2  









 It looks like the title on the subreddit is in that font so maybe you should ask one of the mods. Hope this helps. 




 Try playing a Nord Spell-sword (magic and melee). I thought it was rewarding.
 




 Roland Deschain, from Stephen King's Dark Tower series.
 




 It was really a war between bad guys.
 




 I, Robot revisited? 




 A Song of Ice and Fire total war would work pretty well too, but I doubt they would be able to get the rights.
 




 Honestly, if you want an emotional roller coaster ride and want an amazing story as well, read the "Dark Tower" series by Stephen King. Make sure you also find some room for "The Wind Through the Keyhole" too. 




 Maybe that's why GM is in such deep shit all the time.
 
























 You're right. I was just thinking in an economic context. Philadelphia was just so crucial in the development of the early US. 




 well... 




 Not to be that guy, but The Lord of the Rings. 




 Walrus. 




 Those stupid fucking Fred videos from years ago. 




 Holding eye contact. 




 Piano Man. 




 I kind of want to be that one golden horseman from Risk. 




 The best advice I've ever received from Reddit was when i was in serious trouble with my parents, reddit told me to just accept my punishment and tell the truth in light of the fact that I would probably laugh about it in years to come. 




 I don't know if this applies, but people see my red hair and automatically assume that I'm Irish. 




 Mad Men and The Borgias. 




 Well as a child currently punished, my parents took my car. This is becoming a pain for them because they now have to drive me everywhere. 




 Requiem for a Dream because of the highs and lows.

The Steward of Gondor, from The Lord of the Rings. In case you don't recall, this is the song that Pippin sings to Denethor while Faramir attacks Osgilliath.

Also the Rains of Castamere, from Game of Thrones. That just brings up so many terrible memories. I don't even want to talk about it. 




 "You've got the memory of a fuckin' fly" from the movie GlennGary Glen Ross. 




 His retirement. 




 Alcohol because while technically no one can stop you from drinking as much as you want, it will ruin your life in excess just like meth and other hard drugs. 




 9/11 WAS AN INSIDE JOB. ILLUMINATI AND BUSH GOT US. LOOSE CHANGE!!! 




 16:9 




 Middle Earth. Naturally the most cliche place to choose, but naturally also the only place to choose. 




 Every time that you form the diamond formation in Ghost Recon. When this happens, your team effectively walks right through what could be hundreds of enemies, protecting themselves only with overlapping fields of fire. 




 I wish I could say... 




 Yes because I would rather have it and not need it, than need it and not have it. Learned this from my dad, (State Trooper w/ 26 years on the force). 




 The gif of the panda bear riding on the subway train. That SOB just smiles and bobs his head. Never fails to make me smile.

Edit: link 
























 The UK was at war, at most, two years longer than the US. And regardless, the UK's infrastructure in regards to factories was A) bombed to shit, and B) not as large as the US's in the first place. It had nothing to do with who was where longer. It had to do with the fact that the US had the highest manufacturing ability in the world. 




 Everyone needs to see this. 




 Thanks. 




 Really, it's up to you. DLC for Total War games generally aren't make or break. It's all about the game experience you're looking for. 




 I agree 




 Darthmod is so good. 




 Yeah, it's so much more streamlined than Empire. 




 Empire is actually my favorite of the Total War series. I downloaded a mod called Minor Factions Revenge that allows me to play as minor factions. Venice is a lot of fun. 




 Blue. Definitely blue. 




 PLOT TWIST: nobody dies. 









 Napolean Total War (it's on sale on Steam for 3.74 USD) 




 Dark matter. 




 Blue of course, but only when multiplied by the magnetic effect of Saturn's Rings. 




 My license. I dropped it three days after I got it while I was at school and was too embarrassed to tell my parents. Three months later, coincidentally on the very same day that I got my car, my principal called me down and handed me my license saying that a janitor had turned it in. 




 I'm glad to see she'll go out with someone besides her brother. 




 I would upvote that. 




 Maybe but I was thinking more 58. 




 Mortician. 




 Eyes to the Wind by The War on Drugs. 




 Tyrion Lannister dies. 




 Yeah they still make them. I'm currently munching on a Pizzeria Pretzel one. 




 You're welcome!
