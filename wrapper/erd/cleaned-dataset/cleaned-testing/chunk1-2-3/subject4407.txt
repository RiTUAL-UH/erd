 Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds could be used to construct vital components for quantum computers. But hitherto it has been impossible to read optically written information from such systems electronically. Using a graphene layer, a team of scientists headed by Professor Alexander Holleitner of the Technische Universitt Mnchen (TUM) has now implemented just such a read unit. 



















 These materials are predicted to show a phenomenon called the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, and belong to a class of materials known as transition metal dichalcogenides, with layers a few atoms thick. QSH materials have the unusual property of being electrical insulators in the bulk of the material, yet highly conductive on their edges. This could potentially make them a suitable material for new kinds of quantum electronic devices. 









 Commonwealth Bank of Australia will get early access to developments made in this highly technical field, quantum computing.

 The use of UPC and EAN numbers has become so widespread that most retailers refuse to carry/sell a product without a UPC/EAN number. Most stores (online or otherwise) use whats called a POS (point of sale) system. Basically, this is the point or place where a purchasing transaction occurs and money is exchanged for a service or product. This generally occurs at the register or check out location.
