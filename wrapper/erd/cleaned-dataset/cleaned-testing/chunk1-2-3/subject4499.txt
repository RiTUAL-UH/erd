 I believe it was a 5 hour session if I remember correctly. I did go back for a 1 hour touch up after all the healing. 




 Here's mine. I basically just took the album that inspired me the most and went with something from it.

 Dude. That is also a very well done job. I really like it. Calgary Ocular Orifice tats all the way. 




 Haha definitely bumped into you. Was an awesome show. 




 Sweet dude, thanks! 




 I had posters I was guarding with my life so I stayed back and head banged my neck stiff. 





























 I simply would like to know in what order have the bands been playing. I am attending tomorrow nights show, and I really would like to catch the faceless. Between getting off work and putting my son to bed I know I'll be running a little late. Thanks in advance, I am so stoked for tomorrow. 







































 Personally I'd love to see Construct and Avalanche, so many great memories on both. Big Team CTF on Avalanche was always my favorite map and game type combination. Also getting those easy grav lift grenade to head shot kills on Construct was too much fun, I could have done that all day. 

What does everyone else think? 









































































































































































 [Needless to say, this is now mine](http://i.imgur.com/PdUl5uT.jpg)

Took sometime to clean it up, but worth it. 

























































































 [Blair posted this blurb today.](http://www.toolband.com/index_frames.html)


**FIRST "OPIATE" PRIZE WINNER?**

**It would appear that some lucky individual has won the first 'golden ticket' ("SEAL OF XATANITOS"), that was included in one of the first hundred or so 21st anniversary OPIATE CD packages that have been shipped out. From what I've been told, the winning 'seal' was inserted into the variation colored grayish-silver. Once I get all the details from Merch, I will post the name of the winner along with his or her photo.**


Looks like we'll find out what those seals are pretty soon.

EDIT: the greyish-silver is the [second variation](http://imgur.com/a/uSWpI) from what I can see. 







































 So I'm putting together a slideshow for my Mother's 75th birthday this year and I found an old picture that needs a little help. If anyone could help I'd really appreciate it, thanks reddit.

[http://i.imgur.com/EkFszJI.png](http://i.imgur.com/EkFszJI.png) 




 So I went to see one of my all time favorites tonight, Animals As Leaders, during their supporting show for Meshuggah here in Calgary, Alberta. Grabbed my tickets, got inside and got a beer. As the guy poured my beer he commented on what was supposed to be tonight's short concert. Asking why, he explained that Tosin of AAL tried to break up a fight in Boston between a cop and a rowdy concert goer, that turned out to be an obstruction of justice charge apparently. I couldn't fucking believe it.
So pissed I sold my tickets and left like a sulking baby. So heads up for anyone else anticipating an upcoming Animals As Leaders show in Canada.

**tl;dr** Animals As Leaders forbidden to travel internationally for the time being.

Edit: It was Javier Reyes, and not Tosin Abasi. Thanks Triangular_Desire. 




 "Hold On" was featured. Thought it was suiting. Thoughts? 














 So I'm looking for a picture of [Jamie Foxx](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aK8sF75Y5xE/UMYD0U80luI/AAAAAAAAK_Q/vFkeZOqDNis/s1600/jamie-foxx-surreal4real-charity-event-02.jpg) colored white (kind of like the Wayans brothers from the terrible movie [white chicks](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381707/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)) and dressed up as Dexter doing something [Dexter](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/09/09/dexter460.jpg) would do. Can anybody help? It doesn't have to include the pictures I've linked.

EDIT: I promise not to repost it to /r/dexter as my own work. I legitimately want to get my friend going.  









 THIS IS AMAZING AMIRITE? 






















































 AMIRITE? I MEAN ALL COMPLAINING ASIDE, THESE ARE THE BEST MAPS TO COME WITH HALO 4 MULTIPLAYER, BUT WHY THE FUCK DO THEY KEEP GETTING VOTED IN? 




 [Here's his picture](http://i.imgur.com/GT8qe.jpg), any and all suggestions/help would be appreciated. He's a buddy of mine, and these posters will have to go up at here at work so SFW would be best. Thanks so much Reddit! 









 I have zero Photoshop capabilities, so I thought I would reach out to the Reddit community for some help to make these pictures a little more hilarious than they already are. I know they are kind of blurry, sorry about that.

[Picture #1](http://i.imgur.com/kdyaX.jpg)
[Picture #2](http://i.imgur.com/xAPMb.jpg)

Any help would be greatly appreciated! 




 Does anyone have any that I can download? I know the search function for this is kind of hooped for the time being, but I'm aware that searching VIA gamer tags works. I'm looking for all and everything, especially Team Snipers. Any recommendations?  




 So I flew through Toronto to catch a Tool show on my way back from vacation in 2009. I was seated next to another dude flying solo at the show, he ended up taking a bunch of pictures, I asked him to email them to me and he came through, stand up fellow. [Thought I'd share.](http://imgur.com/a/sLvvN) 

It was your [standard 10000 Days setlist](http://toolnavy.com/showthread.php?t=114069). Also, [this](http://i.imgur.com/St1as.jpg) is the poster from the show, might be my favorite from the three I have.

Yeah some of them are blurry, but there are a few nice one's in there. Unfortunately this is the best resolution I have.

 














 Has anyone made the joke "it's been 10000 days since their last album" yet?  



















 Am I the only one that thinks halo 4 multiplayer is vastly similar the Call of Duty series? I was never a fan of those games for many reasons, 1) Unfair advantages among players due to tactical load outs 2) Point count for wins 3) Weapon markers 4) Ordinance. This game may look/play nice but it's so far from halo that I find myself quite turned off, I miss that level playing field we all once had, where the good gained advantage with knowledge. Anyways just my two cents. Just curious if I am alone on this. Oh I forgot to mention the sounds, every standard halo noise is basically gone. 









 After the birth of my son 11 weeks ago I've been somewhat out of the halo loop, I'm on right now and noticed the anniversary big team playlist is no longer available. Why did I buy them if I can't play them, am I missing something? 


































 Hey everyone, I'm at a loss as to where I'm supposed to turn next so I thought I would try r/newfoundland. My wonderful mother 74 years of age was a victim of robbery this past week. She has never been an overly wealthy woman, using what little wealth she has to support her very large family. Her house is small and quaint and doesn't contain many valuables (her television is tubed and her stereo is 15 plus years old, among the rest of her things that were left behind by the thieves). She has always been content with her humbled life and the only valuables she's ever really had came in the form of a few small rings passed down through the generations of our family. These rings of course hold no real monetary value (very small weight in gold), but the sentiments they hold in my mothers heart are unmatched. 

I know this is such a long shot but if anyone has seen or heard anything in regards to breaking and entering and the sale of used jewelry on the streets in the Grand Falls area, could you please let me or the police know. It would mean so much to her to actually retrieve these small items and/or see the culprits brought to justice.

I completely understand that there are problems in our society, and that drug addiction among other things, can bring people to carry out the unspeakable, but it breaks my heart knowing that there are those who prey on the elderly. It's about time these actions are taken seriously by the system, and the law works in favor of the victims.

If by some even slimmer chance someone who was directly involved manages to read this, if you somehow still have my mothers jewelry and have it in you to return it, I will most certainly not pursue this any further, I would walk away knowing that all hope isn't lost. I would forgive you personally, and I will hold that gesture in such high regard for the rest of my time on this earth. I do not wish to seek revenge, but to make things right.

If you think you might know something and require further description please PM me.

Thank you for your time. 










































































 Came here to state this. For a second there I thought I somehow resubscribed. 




 I thought the same thing haha. 




 Cool thanks. 




 Damn, what a beautiful piece of work. You're a lucky dude/dudette. 




 Where does one acquire such a thing?  









 I just finally received a shipment confirmation email with a tracking number. Package is currently in Richmond, BC and is to make it to Calgary by Friday apparently. $65 brokerage fee? Wut? 




 Would you happen to be outside the US? 




 Never rely on hitler for anything. 




 Has anyone outside the USA received their box set yet? I am in Canada and still without mine and my wife's Christmas gift. Just curious, thanks.
 




 Yes. Then I would buy it when it came out. 




 Damnit, where did the time go? 




 BTBAM - The Parallax II

NIN - Hesitation

Deafhaven - Sunbather   









 Nice, thanks for the info! 




 So how's the DVD quality? 




 WiFiday The 13th. 




 Also, awesome username! 




 I bet /r/horror would enjoy this, definitely cross post it over there. Good work, looks awesome. 




 Me as well I would like to know. 




 Thanks, really looking forward to it now. 




 Goddamn that's nice. Did they give you an email when they shipped it? I'm still waiting on mine. Also, I'm in Canada so not sure if it'll take much longer. It's supposed to be the Christmas gift for my wife and I. 




 Best username for this comment. 




 I'm sorry. 




 My friend just sent me this link:

[http://www.redflagnews.com/environment-headlines/urgent-two-radcon-5-alerts-on-west-coast-within-48-hours-disturbing-video#sthash.r5bcV4br.dpbs](http://www.redflagnews.com/environment-headlines/urgent-two-radcon-5-alerts-on-west-coast-within-48-hours-disturbing-video#sthash.r5bcV4br.dpbs)

And I got to thinking that something seems awfully fear mongering about that video which leads me to believe there is some kind of hidden agenda. Not to say that nuclear waste seeping into the ocean isn't a huge concern for every person on the planet right now, but something about that video didn't seem right to me.

I just wanted some sort of scientific take on the matter. How imminently fucked are we really? Can it be contained? Does it require more attention from the world than it is getting? 

Thanks in advance.

 




 William Peter Blatty's "The Exorcist" and "Legion". I loved both of these. 




 [Okay](http://i.imgur.com/yZDgZJt.png) 




 That's not the point. I wasn't trying to promote self loathing here, more the idea of self realization, in that you are among the masses creating the traffic problem. It's a humbling and calming gesture to understand that every single person on the road around you would like to get home as badly as yourself. When the roads are as bad as they are we owe it to ourselves and each other to exercise extra precaution, and seeing each vehicle as another human being can help alleviate some of that anxiousness and frustration. I find that it works for me anyways, it's easy to ignore the thoughts and feelings of those around you when you're separated by metal cages.    




 That is awesome.

 [We're in this together](http://youtu.be/P9BfvPjsXXw)
 




 [Although I don't find his music overly relevant anymore, this song still gets me.](https://youtu.be/Rthl_O4_G2o) 




 - New inexperienced drivers

- People with zero winter condition experience (from warmer climates)

- Impatient ~~20 something~~ people with giant 4x4 trucks who think they can         stop as fast as the can accelerate

- Old people/nervous drivers white knuckled at the first sight of moisture (this could go back to my first point)

- Tailgaters

- Insufficient snow clearing of Calgary roads

- Overpopulation (road design doesn't match population boom)

To me it's everyone in unison forming one giant problem. We are all to blame, whether or not you're the perfect driver, you're still in traffic, which to me makes you part of the problem. 

Just like the idea of the zipper merge on an engineer's notebook, it looked great on paper but as soon as you throw a bunch of different personalities behind it, it becomes a cluster fuck. I think patience for one another is the key to making our [drive time commute](http://youtu.be/Dvx5GL_9MD0) a little more tolerable.

I have to agree with /u/Ardal and the police on this matter. Let's all slow the fuck down, take a breath, and let's get home in one piece without having to call our insurance companies.

 









 Nice man, I almost didn't buy it so glad that I did. 




 This was the funniest comment I've read all day. I don't actually laugh out loud very often. 




 Hello Mr. Reznor.

First off I would like to simply say thank you, your music has accompanied me throughout the past 19 years of my life, I am a huge fan and very grateful for the wonderful music you have brought into this world.

1) As a new father my life has literally changed a great deal (for the better). I wanted to know how you deal with being away from your children while on tour, and how else being a father affects your career.

~~2) This question has probably been asked more times than anything else but here goes, I know that both you and Maynard came to an agreement that tapeworm wasn't ranked as a 10/10 by your standards, however, will we ever see a collaboration between you guys in the future? Do you guys keep in touch, and/or humor this idea?~~


Thanks for dropping by.

EDIT: Please ignore question two.
 




 [I imagine it would be a lot like the covenant from Halo.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_(Halo) 




 Either or, I am willing to drive to dreadmonton. 




 If they came to Calgary I would be so happy. 














 What power? 




 Instantly reminded of these guys.

 [Evergreen Terrace - Everlong](http://youtu.be/zZ2iw-kaa-k) 




 Very well put together argument. 




 Awesome brother! Glad it all worked out. Again sorry we got split up at the end. Enjoy the gold! Tell me what it does actually because I'd love to know haha. 




 First off I want to give much thanks to /u/Xenophorge for the FREE floor ticket so that a friend of mine could make it, the four of us had a great time. I'd post the reddit love story picture, but I don't want to commit to putting my face on these parts just yet.

Having said that I want to say the show was fucking awesome, setlist had a little more top 40 than I would have liked but I could definitely live with it. The highlights for me without a doubt [Pino Palladino's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pino_Palladino) performance, the guy fucking nailed it and did it with such class and style. I really thought he fit the bill perfectly. Everyone seemed spot on and enthusiastic, however you could definitely sense how the tour was wrapping up though, almost as a sigh of relief from each performer. I won't say they were lacking energy, but  there was a definite aura of depletion in the air, in that each member was looking forward to resuming their family/home life.

I don't know if as a result of this the light show suffered a little or not. But we seemed to have missed out on a lot of the 3D effects that I have been seeing around these parts as of late. All in all it was amazing and I wouldn't have traded it for anything. 

Trent will never cease to amaze me as an artist, musician, and front man. The fact that he has managed to keep NIN relevant throughout my early teenage years and well into my adulthood blows me away. I hope he stays with us for decades to come. 

That is all /r/NIN, I just wanted to share a few quick thoughts with you. I love to hear what you guys think as well.

 




 Yeah it was a gift, and due to our dry climate here they don't last very long. It was out of the box for less than 12 hours. 




 Canada. 














 Damn. 




 [What's wrong with Autolux?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilzH4eco7lA) 




 Decent argument and perspective. 




 I'm glad I'm not the only one to notice. See you around. 




 Yeah, it really should be /r/townies. 




 Me too. 




 Sure, it's all good. My shark moose post was just the most recent to spark my attention. It's really not about what I post, but mostly what others do. I lurk here for the most part, and I rarely ever go to the front page of this sub, so if I made a repost as my argument point then I really only have myself to blame for that. Having said that though, this has been something I've noticed for over a year now. Again, maybe I only check in at the wrong times or something, in the end I find this place uneventful and boring, with a lot of downvote trolls. Is it just me or do very relevant comments  garner downvotes? I don't get it, like most subs there has to be a moment of self realization that the downvote button isn't a disagree button, perhaps this one has yet to understand that. 




 rant Yes /r/Newfoundland, I'm talking about you. I've been subbed since the beginning of my reddit life, and in that time I've noticed the horrible trend that established itself here as the norm. Seemingly every post I see that actually has to do with Newfoundland current events, culture, or politics becomes a barren waste land of downvotes and ignorance. I don't think I've come across one thought provoking comment section to date. Yet, when a fucking cartoon like Christmas tree from the goddamn Avalon mall gets posted, watch out, something all the St. John's yuppies can relate to. It's obvious who runs this place, and it's too bad. Much like Newfoundland itself, where 90% of the island is overlooked because of loud mouth St. John's walking around distracting everyone from what else is happening. Seriously, A POST ABOUT A GREENLAND SHARK CHOKING ON A MOOSE GETTING SAVED BY TWO RANDOM GUYS GOT DOWNVOTED BUT THAT GODDAMN CHRISTMAS TREE SPARKED DISCUSSION AND NOSTALGIA. Sorry, didn't mean to yell, but that was the last straw. I'll check back in a few years and see if you got your shit together. /rant 









 I have a friend who may want to come, please stand by. 




 Went to Michael's. They're matted 22x28 frames I think. 




 Got them at the show I attended. 









 Hey thanks. It cost a pretty penny but worth every cent. 




 So what you're saying is the Avalon Mall is as important and iconic to the rest of Newfoundland and its people as it is to all the local yuppies? Yes, downvote for criticism I get it. 









 And here I am... 




 CTRL+F "Yo d..", ah, there it is. 




 I see. 




 Ok, so I'm a Newfoundlander living away from Newfoundland (big surprise I know), I was just curious as to what I'm missing here and what this could possibly have to do with Newfoundland.

EDIT: Typical r/newfoundland, point out how a post has nothing to do with Newfoundland and get downvoted.  









 Ok, I'm sorry. 




 I am in western Canada, and I love it here.

EDIT: Oil and gas is huge here, and I know that will always be a viable option. I'm really looking to keep my ear to the ground for new up and coming industries that I could possibly get into. 




 I'm a 31 year old licensed airframe worker that has been in my trade for 10 years, things are looking pretty grim in my industry and it may be time for a move in the next year or so. If I am to make a move, I want to make sure it's a smart one and in the right direction, with job stability for at least the next 40 years. I have a hands on skills with precision tooling, and mathematics has always been my area of interest. Although I don't feel it is necessary to continue working in the trades, I am also not opposed to it. 

I'd really love reddit's opinion on the matter.
 




 Dude, I'm sorry. 




 Bah 




 It's solid brass though, and it was a gift as well haha. 




 Hah! 




 It ain't easy being Canadian. 




 Absolutely, much appreciation went out to those behind it. 




 Yes, and he tripped and fell on his ass trying to get in. 




 Much force was needed to secure it together, the secret was to apply this force throughout the entire build so that everything sat flush and level as possible. 




 Probably magnesium, copper, and tungsten.  




 Hah, thanks, you too. Although this post was made late yesterday and my birthday is now over. 




 More images:

 Yes it is megabloks. As far as I know the Halo franchise teamed up with them as opposed to Lego. After building this thing I thought the quality was great even though most opinions usually say otherwise.  




 No he doesn't, sorry dude. 




 Hey thanks. 









 Haha wow. Thanks! 




 [Here's the picture.](http://i.imgur.com/LRERSVm.png) 




 Hey thanks a lot, I will try and swing by tonight and check out both stores. 




 [I agree](http://i.imgur.com/3EOUqnC.png) 




 Hey thanks! 




 Me either. 




 Hey thanks a lot! 




 Thanks a lot, I was thinking they were a bit pricey. 




 Beautiful. 




 Sweet baby Jesus, thank you. 




 I much rather save the time and spend hard earned money. 




 Sigh. 




 I know the ugly Christmas sweater fad has pretty much run it's course over the years, but I would love to look as Christmassy as possible for my company party. Thanks for any help in advance! 




 Excellent pick. At the Heart of it All is a great choice. 




 Quake soundtrack maybe? 




 /r/gore

There you go you depraved sick fuck. 




 I shan't feed the trolls anymore. 




 Not really, just read the full synopsis of A Serbian Film, and the August Underground series. 




 Thank you. 




 The question: "Hello fellow horror lovers, have you any recommendations for something more depraved than AU or ASF?"

My answer: "Yeah, they're called snuff and child pornography"

TL;DR: The only thing more depraved than those movies (in my mind) would be the true horrors of real life. I believe you read my reply out of context.
 




 I'm sick for mentioning it? Says the guy looking for something more shocking and "ate up" than the infamous "baby" scene of ASF. How depraved do your horror movies have to be before it's reality, this is the basic point I am making. There's a fine line between art and an obsession with death. 




 Yeah, they're called snuff films and child pornography. Why the hell do you need more hardcore than either of those? I haven't seen them, but a quick read of their synopsis is enough to make me sick to my stomach. 




 I really don't know much about how law works, and I know a quick google search would give me the courts definition of "sane". However how does it make any sense that a human capable of murder, rape, dismemberment, cannibalization, and attempted zombification can be considered anything but bat shit crazy? I mean I get that he was well aware of his actions entitling his "sane" verdict, but I find the whole thing confusing. 




 This is the worst fan sub of all time, did you really expect an answer? 




 This picture actually made me laugh, thanks for that. I found your dog reminded me of [this guy](http://m.imgur.com/ME0q6h3). 

You should post him to /r/photoshopbattles. 









 Wow, this is really interesting. Thanks for the info! 




 I have that same "I want to believe" poster. I thought it was some kind of rip off of the one seen in [Mulder's office](http://biglight.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/MuldersOffice.gif). I wonder what the story is behind it. 




 Nasty little buggers. 









 Thanks anyway, good luck. 




 I know a guy who would kill for a floor seat in Calgary. I live here so if you had one I'd meet you.

EDIT: realized how insane that comment sounded after I wrote it. Seriously, my buddy has never seen them, and missed out on the floor ticket sales. 




 Yeah just pop the multiplayer disc in anytime you want to play halo 3 multiplayer. 




 Don't buy the DLC, I'm sure you can find a copy of Halo 3 ODST for cheaper than what Microsoft is selling the DLC for. All halo 3 multiplayer DLC comes with the Halo 3 ODST disc. 




 Hahaha. This is the best comment I've ever read. 




 I would like to say Heat. It's not scary, but I find it super intense, which is really the secondary wavelength of fear, enticing you in much the same way.

[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113277/?ref_=nv_sr_3](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113277/?ref_=nv_sr_3) 









 I know, it's fucking scary to think that us humans are capable of such atrocities. With all of our technological advancements and general understanding of our universe, it's almost hard to believe. Like anything I guess, it can be defective. The human brain that we are gifted unfortunately doesn't come with a warrenty, it's up to the rest of us to sort out these crossed wires. 




 I think I'm going to be sick. 
























 Yes, I have become self aware. 




 Perhaps yeah. I'm going to estimate 1993 - 1994. 




 I feel this has become a very hilarious game of "Guess Who?", good fun old chap. 




 I need an adult. 




 Low attention span I believe.  




 Wat. 




 Go fish. 




 I know the type you're talking about, I think everyone in the industry will meet a few quantity over quality people during their aviation travels. Which of course is very unfortunate. Hope it all works out for you.  




 I'd love to order a print of this. I feel like this is the second time I wrote this comment to this picture in this sub. Dj vu. Anyone know the original photographer? 




 Very cool. 




 Thank you, and I hope you get to fly one as well. Good luck. 




 That's very interesting. Did you work on the original Twin Otters by any chance? 




 When and why did you make the switch? 




 Will do, thanks for the support! 




 A wise mechanic once put skydiving in perspective for me, "Why would you jump out of a perfectly good airplane? Even if this thing is on fire, let's ride it out a little and see where it goes." 




 Yes it is, the Calgary division. 




 I've never been on one, but I hear they're awesome. 




 Ha! No I am not, I assure you I am in the picture but wish to remain anonymous. I've never posted my face to reddit before, so I imagine this will be the closest I will get.  









 I used to have a large array of handles, but my main one was "Iceman". Thought I'd see if there are anymore of you out there. 




 Done and done, thank you! 




 Goddamnit I love Tina. She has to be one of the best characters on animated television. I feel star struck on the Internet now, thanks.  I just want to say thank you so much for the entertainment and please keep doing what you're doing, Bob's Burgers is awesome. How can I get an autograph from Tina? 
 




 NOoooooooooooOOOoooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!! 









 Unfortunately I cannot shed light on the quality, as I've only just begun collecting my favourite albums on vinyl and have not yet invested in a setup. This of course is something I want to do right and make sure I am financially prepared so it'll be a ways away. All I can tell you is Diamond Eyes is on white vinyl and that it was indeed the 85 dollar bundle (95 Canadian for myself).

EDIT: I believe they are all 180 gram. 









 [The article](http://wtop.com/256/3574525/Texting-walking-more-risky-than-distracted-driving) 









 This will definitely garner downvotes but ever since I've watched the True Detective series, looking back on Dexter is like trying to remember the plot of an Archie comic. 




 Cool shots, thanks for sharing. Didn't see any of Pino. Did he not tour this leg? I really love his style, was hoping he would be a permenant any member. 




 I too, choose to believe this happened. Amazing. 









 Interesting.  




 Thanks man, I've been waiting for this bundle to pop up again. Just placed my order. 









 Nice try officer.

EDIT: Minus Police. 




 I received "Closing Time" as a Christmas present one year. As a result whenever I listen to it I'm reminded of early evenings with wine and cigarettes in the snow.

EDIT: Redundancy. 




 I've always wanted to find the time to make a compilation of every time Scully's eye twitches. This is also good, thanks! 




 [Jacob's Ladder.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099871/)

EDIT: I should add this is one of my all time favourite movies, not just as a horror either. It's from 1990, but holds up really well IMO.
 









 Yeah I hear you. I'm looking forward to it. 




 Grand is an excellent description. 




 Stinkfist. 

My favourite single. 

Spookiest. Grittiest. Most surreal. 




 I think [HR Giger](http://www.hrgiger.com) would also be a phenomenal choice. 




 I'd love to see it happen, although yes I know it's highly unlikely.

That's what I meant by that statement, I probably should have been more descriptive. 




 Definitely not against this idea. 




 I'm a fan of Alex Grey's work, don't get me wrong, but I just really love Aenima's style the most. I'd love to see it happen, although yes I know it's highly unlikely. Thoughts? 




 Me too, it's quickly moving up the ladder of my favourite APC tracks.  




 I start my work day every morning at 6AM with this song and a cup of joe. Actually makes it bearable. 




 I just wanted to say that I think the live version of "when the levee breaks" on Stone   Echo is goddamn fucking amazing.

That is all. 




 On the link you posted. 




 Ah, no I haven't. Thanks for the heads up. 




 CTRL+F a few key words I wrote with no results. Will it be updated? 




 It's Wednesday. 




 I would frame this if I knew where to get it. 




 Hey thanks for that. I'm prepared for the massive crowd and long line ups, at least I think I am. Either way, getting my evil dead poster signed is more important to me than actually meeting him. I guess I'll just have to wait and see. 




 Yeah it can be very tiring carrying a 30 pound kid everywhere. Especially for my poor pregnant wife at 7 months when I'm not around, essentially carrying two kids every time she has to leave the house.  




 I am strictly speaking from a Canadian stand point, I usually have the opposite problem as yourself, this is of course assuming you're American. 




 Thanks. 




 Hey thanks for the info. I'll look into it. 




 Nope, I'm talking Calgary. But I'm sure it's the kind of tour or setup.  




 Not sure if this is the appropriate sub for this or not, but the one and only Bruce Campbell will be at this years comic con and I'm a huge evil dead fan. This was enough to spark my interest and get me really excited about attending this year. Now I should add that I've never attended one of these before so please forgive my noobishness. 

I'd really like to know what Bruce is like for those of you whom have met him, I am not really the nervous type but have a feeling he'll set me back a step. More importantly what's the etiquette for getting stuff signed? Can you bring more than one item if any at all? Or do they make you purchase while inside?

I think that about sums it up, it's going to be really cool to meet a guy like Bruce, even if it is only for a minute. Thanks in advance dreddit. Again sorry if wrong sub. 
 




 Dude, I've had a girl tell me this exact same thing, then even go as far as naming the baby girl after my Mother. I didn't think I could afford a paternity test at the time, and thought it wasn't worth it because you know, she named her after my mom and all. My brother who was much more established than I was at the time insisted on paying for the test, lo and behold the baby wasn't mine. I was surprised at first even though it was only a one night stand deal that turned into a few more times afterwards, but apparently this chick was going through a really bad break up and this was her way of coping, obviously not filling me in on the details.

Either way, I didn't mean to bore you with the details seeing how you are probably in a much different situation, but goddammit, that paternity test changed my life. Please do yourself the favor before doing anything else.

That was 11 years ago and I am currently happily married with an 18 month old boy, and a girl on the way. I'm really not sure if any of that would have come to fruition had I taken her word for it. Speaking of which, I should call my brother, what an awesome guy.

EDIT: Grammar. 

EDIT: Spelling. 




 My son is about to turn 18 months next week and he still doesn't walk. He did however start the spider walk yesterday (feet flat on the floor, legs straight, and moving forward with his hands) so I'm hoping that's a good sign. I was having this same question/thought plague my mind the other day, and I keep asking myself if I am doing anything wrong. 

On that note, it sounds like your son is doing fine, the whole army crawling thing is just another variation of crawling I believe, I watched a niece of mine develop the same way and she turned out to be a very smart and sweet little girl (age 7 now). I remember thinking it was peculiar, but it was just another developmental step before she was up and running. Otherwise everything else sounds right on par. Enjoy it while you can, babies are so sweet, I will miss these days I just know it. 




 Interesting. Tis a shitty situation she put you guys in, hopefully she'll cool off enough so you can track her down. 




 I do not personally know or have I communicated with your sister, however I would probably start with her account history, to see if any of the information she's posted in the last while makes any sense to you or the rest of your family. Good luck. 




 Pretty sure this is as high res as it gets.

 Yeah, USPS is a pile of horse shit. 




 Would it be possible for you to transfer those to imgur? The Facebooks are blocked at my work place, and I am a very impatient person. If not no worries, thanks. 



















 Nice thanks OP! 




 This is what I do when I laugh on the internet ---- "hahahaha". I'm never sure if it comes off as sincere or not. 




 Surely op will deliver. 




 I too am having this problem. What the hell? 














 Totally what I meant to say. 




 Quoting ~~hooker with a penis~~ aenima in a tattoo thread on /r/toolband.

EDIT: Brain fart. 




 PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!! 




 May I too have the recipe when you wake up, these look amazing. Thank you. 









 I know, tool putting their twist on that song would fucking intense. 




 [Echoes](http://youtu.be/uJtw7SP0oN4) 




 Congratulations man, that's huge news!
 




 Thank you very much, I hope my little angel will be as observant as yours! 




 I've also heard of this method, but am very reluctant to use it. Although it may be effective, I don't want my child to associate me with physical pain. 




 I try asking him what's wrong, but he doesn't really have a grasp of the English language yet, only uses a few words. But I make sure to talk to him as much as I can, pointing and naming everything in sight. I'm hoping for that language explosion any day now. 

As for stomping feet he still doesn't walk, however when he gets frustrated with his toys for whatever reason he will let out a squeal and throw a small tantrum until one of us can help him out. 




 We more or less do this now, I guess persistence is the name of the game. Thanks! 




 I have no idea honestly, it seems to be some sort of play fighting. I know his intent is fairly harmless, but it needs to stop either way. He is a really active child, we have a hard time keeping up with him, he has no interest in television and loves to drive his cars around on the floor and dance to music, I doubt it's an surplus of energy. I'm hoping it's some sort of phase that will dissipate as he develops his sense of empathy. 




 This sounds like a much better process than my current voice raising. It breaks my heart because he pouts when I tell him what he's doing wrong. I know he doesn't know any better and that he may even have a hard time understanding me, and that this is method I use probably isn't going to be effective in the long term. 

Thanks so much for your thoughtful reply, I will definitely try it out. 




 Hello /r/parenting, I'm so glad I found you this past week. I can tell I have much to learn from you guys and I look forward to growing with you. Having said that, I am new to fatherhood with my 17 month old son, and his soon to be born baby sister. So far I am having a blast, with all the ups and downs, all I know is I wouldn't change it for the world and that this has been the best experience of my life so far.

The reason I come to you guys with this post is that currently my son has started to hit really hard, he has always had a thing for pulling my wife's hair, but now he's doing both to us. I really don't know how to react when he does this, should I be firm and tell him no? Or should we try not to draw any attention to it. So far I've been doing my best to make him understand that it hurts and that he shouldn't do it, but it's seemingly having no effect.

I'd really like to know how to deal with this especially before our little girl enters the situation and becomes another victim. Thank you so much for any help you can offer.  




 There's always a way, I have seen Jurassic Park 34+ times. 




 Yeah, I'd say when the day comes I require its services, it'll be all fixed up. 




 J'ai mang une motoneige avec des poissons? 




 Wow, what is this world coming to? 




 Probably not an intended media server, but a little go get'em attitude can fix that. PS3 wasn't an intended media server either, but it's probably my favourite one I've ever owned up to this point. 




 Fucking halo made me get the Xbone, even though it isn't even out yet. Regardless, when my PS3 dies as my current media server, and the price is right, I'll replace it with the PS4.

The fact that they are both lack backwards compatibility really irks me all the same, Street Fighter Alpha 3 for the PS is one of my all time favorite games, so if my PS3 ever does bite the dust I don't know what I'll do.

EDIT: I called every future shop/wal mart/best buy/visions ect ect. in the city when I tried to purchase the Xbone and there was zero availability if that means anything. 




 TIL the PS4 is way better than the Xbone. 




 I had the same problem with the xbone, so I ordered it from future shop's website with free shipping. Showed up at my door in 1.5 days VIA Canada post. Not sure if it would be similar for the PS4, but it's worth a shot. 




 Ahh yeah, you're right, it totally is a mirror. Very similar to the [inspection mirror](http://imgur.com/tiaPDfj.jpg) I use at work. 




 Excess string spooled up? 




 I had the same thing with the DVD, waited about a week and a bit, then got the shipment confirmation email the other day. So they will replenish their stock. 









 I love this thing striss, great work!

EDIT: Can we secure an area while we're working on it? Probably put a timer on there so if one forgets it'll automatically reset and be available to the public once again. I was drawing a flag, came back in an hour and someone had it messed up, now I'm pouting and don't want to continue. 




 Although his/her answer was thorough and awesome, s/he did allude to Calgary being more of a white collar town, which is really not the case. Maybe on the surface it would appear that way, but there are many trades for one to get into. Even with only a high school diploma, you could definitely get your foot in the door as a pipe fitter and make a great living in a few years. Do you know people in either town or surrounding areas? That would be the biggest deciding factor for me. 




 Good old Sook Yin, I used to have a huge crush on her growing up. I seriously miss the 90's MuchMusic format, back when the programming actually covered music, and music related subjects. Yes, we live in a different era and they have to pander to what sells, I'm just disappointed. Please don't link me to the MTV guy ranting to people like me.

I thought she did a decent job with the interview, maybe a tad nervous, but that probably comes from being a big fan. I thought Maynard handled the tool related questions just fine, he more or less finger pointed towards the other guys at the end there, but that's nothing new.

EDIT: [She's still looking cute as ever](http://m.imdb.com/name/nm0498271/)

 I had a small click of friends that slowly expanded throughout high school, some of my expansion pack friends were more popular and went to parties with people who I generally didn't associate with (jocks and preps I believe were the terms we used back then). I recall going to one of these parties (somewhere around 1998), where the booze kicked in and I had the balls to stop the music that was currently playing, whatever it was I remember it being terrible. Either way I remember dropping on aenima that I had brought (I never left the house without 15-20 cd's and a discman in my backpack). I was expecting contorted faces of disgust and hatred, however stinkfist kicked in and everyone seemed to mesh to it, and it was awesome. Then I thought to myself, ok, this will all change when Die Eier Von Satan comes on. Waited patiently for that industrial German racket to begin with my troll face in gear. Again, a room full of people from all clicks just had the best time, it was the first time I think I realized that maybe it was me who was the asshole and not everyone else. It's like I shed a layer of hatred that night.

I have no idea why I just replied to your message with this.

EDIT: Grammar/additional info. 




 I have to agree with you. This video was on the front page yesterday after all. I'd say it's probably OP. 




 Hey thanks a lot, I'll look into it. My only concern is waiting right now, I like the idea of not having to order from amazon. But it's good to have options. Thanks again for the info. 




 Can you make any recommendations? 




 I'm looking to upgrade my desktop computer sound system, was wondering if any of you fine people have any experience with the [Harman Kardon Soundsticks III](http://www.memoryexpress.com/Products/MX44014)? 




 Thank you kind internet person. 




 Thank you very much! 









 I've never seen it. I guess I should check it out?

EDIT: "You" = "I". 




 Thanks. I also love the song "Rosie" by Tom Waits, and then of course there's Interpol and their song "Evil". I thought to myself, this name is mentioned way too many times in songs I love. 




 Thank you. 




 I am a little bit of a collector, however I don't mind sampling most things from the internet, but when it comes to music I feel the urge to physically own it. Maybe I'll take your advice until I can find a copy! 




 I hadn't taken part in this poll, but am very surprised to see "Rosemary" so high up in the rankings. I also love this song, and have talked to my wife and we have agreed to use "Rosemary" as the name for my daughter to be. Glad people love it as much as I do. 




 Will do thanks. I ended up ordering it off amazon but they were out of stock so I have to wait for them to get more. In the meantime I'll try music stores around the city. 




 It was definitely worth it. Also, the live DVD is amazing. 









 Is there anywhere else to purchase this item other than [puscifer.com](http://www.puscifer.com)? The $30 shipping charge is astronomical, and I haven't found another place to buy it yet. Any info would be awesome, thanks. 




 I just had one at [Oasis](http://www.experienceoasis.ca/index.php) yesterday, they do fine work. No membership required. 




 Awesome. 




 Haha I am not surprised.
