 just out of curiosity...did you do your own health plan or follow p90x? 




 I don't understand all the hate coming towards this. You started with an already slim figure so the results aren't as drastic. However, you can definitely tell they are there. Congrats on finishing the 90 days! whats next? Insanity? Another Round?  




 quinoa is not easily bought near where i live as there aren't of ton of organic stores and all the main stores don't carry it 




 Hey all: this is my second week of p90x. For the first week i just took a normal diet and put it through loseit.com just to see what my percentages were. I roughly averaged 40% carbs, 30%protein, 30% fat. Obviously the p90x fat shredder is 50% protein, %30 carbs, 20% fat. So how do i bring up that protein number in some practical ways?

Here is a sample day of meals for me:

* Breakfast:oatmeal
* lunch:ham and turkey pita with provolone cheese/baby carrots/and grape tomatoes
* dinner: white bean and garbanzo bean chicken chili(over minimal rice)
* snacks:almonds(roughly 20 throughout the day), spinach shake(this is my recovery drink: 1 banana, 1 scoop protein powder, 1.5 handfuls spinach, 1/3 cup almond milk, 2 tbs peanutbutter, ice)

also what do you look for in a protein bar? 




 Just did my second chest and back + ab ripper x workout...I increase my weight on lawn mowers by 10lbs and did everything but the mason twist in ab ripper x. Currently drinking my protein/recovery drink 




 ANd behold tomorrow is rest day and it is very good. lol. My legs are on fire! upper body not so much. I used this first week to get myself into the rhythm of working out consistently...next week should be no excuses! pushing my body to the limit! 




 Hey, I'm also am doing the program(today is my day 6) and I wanted to give you some tips. 3 pushups doesn't seem to be a lot. I would consider doing 10 but moving to your knees if you have to(this is what i do). Anything less than 10 and you will be resting too much and stiffen up. Also with the chin ups try to do negatives(use a chair or jump up to where your chin is above the bar and then release as slowly as you can) 




 basically i have one scv per a command center building supply depots at all times. 




 Do/Did you drink a recovery drink on yoga days? especially during the early weeks? I'm on week 1 and i don't feel like i worked out nearly close to as hard as the other days(mainly due to not being very flexible). 




 isn't that Katu? He does Playhem casting once a week i think. He even plays zerg at high level. I believe i watched him beat oGsIllusion the other night. 




 reply i'm on day 4 but i agree! 




 I'll be updating this occasionally with a log of how I am doing. Not sure if i should do multiple posts.

Today will be day 3 of week 1...tbh I've never attempted this exercise in all my attempts at p90x...I'm always so sore and quit...today..I'm still sore but i will do the exercise.

right now: 5 foot 11 inches @ 190lbs. Lots of stomach fat + no upper body strength. 




 its on esltvs site http://tv.esl.eu/de/vod/view/23547 




 I may be really dumb but I can't seem to find all of them. The take tv sight has some...but not all. Anyone know best place to get them? 




 The problem is someone bought p90x for me as I can not afford it or another one really :( 




 I'm a 23 year old male 6 foot 190 lbs. I'm not happy with my upper body muscle and fat. I've tried P90X a couple of times but everytime i start, by the 4th or 5th day my body is exhausted and doesn't feel like it can go anymore. What do/did you do to get past this hump? Or What did you do to recover faster? 




 but don't you have to buy the game twice to get a second account? 




 aka but the game twice. no thank you 




 always fun watching the lakers lose! 




 the problem with this is that the current metagame has terran going fast gas for both terran and zerg(reactor hellions, fast tank/viking, cloaked banshee) where as versus protoss you do either one or two rax fast expand(no gas) 




 Hey, Just a general question that I think is helpful against all races. How do you deal with random players? I have three distinct builds for each race i'm playing and I really need to know by 11 food what the other player is doing(so I can go gas first if terran). How do you approach Random?

EDIT:Specifically for terran 




 no. We had one computer. But i didn't want her using the same account as me/save file. So we had separate ones so we could each play the game at our own pace. She have her stats and I have mine.  




 i'm sorry i lived in a house where it was a luxury to get one game a year? Both myself and my sister needed to be able to play it without running over each other. 




 quick question people. I had a friend move into my house and they want to play starcraft2. Do they have to buy their own copy? That seems unlikely because of how many houses have multiple children 




 same here 




 Is anyone else having problem with ads freezing screens. Specifically there is a Nikon ad that never seems to close. I keep having to refresh the stream until i get a different ad 




 i suggest trolling back and reporting him for spam 




 why else do you think they were giving away free tickets? they weren't trying to be nice...they were trying to get people to show up 




  you should a)have scouted the 4 gates+robo(i think standard scan of your opponents main is around 6:30ish) b)still be able to hold it off(if you are constantly producing out of 2 rax(bc 3rd rax is getting an add on) you should have enough to hold. Plus your opponent is incredibly all in at that point(he can kill 10 of your scv's and it wont matter bc you have two base down). Use the scv's to soak up damage(right click autorepair when you pull them so they soak up even more damage). You should be able to hold. 




 definitely do the 1 rax FE against toss and just grab 2-3 bunkers if you feel in danger. 2 Bunkers/8Marines/3scv's per bunker on autorepair holds off a 4 gate. You should have a stronger army...don't let the protoss max! 




 what would you suggest in regards to add-ons and order?
 




 what would you suggest in regards to add-ons and order?
 




 yeah i was just so use to doing 13 rax that i auto did it without thinking. If i get the add ons and he is 4 gating dont i lose bc i'm not producing units for that minute? 




 nvrmind...uploaded  




 I also added a replay of both builds 




 replay added 




 where can i load replays?
 




 I'm in the states and lagging really hard 




 Their event went live over an hour ago to air the playoffs and all its been is watching Orb and Gretorp get set up and scrolling graphics. Incredibly unprofessional. You don't see other sports delaying their broadcasts by an hour without some explanation. Heck we don't even see other broadcasters do this. Ridiculous! 




 thank you! i started doing the one rax expand and i found out that if i can hold off a 4 gate(which i can with two bunkers and scv's set to autorepair) then i do much better/win the game :) 




 I'm a gold terran who can beat the occasional plat zerg and plat terran. I struggle against silver level protoss. Anyone have any tips. I open 3 rax into expand-mmm with vikings and ghost as neccesary and 3/3 ups. Still get destroyed by toss going colossi or DT's or anything

EDIT:Adding in replays for those of you that wanted it

3 rax: http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33 show=details id=242869

 gold terran/silver zerg

test_subject4671.465 




 So i was looking through the Open Bracket(http://s3.majorleaguegaming.com/2011-providence-starcraft2-open.html) and there are some sick matchups starting the day:

* Gatored(who beat Ganzi) vs Leenock
* EGMachine vs Nestea
* Spanishiwa vs TLO
* Losira vs colMVPsc
* Hero vs Keen
* Sheth vs Major/Terran/Princess/xSix[fillintheblank]


Personally I'm looking forward to Machine vs Nestea. I really like machine. Which of these matchups are you most looking forward to? 




 thank you! 




 i don't run adblock 




 I'm a MLG silver member and I can't  get a voucher for the event...any one else having same issues? 




 So i've been watching EGMachine and for the life of me I dont understand why he doesn't have more viewers. He commentates every single game and really interacts with his chat. Also, he seems to do well at MLG's beating players like Slush, Tyler, etc. He also keeps a pretty good schedule of streaming often.

 listen to this man. Battlestar Galactica is AMAZING 




 Hi! i'm a gold level Terran and i've been dominating TvZ using the MVP build. Here are some quick notes.

1.)you didnt expand fast enough. Using this build you should be able to throw down a little bit after you start producing Helions.
2.) only produce 4 helions. This is the amount you need to get map control. Remember, the MVP style is about not taking damage and controlling the map instead of causing damage via drone harass.
3.)Once you switch your 1st factory to a tech lab. throw down gas #2 and factory #2. I prefer getting  an early siege as opposed to stim since the MVP build has no medivac usage...you actually hurt yourself with stim.
4)as soon as your second siege tank finishes, float your orbital down to expansion(circa 7-9 minute mark), transfer scvs, build gas 3 4(2 workers in each), and throw down engineering bay for upgrades and turrets to defend mutas.
5.)now you can actually afford the 4 marines/2 seige tank/ 2scv/supply depot production you were trying to pull off. 3rd goes down around 11 minute mark which should also be when you make your first push. Keep marine behind siege tanks and have your tanks hot keyed to go into siege mode. AS SOON AS YOU SEE creep, seige up and take out 3,4 tumors. 

Thats all i can think of now. I may download a replay for you to see of me doing the build. Also, if you want to practice i play zerg as well test_subject4671.465 




 do you have an example (ie 2 rax into expand into factory or something like that) 




 hi all! gold level terran here. I'm struggling with the tvt match as i feel i really dont have a solid build or key idea. In silver league i could just mass marine marauder and get my upgrades to +3/+3 by the 16 min mark and win. Now in the gold league, other players macro is better and there is a significant use of siege tanks. I've been opening with a fast banshee build order:

10 supply
11 rax
13 gas
15 orbital
as soon as i have 100 gas-factory
once factory completes throw down reactor and starport
once starport finishes switch onto reactor...keep producing marines/tanks and expand...the problem is that even if i do damage (6 scvs) my opponents seem to be able to attack me and kill me.. any suggestions? 




 i posted this last night and got downvoted to hell :( 




 painuser was suppose to arrive at the airport a hour ago to be picked up by sir scoots...and no one has been able to get in contact with him. this all via dj wheat twitter. Just trying to get the word out there http://twitter.com/#!/djWHEAT/status/130110499521167361 














 Hello from a member of the ODU alumni! My entire starcraft 2 group is ODU alumn :) VT is cool..i guess  




 hey, if you want a practice partner i'm a silver terran test_subject4671.465  I would like some tvp practice :) 




 game 2 boxer vs alive: boxer went for a fake helion reactor into cloaked banshee build but alive had a viking out in time an took little to no damage. The rest of the game played out with alive macroing better than Boxer(who has floating over 1k gas during a good segment of the game). Alive eventually killed Boxer's 3rd and then pushed in with marine/tank for the win. Also boxer used the userid of JethroGibbs for this match WINNER:Alive 




 Split screen not working 




 i went on a losing streak this morning but i still am ranked #2 in a silver league and constantly playing gold players.  




 how do i post replayz 




 50-60 workers in my usual game with a 4th base up and saturated usually. not claiming my micro/macro is perfect 




 i do have an 80% win rate in silver lol..bout to be gold as soon as i play more games.  




 Hey everyone,

I keep reading posts here that say "blah you are only silver league, all you have to do is have good macro and you advance." With that said I'm currently sitting on the silver/gold cusp and i disagree. I'm doing builds versus each race(2rax vs z, 3rax stim mm push, fast banshee) and executing them really well and most people hold these off. I then proceed to have a 20+ minute game where the only time i get over 600  minerals is when i max(600 because two factory thor). So what's your opinion? do we not give the lower leagues enough credit?

EDIT: I'm not saying i'm the best..i'm merely asking if we give the lower leagues credit :) 




 hmm...maybe i'm too into soccer to be a good evaluator of this fact. I do know that ever Sat and Sun ESPN2 shows an EPL game. But i agree that soccer has a much larger following than SC2. 




 i watch a ton of soccer and have never seen a commercial interrupted game. 




 sports like soccer have 45 minute halves with no adds at all. They simply state "this match is brought to you my gatorade" or something like that. I could see it being the same. 




 test_subject4671.465 silver terran 




 I'm silver terran test_subject4671.465 




 Silver Terran who is on at random times test_subject4671.465 




 i mad i couldn't see the games 




 any hurricane survival guides for the people in raleigh 




 Well i'm silver league and like everyone said...its will eventually depend on what build you want to do... but honestly i would throw a nexus down as soon as i begin floating the minerals necc to build one...usually ends up working nice, at least for terran 




 that might be my problem then...i never repair. Thanks! :) 




 Hey guys...silver league noob here...trying to get better. Anyways..I'm really struggling vs protoss...i find the other matchups easy...but i literally can not figure out for the life of me how to stop 4 gate pushes...bunkers near the front of my base? they warp into the back..mass marauders-killed...mass marines-killed....rushed to tanks-killed...help please?

Watching streams doesnt help me bc pros dont forgate really in pvt or pvz

Edit:To THose asking about warping in back...warp prism . 




 Destiny advocates a one base roach push strategy to stop this. You overlord on 9, spawning pool on 12, gas on 14(3-workers immediately) as well as roach warren, get a queen, and drone up to 20/26..then non stop roach/overlord production..if he doesnt have roaches out you win...and if he does he can not stop producing them or you will win...and since you are putting pressure on you can use one of your drones to expand. 




 Hey everyone, right now i'm chillin in the silver league as terran and am doing okay. learning/getting better all that jazz. The other day i started experimenting with the other races just to get a handle on how to scout them/etc. During this i found playing zerg to be especially fun...enough so that i legitimately am considering switching. My one question is how do you determine the # of lings you need to make at any one point...i always seem to make too few and get killed by early 3rax/4gate plays. or if i try to do a roach build i always get cannon rushed by protoss. I find if i can get to late game i'm beating everyone...so anyhelp stopping these early game pushes would be nice. 




 honestly i was able to beat the computer on hard/very hard by just microing out marine/maruader/medivac....but that does not prepare you for the game...I think its much better to just play 2-3 games on the ladder every day...as you play you should start to notice good timings etc 




 I started out just like you losing almost all my games. I quickly got very frustrated. What i found out is that i just didnt have a plan, i was building units willy-nilly and losing. I would suggest Day9 Dailies 257,267,285,and 289. But honestly the most important one to watch and digest as terran is #312. Once i watched that daily it all clicked for me. I'm now residing as a top Silver league terran who should be in gold any day now. 
























 lol i feel like i should get an achievement. Beginning was filled with newness but by the end of the week i knew the workouts and was killing them... also I DID MY FIRST REAL PULLUP TODAY! 




 if you go to chick fila and get one of their grilled chicken sandwhiches that suppose to be good. Tropical smoothie salads can be good just ask for splenda instead of sugar in smoothie and be careful on dressings. Subway is fine but i would just tear a good section of bread off or get one of their salads 




 haha fair enough.  




 I played basketball and soccer throughout highschool and on an inter-mural level in college.  Every time I stretched before a game/practice. I ended up pulling something or having it tense on me. I also do find static stretching boring but i can deal with boring. 

I feel that for me going for a mile run or playing some basketball is more effective in getting my muscles to relax 




 yeah i knew I would get downvoted on this. I'm a big proponent of not doing static stretches...as I've only gotten hurt/tense through them. Since all Xstretch is static stretches i pass on it. I'd rather do more cardio. 




 i thought about it but i really need the ability to quickly change weights as I'm using them with p90x 




 Hey everyone,

i've been using these 25 lb adjustable dumbbells i got from walmart for most my work outs to this point. However there are already some moves(like lawnmowers!) that these aren't heavy enough for. My real life cake day is coming up so I'm trying to get some money for one of the larger selectable dumbells. Which is the best? Bowflex? My main priority is that i need to be able to quickly change weights and price is nice too
 









 i suggest not doing stretch x as who really wants to waste an hour of time stretching????????? But I'm probably in the minority on this one. 




 i wouldn't rest all together as i feel once you stop its really hard to start back up. maybe just lower intensity of everything(ie just do stretch/balance postures on yoga. on kenpo day go for a walk etc). But honestly thats just my thoughts. Only you know what is right for you. Listen to your body :) 




 i replace Kenpo with running the basketball court for two hours but I think that's a little different. I would not trade plyo in for anything as it is such a killer cardio workout. In the end i don't get to decide what is too much for your shoulders/arms...only you can. Standard exercise advice states yuo want to rest them after workout so they can recover....but shouldn't you be using your legs mostly in rock climbing anyways? 




 i mean if you measure the effectiveness of a workout via weight then that might be a good investment for you. I only lost two lbs in the first month but my body looked different. Its really up to you. :) 




 not even 1? not even on your knees? lol just messing. Do your best and forget the rest! 




 yeah...a ton of upper body muscle. My upper body was underdeveloped most my life due to playing basketball and soccer. I went from not being able to do a normal pushup to being able to easily crank out 20. 




 yeah

my menu for a week is something like this:

Breakfast for week: nonfat Yogurt + protein bar OR oatmeal with banana..on weekends i'll cook 5 eggwhites and have two pieces wheat toast

Lunch for week: salad with turkey/ham( i keep a supply of spinach leafs, tomatoes, carrots, and turkey/ham from the deli in my work fridge) with some super low fat dressing(i use a honey mustard dressing i found at my local walmart)

DINNER for the week:

Sunday: Cook a whole bunch of chicken breast(5). Eat one with some brocolli. Store rest in fridge. Monday: Take one chicken breast(precooked) and make a chicken chili with navy beans and garbanzo beans(this should leave a bunch of leftovers that you can eat on days you don't feel like cooking. Tuesday: One Chicken breast and saute with one bell pepper(like fajitas!) Sprinkle low fat cheese on top and serve with vegi of choice. Weds: Take one chicken breast, shred and mix with 1/4 cup bbq sauce(low sugar!). sprinkle with a little cheese. Place on top of wheat english muffins and bake for 10 minutes to make mini-chicken pizza's(2-3 english muffins cut in half should be fine) Thursday:Remember that chicken chili? leftover time Friday:cut remaining chicken breast in half. shred and serve on top of salad. Saturday: Finish chicken chili at lunch. Other half chicken used in dinner of choice

combine this with a post workout proteinshake/recovery drink and you should be hitting 1900 calories per day and keeping pretty close to the 50% p, 25% c, 25%f suggested by P90x. When I get tired of chicken I'll change it up by having salmon or turkey italian sausage or a turkey burger.

If i get a hunger urge I eat about 10 almonds and drink some water and that seems to work for me 




 thats probably a clue from your body that you are ready for the phase 2 diet! The feeling you described is exactly the point the nutrition book suggest you switch. Hopefully the increased carbs helps :) 




 I did a really good job bringing it during plyo today...i sorta died near the end but definitely did better than the first 3 weeks. I think substituting basketball for kenpoX improved my cardio by leaps and bounds...and allowed me to have some fun ^.^
 




 haha third base in bronze 




 I hold myself up for 3 seconds before letting down 




 my tip would be to secretly do classic while everyone else does lean ;) seriously though! the lean version just has more cardio and less lifting..but if you do light lifting at high reps your results should be awesome. 

My only other tip is COMMIT COMMIT COMMIT. This is a one night stand...its a full fledged workout relationship. Keep a diet, do the work and you WILL get results 




 i'm doing 25 now lol(and struggling with it). My birthday is in march and i'll probably be needing heavier weights around that time as i hope to be pulling 45lbs eventually 




 awesome! Looks like you've put on more muscle than me but i lost a similar amount of belly to you. Lets keep it up :) 




 Day1: 0 normal pushups(had to do on knees), 0 normal pullups(couldn't do a negative either), 15 lb curl for 12 reps

Day 27: 20 High/low pushups(from core synergistics), 25 negative pullups, 25lb curl for 20 reps 




 yeah i was using a chair at first but i realized quickly after doing a couple negatives that the chair was ez mode compared to negatives. I would rather do fewer reps and get a real workout.  




 yeah. I went from eating out at lunch every day and most weekends to only eating stuff i cooked. and following the 50%, 25%, 25% fat burner diet principles

EDIT: Funny thing is  my new diet is cheaper on my budget and just as tasty :) 




 to be honest I don't remember what its called either ^.^ i just know that p90x suggested 2400 calories for me and i've been fine with 1900.  




 to be fair its still negatives. i can only do half a real pull up now. but i'm getting closer every day! :) 




 I don't use their recovery drink. I use my own suggested by my best friend(who happens to be a certified trainer):

1/2 cup almond milk
1 to 2 scoops protein powder(1 on cardio days, 2 on lifting days or days when you need protein boost)
1 banana
2 tbs peanut butter
1 handful of spinach
ICE

blend and drink. It tastes good and is healthy. If you don't have a blender a lot of people suggest a glass of skim milk mixed with nesquik chocolate mix as that apparently has a good proportion to proteins/carbs for good recovery 




 Its in the Dvds as well as stretching. You may wish to prolong the warmup depending on age/body 




 I lost about 2 inches off my waste and 3 off my stomach. Weight stayed the same but I'm fine with that bc i'm gaining muscle. 

The 50/25/25 basically states that 50% of your calories that day should come from protein. 25% should come from carbs etc
I do this by keeping a log of what i eat at loseit.com and using their report to tab to show the amount I'm bringing in a day. Honestly, because i'm eating so clean...I feel like I'm eating a lot more and am not that hungry. I eat often in small amounts to fight off hunger.

my menu for a week is something like this:

Breakfast for week: nonfat Yogurt + protein bar OR oatmeal with banana

Lunch for week: salad with turkey/ham( i keep a supply of spinach leafs, tomatoes, carrots, and turkey/ham from the deli in my work fridge) with some super low fat dressing(i use a honey mustard dressing i found at my local walmart)

If i get a hunger urge I eat about 10 almonds and drink some water and that seems to work for me
 




 here is what four weeks of classic and eating right has done for me weight wise: http://imgur.com/yk91M

this is my third attempt(and by far the farthest i've gotten) and it was MUCH easier this time. I've got a little soreness but not pain. Hopefully thats what you are doing too.

I would say if possible follow the principles of the fat burner diet (50% protein, 25% carbs, 25% fat) as that is probably the most important part 




 yeah. I went from eating out at lunch every day and most weekends to only eating stuff i cooked. I also stopped the videos several times during to make sure i got my reps in.I think a lot of the change is from finding out what it means to push myself. I probably could have done more at the beginning but my effort wasn't there 




 Info that might be of interest:

same pants in both picture. Use to have to suck in gut to put them on, now have to pull them up throughout the day.

Day1: 0 normal pushups(had to do on knees), 0 normal pullups(couldn't do a negative either), 15 lb curl for 12 reps

Day 27: 20 High/low pushups(from core synergistics), 25 negative pullups, 25lb curl for 20 reps 




 but BMI is a measure of height vs weight...so it hasn't changed(its also why BMI isn't an accurate tool for measuring heatlh) 




 i just posted my week 4 pics and honestly when i look in the mirror i don't believe i'm seeing change...but looking at the pics the change definitely happened/is happening. I believe the rest week you should see changes because your muscles are retaining water because of how heavily you are working them out. 




 No weight change. 190lbs. But that is fine as you can see the fat difference. Also i've gained significant strength

 









 i mean my macro is far from perfect and i have super low apm(30 avg)...but then again i think i have good decision making...my win rate against zerg is very high(80 ish percent) and my win rate against protoss is decent(50-60%)...but I rarely win tvt because i'm not good at the tank crawl...hence my asking for a better build since early game can create a huge advantage for me that i can use to roll my oponent 




 what do you do against fast doom drops and/or fast thors as marines aren't strong against repaired thors 




 yeah i lost 5 terran games in a row using the thorzain expand despite scouting the one base play every single time and preparing before hand. the only one i won was when i played my normal tank/marine build

EDIT: not saying its impossible, just that i lack the execution to perform it 




 added you 




 yeah start whatever day you want...I started on a saturday so that I could have my rest day on fridays. 




 http://sc2ranks.com/us/2781279/test_subject4671

and yes i know macro can be improved etc...but i just don't like the max army tank/viking/marine play at the end. I can manage one base pushes now...they just don't happen as often 




 Alright guys, I'm having trouble with TvT...I have basically a zero win percentage. The problem i have is that I am terrible with marine/tank/viking late game pushes. I tried doing the thorzain early expand build from Day9 but that proved to be worthless against any terran who was doing a 1 base all in with fast siege tanks. What is a good build that isn't necessarily cheesy but i good early push in tvt? 




 yeah i guess i shouldn't say i'm anti stretching as much as i am anti static stretching. I usually do stretch out in a ballistic manner 




 my problem with cheese is that even if you do scout it a lot of times its very hard to stop(see 1/1/1 or 7 gate or 4 gatewarpprism) 




 I wouldn't give up man. Remember you are going to be getting progressively stronger throughout the 90 days.  The first day I wasn't able to attempt ab ripper x either bc i was so tired from chest and back. What i did is slowly work my way into it. Week 1 i tried to do 5 of each move. Week 2 i tried to do 6 of each move, etc. My last abripperx on week 3(i'm on rest week now) I got through everything but mason twists. 




 that was a generic week...other weeks i'll add salmon or ground turkey. 




 me: 23 yr old 5'11" and 190 lbs

Tuesday: One Chicken breast and saute with one bell pepper(like fajitas!) Sprinkle low fat cheese on top and serve with vegi of choice.
Weds: Take one chicken breast, shred and mix with 1/4 cup bbq sauce(low sugar!). sprinkle with a little cheese. Place on top of wheat english muffins and bake for 10 minutes to make mini-chicken pizza's(2-3 english muffins cut in half should be fine)
Thursday:Remember that chicken chili? leftover time
Friday:cut remaining chicken breast in half. shred and serve on top of salad.
Saturday: Finish chicken chili at lunch. Other half chicken used in dinner of choice


combine this with a post workout proteinshake/recovery drink and you should be hitting 1900 calories per day and keeping pretty close to the 50% p, 30% c, 20%f suggested by P90x 




 I'm a big proponent of not stretching as i feel it actually tightens my muscles and makes me more prone to injury. I played basketball and soccer in high school and never stretched before or after games/practice because i always injured myself in game when i did. That being said...I just did X stretch and I feel WAY worse/tighter than i did coming into the workout. Should i just skip this "workout" or what? I don't feel like any good is coming of it 




 Did core synergistics last night and OMG! is that hard....way harder than plyo in my opinion. tonight is suppose to be kenpo but i'll be stopping by the hotel gym and getting my cardio on there for 45 minutes. 




 i only want a little bit of weight loss....more into gaining muscle mass. but yeah i under stand what you mean 




 Week 3 Day 6. No weight loss but a change in muscle/fat composition of my body. I went from having no upper body strength(not being able to do a negative pullup) to better upper body strength(I did 36 negatives last night during the course of legs/back.  I've always been told it takes 21 days to make a habit so i guess the people who drop off after week 2 lack motivation/personal drive(I know i did when i tried before!) 




 i'm doing my best to. Obviously i don't hit the percentages every day. I've been using loseit.com and have been averaging 45% protein 30% carbs 25% fat ...with some days the carbs and fat switching 




 I try to push myself as hard as I can and still be able to finish the workout. I've gone from not being able to do a single negative pullup on day 1 to doing 6 per a type on back days 




 Today is my Kenpo day for week 3 and I shall be doing it as soon as i get home. I've got to say that I'm a little discourage by lack of visible results. But hey...as Tony says "Rome was built in a day and neither was your body". I've spent the last 2 years gaining 25 lbs and a significant portion of body fat...can't expect it to fall off in 3 weeks. 




 no problem! My friend suggested it to me and she is a trainer so i take her at her word 




 I've started the program multiple times before and quit by the end of the first week every single time. However, this time I sort of just went "f*** it" and decided I AM doing this every single day for 90 days. So far I'm on day away for finishing week 3.

The thing for me is I mentally made the realization that this isn't a work out class. This isn't fitness 101. I'm doing this for me and no one else. I want my body to be back in the shape it was when i played basketball and soccer in highschool. I want that energy. I guess what i'm saying is that I know in the end all the work i put into it is going to pay off into the body i want. 

EDIT: I also told a lot of people who i keep in regular contact with so that i know i can't slack off 




 yay! just a small note...i notice you said dvd's. If you keep the dvd in then it automatically plays abripper x after your standard workout dvds(chest/back,arms, and legs are all this way at least) 




 Well it depends on what section you are on of the diet. I believe the amount of calories they have you using on each phase goes up. So if you are still on Fat Burner(which you probably shouldn't be on for long) then you will go up soon. Also, remember that p90x is more for lean muscle creation than bulking up.  




 i've played LoL and I dont understand whats going on at all other than tower kills and player kills. 




 Plyo sucks it sucks it really really sucks. lol 




 this sounds like one of those time where it is best to consult your doctor.  




 Today is my rest day of week 2 as well. I've gained 1 lb in the 2 weeks so no worries there. The way i've had it explained to me is that the weeks 5-8 are the weeks where  you really start to see results. This makes me excited bc i'm already starting to see my body slim down! 




 try to keep the diet better. Diet is actually more important than the exercise(ie you can lose weight on diet alone). What I do is find foods i like that are quick to make. My dinners tend to be: 

* Sunday: Cook a whole bunch of chicken breast(5). Eat one with some brocolli. Store rest in fridge.
* Monday: Take one chicken breast(precooked) and make a chicken chili with navy beans and garbanzo beans(this should leave a bunch of leftovers that you can eat on days you don't feel like cooking.
* Tuesday: One Chicken breast and saute with one bell pepper(like fajitas!) Sprinkle low fat cheese on top and serve with vegi of choice.
* Weds: Take one chicken breast, shred and mix with 1/4 cup bbq sauce(low sugar!). sprinkle with a little cheese. Place on top of wheat english muffins and bake for 10 minutes to make mini-chicken pizza's(2 english muffins cut in half should be fine)
* Thursday:Remember that chicken chili? leftover time
* Friday:cut remaining chicken breast in half. shred and serve on top of salad.
* Saturday: Finish chicken chili at lunch. Other half chicken used in dinner of choice
 




 instead of a yoga block i just use my pushup bars 




 i use fresh baby leaf spinach. its pretty easy to find and pretty cheap. Just store extra in my crisper 




 Yesterday i did leg/back and i was pretty sore this morning. During work i ended up having to climb 4 [strads](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Containerlift_straddle_carrier.jpg/220px-Containerlift_straddle_carrier.jpg) which are about 50-75 feet tall.

When i got home today i pushed play on Kenpo, broke a small sweat and then got to the kicks and stopped(boo on me!). How would you suggest i make it up? Try kenpo again tomorrow? Go running? Or do you think the climbing helps make up for that 30 minutes? 




 after. I do my workout late afternoon so i've already got some food in my belly. I think if you preferred to do it before that would be fine 




 no way. Looking through the ingredient list you should be able to see that its no bueno. It contains acai berry which everyone thought was this super fat burner but eventually research found it burned lean muscle! you definitely dont want that. Just go with a regular protein drink. Much cheaper! My protein drink is to blend a 1 scoop(or 2 on chest days) of protein powder, 1 banana, 1 handful spinach, 2 tbs peanut butter, 1/3 cup almond milk, and a handful ice. It tastes delicious! 




 Finished Legs and Back about an hour and half ago. I have worked out every day! Yay me! I also did decently at yoga yesterday...i felt like i did enough work to use a recovery drink. I'm not as sore as i expect to be. Not sure if this mean's i should go harder. I got another Gold's Gym spacesaver 25lb single so that i can try some heavier weights on the upper body workouts. 




 Kenpo can actually be one of the hardest exercises if you are willing to "bring it" . To make this exercise killer act like you are actually a mma fighter(i call this the Clay Guida). Stay on your toes and do small bounces during all moves. This will keep your leg muscles constantly twitching and will tire you quickly! super fun 




 oh most definitely....but if you are doing fat shredder(50% p, 30%c, 20%f) then that oatmeal basically kills all the carbs for the day 




 thanks for the lunch idea! i actually did that today and put it over a bed of spinach leafs. 

any other breakfast ideas? I find cottage cheese and hard boil eggs gag nasty. It also has to be something i can eat at my office desk. Today i switched out the oatmeal for a non fat vanilla yogurt and that helped a lot on carbs but not so much on protein 




 as a guy who played basketball all throughout highschool this posts pains me. I'm sure that practically basketballs may work. I would worry about it though because that much pressure on any basketball is sure to warp and misform it...and at that point you may be doing more harm than good. 




 there is a couple of us(well me and occasionally other people) posting our daily progress at [r/p90xlog](http://www.reddit.com/r/p90xlog/). You should do so as well! 




 the only problem/biggest problem with oatmeal is the high amount of carbs present 




 is it bad i'm not sure what day i'm on? I just finished week 2 day 3(aka biceps/shoulders/triceps.) I had my recovery drink and a piece of chicken for dinner....and my arms already feel recovered....I wonder if i'm not pushing enough 




 when i replied there was only one thread and it was the one at bottom with a whole bunch of people saying she didn't look different and basically being asses to her 
























 i've had success with ripit4me and dvd decryptor/encoder 




 is there a GPU monitoring software/benchmarking software that you would suggest? 




 Below is the build i did. Twice I have been playing a game and gotten to a particularly intense part and my speakers have put out two hard beeps and then my screen turns pink with some static. I have to reboot the pc to get out of this state. Any ideas on what I might need to look at?

EDIT: Did some googling and found suggestions that this may be an issue with the latest drivers and that falling back to driver v295.73 will fix. Will try out when i get home and update this thread. 




 haha thanks...since then i finished all 90 days and strarted insanity 




 question:best virus protection software? 




 yeah got it working this morning..i removed the front panel for installation and forgot to reconnect the power coupling to my power button :-/ And I cleaned up the cables i promise! 




 yeah i definitely did...but i forgot to take a pic afterwards 




 i had no desire to overclock...i only bought the 2500k bc it was cheaper. As for the radeon 7850, that would have put me over my $1000 budget so I had to stick with the 560 ti. Same with the H61. If my budget was higher i would have gone AsRock Gen3 MoBo as well 




 So my laptop started to go on me last week and [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/onylq.jpg) is the pc i built to replace it. This pic is taken pre-cable management. Thanks for all the help from BaPC, especially from Thenecron who reminded me last night that I can indeed plug in my Sata cables into the connectors when i started panicing. I installed all the drivers this morning but haven't gotten to do any performance measures yet.

 i dont think so..i placed the reset connector where i had the power connected and that allowed the system to power up....the system is running fine..just no power button on the case it seems. 




 i connected everything up and it seems that nothing will start.... any help on this one? i thought there was a guide for this 




 yeah like i said i feel dumb about it. thanks for the help...now to figure out all the other wires
 




 i understand where the sata2 and sata3 connectors are...I was just trying to figure out if there is any reason to use the sata2(since the have slower speeds)
 




 First time builder and i think i'm doing okay so far...I'm using a Lite-On iHAS124-04 DVD/CD Writer with a ASRock H61M/U3S3 Micro ATX LGA1155 Motherboard....i'm try to figure out how i determine whether i plug into Sata 2 or Sata 3...I feel dumb..any help? 




 insane...like plyo on steroids 




 they actually suggest a cool down period...i walked around and ran for two days before i decided i was done resting and hopped into insanity 




 but wasn't parting really low on money? i feel like they pointed out that he was broke right before the engagement...i agree that parting had probably won...but then again i remember thinking goswser had beaten mkp once and mkp came back via micro 




 from what i can tell its a giant pyramid scheme...that being said....there still is the possibility of being successful in it. 




 I bought windows 7 OEM and the packagin suggest using microsoft's OPK...I'm assuming that this isn't actually neccesary. Can someone confirm for me? 




 O.o mommy i'm scared lol 




 i did pay with credit card 




 you know this how? haha gold level terran 




 I placed a $375 order with ncix for my i5,a 2 Tb harddrive, and my case on thursday. I've called them twice since then and they say they are getting to my order and i should get an email soon. However, all the parts where in stock and i don't get why its taking so long(especially since on thursday they told me it would be processed by friday). Anyone else have issues getting stuff from them? 




 i go to walmart here and don't even bother with coupons etc. what i listed covers me dinner and breakfast. lunch's i buy some deli meat, some salad, and lite dressing. maybe additional $10? 




 you can basically get a 5 pack of chicken breast, some fresh/frozen veggies, some fresh/frozen fruits, eggs, and bread for $30 a week and it should feed youmost your meals. add some tuna/cans of soup for the other meals and you can easily stay under $35 a week. 




 i've shared my results pics enough around here. i dont want to karma whore too much :P 




 and I started Insanity yesterday....Plyo looks like cake now. 




 yeah the i5-2500 was more expensive so I said went with the cheaper(but yet overclockable 2500k) 




 First time trying to/thinking about buying a pc. I mainly want the pc to be able to play sc2/Lol at high framerates. It also needs to be able to handle live streaming in HD and coding work. Any tips on driving the price down a little?

 [official p90x nutrition guide](http://www.teambeachbody.com/home/-/dl_get_file/32ea4c06-2287-4660-8adc-8db758929d28 ) 




 please let me know how this does especially with Sc2. Right now my current rig can't process even on low and that means i can't get past gold league :(  




 find a calorie tracking website(like loseit.com) and use that. The general idea is that as long as you it fits the macros(50%protein, 25% carbs, 25% fat that you can eat whatever and it shouldn't matter much. 




 I modify one handed by placing my hand close to my body for balance instead of behind my back. kinda like over under pushups in Core Synergistic
 




 i understand..that plyo/yoga/legs days kills your legs. While i wouldn't stop leg and back days all together(you do want nice calfs/quads right?) I would say maybe every other week ish wouldn't kill you 




 yeah. The fog might mean you want to up your carb and/calorie count a little. Play with that and see if it helps. As for getting your but kicked I'm right there with you. The way I look at it now is that I'm stronger/more endurance so I can lift heavier and longer which means I'm not taking as many breaks in the beginning..hence butt getting kicked 




 you may want to kill the pasta...especially late at night....various studies have shown that its best to get all your carbs in by lunch so that more fat is burnt over night.(also there will be no carbs for your body to turn to fat) 




 i found the best way to prepare for p90x is to put on some workout clothes, grab a bottle of water and a towel, and finally pop the dvd in 




 since i know the moves by heart i turn off the video and just start doing them at my pace. It gives me my rest time and means i get all the reps out 




 my advice is to be asian, find someone to cut your hair like his......but seriously diet and lots of hard work 




 the thing that scares me as a meching terran is fast hive. You have to remember that i can't be spread out much...so you can easily expand all over the map and quick drone/tech
 




 forget about looks just for a second...are you stronger? Can you do more reps/higher weights. Since you didnt start out fat the changes are going to be harder to see so you really need to focus on the strength numbers. If you aren't improving there then THAT mean you aren't "bringing it" 




 I just bout the 90lb power blocks....but that a really good deal so i would go with it 




 gold level terran an occassional LoL player...would be willing. PM for character ID :) 




 If ALL you are looking for is losing weight I believe Insanity is your option. P90x focuses on lowering fat by increasing muscle. Also, 2 weeks is nothing! as a fellow ADD person i can tell you that you need to focus your thoughts elsewhere. If you do either completely you will get results. Also, p90x takes 90 days with most gains coming in the last 30 minutes and Insanity only takes 60 




 that sounds like a lot of carbs. Are you sticking to the 50% protein, 25% carbs, 25% fat macros suggested? 




 loseit.com 




 at the time i was in phase 1 i was 190 and depending on the protein bar/yogurt/sides/protein shake it would fluctuate. That being said I went back to my food logs and I was getting 170-235g a day 




 There should be a post in this thread showing my stats as far as working out..I played 2 hours of basketball a day in middle school/highschool. College I gained 50lb(135 to 190) and worked my butt to get back down to 175. I was back up to 200 before i started p90x...now at 180

EDIT: as for health wise...I'm a cardio monster bc of sports but lack(ed) upper  body strength
 




 Breakfast for week: nonfat Yogurt + protein bar OR oatmeal with banana..on weekends i'll cook 5 eggwhites and have two pieces wheat toast

Lunch for week: salad with turkey/ham( i keep a supply of spinach leafs, tomatoes, carrots, and turkey/ham from the deli in my work fridge) with some super low fat dressing(i use a honey mustard dressing i found at my local walmart)

DINNER for the week:

Sunday: Cook a whole bunch of chicken breast(5). Eat one with some brocolli. Store rest in fridge. Monday: Take one chicken breast(precooked) and make a chicken chili with navy beans and garbanzo beans(this should leave a bunch of leftovers that you can eat on days you don't feel like cooking. Tuesday: One Chicken breast and saute with one bell pepper(like fajitas!) Sprinkle low fat cheese on top and serve with vegi of choice. Weds: Take one chicken breast, shred and mix with 1/4 cup bbq sauce(low sugar!). sprinkle with a little cheese. Place on top of wheat english muffins and bake for 10 minutes to make mini-chicken pizza's(2-3 english muffins cut in half should be fine) Thursday:Remember that chicken chili? leftover time Friday:cut remaining chicken breast in half. shred and serve on top of salad. Saturday: Finish chicken chili at lunch. Other half chicken used in dinner of choice

combine this with a post workout proteinshake/recovery drink and you should be hitting 1900 calories per day and keeping pretty close to the 50% p, 25% c, 25%f suggested by P90x. When I get tired of chicken I'll change it up by having salmon or turkey italian sausage or a turkey burger. 









 Info of interests:

* Day1: 0 normal pushups(had to do on knees), 0 normal pullups(couldn't do a negative either), 15 lb curl for 12 reps
* Day 27: 20 High/low pushups(from core synergistics), 25 negative pullups, 25lb curl for 20 reps
* day 56: 30 pushups, 5 REAL PULLUPS!!!!, 25lb curl for 20 reps 









 hmm...honestly it felt like most the weekend. But some times i feel the same way about tastosis or Day9. I think if i had to verbalize it i would say this felt like you casting for Playhem(which i'll mention is awesome).  i just expect a slightly more serious cast out of MLG than i would out of Playhem.  Once again, Just my personal opinion on that one. I really feel the next step for you is getting comfortable in front of that camera so that when you come on stage at a big MLG, you'll fit in.

ALSO, you'd better watch out for Tumba's fiance talking about him like that.  




 Hey robin,

I thought over all you did really well especially when compared to Beta stream last year. If i could give some advice it would be

* i didn't mind the camera work but it did seem off and/or too frequent. When you do a zoom/rotation there needs to be meaning behind it(aka getting a better view of the action)
* you need to find a line in between joking caster robin and serious caster robin. I thought when you casted Korean qualifiers with JP you had it spot on...this weekend you seemed a little too "jokey"  but thats just my opinion
* you need to become less aware of the camera when you have a cocaster. During the finals when Tumba asked you a question you would speak to the camera with an occasional glimpse to him...it really should be the other way 




 i'm in america and getting crazy amount of lag at 240p 




 I would suggest trying to get some more protein from natural sources instead of bars/shakes personally but it seems okay...honestly using a site like loseit.com to track the calories your intaking  and the  macros 
would be best 




 also wanted to add that I did this by keeping 10ish almonds on my desk for when i get hungry.. 




 Hey I'm also on week 7(yesterday being my yoga day) and I added around 200 calories to my diet and it made me feel a ton better. You know what? it may diminish my results but I don't care because this is about making a change I can live with for the rest of my life..if my results are a little slower but I feel better than I think its worth the trade off :) 




 Speaking from experience, you can't just go in with the mind set of looking better would be nice...you need to go in with the mind set that "90 days from now you ARE going to be in such chiseled shape that your body will be like a gods". I love to cook...guess what i did? I took the principles of the p90x diet(50% protein, 25% carbs, 25% fat) and logged my meals in loseit.com and I cooked meals i thought i would like that still fit into that plan(Last night i made a delicious honey glazed salmon). 




 i'm a gold level terran(and i'd like to think my zerg is silver level) and i'd be willing to help.

test_subject4671.465 I'm normally on after 7pm EST 




 when i get a case of the blahs i try to substitute one of my workouts for another less formal workout...this usually looks like me replacing kenpo by going to the gym and playing basketball. changes up the routine a little which i'm all for 




 I had been struggling to hit 1900 calories and even though p90x suggested 2400 i thought i was doing well. I uped m caloric intake by 200 for a week and saw weight loss....so i would try adding a couple hundred calories for a week and see what happens...at the worst you gain a(single) lb and find out that its not the issue. 




 I'm going to a concert tonight...hopefully my plyo jumping will come into full affect tonight. Really starting to kill pullups and this make me happy. 




 I have the Gold's gym 25. They work really well when dropping weight but can be a little tedious if you are going up a weight...they work for what i need and were cheap. My only complaint is there light weight as i'm now reaching the point where i need heavier weights 




 i just don't like playing tvt there...i mean i dont like tvt in general...but any map where you can seige up on a ledge and kill me and i cant stop it i try to downvote 




 yesterday was back and biceps...i upped the weight on almost every bicep workout by at least 5 lbs. I really struggle with form here..using my back to get weights up instead of isolating my biceps. Today starts the stretch of the week i dislike the most (yoga, into legs, into cardio day) 




 week 6 Day 4 today. starting the section that really kills me..my legs are still sore from Plyo and I have yoga today, leg/back tomorrow, and then Basketball(which i replaced kenpo with)I haven't weighed myself in a couple weeks but i think i'm down 2 lbs last i checked. Significant strength gains though. 




 i downvoted antiga bc of close spawns and taldarim(doesn't suit my play style) 




 you are going to run out of space if you link to every day for the rest of the program ;)  




 this seems like carb overload...i don't know how you could meet the 50%,25%,25% with that much carbs unless you had nothing else with carbs in it the rest of the day 




 yeah when i took my post 4 week pics i actually could tell a major difference despite the consistent weight. So i'm not complaining. Week 6 now and going strong 




 i'm jealous of your core. two years ago i was killing ab ripper x every other day....this year i still haven't hit every single rep 




 i think the thing i notice most is the better posture. Yoga + strengthening in the back probably have helped a lot with that. Good Job 




 I did chest/tri/shoulders today. Must admit i really didn't feel like doing the workout. I went to the rivalry basketball game at my alma mater and we lost a heart breaker...I really wanted to eat pizza and drink beer afterwards...instead i came home, did my workout, had a cup of chocolate milk, cooked some chicken tenders, and had the tenders with a protein shake(I WAS REALLY low on calories today) 




 I don't know if you saw my results when i posted them last week but that is exactly what i've been doing using the program(lose belly, gain muscle). I personally eat a 1900(plus or minus 200) calorie diet using the 50% protein, 25% carb, 25% fat principles of the fat shredder. I use loseit.com to track my nutrients 




 you must not play either of those two races bc if you did you would know that the statement you made above is just not true. Zerg has to constantly set up flanks to creat good engagements and still lose half the time. Stutterstep is anything but bronze level friendly especially when you need to macro at the same time. 




 Good because we need protoss to be more of a HERP DERP 1-A race...must remember the new snipe will now effect TvP late game which was already craptastical 




 I believe D is used for wide grip. E F are probably just used for casual pull ups? idk about those two 




 there is a lot of angst against people who are already in decent shape so thats probably why the downvotes on the main reddit. Good job on starting, keep it up! Also don't be afraid to go to your knees to get more reps
