 That's interesting, I recently started playing this game and I've been watching their videos for a long time. So it was cool to find that little Easter egg  




 There's graffiti in the alley of the safe house from "The Creatures". I don't know if that's always been there, but I know they did that live stream not too long ago. 
Nova's and Sp00ns channels are spray painted on the wall saying one of them sucks.

 What is your favourite subreddit when nobody is looking? [NSFW] 





























 It's cold here, really cold here. 
I hold my breath when I go outside to start the car.  




 What's going on here?! 




 EDIT:  it's gonna cost 55$ on the spot to get it opened. 
Now I need to find 55$

 Everyone does great following the pro.

Pro lead everyone into the basement.

Everyone bags up every engine.

"What do we do now Mr.pro?"

"Have fun playing doctor you idiots"

Pro throws grenades at us and leaves. 

What an asshole. 

I proceed to lead the team. 

"Grab a bag boys"

I'm the only one who doesn't get knocked down so I take my engine to the helicopter. 

"Restart the game" everyone says

(It's a pro job)

Waiting feels like forever when I'm all alone. 

.......

..it's the right engine on the first try. Team goes bananas at my luck. 


Best feeling ever 












































 It probably knows it shouldn't have knocked over that bowl of glitter
