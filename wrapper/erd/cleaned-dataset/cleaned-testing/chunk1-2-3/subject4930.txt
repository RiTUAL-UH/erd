 A Siren with a blink ability like mages in wow. I think that could be fun if it was on a low cool down or had the potential to be with her skill tree 




 ATHENAAAA :D PLSSSSSSSSSSS 




 Could you do a Commandant Steele one? :DDDDDDD 




 any chance your friend can dupe me a wep and shield??? 




 so you're saying there are more to come? 




 im on PC unfortunately :( 




 im on PC and i did them on a lower level character because a high level friend helped me with the prove yourself mission 




 i'm ok with the grind i just dunno how to get my hands on a modded wep and shield . 




 A word of warning this is one hell of a grind, there are 3 arenas to beat, each with 20 rounds and each taking about 2 hours to complete, it's not for the faint hearted 




 yeah sure lets go :D thanks ^^ 




 I decided to get back into BL1 recently and have decided to get all the achievements, just for fun, however my lvl 61 roland save file seems to be corrupt or something, long story short, i leveled a siren, im now level 50 and have lost the will to live.

 However to get the achievement for killing Craw im gonna need to be level 61 or have someone carry me, so i was wondering if there are any kind souls out there willing to carry a level 50 noob to help me get the achievement? :P

 I want S S munitions to make a return 




 he asked which bosses could be farmed rapidly. Not what loot they drop... 




 Henry 




 we all know this...... doesnt mean the game inst going to ever happen. 




 "I'm an even better slut when i'm drunk"
 




 What does RNG mean? 




 Exactly why i dont spec into anarchy. Also cos i love using my infinity WAY too much 




 i'd rather no teleporting at all, and you have to ride your mount everywhere and face the challenges a long the way, it'd make the game longer and more challenging as well as adding to the RPG elements of the game and taking less away from the immersion  




 k 




 Mounts! Instead of the old catch a ride system i feel the ability to mount up at any time just like you can in WoW would be really awesome.

I feel like mounts like these could fit really well into the game and it offers more charater custimization if you give the player access to rare mount skins or just rare mounts etc.

 These are so awesome! Think i'll have to get the "my siren's name is brick" one :P 
























 because he's asleep and there's a limited number.... hence why i asked xD 




 can someone get me a code for my friend? says i cant get another one on the same IP and he's asleep right now, if anyone can help me out that's be awesome of you :D 









 that looks fucking dope. 




 poop.
 




 Anyone got a link to this unique TF build talk??? 




 What we really said when we all started: "That champ's OP!" 




 Master yi with feral flare here. Get on my level. 









 It says that vandal twitch is on sale: http://gyazo.com/25e2e09742e682d655ed6db51c3b5fe1
However when i view the "on sale" tab in the shop it says that gangsta twitch that's on sale, not vandal.

Im on EUW im not sure it this is the same for all servers. 




 You won! :) check your inbox 




 I can pay it off, it's no worries. Appreciate the concern though :) 




 Meh, i'd rather make someone happy. 




 I accidentally bought 1 too many game Keys for Reaper of souls (it put me in my overdraft and now im going to have to pay my bank a fortune .) anyways i figured i may as well brighten someone's day by giving away the key.

Just leave a comment and i'll randomly pick one of you guys :) Good luck!


EDIT: Jojobtz won! Thanks for entering guys, sorry i couldnt give you all one :/ 




 Im still waiting for an ARAM Team Builder, riot. 




 Really hope they fix the Zed ulti bug :/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UI3c3EY17o 




 Our clients all went black as soon as we got into champ select, anyone else had this problem? Now we get this :D http://i.gyazo.com/5ec486ee15fe51e096f570b8a3429ad2.png 




 i really feel like you shouldn't force us to pick what champion we'd like to play and instead allow us to just queue for the position we want so that it could be used for ranked draft pick. 




 I played 2 before i played 1 and i have to say it didn't really change much, i fell in love with BL2 and it was that that made me want to play BL1. The story is BL1 is SERIOUSLY BAD i learn almost nothing playing through the game and ended up googling most of it to piece the story together. So in conclusion play which ever you like first :) 




 Im down, add Fuzzy on steam :) 




 wouldnt this get me a VAC ban or something? is it legal basically? 




 Im sorry for your loss, i truly am :/ and yeah i agree the whole "it gets easier" shit people say is a bunch of bollocks, the highest suicide rates in america are white males above the age of 80 and people are saying it gets better!? That said I think you'll go far buddy, school was something i never did too well at, but keep studying hard if school is something you can deal with. 
























 I truly hope i never see flying mounts in WildStar. As a long time WoW player, before flying mounts were introduced, traveling was exciting! You had to be careful not to aggro mobs or perhaps fight your way through areas, you got to see other players along the way and see the monsters they were fighting, you had to meander your way through the environment and sometimes you'd discover hidden, tucked away NPCs and villages you never knew existed before. It made the game feel alive!

Once flying mounts were added the game felt so stale when traveling, you saw a few mountains and poorly rendered villages below that you quickly glided over in a straight line, trying to get from A to B in the fastest way possible. It was boring!

So please Carbine, never add flying mounts, keep traveling as fun as possible. 




 I feel like the questing would be amazing if they just added more voice acting, problem is that's expensive. Wonder if there are any voice actors who're fans of WildStar and would do it for free :P I know i certainly would. 




 but it still says ive got 15 wins 15 losses after a team builder game not like my 1500+ normal wins and losses :/ 




 source? 




 Riot said they'd change it this patch IIRC, but have they? 




 dunno my friend went to an all star party at some pub. Im from near Newport so dont really know much else on the matter. 




 There's even league events in Bristol :P 




 This is by far the easiest and most simpe tool, literally just press a button and it'll tell you your ping http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/19id2r/nifty_little_tool_to_check_your_ping_na_and_euw/ 




 Oh god i can see all the cosplayers that get WAY to into character being all like "EE KAA DOOO!!!!" 




 For a few patches now the mute button has been missing, it used to be next to the add friend/report/honor buttons but has since been removed. Why? 




 http://gyazo.com/db12f2b79980b6ed29b1c3c8681bb8c4 :D 




 same with annie's W which is find weird condering you can stop stuff like vel'koz's W 




 [/caitlyn] did i do it?

EDIT: fuck. 




 How the almighty shits do i lane as Yasuo? 




 As a Zed main i wish they'd fix the W + Q bug and the bug where he just stands still after using his ult 




 I added you on league and yet you're not on my friends list :( The unseen friend request is the loneliest. Y U DECLYN MI LUV? 




 The unseen Zed mains are the jealous...ist....? 




 I get accused of hacking when i play zed at least once a month. Because putting a fucking insane amount of practice into a champ cant be the reason you were able to kill me, you must be hacking! . 




 Anyone else had the annoying ult bug(?) where you're chancing an enemy and you go to cast your ult but because of the cast time you end up stopping, the enemy walks out of range and the ult never goes off, so end up stutter stepping? Has made me quite tempted to run move speed quints on her xD 




 What is OP is wrong, what if Gosu is actually Kaceytron? 




 Nah he's actually Kaceytron. 




 yeh something like that, but if i remeber correctly it's due to the dominion pros practicing on that day or something, so you get paired with super good players xD
