 I know it's stupid, but [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Licked_Hand) has changed the way I live my life (albeit in a very small way).
      

At night, my cat always props up on the side of the bed to bump his head against/lick my hand before jumping on the bed.  Ever since I became aware of this stupid legend, I have to turn on my phone's flashlight and shine it in his face before I am at ease.      

  
Not the way a 33-year-old, grown-ass man should be...but we all have our things, right?  Right?! 




 I've read a version of that before somewhere and let me tell you...I fucking hate it!  
  
Whenever my wife calls me from downstairs and I'm halfway down, that little thought pops into my head for some reason.  If I went towards her voice in the kitchen and then I heard her calling me from one of the upstairs rooms...I would probably shit myself right there. 




 There they are. 




 I think I have an idea of why it didn't work out. 




 Is your name Jake? 









 "...and I jizzed in my pants". 




 He choked himself on a chicken parm sandwich trying to imitate his idol, Peyton Manning.     
  
It's being ruled a suicide.  Insurance will not pay for that.  Sorry for your loss. 




 If I had that particular set of skills, I would have Butler pulling the Super Bowl trophy out of Sherman's chest.  
  
Sadly, I do not possess that ability and can only imagine it in my head.  It is glorious...and in HD!

 Technically true, but not when "fish   clits" is the first combination mentioned and "fish   chips" is the second. 




 Fish and Clits. Kinda like "fish and chips", but I wouldn't recommend ordering the former at a restaurant. 




 For me, I would have to say Super Troopers.  I wasn't expecting to see Farva's police baton.  
  
  
Edit: Should have taken out "the best" from the title, but I'll leave it.

 I came here from the same post...and found my brothers and sisters in arms. Subscribed as soon as I saw the title of the subreddit. Sad right? 




 "What do we pay you for?"

I'd hate to break it to them that all I do is surf Reddit all day unless someone can't turn on their monitor. Then I spring into action like a tiger...with no legs. 




 And that's where I live. South Cakalaka. 




 It's 55 until you reach a certain stretch of the highway, and then it drops to 45...and then back up to 55 once you leave that stretch.  For whatever reason, I have no idea. 




 Wow, I've never been that lucky.  Depending on the arresting officer, you could've been hauled away. 




 That first ticket would've been the property of the guy beside me, if I didn't have the stupid need to outrun everyone else on the road.
  
"Oh you want to be faster than me?  I DON'T THINK SO!" 




 Yeah, I was a little shocked that he would say something about my back window.  I obviously need to bone up on my tint laws in my area.  
  
I can see emergency lights just fine through all of my windows. 




 Just rear and side windows.  Nothing on the front. 




 I watched that loop for an uncomfortable amount of time...until I was comfortable with it. 




 Yeah. I think I would've been fine if I wasn't speeding. I've never been pulled over before just for dark windows and apparently I've been driving around with an expired tag for two months now with no issues. 




 15%.  I think the lowest it can be legally here is 25%. Not really sure. 




 ...within a ten minute window.

First one was 70 in a 45 on a highway. Got a ticket for that. In the same stop, I got a written warning about my expired tag and a verbal warning about my tinted windows. Gave him a "Thank you sir." and I was on my way home.

Second one was 83 in a 60 on the interstate. Got a verbal warning for that. Here's the kick...I also got a ticket for my expired tag and one for my tinted windows. I was contemplating on saying "Thank you sir, may I have another?", but I realized that would not end well for me.

Needless to say, my driving habits will be changing...along with my insurance premiums. 




 If he sent letters to all of the *owners*, I wonder who received it for the Packers. I'm guessing the top guy at Packers headquarters?

 And did she give birth in a bowling alley parking lot?  If not, I'm pretty sure that having a baby at a hospital is going to cost way more than $50. 




 Damn, I don't even like letting my *wife* hold my phone.  

Any way you can wipe it or lock it down remotely? 




 We start to slightly reposition and I attempt to slide my pants into her pants, but outside her underwear.

 I do this exact thing with all of my cords. Keeps it nice and neat. 




 I would let Aaron Rodgers touch my beard any time he wants, no homo.....eh, maybe a little homo.

 One character less than the "Infinity years" result gives me the result of "88 quadrillion nonagintillion years".

 One tip was the bike glitch thing...which I'm a little weary of doing. I don't want to get banned from playing online or anything over a stupid glitch. Is that possible?

Another was a single player tip to invest in the companies that Lester talks about before doing the assassinations...which I haven't done any of them yet.

And another was:
1. Make two character profiles.
2. Have one be like an "off shore" bank account.
3. Whatever money you earn with your main character, put into the bank.
4. Switch to the other character and have him withdraw it all into pocket cash.
5. Switch back to the main character, and if someone kills you, the "medical bill" doesn't get taken out of your bank account. 




 TL;DR

I'm the GTA V version of Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman...without the blowjobs and ALMOST getting raped by George Costanza.  




 On Xbox, I believe it's:

Back button  Inventory  Give Cash

I could be wrong, though.  




 50 Shades of GTA... 




 That's actually the first time in my entire life that I've used that term to say "vehicle"...and it will not be staying in my vocabulary. Didn't feel right.  




 After a survival mission, I got placed into a random session. With only me and another person in this session, I felt somewhat safe to go about my business (robbing stores, shooting random NPCs, taking pictures of bikini clad women on the beach).

Out of the blue, this guy sends me a text saying that we should team up. Being the paranoid person that this game has turned me into...I accept, but have my pistol out just in case. He rumbles up to my location in a fully modded Z Type. Seeing as I barely have $9K in the bank and haven't seen that car in game anywhere before...I was impressed.

He then proceeds to friend me, let me in his car, and then takes me to his $400K apartment. I felt like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman...only, you know...if Julia Roberts was a dude. Anyway, we get to his apartment and go into the garage, where he proceeds to show me his impressive array of whips, all modded out as well. We then spend the next 10-20 minutes, standing there just talking money strategies and general gameplay tactics. He told me a bunch of things that I didn't know and even offered to give me cash, but couldn't because the option was grayed out at the time being.

At the end of our rendezvous, he says he's going to go play CoD and to hit him up later for some general GTA fun. Right before he leaves he says, "Most people with a bounty on their head wouldn't be as trusting as you were.". At that point, I just remembered that I jacked an NPCs ride before the previous survival mission and he put a $5K bounty on my head. I had totally forgotten about it.

That was the absolute coolest experience that I've had with a random person in GTA:O! This game is awesome! 




 In the first part, after sinking the bit into the wall...why does she start making kissy faces towards the drill? 




 And she's using the same spoon to stir everything. 







































 What I meant by the proposed question was like:  
  
What if Rick died instead of Shane in the field?  What if Andrea got bitten, instead of Amy?  Carol, instead of T-Dog?  
  
They would still have the bonding over time, just as different people.
 




 Pardon the possibly bad grammar in the title - English is my first language.  Anywho...

Who would be in which role in the "new" group?  Where would they be?  Would they be a better group of hardened survivors than the group we have now? 




 Not knowing what kind of man he is, that could be a good choice...but looks can be deceiving, can't they? 




 Very well thought out and a good choice. Bravo. 




 Why? Because that's the question that I asked, mother dick. :) 




 Too soon, man.

It's a good thing my job doesn't have a revolving door entrance. I'd have a nervous breakdown as soon as I got in the middle. 




 Maybe freckledfuck can see a lot about a person just by looking at them. A hell of a lot, apparently... 
























 That gray shoe that comes in from the right at 01:56 has some serious grip.

 That's pretty fast for a reindeer. Usually they just hoof it.

 I'd like to do the same thing, but my wife doesn't like "comic movies", so I would have to do it all by me onesies.  Oy.  It sucks not having friends that are into comics and such as much as I am.

 Alexandra Daddario is the only reason I will watch this...when it comes out on Netflix in 2 years. 




 What would you do if your son was at home - crying all alone on the bedroom floor cause he's hungry - and the only way to feed him is to sleep with a man for a little bit of money?

 He was in Django Unchained? I don't remember that. 




 Actually, I just finished watching The Lazarus Effect. 









 That's why I said "probably".  Gotta cover my arse. ;)

 For me...cold weather school delays.  As a kid, that was the best news I could get in the morning while watching Bobby's World and eating strawberry poptarts.  Now as an adult, I have to make last minute plans to get my daughter to school and possibly be late to work if I have to end up taking her myself.  I can understand delays for snow and ice (I'm from SC), but today my daughter has a 2 hour delay...with dry roads, no snow, no sleet, and no ice anywhere. 

So why the delay?!  Are schools training our children to be a bunch of testicles that can't take the cold?  I'm just waiting for the day when she has a delay because the sun is too hot.

Maybe I feel like they're cutting her education short (over multiple "non-necessary" weather delays)...maybe I'm just bitter.  I don't have a delay for my job.  Meh. 









 Maybe she was looking at John Legend when Common was looking at her.  
  
Then again, he may have wondered what she was doing holding an invisible tray of food above her head and decided to skip that bullshit.

 How would you spread your persuasion throughout the world in only 24 hours, though? Webcam show, one by one, or try to jump in on a live broadcast? 




 And you wouldn't even need a million dollars. 




 I'll tell you the same thing I once told an *ex*-girlfriend:

I like it, but I think you could go...bigger. 




 Talk to the President and get him to push whatever you want through the system?

Oh wait, I think I know what you're talking about... 









 I stopped reading your comment after the word "place" and for a second there...I thought you were talking about me.

 Masturbating on Valentine's Day? Pathetic or not? 




 No lie, I have a version of that song in my car's mp3 player:

[I Can't Make You Love Me cover by Bon Iver](http://youtu.be/Q3VjaCy5gck)

You are definitely not the only one. Music has the capability of expressing what I'm feeling way more eloquently than what I could come up with. 




 At first, I got excited because my wife's name is also Janna...but then I realized she would never do anything like that for me. :(

Her Valentine's Day card would read more like...

"Just because it's Valentine's Day, that doesn't mean I'm going to touch you. Empty the trash." 




 :30 into the video is when the song starts.

All they would find would be a piece of my clothes, a small piece of my nose, and bone from my arm. 




 IMO, it depends on the degree of the accident.
  
Leaving vehicles involved in a traffic accident in the middle of the road (that could easily be moved to the side of the road) can cause traffic congestion and possibly another wreck down the line.  
  
If it's at all possible (car is capable of being moved, no one involved in the wreck is seriously injured, etc.)...it's a wise move to clear the road.

 Leslie Nielson was a serious actor before his role in Airplane!.  After that, he switched to comedy.  I could totally see Liam Neeson doing the same thing. 




 Me too. If they have their brights on, I won't flick mine to tell them...I just close my eyes and hope for the best. 
























 It sure did.  I mean, to see something with that much value in this world see it's demise in such a horrific way.

 How old is his daughter?  I think that if the weapon you use is underage, you can't be charged as an adult.

 A game of 500+ card pickup can be hell on the back.  Maybe she ruptured some nerves while bending over to pick them up and effectively paralyzed herself from the neck down.  Once paralyzed, she fell to the floor, only since she's paralyzed...she couldn't catch herself and hit her head on your night stand and broke her neck.

If the original comes on television at any time of the day, I will watch at least 10 minutes of it. 




 Actually, if you go to the movie first, that gives you a subject to talk about while you're having dinner.  Whether it was a good or bad movie, you can jump start a conversation by sharing opinions about the movie. 




 This one time, I put two on to protect my wien...oh wait..."condiment". 
  
Never mind. 




 Water boarding? 




 Hmmm.  Bristle end or handle end? 




 That sounds like a great way to go.  And now I'm hungry for a brownie. 




 You live by the keyboard and you die by the keyboard, I guess.

 Might be me just being weird, but that one made me laugh out loud.  Just thinking of how you could do that. 




 Don't worry, I won't.  That rabbit hole is too deep. 




 That sounds like it came straight from the game. 




 I'm bored. 









 Not just a Supra, but a white one. I think that has some kind of imagery behind it. 




 Yes, I am glad that I didn't. I don't want him to worry about something that I did to myself in the past. He has his own issues to deal with and I didn't feel like burdening him with one of mine.

And what you said last is something that I find to be very true now. Last night I found out that my friend has gone through the same exact situation I'm in now...only 8 years ago. After our talk last night, I realized that we have a lot more in common than I originally thought. 




 I'm going through a lot of shit right now (that I don't feel like divulging at the moment). I got a text from a friend asking if I wanted to join him for some drinks at a bar tonight. I said sure and a couple of hours in, we were having serious conversations about our lives.

I came really close to telling him about how the scar on my arm was from when I felt my life was in a tailspin and the pain from cutting was the only thing that I could actually control. As soon as I got ready to say it, I chickened out. I just couldn't imagine what one of my closest friends would think about me.

I don't cut anymore, but every time I sweat while playing basketball or working out...it becomes very visible. I guess that will be with me for the rest of my life.

There's no real point to this post. I just needed to get that out.

The sheep do not want the dog around. He looks too much like the wolf. He reminds them that danger lurks out there just beyond the relative safety of the fence.
  
The wolf also hates the dog. He knows that it is the dog that stands between him and his prey. It is because of the dog that he is lean. The dog is the reason the wolf is forced to stalk the darkness.
  
The dog knows these facts. Undeterred, he stands watch, ever ready to do battle. Despite that he is a welcome guest in their midst, the dog is ready at a moments notice, to give his life in defense of his flock. It is simply who he is.
