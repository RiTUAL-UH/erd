 Really? That's pretty awesome, is the story punchy and short? Thats what I like to see in an indie game, its certain;y the kind of game I want to make. 









 Enslaved? 




 You've reminded me I need to finish Skyward Sword 




 He had almost a Peanuts-style humour about him, strangely mature and insightful for such a youngling. 




 I completely forgot this character existed, seems like Tecmo Koei really love Twilight Princess. 




 already have, it's well made 




 Yes, but difficulty is usually a detriment to my experience. Let me explain. 

I like the idea of high difficulty, but it is rarely used with any great effect and instead of adding to the tone of a game, any sense of tension is deflated by the fact that while you may be vulnerable, your enemies are bullet/hit sponge demi gods.

I like the idea of getting hit once and dying, but I need my enemies to have the same vulnerability, otherwise it's an exercise in grinding and not tension. 

So instead, I often play on easy so enemies go down fast but reset to checkpoint if I get hit by a bullet, like a mentally enforced, pretend high tension difficulty mode.

It's annoying, because how hard is it to put in a difficulty mode where almost everything, including you, dies in one hit? 




 
He slaughters those guys in the bar and then uses that conspirator against King Foltest as bait for the striga.
In the games Geralt seems like he has more of a warm heart, does his character change in the books, or have the games made Geralt more sympathetic?
Don't get me wrong, the book is so far really awesome (got the audiobook), it's just interesting to compare and contrast.

 Morrowind is pretty great for that candy shop feeling. 




 I think it's fair for the devs to want to be secretive too though, it's more special if you don't understand the systems of a game when you first play it. 




 I hope this game isn't being overhyped by people on message boards. It definitely looks like a cool game, but I feel people need to temper expectations, so if it is mindblowing, it will be a nice surprise. 




 Very cool idea! Hope the world is super reactive. 




 So in this game, what are the limitations on freedom? I have never played Elite, but can you land on planets or other ships? Can you get out of your ship? Are any space sims like that?

Or is it mostly UI and flight? 




 I love listening to todd howard talk about game making. Dunno what it is. 




 https://www.youtube.com/user/PrescriptionPixel is a really cool indie game channel, I would love to know about more like this.

and

https://www.youtube.com/user/SonsOfVidya/ is two down to earth guys whose banter I find really funny and not forced. 




 I'm curious about relatively new/small gaming channels that people on /r/games think are really good or interesting.

I enjoy TB and Dodger but sometimes it's cool to see some less prominent talent on YouTube.

I'll post a couple I found down below, in the effort of fairness. Hope to see some good suggestions.

 This definitely looks interesting, I wonder if there will be a mod to change the camera in this game? I don't have anything against people enjoying isometric, but I like to see things up close generally. 




 This sounds excellent, hope to see more 60fps trailers and gameplay demos.  
























 oh cool! 




 it still fits, the squash banana is simba 




 The only thing I would want extra from this game is the ability to make my own character. Making a woman would be cool, for instance, but hey it looks rad anyway so yeh good luck to em. Can't wait to buy it :) 



















 Nice video! Will it be a 60 dollar purchase or subscription? 




 I've never looked into this game much, but can someone tell me if this is correct?

It will be a game where you buy and upgrade your space ship, you can leave your pilots seat at any time and board other ships or walk around space stations. You can use a gun and you can also land on planets (cutscene landing?)

If thats right that sounds really good, but will there be a story or is it more of an MMO experience type deal? 









 I've been to the U.S. and it really is full of lovely people. I think the american political system is horseshit and your social structure is unfair, but god damn, everyone I met over there was so friendly and kind. 









 I love PBS game show :) 









 Bethesda Harry Potter game would be amazing. Going to classes, learning spells, finding hogwarts secrets, having friends (companions) and all of that would be amazing. 




 I really hope they do voice acting in French with english subtitles, love French language :D 




 Looks really awesome, makes me want to go back to working on a proof of concept I did ages ago about a wild animal game:

 Corgi's are amazing! 









 Fear. 




 Writing is still important but its now become a first step for other mediums. Video content comes to mind (youtube videos like "explainers". Good speaking and imagery is important but the writing underneath is why people keep coming back. Edit: sorry, on mobile 




 sounds perfect, do you have a greenlight page? will probably get it

P.s. how did you get into games writing? I'm making my own games currently so I can get some experience writing stories for games. Did you do the same?
 




 Definitely would love to see a Bioshock game that tackles military interventionism, particularly given recent controversies surrounding drone strikes. It can really paint you into a corner when you start creating enemies as a consequence of trying to stop your enemies. If that can be intelligently critiqued I would be pretty stoked.

Along similar lines, I feel systems like the military industrial complex or the surveilance state would also be interesting issues. Metal Gear Solid has already addressed this pretty well already, though albeit in a completely different fashion to what Bioshock could do. 
























 HAHA Lemmings :P thats a decent point, shall be making nose smaller :) 




 Hey what about this do you think I'm joking about? Happy to answer any questions :) 




 This game looks great I can't wait to play it. 




 Haha yeah I always get mixed responses to my goofy art style, I've attempted to try something different and have posted it to the OP, lemme know what you think. 




 :P thanks, yeah these are concepts, not final versions :) the script will be proofed no worries :) 




 Ok fair call, might mess around with different art styles, see if I can use my limited skill with more efficacy. 

Thanks for the feedback :)

EDIT 2: Thankyou so much for all the feedback so far, I have revised the artstyle and altered the character design as people have suggested and this is where I am going:

Any feedback on the artstyle or idea is appreciated, just be aware that any feedback may be taken into account in the project, which means anything you post here could be used/appropriated - so if you have any ideas you think are too brilliant to give away for free please keep em to yourself and make your own game because I'd love to play it :)

Basically the game plays like a chose your own adventure/screen based game (maybe like visual novels? I dunno never played one), you have conversations with characters and decide where the plot goes by what the character does and what tale she ends up experiencing :)

I'm planning on having vastly different story threads depending on every choice you make, you could befriend someone or kill them :o - characters could betray you or you may never know their true motivations by the end. 

Because there are going to be a lot of panels, I've chosen a simple artstyle. I may also include a QTE decision system for high pressure moments, but it won't be anything complex, because I don't like complex QTEs.

Would you play this kind of game? 

Edit: wow! thanks for the comments, feedback and upvotes ^_^ 
 









 "War... War has changed..." vs. "War... War never changes..." It's almost like Kojima wrote that line to challenge the inherent view of our culture's tendency to fetishize violence and revere warriors as mythic things instead of seeing them as people who are mistreated by those in power. 

Nice observation! I like it. Good point. 




 Yeah it's kind of like Andy warhol, creating new art from pop culture. 




 I love how Kojima can use a wildly contrasting tone (camp 60's in this case) and still deliver a really serious and compelling criticism of war.

I love how MGS3 basically shows how soldiers are used and abused by governments for their own ends. There is no king and country bullshit here.

MGS is basically pop culture porn, but it is NOT war porn, something I appreciate greatly in the franchise and in a climate where MANY video games and even similar genres are playing up war as "cool" in a direct and shameless fashion - it's nice to see MGS actually having something to say about the shitty state of affairs our world has become. 




 sweet thanks! 




 I have two games in the works currently, the trailer for the first is a free one here (i took a break for a long while so ignore the release date lol)

The one I'm writing atm on the side is a graphic choose your own adventure type thing. ^_^

How about you? 




 Twine sounds amazing, is it free to use even if you sell your game? I just need it for the "screenplay" so to speak, not the game making, which I'm doing in Construct 2 




 This looks cool! 




 Traditional script writing software has been fine for my linear stories but how do I legibly construct a non linear narrative with different endings? A story tree writing solution would be immensely helpful so any suggestions? Preferably free options :) 









 The Thing is a singleplayer game where any of your team could be infected at any moment and attack you. You have to maintain their trust and if you think someone is turning you have to make hard decisions IIRC. Great game, haven't played it in years though. 




 Not surprised by the American news shows introduction emphasizing the money he makes to legitimize his past time, because money is everything...

not...

He looks like he enjoys his profession and thats the main thing - being happy and not hurting anyone in the process :]

 




 Wow love a new sci fi setting :) 




 Need to finish those Witcher books! Can't wait for this game.
