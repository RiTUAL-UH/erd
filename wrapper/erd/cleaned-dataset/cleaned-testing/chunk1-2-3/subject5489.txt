  Nope. I have heard of some terrible "get 'em any way you can" anecdotes (such as barring entry onto sports teams until they take a 'special bath'), but always within the context of such practices being morally reprehensible. We also have rules for potential converts, such as not baptising those who are underage without permission from their parents.

LOL Did you guys ask Ann Frank's parents before you tried baptizing her a bunch of times? 














 A flight going from Cairo to Johannesburg was about half-way through their trip. Out of the blue, the captain made a startling announcement,

"Folks, it seems as though we are having some engine troubles. Now please remain calm, and we'll have an update in 15 minutes."

Obviously everyone is freaking out. 15 minutes go by. Captain makes another announcement.

"Ok seems as though one of our engines has failed. We are going to make a landing at the nearest airstrip. We'll give you another update in 15 minutes."

People are still freaking out. Another 15 minutes go by. Captain makes his announcement.

"It seems as though the second engine has failed and we're losing altitude quickly. We will be throwing out the luggage to lighten our load. Hopefully this helps our situation."

Utter pandaemonium in the cabin. The captain's voice hushes the people.

"It seems as though we are still quickly losing altitude. We do have emergency parachutes, but only enough for a certain amount of passengers. Now to be fair, we will call upon passengers alphabetically. If your group is not called, then you will receive a parachute. Sound good?"

The passengers begrudgingly agree.

"Now, A, will all the Africans please raise your hand."

No one moves a muscle.

"Ok... B, will all the blacks please raise your hand."

Again, no one moves.

"Fine, C, will all the Coloreds raise your hand."

Still, no body raises their hands. 

A young boy, confused, looks around, and nudges his dad.

"Dad, dad, aren't we all of those?"

"Shhhh, son, quiet, we are Zulu." 




 Yea I know that about those pokemon, but they aren't Ghost type. Or zombie ants. 




 I want 3 pokemon, I want this [ant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camponotus) to be insect, and this [fungus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiocordyceps_unilateralis) to be ghost and grass. Now, since in nature, the fungus zombifies the ant, I want them to special evolve in to another pokemon that's like... ghost and insect. Better than Shedinja.

 Went to dog grooming school for about 600 hours of on job training. Make about 15 dollars an hour (commission, on a slow day). Essentially get to play with puppies all day. Lots of customer interaction. Make people and animals feel and look happy and healthy. Very respective of the LGBT community. Oh, and there's tips!

 When an animal is domesticated, infantilization occurs, just look at the [silver fox](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2010/09/06/mans-new-best-friend-a-forgotten-russian-experiment-in-fox-domestication/) of Russia.

 mocking, i wouldn't use that word. from what i understand, his argument is that phylogenetic trees like these are inappropriate models for dog breeds. the 2nd one addressed some of the issues with cross breeding, but still lacked complete accuracy. i'm going to go with what you said, in that i could be wrong as well.

edit: i'm sure these trees do have some scientific, if not artistic value. that's why i posted this blog, i thought they were beautiful trees.

Point being; is any wild land sacred in Southern California?! 









 Say that I'm 9 months sober for the first time in 9 years. 




 ^ Personally I'm part of that 9%, and 9 months sober. I really only got more in to the addiction aspect from smoking medical grade Colorado bud. I don't mean to rain on anyone's parade, as I am a huge fan of legalization. With legalization though should also come increased mental health awareness and possible drug/alcohol rehabilitation funding. Again, totally a fan of legalization, it just isn't for people with the addiction tendencies (here) or underlying mental health problems that are exacerbated by THC.

 I was in Costa Rica on a river boat tour, and our tour guide just randomly jumped out of the boat without explanation. He jumped from mangrove to mangrove, until he ran to a tree about a hundred meters away and proceeded to climb up the tree. He grabbed a branch, shimmied down, slowly made his way back to the boat. With him, was one of these [guys](http://cdn1.arkive.org/media/7C/7CD5F38B-EC21-4B40-8914-DCF40152145B/Presentation.Large/Pygmy-anteater-in-defensive-posture.jpg), and my love for the silky anteater began.

 I like his teddy bear cut, have you guys tried a diet change or any Angel's Eyes to get rid of the drool stains? I see it all the time and usually suggest those two things. As well as your groomer using the thinning shears to cut them out, but that's just slowing down the inevitable.  









 One of my first serious boyfriends I had. He was 7 years older than me, and my parents were already not thrilled about things. (I mean neither were his... I kind of forced him out of the closet when I would sleep over at his house and wake up with him, oops). So before my dad even got around to meeting my ex, my ex boyfriend sent me a picture of his gigantic penis to my phone. My dad happened to be cleaning, stubbled upon said penis picture on my phone, and proceeded to cuss me out and argue that i break up with him immediately. Yay!

 My father is jewish? So I'm no expert on this subject by any means. Any who... little story. I went on an exchange program to Bavaria in Southern Germany, where I 'attended' [Gymnaisum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(school) for two weeks (it was sweet, we got to go to whatever class we felt like that day). Well... one day i felt like going in to a history class. I didn't realize it at first, but after a few minutes, enough of the little german I knew clicked, and I realized I had walked in to a very in detail class discussion about the holocaust. I mean, man, they talked about things I didn't even know or think about. Ideology, methodology, specific locations, names/dates/times, etc. I was startled, but grateful the truth was out there for the next generation of germans.  




 'Africa' is over [50](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa#Post-colonial_Africa) separate and unique countries.

 I really am thankful for Allies such as yourself in the world. You really give a lot of strength to us LGBT people.

It's a bit outdated, to say the [least](http://www.glaad.org/reference/offensive). Again, thanks for that story, way cool. 




 That level of agnosticism is what I agree with. Especially if said meditation was [daily](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2008/10/relaxation.aspx) 




 I think bowing your head at the cafeteria, and having a classroom moment of silence, are two very different things. We do the Pledge of Alligiance, I think it should be followed by a minute of no conversation or noise. An opportunity for serenity.

 It depends on the state you live in, and whether that state has laws against owning, selling, or owning and selling them.
As a dog groomer myself, I tell my clients two places to find any animal:

 1) A Recognized and Established Breeder 

2) Shelter

Edit) Also, it depends what generation they are and how far removed they are from the serval in their blood line.

 Ok, so as a gay guy, I've actually thought about this a lot. 
As a child growing up, it's hard feeling comfortable in your own skin because everyone else around you seems so normal, and ironically being social and making close friendships with other guys, just makes you feel further alienated and alone. 
So the conversation, "I can change", "I can get cured", "This is happening for such and such reason", replay over and over again in your young, still developing brain.
Then the delusion sets in of, "Well, what if I woke up one morning, and *BAM*, I was only attracted to chicks." It's a sick fantasy I held on to, almost until I came out. 
My answer? I would of probably tried to make it national news, and get other people cured as well. Why let others suffer internally if there was a way out? If I could stop suicide, or drug and alcohol abuse, or a kid from becoming homeless or a prostitute?
Alas, now I'm out, and **proud as fuck**.

 Lol am I right though? Did you not play Gen 1 when it came out? 




 Ehrmahgawd you watched that video too 




 One could say the inverse, that younger fans don't appreciate Generation 1, because they didn't start playing until Generation 3. You make a bunch of valid points, it's just this video is satire. Not something to be Outrage(d) about. 




 Looks like $65 dollars to me. *cough* Sorry, had a bit of a dog groomer moment there. 









 Probably right, since most of the video relates to Generation 1.

Craig sat there sobbing. Throwing his fist at the ground. Screaming. Torrents of tears fell to the ground already splattered in blood.

"Oh my god Craig, we have to get you out of here. There's going to be cops, investigators, detectives, I mean our finger prints are over... wait. She wrote something. This bitch wrote something."

Don doesnt use my name, just keeps me locked up in this little cage all day and night while he fiddles with colonizers, mining for riches as I soil my cage.

My names Bethany; you should remember that, that and Ive been trafficked here for fucks and giggles.

Well, its been about 4 months since Don found me on a personal ad, drugged me, raped me, trapped me in a small box, and kept me in his work building on the Mars colony.

I only know where I am because of passerbys shooting the shit about the glories of space expansion.

No, I cant talk back, hes got a ball gag in my mouth, Don isnt that stupid.

I also know something thats quite interesting about the room Im trapped in, and that is that it contains quite a large amount of explosives.

I dont like to toot my own horn, but I know a thing or two about blowing buildings up to high heaven, in this case THE heavens.

During his last fuck-and-go, I managed to fiddle up a spare lighter from the sleaze bag's pocket and jam up my well, you get the point.

 Sorry you feel that way, just trying to educate someone with poor word choice on a public platform. We are equals.

 I wouldn't say the worst, because I'm so used to it by now, but anal gland excretion.  




 Also, 'homosexuality'. Here's a GLAAD [page](http://www.glaad.org/reference/offensive) that talks about that word as well. Internet can be educational too. Not just a place to perpetuate shitty vocabulary in the honor of 'tradition'. 




 I was grooming two [American Straffordshire Terriers](http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/images11/AmericanStaffordshireTerrierMountbrierfarms935without.jpg), really easy, just a basic bath, with some light brushing and a nail grind. Well I was grinding one of the dogs nails, and I looked away for a second to answer a coworkers question, and she didn't like me just holding up her paw. She growled for half a second and snapped her jaws about an inch from my face. I heard her teeth. Finished the nails quickly. Took a break immediately. Sat smoking a cigarette with my hands shaking like I had Parkinson's.

2) Hey,man, that's just like, your opinion.

3) Procreation and advanced societies don't necessarily correlate. "First World Countries" tend to have fewer babies, not more. More birth control, abortion, planned pregnancy. Essentially, people fucking in the butt.

4) First Nation Americans, Tahitians, Mesoamericans, Indians, I'm sure I'm missing a few others, but shoot, send me a message and i'll send you towards a whole bunch of historical websites on gay and transgendered relationships and social structures throughout history! Yay learning!

5) Try using the word gay. 'Homosexual' comes off as offensive. Makes me feel like I'm a monkey in a cage. But what do I know. I'm just a gay man in a straight man's world.

 Dachshunds bite the most. Siberian huskies that are well behaved are far and in-between (I have one myself, [Ki](http://imgur.com/a/Lihhr) who I usually have to muzzle when I work with him).

I have to say, I love working with miniature schnauzers, just not when it comes to their feet.

 I want a grooming van. No joke. I like my Jetta just fine.

Shelties are the shit! Make sure to find a good breeder, as recently, the breed standard has been for a narrow cranium, which has lead to a whole host of neurological disorders.

Other than that, need plenty of mental stimulation and exercise, basic to groom, just daily brushing, bath every few weeks.

 Hi Bill!
I grew up watching your shows in the classroom, and those shows helped blossom my interest in science throughout the years to such an extent! Thank you so much.
My question relates to extinct/endangered species and this current Holocene extinctionary period, and what we can do to prevent some of the loss.

I understand that certain institutions exist that preserve endangered and extinct animal DNA and bodily samples, such as [The Frozen Zoo at the San Diego Zoo](http://www.sandiegozooglobal.org/what_we_do_banking_genetic_resources/frozen_zoo/), with the hopes of maybe one day being able to recreate these species, such as what they did with the [Banteng](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Clone-of-endangered-species-succeeds-Angus-cow-2656880.php). You hear people talking about wanting to bring back the mammoth, or thylacine.

Some scientist, such as [Dr. Paul Martin](http://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Mammoths-Extinctions-Rewilding-Environments/dp/0520252438) actually wanted to sustain large numbers of ice age megafauna on the U.S. continent, brought in from other parts of the world.

My question is this: do you believe our resources are better spent conserving the life that currently exists on this planet, further preventing mass extinction? Are these ideas of resurrection too 'sic-fi' and farfetched to be beneficial in the name of biodiversity? 

Again, thank you so much for inspiring generations of kids around the country.
Cheers.

 A zebra, probably a Lybra, she was caught in my gaze

Like her distant cousin in pun, his starstruck.

Now a thirsty tiger like myself can't pass

A thick slice of that rump roast toasting in

My stomach by the moonlit sky on cocaine,

So of course I made one of those "Purrs you

Folk seem so interested, fascinated by; innocence.

That fat beast got on her fours and crawled

Towards the worst motherfucker in that place,

I proceded to lick my lips in anticipation, excitement.

Hours to the powers of infinite Algorithmic numerals

Passed by as I could taste that smooth red nectar,

That rotting smell in her nether region that enthralls,

Orchestrates the crowds to pull a Wagner Finale.

As my dead mother once snarled, "Patience, shithead.

And oh how she was so on the forehead! 

Seize the night!

I couldn't hold myself; claws extracted and my muscles

Pulsated in the direction of the flesh I was tearing off.

All I needed was a good grip, just the tip to tip the

Domino towards her larynx and esophageal passage.

Crush wouldn't even begin to describe the sounds that

Exuded out of her meat hole, snout flaring; fireworks.

I was bathing in showers of punctured pipelines giving

Oxygen not to her dying vivacarcass, but to my brain.

Puss, bile, feces, lymphatic fluids, bacteria I can't even say,

It all tasted like the best ecstasy I ever bought from a South Korean.

I mean honestly I'm surprised no one else said anything,

How embarrassing, there must of been sixty, seventy, other

Large Organisms in that same room, not to mention smaller

Non-invited creatons, protazoa, shit that can live for millennia.

I could of swore some of my saliva with that zebra's amniotic

Fluid got all over a Brown Hyena here for business, his markings

Only added to the stench of the carnaged carrion caf-carnival

(It's pretty much Lucifer meets your pretentious local French coffee place).

Some aardvark tried smelling up the flailing body, but I made it

Clear with my urine that my domience was in this territory.

And her breathing stopped.

Well someone had to break the ice, you know all those carnivores

Were in that kill from head to toe to tail to vestigial sense of empathy.

The plant eaters took the chance to sneak in some round two and three

Cud chewing, or in the various Rodentia, Lagamorph, anything else

Not so fucking flinty that I couldn't outrun a scary thought,

Whatever weed grows in the ever blood filled cracks in the grey

Cement layed on the backyard patio, I told him to do wood panels.

Everyone was in a feeding orgy, death brought life and some great

One on one on two on one on three beastial, primordial sexual

Encounters of the thirteenth kind, unlucky to the fallen soldier,

God Bless the flesh we are about to produce into skat, not rats.

But wait,

You are sitting on your pedestal thinking, "What a crazy tale, 

You corky, illmanered feline of an endangered speiciest deity.

You talk about death and violence like the weather, promotion,

Remotion from the motion you stir in our community, THE CHILDREN!

Sir, I'm pro-you-gonna-die, and that watermelon of a sense of morality

You're juggling on your head neglects one major factor.,

You can't run the jungle with out killing some fuckers.

Heads getting a roll, dinner plates go to my mate, you do you

And I'm gonna go ahead and do me while I finish this bitch Zebras

Blood covered tang smeared all across my nose;

CAN YOU SMELL THE FREEDOM? 









 I shared this with a friend. I told him it was sexuality in the modern age. He just said it was dark.

 So much for civil discourse.  




 They could implement dogs on to those farms. Such as the [Anatolian shepherd](http://www.dogwork.com/anatolian-shepherd-cheetah) that has been used in Botswana and South Africa to protect cattle and sheep from cheetahs. These are centuries old techniques that absolutely work.

Wolves were here first. We have to manage our resources responsively. That includes hunting, preservation, reintroduction, and capital gain from our biodiversity and ecosystems. 

As a hunter, think about it. Big game parks, all over the great plains. Coinciding with ranches, state, and national parks. Hunters benefit. Local economies benefit. Tourism benefits. It's a win win for everyone, when done correctly. 




 Can you cite a source? I've just never heard of humans successfully replacing natural predators, I could be wrong though.

Edit: And the reason to return these megafauna is to return (for example) the great plains to their natural state. Large animals eat large amounts of plants, which are hunted by large predators, which die off to feed large scavengers. All of which returns nutrients to the soil. VERY, VERY simplified. 

We also have fossil evidence to date a lot of those animals back as well. Pre-humans. As in 13,000 years ago. Not very long at all. 




 I'll bite. Care to elaborate? 









 If you're interested, [Dr. Martin](http://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Mammoths-Extinctions-Rewilding-Environments/dp/0520252438) did a lot of research in that exact field. RIP :( 









 I did send the mods a message, no reply, why was it removed? 




 Christopher Moore is someone you stop all books to read for, finish the book in two days, and realize you quote him more often than you'd like. *cough cough* Such as.

"I like my men like I like my tea. Green and weak."
 




 First off, yes, I'm getting him a 'omg, we're back together' gift. weird. But let's move on. And bare with me, book suggestions are needed.

A)

1: He's a fan of The Jungle Book movie, which is a pretty sweet animation. I just thought it'd be cute to go a step further and get him a first edition of the original, or a later edition with some age to it that he'd like. Maybe I'm thinking in the wrong direction. Any who, where a bouts could I find such a book for a good deal? In that same arena...

2: Disco Bloodbath by James St. James. Made impossible to find by Party Monster. We are a gay couple, and he's seen the movie and all it's horrific glory, and thought it'd be a sick find. I don't even know where I'd begin to find such a thing, and how much it's selling for. Is it too risky? Is the Jungle Book idea better? You tell me...

B) Scrap both of those ideas. Something philosophical? He was a philosophy major for awhile, and enjoys reading on the subject quite a bit. Very spiritual. Almost nihilistic. But I know for a fact he doesn't like pompous, or over the top eccentric language. Down to earth. Readable. Hopefully positive. I'm more of a 'tangible sciences' type of guy, so I really have no idea on what would be good. Help?

Overall, which idea do you like best, which is doable, and maybe what suggestions you might have.

Oh yea all online! 

Thanks r/booksuggestions!

 Dog hadn't been in in about 10 weeks. I believe the dog was a poodle, basically I knew the dog needed to come in. Called the woman. Told her how long it had been since the dog's last haircut. Told her we'd love to see Sir Barks-A-Lot back in the salon. She proceeded to call me a liar, that the dog had been in recently, and it hadn't been 10 weeks. This went on for about a minute, before i just told her, in my nicest most sincere voice, to have a wonderful day and hope to see you soon. 




 I'm a dog groomer, and sort of late to this one.

I've been grooming for around 2 years now, but when i started as an apprentice, my instructor wanted me to shave the hair out of a bulldog's pads (they have short hair, so this doesn't make sense, though i believe the dog stepped in something that gunked the hair together that the bath couldn't get out, I digress.) 

Well, I was doing my job, and as bulldogs normally do, he donkey kicked me. Except I had clippers in my hand. Well the clippers went flying. I fumbled them in the air for a few seconds while they were still running, and the clippers, just for a millisecond of a second, landed on the dog. They made a three inch line of no hair, on a dog that never needed to see clippers for a groom in its entire life (maybe a #50 or #60 blade for surgery prep, again, digressing.) Fortunately my instructor was cool about it, and explained it all to the owners, and took the blame herself. Could of been like a million times worse. But then again, I'm not sure the hair will grow back normally. Bulldogs are weird.

 Love Rhymes with a Hideous Car Wreck 




 This is kind of a weird coincidence. My boyfriend and I have been talking about jealousy a lot lately.

We broke up a few months ago, and got back together. My jealousy had a lot to do with it. I get pretty mad when he hangs out with his other gay friends. Especially older ones that are in open relationships. I've curbed it to some extent, because I know he loves me. I want him to have friends, and wants the same to me. I just can't help but say stupid shit and act like an envious, psychotic douchenozzle. Bleh. I'm *trying* to work on it.

 I'm not sure if this is a stereotype, but your gay friend growing up? He probably had a huge crush on you.

I'm gay and crushed on my best friends. I must have heard the same thing from most dudes I've dated. 




 Get a sulcatta tortoise! They basically eat the same stuff as rabbits. They poop once or twice a day. They need a bath once a week. And if you put them on your (untreated) lawn, they basically mow it/fertilize it. Here's my [baby](http://imgur.com/a/ZDS69#SBQumVB) 




 This made me sad to think about. Well... I got STD tested before I dated my first boyfriend at a christian testing center. We started dating, and then the results came back. It said I was HIV-1 positive. While I freaked out and got tested over and over again (even the state health department got involved), my boyfriend stayed by my side, well aware he might test positive as well. Every test came back negative, and I, understandably, lost my shit over the next 6 weeks. Finally, they were able to tell me I was negative. The whole thing of me losing my shit mentally, and this whole 'we both have HIV' thing threw a wrench in our relationship, so he broke up with me. Which I get. Completely. It was both of our first relationship and it was just totally fucked up by me. We've both moved on and done better and bigger things. 




 Oh my god that's so goddamn good. 




 This. This is what I was going to say. But we're gay, so it's different. (Or maybe we aren't different after all)

 The little koala



Our story begins deep within a forest that was big, tall, and smelled clean all the time. The sky was always blue and the sun was so hot you could cook an egg on a rock. The leaves were crunchy, and the birds were real loud. They sounded just like in the movies. What does this sound like to you?


On one of these big, clean smelling trees, slept a little koala. She was small and grey. Her eyes closed shut and she snored, sometimes itching her little back with her big koala claws. A parrot looking bird called a cockatoo landed right next to her and woke her up with the birds loud squawk.


When the little koala awoke, she wasnt happy. She was grumpy from her nap. She likes to sleep all the time. The little koala was now hungry and grumpy, and wanted to drink some milk from her mother, so she called out to her mother. It sounded like coo-coo.


She looked to the left. She then looked to the right. Her mother was no where to be seen. All she could see was that loud cockatoo that woke her up. She began to cry, because now she was grumpy, hungry, and sad. Where did her mother go? Didnt she know it was time for the little koala to eat?


The cockatoo looked at the little koala with curiosity. This made the little koala even more grumpy. The cockatoo came closer, and closer, and closer. The little koala swatted the bird with her big claws, but the bird wouldnt go away. Off in the distance, a bunch of odd sounds finally scared the bird away. They were coming closer!


Bark, bark, bark, bark, the little koala had never heard the sounds before. They were new sounds, and they were scary sounds. They were getting louder, too! The little koala started climbing up her tree, as far up as she could climb with her little koala claws. The animals that made the 'bark bark bark sound were close.


She was so scared! She closed her eyes real tight, and imagined her mother was holding her close. Nothing could get her if her mother was there. Just like that, the barking stopped, and the scary animals ran away. She was still scared, but glad they were gone. She started climbing back down the tree, when all of the sudden she was stuck in a net!


The little koala fell from the tree inside this net, and she scratched and scratched so she could get free. She used all the strength she had in her little koala claws, but nothing worked. She soon gently fell to the ground, and was surrounded by a tall blonde woman that smelled like flowers. The little koala began to cry.


The woman quickly wrapped the little koala in a blanket and held her close. The little koala was less scared.
Im sorry, little koala. You must be so scared. Lets get you some food and a nice place to sleep, away from those dogs. Everything is going to be alright.
The little koala felt a little better from the sweet sound of her voice.


Just like the woman had said, the little koala was safe with her. She was no longer grumpy, and she was no longer hungry. The little koala wasnt mad, and she was no longer scared. She had a new home, with lots of other little koala friends, and she could still climb the clean smelling trees and sleep, just like where our story began.

 It gets better once you don't test positive for THC, which could be a few weeks, or for me, a few months (I'm not fat, I'm big boned.... lol I'm not fat). 

Your symptoms of withdrawal will take about that amount of time. [Marijuana Anonymous' website](https://www.marijuana-anonymous.org) has a great section on what to expect with withdrawal. Some things i experienced? Mood swings, outburst, being thirsty, decreased then later increased appetite and weight gain, insomnia, paranoia, lethargy, believe it or not, these are normal. Your body is getting rid of THC, you will be weird. It looks like bipolar, schizophrenia, clinical insomnia, which you may or may not have, but you need to properly detox before getting the best diagnosis. Thank god I waited, cause I'm (mostly) good now and don't need medication for much of anything. 




 That's good man! I might even go a step farther though... It sounds cold as fuck, but friends that still smoke? I might just hangout with them less. Or if they do, let them know it can't be around you. For any reason. I mean I still have friends that smoke, just only a very select few. And they don't smoke around me. My boyfriend smokes as well. And I NEVER let him do it around me, he even keeps all his gear in a cabinet I don't go in to normally. What has happened, is that the people that smoke bud moved on. They didn't have a codependent in me, so they just found other people to blaze with. I'm better for it, they weren't real homies. Day.... 323 or something? I should probably know that. 




 I would love to see what else he could create, like an entire exhibit worth of material. Plus art has such a healing quality to it, I know when ever I'm upset or overloaded, I jam out on bass and my troubles evaporate. Not sure what he did to get to jail, but I hope he continues his craft. 




 I don't think a lot of people know what a cocker is. Or a doodle. Or a pom. Uhhhhh Maltipoo? I think people could guess that one. 









 Nanananananananananana... BAT DOG. 














 I feel real things. Motivation.... i'd say is pretty medium to low. Though that's my personality. I pray for my drive, and soak in social interaction. When it comes to work though, taking pride in doing a good job gets me through the day. I don't experience abnormal mood swings. I get startled, upset, mad, happy, excited, in very natural and steady ways. When I was detoxing I was a roller coaster. Interacting with me was like walking on egg shells. Today I'm mellow, and let things come at me as they are.  




 Drink tons of water. Herbal teas. Stay away from caffeine. Understand that symptoms of withdrawal are real, and will pass. They are mood swings, resembling bipolar and or depression disorder. Going on walks will become your best friend. Realize that you can only live day by day. Your goal is to not smoke JUST for today. You are not a fortune teller. You could pick up a joint tomorrow. But just for today, you won't. And that my dear friend, is amazing.

Guy, by the way.
Cheers. 









 He wasn't much to look at,

The ragged, mange'd tiger.

Let's just say the years took a toll.


The cat had a strip of forest,

Grandfathered in, gifted, with

The occasional sika fawn, food.


Moving forward wasn't an issue,

And survival was second nature

When cornered with a hunter's gun.


Though on each side of the land,

Were two other tigers' territories,

Neither aware of the other.


He knew both of them intimately,

One of lust, adventure, new beginnings,

The other of a boundless, philosophical depth.


To turn your head to the wind,

Was to smell the latter in memories,

Or the former in pure hormonal drive.


How can a beast be tamed to a decision?

How can a baffoon even think decisively?

How can a bundle of sticks catch a flame?


More importantly, and quite obviously, 

How did the fellow get to be so lucky

As to have to ask God on advice for love? 




 I think I know one of the [fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcastic_fringehead) that it was based off of. 




 Hey guys!

Well to start out, i first smoked pot when I was around 16, to get closer to friends I may or may not have had crushes on. Well music sort of replaced that, so I didn't smoke really until college, and I met more attractive people whom I wanted attention from!

Soon, it wasn't about friends, it was about feeding my monster (I'm the monster). Reisin tokes from pipes that weren't mine, stealing from friends, digging through my car carpet to look for little nugs, hitting up people to hook up with ONLY because I wanted to smoke (I think that counts as a form of prostitution?); I was a slob. I had this chick that worked at a clinic tell me I was on the lower end of the pot smoking pyramid. I agreed not knowing how right she actually was.

So I went to rehabs. 3. When I was 19 (outdoor wilderness... sweet), 21 (hospital?), and 22 (mostly heroin junkies there... fuck). Nothing worked. I seemed to get out, be sober for awhile, then just kind of meet up with certain people and it'd be back to square one. Well most recently, I was sober, working a great job, then just kind of got desperate. Met a stoner, moved across the country with him, and surprisingly (not surprisingly) my life turned to shit quickly. So I quit. I quit pot, quit him, moved back, and got my life back on track.

I've pissed off a lot of people in my life. I make amends when I can. I find prayer helps. Working. Being proud of my work. Dating has been considerably less stressful and oddly enough, people find me more attractive? Weird. It's also weird to look at that number. 320. A lot has happened in those days. First 2 months I was still basically a train wreck while I detoxed. I got over it with a good diet. But it just zoomed by. Life has gone by, with or without pot. Now I'm just aware of it. The haze has been lifted and I can exist within the days passing by.

So. Thanks for existing. Thanks for not smoking pot. And thanks for reading a little bit about myself that i don't normally get to share.

 I just bought my baby for $35 (I know, I know, Walmart sells it for $24.99, heard that from every girl in the salon), and I want to know how to best keep care of it, how long to charge it, how to get the battery to last longest, when to buy a new one; ANY tips you guys can dish. Thanks so much! :-* 




 Ok few things

1) I would always go the professional route, 10 lbs australian shepherd should only be about 50 bucks.

2) If I was absolutely strapped for cash (and wasn't a groomer), I wouldn't use clippers on the dog, especially a double coated dog like yours. The hair grows back badly, ruins the top coat. I would skim the butt area, where the most hair grows, with the clippers. I've used a 10, but you can make mistakes easily. If you don't want to make a mistake, use thinning sheers to make the butt area behind the back legs look uniformly rounded. Then, I would make the outline of the dog even (the back of the front legs, the chest, the undercarriage) with thinning sheers. It's a great, natural look. For the clippers, I would clean the anal area (one inch each side to make sure poop doesn't get stuck), the bottom of the paws (scooping out the hair gently), and that's about it. #10 blade, I use a #40 on the feet, don't do that. I would not shave this dog, and i would beg a client not to either. This is a brushing dog. Lots and lots of brushing. Make sure the dog is 100% dry before doing any of this, and clean 100%.

Edit: Tired of hand scissoring? Skim with a #10, just do it at your own risk. You may make holes.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Students who long ago got used to this, one to three grade boys to urinate, he will align the plastic bucket outside the classroom. School teacher, also acquiesced in such behavior, they will always remind the kids not to pee in a plastic bucket during cold sick. The children came obedient.

Dongyang in many people's eyes, with a boy in urine cooked eggs, spring tonic of choice. Boy selling eggs will always tell you, boy eat eggs, spring would not be sleepy, summer does not heat stroke. 
But to say this thing is going to fill a number, maybe the doctors would be more objective point.

In this regard, it is  Intangible Cultural Heritage Protection Center for  said that he collected information lad eggs and handed application. Finally, Dongyang folk art leadership team nine members unanimously adopted, after two weeks of publicity, Dongyang city government official under the document.

 *Brush them before getting groomed

Don't get a dog that needs brushed, if you won't brush them. Otherwise, we will have to shave them, brushing out a stranger's matted dog is animal abuse.

Edit: Daily. Brush long coated dogs daily.

 "Let's find ManBearPig!"

"Why don't we flip a coin?" 














 Used to live in Mission Viejo, I do freaking love that place. 




 I'm so glad people are killing and eating those destructive fuckers.

Edit: And it looks yummers. 




 Come a little north to Moorpark, we have one of the only release sites for Californian Condors at Sespe Condor Reserve. Great Hiking, out of the way from the smog. Then head west and see Point Mugu. 




 I think what the author was trying to say is that the gene pool is much larger than what a dog breed would be, and the development was extremely hands off compared to other artificially selected animals. Just flowery language, i guess?  




 I'm not a chick, bot.

 Since I am in to guys, and my post don't scream that I'm gay, I get a lot of thirsty guys messaging me. Here's some, this being from the app, [Whisper](http://imgur.com/a/Q4Cz1) 









 I think it's more of a figure of speech? It's not a very scientific source, but the facts are accurate.  




 I would get tribe of those freezing goats (I looked up that group name), and a bunch of Gampr to watch over my easily startled kids. 









 YOLO, his selfie,

Made Putin rage and binge drink,

"This fake, US snake." 




 I love that movie, just watched it again a few nights ago. 




 None of my posts were bullshit.

Edit: the Creative Grooming Association is a fine source. They aren't a giant corporation like McDonalds, that's not even comparable. Plus, a news paper article is another valid source. 




 This sounds like I'm talking to a college freshman holy shit. I work. I've been around the block. I work with dogs all the freaking time (also went to college). I don't know what your credentials are, doesn't sound like they're based in anything but trolling. I thought this was a cool groom. Doesn't hurt the dog. AND it has Nintendo characters on it. So cool. So I post it on r/gaming. My intention wasn't to argue with children. 




 By the way, I have countless dogs that come in to my salon EVERY SINGLE week. And they come in tails wagging, recognizing me and my coworkers. 




 You haven't brought any argument forward that it is animal abuse. These dogs do enjoy it, anecdotal evidence or not.

Side note, why am I talking to to a dude named 'PeeFarts' about logical arguments.

Edit: posting this twice because i will never support animal cruelty. people need to do a little research before they throw around such strong language about something they know little about. 




 [Here's some resources on to why it's not animal cruelty.](http://thenapcg.com/is-it-abuse/) 




 how do you figure? i've seen dogs that do it, they enjoy it. they're trained for it. 




 Shit is another name for meth. Ex: "Hey Jessica, got any shit?" "Fer sure, Angelica, I got some shit." 




 LOL, try telling a Taiwanese person that. 

"So... China is going to be build a road here. Now you guys will be closer than ever. Isn't that great?"

"Yeah... have you heard about the newly ok'd Great Wall of Taiwan? It's going to be so cool..." 




 idk about that, standard poodles are pretty well behaved, intelligent dogs. if they didn't stand still for this, they wouldn't have been picked to be used. the whole process takes weeks, usually in short sessions of an hour or two at a time. i think it's great, and the dogs get spoiled.

 Reminds me something Kesha would make. 




 Just saw the origin of the image below. This... makes me sad. 




 Aw... but I wanted to believe so hard... 




 Send it to a cyrpotozoological organization, who knows, you guys might have found something. I mean even Les Stroud is a believer. 




 O. 




 Oh, i'm not nice. But the 'community' is. And you're only more of a douchenozzle. 




 Nah r/creepy is actually really nice, lot of intelligent people on here. Just suggested you not repost stuff. And if you are reposting something, just deleting it seems to make sense. 




 It was 5 days ago I posted it, and I wouldn't be surprised if someone posted it before or after that. OP is a douchenozzle. 




 I kind of have to agree, you sort of do suck though. Just delete it. Do it. Do it. 




 You basically reposted the same thing, just dumbed it down.

 Puppies. Kittens. A cute guy's smile as I stare at his bulge. Yup. 




 Take a bowl, put in some flour. Put a one or two pinches of baking soda and salt, any spices you want like pepper or cumin, whatever. Mix it dry, then slowly add water. Slowly mixing it, until it is doughy, not running. You want to be able to knead it in your hands (having flour on your hands help not get them disgusting). Do it for like... 5-10 minutes? Then flatten it in to small patties. Put the patty away from the flame, but close enough that it gets cooked, and here's the kicker, right on the ashes. What?! But then I'm eating ash! No, you pat it away after the bread cooks, plus, a little ash never hurt anyone. It's awesome, amazing, and great to eat with beans, hummus, meat, whatever. 




 It's not confusion if they've come to terms with their identity. Heteronormative culture tells you because of your genitals at birth, you fit in this corner or that corner. That's what has people confused at a young age. Their brains tell them what society says is not true. That constant chastising of a person's personal gender identity, such as saying a woman is not a woman, because she happened to be born with a penis, is transphobia. With or without whatever genitals said person has, it's not your business, and it's not a determinate factor of that person's gender identity or sexuality. 




 Look up the game 'Mafia'. 'Candybar' is another really good game.

If you bring flour, some baking soda, some salt, you can make ash bread in the camp fire.

Cook food you like. Go shopping and freeze stuff if you must. No one likes to eat shitty food.

Layers are your best friend.

Please, please, please, please, follow a No-Trace with everyone. Come as you went. Pick up all trash. Don't disrupt the ecosystem (tearing apart trees and bushes for fire material, it takes a LONG time for them to grow back). Don't feed animals, ever. 




 Yes, I get it, but that's a ball buster for me, LGBT people are my homies, and I don't stand for transphobia. 




 Ok, hold the fuck up, you can't speak for what goes on in other peoples' heads. That's just stupid on so many levels. 




 ^ I'm a jew, and found myself saying the EXACT same thing the other day. 




 People having [silver foxes](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/03/domesticated_foxes_in_siberia_an_experiment_in_peril_.html) and [Red-Necked Wallabies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennets_Wallaby) as pets. Fuck micro pigs. 




 Religion, money, politics. So...

1) "Your entire belief system in a lie and you're doomed to (insert whatever)."

2) "I make more/less money than you, and am a better/more credible person."

3) "I won't think you're as intelligent as me if we don't share the same political view points." 




 ... I do that too. It's like, just growing up in the valley. 




 K. 




 Can we have some of your water? dreadful or not, we need it, my geraniums are super thirsty.
