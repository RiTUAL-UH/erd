 For me it's AC2/Brotherhood and Revelations. AC3 had some good tunes, however for me AC4 as largely unforgettable as I wasn't big into the sea shanties.  




 Dat scream....scared the living fuck out of me. 




 Executor: 1.1 billion credits then gets taken out by a lowly A-class starfighter, classic. 




 Is this the first time she has been topless in a role? 




 It was also titled [Star Wars Underworld](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Underworld) it seemed to have a pretty awesome premise. 

"Basically, it is like 'The Godfather'; its the Empire slowly building up its power base around the galaxy, what happens in Coruscant, which is the major capital, and its [about] a group of underground bosses who live there and control drugs, prostitution..."
Rick McCallum

Personally I think it would be an amazing on HBO if they put in a similar 10 episode season like they do with Game of Thrones with a similar budget as well, however the chances of that happening are nil since Disney own the ABC network which they would most likely produce it on. 




 Just curious OP but what exactly did you find a little offensive in this? 




 Look i'm sure that the production of ANY tv show is not "lazy" but don't you think in Australia  that all the free to air networks in Australia are over-saturated with reality tv shows? It seems like every network is just chasing after each other when one network has a successful reality show. Just my 2 cents as tv viewer. 




 Is there a guide for what kind of paper should be used when printing video game covers? 




 I actually think this would fit Ridley Scott perfectly, combined with a good screenplay of course *cough Prometheius cough*. If the film follows the first game and is set in the 12 century I feel that he could absolutely nail the look and feel of the setting as well as the sci fi elements. For reference I think people should check out the directors cut for Kingdom of Heaven as it is set roughly in the same time period as AC1 and gives a good vision for what he could achieve. 




 Recognise that yellow anywhere. 




 Serious question but how are you actually supposed to see out of the back? Does it have a series of cameras or are you just expected to never drive it on public roads and only take it to the track? 




 OP can you tell me what the pads you have under your wrists are called? 




 After coming from Titanfall to BF4, I have found myself getting caught on everything. 




 If they do it I hope they make it as unique as the [Tron Legacy Disney Castle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBN-Iolxa1o) was! 




 That's CNN for you. 




 Cheers mate much appreciated! 




 Any chance you could upload that tune somewhere for me to have a listen? 




 I was originally like you and asked myself whether the show would be too childish etc. Then I decided to watch it from season 1 to 6 and honestly it is fantastic. Sure there are a few dud episodes and some story arcs that appeal more to children than adults but the underlying theme of darkness is present throughout the series and man does it get dark especially in the latter seasons. Seriously do yourself a favour and watch it. 




 Looks kind of like a gigantic space jockey from Prometheus or Alien. 




 I have the same kit as well it's currently sitting on my shelf! Unfortunately though the stickers have been flaking off for some time now since I neglected it when I was young and I dont know if I would be able to get replacements :( 




 Apps are basically the same price as their US counterparts. I remember originally IOS apps being more expensive. A 99c app on the US store would cost $1.60, however in the last few years apps have gone down to 99c on the Aus store.  




 I just really hope they overhaul the entire free running system it just felt so dated and clumsy in AC4. It needs to feel and look more fluid as well as have a better sense of momentum when you are running. Other than that the other main improvements need to come in the form of A.I hopefully now that's only next gen they can improve the A.I due to higher memory.  




 I think of the ratings as more of a guideline. I was fortunate that my mum or dad didn't care about what I played too much and was able to get away with some pretty gnarly games at a young age. For example I got GTA 3 on PS2 when I was in Year 4 of primary school. I look back on it know as my parents being a bit naive but also as a sign of trust in that they raised me correctly and made me work for these games. I'm not saying that your mum is completely wrong in not getting you the game but I think showing that you can handle mature themes, ideas and concepts which transcend the idea of these artificial ratings, it will go along way with your mum. My 2 cents though I'm sure many people may disagree with me. 




 I actually quite enjoyed the theatrical version of the film when I saw it, even if I didn't quite understand the plot at times it kept me intrigued. I was curious if anyone has seen the directors cut and if that is the definitive version of the film? 




 Got 7 noms that year and didn't win a single one. 




 There was a lot of nice detail in this clip from the coffee swirling around in the cups to that guy lighting a cigarette almost had a very slight inglorious basterds feel to it. Of course the fact that they were speaking German was also a very nice touch. 




 He kind of looks like a character I would create in Oblivion or Skyrim. 




 It seems he went full retard.  




  Sony have already said that the price of the PS4 was not finalized until E3, and that they were prepared to sell it for less than they are in order to undercut the Xbox One, which was their ultimate goal from the start. When Microsoft announced their higher-than-expected pricing, Sony execs breathed a sigh of relief. This was all discussed numerous times in a wide variety of interviews with several Sony execs. The prices were not known to anyone outside of these two companies until the announcements were made.
 

I don't think Respawn chose to make it for the Xbox One as many developers with Respawn have stated that they are upset that PS4 owners won't be able to experience the game since they want it to reach as many households as possible. It was a very corporate decision to keep it to the Xbox One. 
 




 Even then would that cover the long term sales of lost game/dlc sales for the PS4? 




 Sorry but even MS will never pay a stupidly high amount for Titanfall 2. The only reason Titanfall 1 was a console exclusive was because a former EA executive thought the Xbox One would dominate this gen. EA are pretty much kicking themselves over this though since the PS4 now has the higher install base. So essentially MS would have to pay the equivalent of what EA are losing in potential PS4 sales and that would simply be too high for MS to pay. MS would most likely want to put that money into their own IP's such as Gears or Halo where they know they will get a substantial profit instead of splitting up the portion of these profits with another company like EA if they made Titanfall 2 




 While this wasn't the first game that got me into gaming, it was the first one that got me into RPG's. 




 Happening to me as well, so fucking annoying. When you want to watch a simple youtube video it fucking greys the screen asking if you want to use your G+ account, seriously G+ can fuck right off.  




 Does some of the score sound like it was taken from The Social Network film? 




 Looks like a Victoria plate in the pic unfortunately.  




 It didn't help that they showed all the episodes out of order AND kept having multiple breaks between episodes. 




 With that topic I would like to point people to the [Angels and Demons Teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7YrwBYezWM) which I thought was excellent.  




 Is it possible to get this as a 1080p wallpaper for my desktop? 




 I have heard that the majority of the film was cut down and it's easy to tell after viewing the film so I was wondering if anyone here had managed to see the full length version at any press screenings etc? If so did it hold up to the original film? 




 What about [The E3 2009 AC2 Walkthrough](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pIw4M4_ufI) this opening section was not even in the game and it looked really nice as well:/ 




 Which game in the series did you feel have the best soundtrack? In my opinion it's easily AC2 and perhaps Brotherhood. Jesper Kyd nailed the atmosphere and mood of the game in his soundtrack!  




 Otto is Otto backwards, whoa. 




 Yeah it was such a load of bullshit. Was there any specific reason as to why they just didn't use PSN? 




 Creating a Konami ID for the beta and then updating the game. Good times. 




 Man me too I actually put a decent time into the game but I sucked massively also I don't remember how the ranking worked in the game but was it just me or did it take a million years to actually rank up the skills in the game? 




 I enjoyed the movie for what it was however I did feel they overdid it on the slow mo. I also felt that the computer generated blood took me out of it a bit.  




 He has the look but I don't think he would be able to pull off the character though. I'd like to be proven otherwise though! 




 If this does happen I guarantee the ending will not test well and they will change it.  




 This is gonna be a weird one but for me it was Gattaca. It hit me hard for some reason because when growing up my brother was pretty much better at everything compared to me so the scenes of of Ethan Hawke's character striving to be better really hit home for me.  









 Do the lights on the case not become distracting when playing the game? 




 I'm not entirely surprised by this actually I flew back from Hong Kong to Sydney via Qantas airlines and the guy infront asked the steward if he could smoke a cigarette (this being after the countless reminders saying you can't). She gave a stern no and looked confused herself.  




 So basically a G-Diffuser is the only thing keeping the plane alive. 




 Odd I have never the old 7 series without the navigation unit inside.  




 Seems like they had kind of sobered up for the most part before burning the house down.  




 For those who don't know the original [Alien trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjLamj-b0I8) is what the Prometheus trailer was based off.  




 I was in the exact same situation mate a few days ago. In my opinion its best if you don't lock onto the dragon and get some distance. It basically has a tell for each move its gonna do when it lies down flat it basically means its gonna charge and when it does you can easily manouver around it and get a few hits in on the tail BUT you have to be cautious because you need your stamina to gain distance again when it starts bend over again. It has a move in which it will vomit up all this acid on the ground which can spread in a rather large radius but you as long as you are far away from him you can avoid it although if you get hit it will reduce weapon durability. You can tell when he's gonna do the acid move when he starts do this regurgitating animation from what I can remember. 

Basically just don't lock onto him and keep a lot of distance and monitor how he tries to attack you. It takes a while to get his HP down when you're only attacking his back side but it's the safest way imo.  




 Can the door operate individually to the roof? 




 I think the [Matrix Opening](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIXNpePYzZU) for me has the best WB logo. Just the music, sound effects and green colouring takes me back.  




 I wwebsite as on the internet when you were a sperm in your daddys balls and before it was the internet 




 I'm glad that I am not the only one who picked this up! I actually quite like this angle gave a nice soft look to that specific scene. 




 To be fair you would be surprised as to what the human body can endure in certain circumstances. It's not out of the complete realm of possibility for Shelby to have had a pulse but be completely unconscious.  




 In Australia it's subtitled as Rise of Electro. The trailers and posters they have in the cinema both have that subtitle.  




 True that it does seem like a pretty revolutionary car, curious to see if they would make an even faster variant of it, perhaps an i8M or Mi8 if that doesn't sound too silly haha. 




 My bad completely forgot about that one!
 




 Fantastic tune, cheers mate! 




 Did this episode remind anyone of The Last of Us? The raiders in the house acted very much like the hunters you face in the game, and when Rick takes down the guy in the bathroom it looked very reminiscent of something you would do in the game.   




 Now I understand that supercars are a very expensive investment which sees very little return, however the idea of BMW making a supercar which has their performance pedigree gets me wet to say the least. Perhaps something like [this concept](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18xpnwxs9ixyzjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg) 




 
Paris: "Yeah they like totally broke into my house".

Producers: "Thanks Paris we got what we needed to make the film now". 




 So does Mclaren actually not have a title sponsor for this year? I think the car looks fantastic without a bright contrasting sponsor plastered all over it like last year.  




 Also right hand drive.  




 Jiffy! 1:44-1:47 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn3PQJ9PHLY 




 I just love the fact that they actually use the phones properly in the show. They don't super impose some stupid interface that makes silly sounds over the phone to get their point across. Instead you get the real deal. I especially love the graphics they use on screen when the characters text each other.  




 I've been thinking his name was Beechum the whole time... I am not a smart man. 




 Apologies if this has been asked before but why didn't Michone take one of the vehicles left over after the Governors raid? She walked past a bright red Jeep that was on the grass in the prison I am assuming worked since it would have been driven there by one of the Governors people.  









 Ages ago when I was really young we went shopping so my older brother could get some new shoes, his eyes landed on a pair of Diesel brand shoes and my dad just says. "Why don't you buy unleaded?" 









 Hey guys so basically Netflix seems to lag in the browser mode when it hits HD resolution. It lags on both Firefox and Chrome bear in mind that I am using it through media hint on both browsers since it's not available in Australia. Is there anyway to fix this and also is there anyway to try it on Internet Explorer? 




 Hey guys so i'm travelling from Sydney, Australia to Hong Kong for four days, just for a bit of a break since I am finished with university and was wondering what are some fun things to check out in the little time I have besides shopping of course :) So any bars etc people recommend? 

Cheers! 



















 So I felt that while season 2 was great it came a bit too early. Season 2 felt like series finale material. This is how I would have arranged the seasons. 

Start off obviously with Season 1Season 3Season 5Season 4Season 6Season 7Season 2.

Now this is how I felt the order of the show could have gone assuming that certain characters did not die. Obviously Season 8 does not exist in this and you may be able to exclude season 5 from this order as well and pretend it never happened.  



















 I understand the press get to see the game-play etc behind closed doors and then they get to write about it, however to my knowledge have we ever seen game-play videos from a Rockstar game before its release? 









 When this film came out I was about 11 years old so obviously I wasn't really clued in what people thought about the film. I know this though that when I did see it in the cinemas with my parents, I cried and it is still the only live action film which had genuinely brought a tear to my eye from what I can remember. I obviously didn't get the underlying themes or motifs that the film conveyed at the time but after watching it recently at the ripe age of 21, I gotta say I am quite surprised at how many people dislike it, I didn't really notice how divisive the film was at its release. 

So what how do you fine people feel about A.I? Is it a masterpiece or is it one of Spielberg's missteps? 














 Basically are there any hidden gems around the harbour that not many people know about, maybe some rooftops etc to watch the NYE Fireworks? 

edit: unpopulated places to watch NYE Fireworks? 









 There were rumours that the film was going to be re-released in a limited run to remind the academy that this film exists, so hopefully it happens as I feel that it was really the surprise hit of the year for me, in my opinion.  




 Hi guys now first and foremost I am not a heavy drinker at all, I am only 21 and studying at university so I only drink heavy on occasion to celebrate or party etc, now I am not looking to make fun or offend anyone here but my main question is why do people turn to alcohol? The reason for this is alcohol in itself tastes pretty nasty in my opinion. As in spirits like Vodka, Whiskey and other hard liquors. Do you guys mix alcohol or just drink beer etc? This is purely out of curiosity I am not looking to berate or offend anyone here. I sincerely hope that those of you who do indeed suffer from an addiction to alcohol that you overcome it!

Edited for grammar. 




 Here is the [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTGC5Ot23KU) for those who are interested or need a refresher. Now this film was pretty much universally panned by critics and viewers alike, I just watched it last night and I am not so sure whether it deserves all the hate it got, granted it is by no means a fantastic film although it does have fantastic cinematography.  




 So I downloaded Lucid Rounds on the play store for my GNEX and was wondering how to use it, I open the app and it asks to download a zip file however nothing really happens after that. Once the download finishes I click the download in the notification tray and then nothing happens. Do I need a program to unzip it properly? 




 Do you guys feel that MGS2 is one of the more relevant games for our society/time?. With the underlying themes of digital censorship and the control of information, I feel that this game is even more relevant now than it was back when it released. 
 




 So with all the cool themes I am seeing in the /androidthemes subreddit, I was curious as to how you install these themes, sorry for being a complete retard, the most complex thing I have done to my phone is flashing the firmware to Yakju to get OTA updates.  




 Watched a horror film when I was really young, sometime in the mid 90s (the movie may have been reeleased prior) and it involved this female bride going turning into a monster and killing people. The only scene I vaguely remember was that of the bride walking along the side-walk and she comes across this kid playing a violin and then proceeds to kill him or injure him. Sorry that I cannot remember much of the film at all. It would be of great help to find the title of this film. Thanks.  









 Thought I would raise the question of films that were critically panned but had great posters. I'll start with Max Payne 

http://www.filmgrenade.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/max_payne_large_poster_2.jpg 




 Today I found a peanut butter that had expired at least 4 years ago, it had already been opened, suffice to say the contents were pretty gnarly. 




 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_tYaQVq4o 


































 So here is my pick for music that I play in EVE Online when I get the chance to play. This song just makes me feel like exploring infinitely which in turn coincides with what I love to do in EVE :D!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwGIogQWa5I 
























 I was in Year 11 at the time but apparently some kid in grade 8 or 9 at the time took a piss in some girls make up bag or pencil case (I can't remember) because she apparently took his phone one time and sent some rude texts to some other girl in the same grade.  




 Channel 10 here in Australia does the same thing, its annoying AND they show ads in the middle of the race! The saddest part is that the UK broadcast of the Australian GP is better than Channel 10. 




 They would make a considerable amount of money buy releasing an official season pass to watch the race live on their site or through various media devices e.g game consoles (ps4/3, xbox one/360), apple tv etc. Have various camera angles that you can choose from and show stats etc on the side. That would be my dream.  




 As someone who lives in Sydney, Australia I would love to see Sydney purely for the novelty of exploring a virtual version of your own city.  




 I think IGN would have come out strong if they didn't say "officially cancelled", had they just stated that it was a strong rumour then they would have been fine but I guess they put a lot of trust into this insider, enough to say it's been officially cancelled.  




 Does anyone have a strong feeling that is some kind of marketing buzz for TLG? By saying that the game is cancelled it will remind gamers that the game was being worked on and now with Sony saying it's not cancelled the game will be firmly in gamers minds leading up to E3 




 If that's the case they should just eat right imo. You can still lose weight by cutting out the junk in a diet.  




 holy shit i'm from Sydney but even then I have never seen a monstrosity such as that! 




 Yeah I can't really remember all my choices however I do know that I made some pretty crazy decisions at the end. I would love to see how they handle the characters.  




 What's the general cost to own a basic car in Hong Kong? 




 To be fair though we actually see progress in an MGS game, they don't get announced and then show nothing about it for a long time. FFXV was announced when I was in Year 9 in high school. I am now about to finish my university degree and we still know nothing about the game lol.  




 Have they stated officially whether the save files from Witcher 2 will carry over? It will be a big decision as to what platform I buy the game on.  




 I had one where the guards were in a search formation together and I hacked one explosive at which point he threw it against the wall next to him which killed himself and 2 other guys.  




 Is it possible to see what your npc model is? 




 They could just get Harry Gregson Williams. He does the score for the games and has done a ton of films as well.  




 Everytime someone mentions Arrow F1 I think of [this silly front wing](http://cdn.carthrottle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2001-Arrows-A22-2_2714056.jpg) they had on their car at one point.  




 The sad thing is that even if you recast him the performance would have been the same since it was the writing not the actor that delivered a fairly wooden performance.  




 Where is it stated that his memory isn't wiped? I always thought that both C3PO and R2 had their memories erased in the conclusion of episode 3. 




 I really hope it's a God of War game with a new protagonist and setting. I know a lot of people would love Norse mythology to be a primary setting for a new one.  




 I have a feeling they will focus it more on Battlefront and then give another small teaser for Mirrors Edge 2 since that game is on the backburner until Battlefront is done. I'm alright with that that though since BF4 didn't exactly have the best launch so I really hope they take their time with Mirrors Edge.  




 If that's true then what would the USA do? They have a much larger sporting crowd that watch their own homesports with a lot more money involved (NFL,NHL,MLB and NBA). 




 Can Japan and Korea host it again? Since they hosted it in 2002. Is there a specific time lapse before they are allowed to host it again? 




 One thing that throws me off his not having the controller vibrate when you get an incoming phone call. 




 Wait I totally forgot about this guy? They never revealed who it was did they? 




 I believe it was to keep it in tone with the sequels. They had a more heavier green tone compared to the first original release.  




 I didn't mean to undersell her. To be honest I've only seen her in maybe 2 films, Chicago and Down with Love haha. 




 DVD's will be region locked however most Blu Ray's will be region free. I'm Australian and have imported numerous Blu Ray's from America and they have all worked fine. But yeah with DVD's you will be SOL :( I use this site to make sure a specific Blu Ray will work 

http://regionfreemovies.com/

I get that the PS4 is way more expensive in NZ than it probably is in HK however I think for warranty reasons its best to buy locally.  




 She seemed to be the woman who was in every film at one point and she wasn't a terrible actress, at least I don't think so. What happened to her career? 




 The Insider 




 You could try the Hills District. I went to The Hills Grammar School in Kenthurst and the school was located within a fairly large forest. Perhaps you could ask them for permission to shoot there? 




 I really hope the story is better this time around. The whole undercover cop thing had a lot of potential but they didn't do much with it story wise and it got fairly predictable towards the end.  




 I don't think it would happen again since the last crossover forced MK to be T rated because DC didn't really enjoy their characters getting torn apart.  




 Can anyone tell me what the legality of exploring a place like this would be? Does the council own it or is it privately owned etc? 




 If you liked Oblivion you will love Tron Legacy, it's made by the same director, Joseph Kosinski. That soundtrack and visuals are perfect.  




 Yep I was 14 when this game was announced and in Year 9 now I am in my final semester of university. Jeez this game has taken its time haha. I don't think it could live up to any sort of hype right now.  




 Holy shit that is truly amazing. 




 It's not required on consoles, it just acts as a little store where you can purchase in game items with the points you get from playing the game.  




 I've always adored the Phantom such a shame to see one in this condition.  




 I believe this is the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioLQLRwTKS8) in question. 




 I was rather annoyed that we didn't really get to explore the meat of the city with citizens walking around etc. I remember they demoed a section of the game a few months before release and it had Nillin (I think that's her name) walking around the city with it being fairly occupied with citizens going about their daily business. 




 To quote the first Blade film I have always enjoyed the line: "Some motherfuckers are always trying to ice skate uphill" 




 holy shit that's insane. I saw the film but had no idea they used animatronics. Guess it was just that good! 




 My first time I got lucky and I just hid in a car on the side of the street parked next to other cars. He ran past me several times trying to find me. 




 Yeah down for me here in Australia as well 




 Hey do we have to preorder to get the DLC? 




 I feel that Star Wars: Underworld would be a good title as that's what the title for the planned live action tv series was based off. This is just me hoping that the Boba Fett film actually follows a darker, seedier tone seen in that original 1313 teaser.  




 I think you should check it out in my opinion it's definitely above average due to the fact that the characters are just so likeable and well written.  




 Yeah I have the game running on a 5.1 Surround mix and it's pretty abysmal, however if you run it through headphones it's a lot better.  




 Usually in engine cutscenes are of a higher resolution and polygon count when making the game and with the last generation of consoles (360,PS3) you would notice that the characters and environment etc would look a lot better than when you are actually playing the game. With the new consoles (PS4,XONE) this is not really an issue and they can get the game to look as good as its in game cutscenes. Hence why even though the trailer didn't show any true gameplay we can safely assume the game would look like that come release.  




 These all look like parody posters you would find in GTA or Seinfeld. 




 300, Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven (Directors Cut), Braveheart and I would also recommend Centurion which I enjoyed.  




 It was cancelled however if I were to speculate I would say that Viceral (makers of an unannounced Star Wars title) are retooling the game and maybe will announce it under a different name. 




 I thought they announced a while ago that it was pushed to 2015? 




 How much would it cost for Valve to resubmit the game for evaluation? Or is it free? 




 Man am I glad that this film wasn't about F1.  




 The PS4 cannot play locally stored audio files in game yet. You can use Music Unlimited which is Sony's version of Spotify to stream music in game while you play. I had created a playlist of my music and was playing it while in NFS Rivals at launch. But as of now you cannot listen to your own locally stored music while in game. 




 I imagine that they refocused their time onto GTA V and perhaps are making the game for PS4/XB1/PC? I doubt the game would be exclusive unless Sony ends up publishing but that seems rather unrealistic and doubtful in this current market. 




 As far as the state of New York is concerned you ARE the Assman. 




 It's just Maybach* haha and yes it had an electrochromic glass on the sunroof if I recall.  




 While RUSH (2013) sits on an 89% rating and 8.3 IMDB rating, I felt it was one of the films that sorely got overlooked especially during the Oscars. You don't even have to be an F1 fan to appreciate the film. Truly amazing in my opinion and Daniel Bruhl (Inglorious Basterds) kills it as Niki Lauda.  




 As someone who lives in Bella Vista, The Hills area in general is pretty chill, probably a lot more Christians in the population due to the advent of Hillsong Church which is kind of one of those youth mega churches you hear about in America. My uncle has a house in Castle Hill which is located on a street with other massive houses. His house was built in the 80s though so that street has old but massive houses which all border a fairly dense forest. The people are quite nice for the most part, definitely a welcome change compared to people around or near the city in my opinion.  




 I highly doubt there will be a teaser for TLOU shown. If the bolded parts of the leaks are true then I believe that they would show The Last Guardian at the very end of the conference kind of like a "but wait here's one more surprise" and boom they show The Last Guardian.  




 Amazing! 




 That's fucking retarded if that's true. Seriously he's a lawyer not a fucking bad ass super cop. Should have cast someone with less of a pull on the film.  




 Man of Steel felt like the closest thing to a real DBZ film. 




 This is such a fantastic show it really is in my top list. Great story which is now even more relevant in the whole recent NSA scandal which they tied in perfectly and fantastic characters.  




 Love the MP3 controls, seems like the kind of character that would want to listen to music while swinging around. 




 Auto updates and doesn't need the disc to update. All of my PS4 games are retail and I haven't had to put the disc in to update/complete the update of  game.  




 Australian citizen here, Jeep Cherokee's have always been quite popular here and I have also seen quite a few Chrysler 200's around. While the most common car you see here is a Holden Commodore (Chevy SS). Importing a Mustang, Corvette, Viper or Camaro is uber expensive as you have to get a RHD conversion and I imagine servicing the car would be stupidly expensive. Personally I love the designs of all 3 of those cars, it's just a shame they are so expensive.  




 So I have been rocking my Galaxy Nexus since 2011 and I want to upgrade to a Nex 5, is the battery life a substantial improvement over the GNex? Reason I am asking is that I know the battery life of the Nex 5 compared to some new phones such as the HTC One M8 and Galaxy S5 isn't the best but if it's a massive improvement over my G Nex it'll push me more towards it.  




 No, I have a 2013 328i with an M-Sport package and the only things that denote anything M-Related are the door sills, wheels and steering wheel. There is no external M badging on the body of the car.  




 I actually like this scene would have been nice if they remastered it and included it in the blu ray cut. Your score is excellent btw. 




 Glad that didn't happen it would have been too much in an already long film.  




 I use Xbox Music on my Surface Pro 2 and while I also have my entire iTunes library on the computer I mainly use it because the UI is a lot better + you can import your entire iTunes library into Xbox Music (at least on the sufrace). It pretty much functions like Spotify so I am just on the free account which lets me listen to pretty much anything except their are ads of course.  




 I like that this is a more contemporary looking UI compared to The Machine's UI, in a way it feels more threatening compared to The Machine. 




 Ohhh right wow haha didn't know that.  




 Wait what it's not my birthday though :( 




 I assume Cameras/Film/Music and PlayStation 




 Ben Afleck? 




 Anyway to view said videos on the PS4? E.g Can I copy a movie over and watch it on my PS4 yet? 




 Press X to chainsmoke. 




 Can't blame them, a dark period of fashion was fast approaching. 




 I wouldn't mind seeing some of the themes the Clone Wars explored, mainly being that grey area of dark and light. It raised very valid points about the Jedi order being power hungry and controlling in their own way. I think Knights of the Old Republic explored these themes extremely well through the character of Kreia. It made you look at the force in shades of gray rather than just pure black and white. 




 I'm afraid I haven't read that just yet but I plan to get on it very soon! 




 Supposedly the on hiatus/cancelled? tv show Star Wars Underworld was going to be based around a criminal underworld.

"Basically, it is like 'The Godfather'; its the Empire slowly building up its power base around the galaxy, what happens in Coruscant, which is the major capital, and its  about a group of underground bosses who live there and control drugs, prostitution..."
Rick McCallum

 




 Always liked [Dooku's](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/File:DookuSaber-MR.jpg) lightsaber purely just because it was very unconventional looking, compared to the ones seen in the films at least 




 Is the weather display on the main screen a US/Europe only thing? I don't think the Australian models do that here or have Connected Drive for that matter.  




 Probably the Matrix for me. Just really made me think bigger.  




 The marketing blitz for Episode 7 is gonna be some next level shit. 




 I like the BMW shifters. [Here](http://lifestylesdefined.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/BMW-I8-Key-Not-Just-A-Key-2.jpg) is the i8 shifter which is similar to current BMW shifters.  




 Hah here in Sydney if you look under 25 they will ask you for ID. I never get asked though and I am 22, the beard helps haha 




 I find that if you just grow a beard, wear a flannel shirt and jeans then you will be instantly cosplaying as joel forever.  




 I guess I would rather wait then have endless filler like DBZ. 




 Forgive me for doubting you but haven't they explicitly said the game will be released when it's ready, as in they haven't committed to a release date.   




 I really hope it's a new main character and cast, I would like to truly believe that Shepard's story is over. This is the kind of game that would really lend itself to next gen hardware.  




 After the Phantom Pain I hope he is able to step away from MGS and perhaps make a fully reimagined version of Snatcher or even a new IP.  




 Here's an [album](http://imgur.com/a/cNgMg) which contains screenshots  from GPU-Z and the catalyst control center which show the temperatures. Some followup I had restarted the PC which showed regular temperatures however the fan was still going into overdrive as you can see the RPM they are running at is stupidly high. 




 So my specs are:

CPU: i7 2600k 3.4ghz (not overclocked)
GPU: AMD Sapphire 6970 2gb (not overclocked)
HDD: Samsung SpinPoint F3 1TB HD103SJ	
PSU: Silverstone Strider Plus 600W ST60F-P	
MOBO: ASRock Z68 Extreme3 Gen3 Motherboard	
OS: Windows 7 Home Premium
RAM: G.Skill Ripjaws F3-12800CL9D-8GBRL 8GB (2x4GB) DDR3	

So basically everything was running fine until yesterday I decided to play some Titanfall then maybe a minute into the game the fan on my GPU went into overdrive it sounded like a jet engine. It has been doing it ever since now when I turn it on it goes into full overdrive and stays like that, GPU-Z said the fan was at 100% and the temperature was at -165 celsius, so something is defintely not right. Any help on what's going on would be much appreciated. 




 It looks like India, so yeah no helmets is standard.  




 For me it was Grim Fandango when I was younger, you had to get use the forklift in a moving elevator to stop it on a certain floor and I could never get it right.  




 Song: Enter One
Artist: Sol Seppy

for anyone curious.  




 Yeah he wasn't a bad bond by any means he was just dealt shitty scripts after Goldeneye. 




 This is a serious question and may sound really dumb but if one submits themselves into a psychiatric hospital do they have to pay for services etc after they leave?  




 Is FC4 reportedly set in the Himalayas? If true I really hope they bring in the wing suit for that shit. 




 Can they not put a different looking button though that performs the same function? 




 I imagine that generally a trophy where you have to get all multi-player unlocks or get the highest rank would be the rarest. In this case I feel a game like Tomb Raider or AC4 may have some of the rarest trophies since I can't imagine that too many people are playing those games online.  




 While it's more of a re-adaptation of the book I think Fincher's Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was much better than the Sweedish version.  




 That could be likely but SS was younger at the time and in peak condition compared to a Big Boss who was older and battle worn by the time of MG 2 




 Is it one of the Samsung Galaxy models? 




 Maybe this had already been pointed out but I noticed it for the first time at lest. In the Phantom Pain trailers where Snake is in the hospital it appears he is a lot skinnier and has lost a lot of muscle as a result of being in a coma and not being able to work out obviously. Just a small but nice detail that adds a lot to the character I think! 




 I'm assuming he is referring to Mark Webber who raced for Red Bull up until this year, he was known for having some pretty rotten luck on the track especially compared to his team-mate, Sebastian Vettell who is a 4 time world champion.  




 I was wondering why I saw Steve Irwin in my showing haha 
























 Can someone explain why The Simpsons isn't on any on demand service like Netflix? 




 I don't think so, at uni a lot of american exchange students seem to take a lot back home so i'm guessing they can't buy them there.  




 To be fair though Tim Tams are totally worth checking out. 




 Personally I really loved it because it was a more personal tale for Bond as it explored his history and childhood. A sentiment that is echoed in how M says "orphans make the best agents", which kind of makes you feel for Bond since he is a fairly cold and ruthless character.  




 The theatrical cut glosses over or completely cuts out many key characters that are integral to the actual story. The directors cut re-inserts this aspect into the film and adds layers to the developing world around the characters as well as political story threads which establish conflicts during the film. The directors cut is a 3 hour long film while the theatrical is around 2hrs 20 minutes, which gives you an idea of just how much was cut out.  




 Agree completely, the theatrical release of the film is completely different to the directors cut. 




 Was that scene even filmed? If it wasn't, would it even count as a deleted scene since it never existed to begin with? 




 Damn haha I had no idea! 




 Umm wouldn't a bike use less energy than walking or running, especially since you can just coast on a bike.  




 Hey bud try and list your other computer specs if you can!

Current CPU, GPU, Power Supply, RAM, Motherboard and of course what's your budget? 




 So is this one of the few big next gen games that actually hit its date without being delayed?  




 Looks like a set from Alien on board the ship Nostromo.  




 This one's easy!

[Moby-God Moving Over The Face of Waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3IXg8t8Ybs)

Used in the ending scene for Heat (1995). 




 You have been living a lie mate, 4th of Goblet of Fire directed by Mike Newell and the 5th is Order of the Phoenix, directed by David Yates.  




 So how's that RPG coming along?? 




 Well the game is pretty much dead here in Australia. You can only really get a game of attrition and that's in the evenings on weekdays and weekends. Any other mode you are SOL since the population is dead. Playing on the US and EU servers isn't an option since the pings are too high.  




 I imagine we won't hear a single thing about it once Witcher 3 is released. 




 It sucks for me, I live in Australia and the game is basically dead! You can most likely find a game of attrition in the evening on weekdays and weekends but want to play a different game mode? Tough luck and playing on different servers is not really a viable option due to the ping affecting gameplay :/ 




 Oddly enough I live in Australia and Avengers and Amazing Spiderman 2 both came out at least 2-3 weeks earlier than the US. 




 Have you actually seen any of the films? 









 These cars looked so cool that year, everything looked very experimental.  




 The assembly cut in my opinion actually makes it a much better film, while it still isn't as great as Alien or Aliens it is still a fascinating film since it continues the trend of each subsequent film having a drastically different tone. I think it's worth checking out especially for the cinematography which is truly amazing.  




 I always thought that the man on the balcony was hinted at being Ziegler. However there are many theories, even a theory that he may have been the main leader, the man in red.  




 Haha ah right, yeah VB may be iconic but it is not iconic for its taste, that's for sure! 




 Haha yep! 




 Why can't EA just put the DLC on Origin instead of running it through Bioware's website :/ 




 My favourite use of that smile is when he burnt Piers Morgan in the studio.  




 Really *VB?*.... 




 The Day The World Went Away by NIN - Terminator Salvation Trailer 




 Definitely Contagion. It seemed to handle the outbreak in a rather realistic manner especially when you compare it to a film like Outbreak where they end up chasing after a monkey in the forest for the cure.  




 This was actually pointed out to me by James Cameron in the directors commentary on the blu ray.   




 These pics should be cross posted to /r/WTF and copy and paste your text into the first post. You may get a lot more responses.  




 It actually reminded me of those weird fake adverts at the start of Metal Gear Solid 4.  




 Could be Australian like me where the average adult price for a movie is $17+ 




 I'm pretty sure he is the Santa Clause that stabs Simon Pegg's hand at the start of the film.  




 I feel that all the Euro cars get it as they have intuitive knobs for controlling all your music/nav while being able to keep focused on the road.  




 Anyone here think Hugh Jackman could play a great Joel? [Here](http://images.askmen.com/1200x600/video/entertainment-and-celebrities/hugh-jackman-prisoners-interview-1085204-TwoByOne.jpg) he is in Prisoners, which is what made me think he would make a great Joel. 




 I agree I enjoyed the film. To be fair though, Need for Speed is probably one of the easiest games to adapt into a film since none of the games really feature an in depth narrative with fleshed out characters that are remotely memorable. So in that regard NFS was extremely easy to pull off since you only need to feature fast cars and cops.  




 Fillion would have been great maybe 5 or 7 years ago but he looks a bit too old now for Drake.  




 Yeah he was a miscast for Prince of Persia  but I don't think he was the main problem with the film. 




 So that means it will probably be like $1000 dollars in Australia. 




 I was a boom operator for two short films during uni, nothing serious mind you but man my arms and back were wrecked by the end. It didn't help that the old guy we had as an actor kept forgetting his lines.  




 So in the aftermath of both MH370 and now MH17 will Malaysia Airlines be able to sustain these tragedies and keep moving forward or are they already on their way out and expected to go under soon? Just curious to hear your guys opinions.  




 Cautiously optimistic, Uncharted on paper seems like a very easy game to make into a film but a lot of these easy on paper ideas have fucked up so monumentally in the past. It will be interesting to see how the Warcraft film turns out in 2016 as that is also a big budget video game adaptation.  




 What's the song you used in this vid? 




 While it's not a video, I have to say the [Jonestown death tape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkookcrAnSE) is some creepy shit. Just knowing what was actively going down in that recording is way too fucked up.   




 The performance of a youngling.  














 As much as I disliked Age of Extinction (4th Transformers film) it is a lot easier to now tell who is fighting who when it comes to the transformers.  




 Cheers thanks mate
 




 Hey what is the wallpaper on your laptop? Is there a 1920x1080 version of it? 




 Yeah I'm in the same boat man, the game was obviously quite populated at launch and a month or 2 after then I stopped playing it for a few months and now when I wanted to get back into it I can't :(  









 Man I love the look and feel of all of Michael Mann's films. Especially Miami Vice, Collateral and Public Enemies. I felt it gives it a much more intimate feel with the viewer.  




 I always thought banks were pretty strict on copyrighted images etc being used on cards. Do they just not check I guess? 




 Hey guys so I came across these short films that bridge the 10 year gap between the Dawn of the Apes and Rise of the Apes film. They are actually very reminiscent of The Last of Us from the setting to the way they are shot. I feel you guys would really like them, they are also very well acted! 









 Yeah but the question is if it's actually interesting enough to be made into a film.  




 Hey OP what's the setup for that racing wheel? It looks quite nifty! 




 Australia, ping is usually 17ms 




 From what I understand, they were reviewing the bike and the journo just fucked up.  




 Does the game scale difficulty according to the amount of players? I haven't quite figured that out yet.  




 I did Day 3 of the Framing Frame for the first time with 3 buddies on very hard difficulty (stealth) and it took so many fucking tries to get it right. That stage I feel really depends on the placement of the items and layout of cameras. Although doing it stealth and getting all the gold is worth the effort as it nets a nice $590k. It can mentally break you though.  




 The upcoming film [Fury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q94n3eWOWXM list=PLYeOyMz9C9kYmnPHfw5-ItOxYBiMG4amq) starring Brad Pitt looks like it has some very good looking props and sets. 









 I hope so. I feel that Kojima would probably want to try something new as well but he is in the unfortunate position of Konami owning the IP and he is afraid they'll run it into the ground. I would love to see Kojima remake/re-adapt Snatcher for the modern era.  




 Man I would recognise that TV anywhere. Pioneer Kuro Plasma, one of the best! 




 My face is my warrant.  




 This trailer reminded me of the [Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk0PZMsk9ps) trailer. They have very similar looking aesthetics.  




 I have a strong feeling that it was a much cheaper effect to do the floating cubes than to have them actually transform.  




 Holy shit so this is my first time commenting on this sub and I think you perfectly described how I feel! I couldn't really put it into words until I read this, thank you. 




 I feel that makes owning a beamer even better if it's your weekend car, that way it feels extra special when you get to drive it! 




 I would recommend it as the driving in this game is pretty abysmal, I can't imagine what it would be like with a keyboard. Also combat is better suited to a controller imo. 




 Me too, I was more of a Sack Lunch kinda guy. 




 Shawshank Redemption for me.  




 For all the hate this car got it sure looks incredibly comfortable. How's the maintenance on this car OP? 




 It's on the *right* side. 




 As someone who has very hairy legs, is it worth it? 




 Any news on whether the UK/AUS release will be censored? 




 I think Media Hint isn't free anymore. Try using Hola Unblocker.  




 Hah I was wondering if this was Sydney, I felt the bus kind of gave it away even though it's blurry as hell. 




 Hahah yeah it does look like a ghetto interface, is it accurate?  




 OP what is home schooling like? How long do you get taught for per day? 




 She's actually smiling in this one! 




 Yeah almost all negative press about the film has been in regards to it's box office performance which is a shame because it's such a fantastic film.  




 Can that screen still display navigation? If so can it even be updated? 




 Does Sidwell still work for Tony? I thought he left to start up his own hedgefund. 




 Can we just talk about how unrealistic it is that Daft Punk would be having a concert.  




 Fuck me, if this is true that they are planning a trilogy in with Mass Effect style decision based choices then I am beyond stoked for this. DE:HR was one of my favourite games last gen and to see it return like this will blow my mind.  




 Hahah this where I first heard that scream! 




 From what I remember he was about to but they crashed and he was knocked out by the airbag, then waking up in the infirmary with another persons blood.  




 She said she could feel it, she felt that she had lost the power much like Cage said he had felt he lost it as well after the car crash.  




 I just checked the Ford AU site and it has this quote:

"There's a thrilling 5.0-litre V8 engine option available, but the real news is how we've unleashed Mustang-level performance from Ford's highly efficient 2.3L EcoBoost engine." 

Then it again it does say specifications will change closer to date.  




 So nothing like Batman then.  




 What kind of material are these made of? They look so weak but seem to do quite a bit of damage to someone. 




 We won't get the Mustang here in Aus though :( 




 She explains in the film that she bled out exactly like Cage did and when she woke up she had lost the power. She never said she died and lost it but that she bled out and had her blood replaced.  




 I think pretty much all these changes are for the best. The film ending can also be up for interpretation, while it isn't as directly sad as the book ending, it can still be sad in it's on way since film Cage may have almost fallen for Rita but due to the reset he realises that she wouldn't remember him nor fall for him.  




 When they tease the other 2 films at the end it really reminded me of the [teaser for The Matrix Reloaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-URQ4sMzBvA).  




 Splitscreen is very hard to develop into a game. It requires extensive coding and testing plus it would probably add a delay to a game. Personally the amount of people who would be using split screen would be minimal and thus the effort required for the amount of people that would use it is not worth it.  




 Hahah this is actually hilarious 




 Fuck I love elephants.  




 I wonder if the film would have done better in the US if they kept that title. While it may sound like a silly title it is catchy and doesn't sound as generic as edge of tomorrow.  




 Do you guys think Mel Gibson could make a career comeback? The last film I saw him in was Get The Gringo which, personally I loved. It seems that he really isn't getting any recognition because of some off screen incidents. Personally I would like to see him direct again.  




 Are you sure you don't mean A.I? 




 So I saw this for the first time a few weeks ago and I don't really know how to feel about this one. It seems like a fairly dry film but with some seemingly cool ideas and themes. The masked party in particular was very interesting and has that perfect mysterious air about the whole situation, however I just don't know how to feel about the film overall I felt kind of empty after watching it haha. What was the general consensus for this film, it being Stanley Kubricks last film as well.  




 Yeah I generally do shoot on manual mode and got some decent snaps I just didn't know you used the stock lens to get these shots! 




 I know that a lot of people didn't like the film but I have a feeling that The Counselor may get a cult following.  




 Why exactly do they owe Sony an exclusive game? 




 Well shit I have the exact same camera and lens haha it seems now I know what is capable of my camera.
