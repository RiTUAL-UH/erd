 I appreciate you taking the time to write.  She knows I wouldn't do anything with her friends.  I think it's more that she was really open with her friends (which she usually isn't) and it backfired.  So she's even more closed off now and feels super insecure and judged.  Most of her friends are trying to make her feel better about it all, but the few that she used to trust have ruined it.  I personally talked to each of the ones that were being forward with me and made it clear how I felt and whatnot.  One of them even went so far as to feel my crotch while we were talking and beg to see it.  Needless to say, she was a quick 'unfriend' on Facebook. 




 My girlfriend told all her friends how well-endowed I am, and now several of them are being creepy, hitting on me, and doing other things which are hurting our relationship.  She's usually very shy, hadn't been with another man before me, and told them during a friend's bachelorette party not thinking my size was that big of a deal.  Some sort of bacherlorette-based Truth or Dare game.  


She's really embarrassed now and thinks she's ruined the relationship with me and with her friends and questions her friendship with the girls that have been forward with me.  (I continue to tell her that she did nothing wrong and that the friends that are hitting on me cannot be her close friends if they continue to do this.  You cannot be friends with those you don't trust.)  I can tell it's really affecting her view of our relationship. 


Any suggestions on how to reassure her?  She's convinced she's ruined everything and feels really uncomfortable around her friends and doesn't always enjoy being affectionate with me anymore.

Edited for clarity.

 Yea, you hit upon several of my assumptions, especially the fact that she's likely to associate certain feeling of guilt with me no matter what.  So we'll see how it goes.  She's not the first girlfriend I've had an abusive childhood.  They always say they feel safe with me. 




 You're welcome and thank you.  Peace would be nice. 




 She seems to be improving.  It'll take time.  Thanks. 




 They're not repressed memories in the sense that the trauma was so great that her brain hid them away.  She just never dealt with the pain and emotions of the memories which swim through her head daily.

Just thought some of you might be curious as to what happened after my post.  After it seemed nothing else would help her feel better about what happened, she decided to use a counseling service through the university where she's working on her PhD.  (since it's a free service)  After a few weeks, the sessions began unearthing dormant issues of molestation and other terrible things from her childhood which the counselors are convinced are the reasons she has these debilitating feelings of guilt and shattered trust.  I encouraged her to focus on those issues without worrying about our relationship and we ended up going on a break.  I had suspected there might be something akin to molestation in her history, but I never brought it up.  Hopefully more counseling will help.

 Ha, confidence and swagger seem to be aphrodisiacs, yes.  I'm not worried about women who hit on me when they know I have a girlfriend.  I can swat away flies.  Just looking for ideas on how to make a shy girl feel less embarrassed. 




 Yea, but just a few of them.  And honestly, the ones that I couldn't understand why she was friends with.  Mostly girls from her high school days who she doesn't hang out with much anymore (or any now). 




 She was actually very proactive initially, messaging everyone trying to be light-hearted and underscoring that what she said was a secret just amongst friends, then I started getting messages from girls that weren't there. 




 The women that were forward with me would generally be the ones I assumed would be cheaters.  The ones that seems a little bit more selfish, narcissistic, and impulsive than the others.  Also virtually all of them already had significant others. Not a fantasy to have my girlfriend consider ending the relationship because of embarrassment. 




 I appreciate your words.  She lives off my reassurance, but the problem is she has to think about it every time we're intimate since my manhood reminds her of her guilt and mistrust in her friends. 




 The running joke with my girlfriends is that size doesn't matter but it certainly can't hurt... unless you're as big as me. 




 Grazie. 




 Yea, I'm confident things will return to a healthier level of comfort eventually.  I believe it also has much to do with how her public and private lives collided.  She feels exposed.  Just trying to see if there are other shy girls out there who can see things from her perspective and offer some ideas on what might help her see things less negatively.  (and also help her not be so PTSD-esque when she's being intimate with my manhood.  it stirs up memories of feeling betrayed by her friends) 




 It's actually a reoccurring problem.  Previous friends of previous girlfriends have tried to get me to have sex with them.  (Unsuccessfully.)  And the reverse has definitely happened a few times where male friends of mine (who obviously aren't friends of mine anymore) tried to get my then girlfriend to sleep with them.  It always seems to start with Facebook.  A friend of my girlfriend will friend me and occasionally IM me to see what's going on and start getting really chatty and friendly.  Perhaps I shouldn't list Secretary as one of my favorite films.  That seems to give them an icebreaker. 
























 When discussing his favorite films since he started directing, he said The Matrix was his favorite before he saw the sequels which 'ruined the mythology' for him.  I consider the sequels strangely sub-par films compared to the original but am curious what specifically do you think he meant by them ruining the mythology.


I'm looking for specific examples/themes/etc pertaining to the mythology set up by the first film.  Thanks!


Edit: Grammar/clarification.

Doesn't have to be school-related. Just something you did 'at school'.

 For kicks, here are the single frames between the cut..


[Before](http://i.imgur.com/qJEE7OP.jpg)


[After](http://i.imgur.com/JnL0yTk.jpg)


And here is a better angle of the bone a spin or so before the cut.. [Better angle](http://i.imgur.com/LfWFuRt.jpg)  ..Though obviously, the bone in this frame doesn't 'touch' the device.  The misaligned angle bone, so to speak, DOES 'touch' the device in the frame.  Perhaps this is one of the reasons it is used.


Also, notice the vertical antenna (or whatever it is) on the device just after the cut.  Curiously, it's slightly misaligned with its base.  In the next frame (and beyond), it's attached.  Here is the second frame after the cut..  [Second frame after cut](http://i.imgur.com/6iFjGxd.jpg)  ..Maybe a transfer issue with the DVD?  Unnoticed special effects flaw sort of like the helicopter blade shadows in The Shining? 




 As you can see, when you slow down the scene and/or watch it frame-by-frame, you can see the angles do not line up, which could have easily been done with a few less frames.  Since Kubrick was a known perfectionist and quite in control of every aspect of his films, it would seem he purposely ensured they were not lined up. (Perhaps to symbolize the road of technology was imperfect?)  What are your thoughts?

[First Followup](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/yz7nv/followup_im_the_guy_whose_girlfriend_told_her/)


Since there were so many questions and comments before, I thought I'd let you all know that we ended our relationship.  She's continuing with therapy.  After talking with me over several weeks, we've concluded that it's best if she is not intimate with men (for the foreseeable future).  She's always been bisexual, but becomes very anxious when thinking about intercourse with a man now, but says she still wants to be with me.  She thinks she can overcome the feelings she has when she's intimate with me, since she loves me.  Over time, I was able to convince her to move on.  She's been with women before, but hadn't really been consensually intimate with a man besides myself.  Her studies are improving now, and she's getting healthier.  We'll be fine.
