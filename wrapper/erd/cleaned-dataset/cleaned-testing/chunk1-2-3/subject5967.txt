 Should we spot start Lincecum for Hudson's next start? Best case scenario he just needs rest.  




 If we're going to be successful in the playoffs, Hudson is going to have to step up. Depending on how tonight goes, I'll either be feeling really good or really bad. 




 Nasty curveball. I ain't even mad.  




 Even she's tired of the Jeter circlejerk.  




 Even though you're right behind us in the WC standings, I can't bring myself to root against you. Hopefully we win the west and you guys can take care of the Dodgers.  




 Depends on what you want to do. For night life, the Gas Lamp, Pacific Beach and North Park are the main spots. The Gas Lamp is even cool during the day and it's within walking distance of PetCo. At night, it's a little showy, but a lot of fun. The trolley runs there, but it stops around 11:30. Pacific Beach is great at night too. It attracts a younger crowd, a lot of bros and hoes. Cabo Cantina will have more 21 year old girls than you'll ever see again in your life. You have to drive there though. North Park is the most laid back spot. It has a super hipster vibe. If you go here, be sure to check out Seven Grand and True North Tavern. 


During the day, I recommend visiting a brewery. San Diego has Stone, Green Flash, Mission, Ballast Point and a few others that I can't think of. I recommend Mission. Their Shipwreck IIPA is one of my favorite beers ever. Plus, you can take the trolley to 12th   Imperial, walk there and then either walk or trolley to the game.  




 Yeah, if you take the trolley it's pretty much an all day endeavour. You'll see more just staying in SD.  




 Curious what your plans are in Tijuana. I loved going there during college.  




 Because each of those fouls count as team fouls. Once a team gets 5 team fouls in a quarter, they will shoot free throws on all subsequent fouls, meaning that strategy will almost certainly result in other, better shooters shooting free throws.  




 Look at those fundamentals!  




 I thought I was in r/funny and your friend was [the only white person]( http://imgur.com/1939Q6h). 




 On one hand, I agree with you. NFL players aren't my role models and I don't look to them for moral guidance. On the other hand, I love watching the NFL mishandle these situations at every turn.  




 They played 4 games at LSU's stadium, 3 at the Alamodome and one at Giants Stadium.  




 This would have been an absolute heartbreaker to lose considering the Dodgers' result today. Now we're only 2 games back and feeling pretty good. I would much rather be heading to PetCo than Wrigley.  




 From San Diego or just visiting?  




 You mean Panda Frien...ooh.  




 What happens if the Giants either win the division or finish second in the wild card? Do you get a refund?  




 Dodgers scored a run. Why does that bother me so much?  




 What a weird week for the Dodgers. Lose 9-0 to us, come back the next day and win 17-0, and now they're losing 15-0 to the Rockies.  




 M M's with obstacles.  




 Runer at third. Batter strikes out on a ball in the dirt. Batter heads towards first. Susac throws runner out at first. Runner on third runs home.  




 This reminds me of one of JD Dorian's fantasies.  




 What happens in r/timlincecum stays in r/timlincecum.  




 No, no, it's "revved up like a douche in the middle of the night."  




 Gutierrez sniffing his hat... 




 This is awesome. I just drove past Raley Field last night. I would love to go to some games to see some future Giants. 


Also, Tony Torcato. That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.  




 Are the refs just quicker to throw flags this year? It seems like every game I've watched so far has had a lot of penalties. It really takes the life out of the game.  




 A lot of these penalties are legit, but it sure seems like the refs are quicker to throw flags this year. It really sucks the life out of a game.  




 That feeling when your outfielder dives for a ball and misses and you have to watch the batter run for days... 




 You know when you're playing RTTS and the pitcher you just created is getting rocked in his first AA game? That's how I feel right now, but I can't rage quit.  




 I really doubt it would have been overturned. It was too close.  




 It's not so bad. You get to win a World Series every couple years ;-) 




 Ugh...come on.  




 I think twice. Mixed results.  




 Gutierrez sniffing his hat... 




 I would call Bum's performance Kershaw-esque, but Kershaw usually gives up 1.67 runs/game.   




 Who holds the overall Giants single season strikeout record?  




 You just took the rivalry too far!  




 Get some garlic fries. They will turn around even the crappiest of nights.  




 Can someone summarize the story Vin told about Blanco? I'm up north and watching a different broadcast.  




 Unclinch!  




 Keep this troll at 0.  




 Just put in Brian Wilson already. That's who we really want.  




 [MRW I just spent a couple minutes in the Dodgers game thread.]( http://starsmedia.ign.com/stars/image/article/100/1000475/hero-showdown-cartman-vs-stewie-20090701022443845-000.jpg) 




 If you're in nor cal, it's 31. The guide says it's family feud, but it's actually the game.  




 [Oh, they mad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dodgers/comments/2g8ulp/game_chat_912_dodgers_8363_giants_8165_715_pm_pt/ckgvi6a) 




 YOU GET A DOUBLE! YOU GET A DOUBLE! EVERYONE GETS A DOUBLE!  




 Why can't I find the game on TV?  




 That's what happened. Jeff didn't have room for it at his temporary place, so he had Tony hang on to it.  




 I don't know if my nerves could handle it though.  




 For a starter to get a win he needs to:

1. Pitch at least 5 innings.
2. Leave the game with the lead. Had Vogey finished the 7th, he would be in line for the win because the Giants scored in the bottom of the inning. 
3. His team cannot give up the lead for the rest of the game.  




 Kid's huffing paint out of that finger.  




 Nope. Machi will get the win if the score holds.  




 Unclinch your bums, guys and gals!  




 [Pagan looking like he stepped right out of a telenovela.](http://i.imgur.com/YxXI9Yh.jpg) 




 Should have pushed it fair, jerk.  




 Looks freezing there. For once, I'm glad I'm not in the crowd.  




 We'll probably have to choose between Vogey and Peavy, which is an easy choice.  




 The biggest surprise of the address for me was the way the president talked about the Assad regime. He said the regime will never regain the legitimacy that they have lost. I don't necessarily disagree with that, but I'm surprised to hear the president write the regime off as a potential ally against ISIS.

Assad is in control of an entire air force, and what seems to be a more organized military than the rebels. I would not have been shocked to see the US reluctantly side with Assad in exchange for his assistance in going after ISIS. The language the President used tonight rules that possibility out.  




 The biggest change from what we've already been doing is we are now expanding the air strikes to Syria. 




 I'm just going on memory, so take this with a grain of salt, but he stated his plan to:


1. Begin air strikes in Syria.

2. Arm the enemies of ISIS, including moderate Syrian rebel groups.

3. Send 400+ more troops to Iraq in non-combat roles.  




 I'm sorry, but this just isn't correct. Just because they commit horrendous crimes doesn't mean they aren't religious. They certainly don't represent the majority of Muslims, but it's not accurate to say that they aren't religious. I think we can be mature enough to criticize a terrorist group without attacking an entire religion.  









 It just went final in San Francisco.  




 Padres now up 6-2 with a runner on 2nd with 1 out.  




 Joe Panik. So hot right now. Joe Panik.  




 Padres have runners on the corners with no outs.  




 Petit pitching like he has somewhere to be after the game.  




 They can have the MVP, we'll take the division.  




 I read that they are only ~5 games over .500 in games when Kershaw doesn't pitch. That's the best argument for Kershaw winning the MVP I've heard yet.  




 A Dodger fan in r/baseball summed up my exact thoughts about LA in a thread last night. They're winning games, but there's something not quite right about them. I think they're vulnerable and I wouldn't be surprised if they struggle in the final 3 weeks. 




 Panik is a stud.  




 Loved watching him play at Notre Dame. It's a shame his game didn't carry over into the NBA.  




 Najera?  




 Stole this idea from r/baseball. 


I'll start. Keon Clark. I just looked him up and last year he was sentenced to 8 years in prison for weapons charges. He also claims to have never played a game sober in his NBA career.  




 Finally, that city has something to be proud of other than a two ingredient sandwich and a fictional boxer. 




 I remember when Noah Lowry and Jerome Williams looked like they were both going to be studs for us.  




 A three quarter triangle? What an idiot. 




 One more touchdown and the Cowboys will cover the spread. With these refs, I wouldn't be surprised.  




 Week one and I'm already reminded what annoyed me about the NFL last year: Ticky tack penalties and so many commercials.  




 Geno is looking LEGIT! Surprise of the day so far.  




 Especially impressive considering he was batting in the .280s a month ago. He's been on another level lately.  




 The steak ends at 46 after a 1 out double. 


Mark Buehrle's ML record was set in 2009. The previous NL record of 41, which Petit also broke today, was set by Jim Barr in 1972. 
 




 I'm watching Parks and Rec and seeing how out of shape Chris Pratt is in season 1. That makes his recent transformation all the more impressive. Do you have a favorite actor/actress body transformation?  




 I know, I know I hate posts here where OP makes excuses too.

I'm staying at my parents' house for a few months. My dad has a bench. So, I can do bench, DLs, rows. He also has dumbbells and a pullup bar, so I can do dumbbell press and pullups. Everything I need to build a strong upper body is there. The problem is, he doesn't have a way to safely squat. The only thing he has for lower body is a leg extension/leg curl machine attached to the bench. 

What kind of results can I expect to my lower body if I combine that with dumbbel lunges? Are there any other lower body exercises I can do with the equipment I have?  




 It seems like the general consensus around here is that deadlifts are the single best lift you can do. I'm wondering what your body would look like if you only did deadlifts. 



















 I thought it would be a good idea if, once a week, we had a weekly discussion thread where we could discuss anything.

My question to you: What sporting events do you have your eyes on over the MLB all-star break? 

I ended the first half of the season with a perfect day, betting on SF, CIN, TB, ATL and LAA. Nothing like having a perfect day and then not having baseball for the next few days.

What's on your mind this week? 









 I'm reading *The Master and Margarita* right now. I'm only about half way through, but I think Woland should be played by Johnny Depp in a role similar to Willy Wonka or Jack Sparrow; obviously intelligent, but a little spacey, although you're never quite sure if it's an act or not.  Ivan would be played by a younger actor. Maybe someone like Heath Ledger.  




 There was a thread recently about classics that have not aged well and I'm curious about the opposite. What classic books have aged well? 









 I just read it for the first time and while it was a decent story, it didn't strike me as exceptional in any way. Why is it so famous almost 100 years after it was written? 









 I just landed this morning and immediately did the Freedom Trail. I'll be here until Thursday night and I'm looking for suggestions from locals for activities to do. I definitely want to catch a game at Fenway either tonight or tomorrow. I also want to go to a brewery. I know Sam Adams is the famous one, but I've heard good things about Harpoon. What else do you recommend I do? 









 I have always wanted to do this and I'll probably never get a better chance to do it than next month. I had some travel plans with a friend that fell through, so I have a week off work. More importantly, I can fly for free or nearly free through a family member who works for an airline. If you've done it before, what was your experience like? What advice can you share? 




 Right now I weigh 165 lbs @ 5'10". I included lifts at 3 different weights: 135, 185, 200. Just want to make sure I'm not headed towards a preventable injury. Please take a look and let me know how I can improve.

 I'm constantly wondering how I'm going to get my next meal. I wake up in the morning and I try to remember how much food is in the house. How much milk do I have and is it enough to make it through the day? When will I find time to go to the store today to get more milk for tomorrow? Did I remember to wash my blender last night? Is today lifting day? I think about how many calories I need to have consumed by the time I leave for work, because I know I will be too tired to cook a big meal when I come home. I don't want to be hungry at work, but I also don't want protein farts. I lay in bed browsing reddit on my phone, but I know I should be eating.

If I start to feel hungry at work, I fret over the gains I'm losing. I count the minutes until I can take my break and find some food. But I only have 15 minutes. I run to Starbucks and hope they have breakfast sandwiches left. That will have to hold me over for the rest of my shift. 


I come home feeling tired, but I can't go to bed until I hit my caloric goal. I debate whether I have the energy to cook a full meal or if I should just piece away at some milk and snacks for a bit. I choose the latter. I hit my goal for the day, but at what cost? I now have almost nothing left for the following day. If today was a struggle, tomorrow will only be harder. I look at my shirtless body in the mirror as I brush my teeth. I'm tired and bloated, but goddammit if I don't look bigger. 









 Pretty dark, but could be funny if done right. 














 Brothers and sisters in swole, like many of you, I didn't think it could happen to me. I read your stories of swolestation and felt the same rage you felt, but I thought I was safe. Surely those around me appreciate me for my personality, I believed. Yet, yesterday, at my own place of employment no less, I was used like some piece of farm equipment.

I'm relatively new to the Iron Path, but Brodin has been very good to me. I've noticed the stealthy glances of passersby as they 'mire my aesthetics, but I can take that because I also consider myself swole of spirit. But what happened yesterday was more than I can bare.

My work has conducted a food drive over the last two months to collect food for the less fortunate. I was extra motivated, as I saw this as an opportunity to give the aspiring followers of Brodin the fuel they need to make mad gains. Our store was very successful in our efforts and yesterday, we finally delivered the boxes of food to the food closet on the other side of town. There were dozens of boxes, many filled with canned goods. 

Without warning or asking me if I wanted to help, my boss informed me yesterday that she "needed my muscles" to help her deliver the food. I was dumbfounded. I've always tried to be the best employee I could be, but suddenly I found myself as nothing more than a tool to help move nonperishable food items. I have never felt so objectified. 

I sat in silence next to my boss on the car ride over as I tried my best to contain my tears. When we finally arrived, I did my best to deliver the boxes as quickly as possible so I could return to work and have a good think in the break room. As soon as the last box was set down, the food closet manager said perkily, "We sure are lucky to have you. Otherwise we would have been moving boxes all afternoon." Do you believe the nerve? She didn't even consider the possibility that the previous day was deadlift day and maybe lifting heavy boxes off the ground wasn't ideal for me. 

I'm at a loss, reddit. I thought my place of employment was my sanctuary. What should I do? 




 I'm not the most devout worshipper of Brodin, but I have paid my dues at the Iron Temple regularly this year, and have been blessed with righteous gains. I've been swolested on a couple of occasions, but I forgive those people, for they know not the error of their ways. The pain that their actions caused me was erased after an experience yesterday at work.


An unruly customer, neither swole of body or mind, threatened my boss after she banned him from the store. This was the third time she has had to ask him to leave and each time he has made a scene while exiting. Unfortunately, I was not present to witness the events as they happened that day, but they worried my boss. As the day went on and she resumed normal work activity, she needed to go to her car to get something. Although I was the youngest man working that day, it was me she asked to walk with her for protection. Brodin gave me this opportunity to use my gains for good. I escorted her to and from her car without incident. Although my presence was unnecessary, it felt good to be asked to provide protection. 





























 I just noticed that Waino is starting for the Cardinals today. That's HUGE!  




 Also meaning Volquez would pitch a potential 163rd game against St. Louis if it's needed.  




 I parlayed ATL with PIT. 




 I've been a fan of the sport for a while, but I never had a club team that I felt attached to, which kept me from really getting into it. Republic FC Is my team now. Looking forward to many more great seasons ahead (hopefully in MLS).  




 Sad news everyone. Someone broke into the LA Dodgers trophy case last night. The thieves were last seen fleeing the stadium carrying a blue carpet.  




 A Dodgers fan doesn't understand what "World Series" means. Sounds about right.  









 Can we get a gif of Amy G getting sprayed in the face? I, uh, need it...for stuff.  




 You mean you almost ji22ed.  




 **St. Louis Cardinals ML** vs Arizona Diamondbacks 


St. Louis is clinging to a one game lead in the division going into the final series of the season, so they still have a lot to play for. Arizona has all but given up. Michael Wacha is pitching for the Cardinals and I think he'll have a good game.  




 We're on fire right now. Yesterday's potd, Metallurg Magnitogorsk -1.5, hit, which makes three correct picks in a row. Let's keep it going! 




RULES 

 No picks that are favorite by more than -200 


 No parlay or teaser bets, single bets only, prop bets are fine 


 Please include what sport you are talking about in your pick 


 Pick with most points at the end of voting is our pick of the day  




 I've been a Giants fan for 15 years, but Derek Jeter has been a constant in baseball for as long as I can remember. This is kind of like saying goodbye to a part of my childhood.  




 Trying to stay optimistic here:


1. We're still in great position to win the wild card.


2. The goal of the game is to win the World Series, not the division. We're still up 2-0 on the Dodgers there.  




 Kershaw looks like Sunshine from Remember the Titans.  




 Andrew Susac is the go ahead run...the next time through the order.  




 His arm has been thrown out for 2 years.  




 The joke is on you. You can't clinch if the game never ends.  




 Bochy might as well ask if any Giants fans in the crowd can throw strikes.  




 I'm assuming if you have $749 to spend on Candlestick seats, you also have a man cave to put them.  




 I should win a Cy Young... 




 What is Uribe's walk up song? It's catchy. 




 I once bought a growler of IPA from Stone. The woman working there said I should drink it within 48 hours of opening it. I decided to drink all 74 ounces in one night. Big mistake.  




 You have to finish your 6 pack by tomorrow. You can't have a San Diego beer in the fridge during a Padres series.  




 This really has been a great season for the rivalry. There's a perfect combination of fear, respect and hatred for each team.  




 [How Arias feels in the dugout right now]( http://i.imgur.com/3leLBzY.gif) 




 Slightly above the mean^for ^^a ^^^white ^^^^guy 




 I'm guessing we want the lefty-righty matchup with Kershaw against Arias.  




 I'm betting on a lot of baseball games on Thursday, it's hard to pick just one potd. I'll go with the **Giants/Padres under 6.5**. The Giants have not been hitting the ball well lately and the Padres haven't hit the ball well all year. On top of that, Andrew Cashner is pitching for San Diego. He shut down SF last week. Yusmeiro Petit has been one of the most consistent pitchers for the Giants over the last month and a half. 


My other picks for the day are **DET ML**, **MIL ML**, **WAS ML** and, **TB/BOS over 8.5**. 




 We have a two day win streak going as yesterday's potd, the Angels ML, hit. Let's go for three!  




 It got scary in the late innings, but the Angels hang on. Good call on this one.  




 That's what happens when you meet girls at Wagner-fest.  




 If he goes 3, then Lincecum will come in, which probably means another run or two.  




 In the last week, the only two Giants hitters who have shown any consistency are Gregor Blanco and Joe Panik. Posey, Sandoval, Pence, Belt, Crawford and Perez look lost. 


Edit: I considered the over 6. Hudson's last start against LA he didn't retire a batter in the second inning. He looked bad against the Padres last time out too. The problem I have with the over 6 is that he's going to be on a short leash. He won't be in the game long enough to allow 6 runs. On top of that, Kershaw is pitching for LA.



Edit: Decided to parlay Dodgers ML and over 6.   




 I like the value of the **Chicago White Sox** ML. Chris Sale is pitching against Verlander. I think the Sox at +108 has good potential.  




 Hudson's been getting rocked for a month now. This is a safe bet, but my book has LA at -250 right now, so the pay out isn't enough for me, a Giants fan, to bet against my own team.  




 For the Giants, that's been the case for close to two weeks. Even when Bum hit his homerun, the dugout wasn't nearly as excited as they should have been.  




 This is a frustrating team to watch right now. There's no energy.  




 Yes, but we can't afford to have him hit like this while he figures it out. These games are too important.  




 Right now we have offensive black holes at 1st base and left field. We'll have to figure that out by next week.  




 0-2 count in a one run ballgame against your biggest rival? Time for the wave! 




 I've honestly seen nothing but respect for Vin in r/sfgiants.   




 I honestly believe that Curt Schilling only has a job with ESPN because they feel bad that he went broke and then got cancer.  




 [We know how good he is ;-)](http://mlb.mlb.com/images/10252010/15826076/250x350_Uribe.jpg) 




 Maybe the most satisfying home run of the year.  




 Little do you know, there are world series trophies in that garbage can.  




 I thought I saw him pull up limp as he hit first too.  




 Puig got hit in the first. Words were exchanged, benches were warned.  




 Hopping on the bandwagon to lose in the first round once every 3 years?  




 Does anyone know for sure if the benches were warned after that HBP?  




 Puig knows he couldn't take Bum. It would be like a kid getting beat up by his dad.  




 Am I crazy or does Carl Crawford get an usual number of rest days? Is there a reason for that? He's on fire this month, but it seems like he's out of the lineup for half of the Dodgers game I've watched recently.  




 The reason I keep coming to this subreddit is because there's always a pick of the day that is two teams I've never heard of, in a sport I don't watch, in a league I've never heard of. I love putting a bet on Japanese level II women's soccer and waking up to some money. Warms my heart.  




 We got back on track on Tuesday with the Kansas City Royals ML. They won 7-1 Let's extend the streak to two.  




 My 5 team parlay was in tact going into the CAR/PIT game last Sunday. I thought the Panthers were a sure thing, but they totally blew it for me.  




 I'm on board with this as well. Good pick.  




 Me too. And that thought made me sick. I think what's so great about the rivalry right now is that there's a mutual fear of each other's team.  




 Off the top of my head, I can't remember a more exciting game. LA has so many guys with power, I was certain one of them would hit a walk off homer. That was pure torture for 4+ hours, but I loved every second of it.  




 He couldn't have picked the ball up and placed it in Butera's glove any better. Incredible!  




 It's a good thing they won, because I don't think I could have handled a loss. See you all tomorrow night, boys and girls.  




 Auburn checking in. He went to Jesuit.  




 Susac was held at third, but Blanco didn't notice and went for the triple. When he finally saw that third wasn't open he was in a pickle. When the Dodgers tried to get him, Susac ran home.  




 Crawford channeling his inner Chris Dominguez with that throw.  




 Puig could not have walked the ball to home plate and placed it in Butera's glove in a better position than that throw. Amazing.  




 Is there any doubt that this is the best rivalry in baseball right now? Yankees/Red Sox hasn't been exciting for a few years.  




 This is the rivalry at its best. I love it, ^but ^^I ^^^also ^^^^hate ^^^^^it 




 The Giants have 9 hits and the Dodgers have 3 errors. This game is being handed to us. We just need to take it.  




 You didn't think anyone would know who the greatest of all time is?  




 #RedMamba  




 This is the Giants/Dodgers rivalry at its best. I love it^but ^^I ^^^also ^^^^hate ^^^^^it 




 If he had held Belt there, we would have been freaking out on him too. Literally the only way Belt is out at home is if Puig's throw is perfect, and it was.  




 I don't see a better option at 3rd unfortunately.  




 Too much butter, not enough finger.  




 I like the hustle. 




 Look at those empty seats behind home plate. Disgraceful!  




 Free baseball!!! 




 Instructions for Dodgers fans.  




 Good morning ^good ^afternoon ^^good ^^night 




 We liked him when his schtick was new and exciting, but I think most of us were tired of defending him by the time he left.  




 The only thing bigger than Brian Wilson's ego is his era.  




 This pitcher looks like he's about to join ISIS. 




 Last week of the season, Bottom 7, one on against your most hated rival. Better do the wave!  




 There's a free version, but you only get a limited number of skips per hour and you can't select which song you listen to, only the artist/album.


I pay $10/month to be able to listen any song at any time. You can get a free trial to see if it's worth it. I even got a 3 month's for the price of one deal when I signed up.  




 Good morning^goodafternoon^^good night


Edit: Fuck it! I don't know how to format.  




 Your mom took her shirt off?!! 




 Your rock hard Peavy is giving me a Peavy.  




 What should we do? Cry about it?  




 That's frustrating as fuck when that happens in Road to the Show. It's got to be even worse in real life.  




 I think any intentional HBPs are dumb. It's hard to say definitively that that was intentional though.  




 Matt Kemp was distracted wondering how Rihanna dumped him for Chris Brown.  




 Kemp called it. That one's on Puig.  




 I'm assuming there's bad traffic getting to the game.  




 Jake Peavy looks like he could have been an Irish bare knuckle boxer a hundred years ago.  




 I like the value of the **KC Royals** ML. They're the underdog and they're playing a team with a nearly identical record, but they have a better pitcher pitching. I think they're worth a bet. 



I also like the **under 6** on the **Dodgers/Giants** game. Bumgarner has absolute ownage against the Dodgers in his career. Greinke is pitching for LA and the Giants haven't been hitting lately. It might also be worth putting a unit on the Giants ML. They're underdogs, but I think there's good value there.  




 What happened to the user who usually posts the potd thread?  




 I think this is the safest MLB bet of the day. St. Louis is a better team and they have their best pitcher pitching. 




 I got tired of my usual workout music. I had always been a fan of certain songs on The Dark Knight Rises score because they made made feel like Batman training in a prison cell, so I set out to find equally motivating music. I took mainly from the work of Hans Zimmer (TDKR, TDK, Pirates of the Caribbean, Gladiator, Man of Steel, Inception, The Lone Ranger), but there are a few other artists in the playlist. It's mostly upbeat, but has the occasional slower pace, which makes the eventual build up even more epic and motivational. 



Give it a listen and let me know what you think. Tell me if there's a song I should add to or remove from the list. I'm by no means knowledgeable about this kind of music, so I'm sure there are plenty of awesome songs that I don't know about. 



[Here is the finished product]( http://open.spotify.com/user/swolebuddha/playlist/1gQZicqZROQnFYsbQO0Zp7). I hope it serves you well. 




 It's kind of late and no one has posted a potd thread yet, so I'll do it.  




 As you can see, my picks thus far are 12-1-1 against the spread


Wow, this guy *is* pretty good.



 That puts me at a total of 17-12-1 so far this year




Oh... 




 Is this the only nationally televised morning game? Usually Fox will have one, but they don't.  




 I made a parlay bet that the Angels would win and more than 7 1/2 runs would be scored. Help a Giants fan out, will you halos? 


Edit: Atta team.  




 I broke my own rule of not betting on games I'm emotionally invested in. I took the under 6 on this game. I have that much faith in Petit. ^And ^that ^little ^faith ^in ^our ^offense 




 I can't find an email about it and I can't redeem it on the app. Has anyone besides OP been successful? Maybe it has to be done on a pc. 


Edit: Can't find it on my computer either. Maybe it expired?  




 I'm down to go out in Roseville most nights. We should meet up.  




 Posey has 15 RBIs in his last 15 games. That's second best in the league for the month of September.  




 If Timmy pitches well tonight, I say we start him for Hudson next week in LA.  




 His smile is so smug. You can tell he's proud of his idea.

 Pretty smokey in the mornings in Auburn too.  
























 Because there is no force. If the bases were loaded, touching the plate would be enough. 




 Pablo rakes right handed pitching too. 




 35 




 Just bought Moneyball (book) today. Stoked to start it after the game tonight.  




 Pete Rose looks like a Cabbage Patch Doll. 




 Pablo Sandoval, you're the next contestant on "Who wants to win a $90 million contract." 




 My baseball pet peeve is when crowds boo timeouts, pick off attempts and mound visits.  




 Nothing but love for Nate. Good Giant.  




 And they say baseball is a sport for nerds... 




 Dude, that's exactly it. It's the chin and slicked back hair. 




 Welcome to AT T. Where homeruns go to die. 




 I don't care what anyone thinks, I fucking love that Jeter commercial. 




 Good, good, let the hate flow through you. 




 That's the greatest compliment you can give a baseball team.

 The $200 million contract probably makes it pretty easy. 




 It was a no win situation for Mattingly. Pulling the best pitcher alive for one of the worst bullpens in the league would have been criticized too.  




 You should come to the good side. You get one every 2 years. 




 How the hell, in a NLDS game, do they not have a camera angle from behind the base?  




 This was a must win game for the Cardinals with Kershaw and Greinke pitching games 4 and 5. Should be an exciting end to the series. 




 #I'm up all night to get Lackey!  




 AJ Ellis stole Puig's hitting ability Space Jam style.  




 I hate it when people compare Matt Carpenter to Jesus. I mean, he's cool and all, but he's no Matt Carpenter.  




 Puig is historically bad right now...I love it. 




 Someone has this exact same comment in the earlier game day thread, Even down to the same misspelling of Nielsen.  




 That's the conclusion the author of the article came to.  









 Hunter Pence hates off days so much he had the team take a dive today so the series could continue.  




 From the looks of it, they're still in their seats.  




 In the playoffs, Bumgarner turns into Kershaw and Kershaw turns into Edwin Jackson.  




 We're used to stretches of no offense. 




 Like Sherman could even be in the same conversation as Griffey Jr.  




 Ishikawa is a completely different player now than he was with us in 2010. He used to be an automatic out that played outstanding defense at first. Now he always gives a professional at bat.  




 Pablo wants that $90mil.  




 Bum took a ball off the shin? That poor baseball! 




 It's gotta be his defense. 




 What exactly does this mean for the franchise? Why should I be excited?  




 If only I could maintain an erection! 




 TBS just plays the same five commercials on repeat. 




 As opposed to Detroit, where no one has a job.  




 I loved going to trivia night at Rosie O'Grady's when I lived in San Diego.  




 I'm curious, are any non-Angels fans rooting for the Angels in this series? It seems like the Royals are everyone's sweetheart right now.  




 At this point, the only thing Josh Hamilton can hit is a crack pipe.  




 Game going 19 innings confirmed.  




 Same here. I don't have anything against the A's themselves. Their fans on the other hand... 




 If half of the salty Tiger fans in this thread had bought tickets, they probably could have come close to selling out CoMerica today. 




 Red Sox/Yankees is definitely over hyped, but when they're both competitive it's a great rivalry. It was the best in baseball in the mid 2000s and will be again someday. It's felt forced the last few years though.  




 The AL West is odd because there are no great rivalries.  A's/Angels was pretty good this year though. It probably won't last though. 




 Vertical line 




 The last resort of a fan who has given up hope. 




 I agree about the A's/Giants. Most Giants fans generally root for the A's to succeed. It seems like Oakland fans are the only ones who consider this a rivalry.  




 Remains silent 




 Is this game seriously not a sellout? That's shameful!  




 Torii has a son named Money Hunter? Dear God... 




 KC was wild for the WC game and Pittsburg was wild until Crawford hit the grand slam. Every other crowd has been a let down. Looking forward to the Royals game tonight.  




 Nah, gotta rep your city.  




 It's easy to say Zimmerman was pulled to early now that we have the benefit of hindsight, but he had just walked the potential tying run to bring Posey to the plate. It would have been Posey's fourth AB against him and he had had a few good at bats already, including a rocket to third base last time. 




 This game is going 19 innings.  




 We got dominated for 8.2 innings, but still stole this one. Feelsgoodman.jpeg  




 Whooo? 




 Hudson pitched 7.1 innings of one run ball and he's not even the best pitcher for the Giants tonight. 




 *"John, this game is not over yet."* 




 I'm telling my my grandchildren about the first 9 innings right now. 




 I don't think there's a single person outside of the LA area that doesn't have the Royals as their #2 team right now.  




 Did I glance? Please. I'm still erect from that!  




 I've never seen as much salt from a subreddit as I see in /r/angelsbaseball right now.  




 Hala wala!  




 Which scrub did the Dodgers start tonight and when do they pitch their ace?  




 That kid behind home plate will swing at anything. Madbum needs to start with the chin music and work his way across the plate. 




 Really Kruk? It wouldn't surprise you if the best hitter in the NL got a hit?  




 Somewhere in the middle of game six in the 2002 WS, I commented about how sad the fans looked. That game and series turned around right there. I'm not doing that again. 




 Madison "Dad dick" Bumgarner  




 Seriously, who has sex without being wasted?  




 Who the hell cares what Curt Schilling thinks?  




 This silence is deafening.  




 [Aye! Que lindo!]( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BjRPvHECYAAZcQ5.jpg) 




 Very good. 




 Hunter Pence prefers Hunts ketchup. 




 Likewise, Piratesbros.  




 He's been a solid bench player for us. Always has a professional at bat, has power and plays great defense ^at ^^first ^^base 




 [Let's do this!]( http://imgur.com/ZJGHNh3) 




 I'd love to face Kershaw twice in 7 games^no ^^I ^^^wouldn't 




 I've always been a fan of logos that include the letters of the team's city. It seems like the NL has more of that. 




 Can we have a moment of appreciation for MLB Network? After being raised on ESPN, it's such a refreshing change. 




 If it should come to it, rather than extra innings, the game should be decided by a competition between left fielders. Whoever is better at shagging grounders at 1st wins. 




 Best of luck, Piratesbros! I've never been a believer in having number 2 teams, but if I had to pick one, it would be you.  




 Let's just end the season after this game. No one can top this. 




 Time to send back the "Always October" sweatshirts.  




 Alright, I think we've all established that we don't like the announcers. We can talk about something else.  




 Ernie seemed so bored during that home run call I assumed it was a lazy fly ball to center. That made it all the more shocking.  




 #BOOM. YOASTED.  




 Best bullpen in the league.  




 Son, there are some things you should know about Missouri... 




 Something tells me we're not watching the future WS champions tonight.  




 It's fitting that a Marlins fan is confused by an excited crowd.  




 You jelly, bro? 




 Not until the bottom of the ninth in game 7 of the WS.  




 Unless there's two of them, Bridges is right by SDSU. They are offering $3 beers for anyone in Giants gear.  




 I feel like I should be excited, but I don't know what this means. Can anyone enlighten me?  




 2006 @ Miami 21-0 




 It's like watching the end of an era.

 A's fans are like that younger sibling who is living a very successful life, but obsesses over their more successful older sibling.  




 That's a routine 9-4-2-3.  




 It's in the box score as a double, because he was thrown out going back to second. I just don't know how to show that he was retired.  




 How do I score that Belt double at home?  




 Says a lot about Jeter that he can get a standing ovation from the fans he absolutely tormented for 20 years. Baseball won't be the same without him.
