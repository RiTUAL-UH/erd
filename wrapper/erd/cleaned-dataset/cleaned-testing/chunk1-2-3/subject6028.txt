 Just a joke, back in some of the early YogPods Simon would use the same voice, the "pubby" voice, and people would complain that it was racist or some shit 




 First few minutes of this video... so fucking racist :P 




 I beat the Asylum demon without dying and thought I was a God... but now I'm being decimated by poison in fucking Blighttown.

 Jack is really entertaining in this episode

Alternative rock, but wikipedia says punk so fine I concede

 You do know that songs like Savior does not represent band's discography, right?

 Did you not even listen to the link I posted?

skimmed it 




 generally what a sentence consists of, yes... 




 sure you can, but partying is detrimental and your intelligence will taper off at a point 




 whatever, you have misunderstood 




 they just fall into that category dude, dont expand your mind or anything, you aint learning if you're coked up listening to some dubstep malarkey 




 not for everyone else just trying to enjoy the music

also, rise against isn't punk 




 i dont think what redthatalready meant was in sexism but in opposition to the prevalent anti intellectualism (drugs electronic music parties extrovision) that is on the rise in the western world 




 Wish not death on your satan, but enlightenment to deliver them from ignorance. 




 Ah yes, the Top Gear lads, partying it up in their free time, destroying the environment in their working hours. 




 Work at Target for six years 




 Why? 




   I don't consider you human.

 OI don't fucking downvote mattie1 and jackfrost in their own fucking conversation have some RESPECT!

oh and don't downvote me either ever again 




 they won't but don't tell people what to do or they'll do the opposite 




 hey thanks for completely missing the point and winning karma by chastising me

i thought you guys liked satire? 




 well yeah because my satire deters them 




 'cause when this post gets more attention there will be an influx of people crying about sponsor only content, might as well fire off a preemptive ridicule in their general direction

 I cut off all contact with her, her family and our mutual friends. I did the best I could to remove my internet presence and pretty much became dead to that friend circle.

My breakup wasn't too bad, just generic compatibility issues. No hard feelings. 




 no it's funny cause he's stuck in the Ecuador embassy in London, so, like, who else is he going to have a press conference with? Drederick Tatum?  




 No Gavin?! ARGHHHHHH ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Edit: 

satire
sat/
noun
the use of humour, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. 




 Dead Workers Party? Don't you mean The Shaft? 




 Strippin is a damn traitor. Ditching his friends and moving to the US. Can't we just ignore this guy? 
























 what is DRM 




 That's not a bad thing! 




 Pretty sure I'm shadowbanned from /r/gaming, which is weird because I've never posted there prior to my ban. 




 Oh, sorry, I forgot that oh-so important politically correct term "in my opinion", oopsies.  




 How am I?  




 hey by posting that comment /u/Fiji_Artesian is just pointing out his favourite bit :) 




 He's not a teenager anymore, so he's FAIR GAME 




 in football a referee doesn't need to give a reason why he gives out a yellow card 




 hey think you lads need a third party referee so here I am

/u/bbruinenberg you are WRONG
/u/sjrogue you are in the RIGHT 




 Ray is so good at video games 




 Infuriating  




 Has having the name Brad ever been a hurdle in your life? 




 Michael to Michael: he is an infallible God.

Michael to everyone else: he is a fucking arrogant, lying, piece of shit. "oo I never said Jaws once", stfu, LOSER!

Michael is a psychopath, to think he's married. What a joke. Least he provides more entertainment than SOME members, though (eyes looking at you Narvarez Jr).

Insult to injury, Michael: "Gavin said Jars." REALLY?! 




 Missed the reference, eh? 




 A fedora would suit you. 




 Gavin: Remember his fleshlight?

Love how nobody responded to that out of fear of the backlash. 




  Esbrainrot, my brain rot, one-sixty, swiftly

Edit: forgot the fanbase is a bit to young to get that reference  




 yeah um I never want to see miles again 




 Hahaha, yeah bro, man, dude /s 




 Ah, alright. Thanks. 




 Black Widow is a cool character, really, I mean, she's attractive sure... but she's not just eye candies 

Edit: Unshadow ban me btw 




 Huh, why? Who is Matt? 




 That Gilby guy is a ruffian, he's really going to hurt someone one day 




 Strippin the traitor 




 I don't care if this is fake, it's fucking funny. 




 And the tumblr user is ripping off Nintendo.  




 This is offensive. 




 nty 




 ? 




 why shadow ban me 




 Did ya ever think it'd be so easy? 




 Hey, why shadowban me?  




 Hi, why am I shadowbanned?

Edit: kk looks like I AINT, ty 




 Do you feel blame? **Are you mad?** Uh, do you feel like wolf kabob Roth vantage? Gefrannis booj pooch boo jujube; bear-ramage. Jigiji geeji geeja geeble Google. Begep flagaggle vaggle veditch-waggle bagga? 




 Oh, shut the fuck up. 




 Hopefully you'll be judged by your merits and not your appearance
 




 Not sure if you're joking but you could just wear gloves to your job interviews and nobody will know 




 liar, it's summer. 




 like what
 




 Leave out the bit about not reading the book, it undermines your entire opinion hehe 




 ... what the fuck? 




 whatever dude, I don't pander to the masses and censor myself 




 Nope! 




 That haircut is rad, what are you talking about? 




 Haha, wow. What an aggressive reply[!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A) 




  Be respectful of each other. This is not a place for hate. 




 careful mentioning other let's players in this sub

Edit: not that I have a problem with it personally, but I've seen people saying they enjoy the yogscast or whatever, and BAM, downvotes and rage

Edit 2: And my experimental first edit has proven this, mentioning the yogscast has tripled my downvotes. Nice! 




 no gavin? 




  Just because he doesn't make the same joke 815 times doesn't mean he's half assing.

lol 




 some sort of fetish of yours?

;'( ;'( ;'( ;'( ;'( ;'(

hope this helps 




 ;'(
 




 oops, I meant JJ, my bad 




 so many enraging things in this video.

Chris, that Jerry hick, an advert, Blaine, Gilby, a game of thrones spoiler, ~~Brandon~~ JJ, shameless shirt plugging, and a cliffhanger 




 man, he sounds so hurt at the end 




 hey dudeman it stands for Drunk Gamers - the website they had before doing RvB 




 oh man far out 




 Podcast crew... but um...? I don't... haha...



NO GAVIN?!? 




 tits are tits 




 Doesn't 




 Watch the video... proof is right there 




 Hopefully not, drunk people are annoying. Remember when Gavin was drunk in that Goat Simulator video? Got annoying fast, imo 




 No, you were pretty spot on 




 Haha, this is so sly. "Oh, look, Geoff is in this, wahoo." Then BAM! Lindsay.

I can smell the rage. 




  people here downvote for the dumbest shit 




 as long as one person finds it funny (me), then it's still subjectively funny 




 Ummm, subjectivity, bitch, look it up 




 Oh btw, Gavin bought a house

Edit: Obligatory woooooooooosh! The joke is that Gavin buying a house has been mentioned in like 20 things now 




 So glad that didn't end with the Loch Ness monster. Thanks for the reply! I always forget that for Americans to travel to Europe etc they're looking at an 8 hour flight. 




 Ehhh, not really, imgur links are more convenient and not many people will click a random tumblr link 




 Which country did he go to? 




 Gilby, I think 




 oh, a lot of us are boycotting russia for obvious reasons 




 Shame this game is set in Russia 




 Gavin is so tryhardy when it comes to alcohol 




 Yogventures, a game that was in development, was cancelled because it was pretty unrealistic or something, so now people who paid for it on kickstarter are angry.

Then there's some other thing called YogDiscovery which I've only found out about, apparently yogscast want indie devs to come to them, they'll make videos of the game and depending on how many views the video gets, and how many sales the game gets, yogscast will take a percentage of the profits from the devs.  




 that's a literary technique though 





























 Maybe if those jackasses would stop shooting his tires out... 




 he did 




 Do you like Huey Lewis and The News? 




 no gavin 




 Wonder what that acronym means?

 I mean he looks more likeable TO ME. Like MY high school fat best friend, early Jonah Hill style. Now he's more of a Seth Rogen and that is lame, IN MY OPINION.

Subjectivity, how does it work? 




 I mean he looks more LIKEABLE. Like your high school fat best friend, early Jonah Hill style. Now he's more of a Seth Rogen and that is LAME
