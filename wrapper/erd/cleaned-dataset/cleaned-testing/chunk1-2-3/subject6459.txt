 Journalists won't take pictures because they know they will be retaliated against if they do; in this report he said they might delay airing the report for their safety. I would be surprised if he's ever let in Gaza again. 




 So HOW should they do it instead? 




 Wary. They'll turn back to anti-semitism as soon as their preachers have a change of heart. 




 If true, this would give an almost 1:1 militant to civilian ratio, which is in line with previous conflicts in the Gaza strip. The Gaza Health ministry run by Hamas say that there has been 1,900 dead, of which 80% or so are civilians. 









 He meant 96% of West Bank civilians, under areas A and B. 




 Because, legally, as soon as the charge is brought Israel can counter charge the PA with much worse. 




 To add a bit too this, the "character" of God in both Islam and Judaism are almost the same, so much so that it is universally agreed within Judaism that Muslims worship the same God. It's a debate whether Christians are polytheistic or not. 




 It's a midrash that Muhammed took and incorporated into the Qur'an. 




 To add to Lazer_Taxon, the evangelicals in America are the greatest "bloc" support of Israel -- but only because they believe it will hasten the second coming. As soon as their preachers switch back to anti-Semitism, 15% of America will go back to hating Jews again. 




 A quote without a source! Might it be pulled out of your ass? 




 It is no no longer a war crime if it is used as a military site, which is what Hamas is doing to this hospital. So Israel is going to bomb one building, not the whole thing, once all the civilians leave. 




 maddoweis.net

Nice joke, hilarious! 




 Older people saw the international Palestinian terrorism during the cold war, and educatikn teaches you is not as simple as casualty numbers. 




 To get a different perspective about the letter, read this:

I'm going to try to re-translate the letter myself and see if it comes out differently.

 Kidnap. If they're not allowing Red Cross visits or abiding by the Geneva Conventions, it's kidnapping. 




 The attack came less than 2 hours into the "ceasefire." 




 Please change "they" to "Hamas", you don't know how stupid some people are.

Edit: People upvoted my comment, I guess that works just as well. 




 Soldiers are captured if they are allowed visits by the Red Cross and the captors follow the other Geneva Conventions related to POW's. Hamas doesn't, so the soldier is kidnapped.  




 THe army went in the day that Hamas militants first attacked from one of these tunnels. Unless you think Israel controls Hamas... 




 The tunnels going into Israel cannot be used to transfer goods, they are only to attack Israel. 




 http://this-is-not-jewish.tumblr.com/post/34344324495/how-to-criticize-israel-without-being-anti-semitic 




 There are actually a lot of reports that ground troops are really frustrated that, though they are finding lots of tunnels and booby-trapped houses, they can't get the people shooting at them. 




 Wow, great rebuttal. I'm impressed. 




 Not quite yet. It will if Israel decides to go further. 




 For the 10th time, [Haaretz live blog at 7:45pm.](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.607945) I couldn't submit it because as a live blog it was already submitted. 




 Correct me if I'm wrong

You are wrong. All of the tunnels that Israel is destroying now are ones leading into Israel to conduct terrorist attacks. The IDF only put boots on the ground in Gaza after the attack from one such tunnel. 




 ...what? Because this is true. 




 Um, no?

This is the "Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War."

This specific section is "Wounded and sick IV. Discontinuance of protection of **hospitals**" [emphasis added]

If you want to prove your point, find a general article, or at least one that doesn't mention that it's specifically for hospitals

  




  Yet they didnt do it last time they had chance, nor ever before.

When was this time? They've only attacked sporadically from tunnels after it was clear that the IDF is going to destroy them so Hamas won't be able to use them in the future. 

The tunnels were stupidly not taken as a big danger by the government until now. If one attack happened from a tunnel and casualties resulted, Israel would immediately invade Gaza and destroy them. They could only be used once/in one military operation.

They dont need 10 people kidnapped, they can get the equal attention by a single guy or a couple.

No, they need as much people killed and kidnapped as possible, for popularity, money, and exchanges.
 




 Unfortunately, there will be no journalists in the area because it's an active military zone and ground fighting. No confirmation from other completely unbiased sources will have to wait. 




 If Israel is destroying everyone and everything, they're doing a horrible job at it. I'm sure that given 3000 bombs the US could level Gaza within a few hours. 




 And everything else is just a claim by Hamas. Do you actually expect journalists to report every detail about military operations from an active military zone? 




 http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter4_rule14 




 So if I shoot at you many times but either miss or hit your bulletproof vest, you'll just sit there and take it? 




 Good, now you're reading! Not quite enough though. This is only regarding hospitals, **not UN shelters.** Find another article to support your claim. In addition, the only time Israel has deliberately bombed hospitals is with imminent military activity or large stores of weapons and warnings. 




 Purpose? To massacre and kidnap Israeli civilians. This achieves many of their goals at once. 




 No, the censor doesn't provide false info. Does the IDF itself? Very possibly, many militaries do. 




 It was formed specifically for Palestinians because of the creation of tons of Palestinian refugees when the ~~general assembly granted Israel the land~~ war broke out between Israel and the surrounding Arab countries, including Palestinians. There would have been no refugee problem without the war.

And really, the ones in the West Bank and Gaza (especially the latter) should not be called refugees. 

1. No other population has refugee status transferred to children.

2. Those under the control of the PA and hamas are free to move around in their territory, they don't have to stay in refugee camps. But it presents a better image to the world and continues their claim, so they stay. 




 Haaretz specifically mentions it, and I've linked to it a bunch of times here. 




 No, initially it was reporting (and still is) 70-80% civilian casualties,  "among them" women and children. Easy to be misled though, with how it's reported. Currently, [by the washington post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/world/gaza-counter/), about 1/10 are women and 1/5 are children under 18. Women make up 50% of the populace, while children make up around 50-60%

Your source is the top end, the UN is reporting 3:1 or 4:1, and the IDF is saying between 1:1 and 2:1. But for now, these high numbers will be used to bash Israel as much as possible while the reports in 3 months will be brushed under the rug. 




 I'm saying that there is one refugee organization for the Palestinians and one for everyone else. It's not racist, but it is a double standard. 




 Eh, state actors are still expected to minimize casualties if possible. 




 The journalists know the full news, even if they can't publish it. Again, they wouldn't publish something false deliberately. 




 85% is a 1:5.5 ratio, and I'm sure it will go down right after the fighting is over and Hamas announces their martyrs. It doesn't change the fact that lots of civilians are suffering though. 




 Oh, Israel has done a lot wrong. There just happens to be (or was) an Israeli peace movement, but not a Palestinian one. It sucks. 




 "Terrorism" or not, they are still a military target. And rockets are purposefully attacking civilians with the purpose of committing genocide, even if they suck at it. 




 Because logistically, it's impossible to bring stuff in and out more than once without Israel noticing. 




 Reading comprehension alert:

the presence of small arms and ammunition taken from such combatants and not yet handed to the proper service, shall not be considered to be acts harmful to the enemy.

these are neither "small arms and ammunition" nor have they been "taken from combatants."  




 Saving your comment! 




 The first rockets and war with Gaza (2006) was before the blockade took effect. Lifting it now would only cause a free flow of weapons into the strip. 




 They are currently hiding in the network of tunnels built instead of  hospitals and bomb shelters. So brave. 




 He has reported for The Jerusalem Report, the Forward, the Wall Street Journal and WRNI among others

Nice selection bias. Most Israelis serve in the IDF that doesn't mean anything.

 




 Great response :P 




 Ok, provide proof if you think otherwise. 




 So what should Israel do instead? 




 What do you mean, stupid? During a lull in the fighting when Israel is not  expecting it, possibly during a holiday, they break out of 8-10 tunnels near towns. Then they murder and kidnap as many people as possible before escaping. 




 If there is military activity in the area, it becomes a legitimate military target even if it is a declared safe zone. It then comes down to the amount of civilian casualties vs. military benefit like any other target. Doesn't make it a war crime to do so unless the civilian casualties are extremely excessive. 




 The first two were written before the full news came out, as did Haaretz. Haaretz then published an update after the full information was cleared for publishing. 




 Again, this is less than a mile from the boarder with Gaza and is constantly monitored. The only reason that they weren't discovered until now is because they are closed at the top until the militants attack. Why wouldn't they just use the Egypt ones they have? Why use thousands of tons of concrete for these and not the ones into Egypt? 




 The 8:1 ratio. 




 That's because it's an organization with helps refugees -- but only Palestinian ones. 




 Haaretz has it too, is that any better for you? It is still coming from the IDF in the end.

I think Israel has made numerous mistakes for this assault, and I'm still waiting for an explanation of the bombing/shelling of the market and school today. That doesn't mean that Israel is committing genocide or deliberately killing civilians. 




 Just think about the logistics of transferring goods into Israel, to the border which Israel is constantly watching, and then bringing those goods into the tunnels and out the other side. You really think this was ever done? 




 How many months did it take to build this tunnel while it was being used? You think the UN employees didn't know about it? 




 Cite the 8:1 source, which means only 1 out of every 9 people killed is civilian. The most I've seen (out of the Hamas run health agency!) is 4:1, and sometime 3:1. They've claimed similar numbers before, but when the dust has settled down it usually comes to around a 1:1 ratio, and I am expecting the same to happen this time. 




 I would love to be paid for this! I would be making so much money right now. :P 




 [It also has lots of credible journalists.  
](http://www.timesofisrael.com/about/)
 




 where, link? You're claiming two things in this thread and citing no proof. 




 Do you have a link to the last? Hebrew is fine. 




 Not yet. I bet Hamas' plan was to attack from all of them at once, but they didn't get the opportunity before the fighting started. 




 Read Haaretz every day and then say that no one ever criticizes the IDF. 




 The tunnels into Egypt are for smuggling, but it's not like Hamas can transfer goods into tunnels in Israeli territory. Why do you think they're building tunnels into Israel, [most of them near civilian towns](http://i0.wp.com/www.jewishpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IDF-map-of-TerrorTunnels.jpg?fit=485%2C485)? 




 No Israeli newspaper will deliberately print false information. [The US had a censorship office during WWII as well.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Censorship) 




 Haaretz current live blog at 7:45 

http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.607945 




 Well, the post is gone now and it wouldn't allow me to comment *shrug*

Unfortunately, no international news source is publishing info like this as fast or as thoroughly as Israeli news sources are. It would be nice if CNN or other international publications produced the detailed reporting that ToI and haaretz is doing, but they don't have the audience for it.

The IDF might be wrong, but there is no source for this outside the IDF anyway, and any news organization would have to source them. That doesn't answer why you think ToI is run by the IDF. 




 Because the UN workers live in a culture where they are under threat by Hamas and it's much easier to look the other way than than speak out, especially when you came to help Palestinians anyway and your boss is doing the same. 




 This Israeli censor doesn't provide false information, only prohibits some news to be released for a time. 




 Because you can call a building empty, but if Israel tries to bomb it as a legitimate military target than civilians in the two other buildings can be hurt/killed. 




 And what about haaretz?

http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.607945 at 7:45 




 Building underground is easier than building above ground, really? I guess we're just really inefficient then, and we should all live in hobbit holes!

Plus, there is still quite a lot of empty land is gaza to build on, just look at google maps. 




 It comes from an IDF general stating what 800,000 tons of concrete could build; that is just math. Why do you think that ToI is any more "run by high ranking IDF members" than any other Israeli news site.

Edit: ~~Since you deleted your comment downthread~~ since your comment was deleted...

OP here, not a shill. I am Israeli, and started posting when I began to be disturbed by all the shit that gets posted here. I'm actually a leftist and would gladly vote for Meretz if I trusted Palestinian people/leadership, but like 95%+ of Israeli Jews I support this operation. I will need to look at what is said about the shelling of the school and market today, as well as some other things that happened;  like the "IDF bombing" of the school a few days ago which turned out to be an Islamic Jihad misfired rocket. I can't say anything about that now though, or I would contribute to the "Israel is a genocidal baby murderer" meme here. People can't seem to understand that it is neither in Israel's strategic interest, not do they want to, kill civilians. 
























 I hears reports of at least 13 Hamas members captured or surrendering. Is this possibly one of the goals of the ground invasion, maybe for intelligence purposes, or just a fluke? I don't remember any reports of captures members in 2006 or 2008. 







































 I've been fasting since early this morning; no food and no water. Since starvation mode is activated when you eat too little, I'm wondering exactly when it starts? I would really like some free energy right now. Anyone have tips to make it begin? I'm starting to feel weak...

Edit: oy, Poe's law. In case people didn't get it, this is satire. I am really fasting though. Thankfully it ends soon after sundown. 




 A UN agency recently announced that around 75% the Palestinian casualties in Gaza. Is this correct, or is it just the UN again? If it is true, why is it higher than the 1:1 ratio in the previous two Gaza operations? 









 Jesus very obviously did not fulfill the important messianic prophecies which people associate with the Messianic age. [\(A small list.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/wiki/jesus) The usual counterargument is that Jesus will return and and fulfill all of them in the second coming. But if I don't believe in Jesus in the first place, why should I assume this? The Messiah will be the person who brings in the Messianic age -- if he dies before doing so, then he cannot be the Messiah ([see Bak Kokhva an example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt)).

So can you prove from the Tanach (Old Testament) that the Messiah will either die before fulfilling the prophecies or come back to Earth after dying? I reject the validity of the New Testament, so unless you want to try to prove that first, it won't be very productive to argue from there.

 




 I know this thread has probably been posted many times in the past, but I have two specific questions I don't have answers to.

1. Why do Muslims think that the text of the Tanach (the Torah, Prophets, and Writings) was corrupted? I know that there is a su'rah (is that the right term?) claiming such, it would be nice if someone could quote it. But I would also like to know how parts are determined to be corrupted and how it happened. Is it just assumed to be the stuff that contradicts the Qu'ran? [I had a small discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/29de5y/islamic_view_on_jews/cik3of9) with /u/possiblea2m about it, but he couldn't follow up on the final answer he gave me, so I clarification on that would be nice as well.

2. Do all Muslims believe that the current Jews are not related to B'nai Yisrael? I was told a such by /u/Redhawk1000 [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/29de5y/islamic_view_on_jews/cijzcnq), but he didn't finish answering my questions. If yes, why? When did the split/loss occur? If no, why is are the quotes wrong? (I have very limited background in Arabic, so please provide translation if you can. Interlinear/transliteration is even better.)

Oh and one minor question I recently thought of. Do the Qu'ran record any prophets in the line of Ishmael (edit: besides Muhammed)? I haven't seen any referenced, but that doesn't mean there aren't.

Thanks in advance for answering! Feel free to ask me any questions about Judaism as well. 

   /May you find peace. 




 My computer is a Dell Inspiron 1440, running windows 7. My computer was slowing down after longer periods of use (over an hour), especially while playing games. I asked here on the live chat what I could do to improve performance and was given various good suggestions. Now, I consider myself somewhat knowledgeable about software if not hardware (I know, I know, I lot of people say this, but I have a little experience programming), so my computer was already clean of malware and I had been disabling unneeded programs running in the background. After trying some of the minor suggestions, I decided to clean the fan when I downloaded Coretemp and realized my computer could run up to 190 degrees F even when only using internet and video chat when in a 70 degree room. After seeing this, I decided to clean the out the fan and make sure nothing was wrong with parts of the computer.

I watched a video on how to disassemble the parts, and it was a great learning experience! Unfortunately, in order to access the fan, I had to take out the motherboard as well instead of just the keyboard and outer case. The fan was indeed dusty, though not quite as bad as other pictures I looked at online. I cleaned the fan using a small vacuum and cloth, cleaned the motherboard of dust with compressed air, and wiped down the non-electrical parts of the computer. I made sure I was very careful, remembered where all the parts and wires connected, and kept track of all the screws and various other parts while taking the laptop apart and putting it back together. The only part I know I might have made a mistake on is the order of the two large chips in the bottom of the computer (Maybe the RAM? I don't know what they're called...taken out at 1:05 on this video:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulecDVBnDwc. Would switching them actually change anything?)

Now my computer turns on, but the screen stays off and after about a minute it starts beeping 4 times in a row every 5 seconds. What could I have done wrong, and what are my options now? I did a full backup right before disassembling, so worst come to worst I guess I'll have bring it to a repair shop and they could fix it and wipe it. Any advice for me, r/techsupport?  




 A common argument I've seen for the validity of Jesus as the Messiah is that he was unique in certain respects. Usually, the twin claims are that he committed no sin and that he performed many miracles, including raising himself from the dead. Putting aside the former claim, (because of the unverifiable nature and that there is no reason for a Messiah to be sinless), why do the miracles make Jesus unique. The Bible clearly states in Deuteronomy 18 to be vigilant against false prophets who will turn people away from the proper worship of God. These prophets will "perform signs and wonders" to prove themselves, and God tells the people not to trust just because they perform miracles.

So why are Jesus' wonders used so often as proof of his status as the Messiah/divine? And are there any other reasons to believe that Jesus was a unique human?

We can also discuss the sinless claim if someone brings a verse to show the Messiah must fulfill that requirement. Please don't bring into the argument that he was God as well, because not only is that impossible to argue about, it doesn't answer my question. 














 Can anyone explain to me what exactly is the reason that minhag is taken so seriously in the orthodox world? I've heard people talk about minhag like they do about kashrut. Some really weird practices are justified as minhag, sometimes so much so that people refuse to change them. Why is it taken so seriously both culturally and halachically? 

I went to Orthodox day school, so feel free to give me sources. 









 Is there any knowledge of specifically how parasites control the behavior of their hosts? What parts of the brain do they affect? Do they block or add neurotransmitters? Does the method change among species? For example, I know some wasps use venom, but fungi or bacteria probably use different means. Links or books to read further on this topic are also greatly appreciated. Thanks! 




 I recently bought Awakening, and absolutely loved it. I owned Path of Radiance and played it when I was younger multiple times. Then I bought Radiant Dawn some years ago and played once, and now I'm playing it again when I rediscovered FE with Awakening. Once I'm done with RD, what game(s) in the series should I play next, and how can I get it? I have a 3DS, a DS, and a Wii, and a computer (:P). Thanks! 




 I was a really big Pokemon fan when I was younger. I played the first and second generations to death, starting multiple games over again so I could experience the thrill of training my pokemon from scratch and beating all the gyms for the first time. I then tried my hand at emerald for a it after it came out, but for some reason I couldn't really enjoy it and stopped after a while. I did the same for Pokemon black, and even almost made it up to the Elite Four, but I didn't understand a lot of the new pokemon, moves, or any of the background stuff. 

I just got a 3DS and a copy of Pokemon X for my birthday, and I want to play and understand, and enjoy it! I'm really excited about the new generation since it seems really immersive. I'm not really interested in the competitive scene nor spending hundreds of hours breeding the best pokemon, but I do want to know how to better train the ones I catch! 

So what's new? What are EV's, how do battles with multiple pokemon flow, did B-down to catch a pokemon ever actually work (I'm still going to use it anyways!), etc. Educate me, please! 
























 The half blood prince, fantastic? I hope you're being sarcastic...

or some reason they decided to jump on that and focus more on the relationship drama and less on the actual storyline.

whelp, that might be why. The relationship drama is the storyline, even in the book. 




 This probably wouldn't be in the shulchan aruch, but is there any discussion on what a mourner who goes to two different shacharit services on the same day should do? That is the closest to this situation.

 




 You can say that as many times as you want. I have it open and don't see that. I'm in siman 55. Can you point to where it says that saying kaddish with less than 10 is assur, or where saying a d'var sh'bikdusha with less than 10 is assur?  




 You are saying it is assur, but I'm looking at the mishnah brura and it doesn't mention assur anywhere. Is it preferable to say it with a minyan? Yes. Must a minyan say it? Yes. But nowhere does it say it is assur if there is not a minyan. Again, it's great you're studying it, but I haven't, so if you could please cite your sources it would be very helpful. 

This doesn't even get into the difference of saying it to yourself versus a public declaration among less than ten. 




 Alright, I see  , but no assur. I also see no discussion on what a single person can or should do. I also see that a Katan does suffice for the tenth, unlike kedusah, meaning this is on a lower level. (Actually, I think I might have misinterpreted this--it's unclear whether these are laws for just kaddish or also brachu, kedusha, etc.) From my limited knowledge is seems totally fine to say the words of the kaddish by yourself, but it does not yotzei you.

Maybe the Aruch Hashulchan discusses it, but I can't look right now. 




 Don't worry about it. We're having an argument on the fine points of a specific law.

A minyan is ten Jewish men by Orthodox standards, ten Jewish men and women according to more liberal movements. Those of us who are more liberal/egalitarian also say there is no difference between men and women in this.

Edit: Just because the most stringently observant on here say certain things doesn't mean they are always true for everyone. :P 




 One second, the kaddish doesn't even have Hashem's name. What is the difficulty? 




 thanks. Unfortunately I only have the Mishna Brura and Rambam here.

Edit: Oh, you are referring to the mishna brura! stupid latin letters... 




 Is there a source? Also, remember the principle of teaching when saying God's name. 




 Some synagogues do sell them. If they don't, they can definitely refer you to someone else who does. 




 That's very appropriate. :) 




 It's not a mitzvah to do it, but I do not believe it is forbidden.
 




 Hmm, I thought you said Lamarckism, and Lyskenkoism seemed to be a political structure that used it as a basis. So to be clear, I'm talking about the heritability of acquired characteristics.

I'm also a layman, so I can't say very much; I'll explain it simply with more technical words in parenthesis, since I don't know your knowledge level. The basics of it that I know is that experiences (stimuli) over the course of an organism's life can change whether genes are turned on or off (expressed). Since genes are usually just codes for a cell to make proteins, expression simply means whether or not the specific proteins are made.  This is mostly caused by the way the genome is folded/held together. 

For example (and this might be relevant for people here), the gene for lactose tolerance in adults can frequently stop being expressed (i.e. the protein it codes for stops being make) if you stop drinking milk. So an adult with lactose tolerance who does not drink milk for a few months would find it difficult to start again because there are no more proteins to break it down.

The theory is that the expression of genes, in addition to the genes themselves, can also be passed down by parents. How exactly it works I'm not clear about. It's not Lamarckism in its original and expansive form, but it does share similarities. 




 Well, an altered version of it has been making a comeback recently. 




 You can also say the Mourner's Kaddish if you want -- it's a prayer in Aramaic, but most prayer books have it transliterated. You might or might not find it meaningful.  

Edit: [Here's a link](http://www.jewfaq.org/prayer/kaddish.htm) to the Hebrew, English, and transliteration. [Here is wikipedia's explanation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaddish#Mourner.27s_Kaddish).

Edit: Also forgot, is there any site or sub were I can learn more about my heritage?

That's what this sub is for! Read the wiki and people would be happy to answer your questions. I also recommend jewfaq.org

 Look up the 48, 67, and 73 wars. A ceasefire was only put into place once Israel started winning. 




 There are two different interpretations. 

'We must never again allow a genocide to happen."

Vs.

"We will never again be like sheep led to slaughter." 




 And I'm saying that this "he" refers to all of mankind. My support is that seed is always plural, and that both Adam and Eve are referred to as you when it refers to all their descendents.  




 It doesn't say anywhere that the "suffering servant" would be pierced, nor that the suffering would "bring" salvation. 




 Other biblical texts clearly identify the snake with Satan (i.e., Revelation)

Fan fiction, doesn't count.

The text specifically says that your head shall be crushed -- not a generic snake, not the snake's descendant, but that particular snake.

It also says you to Adam and Eve, and that clearly refers to them and their descendendants. Why is this different?

There seems to be a particular descendant referred to by the "seed" -- it's a singular "he" who will do the crushing, etc.

"seed" always means "descendents" in the Bible. Is there a time it is not plural that you can point out? 




 Oooo, oooo, I know this one! Hocus, pocus, [balobocopypaste](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/29dzp2/why_is_jesus_always_depicted_as_being_white/cikvnv9)!

Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react.

Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.

Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here. 




 Vanilla morrowind was good for its time, but modded morrowind is amazing. This is from someone who only started playing a few months ago. 




 Has Hamas not essentially declared war on Israel? Or did they provoke Israel into declaring war on them?

Hamas' declaration of war with Israel is in its founding document. This recent violence between Israel and Hamas began with Hamas firing rockets, yes.

Either way... if one side continually declines a ceasefire, how can the other be held accountable for any casualties of war? Surely Israel would prefer to not catch any civilians in the cross fire, but if their opposition chooses to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with civilians, then what option do they have?

Good question, ask all the Hamas supporters around here.

That said, I'm disappointed in Israel's strategy; why not attempt to use Hamas' tactics against them? Spread the word that Hamas leaders/militants only intend to use your (civilians) lives as sand bags and blast shields. Consistently and constantly plea with civilians to flee. Offer salvation and safety on the border, risk Israeli lives to save those that are disenfranchised by the Hamas - let the world see Hamas firing on their own fleeing peoples... on IDF trying to help civilians leave.

They've done all of this, doesn't change a bit.

On another note, why not attempt to gas such a densely populated area, where there is no realistic escape for your enemy, with a sedative? Get in, grab civilians, capture Hamas militants. Rinse and repeat as needed. Can't we do something besides lobbing bombs at one another? Not much of a farcry from trebuchet times - where the Homo Sapien species barely understood... anything.

New headline when a 90 year old tragically dies: "Israel is gassing Gaza!"

What is Israel doing to ensure civilian's safety, aside from giving them notice that they're about to drop bombs all over their neighborhood? Is it so much to ask that the IDF stick their necks out? What if Gaza was packed with Israelis instead?

A house is typically only bombed after a call and warning "knock." The IDF *does* stick its neck out -- it doesn't have to send soldiers into Gaza, it could get everything done by air, but with severe civilian casualties. Then you would see an actual 80-90% civilian casualty rate. 




 No, no, israelnationalnews is the best website ever!!  




 The Zionists were a terrorist group to the world.

Citation needed. Zionist leaders welcomed in the US say otherwise.

The Zionists believe in one state for Israel and control of the entire holy land.

Citation needed.

After the British left the Zionists turned their focus on controlling the holy land.

No, there didn't happen to be a civil war right before they left and armies invading afterward.

They gained control by forcing native Israelites out of the land if they weren't Jewish.

Yes, yes, that's why Israel has always had a 20% Arab population, right?

The people forced out still felt a right to the land since they were on it since the ancient Hebrews.

Arabs have only been there since the 7th century; they're proud of that conquest too.

Six Day War occurred and people ignored that the new Israel state has grown past the partitioned lines it was. given.

"Occured" is such a lovely word, isn't it? Allows you to ignore why Israel conquered those territories.

The people in Gaza form Hamas in order to get the land they felt was theirs.

This ignores all history between 1967 and 2005, lucky you. 




 The battles 60+ years ago were to kick all the Jews out. Hamas is still fighting for that. 




  The grievance being that the Zionists when taking over Israel forced the native Jews and Arabs to assimilate or out of the state into Gaza and the West Bank and thus created the tensions that aren't being absolved today.

This is so incredibly simplistic to the point of being wrong, I don't even know what to say. 

I think that just because Hamas is bad doesn't make the grievance any less important.

Their grievance is that there are Jews in the area at all. If you agree with that, you are condoning them. 




 So are they fighting today's battles or the ones from 60 years ago? 




 Ah, so you agree with them? 




 You do realize that there was no siege until the rocket fire started? And that it will end once the strip is demilitarized?  




 They call all of Israel "occupied." Get your head out of your ass and realize they want to ethnically cleanse the area of all Jews.

 Probably less so than ynet and jpost, which are posted here all the time. 




 And when people ask why everyone can't just stop shooting and live together peacefully, this is the answer. 




 They didn't publish that any more than reddit publishes self posts. The guy signed up for a blog before, and spewed some racist shit on it which the editors removed and then banned him.
 




 It wasn't even an op ed, just a random blogger who they host. 




 How about the fact that they didn't publish anything anymore than reddit does? The guy signed up for a blog before, and spewed some racist shit on it which the editors removed. 




 jewfaq.org is good for reviewing things you might have forgotten, but it doesn't go in depth. 




 As long as there is a giant explosion and darkness when it hits the ground. 




 No idea. Maybe the yeshivish people here can explain it? 




 So your argument is that the method of execution (stoning) is immoral? Again, define your argument. 

Your example is like saying you forced someone into an electric chair and electrocuted them, and by the laws of Oklahoma that is ok. :P That's murder, not execution.

That's a moral execution, which isn't murder, and the bible didn't say to put the person on trial, but to just do it, so no laws broken.

Notice the example given has a trial first. The bible does say there and elsewhere that there has to be a trial before an execution.

Job is clearly an allegory, and one way of saying that we cannot necessarily find a reason for suffering. 

How much longer until you agree that stoning is a torturous way of ending the life of another person,

I disagree.

and that it wouldn't be ok for anyone to order it be done.

I agree! 
 




 Oh, not a full takeover, but a limited one just near the border. The "I keep bombing you as long as you shoot rockets" and "I will keep the blockade until you get rid of the rockets" are pretty strong cards in my opinion. 




 Nope, it was the air force, not the navy.  




 No it isn't - you don't get a free pass to kill as many human shields as you like. Proportionality still supplies. You can't kill a hundred civilians to destroy one rocket being hidden in the same building, for example.

True. Most people mistake a war's proportionality for a strike's proportionality though. I have yet to hear of one airstrike killing one hundred civilians.

Isn't that just a tu quoque?

No, since this is said to people calling for Israel to stop bombing. Why should Israel be held to a standard that no other western country is? 




 You try doing so from an airplane or drone 1000 feet up in 15 seconds using heat imaging. 




 I'm not, I'm letting you define the scenario. Who are you aiming at? 




 Right so what we should stick to Palestinian endgame of forcing all the colonists to go elsewhere and the rest of the Jews to live as second class citizens, seems fair.
 




 And if you shot at someone you would be arrested. 




 What about all the Arab states that kicked the Jews out? Should they be forced to take them back too? 




 Then yes, you are using the family who lives in that house as a willing or unwilling human shield. And who are you firing at? Soldiers of a dictator are very different than civilians of an enemy state.
 




 Israel said that it targeted a militant site, and it was thought that the kids were Hamas fighters running from the shelling.  




 Israel won't accept it though. Since Israel withdrew voluntarily and is ready to return to Gaza if need be, Israel holds most of the cards. 




 What was the other peace process in which Bill Clinton intervened?

Oh, [right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords), that [one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_David_Accords). 




 The boys on the beach was a mistake, and Israel admits that. Unless it was fired knowing that they were all children, then it's not a war crime. War is brutal, and maybe Hamas shouldn't have started this one.

And none of those three schools were actually targeted. 
 




 Maybe just maybe there were actually many rockets fired from Gaza. 




 120 years' worth 




 Responsible for the action, yes. Responsible for the result? It depends. And certainly the person putting the civilians in harm's way can't be the one doing the complaining. 




 The rule 97 that I quoted from. And what is your point? Proportionality does not relate to overall casualty figures, and I would like you to prove that israel is not taking precautions in attacking. 




 You're just avoiding the question. What should Israel do in that scenario?  




 You can't blame the opposing force for killing the civilians you're hiding behind. 




 Yes, but you would usually not keep a crowd of civilians behind you while you are attacking, for two reasons.

1. You care about your people.

2. The tactic only works when the other side also cares about not killing them.

I'm not disputing hit and run tactics, but doing them next to civilians, whether they are willing or not.. 




 Um, yes it is? It might not be permanent, but it is being used for military purposes. 




 I'm pro-Israel and I mostly agree! I would like to comment on a few things though:

With that said, they have at times acted carelessly and overly aggresively. Their response of "Hamas is worse" does not suffice, because a legitiamte state should hold itself to a higher standard than an extremist group.

The response is not "Hamas is worse" but "since Hamas is using human shields, we are not at blame when those civilians die," which is true, legally, under the Geneva Conventions. You might argue about the morality, but it is not a war crime 

Also, Israel is usually saying "but America/the EU does the same/worse with lesser threats" which I have yet to see a coherent argument against.

The non-Hamas Palestinians and their more moderate leaders such as Fatah/PA are caught in the middle and the ones who deserve our sympathy

Eh, the thing is that Fatah is utterly corrupt and is just out to line their own pockets. The civilian population which does not take part in hostilities or riots is in a much worse position. 




 Then don't blame the opposing force of a massacre and genocide when your civilians die along with the freedom fighters. Usually a resistance is trying to minimize their own civilian casualties, not make more die.
 




 Then don't blame the opposing force of a massacre and genocide when your civilians die along with the freedom fighters.
 




 Yes, it is.

It can be concluded that the use of human shields requires an intentional co-location of military objectives and civilians or persons hors de combat with the specific intent of trying to prevent the targeting of those military objectives.

http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter32_rule97 




 Then don't blame the opposing force of a massacre and genocide when your civilians die along with the freedom fighters. 




 Ok, Israel lifts the blockade on Gaza and two months later there are 20 rockets every day, and several suicide bombers have gone off in towns neighboring Gaza. Now what? 




 What's your point? 




 And all the reports of them doing otherwise this time are hogwash? And that still doesn't address the fact that setting a military installation near civilians is also using human shields. 




 That is what they are doing, as per this article. My personal opinions are beside the point, I would just like to know if he would be using human shields like Hamas does. 




 If you were in Gaza now, would you hide behind ~~a mound~~ an apartment building, pick up a ~~gun~~ rocket launcher and take pot shots at Israeli ~~soldiers~~ civilians?

FTFY. 




 1. They're in danger as long as they're in Gaza, not because the firing has stopped. 

2. Other journalists are still in danger if they are caught doing similar things.

3. Hamas might take action against the news company still in Gaza or in later reporting, even if that specific journalist doesn't return. 




 Nope.

 [Look at how many bases are not embedded in cities among civilians!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Israel_Defense_Forces_bases) 




 What would a proportionate response be, then? 




 No one sane in international politics thought it was a false flag operation; the two suspects were known members of Hamas and went missing since the day of the kidnapping. A week or so into the search, Israeli intelligence said that the suspects probably acted at their own initiative without a direct order, but that Hamas leadership did encourage their operatives to carry out more kidnappings.

Did Netanyahu use it as an excuse it to round up Hamas members in the West Bank? Absolutely, but that doesn't make it a false flag.

Hamas, if it knew that one of its leaders in the west bank was arrested, might have refused the ceasefire that Israel wanted now that the tunnels are destroyed. Israel revealed it today, after 12 hours or so of the ceasefire being in effect, because they did not think Hamas would take action now that the whole world would blame them for further escalation.  




 Israel bombing a rocket launcher near a home makes the fact that civilians died, though tragic, not a war crime unless casualties are disproportionate to the military gain 

edit: for the specific military strike, not the whole operation/war. 




 [The reaction to Israel using soldiers instead of airstrikes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2b8bd7/at_least_100_palestinians_from_a_single/) 




 A 1:1 civilian to militant casualty rate is the best in modern warfare. 




 By this logic, you are encouraging Hamas to continue these tactics since they know Israel won't fire back. In this case, what should Israel do instead? Because no population will allow its government to sit and do nothing while rockets are being shot at it. 




 Ok, that's step 3. There are three different levels here:

1. When is killing justified? Answer: War, self-defence, and execution.

2. What are valid reasons for executions?

3. What are valid methods for executions?

You have to agree to the first before we go to the other two. 

This is debate is about specifically the commandment from god to not kill, and the commandment from god to kill.

And my original comment was saying that **there is no commandment from God to not kill.** the verse says do not murder. You can argue about whether it is humane or capricious, but it is not a contradiction. Saying so only hurts your argument. 




 And this is why the Israeli censor is sometimes important. If this had come out three weeks ago instead of after the ceasefire, Hamas might have taken more drastic action. 




 They're still in danger, unfortunately. 














 You're arguing that killing during war, self-defense, and execution is morally acceptable, because god ordered it.

No, I'm arguing that these are the acceptable situations in which killing is permissible the world over and always have been. The argument over whether these laws should carry the death penalty (and why) is the second argument, but the other one has to come first. So do you accept the death penalty and other forms of killing are permissible (if not ideal), at least for this argument? 




 [But it is in line with the reporting of past conflicts.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_\(2008%E2%80%9309\)#Casualties) 




 No, it just means that Israel is better at protecting it's civilians. I would not want to see the number killed with no sirens, bomb shelters, or Iron Dome. 




 Are we arguing the death penalty now? Because that is a different subject entirely. We can do so if you want, but it's not the same argument as you had above. 




 It is an execution if the person is brought before a court of law and tried according to [procedures outlined here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_and_corporal_punishment_in_Judaism). Otherwise, it is murder. That's why the story of Jesus stopping a stoning is so nonsensical.  




 Ground invasions actually have worse civilian casualty rates than air strikes do, since artillery shelling shelling is much less accurate. What if that strike team was surrounded? Shells would fall on that entire neighborhood, killing dozens. Would you condemn Israel for that too?

And that justification is much, much better than the the justification for Hiroshima and Nagasaki: We won't be able to conquer Japan because there would be no support for mass troop deaths, so lets bomb the fucking civilians and kill thousands instead of attacking soldiers.  




 Ratzach = Murder

Harrag = kill

Executions, war, and self-defense are killing, not murder. It's the same thing today. 




 I don't care about the points, but about the post being visible. I don't complain if it's above 0. 




 Journalism before video was a thing, you know. There are still these thing called "written articles" which /r/worldnews sometimes links to. Amazing, right? 




 God never says not to kill, but not to murder. If you're going to argue this, do it correctly. 




 And this is how polytheism started! :P 




 Innocent civilians will be killed and the world will be up in arms not matter what, so let's not risk soldiers if we don't have to. 




 Allow them to take it and report on it once you leave.  




 No, the bible is infallible because words are used consistently. In this example, "face to face" is always an idiom for "directly," while "see My face" is compared to "see My back." I don't need to deal with the NT. 




 Yes, the work they do is dangerous, but they should say that Hamas is intimidating them. 




 Then they should say so instead of meekly parroting Hamas' talking points. 




 So they dutifully parrot Hamas' talking points instead. Not doing so isn't Pulitzer worthy, in normal circumstances. 

If they're scared, they should say so instead of covering it up. 




 It really shouldn't be. They were just at the right place at the right time. There should be many more of these types of reports coming out of Gaza.

Edit: really guys, downvotes? I'm not saying they need to have the balls to film it while their in Gaza, but they should at least report on it once they leave. If they are staying silent outside of Gaza for "access," then they are acquiescing to this war crime.

 I'm not in DebateReligion, so I'll make this quick. "Three persons, on God" is polytheism *according to Judaism*. The range of permissibility is from "complete idolatry" to "acceptable for non-Jews."

 The same reason that as an American (or a citizen of any country), you have rights and responsibilities that others, immigrants or tourists, do not have. If David's mother is American and he is born in another country, he gets citizenship as soon as he visits the nearest consulate. You are Jewish the same way, it's just more automatic and cannot be revoked.   




 Everyone has to go through a period of atonement/spiritual cleansing. Non-practicing Jews just might have a little bit more to go through. 




  What is the purpose of saying he must technically keep the commandment if his actual obligation is waved?

How it is treated in Jewish law. Suffice to say that until he learns about it, it doesn't matter.

Humans are humans and if you WANT to be in this covenant, that's one thing. But, from my POV, it's completely unfair and unjust that my friend Daniel is given expectations because of his blood.

His blood and mine are NOT significantly different. Of course there is a difference, but the difference is not significant. Making it significant is a fabrication. A method of keeping clan-unity in the ancient world. We should, as species, move past this obsession with blood-line. It's unhealthy. It's unfair. It's unreasonable.

This is ancestry, not "blood." The blood is pretty much the same all around. 

It comes down to a different system of values. Post-Enlightenment western values places a lot of emphasis on individuality, while traditional Judaism has more of a balance between community responsibility and individual desires. As an atheist, I assume you support the idea of moral relativism, of which this is a manifestation. 




 All I'm saying is it's ignorant to think that we can say with absolute certainty that the Big Bang is fact, same with evolution.

That is the Orthodox definition, yes.

Why would I follow this rule if I believe that not worshiping an idol would be bad for me? Also wouldn't Trinitarian and Latter Day Saint Christianity count as idolatry?

It is forbidden for Jews to practice it, but it is probably allowed for everyone else.

Would saying "I think the god of the Tanakh, New Testament, Qur'an and Book of Mormon is not worthy of worship" count?

Debatable, but probably not.

I don't eat anything with meat as the primary indigent but I do eat stuff with meat as a secondary indigent. I don't think eating an animal while alive will be a big deal to me. Also it is unsanitary.

Eating meat, in general is allowed. But with the cruel conditions many animals are raised today, there are actually arguments to say that this is being violated. Also things like shark fins which were torn from the animal before it dies.

What does this exactly mean? And what law?

A system of justice that society chooses for itself. 




 There is no eternal hell in Judaism, and no one is cast into "damnation."  




 Calm down. The situation you're describing is, in Jewish law, equivalent to someone who is taken captive. He is still technically has the obligation to keep the commandments, but he is not liable for any of them since he doesn't know about it. 

I'm sorry, but BONDAGE that is inherited by children and their children and their children is UNFAIR. My friend Daniel is a free agent and he decides who or what he forms a pact with.

This is a different discussion entirely. 




 And the residents of the south will continue to suffer in the meantime. It's time to end this now -- it's the best chance that we're going to get. 




 But giving in to demands without anything in return is even worse, since it further legitimizes Hamas among the Gazan population. 




 A forced cessation of hostility because they ran out of rockets is much better in the long run. This ceasefire only allows them to restock...again. 




 A ceasefire? Now? I would have been a favor of one 10 days ago. But now Hamas has few rockets left, the majority of people near Gaza have already left, and the international community's attention has turned away. Now is the time to continue until they run out of rockets and force them to demilitarize, not to **reward** Hamas for shooting rockets.

  Micah 5:2 But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times. 700 B.C.

This is not a prophecy that the Messiah will be born in Bethlehem, but will come from the clan of Ephrat near Bethlehem - i.e. the line of King David.  




  Matthew did not "make up" whatever ancient writing he was referencing to say this.

Matthew either made it up or referenced something of which we have absolutely no record today. Considering that the Jewish canon, including the prophets, was already codified at the time, I think the former is more likely.

 To add to your analysis, Israeli news is reporting that Hamas has around 25% of its rockets left, but only a few of which can reach beyond the area right near Gaza. 




 His dissent is pretty much in line with every major news source out there. 




 What is your answer? Currently it's "Iron Dome doesn't work!" Then why are there no injuries? 




 I am looking for a reason you can give as to why there are no injuries or damage in Tel Aviv. So far you have failed to provide one.
 




 ok my bad. Israelis are the most awesome, most educated, most aware people in the world. They know everything before it happens.

If you lived in Israel then, you could see that the Patriot system didn't work, which is what people said at the time. If you live in Israel now, you can see that Iron Dome is working. How is this so difficult to get through your thick skull? Why do you believe a bad analysis of grainy images of eyewitnesses you said the true thing both times?
 




  maybe the iron dome is 90% effective...but maybe it's just like with the patriot system and it's all bs.

Again, my parents looked out their window in Tel Aviv, and saw the damage being done by the scud missiles and how the Patriot system was failing. People look out their windows now and see how Iron Dome is succeeding. Are you going to respond to this point? 

The point, that you clearly missed, is that what people THINK they know today, typically turns out to be wrong when they actually look at the details later.

And proposals vs. weapons systems being fired are two totally different things. At least the analogy to the patriot system is actually legitimate even if it shows how Iron Dome is working. A vague "wake up sheeple!" isn't going to convince anyone, you know.
 




 You're right. I was just distinguishing between batteries (of which adding more in the same area would be mostly redundant) and multiple interceptors per battery, which are already used. 




 They are adding more batteries to different areas to ensure complete protection, for example if the north and south are both attacked at once. In 2012 there were 4 or 5 batteries, I think know there are about 10 and more are being added. There is also much more support for the "Iron Beam" proposal which would stop short range mortars. 




 yet the reality we found out after the fact was that is worked less tahn 10% of the time.

And Israelis', who were the ones who were supposedly protected by it, knew during the conflict that it wasn't working. Just like they know now the Iron Dome is working.

you gotta open your mind and ears.

Fine, point me to the best. Your argument currently comes down to "wake up sheeple!" 




 Your argument would hold water if you were talking about not developing it in the first place because of the cost. You're saying this:

yes that's the problem...what people "~~see~~ want" and the reality it's used for are quite often different.

We can see what Iron Dome is doing *right now.*

look at the patriot act - after 9/11 every single person was gung ho for it because it seemed like it's protectingus.

now? it's the most unpatriotic thing and a tool for all of the recent NSA abuses.

And people warned about that when it was passed. This is a weapons system, not a law or planned war. Your analogies are awful. 




  The evidence for this is that only 22 people have died in over 15,000 rocket attacks over a decade.

This is where you analysis absolutely fails. Yes, people have died in roughly the same numbers because of other security measures, **but injuries and damages** are massively down. That is not pure chance.

you are raging so hard you didn't realize the 10% figure is the number of the effectiveness of the Patriot system. The same system that the US claimed is 90% effective...similarly to how Israel claims the Iron Dome is effective.

we won't know til later - like we found out about the patriot system.

Except Israelis knew during the Gulf War that the patriot system wasn't working by looking out their windows, just like they know the opposite now.

 




 That was the argument as to why not develop it in the first place. But the vast majority of the cost was paid in development and now it is working extremely well and people feel much safer, so no. It is actually a kind of celebrity. 




 I would more compare it to stopping a sexual assault, but whatever floats your boat! :P

I'm not here to argue with shitheads online, but to refute them so that other people reading are more informed. Trying to change posters' opinions here is useless. 




 now I understand why the bias and selective processing of information

Now you know why people like Iron Dome so much. It is not statistics released by the IDF, but what people see. 




 Mind if I copy paste this into my analysis above so we have a coordinated rebuttal? 




 I save my downvotes for Hams supporters on worldnews. Why I go there is still a mystery... 




 Israel doesn't have an military-industrial complex like America has, so the comparison to the patriot missile is bullshit. 

I agree. Take a look at the democracynow discussion. Guy makes some incredibly good points.


What are his best points? I can't see any very good ones? 




 This is an edited letter I sent to a news publication earlier to show why the 5% figure is complete bullshit:

I can definitely state that Iron Dome's intercept rate is over 5%. 

**Statistics and Analysis**

First, his analysis is not new and is mainly based on Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, not the most recent conflict, and was done using civilian photographs. (Weirdly, I can't find the original analysis itself, only reports of it.) It is not clear in yours or other articles whether he is stating that only 5% of total rockets, or 5% of rockets that Iron Dome fires at, are intercepted. A clarification would be nice in that respect, since the IDF only fires the Iron Dome when the missiles are headed to a built up area, since it are so expensive to use.

[Here is Ha'aretz on the 2012 analysis.](http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/how-many-rockets-has-iron-dome-really-intercepted.premium-1.508277
) Two articles([1](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/528916/israeli-rocket-defense-system-is-failing-at-crucial-task-expert-analysts-say/
), [2](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/528991/an-explanation-of-the-evidence-of-weaknesses-in-the-iron-dome-defense-system/
)) in the MIT technology review have been published about this. I believe the article you linked to is based on the second:

[Here are the latest IDF statistics](http://www.idfblog.com/blog/2014/08/05/operation-protective-edge-numbers/
) of rockets fired at Israel (note: as of 8/05):

* 3,360 rockets fired 
* 2,303 hit Israel (70%)
* 475 hit gaza (14%) 
* 584 intercepted by Iron dome (17%)

If the IDF claims an 80% success rate of Iron Dome, that means:

* they fired at about 730 (22% of total rockets)
* and missed 150 (5% of total rockets) 
* Most of the 2000+ rockets that did hit would have hit open areas, but not all.

5% effectiveness related to total rockets would be 150 intercepted, which is 20% attempted interceptions, nothing to sneeze at though still not great. 5% of attempted interceptions would be only about 40 rockets. Which is it?

**Refutation**

Second, His analysis is pretty easy to refute, not by looking at grainy images, but by looking at warnings, damages, and casualties. There have been over 30 sirens in the Tel Aviv area; unlike your article states, most of it is apartment buildings or high rises, not open space. (If you want to see a city with open space, go to Be'ersheva.) As far as I can tell, and I have been following updates closely, there have not been one rocket reported to actually hit the area. How is this possible if Iron Dome only intercepts 5% of the rockets it launches at? The expensive, Iranian made Fajr-5 missiles actually use a targeting system and would be aimed toward civilian populations.

And the places further south (Kiryat Melachi, Ashdod, Ashkelon, etc.) seem to have much less damage than they did in the 2008 war. You're the reporter, not me, so this is something you can research, but my impressions were that it was unsafe to at all live in those areas during that war, and there was a lot of destruction. This year, there have been very few reports of damages, while I remember almost every day I heard about rocket damage in 2008 and 2012. 
During this operation there have been only **3 civilian deaths and 22 injuries** (according to the IDFblog which seems to have stopped updating in mid-July, but I can't imagine that it is more than 50 injuries) while in 2008, according to Wikipedia, **600+ were injured** (4,000 rocket attacks) and in 2012 it was **almost 300** (3,000 rocket attacks). This is another place your analysis and/or the professor's fails; yes, the deaths are about the same, but as he says deaths are unlikely anyway. However, injuries and damages are dramatically down while rockets, and more targeted and damaging rockets, are up. This would make no sense if Iron Dome wasn't working. 

*TL;DR A 10-20 fold decrease in injuries, and massively reduced reports of damages, is absurd if Iron Dome wasn't successful.*

**Feeling of Security**

Furthermore, anyone on the ground can tell you there is a large difference between this war and 2008. There is a different sound if a rocket hits the ground, a rocket explodes on the ground, or an Iron Dome intercepts a rocket. There have been multiple reports of shrapnel falling from destroyed rockets. People feel much safer because they notice my points above. **Iron Dome is not a celebrity in Israel because people see it shooting and the IDF publishes statistics, but because they can see that the destruction from Hamas is severely limited now that it has been deployed all across the south.**

**Conspiracy**

Final point: It would require an incredible conspiracy to cover all of this up (/r/conspiracy levels!). There are lots of people working or have worked on Iron Dome, and they would have to prevent anyone from speaking about its failure. If there has been damages from rockets hitting buildings, like the one that killed 3 in 2012, it would need to be covered up. If there were no rockets fired at the Tel Aviv area, the only other conclusion from my above analysis, then fake Red Alert sirens would have to be ordered and then covered up. None of these are plausible.

Is it possible the IDF is exaggerating somewhat? Possibly. But nothing on the order of a 5% of claimed interceptions or of total rockets. We would be seeing entirely different results on the ground if that was the case.

Edit: Your points are addressed above as well, but to show specifically why you are wrong:

it has more to do with the crude and shitty rockets being used than the Iron Dome.

Then why are damages and injuries down so much if Iron Dome wasn't working?

 Also, the thing that keeps Israelis safest isn't the Iron Dome - it's the incredibly effective and well deployed early warning system that allows people to find cover quickly

Absolutely. But even with this system over 600 people were injured in 2008, and we are seeing nothing on that level today. Statistics of damages are much harder to find, but it seems to be a lot less as well.

Studies have shown that even a 5 second warning, allowing someone to lie/duck down and cover, increases surivability by 60%+ Makes sense if you think about the explosion and trajectory of debris.

**Survivability =/ Injuries.** Yes, they might survive, but could still be moderately or severely injured. Your analysis doesn't explain the discrepancy. 
 




 From what I've read, it's mostly three and four. There are already 3 potential interceptors fired from each battery before the rocket hits the ground, and each interceptor costs $20,000 to fire.

 




 He hasn't been following the news. The 90%+ figure was only at the start of this conflict. 




 So you should support Al-Qaeda and not Hamas! 




 This article was published today and the Jerusalem post is a pretty major news source. 




 Everyone remember this: Hamas first says one thing to the west and then another thing to their supporters. The same will come out about the death count in Gaza once everyone has stopped paying attention; innocent civilians will magically transform into heroic martyrs who fought to the death. 




 Is there any statement in American law which says the purpose of American citizens is to follow those laws? 




 Ok, now I'm just confused what your response has to do with my original comments... 




 Operation Protective Edge is not Operation Brother's Keeper, and both occurred with provocations, not randomly. 




 Yep, just correcting because these kinds of misconceptions can be easily propagated, as the history of christianity shows. 




  The kitzur's issue with flames not being at the same height (and the Ah"S would probably agree) is the latter. 

Except aren't these requirements still valid whether or not a shamash is present? This seems to indicate that the problem addressed is showing that the 8 as one unit but still distinct from one another, not that they are a unit which are separate from the shamash.

 




 Also, KJV, not JKV.

Thanks.

The simple fact that a significant portion of rabbinic texts are written in Aramaic and are, in many cases, considered more authoritative than the original text of the Hebrew Bible itself undercuts the notion that Hebrew was the authoritative language.

Yes, all true. But you said:
the only accepted version of the Qur'an is one that is in Arabic, whereas this is not the case with the Hebrew Bible

scriptural texts written in English...are all just as authoritative as the original languages

This is what I am disputing, not that there are many texts written in other languages in Jewish and halachic literature. You are giving the impression that the **translation** of a Hebrew Bible into English, or a Talmud into the same, is as authoritative as the original text.

 




 Are either of these two things incorrect? Jewish converts to Christianity are not expected to follow the Torah, and from a Jewish viewpoint worshipping Jesus is idolatry.  




 Yes, but it is an addendum and not part of the requirement. It reads like this:

Do not follow a man who leads you astray by telling you to worship other Gods, even if he performs miracles, for God is testing you by sending him. 




 Yes? All 8 candles must be recognizable as being lit together -- but the shamash must be separate so as not to be confused, which I see as the biggest problem here. Neither of your sources here seem to address that. 




 Just so that there is no bad blood between us, I never downvoted you. 




 From what I have learned, it is the commonly held belief in Rabbinic Judaism after the fall of the second Temple. Even among the modern, liberal streams of Judaism translations are much more acceptable but not authoritative, especially compared to how the JKV is treated among many Christian sects. Do you have a source that says otherwise? 




  If that's true provide a reference for it.

Start with [this wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_antisemitism). Click on the links on top of the subsections for expanded explanations. This is all burned into the Jewish collective memory.

Reference?

See the link above, specifically the arguments among early church fathers and the Spanish Inquisition. If you want to read more on the latter, google conversos, crypto-Jews, and marranos.
 
Considered them backward? I thought they were tortured and killed? (Really, can you source any of this?)

Augustine is the most commonly given example. Again, read the opinions of early church fathers on Jews and Judaism. 




 Oh, I do that too. I mean that when the problem continues afterwards and they continue to complain without doing anything. 




 three months is "right after" now? Who knew! 




 Of course, I meant that the shamash flame must be different in some way from all of the others. 




  For many Christians and Jews, scriptural texts written in English (or French, or German, or Swahili, what have you) are all just as authoritative as the original languages. 

I do not believe that this is true in Judaism. The original language is always the best, as far as I have seen. 




 Would it be possible to delete the old bigoted posts? 




  Go talk shit about israel

Yeah, this might be the problem. Criticizing and talking shit are two different things. 




  we are held to a higher standard than the believers of the OT

How is not following the law being held to a higher standard? 




  In other words, jews follow the letter of the law and christian follow the spirit of the law.

The spirit of the Law is quite clearly to follow the letter of the law, which christians don't do.
 




 The person would be considered raised as a captive. That means that he would be breaking commandments (which is based on actions, not intentions) but would not be held as liable for what he did. 




 I meant that just because someone in Gaza tweets something expressing sympathy of someone in America does not mean that Hamas doesn't want to kill them. 




  Peter didn't do either of these two things. Or if he did, she me where (again, chapter and verse). 

1. The Church, which is based on Peter's teachings, told Jews to not follow the Law.

2. Peter and the Church both told Jews to follow other gods (Jesus). 

Fits pretty well.
 




 For very good reasons. 




 such as, that there were foods that "defiled a man", in the sense that they, of themselves, had the power of making someone unclean.

Why do you think that Jews ever taught this?

 I said above that Peter never instructed any Torah observant Jews to disobey one iota of Torah. Nor did I suggest anywhere that Jesus told any of his Jewish followers to disregard Torah.

Except it is your church that has multiple times, over the past 2000 years, given Jews living in its lands two options: convert or die. And if converted, they could not keep the old laws under pain of torture and death. Even when they were suffered to live, the Church considered them backwards for keeping the Law that God enjoined upon them, and celebrated converts from Judaism (who, incidentally, were not required to keep the Law).

 




  Jews were used to seeing Gentiles as "unclean", like dogs

Why do you think this is true?

These cleanliness laws, as well as circumcision, built up a "wall of separation" between Israel and "the Nations".

Why did God make a law, which he called eternal, only to tear it down a few years later?
 




 *Christianity* doesn't make sense. Don't tar all religions with the same brush, though. 




 Correction: A false prophet is someone who causes people to transgress by claiming that he is receiving a divine message. Performing miracles is not part of the criteria. The Torah just says that miracles should be irrelevant to the message. 




 There are only two things God created that can be classified as evil: death and free will. Just because God created them doesn't mean he cannot be good. 




 I guess hit on = attempted rape now... 




 From what I learned in high school, the most important thing (edit: in this case) is that the Shamash is distinct. Both could work if you place a visibly different candle in the shamash holder, I think. 




 Then can you also explain why women *do* it? "Venting" without wanting a solution, ever. Sympathy without a solution, like the person above said. 




 Send a few "summary" paragraphs and ask him out on a date. Otherwise it's a little bit too much in the beginning. Use the rest to guide how you would like to express your feelings in person. 




 Could you list/link to all the army ranks in Hebrew with the english equivalents?  




 You mean the one that the US took over through an aggressive war less than 200 years ago? Mexico has a right to that land!  




 They'll be faulted regardless of what they do. 




 Hamas =/ individual Palestinians 




 Many of the alleged conspirators are Hamas members who were released as part of the Shalit deal and then rearrested. These are the same people that Hamas is demanding be set free as part of the ceasefire negotiations.

I wonder how this will change the Hamas-PA unity pact which has still been technically in effect throughout this war? 









 From a previous point of mine about why Isaiah 53 is clearly about Israel:

Isaiah 53 is very clearly talking about the Children of Israel, though it is obscured by the way Christians separated the chapters. If you look at 52: 13-15 (which is the same section that starts with chapter 50), you can see that the prophet introduces a "servant" in third person. 13 says that the servant will be exalted, 14 that (in past tense) "marred beyond man is his appearance," 15 that (in future tense) how kings and nations will react.

Then, in 53:1, the narrative shifts to the perspective of those kings and nations, who are talking about the servant after he has risen and exalted. In the past, "he had not form," "he was despised," etc. But now "He has grown," "he might see offspring," etc. Then in the second half of verse 11 the narrative shift back to prophet, who describes the servant a bit more.

Now how is it possible that, during the time the prophet was speaking, Jesus was already marred, and that nations were appalled (did this ever happen?). Only in the future will the nations say "As one who hid his face from us, he was despised, we held him to no account." Did they ever say this about Jesus? On the other hand, (the house of) Israel fulfills all of this! In context with chapters 52 and 54, if one is a believer, one could see the prophecy be fulfilled today. If you read the entire section, chapter 53 is actually the pivot between a mourning Israel/Jerusalem and a joyous one, it makes sense why Israel would be referred as a "suffering servant" here. 




 Me? No. Do some commentators? Yes. 




 Judaism's view: It's a debate whether it was slight of hand or actual magic.  




 Do you want me to go through these and show that each and every one is, to quote from above, "not a prophecy at all, not a messianic prophecy, or taken so far out of context that it's purported to mean the opposite of what it actually means?" 




 How is this the letter of the law? Sabbath mode just disables the electronic displays and auto turn off. It's the exact same thing as having a constant fire going. 




 It'd be like saying that we can worship other Gods now

Funny thing us, that is what was done with Jesus and all afterwards. 




 What's interesting is that the symptoms described by galphanore are very similar to the real ones after fasting/long term malnourishment. But the latter are a lot more...insidious, I guess? 




 It's too goddamn long and not much happens.
