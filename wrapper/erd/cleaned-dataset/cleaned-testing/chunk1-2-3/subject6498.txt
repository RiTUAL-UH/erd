 Japes? lolwhat? 




 Even though he is seated a good distance from the marrying families, Bern Cinder met Lorella Royce's eyes through the thick crowd and thought he glimpsed a smile. 




 I would like sigil #7 please! Oh, and this is my first roleplay ever :P 




 wooooooooooooooooops. Correcting. 




 **House Cinder has been considered outlaws in the Vale for hundreds of years. Decendants of** the first men and named after the volcanic caves that has been the center of a fortified hill by the Cinders since the time of the dragons. Some say the volcanic rockfomations (which has give the house it's name) surrounding the cave were created by a stray dragon.

House Cinder were awarded **Strongsong** recently for their **unexpected loyalty** to the Lords of the Vale in the War of the Ninepenny Kings. Lord Cinder managed to still the warrior's want for the spoils of war when the still outlawed mountain clans rode to war with Lord Ormund Baratheon. Lord Cinder knew war was coming to The Vale. It was just a matter of time. 

**The current Lord Cinder**, **"Burk"** recieved the hand of Marinera Corbray. The youngest daughter of Ser Arman Corbray who is 8th in the line of succession to Hearts Home. Together they have recieved two sons aged 13 and a daughter of 7,

House Cinder's **military forces** consists of 2000 fierce and utterly fearless warriors wielding two-handed weapons. 100 mounted noblemen and 900 archers/crossbowmen

Staying true to the vows made to the Lords of the Vale would grant rewards to the those who were patient. 




 With the last hobbit movie out I'm putting a request out there.
A loyal Tolkien-fan with love for the LotR movies and sharp film editing-skills should cut The Hobbit trilogy into a single movie with a max length of three hours.
Are there any aspiring editors out there?

 Tinfoil? Check
It has begun. The **government** has begun. Starting with kids. They will make them feel it is alright that someone is watching you, making sure you behave. 




 Going on an assignment for Tommen. Goes on a killingspree.  




 I'd say wait if you are an honest man. It has released in some countries (here in Sweden), and english is soon to come. They are good though. Really good. I can really praise the comic too. Really well done. 




 Now that. Is what I call a final stop for this particular train. Spring 2016, here we come. 




 I'm surprised no one have asked grrm on his blog.  




 If this is a cheap trick to score sales for The World of Ice and Fire.... Nerdrage is going to happen. We do not have the patience for this kind of shenanigans. The book is nowhere to be seen and millions of people are waiting eagerly.

But my hype is active so long as George doesn't make a firm statement on the notablog. 




 12th day will be The World of Ice and Fire promotion. I am so sure of it. So sure. (fingers crossed) 




 I think the Bronze sword points a little to some kind of forgotten blood sacrifice done by the first men. 









 It means Winds of Winter confirmed!
What would you expect the odds to be for a sneak release 3 days before christmas? Huh!? Huh?! 




 Maybe **We do not sow"** should be "We **could** not sow" 




 Of course I have talked about it with his parents. I thought it would be an interesting topic to talk about though. And so it has proved to be!

 




 I was thinking **Princeless** would be too. If anyone here has a daughter they want to introduce to comics, that would certainly be something to look at.
The theme fits well with today's gender equality-discussions. 




  Am I missing something here or do you not know about the HBO show?

Wait, what? No of course, but I don't think that the universe is at all near to be fully capitalized. Just you wait Wheemix. Just you wait. 




 Beautifully put, and I must say I agree. When this saga is finished (touch wood) I believe it will expand and be regarded as probably the greatest fantasy series ever written. 

**And the movie-franchise will be crazy.** I expect there to be a bidding war over this series, and it will be big. We might even se a red wedding. 




 Is it just me or is it justifiable to pirate the books to get digital copies when you already bought the books? I would say is.
Pirates must not discuss it here, but we can upvote.  




 You make really good arguments..
Is it known if there is a really easy way to gain access to all the avalible comics of Dunk   Egg? 
A Physical copy is a better gift, but they do have two ipads, so a digital copy could make due..
 




 Yes, **I have realized I at least have to re-read them and see in what context and with which words the adultery is described.** 




 I myself discarded that as trying to make some extra bucks because they only just mentioned it when they released the new edition.

It was obviously not supposed to be a part of the story when it was written in the 1980's. Ten years before GRRM even knew that Jon Snow know nothing. 




 With risk of playing the proud uncle. He's really smart and clearly interested in fantasy. He has read and listened to both Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and the Harry Potter-series. Narnia too if I am not mistaken.

Thank god his father is a true nerd. 




 This is so helpful!
It's the mixture of those three that makes me doubt if it's a good idea.
I', fairly certain he will love the story nevertheless. 




 Thank you so much for your helpful post! The Graphics Novels would be perfect (great adaption btw) aside from the fact that his English is not that good. 
**Perfect moment to brag about Swedish english!**

He can understand spoken english fairly well, but written it's a different matter.
The book contains all three novellas though, so I might have to re-read them. Which is not a hard task really. 




 It sure is a tale that resembles Westeros a great deal what I have heard.
And Old Nan's hints about Ice Dragons makes it so much more difficult to decide.

But, since it was written ten years prior to **The Song** I take it as a standalone universe, even though they obviously have common themes. 




 Yeah it was the violence I felt unsure about. There are some nasty duels. I think I might have to read it again to make sure about the most gruesome parts.

The Ice Dragon is not Westeros though. Right? And I think it is for younger audiences even thoough he is not to old for it. (doubt even I am to old for it) ^^ 




 **A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, the perfect steppingstone to introduce young readers to the universe?**

I just visited my local bookstore and after I had drooled over "The World of Ice and Fire" for a minute I noticed this book:

http://s.cdon.com/media-dynamic/images/product/book/book/image0/riddaren_av_de_sju_konungarikena-martin_george_r_r-27265257-2403511085-frntl.jpg

This is the Swedish version of "A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms". And I now recall GRRM stating that the book might get an early release for some countries.

**I got an idea that it could be a great gift for my nephew.**
But before even asking my sister if it's ok I wanted to ask here if you think the novellas are ok for a 10 year old child to read.
He probably have more hours on **Skyrim** than I have, which certainly contains a great deal of violent.

It was a long time ago since I read the Dunk and Egg stories, so I just wonder if anyone here knows if there it contains scenes that might not be ok for a child to read? 
**I thought it might be ok, since there are no sex-scenes in these stories what I can recall. Yet. And the story has a protagonist about the same age as my nephew.**

Would love for someone with a good memory to help me out. 

**This could be the perfect gateway-drug for kids today to grow up with George R R Martin's universe, and if they are lucky A Dream of Spring might release just in time for their graduation**  




 Arya in the Mercy chapter was a highlight for me. I have longed for a more grown up Arya who uses her sexuality to lure her prey. 




 Boy, would that be just after world peace on my list! 




 I noticed a funny post on twitter by GRRM, and not wanting to be too creepy , I thought some speculations are welcome this cold november. Shall we throw in some wild guesses for when this gigant will arrive?

I also noticed his freshly **(?)** updated tour dates on his website which shows a lot of booked events almost once a month. I thought he said he was sitting down not making tours to make more time for writing?

**I think tWoW will release winter 2016** (secretly hoping for summer 2015)

feel free to rate this to the bottom of the internet if this is to much 









 Episode 7: **"Edd, fetch me a block"**

That is all I need.
 




 **I suggest rereading.** If you are a show watcher mainly and havn't heard of the theories around R+L=J you should definitely read the first book again. 
You will have missed too much cut material around what happend in Robert's Rebellion.

Audiobooks are great as well. Roy Dotrice is a king.  




 I'd like The Hedge Knight and the rest of the novellas about Dunk to be a miniseries like HBO.

Robert's Rebellion would be so exciting as a feature film.
Barely any recasting. **Charles Dance** returns for coninving Tywin? 




 Yes he is. And this is my theory.

Bran will be able to weirwood.Net-warg Duncan the Tall because he is Hodor's great grandfather. And therefore fulfilling his life's wish of becoming a knight in some sense. (And what a knight).
This is an idea of my own that came to me when I read a passage in "The Sworn Sword" that read something like this: "It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior. Was there a god of fools?".
It could explain why Dunk acts recklessly without thinking. And also fits in to some great lesson given to Bran by Bloodraven. Bran gets to meet Brynden Rivers in his physical prime and learn about the history of Westeros culminating with the mystery of Summerhall. 




 Arya Stark or just Arya would be pretty mind blowing. She hasn't been referred to as that in the chaptertitles since I don't know when.

It would be time to go home when her name pops up. 




 Dunk and Egg. Try the graphic novel version. It's refreshing. 




 Naah. There were like 24 Brandons with some Bolton rebellions along the way. Rest assured I think the current Bran of Winterfell will learn a lot about his family's history in **the next books.....** 




 The Walk of Shame. 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6%C3%B0r

One theory is that Hr. Brother to Baldr.
Baldr is immortal except for his weakness to mistletoe.

Baldr was tricked by Loki to kill Baldr with an mistletoe arrow.

This could mean Bran safe in the cave where magic protects him from the magic of the Others represents Baldr and Hr is Hodor tricked by another part to kill Bran.

 




 I heard something Kristian said a while back, and that it was him taking a break from the show this year. Have that been changed to Bran not being in it at all?

That sucks then! Heard something about **flashbacks** a week ago. 




 Leto would be the best. Honestly. He's my mancrush. 




 So, we basically have confirmation that Dany will get het whole A Dance with Dragons storyline. (maybe a chapter or so less)

But where will the other characters end up?
**I thought I would fill up this OP with the best theories.**


* **Tyrion** - Ends up practically where book 5 ends. fAegon and JonCon is cut, meeting Ser Jorag and possibly meeting Dany.
* **Bran** -  Confirmed to be stalled one season to catch up with the book with character progress possibly happening behind the scenes.
* **Arya** She should begin her training this season if she is gonna go back to Westeros at the end of season 6. Maybe reaching the Mercy-chapter by the end of this season.
* **Sansa** Filler material. Hopefully gathering the support of the knights of the Vale.
* **Cersei (Whole Kings Landing plotline)** - Maybe as far as the Trial by Combat. Possibly a Maggy the Frog flashback.
* **Jaime** (We know he's going to Dorne, so this covers that plot. Hope for some Bronn development)
* **Brienne** (  Pod) IF they have not cut out Lady Stoneheart completely, she will surface in the last episodes of season 5, threatening to hang Brienne and Pod. if LSH is cut. Your guess is as good as mine what Brienne will do.
* **Jon (The whole North plotline)** - Is elected LC, stabbed and possibly ressurected by end of this season. **GOD. I can't wait for unsullied to get this cliffhanger episode**
* **Sam** If they go with him leaving he probably will be meeting Arya in Braavos before season 5 is over at least, then onwards south.
* **Iron Islands** - Chances are this story will be cut save for Ashas involvement in the North.

Any strong feelings on how they will end next season? I managed to predict season 4 mostly, with some things they cut out and such.
 




 Hopefully another 50 years. 




 The Girl in the Fireplace is a good choice. Especially if he's in to history. 




 Trevligt :) Yeah I feel they catched most themes very well and I'm glad they didn't change any of the names. 
Will probably watch every episode once they're all out. 




 Well yes of course, but they have sure taken some inspiration from the movie as well. That is clear and something I am happy about. Watched that film once a day as a kid! :) 




 **Sanzoku no Musume Ronja**, the japanese Anime, co-produced by Studio Ghibli have aired a few episodes.
Based on the swedish movie **"Ronja Rvardotter"** And the book by the same name written by **Astrid Lindgren** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrid_Lindgren

I really like it so far. It is fairly true to it's swedish inspiration, something that surprised me. My favourite scene is in the second episode. But I like the original swedish version of that scene far better.
link to the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdAkrQFO-xQ

Have you watched the Anime yet? It is avalible with english sub to stream on some shady streaming-sites and it should not be too hard to find. 









 Please, a link. I am to lazy to find it myself. 




 It's pretty cheap on Ebay! 




 I challenge everyone to team up with a buddy and beat 07:07 minutes boss attack mode!

If you beat my thirteen-yearold selves best time I give you a cookie!

 




 My favourite game Spawn seems not to be supporting VGA if the indicator is the icon at the back of the case.. :(
Might invest in an adapter and scaler if I get money for it. Seems kind of expensive. 




 How much difference does the VGA adapter make quality-wise? Considering I have a 92" projectorscreen I could use some better quality. 




 **Anyone else remember this awesome game?** Well, it's not that awesome now when I come back to it. But as a ten year old, this was the coolest thing I played. Nostalgia is a powerful feeling and this will always be one of my favourite games.

I just played a game of Spawn with my sister, and when playing boss mode I came across the best multiplayer time with my cousin.


We beat the game in 7 minutes (!)
Me and my sis managed in about 25 minutes. Does me an my cousin have some kind of **world record** or something? It's crazy fast.

Pic or it didn't happend: http://i.imgur.com/SGWhyy7.jpg


**Anyone else want to share their record time on multiplayer bossmode?**
 




 Probably Elio Garcia who posted it and it will probably have to do with the eminent release of TWOIAF.

 I don't think **GRRM** uses twitter.
He made Elio set up the account because there were so many fakes with his name. 




 Did everyone notice when he almost spoiled something?

When talking about Aegon the Conqueror and the dragons subjecting the people of Westeros, and with the dragons gone, ultimately they didn't feel the Targaryens had any power over them anymore.

"Of course Dany...." and then he turned in his seat and changed subject. 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6%C3%B0r

Balder is Bran.
Enough said. Whole book spoiled. 




 It was late, I quit when I got into a circularized orbit.

I am bringing (except for the gigant launch system I am pulling) a Science Lab, A lander for Gilly, and a small lander for Eve (with two impact probes).

This ship makes me realize I really need to upgrade my computer. 
I can basically hear my processor **screaming**. 




 (Spoilers All) 
This is my most tinfoil-branded theory. But hey! **That's what we do.**

**Bran** will be able to weirwood.Net-warg **Duncan the Tall** because he is Hodor's great grandfather. And therefore fulfilling his life's wish of becoming a knight in some sense. (And what a knight).
This is an idea of my own that came to me when I read a passage in **"The Sworn Sword"** that read something like this: **"It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior. Was there a god of fools?".**

It could explain why Dunk acts recklessly, childish and without thinking soemtimes. And it also fits in to some great lesson that will be given to Bran by **Bloodraven.** Bran gets to meet Brynden Rivers in his physical prime and learn about the history of Westeros culminating with the mystery of **Summerhall.**

I know its pretty crazy. But I have wondered why GRRM began writing about **Dunk and Egg** in the first place. They are obviously important to the story. And since he began around the release of **A Clash of Kings** he probably already had Bran's fate decided since long ago.

 The most interesting shit about that chapter is her killing Raff the Sweetling on her own initative, and at the end the text refers to her as "ARYA". 
As opposed to her being refered to as "Mercy" for the entire chapter prior to that. I interpret is an a transition where she is beginning to go back to her original identity. 




 Incestanity and Cersei's fucked up raising of him.

 10 000 ships I seem to recall right? Just had to (a) 




 I only know I like season 4 the most. It's like an origin story when they open up the new firm! 




 That's really cool!  




 I'm certainly no pro. But don't you need some regular rockets for when you have escaped the atmo? :)

I am nowhere near trying to take off Eve myself. Just got back from Duna in one piece! 




 It looks amazing! The perfect circles of moons and planets would be a little stretched though. Probably something you can oversee :) 




 The Arryns are Andals? No? But maybe you mean the mountain clans? Totallty first men-descendants. 




 You can totallty fly up there with a dragon, though :) It would be cool to have a Harrenhal 2.0. With Littlefinger roasting juicy mutton chop. 




 His own squire named Payne? (pain)? Assigned to him before the siege he is afraid to die in.

I think it would be that, but I'm not sure. 




 Also, **I know how to do it myself**. But after hundreds of takeoffs and rendevouzs I am sick of it. The fun part is constructing large interplanetary vehicles and stuff. 




 Considering this post is at the top of Reddit, and it is such a valid request, I would see it as a terrible sign if CA doesn't take the advice and release a demo of some sort. 

**They won't get a preorder from me if they don't release a preview! And I know friends who feel the same.**

They aren't very careful with their reputation. 




 I had to go on 9gag and 4Chan.
And now I'm probably gonna cry myself to sleep. 




 Exactly. Probably the best movie ever to show someone unfamiliar with anime.

And one more thing. Studio Ghibli's movies always has this realistic feeling. People act like normal people would, living ordinary lives. Nothing has this unrealistic flawlessness that comes to mind when you think of Disney's films. (oh I do have some Disney favourites, fear you not)

Roger Ebert nailed it. 




 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095327/?ref_=nv_sr_1

Halfway in I was completely sure it had to be based on a true story. It had so much emotions and experiences that would be completely alien to someone who hadn't lived through these events.
I love books and films based on true stories,  and decided to look it up when the the movie would end.

**And then the ending came.**
I think I cried halfway through the credits, and then I looked up the book and the true story. (semi autobiography)
It is written as a tribute and an apology.

And apparently the ending is shown exactly like it happend IRL.

The most powerful movie I have seen this year. 
**If you havn't seen this film. Do it.** 




 The Stories of Dunk and Egg is the story where Bran gets to live his dream of being a knight. Warging Hodor's great grandfather, meeting Bloodraven in his physical prime.
The Sworn Sword: "It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior. Was there a god of fools?"
Remember where you heard it first. 




 * Tyrion claiming Casterly Rock. 

* Daenerys saving the world, in some manner.

* Arya getting to cross off some names on her list. And preferably some Bolton and a certain Frey.

 Yeah

Focus on the ones that is NOT "test this" or "test that". 

 




 I reinstalled everything with MechJeb as the only mod. 

NOW IT WORKS

Time to see if my old savefile will work, watch a lot of docking tutorials on MechJeb rendevouzing and docking! :)

Thank you all for you help. This is what internet is all about.

 




 I'm gonna try a fresh install install tomorrow, really gotta go sleep. 
Thank you for your help! I will get back when I have reinstalled everything. 




 Yeah I tried them, but it won't execute them either. :( 




 It's too large to host at pastebin. Dropbox, why didn't I think about that lol.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/lm2vx550b0tzv7r/output_log.txt?dl=0

here you go. That's a lot of text.. 




 No change :(

http://imgur.com/Gm2TC8z,BdBRgfw#1

Thank you all for answering.. Would really like to get this working.. 




 I posted a thread, but didn't get a sollution, so here goes.

Installed MechJeb for the first time. But it doesnt execute maneuver nodes.
It gets to the target altitude, firing stages and doing gravity turns.

But when it get out of the atmosphere, nothing more happens.

http://imgur.com/GbtAZlt
picture is past the node and on the way down. 




 No it doesn't make any corrections after leaving the atmosphere and change to "Autopilot Status: Coasting to circularization burn". 

Just goes past and downward after that. 




 I had a complete ship with batteries and solar panels, but when it didn't work the first time I made a new save file in sandbox to see if it was a technology problem. Didn't put that much effort into the test rocket. 

The speed was probably due to "limit to terminal velocity".

Added stuff electrical stuff, and changed the turn shape a little.

New picture shows altitude at 62 000 km. past the node at 75 000 and now descending.
Still not working. :(

http://imgur.com/GbtAZlt 




 It will be remembered, but if he doesn't finish it, it will not be a good thing to remember. 

If he finish it, R+L=J and he connects all the dots and make the ending really epic I think it will be as big as Lord of the Rings. 




 Yeah, after the first try I thought it would be the electrical. But after 10 tries I am pretty sure it's not that...

http://imgur.com/pf2aLfG 




 SOLVED!



I'm tired of launcing and rendevouzing so I just installed Mechjeb.
Got it to work, it is great at getting in the air.

Although it won't work entirely. It creates a node at apoapsis, but just goes right past it without buring. 

Autopilot Status: "Coasting to circularization burn". and it says so until the shit hits the fan (ground).

I have RCS, 3 kerbals and a little fuel left in my mainsail and a third stage ready. I don't get it because it manage to drop first stage, do the gravitational turn and set the manuever node at set orbit altitude.
But it won't execute the node.

Anyone have any ideas? This is so frustrating! 




 I read Arya, Jon, Daenarys and Tyrion chapterwise from book 3 - 5. It's awesome to do when you already read them a couple of times.  




 Catched that last week during my re-listening :) 
People who discredit R+L=J are just.... well. Stupid. 




 I **hate** being one of those persons posting a thread with the name of the next book in the title. But I have no choice.

Just read an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor) where he said:
"**We** have a season off and we have a year's hiatus, solely because I imagine our storyline is up to the end of the books," 

The whole interview here:
https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/24890664/actor-kristian-nairn-reveals-the-other-side-of-hodor-on-game-of-thrones-themed-dj-tour/

As he said "**We** have a season off" I guess that means his gang. That be Hodor, Bran and Meera. Oh, and Brynden "Bloodraven" Rivers ofc.

They totally have rushed Bran's storyline and I would never have suspected they would pause his story for a whole season, that seem really weird considering the huge twist at the end.

if they now feel they should take a break with Bran for a season because there is no more book material. Is that an indication that **The Winds Of Winter** could well be released 2015? Maybe in time for season 5 to end, or worst case before season 6 airs?

If there were no chance George would have the book out before season 6 is well under way I see no reason what so ever to delay Bran's storyline at all. Just make him a flashback-machine.

I take delaying of story as a good sign. That should mean they feel **hope.** And that is good enough for me.

However I am glad. I don't want weirwoodspoilers in the show.
And I am sure we will get clarifications from D D what the holdup is all about soon enough. 














 Theory about the powers of the Weirwood trees and Bran's extreme warg abilities.

Spoilers D E

I read The Sworn Sword on the plane just before, and smiled a lot when I read the part where Dunk defies his former liege and sends his soon to be slaughtered smallfolk home. 
The reason for my smile was Dunks monolouge after his outburst:
 "It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior" 
"Was there a god of fools?"

"not the warrior" felt a little out of place, and got me thinking towards the old gods. 

We do know about someone who can control people. And we know someone who wants to be a Knight more than anyone. 

This could well be wishful thinking and another crackpot theory. BUT IF Bran theoretically could Warg someone in the past (weirwood magic seems pretty craycray you got to admit) do you have a better candidate than Dunk the lunk, thick as a castle wall? 
I bet we will know if it's the jetlag, or if I'm on to something in Winds of Winter and or The Shewolves Of Winterfell. 

In any case, I think Dunk and Egg is really important to the story of the novels. He began writing the novellas between agot and acok I believe. 

My first ever Post on reddit BTW!  
























 Att du ens svarar hr r som att du ber om mer... Haters kommer att hata. Lr dig vnda andra kinden till. Du hr aldrig av oss som tycker att ni har intressanta videos p Youtube och uppskattar ert engagemang otroligt mycket. De som gr ljud ifrn sig r kanske 1  av alla lsare, att att mata dem med mer r verkligen motsatsen till taktfullt. 




 I have a feeling all the haters are jealous because they are so close with George. People often call them arrogant and stuff, which I think is misinterpretation because they do know a whole lot of stuff that we don't.

**Not to say my countryman Linda has not made some really clumsy and/or rude statements about things she shouldn't talk about in public..** When you have a whole fanbase watching, you should feel some kind of responsibility to keep moods up. Responding well to criticism is not her strongest side it seems. 




 Wow... Is that the described size? He feels a bit big.
Awesome picture tho' 




 What platform are you planning to make it for? :) Desktop or Web? 




 HBO has taken breaks with a lot of popular shows. I just wish they would do it again.
Two or three seasons of Dunk and Egg after introducing them with TreeBran would be spectacular..

They seem stubbornly firm on not taking a break though. 




 If u don't feel like read it all. Absolutely. I've done it for tyrion, Arya, and The Wall and Mereen. Only asos and forward. Though.  




 Would be possible fo'sho'. But haven't Bran thought about Meera that way before?  




 How did it go? 

I have introduced close to 10 new people, new to advanced Board Games, though they are fans of the shows and the books. 

And even though it takes several playthroughs to get a good hang off all the rules, new players seem to get a basic knowledge and after 3 or 4 rounds (if they are not afraid to ask their questions when they wonder about something). Past those rounds they can place their orders and such without any problems. 




 the largest part of tToB-cards adds no bonus/+1. There are only a few +2 and +3, and I really like that you can get fortification, sword and the skull, which can make the losing army still kill one enemy unit. 




 Actually not a very bad theory. 




 Paralyzed from the waist down means no boner and probably other problems with proreation. I believe that is a medical fact. But I would be glad with a second (qualified) opinion. 




 Not sure if you are shitting on my wall of text or if I have made your **head spin round, right round.** 




 If you are to believe to sub, I'd say if not over. Close to 9000.

Yeah BR barely counts but you are correct. Will be exciting to see if any others are secretly Targs.  There are quite a lot of those theories.  




 Not live maybe, but after warging Hodor for a year(I'm really bad at how much time is passed) he will know how to do it just as well as he knew all the stones in the walls of Winterfell. If it's possible for him to learn to slip into his skin, staying in the back not controlling him. Particularly since he will know Hodor so well. Well

**I would like to hear theories for the reasons behind Hodor being Dunk's descendant if you don't agree if only to encourage more discussion**.  George would have a good reason for such a twist. Hodor seems like a nobody, just there to help Bran North. Why would the plot need him to be related to Dunk? Someone who probably spent a lot of time with Brandon Rivers back in the days.  




 **Now, are you not prepared to read a long controversial theory.** "Leave now, and never. Come back".

Firstly. Bran and *George R R Martin* shares a huge (apperently gigantic) interest. And that is **Knights.**
http://www.georgerrmartin.com/for-fans/knights/
Also note Bran was the first point of view character George wrote. And in that chapter it was the finding of the Direwolves that came to him Martin first. Warging obviously was a huge part of the whole series from the very start.

And secondly, if you are active here you have seen this theory a couple days back. I have deleted that post, rewritten some parts, and added a whole lot of foreshadowing-material and things that **could** point the right way for this. I must say though. Ever since I first thought of this in August I am getting more convinced the more I dig, so **I need people to read what I have with an open mind and say that this is not possible.**


 nbsp;


 nbsp;

*"Ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow"*


**PREFACE**

This theory that I have polished for months **stands and falls with Hodor being the descendant of Ser Duncan the Tall**, (which I strongly believe he is, even if my own crazy Crackpot turns out false.) **And it would also suggest George's fantastic reason for him being the grandson/great grandson of one of the finest knights the realm ever saw.** Here I would also like to point out that Duncan lived almost 100 years before ASOIAF, and yet we will probably know more about him life than Ned Stark when George has finished his planned material.

I also want to say I am not suggesting different timelines here. What has happened has already happened. There won't be any paradoxes.

And I must say. If my theory is correct. George is hands down one of the most genious storytellers who ever lived. 

 nbsp;

**PROLOGUE**

To get started, here's 7 feet of tinfoil, make yourself a rugged but practical Greathelm and get in the saddle. Because we are are going on an adventure.


I think it's safe to say we are all waiting for The Winds of Winter. Before reading any further. Contemplate this for a moment. Who do you think sends the Winds, little lord?

We can all agree that tWoW will take Bran much deeper into the magical world, and I have always (even before I came up with this theory) believed that will be on such a scale the reader at this point has never witnessed or even dared to imagine. The winds he sends will be so significant they will be an entire aspect of the title of the whole book.
While the whole idea could and most likely will be complete nonsense. (one cup of self-distance every other day is healthy for your mental stability) It would be super-duper-mega-cool if this where to be proven right. So I beg of you. Bear with me for a moment.



**THE THEORY**

The magical abilities Bran possess is undoubtedly incredible. Jojen shat his pants when discovering he could take control of Hodor. Something even he had never heard was possible(?) Bran has had very little real training up to this point, and he has but gotten a few glimpses of what warging and Weirwood.net is capable of. We have seen him go far back in time, watching his father and sending him some rustling leaves, and Theon even heard him speak. I have a I think that will change. Bloodraven most certainly will teach Bran everything he knows, and I would bet he knows more than anyone (for now). How BR will show and teach Bran what he needs to know is totally unknown at this point though, and that is what my theory is all about.

I think he will take Bran back in time to when he was Brynden Rivers. He will get to study the life of a Targaryen prince. And, most importantly (for Bran and this theory anyway) is to let Bran do that from the eyes of a Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.. And what a Knight he will be/was! "Three whole pages for Ser Duncan the Tall.." The few times Dunk is mentioned in the novels they speak of him as one of the most honorable Knights who ever lived.

Towards what ultimate goal is Bloodraven doing this then? He will gain Bran's trust when fulfilling his deepest wish, he will show Bran that he is Brynden Rivers, A Targaryen bastard and not just a dude in a tree. Bran will be the one escorting Branden Rivers to the wall and he will also be at Summerhall, one of the series larger mysteries and the reveal will most likely be some sort of twist. The weirdest thing about this must be that he will fall in love with young Old Nan...

It makes me think Bran might learn to do what Hodor does when he's getting waged. crawl up in a corner where he cannot reach him. But he can vaguely feel his presence. Just controlling minor things that doesn't scare the crap out him.

Now, I have gotten the subtle impression GRRM has a secret love for foreshadowing. So here's what I can remember. Making it all fit together if you tilt your head a little to the left while squinting your eyes.

 nbsp;

**FORESHADOWING**

- "The Sworn Sword", Duncan the Tall: *"Go home! All of you! Back to your villages, and see if the fire's spared your homes and crops." "It was if some God had put the word in my mouth.* **Not the warrior.** *Was there a god of fools?"*

That bold line felt so out of context and the *"Not the Warrior"* -part was what sparked this whole theory when I read The Sworn Sword on my way to Spain for a vacation.

This happens when they are drilling the farmers, and is the most notorious foreshadowing I will present. And it is certainly not the first time Dunk has behaved impulsive. We know Bran is very kind to his smallfolk when serving as "Lord of Winterfell" And I can not see why Dunk would think about the gods in a moment like this. He is not a very pious man what I can recall.

**farfetched you say?** well this is the Hound to Arya: *"Keep your mouth shut and do as I tell you, and maybe we'll make it in time for your uncle's bloody wedding."* I try to remember that this is George, and he is the grandmaester of subtle (subtle) hints.

- **"Dunk the lunk, thick as a castle wall."** That is something he gets called, and often think about himself. We don't know really except it insultes Dunk's intelligence sounds extremely catchy. Him being a big fella makes it really fitting.

 nbsp;

**But let's take a step back.** In A Game of Thrones first chapters, a lot of focus lies on Bran's climbing the Walls of Winterfell. Of course it all leads up to the fall, but it is very explicitly describes how Bran has climbed them so often he knows every stone in Winterfell so well he could probably climb them sleeping (paraphrasing).
With the loss of his legs, he can't climb the Castle Walls anymore which he loved almost as much as his dream of being a Knight. But he get's part of his ability to move back with the help of Hodor. And even though this is a long shot. I can't see "Thick as a Castle Wall" as just a joke on his name. Not after I was taken from behind by "Not the Warrior"


- *"You will never walk again, but you will fly"* It is established in the first chapter of A Game of Thrones that this boy is dreaming of the glory and the tourneys. But it doesn't end there. I would say Bran thinks about his crushed dream of becoming a Knight more times than you could count, and I see that as a reminder that it is something he has not gotten over yet. Bloodraven quote here has the literal meaning. "You will Warg dragons". And it has the hidden meaning. That he will do more than he ever dreamed was possible.

- Bran's last chapter has some crazy visions. Ned basically confirms R+L=J, we get to see Lyanna fighting (I think?), possibly foretelling that she is tKotLT. We see a mystical pregnant woman who wants revenge. And we see The First men about to make a human sacrifice. (All these could and most likely is Bran's family and ancestors)

And then we see Old Nan kissing Dunk... (I suspect) Why is that important? Why are we shown that along with his family? What is Hodor if not just a way for Bran to get to point B? Why does BR first show him members of his family, and then a Hedge Knight secretly travelling with a prince?

- ASOIAF is pretty unique in it's point of view storytelling. And while the complete history of the Targaryens (tPaTQ and tRP) is written as an in universe history book. The Stories of Dunk and Egg is written from the perspective of Dunk.

- The first scene in The Hedge Knight. Ser Arlan is dead, leaning against a tree.
I don't see GRRM just making it so because it's cool. It must have a purpose, like everything else he writes.

**GRRM is planning 9 novellas about Dunk's life as a knight.** He released The Hedge Knight the same year as A Clash of Kings, 1998. And I can not fathom why he would begin writing a separate story at the same time. If the two stories were not heavily intertwined and important for the whole story I don't think he would have written the whole thing as a separate trilogy. (that is what Dunk and Egg will become when it's finished) Releasing it parallel with the novels could implicate it is really important to know about Dunk and what he did when you get to reading the later part of asoiaf.

**Also remember who has the first chapter, and remember GRRM's and Bran's extreme love for knights.**
http://www.georgerrmartin.com/for-fans/knights/

P.S. 
This could actually fall under the same theory as Bran in some way being Bran the Builder and/or some of the other notorious Brandons. Particulary Bran the Burner. His father went away and didn't return. His son Bran the Burner reacted pretty childish to me.. Setting all remaining ship ablaze. That sounds incredibly impulsive and something he probably regretted dearly after, just as Dunk regretted causing the trial by seven.

EPILOGUE

Now it's time for everyone to shoot my imaginative ass down (I put a lot of effort into this, so shoot me gently).
Otherwise add something. (I would like to read every Bran chapter word for word.. Got any knowledge of him wishing to be taller?) **Discussion is all we have until date unknown, and I wish to cherish that.**

**If you don't agree**
If you don't agree with this at all (say so, and then join the discussion about Hodor and Dunk.
I would like to hear other theories about what the point is of him being the descendant of possibly the most honorable knight in history and why that never being discussed! 




 How could I not make that connection... Oh well. The answer is my sigil. 




 I know that. I didn't base this on the data, I based it on my own personal experience. Someone posted it in a comment and I added it because it was a terribly relevant study that seems very well done. 




 lol. My thought exactly when reading a third of all posts. (But we are still here aren't we :D)

I will cherish the day an announcement arrive. This sub will be **on fire**, and the spirits will be as high as the wall,

(**touch wood**(more like banging my head against my coffetable)) 




 What a wingman I have. I was ready to give up that argument! 




 I agree, you shouldn't vote on every post. You should vote if you think the post should to be acknowleged. And you should vote thereafter.

It feels like people think I made this thread fishing for upvotes. I just thought it worth to point this out.
 




 Thanks! So I may be on to something here? I feel people are mostly serious on this sub (hypethreads aside) Ironically enough, this post has lost about 7 golden dragons in the last 30 minutes...

**It truly is useless to try making the world a better place.** 




 Because Baelish says "I know, I know" in a certain way. Could be nothing though, but I made the thread because there are bound to be others I have missed, and someone has certainly picked one or two up. 




 Yeah, of course I hope ^^But I am so tired of being disappointed. People must have thought he would write the next book quickly since the end of aSoS... 




 Oh, didn't think about that! Three is a good number, but it could very well be a little nod towards it! 




 If you think it is troll, absolutely. If you think he is serious, **correct him or let someone with more energy do it. Someone most likely will.** 




 I think they should add it as a possible murder-weapon in Clue. 




 Really?! Well. Yes I could very easlily see that as true. 

I first noticed how people did this after typing up my own tinfoil theory for two hours in bed on my Padphone.... I think I would have at least 30-40 less downvotes if people knew about how to use the buttons.

**And I am pretty sure I'm not the first to have typed up a long post** really putting in an effort to make it readable and easy to follow. Just to have it downvoted because people disagrees, making it slide down the pages much faster. 




 **this is exactly what I mean!**

it doesn't matter if your post is misinformed, far-fetched or dumb! As long as you make your point, don't break the rules or make a rude comment and most importantly **DON'T TROLL** people shouldn't downvote you no matter how stupid the post is. (Well.. There are exceptions confirming the rules)

**And that is what you and many others hasn't understood. 

People downvote posts because they think what the OP asks, states or thinks is misinformed and or just doesn't agree with their opinion.

And all this brings down interesting discussions.

 




 And for some time to fuel the flying flamethrowers. 




 nice one! 




 And he writes slow. 




 Great post, but thinking aDoS will be easy for him to write is pretty naive of you. **If it will truly be the last book** he will want to get everything completely perfect. That's just the way he is. We've known that for a long time.

If he isn't pleased with what he has written, he will rewrite it. And he will do it again, again, again, again, again. Then he will change it completely. 




 I don't see her having time to conquer north Essos before the series end.
I hope she unites Slavers Bay and make it Unslavers Bay. Setting in motion the abolishing of slavery in the entire world. Then leaving for the east. 




 I'd say skipping the first book is the worst book to skip! 




 A lot of cool characters are cut from the books, but I think the writers plant references and homages to characters they had to leave out. My find is the scene when Tyrion and Littlefinger are talking about rewarding Podrick Payne in S03E03

This caught my attention.

T: "did fuck her once."

B: "I know."

T: "But we don't."

B: "I know"

Baelish changed his voice in a way that made me think it was a reference to Patchface. I don't know if it is something everyone noticed but I was pretty astonished!
 




 I am still hoping Benjen will be a prologue/epilogue in a future book. 




 Ilyn Payne would indeed be really cool! Would love to know what goes on inside his head. 
Those chances are pretty slim though I suspect. 




 Hoping tWoW will shatter this with Bran! The magic is one of my favourite aspects of the universe, but maybe that is because it is so mysterious. 




 I would think others who are well versed in english history (I am not) has already made this connection, but I havn't heard about it anywhere.

It sounds to fitting to be a coincidence, particulary since I am pretty sure Richard III is an inspiration for a couple of characters in the series from what I have read elsewhere. 




 Well of course. I was of the impression that was obvious considering it's a 700-page book shown in ten hours.
But it was my mistake I wasn't clear in what I meant. 




 Well, I put it wrong. Almost every scene in the show is take directly from the book. Even the dialogues are pretty much the same.

 




 I agree. It's far more vague in the show though.
Some showwatchers who aren't as hardcore as us hasn't figured out the difference at all... 




 With the shattered sword in the prologue, I think GRRM tried his very best to make it as noticeable as possible ;) 




 When I first saw that name I thought it was a wink to Tolkien and Frodo's alias **Underhill**. That was before I knew that he reffered to Hugor of the Hill though.

Honestly, I still think it is an homage! 




 I'd say "all of this has happened before and all of this will happen again" is already happening. More or less? 




 And I know the reason why that is.

**Upvotes/Downvotes are NOT Reddit's version of Facebook's "like button" (Or the much wanted dislike-button).**

(**Yes, I realize this post could be subject of extreme irony**.)

I think people on this subreddit misuse the downvotes incredibly often. People put a lot of effort in putting out theories, asking good questions and starting discussions about this and that, only to have the posts downvoted to the bottom by people who just doesn't agree.

**And I think that hurts this sub a whole lot!**


So, I provided the rules (not more like guidelines. actual rules) for votes. Which actually are pretty hard to find if you are not an experienced redditor.


- **Please don't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.** Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, **rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.**

- Please don't Mass downvote someone else's posts. If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way to seek out an enemy's posts.

- Upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it. Don't upvote or downvote comments and posts just because the poster's username is familiar to you. Make your vote based on the content.

**FAQ**
 
##24. Someone made a mistake in their post or comment! **Did they even read the book? Should I downvote them?**
No. If you can do it nicely, feel free to correct them and move on. If you cant do it nicely, just move on.


**To my astonishment** jsdistasio **pointed out that this sub is one of the most downvoting on Reddit as a research done about a year ago points out.**

http://blog.getredditalerts.com/reddit-sentiment-analysis/  




 I'd say all of essos payed up together, hiring the FM to make it go kaboom. 




 Warg Bran teached him / Was Brandon the Builder all along. 




 Missing the House of the Undying, "promise me Ned", book Stannis and Patchface? Shame on you :) 




 First book is almost scene by scene. By the third book most things are changed, although they mostly arrive at the same point.

I know you are tempted to skip forward. Some of my friends have, and they have missed so much **You must bring yourself to read the books** though. You need to learn what Daenerys is thinking. Emilia Clarke doesn't portray her character as well as I wish she would.
And Ned's chapters are gold. Just pure gold!

And of course what everyone already mentioned. All the prophecies, foreshadowing and backstory.
First and second book as a lot of those. Particulary House of the Undying is very different from the show. 




 If they are talking about dead men, it's a **wight.**

And every time **Others** enter the stage, everything freezes to ice unnaturally fast. And when they are spotted, the POV-character pretty much shit their pants.* 




 I would say it's slower. But I prefer listening sometimes. Awesome while driving, making the dishes or cleaning the apartment.

**Some people doesn't like Roy Dotrice as a reader though. But I quite love him!**

I would say it is not the best way to consume the series if you are interested in theories and such. You miss hidden details whie listening and can't stay and go back a line to analyze. 




 Quite possible. Had not heard that before. A little like how the peace with Dorne was brokered? 




 Dragons  




 Holy shit. Didn't he burn the ships because his father died or something?! 
Burning your whole fleet seems just as impulsive as punching a prince in the face. 
Would a grown man really do these things?  




 This is certanly new, but I would think there would be at least small foreshadowings and/or hints towards it. I am a bit of a theorizzeeer myself though, so I don't blame you for letting your imagination run wild!

I don't see George introducing people aging backwards more than halfway into the series. That would be super weird. 




 There are probably a lot of huge fans out there who read the books but hasn't experienced the greatness of **The Tales of Dunk and Egg.**

I want to take this moment to fully acknowledge the fantastic quality of the three published novellas and I urge fans who have not read them to do so.

It is a much softer read than the novels and I would say the quality of the stories are spectacular. You really sympathize with Duncan, and I would say they are mostly pretty feel-good. Something that is rare in this universe we all adore so much.

No one of my friends who are fans have read The Tales of Dunk and Egg yet (despite my warm recommendations), and 
I suspect because it is because they have no idea who those characters are (only being mentioned a couple of times in the novels).

**Do yourself a favor and read them. You won't regret it.** 




 Read Dunk and Egg asap. They are weirdly by-looked. 




 Yes. Mace Tyrell is not fool, as the show want's us to believe. And I think their words are really fitting. They are ambitious as hell. Probably more so than the Freys. But they have patience. 




 He was called that because he was the last Dayne King.

It's like "The King Who Knelt" 




 Healthy perspective. 




 Isn't passionate about them? I'd say he is incredibly passionate about promoting new writers in Sci-Fi and Fantasy so editing collections and anthologies seems to really be his thing. And he totally loves Wild Cards what I understand. 




 I'd say the Manderly's have more money than the Starks. But that's just a wild guess. 




 What has happen has already happend. Timelines would ruin everything and will not happen at all. 




 I'll take it! 




 Really!? Didn't notice that one! Anyone wants to find the paragraph? I don't have the book with me home over christmas (It's actually already released as a bound book in Sweden) :) 




 That would make me happy, and sad.  




 You make me feel so shiny!  




 Really?....  




 That's how a season begins though right? :)  




 Read Bran's last chapter when I sees Winterfell. He sees Eddard and it practically confirms Jon Snow to be the dude we all know. 
It's regarded as a fact for a reason 




 No. It doesn't spoil the events it's spoils the history. 

**I'd say reading it as a watcher-only would enhance your view on the entire saga.** It's such a vast world.  




 Stop. I don't want to think about this.. 
II'd like to think the ask George stuff, but mostly I think they are going on it alone. D D knows the rough outline, and considering many of the deviations in S4 I'd say they are doing their thing to get to the end In a way possible for them. 




 Oh yes! Ser Duncan the **Tall** probably the furthest you could come from a cripple, simple minded. Possibly Hodor's great-grandfather or something, making it more (somewhat more) believable for Bran to be able "warg" a person from history. 

We also know he has interactions with BR. 
More crackpot is that it may be revealed in the next book, and that's why Dunk and Egg 4 was postponed and replaced with The Princess and the Queen. Supposedly the next Dunk and Egg will take place in Winterfell/The North  




 So you have reached denial huh?  




 If you read twoiaf you will appreciate the books history references so much more!  




 It is known.  




 Dany says fuck Westeros, I will stay in essos and banish slavery everywhere.  




 Varys. Oh, and Hodor.  




 'cus she wanted to get rid of that bun in her oven before telling?  




 My own precious tinfoil theory spins on your comment a bit. 

It has been stated several, several times Bran wants to be a Knight. And I think Bloodraven will let him be one in the past as a lesson in treestuff. 

My theory actually has one line that vaguely hints at this being true. 
**Please, ask me who the Knight is. Please. Please.** 




 Since Christmas origins from the pagan holiday occurring when the days begin to grow longer again, I would think it unlikely, since there is no way to predict when that is going to be in Westeros.  




 To ensure he would not incite a civil war, he made it doubly impossible for him to take the crown. Probably even more honorable than Ned now that I think of it.  




 Well, Homo Sapiens used to screw the neanderthal, but that was also a long time ago...  




 This here is a perfect example to show you that you shouldn't listen to everything that people posts about this series. No matter how well read they may seem.  




 Brandon the Builder, AKA GRRM's cheap way of explaining why Starks have no naval power. 




 As the gate is on my doorstep, I send 1000 men to strengthen Vale's defences. 




 Your Grace.  









 You have 1000 men from Strongsong my liege. 




 I will send 1000 men from Strongsong to accompany you. 




 There should be a max amount of tradeagreements simultaneously. And there should be resources. Stone, Steel, Grains, Fish, Wood and Gold?
6-10 resources should be enough? Cattle and horses? 




 If this should lead to aggressive negotiations, the Cinder's would be glad to lead the vanguard of the Vale to victory. I am certain the north pretenders will bend the knee to the Starks though. 




 I greet you my lord. Know that the men and women Strongsong stand behind you. 




 The Cinder's of Strongsong stands behind Lord Sheridan of the Vale. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell, and the Starks has ruled the North since before the Andals arrived. 




 [OOC] I am a first time player as well, and has taken a holdfast in the Vale, playing as a "new" family.  




 The Vale will prevail. 




 We have united the clansmen the in the valley of The Vale, what dangers may lie east of the mountains is unsure. A small escort of a dozen knights and squires may seem appropriate for seeing lady Baratheon safely though the east. 




 Lord Royce, we share the same ancestors in the first lords of The Vale, and we salut you as family. 
 




 too soon. 




 I will try this out. Hope fore some good developments in a week or so ;) 




 With the growing tension in the realm and concidering the incident at Duskendale 276AC. I Lord Burk Cinder of House Cinder wishes to swear fealty to you, Lord Sheridan. The new Lord of the Vale.
My ancestors have lived in these mountains since the Dawn Age. And we wish you to consider us some of your most loyal bannermen, 
The King has not been seen leaving the Red Keep for 4 years. Stange tales are being told about his mental health. We must stand together to face the times to come. 

**The Vale must prevail!** 




 A rugged, very tall knight from across the table gave him a clout on the ear. And Bern dared not look up to the hosting families. Ever Again. 




 Some southern jester with colorful clothes. 




 Well Lord Cinder has been mindin' his own business, pinching his wife in the ass and laughing at the drunk fool at the head at the table. T'was the eldest son of Lord Cinder who laid eyes upon the fair Lady Lorella. Noone except Lady Lorella notced the incident and therefore no one could blame him for it. 

Or call them Japes or a sign of disrespect of any kind. 





























 I can only speak for myself, but I think the graphic novels are **superb**. Not much differs from the novellas in regards of the text. Though I am not an expert.  




 Patience my dear Padawan. It will all come. So long as HBO doesn't fuck up the rights, or sell them to Warner we are all good. 




 You are keeping a good pace! My tip is don't rush. There are vital information on almost every page, and you only got one chance to read the books for the first time.  




 They had Dragonstone for a long time before moving there. It was the westernmost outpost of the Valyrians.  




 The Golden Company started as Blackfyre loyalists.  




 Casualness, casualness, casualness. 




 No it's more the setting of Bloodraven. He should have one eye with roots digging into his very flesh. He just sat there like a regular dude.  




 Also Doctor Who is pretty overwhelming when it comes to brittish guest actors.

**'t'was a lot more than I realized.**
 




 Benjen is the Nights King confirmed 




 Rhaegar?   




 yes, partially. 




 *"Unreliable Narrator"* is GRRM's explanation that describes the whole "Wylla scenario"
The name of the series "A Song of ice and Fire" should add some thought.  




 Nice thought. Could be they travel past it, and we get a bit of history. 




 Brynden Rivers is Ravenclaw 

Dunk is Hufflepuff

 




 The thought as come across my mind as well.  




 Thanks!  




 YES. But make sure to get A Feast for Crows expansion as well. Vanilla with less than 6 players is a bit broken, but the exp-pack makes the game a 4-player objective based game that doesn't take 6+ hours. 




 The Lady of the Vale will probably open her arms wide when Dany arrives through I would think. It was to Aegon and his dragons Torrhen Stark bent his knee. I think Sansa will remember that. 




 I wonder if they are preparing people to see Game of Thrones at the cinema.. 6 seasons and a movie, anyone? 




 There is also the sun Daenerys remembers. The sun rarely shines in Braavos. 
You should read the Luke and Leia post if you are interested in the theory. I quite like it, although we *have to wait and see* 




 He hasn't lied about his unfaithfulness because he refuse to speak about them as to make any more lies. I think R+L=J is solid. Totally fits the title of the book. What I don't know is The frickin' lemon tree. There are plenty in Dorne, but none known in Braavos. Rain and Fog doesn't give lemontrees a chance.

But if Daenerys was born in Dorne? Is she the daughter of Aerys? Viserys was a miracle after millions of miscarriages (10?)
The whole Luke and Leia post really got me thinking.. I think I will make another as to put fire on the discussion. 




 I watched John Oliver on net neutrality. And he got me thinking. Internet Providers basically has us in our grips. 
I will provide a personal example which I hope others will too.

Watch the very informative John Oliver explain it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU

 nbsp;
**In Sweden**, where I don't think it is as bad as in the US, the status quo is:

*-* 3 or 4 big providers for countryside and suburbs.

 
*-* Around two more advanced providers additionally avalible in larger cities.

My sister lives three blocks from me in a smaller city, separated by a main road. I have access to one of the big ones exclusively, and she has access to the other two.

The one I've got also has cheaper service in student-apartments.

 nbsp;

If one could gather information on avalability you could possibly prove that they have areas of control for reduced competition and therefore possibly *illegal(?)* monopoly on the market. 




 I'd take some *Unsullied*, Dothraki riders and freed slaves for archers, grab an Ironborn fleet that is cruisin' nearby and go straight for The Vale of Arryn. 

Conquer it in a couple of days with my 3 dragons. And then I'd have an inconquerable stronghold from which I send letters saying "Bend the knee, or I will fry you like bacon. **Burnt black.**


*But hey, why not chill in a pyramid?* 




 You should call HBO or GRRM's marketing guys. Use the interwebz to find a number somewhere.  




 Upvote for flair, but well. This is old news on this sub I would say
t'was the redditor Honey-something who discovered the Benjen stuff.

**How much Anne Groell knows about where George is in his process has been disputed by the Maesters for centuries.**
 




 I like your spirit. *But we'll have to wait and see!* 




 Dunk of course.. 

 




 Want to fit this into my own tinfoil of Bran warging Dunk with the help of Bloodraven. 

Sworn Sword: "It was if some God put the words in my mouth" 

Remember how Bran desperately wanted to be a Knight and is told he never will be. 

Well, as it happens Dunk isn't a Knight, and still is the most chivalrous Knight in Westeros?   




 Jaime is going to the Riverlands in the end of the seasons though right?  




 http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0265610/

Her schedule seems a little light, am I right?

One movie completed and a tv series that I don't think have been shooting this fall if I am reading the air-dates correctly.


She is born in Ireland, so she would have reason to be basically on location..
**I have hope**, but I am ready for a dissappointing surprise. 




 Well. if R+L=J, Aegon i fakeon then J = the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, since he is the last male heir to the throne. 
 




 That would be ironical considering how Ned's oldest son does exactly the opposite and well.. 




 That's how I first interpreted it. Now I don't really know. it feels like some old gods magic to me but.. well it's in my titles. 




 Really like this theory.

*But we will have to wait and see!* 




 average would be average health.  




 You'll have to wait and see. 




 The dragon must have three heads.
Daenerys eggs,  Lyanna's crypt and Aegon with greyscale? 
Sure, *but you'll have to wait and see!*
 




 The significance here I would say lies in that you could identify another Warg?  




 The big three. D or J i would guess.  




 Got mit uns!  




 I feel that Bran is not so bad in the books? His chapters are like magic,  magic, magic. Awesome magic.  Show Bran is whiney as hell.  




 Worth noting is that the English version will be **heavily** illustrated. The ones released in other languages this year will not be..  




 AFFC is slow. It picks up but not to the extent of ASOS. 




 I got the black one! Just had to say that. 




 Yeah, visiting Gibraltar Casterly Rock was all I thought about. 
That and the Neanderthals. 




 April 1st right? 




 Maybe! You'll have to wait and see. 




 Coldhands = Brandon the Builder confirmed?  




 Maybe the best casting of season 1? 




 I hate that the door seeminly have been painted white :( 




 I think CH is an old (old) dude. First Men for sure. Maybe a Stark, maybe just nobody. (But probably a Stark) 




 That TES V: Skyrim was a bit influenced by A Song of Ice and Fire is certain. Dragons, The Northerners rebel against the kingdom (empire). Riften is basically Braavos and Windhelm and Winterhold makes me think of Winterfell. 
Oh, and Draugers..

But I came to thinking about TES IV: Oblivion, and Brother Martin is the **illegitimate son of Emperor Uriel Septim VII**, and the last remaining of that ancient bloodline. In the beginning of the game, he is sworn as a munk. At the end, he turns into a dragon.

Am I grasping for air, or is The Elder Scrools very influenced by A Song of Ice and Fire?
**Bethesda was almost about to make a licensed Game of Thrones!**

http://www.vg247.com/2011/09/15/bethesda-why-we-turned-down-a-game-of-thrones/ 









 I do not think they hold a finished novel in ASOIAF. They want that out ASAP. George could be sharing information with his publisher though. It's just the readers frustration he is tired of, right? 




 Why not. We have nothing better to do than wondering about how potatoes got to Westeros anyway.

New editions for A Song of Ice and Fire are releasing in October this year. Which could very well be Harper Voyagers way of cashing in inbetween the wait for the next big payday.

But I always keep a good look on GRRM's website. Particulary the tour-dates.
http://www.georgerrmartin.com/appearances/
The next big convention is The Pacific Northwests Science-Fiction Fantasy Convention which almost coincides with the Season 5 premier date. And after that if follows with Fantasy conventions all year long.

**Let's speculate** Our dream would come true if GRRM announces this April with a summer/autumn release. 

My more modest but still falthering hope is we have the book by Spring 2016, before season 6 starts. 




 Maybe it's 6 books?

*The Winds of Winter Confirmed*?

 




 God I would hate this. And I have nightmares about it happening. **It happend to Half Life 2.** 




 She was young, madly in love and probably naive as well.

 




 "I'm gonna give you a clout on the ear". **so hard you'll fly across the lake."**

SearchDE! "clout" 




 Gave my10 YO nephew KSP for christmas. He love building planes. Well. Even I can't build functional planes, but he loads in a stock one, and mods them. Finding out what works and what don't. 

Children are awesome. Trial and Error has made him capable of landing and starting again. I have high hopes for him being the first astronaut visiting Europa. ;) 




 This is the kind of post that makes me and my accomplishments in this game feel so small. 




 I don't understand these kinds of threads. 
Not saying you can't wonder, but I don't see what's interesting about Westeros having food that originated from the Americas.
**There is a wall made of ice, 700 feet high for christ sake.** Let them have their lemon cakes and potatoes. 




 I suspect he will be Bran's tool. Broking a peace between the Others and Westeros. 
Or he will frikkin' kill all the Others with his burning sword. 




 Kings who ate, drank and fucked around is not something new. I am sure he based King Robert Baratheon on some of the old kings in history who has been known to have a few similar traits as 'Ole Bobby B 




 Well. Benjen should be a candidate? 
Maybe TreeBran aswell? 




 'Ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow. 




 Simplifying. Simplifying. Simplifying... HBO fears viewers will go away from that episode wondering "Well, who the hell is Cat?" 

**I think distrusting viewer's intelligence is the greatest crime of television writing today.** 




 Later Dunk sends the smallfolk home, defying Ser Eustace and Ser Bennis.. *"It was if some god had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior"*..

Bred my theory of Bran influencing Dunk. The Castle Wall through weirnet  somehow. Maybe because he is Hodor's grandgrandfather or something.
**"He knew every stone of that wall".** 




 I feel what you write could be true, but not relevant to the story.

It could just as easy be an homage to Tokiens's "The Undying Lands" which lies west of Middle Earth. 




 Em-Com would even be right :) 




 Regrettably no.. I needed to fly past Ike for a science contract and this came up. It was easily corrected but I felt like sharing it because it looks kind of hilarious. 









 You have to read up on the **R+L=J** "theory". There are so much foreshadowing for that theory it is generally regarded as a known fact. 




 HBO makes Dunk and Egg mini series with 3 episodes 




 Robert was the heir to his house, Baratheons are known to be proud. Ned was a second son of the quiet house Stark. 




 Wow Thanks guys, exactly what I'm looking for!
 




 I must first say. I suck at building spaceplanes. I have watched Scott Manley building but it is really hard.

I bit into Career into beta, ship costs are really expensiv. So a cheap reusable ship to carry loads for stations and such would be really handy.

I wonder if anyone here have a good build with stock parts for a shuttle taking of vertically or horizontally with high cargo capability or wants to create one for this purpose would be a Kerbal King.

If it looks like one of Nasa's Shuttles. Bonus points! 




 Volantis is close to Valyria. Well relatively.
They have a lot of experience about the waters thereabouts and know any ship going to Valyria won't return. They knew Tommen II was going to die in Valyria, so they followed him and stole all he had and killed them?

Why not! :D 




 Ordered the book 1-4 moments after seeing episode 10 of season 1. so I knew everything there. 
When I had read aFfC I was depressed, but happily realized book 5 had just been released!  




 Oh my. Are we having **another** rebellion? You must be kidding me. 




 As an honourable man of the North he felt he could be useful at the Wall. You must remember The North look at serving in the Watch as a great deed. Jorah could handle Bear Island (well).. 




 Yes, and that's what she would say should she be in the next season.

http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0265610/

Her schedule is pretty empty, she might appear.
I won't be surprised if they cut her though. 




 Yeah. screw Brienne right? 




 His blog is down? tWoW release for christmas 2014 confirmed ! 




 ** can see why people downvote you to hell...** Should actors have been contacted a script would be done. Then we would have producers already working on it and somewhere along the way it would have leaked.

You will be considered a troll making such statements without a source. And don't say it's because you can't say anything else. This is the internet, not the streets of North Korea. 




 I too have vague memory of HBO owning all rights... :( 




 I think you may be right. Bloodraven is in them though, and Maester Aemon could easily be made fit to make a cameo in the beginning to gather interest. **And I think with the proper title and a "pilot" with many references to characters and events we heard of**, HBO could make people interested in Dunk   Egg. 

**Any suggestions**?

"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms" is actually pretty good.

"A True Knight of Westeros" would be more eyecatching. 




 Sweet summer child. GRRM had the whole story fleshed out in 1995..
It has nothing to do with that. It is the dialogues, the foreshadowing and the subtle hints in every other paragraph that makes these book take so fucking long a time to write. That and the 1500 pages of manuscript each one consist of... 




 Agree on Robert's rebellion.

However I don't feel Dunk and Egg is quite epic enough to make it to the big screen. It's still good drama though with a good climax in each story. As I mentioned in the OP, BBC's Sherlock has a quite fitting way of doing it. With 3 episodes per year each 1 and a half hour in length. 

It could be awesome considering each novella is a separate story still connected to the other two. 




 I am so glad you shared this life changing revelation! It invites to a lengthy discussion indeed!  




 Well. I don't know how to answer that without offending you. 




 Good point. We would get to see how Rhaegar fought nobly and get to know the Targaryen family first hand before diving in to the great history. 




 I would like to see the conquest, dance of dragons and blackfyre rebellions made with the budgets they deserve. Because even though the series-format makes for a dramaturgically better story I can't help to believe the lower budgets that comes with it would basically massacre some of the grander events visually.  









 Barely nothing word by word. But he wrote the whole Targaryen history, too long to be in the book. Elio and Linda shortened it down. Georges version will be published later as a complete history of the Targaryens. 




 Foreshadowing for revenge of some sort I would say! Bran will remember the whole history of Westeros and most likely the whole world, so I doubt I is in regards to that.  




 Wasn't it steel that came with the Andals? 
I feel the first men came with bronze as their main metal, but had discovered iron by the time of the long night, what 4000 years later? 

And the others aren't vulnerable to iron. They just hate it as it is an object crafted by man. 
At least that is how I perceive it.  




 He replied to a comment on his blog once. That's it and I don't see why it's a big deal. 




 You sweet summer child. You know nothing of fear. 




 E-LL-I-O-T? 




 They said it to boost sales. Really lame.
He wrote it 10 years prior to ASOIAF. it can't be set in westeros, because 1981 Westeros didn't exist. 




 I really think Alfie Allen has portrayed Reek so extremely good. He was an ok Theon. But he really is Reek.

I just want him reeling about and rhyme a lot on his name next season and I will be fully satisfied. 




 I consider it an "in-universe history". Most historical things are correct, but description of events crucial for ASOIAF are false or missing.

I got it for christmas (waiting was really hard). And I have read some small portions about the Dawn age and some of the Targ kings. And I must say, though it is exceptionally interesting. The Art is really what blew my mind. Dunk vs The Laughing Storm made my jaw drop. 

**I really (really) hope HBO makes Dunk and Egg into a series. Maybe like Sherlock, with 3 episodes each year about 1 and a half hour in length."**
That would make 3 seasons. 
HBO should prepare for such a series in the Show with Bran somehow. Just hinting at it with something to make the stories intertwine a bit. 




 same here..
