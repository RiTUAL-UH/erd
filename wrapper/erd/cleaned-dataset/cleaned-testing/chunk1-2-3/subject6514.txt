 Living right up to that username 




 "Oh, you said it, friend - but I wanted to stay 'cause I almost had sex on this girl. 
Oh yeah, but it was so expensive, each drink was like 6 dollars 40." 




 Nothing cringe here. They strive to ace the test and finish first and they did. We'll done for learning what you've been taught!

The change in him happened as fast as an electrical pulse. At that moment, he was no longer Phil; he had become what the world now knows as Insanity Wolf! 




 Some say he's a mystery wrapped in an enigma 




 Nice to meet you, elevatormech :)
