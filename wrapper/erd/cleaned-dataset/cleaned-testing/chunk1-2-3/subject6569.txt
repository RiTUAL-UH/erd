 I would recommend that links to the actual leaks here not be included. Discussion is what is really desired (at least for me), but the links allow them grounds to delete the links in their subs to this one. Anyone can do a google search and find them quite easily without too much instruction.

I agree 100%. 




 The response I posted in the other thread:

I do understand the sentiment even though I suspect it's a bit hypocritical. I doubt that out of all of the mods over at /r/gameofthrones, none has watched the leaked episodes... Well, it's a moot point.


I guess there's just one thing to do:**Whenever you see anyone over in /r/gameofthrones (or any other sub) ask about a place to discuss the leaked episodes, send them a PM to inform them of this subreddit.**


That way only people *overtly* looking for a discussion are told of this place and the mods over at /r/gameofthrones can rest assured that this sub is only "advertised" to people who want to take part in the discussion.

 Yeah, me too... 




 Do that. 

I understand and respect their decision to not allow any discussion of the leaked episodes on /r/gameofthrones but at the same I would like them to acknowledge that people *will* watch them and *will* want to discuss them afterwards, to pretend anything else would be naive. 

Why not give viewers a sub where they can do just that? It would drastically cut down on spoilers in /r/gameofthrones and it would give subscribers a clear decision: Want to watch the leaked episodes and discuss them afterwards? Head over to /r/piratesofthrones. Want to watch the episodes as they air and remain spoiler-free? Stay in /r/gameofthrones! 




 By the same logic they could ban ASOIAF wikis. I don't think they should have to keep their subscribers safe from spoilers *outside of their own sub*... 




 Some one mentioned /r/piratesofthrones in a comment in the "Episode leaks, Spoilers and Piracy" sticky thread.

I responded to them with this:

I wouldn't be surprised if your post were deleted - it's what happened to the only other post I saw mentioning another such subreddit.
I would be interested in the mods' reasoning behind this. I understand and support their decision to keep /r/gameofthrones as spoiler-free as possible but it seems like sending people to another sub for the discussion of the leaked episodes could only help that goal!

A couple of minutes later both our posts had been deleted. No explanation by the mods. The only explanation I can come up with is that the mod team doesn't want people to fuck off to other subs but that would be incredibly petty...

Thoughts? 




 Right you are. Thanks for refreshing my memory! 




 It's been so very long since I read the books so I'd appreciate it if someone could refresh my memory:

Is that how Mance dies in the books? This scene seemed very unfamiliar to me. Also, it seems like they completely changed Tyrion's story line or am I remembering that wrong? Was Varys with him in the books?

 I agree - sex is an important aspect of a romantic relationship and you're not helping anyone by staying in a relationship with someone who won't/can't fulfill you sexually.  




 Good idea, a separate subreddit will help keep /r/GameOfThrones as spoiler-free as possible!

Upvoted for visibility. 




 Serious question:

I understand that the uploader blurred the watermark but wouldn't HBO alter something (e.g. a tiny blip in a random frame) unique to each screener so that if it leaks they could find the guilty party? 
























 Something along the lines of "Well, you're sitting here, matching each of my replies with one of your one so who's the shitdick living in mum's trailer?"

Hence my comment. 




 By the logic you just invoked... both of you? 




 Well ain't you just the cutest little thing?

**EDIT:**
Aww, don't you wanna play anymore? It was just getting fun!

Well, goodbye /u/mrjewels and best of luck with med school! 




 Oh. I, too, will get older. Eventually I'll die.

I just got that.  




 How so? 

Human interest news has nothing to do with Buzzfeed in itself, it's simply a basic staple of journalism. You might as well say that newspapers are the buzzfeed for people over 40...  




 You can answer a call. 

You can answer the door.

You can answer to your name.

You can answer to a description.

I'm sure there are more options but after thinking about the word for so long it has lost all meaning and is just a weird jumble of letters and sounds, A phenomenon which, by the way, is called [semantic satiation.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation)

 




 So, wait, you *didn't* buy it?! 




 I... what? 




 It's an opinion piece from the National Review and it's terribly inaccurate. What this piece of drivel is doing in /r/nottheonion I'll never understand... 




 We're here. That was quick. 




 I felt like Veep got over that phase after season 1. Regardless, I think the Veep people are the best ensemble cast currently on TV, maybe the best since season 3 of Arrested Development.

The way they play off of each other is unmatched by anything on TV right now! 




 Wow, talk about petty... 




 Anyone else pleasantly surprised that Daenerys actually listened to Barristan Selmy? 
























 Yeah, but the show has already deviated from the books (and I expect this to get even more pronounced as Season 5 develops). Ain't no going back now.  




  the therapist would have to report you to authorities

If that's true then it's terrifying - and infuriating, because such a law would keep many pedophiles from seeking help, thus directly endangering children! 




 I agree. I don't believe that he can be faulted for having such desires (after all, you don't get to choose your sexuality) but his unwillingness to seek help for it is a red flag for me. If you have pedophilic tendencies you represent a danger to other people, no matter how well you think you have it "under control".   




 Well ain't you just a ray of ~~thinly veiled rage issues~~ sunshine.  




 Speaking as a European (from a country that is basically being worshipped by U.S. pro-gun people, mostly for inaccurate reasons) if limited magazine size is your biggest gripe with a candidate for the presidency you oughta be jumping for joy... 




 I just downloaded his thesis and flipped through it, curious about the writing style. The first thing I noticed? The dedication:

In the hopes that this work may in some way contribute
to their exploration of space, this is dedicated to the crew
members of this country' s present and future manned space
programs. If only I could join them in their exciting endeavors.


Made my day!

 




 Where did she say that?

She was talking about 23 year old men who *pursue sexual relationships with underage girls*, not all 23 year old men. That's a pretty big difference! 




 You can resign from the council. Voila! 




 What's safe or unsafe about any of us? Are you asking because you think that white men *specifically* are less 'unsafe' than other groups of the population or because you don't understand / disagree with the concept of a safe space?

I'll give you an example: Twice a month me and a whole bunch of my male friends get together for an evening - no women allowed. Activities differ - we might go for a hike or play some b-ball or go see a movie or have ourselves a good, old-fashioned N64 multiplayer-party. Usually there's copious amounts of drinking involved as well. We always have a great time.

And always, at some point in the evening, we start talking for real. Discussions that we can't have (or can't have in that way) with our girlfriends (and in the case of two of my mates, boyfriends). We talk about issues in our relationships, our careers, our physical and mental health and we all get a lot out of these talks. Because sometimes it's just nice to get some feedback on your issues from people who have similar experiences without having your partners involved.

That's an example of a safe space. Don't you see the value in that?  




 Yeah, I gotta agree. 

Hey i made as many as of you hosts so please invite loads of BME women and non-binary people!!

Also if you've been invited and you're a man and/or white PLEASE DON'T COME just cos I invited a bunch of people and hope you will be responsible enough to respect this is a BME Women and non-binary event only... Don't worry lads we will give you and allies things to do ;-)

I think that post is silly but I also think the word "ban" is hyperbole. Safe spaces can be useful tools - just think of women's or men's shelters, support groups for addictions or illnesses(Damn you Marla Singer)).  




 I remember reading research about incidences of anorexia suddenly sky-rocketing in developing countries when their TV stations started broadcasting western programming (I want to say sitcoms but I'm not sure) for the first time that depicted thinness as an attractive trait. If you're interested I can try and find it as soon as I'm not on mobile anymore.

In general I think that people who don't believe that we're influenced by the media are the same sort of people who claim that "ads don't work" on them...
