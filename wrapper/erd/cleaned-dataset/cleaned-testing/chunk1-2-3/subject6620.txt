 Best looking vehicle with a Subaru badge on it. I've got to go back to [this] (http://www.motorstown.com/imgs/18020-subaru-svx-2.html) in order to recall any other Subaru as visually stunning.  




 You should drop Mendenhall. There has got to be another way to fill that roster spot with someone that doesn't register 0 each week. Time to start scoring some points, man. 




 Being that you're in Chicago after all [unlawful intent can be presumed] (http://thefiringline.com/library/blades/knifelaws.html) 




 Not the most exciting roster spot to add, but consider the Cardinals D/ST. They shut down Vick and the Eagles weapons last week, and are going up against a struggling Miami offense. 




 Livable wages   fair medical benefits would be the first of a number of reasons. Unionized commercial food workers can make around $16-17 per hour for the jobs that Walmart workers get paid $9-10 an hour for.  




 The ice rink at Millennium Park would be a great option in late November. Zoo Lights in Lincoln Park = free. Ride the Ferris Wheel if the two of you aren't afraid to shiver a little.   




 Perhaps the Gangster Disciples near Division   Pulaski should consider moving to a more friendly community. So many of their neighbors are of the insane/maniacal variety. 




 Any game that the Hogs play against the Wolves will either be televised on Comcast or MY50 for Chicago locals. The way AHL's scheduling is structured that's probably 8-10 games this season 




 Sometimes stickers come in cow shapes and chicken shapes too. That's protein for ya!
 




 Perhaps Cutler could be more of a said bitch if he went to play for the Wings and remained a mediocre defenseman on their squad until he is 67 years old. 




 This has got to be one of the lesser liked Illinois or Cook County cops. They gave him a 2004 Malibu!

 I find it more offensive that the Canucks are #3. First, their logo can simply be classified as stupid. Additionally, the huge VANCOUVER letters are obnoxious. Lastly, they borrowed the color scheme from the 1990s Seahawks. #3? Seriously? 




 For most of the mid 90s until about 2006 these jerseys were about the only thing the Hawks had going for them.  




 What did the 911 call sound like?
 




 It's a bit crazy. I've thought about proposing some trades for depth. Trading away the guys that you drafted early makes no sense though. Why pick a RB/WR1 and not show the confidence to keep him on your roster? 




 Looked at the title too fast and thought "He bought steak at Giordano's!?" ...but hopefully this helps the owners get it together.  




 Guy is alone because of the Detroit Vipers jersey.

 Saddest moment in Berwyn history: http://chicagoist.com/2008/05/03/berwyn_spindle_1.php 




 Gone are the days when the Wolves were the only independent club in the IHL; I miss that. It's partly said "business" and partly the growing emphasis on the AHL being a developmental league. It seems that the number of veterans a club is allowed keeps shrinking. 

But with an impending lockout there is a great deal to be excited about this October! The roster will be stacked, and Wendell has brought Haydar and Sterling back together too.    




 I second this. The wolves are more of their own entity than most AHL teams. 

As far as the Ice Hogs go... thanks for Andrew Shaw. Nothing else positive to say about that organization. 




 Terrible luck!
 
If you go to Velasquez   Sons they can replace a catalytic converter way cheaper than most. It was 2006, but I got one for $90 parts and labor.  




 Even funnier is the ad box on the tribune's page: 

"Single? Meet local older women for free!"
 




 AHL gets no coverage in the states either. Chicago Wolves are the only team that televises all of their games, and it's local coverage only.  




 Way too much credit being given to Americans with this. This is assuming that they know of at least 10 countries in this region and can identify their shapes. 




 AHL during the last lockout was damn good. Guys like Vanek   Cammelleri ,that normally would have made NHL squads, played and tore things up. I remember watching my Wolves get destroyed in the finals by a team that featured Patrick Sharp, Jeff Carter, Mike Richards, Umberger, Nittamayki, and more.  




 Since it is a 2-way deal they should be able to. 

The circumstances were different in 2004-2005, but young NHL players like E.Staal and Spezza went down to the AHL after playing full seasons in the NHL. 




 Not over Sproles. Even though Sproles may get less than 10 carries, he has the potential to grab ~8 passes and rack up big yardage. Gerhart my get the same amount of touches, but his ceiling isn't nearly as high.  




 For a 10 team league this is terrible depth at RB.  




 Satisfyingly evil-looking.  




 Is it? Shouldn't it be "woman's best friend." Not "women's"
Nobody is saying "men's best friend." 




 So I'll refine my question and eliminate the loaded term "genocide." 

What is the proper historical legacy of Japanese war crimes (and crimes against humanity) that included: mass killings, human experimentation, biological warfare, and undeniable torture during the time period I mentioned?

How can we diminish the importance the potential lowest point humankind has ever reached. The actions of Japan during the 1930's and 1940's brought about what is perhaps the most widespread suffering the world has known.

 Wish I had been alive--or they would bring back--the NASL. Hockey fans would love it. MLS just is not that exciting. The NASL was able to lure big names like Pele and superstars from Europe. Plus they had probably the most intense post-regulation elimination shootouts.

 Or... keep it; instead of a 2 min penalty being assessed to the goalie, he becomes a skater who is allowed to handle the puck. However, being that he is outside the trapezoid/ goalie zone, the rules should allow for him to be bodychecked within the rules of checking any other puck-handling skater. I know my grandpa would love to see this, he suggests this every time he sees the damn trapezoid on tv.

 I guess you need to look at economic/social trends in Eastern Europe. I live in an area with a high population of new immigrants from Poland. BMWs, iphones, and flashy clothing is very ubiquitous among this group. (much different from my Polish relatives who came here ~100 years ago, who primarily came in a wave of lesser-skilled labor)

A number of the 21st Century immigrants are probably coming here for work because of their technical or specialized knowledge.

 I've been used to working 55 hrs a week for a while now. Draining work for sure, but I've got to imagine it's only about 4 months. 




 Thanks! This sounds a lot like what the job climate/ lifestyle is like for my uncle. I am definitely going to seek out his point of view as well. 




 Not incredibly random. I have a family member who is successful in the field, and have seen some of my college classmates transition into the professional field fairly soon after graduation.

It really takes a special kind of person to become an MD, and it really only pays more in the long run, considering that 4yrs of medical school + being an intern + the cost of school-related debt and malpractice insurance etc., etc., ...I cannot imagine that most MDs are making good money until they are past 30.  




 As is the case with many of us who are fresh graduates. Does an internship necessarily mean that you work for months in the field w/o getting paid? Already did an "internship" while student teaching, where I pretty much took over a classroom for 4 months, having to work nights and weekends w/o my university or cooperating school district knowing. Hoping not to get stuck in that situation at this point in my life.  




 Here is my situation: 24 y/o BA in Secondary Education; BA in History.

After two unsuccessful summers of not landing a full-time position as a history teacher, I am planning to do something more practical in place of the subject that I feel passionate about. The economic incentives of being a substitute teacher or a private school teacher are non-existent. I make more in my current position at a reading clinic/ my union weekend job.

From a purely practical/economic perspective, does it make sense for me to jump into a Masters of Science in Accounting program? 

It seems that the opportunities are more bountiful in this field, and if I strike out at landing a teaching job next year I'm probably going to give up anyway. Assuming that I can complete CPA certification, I probably can use a family connection to help me land a position in the accounting field. Just wanted to know if there is anything beneath the surface that would make it equally difficult for me in this field.

Thanks!

 Great start for Eddie Lack. This is his year to show that he has what it takes to play in the NHL. Anything less than an all-star nomination will be a disappointment.

 Pick up Richardson if possible. He fell an eyelash short of 100 yds yesterday and had just 13 touches (11 rushes, 2 catches). Plus, the Rams are probably going to part ways w/ SJax at the end of the year, so they will probably give him a good deal of work in the near future to see what he can do.

 **[ENTRY]** [Pontiac Fiero GT] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FIEROi2.jpg) Why? An American mid-engine two-seater from a defunct manufacturer that is made almost entirely of plastic and has a weird cargo section near the engine, no bonnet (hood), and still has a cult following. 

Get Clarkson in one of these, would love to see his reactions to it.  




 [This video] (http://www.empireofsoccer.com/flashback-vid-the-nasl-shootout-new-york-cosmos-v-washington-diplomats/) shows the intensity and suspense that were present in NASL shootouts. The league really had a few glory moments. Pele came to the New York Cosmos, and for a while fans were thrilled and passionate. 

I watched the movie "Once in a Lifetime" the story of the New York Cosmos, and it seemed like the league could have created a whole new soccer experience for Americans.

I wasn't alive to experience the NASL, so my question for those who were is this: Why did it fizzle out? 
 




 Soccer is and has always been my favorite sport, but I honestly hate matches that end in a draw. [The NASL concept] (http://www.empireofsoccer.com/flashback-vid-the-nasl-shootout-new-york-cosmos-v-washington-diplomats/) to end matches had to have been such a suspenseful and awesome experience for fans though. I just wish that this concept would have caught on on a bigger scale, because no true soccer fan likes watching matches decided on penalty kicks. 




 The tie is a dead concept in the NHL with the dawn of the shootout. 




 This kid was quite the sniper for the Rampage a few years back. Such an abrupt and unfortunate ending.

 Wayne. He's red hot and getting a plethora of targets. NYJ are not playing good defense at all.

 Hell yes. A truly International Hockey League? The old IHL (RIP 1945-2001) only had one team, Soviet Wings, outside of N.A. for just one season.   

This would open up so many opportunities to see different styles of play   really good players who never fit into the North American style of play.

 Considering that most of this car is made of plastic, and that V8 is sitting right in the middle of it, you've got a very quick little ride there. 

I cannot look at this too long though, it's making me sad. Why it had to end for Pontiac while soulless Buick keeps on living is a reality I do not want to accept. 




 Consider the Mazda 3. Consumer Report is saying that it is a great buy. The new "Skyactiv" engine gets the best fuel economy in its class and is actually more fuel-efficient than Mazda's subcompact Mazda 2. Additionally, the long-term costs are projected to be low considering the trends of the Mazda 3's build quality and reliability over the past few years. The price is not that much different than the Cruze or Focus either.

I wish i was in the market for one today. 
























 That block on the Forte run was responsible for 6 points as well, don't forget that!

 He WAS the reason why the Bears went 13-3 back in 2001. I remember more than one game-changing interception return from Brown during this season. Talk about a guy that brought such intensity every week, going all-out is why he had so many injuries, and when he would get injured you could see how much it frustrated him to be on the sidelines. We miss you, Mike Brown. '

Edit: Confirmed info: Brown had two walk-off interception returns for TDs during the 2001 season.

  Picking Charles at #7... I'm happy to say that I was able to do the same, shocking as it may be. 




 If I remember correctly, there was a model called the VL that was lower. It had a 2.0L instead of the 2.2L in the RS. Also, it was missing those badass white wheels, and Rally Sport trim. 




 1991 Chevy [Cavalier RS](http://carphotos.cardomain.com/ride_images/1/3093/1221/7730610002_large.jpg) Owned this car in high school/freshman year of college, and actually drove it from 2005 to 2007; which is shocking, because today it is one of the most egregious vehicles that I have ever seen let alone owned. 

The car was sort-of white and featured electric blue and black trim along each bumper and exterior door panel. Giant electric blue and black letters saying "CAVALIER RS" bedecked the driver doors. The Rally Sport edition that also had painted-white metal wheels. Mine was literally falling apart. Any parking lot where I closed my door was sprinkled with rusty dust. 

Then, literally everything on the car broke. Someone slammed into the driver's door in high school, so that didn't open. The power locks broke, so I was forced to climb through the trunk should I decide to lock the doors that actually worked. No A/C. No Heat. I came out of class one day to notice that the exhaust system had literally snapped in half, and  I dragged the pipe down the street going a top speed of 30mph with my gas pedal to the floor. 

The good news? I sold it for $100 in '07.

TLDR: The 1991 Cavalier RS is an incredibly shitty automobile.  




 But... these shirts were on clearance. 




 So, this is in Mexico? 




 It's a fantastic looking car. However, keep looking for someone willing to fall in love with it if you want top dollar. Despite the car being out of production, there seem to be plenty of them in the used market; I don't think you will get a ton of calls if you're pricing it over $20,000.

 [Here are a couple options through DC social sports.](http://dcsocialsports.com/leagues/soccer?state=LIVE locationId=) The co-ed league is more at the recreational level. (Although the teams I have played for had some really great females on them). The men's league is much more competitive. We play at the Long Bridge Park soccer fields, they are synthetic turf, and lighted for night games. Plus, the league usually has a bar component where everyone goes out and drinks post-game. 




 Will do; thanks for the resource! 




 I have been offered a position to teach middle school social studies in DC. After just speaking with my principal in passing, she said that she would like to sit down with me and discuss the "scope and sequence" for the 7th   8th Grade social studies curriculum next year. From my research, I'm picturing that this is a long term, big-picture framework for district wide lesson planning. However, she mentioned that she was not satisfied with the last social studies teacher's "scope and sequence." Which makes me believe that I may have to do some collaborating with her to make the overall, big-picture framework. 

Of course, when I sit down with her I would like to appear like I know what I'm talking about. So, if those of you out there in r/historyteachers-land could give me some information on what I can expect to talk to her about I'd greatly appreciate it! I have seemed very confident in my interactions with her thusfar, but she is a bit intimidating (Columbia Teachers' College grad, and also a big history nerd). Just trying to avoid being sent to the social studies teachers' graveyard like the last guy. 

[This is the only example I was able to locate online](http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/Files/downloads/In-the-Classroom/How-Students-Are-Assessed/Grade%207%20ELA%20SAS%20SY13-14.pdf)    

Thanks!  




 Also, that Focus is very fun to drive. I had to drive a friend of mine home once in a Focus hatch from this era, and I was very impressed with its pickup and handling. Probably had all the same features as yours, but she had hers shipped here from the Netherlands, so it gave it an extra cool factor. One of the most fun cars I've driven for sure. 




 It is a rare rear-wheel drive beast. However, this guy had [the last of the Grand Prix GXPs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pontiac_Grand_Prix_GXP_.jpg) 




 Just found this! [It's never too late, man](http://www.recycler.com/details/24681296) 




 Not necessarily stupid though, more of a sad trade-off. The area I moved to last winter made driving my Pontiac far too laborious. I got a "smarter" car that saves me money on both fuel and VA requirements. However, it lacks the special feel of driving the Pontiac. 

I was going through a quarter tank of gas every day working in DC, and then I find out that Northern VA has a 24-point inspection for road safety. (My driver's door didn't shut properly   power windows didn't work among some other issues with the power steering) All in all, I sold it in MD for $4000 in exchange for a friendlier DC driver (the Elantra). 

In summary, we aren't making "stupid" decisions, just dealing with the reality of the increasingly Pontiac-less motoring world of today.  




 your rant is completely justified. I can't even tell you how many people had the same criticism of GM about the frankly dumbass choice of preserving Buick. The consumers need to let their voice be heard. Time to put the soulless division of Buick to sleep and resurrect the excitement that was Pontiac!!!!!!
 




 I feel you. I had a Grand Am GT Coupe that I bought when I was 19, and I just let it go this past February. Let's not credit Pontiac for making the best quality cars; but Pontiacs did inspire a certain feeling for those who owned them. It was certainly a car that I was excited to drive.  




 let's hope. Front end looks majorly improved. 




 $33, not too big of a deal  




 Well put. Although, I wish all my neighbors their just reward for not being a great resident of Alexandria like myself.  




 Yeah. Plus, it isn't very much anyway. I've paid 3 times as much for "city-stickers" before. Guess I should have made the association that city-sticker=a source to generate revenue for the local gov't (aka TAX). Initially, I was taken aback back by the term "vehicle property tax."
 




 I've been in Alexandria for about six months now, but after buying a car in FL, and then switching over to VA license and registration I have paid the "vehicle property tax" and posted the sticker on my car as proof. 

Here's the thing, less than half the cars in my neighborhood have City of Alexandria stickers on them. I'm noticing that a number of the ones that do have stickers also have out-of-date ones. Is the vehicle property tax just something that isn't really enforced in AVA? And am I a sucker for even paying it?

 Unfortunately, I didn't get to experience the concept of the "two hour delays" that can happen here in the schools that I work in. (I would assume more snowfall needed.) The reactions are certainly different than the midwest; I remember having to walk to high school with 16 inches of snow on the ground in Chicago. I think my school had one snow day every 40 years. 




 Just moved here 1 month ago from Chicago. The top two things I miss are: 
1. The Blackhawks
2. Being able to order Giardiniera on things

I'm not about to jump on board with the Caps, though. I think we'll be lucky to see 5-6 Hawks games on local tv in DC this year. Such a shame, because this team is going to tear it up this year. 




 Got to love that car. Is that a Ford Aspire, Donovan?
 




 Raffi Torres for sure. 




 What about the [Dodge Daytona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Daytonashelbyz.jpg)? It looks like it was built on the same platform as the Starion; much like the Mitsubishi Mirage was to the Dodge Colt. 
 




 Hondas and Toyotas have the best reputation for reliability; however, in your price range you can expect six-digit odometer numbers. I think that you may be able to find an Elantra with 60-70K miles on it.   




 Yep. Darryl Drake. 




 So what's up with Shaw then, just 1 goal on the season so far?  




 Thank you. From what I read in a guide to teacher certification reciprocity, it seemed that 3 years experience was almost a requirement to have my certificate recognized in MD.  




 Thanks! This is very helpful, I haven't really sought out the charter school opportunities in Chicago too enthusiastically, but I'm probably better equipped to take on those challenges now than I was a year ago. I'll definitely investigate. Any insight that your wife could provide would be greatly appreciated.

 Please tell me what is the job market for teachers like in the metropolitan area? 

I am moving here next month from Chicago as part of a project that my current employer is doing. However, I'm a certified teacher and haven't gotten a classroom in IL due to an insane disparity between many applicants and very few openings. (not to mention widespread district cutbacks, etc.) I'd love to teach in DC or northern VA. 

So redditor-educators of DC, what type of climate should I expect? Are there any districts that you know of that I should target? Do you know of any paraprofessional/teaching-aide positions that may be opening up in the near future? I'd love to get my foot in the door, and would be open to ditching my employer to make a positive step in obtaining my goal of teaching in the classroom. 

Any suggestions or advice would be much appreciated.

Thanks!!   




 That has got to be Wal-Mart. 




 Soccer fans are ok with it, because the result is 45 minutes of continuous play uninterrupted by commercials.
