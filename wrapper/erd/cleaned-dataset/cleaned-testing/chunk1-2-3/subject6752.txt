 I have lived there a year and paid a lot of late fees because my job keeps witholding and fucking with my pay. I couldn't save at all because I was paying sometimes 40 a month extra in late fees because of my job. I have also recieved three 10 day eviction notices. The first was for being 10 days late, the second for seven, the third for 2. I had never missed a payment, only paid late. My landlord recently broke my car window and has done nothing toward paying for it. I only have until 10/15 left in the lease and last rent is due 9/15. The entire length of my tenancy the management company has been shady and rude and I don't believe I will see a dime of ny security despite making no damage. I am not worried about future tenancy as I will be living with my parents for some time from then on and can use them to get a new apartment down the road if need be. 

What will happen if I don't pay? 


































 I'm new here and don't know a whole lot. My girlfriend recently took up MK and I like a lot of the products, but are they actually good for skin? I like microdermabrasion and botanical effects. 




 What do you guys like and dislike? Our anniversary is coming up, and my girlfriend and I want some new toys. We have been looking at RodeoH for me and Velvetnest for her. Anyone know anything about them or any other preferences? 









 We have been together just shy of four years. She has PCOS and has yet to find a perfect birth control to treat it. The current one has her extremely nasty and she claims depressed but I don't know. 

Last night, I got stuck late at work and therefore late to pick her up. She knows I am working on getting a raise. She called my mother and they each called me several times trying to find me. The exact situation happened a week ago. I told her that she is mauling me and she got pissed at me for worrying her.

She will not get her driver's license, leaving me responsible for transportation of both of us.

My mom is disabled and doesn't socialize much except with me and my girlfriend. My girlfriend often ignores her in favor of reading books despite the fact that my mom has bent over backwards for her. (Buying work uniforms, letting her move in at 17, etc).

I wake up early in the morning for work and she works second shift. I spend free time with my mom as I only get one and her poor health means I need to treasure the time I get. She always complains about being tired and wanting to go home when she gets far more sleep than I. 

We used to be very sexual. We would have sex twice a day everyday the whole first summer we were dating. We haven't had sex in a month. I ask and get either maybe or we'll see or I'm tired. I hate being rejected. Mostly I hate when she spends the day trying to grope me and make out with me AT MY MOMS HOUSE and then sleeps when we get home.

We are going away in October for our 4th anniversary. I took a day and a half off work for it already. She has yet to request it. I don't even know if I want to go. We were going to announce our engagement after this trip. I don't know if I want to promise another week never mind the rest of my life.

She promised we wouldn't go to her abusive father's wedding. (He abused us both when we lived with him briefly.) Then she told them we would. Now we aren't because it's the weekend before our anniversary and she can't get two weekends in a row off. She still hasn't told him she isn't going to attend. 

I really do love this girl. We have been together since high school. I just don't know where to go from here.

TL;DR girlfriend is being unusually psycho and I don't want to stay but I don't want to leave either. 
























 Theu played hockey with the poor little guy amd cleaned him thoroughly. He was fine. Theu were ashamed. It was very adorable in the end after a horrifying beginning. 









 My Moxie, who is probably around 2, has had labored breathing and been barely moving since at least 8 this morning. She is hanging on and her cage mate Roxie keeps checking on her. I have accepted that she is likely dying, but is there something I can do to help her? 









 One who saves you personally. 














 On /r/parenting, people talk about cosleeping in a positive way. We know cosleeping is dangerous. Babies get rolled on, and babies roll or fall of beds. Having a baby in bed also destroys intimacy in the parents' relationship. It is hard to get a kid to stay out of your bed anyway. If you let them for a long time then stop them, it'll be thay much harder later, further destroying intimacy. Basinets are not a huge inconvenience. Keep it by your bed to make feeding easy. They are small enough that they fit nearly anywhere. There are also basinets that get attached to the bed. Cosleeping should always be discouraged and absolutely never encouraged. CMV. 














 On October 10th we will be together for four years. Their wedding is October 4th. 

They got married already and are now having a big wedding. They waited two months before accidentally telling my partner that they got married. 

They have out right stated that they dislike me and that our relationship is invalid. We aren't sure if it is because I am female or if it is personal.

It is a semi themed wedding. My partner is to dress for the theme while I am not.

Despite the fact that we have been together two years longer than them, our invitation was addressed to my partner and guest. They know my name.

Are we being petty or is this just icing on the rude cake that is her parents?

**tl;dr**: Father in laws. Girlfriend wouldn't exist without him, and he won't go away.  
























 You guys are really turned on by WBC. 









 I am overweight, hefty, whatever you prefer. I got an exercise trampoline to help change that. After having been swimming a lot lately and generally eating better, I decided to jump on it today, not for the first time. I jumped twice and metal flew from the side and scared the hell out of my cats. 

TL DR too fat to work out, not fat enough to be confined to a bed.

Edit: Thank you all so much for being encouraging! I start my next semester of college on August 25th and since we have a new campus, I get access to a great gym facility that I plan to use. I'm going to keep at it and maybe be able to show you guys some before and after in a few months.  



















 Half a case of Lager in my fridge and I can't stand the taste. 














 Ask whatever. 




 I work for an agency to transport a developmentally delayed man to and from work and to take him to activities. Currently, my car is unsafe due to the lack of these parts. My brother and father are willing to install the parts, I just can't afford them right now. I am on food stamps and extremely hard up. If you can find the parts for the car (1999 Plymouth Neon) cheaper and wish to send me those, feel free. Anything at all helps. PM for shipping info if interested.

 It is up to mod discretion and I have been deleted in AskWomen because the mod fucking DISAGREED with me. I'm sorry but if you can't handle reading words on the internet you need to be in a bubble. It is total bullshit that people are so offended by words that they are deleted. It just gives the words more power. Grow the fuck up. And un fucking subscribe to AskWomen and their asshole mods. 



















 A few bad apples can spoil the whole bunch. The reason for not wanting them to be there in the first place is people who choose to expose their non female genitals in what is supposed to be a female space. Take Mich Fest for example. Many women there are victims of violent sexual assault. They are choosing to be in a space they feel is safer. As a women only space they should not have to worry about seeing male genitals. Pre op stealth women would not want to be outed and so would be extremely unlikely to even accidentally expose themselves. Post op transwomen have no.male genitals to show. In order to keep people more comfortable, a female space should be just that. People who are male do not belong their if they risk hurting female women even emotionally. 

Disclaimer: I am not debating whether or not trans women are women. They without a doubt are regardless of stage of transition. The issue is whether or not out transwomen who are pre op or non op belong in a space meant for females to feel safe. 

TL DR a penis free zone is a penis free zone. Cmv. 









 I am a transmasculine genderqueer lesbian. I am 19 and live in an apartment in the Poconos with my girlfriend of almost 4 years and our 11 pets. What would you guys be interested to see in a youtube vlogging channel from me? If you post specific questions, I will answer them in the video. 














 Hosted my brother's graduation party last night. My uncle in his 60s buys a case of lager to split between him, my other uncle, and my cousin. They only get through half so he leaves instructing my older brother to inform me that it's mine and to put it in the fridge. I don't like beer from my limited Rolling Rock experience and I don't have friends to drink with. 




 There is a reason you aren't legally allowed in Central Park after dark. If you choose to go in anyway and are raped/mugged/attacked/murdered, you knew the risk of going into the Park.

We all know that date rapes happen. If you leave your drink completely unattended and then choose to drink from it again, you are partially responsible as you are the one who chose to put something rather unknown into your body.

Bullies currently heavily target out gay kids. If you "pass" for straight and choose to be out in school, in part, you brought on the harassment. You knew the risks.

I know that breaking the law doesn't give others a right to harm you nor does making any other potentially poor choice, but if you know the risks and follow through anyway, you aren't totally innocent. 

TL;DR: choices have consequences. CMV. 





























 Has anyone done this before? I've never even been to the city. Any advice you could offer would be great. 









 I have been with my girlfriend and out as a lesbian for almost four years. A friend of ours invited us (well actually she told us we were going not asked) to a picnic with her family this weekend. We were happy to go until she informed me and my girlfriend we can "be out just don't hug or kiss or touch and don't act like you are dating". She askef my gf if she is okay wiyh it and my gf is a bit of pushover and was like oh yeah sure. However I am pissed. I went through a shit ton of crap for the right to be out. Like I had food thrown at me and was slammed into lockers and walls and just about pushed down the damn stairs. This girl knows all of this and yet she had basically told me to hide it. I cannot believe it. I have been nothing but supportive of her (she is a lesbian) and my girlfriend and I know how to behave. But for us to not be allowed to hold hands or anything is insulting. Now we are stuck going to this picnic and I don't know what to do. Am I overreacting? Should I still go?

TL DR: been out for 4 years. Friend wants my gf and me to hide us being a couple and gay for a picnic. Advice? 




 I work split shift for between five and eight hours Tuesday through Friday and tutor a kid when it fits with my work schedule. My partner works around 15 hours a week at a restaurant on weekends with extra shifts sprinkled in. Since the semester is over, we have a lot more free time. I desire to get things done. We need to be finding ways to make more money so we can get out of our really shitty financial situation (a near eviction, no car insurance, power over 1000 dollars late and due to be shut off, no food, etc.). I work from 8 to 830 every morning. She usually comes with me. Lately, she has been either staying in bed, or, like right now, going back to bed. She went to bed at about 1 this morning so it isn't like she should be exhausted. She knows I don't want to mess up my extremely sensitive sleep schedule. She insists I lay in bed next to her until she gets up at some point between 10 and 11. She gets mad at me if I go to the bathroom. I really love her and want to marry this girl. I just hate spending my days in bed not even asleep. I either read or go on reddit and facebook all morning.

TL;DR: Life ain't nothin but sleeping girls and no money. 

















































 In Cultural Anthropology just now, I was reading the AskReddit thread about kids' lies. I laughed, audibly, at one of the stories. Incidentally, I laughed just after my teacher was talking about slaves. Now my class thinks I find slavery funny. 







































 Can provide a spare bed in my living room. Lesbian couple, ages 19 and 20, pm me if needed. 




 There is a person in one of my classes that is a transwoman, however, at least in that class, she is not out. I know she is trans in part because of her presentation and in part because I was told such by a mutual friend when I asked. I only asked because she is very feminine and is referred to by other classmates with male pronouns. We have only interacted once and I avoided pronouns. What should I use? 




 If it pertains, I live in Monroe county.

My girlfriend and I have lived in our apartment for 5 months as of March 15th. In that time, we have been late with payment because of waiting on paychecks but have always paid the 5 dollars per day charge. 

I work as a companion to a man with Down Syndrome. He had been in the hospital, so I couldn't get papers signed, so I couldn't get paid. My pay will be in on April 5th. I will be getting about 700 dollars. Our rent is 675. I made a partial payment the day after the rent was due this month of 150 dollars. My girlfriend lost her job and got a new one and had been waiting on new pay checks to come. Today, March 25, we came home to a 10 day eviction notice. Our lease does state that habitual late payment can result in eviction. When we made the partial payment at the real estate agency the lease is through, we explained the scenario and asked to be notofoed if there would be an issue. No one notified us until now. Any and all advice is of help. 




 Edit: My girlfriend and I started datibg at fifteen and sixteen. Now that we are 19 and 20, seeing one is important. We both liked her's so I have an appointment with him next month. Just wondering if this was common. 




 Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but you girls always answer stuff well.

Back ground on us: I am 19, she will be 20 in early April. We have been together 3.5 years. 

Background on Dad: He has been married to 4 different women. He married my girlfriend's mom, divorced her after about two years, ran away to Vegas to marry wife number 2, then had a big Catholic wedding a year later. Divorced wife 2, married wife 3. Married wife number 2 AGAIN in a secret wedding, and is now having another big wedding to her.

Background on my girlfriend and her dad's relationship: he left when she was 2. He saw her maybe once a year until she was 16. Then, like 2 or 3 times a year. She and I lived with him for 7 months until he threw us out to move in with wife #2 in her state, 2 hours away. He has since tried to force her to leave me and move im with him and force them to only spend time together despite her refusal since he is verbally abusive and controlling. 

He hates me. We are both expected to attend this wedding, and the wife wants my girlfriend to be a bridesmaid, despite only having seen her 4 times since she was 4. My girlfriend doesn't want to go. I really don't want to go. Do you guys think we are obligated? 
























 As a gq lesbian, I don't quite get it as it is. How does it work in general and is it different for transgirls? 




 I know this is pretty insignificant, but today I was on /r/AdviceAnimals and I eealized something really shitty. Every Scum Bag Steve post was ahout general douchey stuff. Every Good Guy Greg post is about general nice thing. However, every Scum Bag Stacy post is about either a girl being a "slut" or a bad mom, and every Good Girl Gina meme seems to be about her sleeping with the guy or being a good homemaker. Does anyone else see this? 














 I am FAAB genderqueer leaning male. For as long as I can remember, I have "felt" a penis, just been unable to see it. I'm just trying to figure stuff out. 





































































 Generally, guys aren't all that clean. And lack of sensitivity is a good thing because you last longer. And, while minimal, it does protect against some STIs.

Edit: thank you all for realizing I was serious and not trolling. Much more to think about for when I eventually have children.  





























 NSFW 









 What were some of your rules, who suggested it, would you do it again? 









 I'm FAAB. I have identified as genderqueer leaning male for almost 5 years now. 

From when I was a kid, I have distinct what I call "trans memories". For one thing, I remember trying to make an STP out of a toilet paper roll. I also remember trying to always have a reason to use the men's room. When I first saw the SVU Episode "Transitions", I cried because I thought that my parents had gotten me a sex change when I was a baby and wondering why they couldn't just love me as the baby boy I assumed I had been born as. 

I'm fairly certain that I am FtM. My family would not accept it. We've already discussed it. My girlfriend says that she would be very much okay with, but I don't think she would be okay with any bodily changes.

I'm wondering if, if I use Androgel, I can gain all of the effects besides facial hair. My family history is very limited body hair growth. My mom's brother's didn't grow facial hair until their thirties and it was then still very limited. My legs only need shaving once a month or less, as it grows so sparingly. Also, how much would my voice change most likely? 




 Added discussion, defend your choices, argue other people's. 




 Feel free to provide screen caps and such for examples. Also, do you frequen it and if so why? 









 Card games like Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity count, as do games like Kerplunk, Hedbanz, etc. 














 When I last left you guys, all was going rather swell. Sadly, since then, everything as fallen apart. Moxie, one of the girls, ate through most of the cardboard I used to make the split. I tried, since it had been a while with no fighting, to introduce them directly, and fighting immediately ensued. I haven't had the time since to work on making them a better divider, but once I do get some time, I'll be sure to let you all know. 









 So, I posted yesterday about introducing my kids with a homemade split cage. They initially fought (or tried) through the screen, but have since gone to seeming to almost ignore eachother. I am switching their sides periodically so they learn the scents, but I want to wait until they are sleeping side by side for a week before I put them all the way together since my boy is so young.  




 I want to breed some gerbils. I love mine, but I know that they will eventually die, so I want a little piece of them left. Also, some friends have said that they want gerbils, and would be good gerbil parents. I have homes lined up, and I am willing to keep any that don't get homed. 

I recently got a baby gerbil, I think about 1-2 months old. He is a little boy, he is solid very dark grey. I also have a pair of girls. One is blonde and and the other is grey and white. They are each in half of a split cage I made.

I used heavy cardboard wrapping paper tubes and window screen materials to make a divider. They can't seem to get through it. 

Wish me luck on this bonding! 














 [I was 17 and drunk for the first time when this happened. My girlfriend's father kept filling my cup with more cider, and I had never even had a sip before this. His girlfriend's six year old beat the living hell out of me.](/spoiler) 




 Also, did you ever get caught? What happened? 









 I am "blessed" with a 40HH chest. I have checked websites like Double Diva's and Casique, but no one seems to carry a bra in my size, particularly one with padding. I prefer padded bras as they hide my nipples more so. If anyone has a website that carries that size and they know it to be reliable, please let me know. 




 I have two female gerbils named Moxie and Roxie that I've had for about 9 months. I also have a little guy named Remy. I've had him for about a month. So far, he has bit me to the point of leaving a scar once, he has made Roxie bleed, and he has bit me hard a second time. They live in separate cages, but I want to breed them, so in a completely open cage without bedding, I was introducing him to Roxie. He doesn't seem to fight with Moxie as much. I got them from separate pet stores, no chance of relation.

I have tried placing their cages side by side, since Moxie is an escape artist, I don't want to risk her getting into his half if I were to split cage them. I have bought Remy special presents, including his own ball, a track to run it on, special treats, and various types of chew toys. He is still very shy and very nasty. 

How can I get him to be nicer?
 




 First ever post on reddit. 

When I was about 3 or 4, (I don't remember the first time) a neighbor kid of mine who was two years older, used to coerce me into doing inappropriate things with him. These started out just as him getting me to kiss him, and then lead to French-kissing, and further to eventually kissing and licking his genitals. He would tell me that if I told he would never talk to me again, and we were best friends. He also would say that if I didn't do what he wanted, he would tell his mom I started it or that I wasn't allowed in his rec room anymore. He had a captains bed, and, in my strongest memory, we were "hiding" in the part that goes near the wall while my brother played Nintendo 64 in the rest of the room.

I have always been aware of what happened to me as a kid. It was just the other day though that someone actually told me that it was abuse. I always pretty much just thought that it was just "kids being kids" or that I was willing. 

I must have been pretty young when it started, because I remember, very vaguely, my dad telling me that if anyone touched me or made me touch them, to tell him. I can remember at that moment wondering if the other kid counted, but I knew the other kid said not to tell.

Later in my life, when I was 13, there was a girl who I had been friends with for my entire life. She was 12. We knew we weren't supposed to, but we put on a DVD, I think it was American Pie, and she decided that we should try "stuff". The next day, for her birthday party, she told me that she told her other friend about all of it, and that her friend then wanted to join because they had done it before. I was pretty much terrified from the previous night, and I certainly didn't want her friend to know, never mind join. However, a few months later, I willingly fooled around with her, (the girl, not her friend), so I don't know if this can really count for anything, since I went back for more. 

I also recently realized that I have a large majority of "symptoms" per se of abused people. I have severe depression, despite the fact that I have a pretty good life. I am incredibly anxious all the time. I have been to the point of suicide more than once. 

What I want to know is, now that I am 18, can I get therapy without insurance? I live in PA. Also, does the second thing count for anything other than stupidity?  





























 It's just so disheartening that they don't understand what donation is and what it's like to not be able to have a kid with the person you love. Forget their lack of respect for their SO's bodily autonomy. 









 About me: I'm 20F and married to a woman. I identify as nonbinary but my mom said I can "get a sex change ten years after" she's dead. My wife is also 20. We've been together nearly five years.

A bit of back story; I had this job working with a guy with Down syndrome. I loved it. I love him. The agency doesn't pay regularly and every two weeks, when my pay was due, I was crying because they somehow fucked me over. This caused me to lose my apartment. I have since quit the job. During my last week, the last week of January, the master cylinder in my car went so I have no brakes. I used my dad's truck for work, and emailed my professors that I couldn't be on campus. I have not gone to class in two weeks and am at risk for being dropped from 18 credits and losing my financial aid.

Last night, he comes home from work and starts yelling at me that the truck is damaged and I drove it last. We live in a college town and have several houses on our street that have college kids. One had a party Friday night. Apparently someone drunk ripped off his mirror. I said I had nothing to do with it, which I didn't, and he starts yelling that I wasted a ton of gas and abused my use of the truck. When I told him that I hadn't used it except to go a mile each night but that on Friday I had a ton to do to get my car fixed, and that I was at risk for failing out of school, he yelled at me that it wasn't his fault and that if I didn't run my car into the ground this wouldn't have happened. 

I told him the master cylinder went on a 10 year old car and there was nothing I could have done. I went  upstairs to grab my stuff to leave and he yelled "don't forget to slam your door" in the douchiest tone possible. 

As I went down the stairs, I said "I'm depressed and can't afford counseling and nobody in this house cares!" And then I left. I called my best friend crying and he came to hang out with me in a local Rite Aid. We tried to drive my car but the brakes are completely gone so my dad told me to take his truck, no reference to previous conversation. My mom hasn't mentioned it either. 

She had known that I was seeing a counselor at my college for about three months and knew it ended with the last semester. She hasn't mentioned except, when I told her I was going, to say that I was "stronger than that". She has known for five years that I have panic attacks but says that's I'm over dramatic. 

How it's a good thing: I have been not going to the hospital for help because I didn't want to disapoint anyone. They don't care. I'm free to go. 

TL;DR: life sucks, then what? 









 I am knitting this for my friend and my idea is that when her little girl outgrows it, it can be her first pillowcase. Is this safe? 


































 If I have a disagreement with my parents about anything, my wife takes their side. She claims she hates confrontation and is trying to avoid a fight but she just makes me livid. 

Today, for instance, my sick and physically disabled mother was struggling to breathe. When asked if she needed to go to the hospital, she made up an excuse about insurance and not wanting to go. My wife said wait until Monday and then if she isn't better she will go. I have class all day on Monday. My mom said wait until Tuesday. My wife agreed with her. 

Tl;dr: MY MOTHER CAN'T BREATHE AND MY WIFE AGREED TO PUT OFF A HOSPITAL VISIT. 









 I have a 1997 850 and the other day the brake light came on. The manual said it needed fluid, and, when I went to go buy fluid, I had no breaks. My brother put some of his in it and we pumped the breaks and it kept seeming to drain but it isn't spraying or leaking anywhere we can see. Anyone know what's wrong and if it's an easy fix? 




 I think I want T in the future, but I know I want to give birth and breastfeed. If I go on T before that, how likely am I to become infertile? Will I be able to breastfeed? I want to do gel if that matters because I want as much control as possible over results. 




 I have some really severe suicidal ideation, including a preferred method if I were to do so. However, I don't intend to. My understanding is that ER staff do not discriminate between suicidal ideation and suicidal intent. Is this accurate? Do I need to distinguish which I am experiencing?

My mom is physically disabled and rather sick. Since I am self admitting, can I leave if there is an emergency with my family? If so do I need to make this concern clear ahead of time?

I know that, at my hospital, if you have a baby or are sick, your spouse can stay with you overnight once in a while. Is this possible for this situation?

How much say over visitors do I get? My mom can't go and my dad won't so I would really rather be able to just say I don't want them there, but I do want my wife to be able to see me. Is this possible? 

Since I am planning ahead, am I not sick enough or is it not an emergency enough that I should go?

What I need is medication. If possible, I'd like to get a prescription and get out of there. I don't have health insurance or free clinics near me and I'm broke. I'd rather not get even more behind in school if I can avoid it. Can that happen?

Does my college have to be accommodating to this? I'm a first semester sophomore at a community college and I'm taking 18 credits, 3 of them writing intensive. Do they have to be lenient with me or can they fail me over it? Last semester I saw a counselor at my school and we were supposed to work on finding me real help but my insurance fell through. She diagnosed me with depression and anxiety but it's not on paper anywhere. She seemed scared and insistant that I get help ASAP but I really couldn't. Is that relevant or helpful to me?

When I get nervous, I smile, laugh, and joke. In high school when I tried to get help at the safe room, they didn't belive me because of it. I really can't control it. Will the hospital do the same thing?

Is there anything I'm not thinking of that may be important?

Edit: I'm 20 but married. Will I be with kids or adults or adolescents? I live in Pennsylvania for reference. 









 I've poked around and even posted here a bit before, but here goes, I suppose.

I'm Trish/Patric. I'm genderqueer transmasculine. I'm not picky about pronouns at all. Use whatever you like.  My wife and my best friend, who is a transguy, are the only people I'm out to really at the moment. I don't intend to be out to my immediate family. Top surgery is a definite and T is a maybe, bottom surgery is a no go for me. Feel free to ask me whatever you'd like to know. 




 I have diagnosed clinical depression and anxiety and have for almost a decade. For me, that means insomnia and not caring about myself at all. Typically, an adult can bounce back and at least bother to do the bare minimum. I was 11 or 12, though, and not caring developed into terrible habits, that, at 20, I'm still struggling to kick. 

When I joined reddit a bit over a year ago, and came across SCA, I subscribed because I've always been lucky to have great skin, so I figured I might enjoy learning to actually wash my face. It took another nine months or so before I actually used it, but hey, I did eventually. 

Since then, I've started to remember to brush my teeth regularly. I know, gross, but being young and depressed is making bad choices. I've also started to drink water almost exclusively. I'm chubby, by like a lot, and have always been the kind of kid to cut gym class and hang out somewhere else, even if somewhere else is a bathroom. I've started using my college fitness center by choice. 

SCA has really helped me make some positive changes in my life, and I thank all of you for that. 




 My college has a free fitness center available to students. I'm finally taking advantage of it. I'm heavy. Depression will do that to you, as I'm sure a lot of you know. I don't care about losing weight right now. I'm just happy to be able to take the steps without getting winded. Today was day three of roughly 20 minute workouts and already I feel better physically. It doesn't seem to help my depression like people claim it will, but physically its not bad and I even find myself enjoying after years of cutting gym in high school. It's something at least. 









 Married: 1 month, 10 days.

Number of times we've had sex: 17.

Highlights: 10 were in the first week of being married. 

On our wedding night, you fell asleep with my nipple in your mouth, throwing me into a panic attack. I still count that time. 

You've gone down on me once, and you weren't happy about it. 

I love you but dammit baby you're supposed to want to have sex with your new wife. If we did the penny jar first year thing, we couldn't buy a McChicken at the end of the year.


Edit: thank you guys for being so supportive. I was in a bad spot last night when I posted this. I have diagnosed depression and anxiety and one of my symptoms when I get seriously upset is that I can't sleep, which manifested into this. My wife and I (yes, we're lesbians for those of you who expressed confusion) communicate endlessly. She has a lower sex drive than me and I need to get over it. Last night I was upset because, I after I went down on her and then got her off a second time, she had no interest in either going down on me or otherwise doing what I like. We have discussed it multiple times and I need to learn to accept it. Prior to getting married we averaged 3 to 4 times every week. Our wedding week ramped it up and I'm just hating the slow down. She has PCOS so hormone stuff is totally wacky meaning her libido is, too, but it sucks to be 20 and have her have a low sex drive. 




 I have what my best friend, who's a transguy, and I call "trans memories" which are memories from childhood that, if it happened now, you would know that you were trans*. For me, these include being seven and trying to use a toilet paper roll as an STP; being 10 and seeing the "Transitions" episode of Law and Order: SVU and crying because I thought my parents must have had me surgically made into a girl when I was born. Also during my childhood, I had plenty of experience being reminded that my mom knew when she found out she was pregnant with me that I would be a healthy girl because God didn't give her 16 years of not being able to get pregnant to give her another boy (I have two older adopted brothers and my parents fostered over 40 boys in the mid 80s). Whenever I wear my binder, which I have been a lot lately thanks to you guys giving me advice on it, she makes comments about how I look deformed and says that I must be binding in the most disgusted voice. I'm out to her as a butch lesbian, but when I came out she told me I had to wait until 10 years after she was dead if I was going to become a guy. She accepts other transpeople she just doesn't want it for me. It's hard. I'm just starting to feel better in my skin and she makes fun of me... I can't be out to her. It would kill her. She's physically disabled with a whole list of medical problems. It just sucks. 




 I work 17.5 hours every week, I have 18 credit hours this semester, I take care of my disabled mom and I need to do well this semester to graduate on time. I transport my wife to and from her job, too. My dad expects me to do everything. Today he told me brother (who does nothing. I repeat, nothing at all. He plays video games and sponges off of my family and his girlfriend. He's almost 19.) To tell me I had to get the balance of his debit card. They are both more than capable and I already do so much else and I didn't want to so I refused. He started harassing me about how I eat off the money so I can do it. He gets my food almost never. 

My wife and I both work. If we don't have enough after bills, my mom will get us food. I left. I wanted a cigarette so fucking bad but I'm trying not to smoke this year. Also, I don't have any money to buy a pack with. I want to die so bad. It's always little bullshit like this, but it adds up. It sounds so fucking stupid that this makes me feel this way. 

I'm quitting my job in 2 weeks because they often don't bother to pay me and I have to wait forever for my money. That's why my wife and I live with my parents. I feel like a goddamn failure. I'm 20, married, doing well enough for me in school (I have a 3.08) and I love my job but they don't pay me so I have to live at home. It fucking sucks. I know I won't kill myself. I have too much responsibility to kill myself. One day it will get better. But right now it fucking sucks. 


My school councilor diagnosed me with depression and anxiety but she can't really do anything to help. I don't have money for a doctor or insurance so I'm just fucking stuck. I can't check out of life for a week to get help because of all the fucking responsibility. I'm sorry for the wall of text. I just sort of needed to vent and all.

Edit: You guys are so great. I don't have a response right now for each of you, but know that you help me greatly. I ended up hanging out with a friend tonight and walking around the mall locally. I don't know if I'll go to the hospital any time soon, honestly. My wife won't have a way to get to and from school without me. That's not fair to her. Honestly, I'm scared. We haven't slept apart for more than one night since I was like 16. I don't want to be without her for that long.  




 I have a full torso binder, but it rolls too much so I'm trying to fold it up and over like some dudes suggested the other day. It's great for my chest, but I feel like I look pregnantish. Did anyone else feel this way at first? When did that feeling go away? I am trying to lose weight, but I'm pre or non T (not sure yet) so my body fat is very female distrusted. 



















 Where did you find binding/packing materials and the like? How did you get information about therapists and HRT? It's tough enough now with the Internet to help, but I can't figure out how it was done before then. 




 I have and Underworks 997 binder and a very large chest. While it does a pretty good job of flattening me, it will roll up on occasion, and it's very difficult to get it back down without my wife's help. Has anyone else had this problem? How can I keep this from happening?  
























 My job requires paperwork to be done at home, on my time. It takes three times as long to do it by hand as by computer, so I computerized all of it and have no access to the means to do it by hand. I have the forms that must be filled already partially and incorrectly filled in Excel, but no access to fix it. My job has already withheld my pay for 3 weeks and it will likely be 3 more or even longer before I see my money. I cannot afford to pay for the one month subscription. If anyone is willing to let me use their login just temporarily, I would really appreciate it. 







































 I don't care about the discrimination I face. I don't care that teachers bullied me in high school. I care that my mom and so many other people say that if I had the choice I'd have chosen to be straight. I wouldn't. I love everything about being gay. I love gay culture, I love having a cause, I love my wife, I love going to pride. I love being gay. Why is that such a bad thing? That really gets me down... 




 The character, who's name escapes me, dies in Phoenix with his boyfriend and I think his mother. The hospital disposes of his body wrapped in a garbage bag with other garbage. His boyfriend pays a funeral establishment to have him cremated despite the hospital's refusal to issue a death certificate. I have tried to Google this, but I can't come up with anything definitively confirming or denying it. 




 My job doesn't pay me when or what or how they're supposed to and it's really contributed to my mounting depression and anxiety. 

In high school, I started the Gay Straight Alliance for my school. Today I found out that my successor's successor, whom I selected for the role, got into her dream school with a full merit scholarship strongly because of her role as President of the GSA. She Facebook messaged me and thanked me for giving her the opportunity to reach this goal. 

It helped me to realize that I have a positive impact on people's lives and gave me the boost I needed to send this email. I don't even know if the place is hiring, but I tried, and for that I'm proud of myself. 

Today was a good day, Reddit. 




 I'm pretty upset for good reason and sitting in a McDonald's typing this, so sorry if it's all jumbled and fucked up.

We recently moved back in with my parents because my job doesn't like to pay me correctly and we couldn't keep up with our rent. My 18 year old brother is prince of the mother fucking earth. He does whatever the fuck he wants, including, tonight, when he came in the bathroom while I was showering and turned on the sink water and started flipping out and calling me names because I let his stupid ass dog in his room so it wouldn't shit on my goddamn flood. Big surprise, the fucking puppy shit on the floor. He should have taken the fucking dog out or put it in it's crate if he wasn't going to be able to take it out. I told him to turn the water off because the family dog had just puked all over me and I was trying to get cleaned off. He wouldn't. I told him to get the fuck out of the bathroom. He said "Or what, you'll sit on me?" 

I ran to my room and got dressed. I went downstairs and told my parents that SOMETHING needs to be done about their goddamn hellion. My dad said "I hate to say it, but I think it's time you find a place to live." My wife and I left and came to this McDonald's. I don't know what the fuck to do from here. We have no money, about 200$ in food stamps and a quarter of a tank of gas. I have to work tomorrow and I know they won't fucking pay me anyway. We just finished the last day of our semester of college, so switching to dorming isn't possible right now. I don't know what to do. 

If you're just commenting to tell me I'm awful, please, save it.

**tl;dr**: My brother's the best and I think I'm homeless. 














 Faux Thanksgiving was the Tuesday after the normal holiday; all of the talk was about her 18 year old, single, uneducated, unemployed, knocked up sister. That's fine. It was all super positive and everyone (except those of us with brains) is excited for her. My wife's aunt and uncle were there. They didn't say hello to me and only spoke to me to show me a picture of their dog. They also walked past me to say goodbye to others and didn't acknowledge me again. Then, we found out, her mother and said knocked up sister started shit talking us as soon as we left. 

Her mother originally did not intend to come to our wedding. After she was called out on it, she decided she would show up. Knocked up sister had an appointment and didn't show up. Mother made fun of our venue, made fun of my wife's outfit and feet, and complained that it was too small of a wedding. She left as soon as possible, no congratulations were offered and she texted later asking for her Crock Pot back since she forgot it. She owes my wife 15 dollars for a Mary Kay item and we haven't seen the money despite asking several times and really needing the money, and I felt it was ballsy to ask for it back when she owes us.

Last night was the family Christmas party. The only people who said hello to me were my MIL's ex roomate who felt awkward that everyone was ignoring me and my wife's other aunt. The pregnant sister tried to push me down some stairs and everyone else pretty much just ignored me. My wife was said hello to, I was just ignored.

My wife also has 3 younger sisters; they're 15, 15, and 13. I went all out on gifts for them. They're great kids and we get along great. I do not feel at all motivated or obligated to get gifts for the mother or other sister for Christmas. I need my money more. I am sick of going to things like this to be treated like shit. I hate it.

 :D 









 I'm a lesbian and a United Methodist. If this sub isn't really a gay friendly one, can anyone direct me to one that is? I'm working on trying to get over my depression, and seeing homophobic posts won't help. 









 I hope this is okay here; just subscribed today and this is my first post here. Sorry if it's not okay.


I unsubscribed from a lot of the defaults with the whole "bro culture" thing going on and am hoping it will help, since I let the comments and what not affect me too much. If it doesn't help, I'm probably going to leave reddit for a while, or at least delete the app from my phone, because for the last year, my depression has gotten worse and the main change has been my use of reddit that has gone up drastically, especially over the last several months. I dunno. I guess I'm just trying.  




 Are any littles... nonhuman? My little's "character" is a baby bear (age 5 and a half) named Meribell. Is name changing typical too? I also have a "character" that's a little who is a baby horse (age 4 and a half) named Ponyo. Is that at all common? Her "real" self is the big to my little and vice versus. Sometimes the littles play together and get into mischief. Does that happen for anyone else? It's also 100% non sexual. We're actually both turned off by the idea of including littles in sexual stuff. Is that at all common? I read the FAQ but I guess I'm a little confused about if we qualify? 









 She is 20, almost 21, and we have been together for over four years. She is likes to talk about fairies and princesses and has this intense love for all things "cute and chubby" as she puts it, meaning adorably pudgy dogs and bunnies and the like. She loves to tell bedtime stories before we go to sleep, which usually either center around fairies, princesses, or horses. She is obsessed with horses, but without a real desire to own one.

It's the cutest thing in the world. I can't wait for us to get married in a little over a week. I hope she never grows up. 














 /r/BoiFashionAdvice/

/r/MaleFashionAdvice tends not to help us out much, though their style is great, and /r/LesbianFashionAdvice is dead and focuses primarily on femmes. I created something for those of us who are bois, and fall somewhere south of masculine but not quite feminine either. 









 Edit: I didn't mean medical services sucked, I meant administration. Also, why doesn't the ACA help with this? Or has it just not yet? I get that vets shouldn't have to, but with the demand they may benefit from going outside the VA. I just feel like there is a lot I don't get. 



















 Bought a pack about a month ago. Wondering what they'll be like and for how long.  









 I personally like to fall asleep to audio books. I don't like to pay for them just to fall asleep. They're free on YouTube. 









 My girlfriend and I had been getting pretty heavy before she left for work. We had agreed that, when she got home, sexy times were to be had. Since we are currently living with my parents, they have to be sort of planned. 

Being a good girlfriend, I decided to wash our collection while I was in the shower, and left them out to dry on her towel, with it folded over. The family dog comes in, and, being the good dog that she is, starts snuggling me. When my girlfriend got home, I had shown her that I washed everything, so the towel was folded up, and everything was exposed.

Now I'm sure plenty of you are thinking that my dog grabbed one and brought it to my mom. That, happily, is not what happened. My brother came in my room to see if I wanted him to get the dog. After he left, I glanced over at the dog, and, between her and I, was a towel covered in sex toys. My brother just left and I'm hoping he decides to avoid talking to me until he forgets about this.

TL;DR I washed my sex toys then put them on display for my brother. 




 My soon-to-be-wife and I will be most likely attending Smith in about a year. We want to start a queer girl Four Seasons cover band. Anyone with knowledge or interest, feel free to comment! 




 Ask anything you wanna know, even if it's offensive. I will answer anything. 
























 I am a full time student. I am extremely intelligent, as awkward as it is for me to proclaim that. My GPA is falling fast.

I am the only daughter and despite the fact that my father is still married to and lives with my mom, I am the one primarily if not soley responsible for her care now that she is disabled. No one else will do anything for her but me.

I work as a companion to a man with Down Syndrome. I have for almost a year and a half. I go out of my way to better his life. No raise or even a thank you. I work until 10 most Fridays with a 10 hour day so he can belong to a bowling league and I get no praise. The paperwork tripled and I can't keep up with it and everything else and I haven't been paid my hours in 2 months and my gas reimbursement in 3 and a half. 

I am so burnt out.

Edit: I think I misexplained. I haven't been paid because I can't keep up with the paper work required to get my pay. I have to write the equivalent of a one page essay on the guy every night, plus the math for the mileage, and I just can't keep up. I was promised it would decrease after I complained, but it hasn't. It's my fault I haven't been paid.

This a picture of my stuffed doll, Baby. I got her 20 years ago for my first Christmas. She originally had an attached blanket on her wrist (left I believe) that was cut off from being holey when I was a kid. My understanding is that she was a FisherPrice doll that came in blue, yellow, or, like mine, pink terrycloth. Clearly, she has grown tattered over the years. I am hoping to be able to purchase another one. I have tried various searches over the last several years, and if you have any direction to offer, please feel free. Thank you. 




 I want genital changes and not really facial or body hair. Is this possible? 



















 I'm genderqueer, sorta somewhere not quite sure, but I'd like to have the possibility in the event that I choose to medically transition. I am applying for Obamacare in a few days and I was just wondering. I live in Pennsylvania if it matters. 




 My girlfriend, or well, fiance, and I are getting married December 10th! I am SO happy. We had originally planned our wedding for spring of 2016, but recently learned that if we did that, she would not be able to get financial aid for college. We are having a quick ceremony with a district magistrate and then having a small party. We are announcing it as our engagement, and that's great by me. She's happy about it, too. I am just so happy and wanted to share. 



















 I have been out for almost six years. I have been with my partner for over four. Last night, though we've had sex, even great sex, before, was the first time I've ever truly made love to a woman.

For the first time, I didn't emotionally compare it to what my expectations of sex with a man are. For one, they're unrealistic as I've never had sex with a man, and for two, it is so stupid to try to compare sex with a woman to sex with a man.

For the first time, I didn't have to fantasize to orgasm. Generally, I think about something I've read or watched, not really filling myself or my partner into any of the roles. It also generally involves a man. Last night, I didn't. When I tried to in order to finish faster, it made it more difficult. I didn't have to think at all; just feel.

For the first time, I was completely satisfied after I finished. I didn't really crave anything else. Typically, after my partner has gone to sleep, I will get myself off one more time before I fall asleep. Last night I had no desire to do that.

For the first time, I didn't concentrate on what might be best for her while she's touching me. I paid attention to me, since it was my "turn" anyway. I generally do whatever it takes to finish fast for her so she isn't left spending a million years on me. Last night, I just cared about what felt good and let myself enjoy it.

We discussed it afterword, and she felt the same way. She is the only woman I've ever dated, though, since I'm not even 20 and we've been together so long, it isn't that surprising. I'm the only woman she has ever dated. I guess there is still a bit of a learning curve, but I'm really looking forward to experiencing this and more again.  












































 My girlfriend has three little sisters; twin 15yo and the other will be 14 in the beginning of January. The twins have been asking my advice on skin care because mine is flawless (THANK YOU FOR TEACHING ME!) and they both have acne rather bad. The younger one has great skin but care isn't a bad thing and she's a copycat and would love it. Now, about their skin.

Twins; both girls have normal to oily skin, leaning slightly more toward oily. Both have acne, primarily in the form of white heads and some scarring due to their mother doing extractions. They are allergic to salicylic acid. Their goals are to clear up acne and my goal for them is to teach them the importance of skin care even when your skin is clear. Their skin is the opposite of mine so I don't really know what they need. They are on hormonal birth control to help control their acne as well.

Younger sister; normal skin that is clear with minor breakouts now and then but nothing extreme. Also allergic to salicylic acid, so my routine goes out the window dispite having very similar skin. She desires to prevent breakouts and be like her sisters. 

If you have specific product recommendations or anything to avoid, please, any advice helps. 




 My girlfriend and I have been together four years and are 19 and 20. My parents are rather poor and provide housing for us but we are responsible for our own food and cell phones and we pay the electric bill. My girlfriend's parents are both very well off and provide absolutely nothing for her, including emotional support. Their incomes have both increased dramatically over the last year, and her younger sister is no longer a dependent so her financial aid will be terrible and she does not benefit from her parents' money at all.


We live in a state with same sex marriage and are willing to go that route, as we plan to marry next spring anyway, but we would prefer to wait until then if possible. Can she get declared independent otherwise?

 My girlfriend is the oldest of five girls and was born to her mother when her mother and father were 19. She has a very poor relationship with her father and a so-so one with her mother. Her three youngest sisters and her get along great, but her other sister, the only one with the same father as my girlfriend, has had issues with my girlfriend since we got together. She has actively tried to ruin our relationship and give my girlfriend's parents false information about me to get them to hate me as well. It worked with her father.

Tonight, we went to dinner at her mom's for the first time in over six months. Her mother was insistent that my girlfriend get into contact with her sister. My girlfriend has been trying to talk to her sister, but her sister has no interest as, this summer, when her sister got "engaged" to a man she has known for 2 months and been dating for one, my girlfriend texted her asking exactly how long they had been together. We found out about her engagement via Facebook. Her mother, after my girlfriend's explanation, showed my girlfriend ultrasound pictures with sister's name on them. She is due in April.

My girlfriend tried to contact her sister through call and text, she ignored the texts and literally made sounds like she had no signal on the phone. She intentionally went to her friend's house so she wouldn't see us. Also, she and the "fiance" broke up and she is moving 3 hours away to live with their dad next week.

My girlfriend wants to be involved, but was asked not to let on that she knew. She wants to see her before she leaves as well. We have no idea what she should do.

**tl;dr**: Sister is pregnant and hiding it and won't talk to us and is moving away in a week. 



















 Also feel free to share any other relevant information such as if it was your first attempt at learning the language, etc. 









 Ma'am,
You passed so well that after walking away from you my girlfriend and I commented to each other on it. I assure you no one else was reading you. But I did. I read you when we made eye contact and you looked terrified that you thought I knew. It wasn't your height, even though you stood several inches above my 5'5". It wasn't your face, which was just as feminine as any other lady's face. It was your lack of confidence and fear that made me see any other indicators. I wanted in that moment so badly to hug you and tell you it was all okay and not to be so worried. Walmart at midnight may not be the safest place, but it also isn't the worst. No one even knew. You were just as safe as all other women in that store were and I wish there had been a way for me to communicate that to you. I hope my subtle smile and aversion of my eyes after our eye contact didn't further freighten you or make you think you didn't pass. I am proud of you for being yourself and presenting in public. I hope youbhave the courage to do it again, and maybe next time, if I see you, I'll have a better way to show you that I support you. 

Signed, 
The Lesbian from 2368. 









 We were riding in the car chatting about how, the previous night, she wanted me to cuddle her because she was feeling sick and I wanted sex because I was feeling horny. In order to not bother her, I opted to watch porn when she fell asleep. All in good fun, she was ribbing me about the fact that I hate her because I didn't cuddle her. I corrected her and said that I didn't cuddle her because I hate her is what she meant. Then, Reddit, I fucked up. I said "I don't hate you because you're fat, you're fat because I hate you." 




 I know Reddit circle jerks about how stupid it is but I don't know what it is. Please explain. 














 I'm sorry if this isn't allowed but I didn't know where else to ask. I work as a companion to a 29 year old man with Down Syndrome. Socially amd emotionally, I'd guess he's between 12 and 14, but he is illiterate to the point of not knowing the alphabet.  

We have rules about his cell phone. He isn't to call me before 7:50 am ever. Last week we added the rules that on Mondays I will call him at 10am to chat since I have off and don't want to be up that early and if he needs to call and I don't pick up, he calls once and I will call back.

In July we had a big issue because he called me at 6:30 in the morning. He hasn't been allowed to visit with some questionable friends since. Last Monday, he called at 7:30, leading to the establishment of the additional cell phone rules. 

Yesterday morning, while he knew I was on vacation, he called me four times between 7:52 am and 9:30 am. I chose not to call him because he gave up that privilege when he broke the rules. We spoke about it briefly this morning while I drove him to work and he says he won't do it again but I know he will and, rather than apologizing for his actions, he apologized for the fact that I was upset with him. 

What can I do to help set some better, stronger boundaries and get him to stick to them? Games and stuff are fine as long as they aren't geared at two year olds or overly wordy. Thank you so much! 









 Eateries you like, anything gay, whatever. 














 My girlfriend and I (lesbians) have managed to acquire a JW lady who keeps coming to us. We couldn't turn her away the first time because she came with my girlfriend's aunt, who is a Witness. Now the woman keeps coming back and even purchased each of us a "Bible" and another book. We don't want to convert, and we don't want to stop being lesbians. How do we nicely tell her we aren't even remotely interested without hurting her feelings? 




 I disagree with 99.9% of the things Reddit circlejerks about. 

I am a feminist, Chrisitan, lesbian who identifies as genderqueer. 

Basically, the majority of Reddit's outspoken members hate me and the feeling is rather mutual. I have been here almost a year and don't know why I keep coming back. 



















 Moving back with my parents soon to a 10' by 7' bedroom with 8' ceilings and three doorways. How would you make the most of this space? 









 We compared tongue size. When I woke up this morning I understood why guys compare dick size. 





























 I know you fart more because of contractions in the uterus also cause some in the GI tract, but why are they so smelly? 
























 It may be worth considering that you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. 




 So because you don't know a word I can't use it? The word existed long before I used it. 




 Do you have a question? 




 Is there a question? 




 My wife stacks her pills and doesn't deal with that  




 It's rarely relevant. Most people don't even know what it is and my preferred pronouns are obvious from my appearance, so there is no need to express such.  




 Not really a problem, but I appreciate your drunken concern. 




 Sorry, I was out car shopping.

I would say that in the sense that I experience dysphoric feelings, it's a disorder, though in the sense that something is "wrong" with me, I wouldn't. I learned in psychology in college that to be considered a mental illness, it has to cause negativity in your life. If you hear voices but they are encouraging and good, you're not mentally ill, despite the fact that it may be inconvenient. Based on that, while the dysphoric feelings suck, they don't in any way hinder my life, so no, I'm not experiencing a mental disorder or illness.

I don't know the cause. My "brain map" of my body isn't correct to what my body actually is. That seems like it's either psychological or body related. I don't much care how I'm perceived but I present more masculine, so that is a societal or environmental factor. 

I began identifying as genderqueer at around 14 or 15. I'm 20 now. I had a friend who came out as a transman and was doing research when I fell upon the term and it fit like a glove. I have memories from childhood that I call "signs I was trans". I can remember being 7 trying to make a prosthetic penis to pee through with a toilet paper roll. I can remember being about 9 and seeing an episode of SVU about transpeople and crying because I assumed by parents did that to me as a baby and couldn't just love me as the boy I was born as. I can remember praying for my period at 12 because I thought I would actually feel like a girl when I got it and it would prove that I was born one and was supposed to be one.  




 Yes, I have depression and anxiety. However, that has nothing to do with my gender identity. I have no other diagnosis so I won't claim any other.  




 http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderqueer

http://gender.wikia.com/wiki/Transmasculine 




 Yes and no. One can simply identify as genderqueer, which is something of an umbrella term, and not wish to make any changes. I don't identify as 100% man 100% of the time, so I feel transman isn't fitting, but genderqueer is, however I am actually making an effort to transition just toward what exactly isn't quite defined. 

Edit: I'm the only female child in my family so female pronouns. I don't want to hurt my parents. 




 I read through his filmography on Wikipedia to answer your question, and, while I recognized many titles, I've never seen any. I don't really like movies, though. 




 It means that, while I don't wish to fully transition to being a man 100% of the time, I do wish to transition to being more masculine. The difference between this and simply being masculine is that I make changes, like binding my chest, to do so. I also will have my breasts removed eventually.  




 I think people should do whatever they want, provided it harms no one else. For me, I like having a label that I feel fits me. 

I've never seen anything with Bill Murray in it.  









 None of those subs are all that specific. Twox is only specifically about women and politics is only specifically about politics, based on name alone. /r/dicksprinkles is specific but not biased. 




 Got mine free on Facebook. The people were moving and needed to get rid of it, my wife and I wanted to upgrade from our full to a queen. It sits on a platform my dad and I built together and it's wonderful. 




 Consider adoption, if you and your wife can love an adopted baby the same way as a biological one. No shame if you can't, though, adoption isn't for everyone. My older brothers are both adopted since my parents "couldn't have kids" and they they had my younger brother and I biologically. It's great and I'm far closer to my adopted brother than my biological one. 




 I got one pair in 9th grade. They fell apart in less than six months.  




 You didn't bang a first time and objectification of OP isn't the way to get there anyway. 




 XI is 11. VI is 6. Just for future reference.  




 Wow... abusive much? Do you know anyone with PCOS and how there are various levels of seriousness of it and symptoms?  




 Go to church, pray in school, read the bible, etc. 




 Far the hell away from? 




 That's a line to get more than a handjob.  




 My mom got fired from selling Tupper Ware in the 80s because she got diagnosed with cancer and didn't have a party for three weeks. It was bullshit. 




 Mine has helped me a lot. He doesn't do anything questionable, either. He willingly sends people to orthopedic surgeons when needed. He performs x-rays and I have heard him tell people he can't help them. Most of my program included exercising the injured site, starting with passive stretching by a licensed massage therapist and then with help from a licensed personal trainer. He explains immediately in your first visit that he is not a medical doctor and if that makes you uncomfortable you are free to go elsewhere. My wife has PCOS and I speculated so for about six months. He met her once when she came with me and the next appointment he told me he thought she had it and that she needed to see a gynecological doctor immediately. He was right, obviously, and never tried to make me bring her for adjustments to help her. He stated that she needed hormonal treatment most likely in the form of birth control, which is right. I appreciate mine so much. He has been such a help in my life. 




 You went to a quack, that doesn't make all chiropractors quacks. Mine is great. He helped me with injuries from a car accident and has never pushed the herbal remedies he sells on me, just helps me with my back, as he is employed to do.  




 The point is that I disagree with something for my own arbitrary reasons. That doesn't mean I have to think other people can't do that thing.

Edit: the porn of little people I have seen looks like children and that freaks me out, if that's what you were asking. 




 I think that watching midget porn is gross and creepily close to childporn and wrong but others have the choice to do so. 




 But the pharmaceutical companies want their money and will do anything to harm you and your family to get it!!!!!!!!! 




 Uhm no. I'm a woman married to a woman. I am high libido, she is low. Marriage has nothing to do with money; it's about love and commitment. I don't make any money as I'm unemployed at the moment and I want more sex. You are so wrong. 




 That's what I meant; hippies and wiccans alike are counter culture with strong, far from mainstream beliefs. As a recently former teenage girl, they (we?) Get a bad rep for insisting they are something they know nothing about, but that's just teens in general.  




 WHO NEEDS A HOUSE OUT IN HACKENSACK? 




 Wiccans get a bad rep because they are like the equivalent of hippies, and teenage girls think they are Wiccan.  




 Honestly, in schools. World Religions is required in a lot of places. When I learned it in sixth grade, we learned of the Abrahamic religions (and a bunch of others) but not how they were connected; my mom explained it. It would help cure a lot of hatred. 




 A poor people rock where geography isn't a priority. 




 Dude. I get you mean to be sweet, but you are sort of treating OP like a commodity. Good effort, bad approach.  




 I have a fear to the point of a full blown phobia. I will probably have nightmares from these pictures tonight and I can't even go near a snake if I have a lawn mower. I am petrified of them. Though, I am working on it with subs like that one. 




 How many people do you live with. 




 Heiney? 




 Snakes terrify me. But I totally agree. I love the way that community fawns over their little guys and girls the same way I do my buns. It takes some of the terror out. 




 Touch.  




 I also got married. At 20. My wife would have had to drop out so we got hitched. Still very happy about that decision.  









 Well there are. Guys can even do it missionary. It's not that complex. 




 Probably all the aftermath of the last episode. The wreckage of their lives. Jesus either dead or in boarding school, and coping with that change. Ana either dead or fighting to keep her baby. Marianna dealing with her brother gone and possibly her bio mom and/or sister. Responsibility for the accident and what about Brandon's car? The kiss with Monte and Lena and if that wrecks the marriage of Stef and Lena, which I doubt it will. Just my predictions.  




 You two look great. 




 When it comes up 3 years in a seemingly life long relationship it's childish. He has strung OP along for three years. 









 Iam*Judger*AMA 




 I agree. Obviously if your health and safety depend on it, then it's fine, but being stealth is being a closet case and being a closet case helps no one. Don't expect others to stand for your rights if you won't stand for them.  




 "Hunk" and "Future Model" type shirts don't get to me. At that point, babies don't have much to offer but their looks. Nothing wrong with saying they're beautiful, male or female. Now, by 6 months when they are actually doing things, it's about accomplishments.  




 I'd like you to join us over at The Gay Agenda ^^^tm. Just look us up in the rainbow pages. 




 I thought bikers stole chaps from Cowboys and leprechauns stole rainbows from Noah/God and "normies" stole marriage from religion? It's almost like cultural shifts occur. 




 I thought this was /ftm and I was like "Honey... you're beautiful but you REALLY look like a girl." Then I realized that was exactly what you were going for you you're still beautiful and still look like a girl. 




 Or just learn to tuck. 




 11 year old me would have totally wanted 11 year old you. Then we both would grow up to be gay. 




 It's cool. I'm 20 and Harry Styles is the only man for me. Love me some 1D. 




 Dude no. My mom still won't "let" me have black hair in my face and I'm still pissed I couldn't be emo in middle/high school. Own that shit. 




 Beetlejuice is great! It's a dark comedy and a family story.  




 There's four of us. My mother in law is EXACTLY like Mother Gothel. My wife and I love it for that reason.  




 You loved her, and at some point only wanted the best for her. Continue that. Wish her happiness. And you will find it, too.  




 I'd have yelled at you too. The fuck is wrong with you thinking you should be a woman at 8? 




 Yes 




 I'm the person who's car got stolen. I was hit on Thursday two weeks ago. The adjuster ignored calls and didn't inform me that he was taking my car. I hadn't even agreed to the amount he offered. I showed up today to have my car cleaned out to learn he towed it an hour away with all of my stuff in it. 




 Posting for a friend.

Today, I finally got around to dealing with an accident that happened two weeks ago. I work for a company that rhymes with smationsmide. They haven't sent the title because I've been avoiding their calls and so today I got them good. I stole their car and didn't tell them and shipped it an hour away with all of their stuff in it. They have no money, no car, and none of their stuff now and I got them good! 




 Walmart as a corporation has phenomenal equality provisions. The do not discriminate at all. Specifically the store by me, there are employees of every race; employees that don't speak English, deaf employees, those with cerebral palsy or chromosomal defects, LGBT employees and more. 

My mom worked at Walmart for 14 years and was exposed to the ins and outs. A specific store may have problems with this, but as a corporation Walmart isn't as bad as people try to say. 




 Mostly, yeah, if you never wake up you die. 




 As a Pennsylvanian with friends from New England, this war happens every time we play Monopoly but I know I'm right so it's okay.  




 It also sort of glorifies cutting in Specials. My mom was nervous about me reading that at 12/13. 




 On Scott Westerfeld's website there was talk of a TV series. I think that would kill it though. 




 You mean the post-apocalyptic series that is far better than The Hunger Games and Divergent but isn't a movie yet? 




 20/F/PA.

U? 




 /u/TrollaBot test_subject6752 




 We waited until exactly two days after I turned 20 because we didn't want to be another "teen marriage" statistic lol.  




 Did you just change your diet or add exercise? 




 I got married in December at age 20. My wife and I have been together four and a half years. I don't think it's always too soon or too young. 









 I'm genderqueer afab. I like porn in that realm because I would like to *be* the pre/non op transwoman. I want to have my dick sucked and my boobs played with. Though, I rarely consume such porn because it's so transphobic and it makes me feel guilty. 




 It's the kind of tree you get golf tees from. 




 Yeah. That's pretty homophobic. Why are you here if you're just going to make lesbian jokes? 




 It's sexist because it's impossible the description only fits girls. And the opposite can not only fit men. 




 I'm thinking (and hoping) that he/she is suggesting that people properly train before using firearms because in his/her experience that isn't the case and it can be incredibly dangerous.

FTFY
 




 Oh. Wow I feel like a dick. Whenever I post a screen cap I get shit for my phone font. I have a galaxy s4 and the font is called Choco Cooky.  




 My preference.  




 With the proper training and licenses, But lets not make this standard. Some of the people I have known shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a gun.  


Why be sexist?
 




 1. Lemon juice had citric acid, which is awful for you. Look for it in ingredients when shopping.

2. Huge granulated sugar is not good. Chemical exfoliation is better for you. 

I'm sure there are others but that's what jumped out at me.

Edit: apparently I'm wrong. Live and learn. 




 "Natural" people scare me. They are generally intelligent enough to research and learn but they believe blatantly biased sources.  




 She probably would have been better off getting sunburn and taking a brillo pad to it. At least then she'd be admitted and they would take away the lemons and sugar. 




 An extra two dollars a box for someone to write the word on it.  









 Victoria's? 




 Smirnoff Ice tastes exactly like Jolly Ranchers. 




 Ibuprofen doesn't have a diuretic or antihistamine, both of which help clear up mucus and make things flow a bit better. 




 I could say it ain't so but darlin, what's the use?

The darker the chocolate yhe richer the taste

Now if that's where it's at then run and tell that!


I didn't know the soundtrack to Hairspray was considered rap. 




 I'm gonna kill you!

(You're welcome)


 




 And he can take it whenever he wants no questions asked and transport whoever he wants and whatever he wants. I'm sure he is also free to repaint it chartreuse and add orange flames. Since the car is his and all. 




 He lives there. That doesn't make it his. If he drives your car it's not suddenly his. 




 No, it isn't. She doesn't pay the rent/mortgage or the bills. She isn't responsible for her or anyone else's wellbeing.  




 You mean if she had "done the decent thing" and not had sex in her father's house this wouldn't have happened? 




 No, a guy calling someone a predator for being in his own house when his child was having sex is a weirdo. 




 In HIS house. She is 16, it's his house and he is free to stay. He wasn't in the room or anything. I hope you don't have children because you seem like an absolute weirdo. 




 Lesbian here; I prefer my wife and I to use different stuff. I like when she smells different than me. 




 This is sort of... wrong... buuuut I'll bite. Subarus are lesbian cars. 




 She reddited too. That's pretty sad... 




 No. He's teasing his kid. 




 20 year old lesbian here. Outright tell her. Tell her gay, straight, doesn't matter to you. Tell her you love her unconditionally.  




 Oh god I just realized how horrifying it is that I reddited a ton the night of my wedding. 




 Pizza makes me break out :( 

But I eat it anyway so I guess I'm more of a skincare social user. 









 Oh snap. This is why I shouldn't comment before I'm actually awake. 




 Mine hasn't been coming but last month my mom was diagnosed with non alcohol related cirrhosis. When she told me it came. 




 My period has been super irregular for the last year and a balf. Last week, it decided only after 22 days since the previous one, that it was coming. I woke up with a brand new sheet destroyed and apparently my sleep self was unhappy with the moisture because I had ripped the sheet up and *tucked it into my crotch*. I had been sleeping naked.  




 I'm transmasculine/genderqueer and currently identify as a lesbian. I'm married to a beautiful woman who, despite being 100% certain that she is gay, completely supports me and recognizes that top surgery is an inevitability and is fine with that. I know I will probably transition one day, if I can be sure it means not losing my family, but I know my wife will continue to identify as a lesbian and that is fine by me. Other transguys I know have dated girls that identify as lesbians and I have seen some relationships go from lesbian to straight. 

Have any of you guys had relationships like this? Would any of you begin a relationship with a woman who identified as a lesbian? I'm not looking for validation; I'm trying to start a conversation. 




 As many fuck ups, this happened roughly 10 years ago. I was about 10 and needed to poop. It was midsummer and, living in the Poconos (Northeast Pennsylvania) it was quite hot out. At this time, there was no air conditioning in our house, so windows were all open. Knowing this was going to be a long poop, I decided to find a means of entertaining myself. 

The previous Christmas, my Grammy had gotten me and my brother a kid size accordian to share. We had barely touched it. I figured this was as good a time as any, so I made sure it would make sound, and headed to the bathroom.

I sat down and began trying different notes. I've always been pretty good with music; singing in church since age 3, clarinet since 8, so I could recognize notes by sound pretty easily. I figured out the beginning of the song and played it a few times while trying to figure out the next part.

It was going spectacularly and I was so excited to be able to share my learnings with my family. I went down stairs after I was done, and went out on the front porch to tell my parents the news.

I was greeted by my parents, brother, and several neighbors singing the song to me and then asked how my trip to the bathroom went. 

TL;DR London Bridge was falling down and embarrassment was falling up. 









 We have been married for three months, together four and a half years. Before we got married, sex was roughly weekly. On our wedding night, she fell asleep in the middle of it. We had sex several times the first week and then it plummeted. I don't think we had sex at all I'm February and have once this month, where it was all me touching her and I barely got kissed. She offers to take care of me but I'm not even allowed to touch her breasts. I want to make love to my wife. I constantly feel rejected and unattractive. I love her and want to be with her but I hate feeling like this. 




 For almost a year, I have been paying for the unlimited card with bring your own phone. My phone is a red LG phone with a slide out keyboard. It's not a smart phone. When I had AT T the Internet use was disabled because it wasn't a part of the plan and we didn't want any upcharges. I don't know how to turn it back on and it's really inconvenient because I can't get picture messages. How can I turn it back on? If this isn't the right place I'm sorry but I didn't know where else to look. 














 My wife and I have recently realized that a large majority of lesbian sex media is centered around small, athletic bodies. Obviously not all lesbians are small, athletic people. What are your choice ways of making love to your lady, if one or both of you don't fit that stereotype? 




 I live in a semi-rural area. Girls get pregnant way too young here all the time. It's not Bible Belt area though, so it's not really a big deal to most people. It's a big deal to me, though. I'm going to college so I can one day support my family doing something that I love and am passionate about. I'm married to my partner, whom I've been with for four and a half years. All I want is a baby, but we can't have one because we are only 20 with no real way to afford one. Her sister, who is 18, is due in April and is getting everything handed to her for it. When we were 200 dollars short on rent because my job didn't pay me, they told us they knew this would happen and we were stupid to move out. But here we are, working hard at our goals, not having the one thing I really want, and it doesn't seem to do any good! We had no transportation for the last six weeks so we are yet another semester behind due to having to withdraw. We moved back in with my parents to save up toward our goals, but it doesn't matter because all of our money goes to household stuff anyway! I feel like I will never be able to have a family, which is all that I want. I know it's not a good time, and I know that we can't afford it and don't have enough room for a baby, but it's the only thing I want and it sucks that I feel punished for doing what's right. 

TL;DR: I want a child and can't have one because I can't afford it, but other people get to screw up and have just that. 




 I'm just so disappointed. I live about 80 miles from the city and have all my life, and last year was my first time there at all and at a pride event bigger than four stands in a park. I feel so bad for her, but it really sucks we don't get to march. 




 (Posted for my brother's girlfriend) So my boyfriend and I decided to take my three dogs to PetSmart to get them new stuff. While he was doing something in the car, I loaded the three of them into a shopping cart together. It was cold and I was tired of waiting for him, so I set off toward the store. I was a bit annoyed that he was taking so long, so, when he began yelling my name as I walked into the store with my cart load of dogs, I ignored him. This was where I fucked up. I turned around to see him yelling and continued into the store. That's when I saw the phones and people dressed in blue and yellow. I brought a cart full of dogs into Best Buy, the store next to PetSmart.

TL;DR: my boyfriend tried so save me from bringing my three dogs into Best Buy and failed. 




 I have no idea when the last time I posted in this sub was but I was banned several days ago. Mods will not answer me, so I tried to ask on the ask sub, and I am banned there, too. I asked in modmail there, and all I got was a message that if I continue to message modmail, I'll be reported for modmail disruption. I responded that I needed an answer and I'm more than willing to stop messaging modmail when I get one. No response after that. I wouldn't care but it's the sub about a view I hold very strongly and I don't understand how I could be banned. It's really unfair and I just want to know why it happened. 




 My friend wants to get one next week. He's looking for black skin tone, stp and sex capable. He wants it circumcised and durable. Any recommendations of products you guys have used and liked? 














 He is painting it black and gray, from yellow, which my mom picked out 30 years ago. I'm not contesting that it needed paint long ago, but he is making it awful. He didn't bother to tape the ceiling, which he doesn't plan to paint, the trim is hideous with both black and gray on it because he taped it poorly and it just looks awful. He painted cabinets multiple colors and poorly at that without asking first. He has stuff all over and is taking a very long time to finish. Each night, and whenever he isn't painting, he puts his painting supplies in the bathtub so no one can bathe. You have to go through the kitchen to turn the heat on, and we live in the north east. My mom has a ton of medical problems and needs to have access to food, heat, and the bathroom. She doesn't want to say anything because she is grateful he is trying to help, but he is really causing problems.

TL;DR: my brother is trying to help but is making a bigger problem. 




 I know you have to be clean for something like a year, but wouldn't it make more sense to put nonalcoholics ahead on the list since they didn't make themselves sick? I'm not asking for a change my view, I just want to know why they qualify for it. 









 She is my best friend and my mom. She's wonderful. She was a foster and adoptive and biological mother and she took in my now wife when we were 17 and her mother through her out. She's my hero. And today she was diagnosed with non-alcohol related cirrhosis. She actually actively decided not to be an alcoholic as her father was one. Please, just pray for her. I'm so destroyed right now. I'm only 20. I'm not ready for this at all.
