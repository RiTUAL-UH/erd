 Alright, I knew this much, but thanks for replying! 




 You should go back, because it is as good as you remember, I promise you.

Why does the download speed fluctuate in the pattern it does? I don't know much about the way internet magic works, but you can explain it in full science if it is easiest for you and I'll google the words I don't understand.

Edit: To be clear, that last line was a joke. I'm sure I'll understand however you explain it. Thanks for the replies so far!

Final Edit: Among the other good replies, 3brushie answered my question completely. I'd link to his comment, but not only do I not know how to do it the Reddit way, but it's also only about 10 inches down the page. Thanks askscience, I hope we can do this again sometime. 




 What are the chances that we in America won't get the Freedom edition?  It's announced in Europe and Asia, but we have no word of it coming to America. With only a few months to go before the release, it seems like the winners of the American Revolution won't get the game based on the American Revolution. What do you guys think? 




 Ocdscale and mmer, thanks, that is good to know. That does make a big difference in how I feel about it. I'll be turning that on as soon as I play next for sure 




 Again, ice armor and crystal skin are very different, but I see what you're saying. I've tried all of these combos, just can't find one that *really* works 




 I thought of that, and I tried the bubble, but the spear throwers' spears go over half way through the bubble before they are slowed, which made my head explode. Losing wave of force for the slightly useful bubble wasn't worth it. More signs point to elective mode 




 Same here, no worries 




 On that note, gold goes fast in the auction house. Good places to farm? 




 I use the ice armor ability that freezes enemies when they swing at me and slows them when they're near. Crystal skin is too precious to replace with that ice aoe, so elective mode it is? 




 Hahaha, actually it absorbs near 3000... If I didn't make this clear, I'm not new to gaming, but I am new to this game style. I'm not good at building characters based on armor stats :/ 




  The "normal" mode as you call it 

I thought that's what the first difficulty is called. Am I wrong?
 




 Like I said, I don't have my pc near me otherwise I would. I have around 230 intelligence and 1500 health I believe. About 126 arcane power. I generally two shot the standard enemies of the beginning of act 3 with arcane orb, but when I run out of arcane power its impossible to kite because I cant move fast enough to dodge attacks 




 So I realize I'm probably pretty terrible at this game, but its very tough for me not to die as a wizard on act 3 in *normal* difficulty. I use ice armor, crystal skin, wave of force, spectral blade, and arcane orb.


First off, I don't like the idea of elective mode. I think you should play the game as it was originally intended to be played. Am I just going to have to get over that?


Second, any strategies for me as a noob for surviving? The spear throwers, demons who stick they're arms in the ground, and fireball spitting bat things kill me pretty fast, because I can't move away fast enough to not get hit. Any advice would be awesome!


Btw, I believe I'm level 24, (away from my pc right now) and I don't play often because I'm more of a console gamer. Help me get back into diablo!


Edit: Thanks so far for all the helpful tips. It looks like I need to go ahead and buy auction house items (something I was against) and use elective mode (something else I was against). Ill give these a try 




 I'm friends with a lot of my brother's friends on Facebook, and this is what I have to put up with for being polite. Sadly I don't know them so I can't tell them off for being stupid. 









 Haven't found/been able to create an item with life absorption yet, but I'll keep that in mind. And I haven't been using stun, but I suppose you're right. I'm just afraid it won't affect a large boss like the Skeleton King. I don't have a templar yet but I'll use him when I get him. Thanks for the advice so far. Sounds like I need to make a *little* bit more progress until I'm in the clear. 




 I've been playing as a monk, but never playing alone. Fighting everything is easy. Now that I'm trying to play a bit of the game solo, it's not as easy. I started a new character as a barbarian, and while it is easy, I'm still afraid I'm not doing it right. My only question is, how do I fight a boss where it's 1v1, when I have to get up close and hammer him? Do I just have to rely on healing potions? I'm about level 9 and getting close to fighting the skeleton king. Any advice would be great! 




 Alright, sounds good, and thanks again. I like speed fighters like ezio auditore or sora in final form, but the wizard's skill pool looks so diverse and exciting. I'm sure any class will cater to a different taste of mine though 




 Thanks everyone for the replies, especially fuzzybootz. I figured Diablo wouldn't have VOIP, but it sounds like his computer will be fine. He bought it about a month ago, but it's a low level g7. It has a quad core processor at 1.5 GHz, and his graphics card is an AMD Radeon HD 6520g. My small amount of knowledge tells me he will be fine, but I've never actually ran a weak computer, as I've only owned the one I built specifically for being awesome.

Another question if you don't mind:

* On classes... I don't want to match my friends, and one is sure he will be a wizard. I like the monk if I can't play Wizard, but he looks like he can be boring. What do you guys *think* I should play as, since I know no one has played these specific classes yet?

(More background, I play a mace and shield wielding Nord and a dual-wielding Argonian assassin on my PS3, and I played a High Elf mage on PC and a healer for a month on WoW. So I pretty much like any class so far.) 




 Hey everyone, I'm new to r/Diablo, Diablo in general, and really Reddit in general, and I was hoping you of the community could give me some pointers. I would have been eight when Diablo 2 came out, so my parents never let me play it. Now that I can make my own adult choices, I'm picking up Diablo 3.

My questions:

* What quick info should I know about the lore of Diablo?

* What voice communication system do we use?

I like Skype, but I'd prefer an in game system if there is one, so my friend's internet/processor aren't affected.

* Does Diablo demand much on lowest settings?

My computer will run Crysis on max, so I'm not worried, but my buddy's laptop isn't very powerful. I just want to make sure if he has to use Skype, his processor won't be too bogged down even with Diablo at it's least. He is also afraid it won't run it. Our fingers are crossed.

* Will this game be worth it for me?

I know you are all Diablo fanatics, being that you're here, but I hate wasting money, having so little of it and all. I play Battlefield 3 religiously, Skyrim just slightly less, and I own every Pokemon game (that's just to brag, not to show my gaming style). Played WoW for a free month, liked it, but couldn't afford the subscription.

Thanks in advance for any good replies. I want to be ready in exactly 12 hours. haha

Edit: Formatting! Thanks fuzzybootz! 




 That probability assumes 100% of redditors view the material. The 90,000 difference would come from that smaller percentage of users who don't click every link. 




 This is legit miss. I just moved into an apartment two miles from this target, saw it one night and thought to do just this. If you really want proof I could probably get it for the op by tomorrow! Haha 




 I actually translated the card in full once back in the day. It's not gibberish. The letters repeat in a way that you can use the fact that you know mew's name to decipher it. Everyone try it! 




 Part of Jesus's message was revoking the false-preaching made by the Pharisees at that time. Man had created a right-and-wrong separate from what God initially told them. The religious leaders at the time (not much unlike Catholic priests today) were far from what God was about, and Jesus came to abolish that false-Church. When the description refers to "the differences between Jesus and false religion," it isn't saying Christianity (the Jesus part) is better than other religions, it is referring to Jesus calling out, so to speak, the Pharisees on their falsehoods. They put themselves in places of "God-appointed" power, which was false. 

The definition of religion is what is becoming confused here. And when he says he loves the church, he is saying he loves the idea of what church is supposed to stand for, like unity through faith, or allowing anyone in (Jesus was around the "bad" people more than the "good"). Church in our time has again fallen into a man-made invention, interpreting the Bible in such a way that says we should be against gay rights, etc. Christianity is the following of Christ, but the Christianity he is calling religion is the term man gave to the religion they follow, which has fallen away from the path that leads towards Jesus.

tl;dr - Definitions are getting mixed up, and mixed together. Be careful of that.

IAmA Christian Scientist, but I'm no theologian. This is how I interpreted the video myself. I'm not claiming that I'm right, since I'm obviously quoting the Bible, a book most of you believe is nonsense. This is the logic that makes sense to me. If I said something that doesn't make sense please pick it apart. I'm new to reddit and I'm trying to find welcome here in /r/atheism even with the beliefs I hold.

 And in that respect, I think we should realize that the devs do have a vision for the game, and, because they opened up a suggestions section on their website's forum, that they would probably love suggestions. And surely they can sort through the good and bad ones. Trust me, I've read almost every suggestion, and many are too much; they'll see it the same. 




 I may be the only one who feels this way, but this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvxS_bJ0yOU by Frederic Chopin is how I imagined the "Title Screen," with, say, an early sunrise, or sunset are shown as it pans across the islands. If you're talking menu, as in the music that pops up whenever you pull up the menu, it would have to be fast and noticeable like everyone is saying, because the menus probably won't spend too much time on screen. 
























 As an average man who has been crushed by his single cat being hit by a car, I can attest to this. 




 While your *science* is right, you left out the main ingredient to pegasi, dragons, and large beards: magic. 




 Yeah, I generally use it for CQB, but I like how it can handle targets at range effectively if you know what you're doing. The P90 and MP7 and worthless past anything other than buildings, otherwise I'd be using the MP7 everywhere. 




 SEAL Team 7 has a clan server up. When we are in, we keep it in good condition 




 Oh ok, forgot that variable. Thanks for making it known 




 First of all, llama and infectios, your posts are not helpful and annoyingly pointless to the post, please read the reddiquette.

In regards to the post, I think the beacon would be overpowered if everyone could spawn on it. Imagine if all 12 soldiers or even 32 spawned on it at once. It would be extreme mayhem. The idea would be cool, helpful, and useful, but way too powerful. They would have to put a security measure on it, like a half second or full second spawn delay between each spawn if they made this possible. 




 It released the 4th with premium in the US. Where are you located?



Edit: they were unplayable from a bug for like a day or two however 




 I suggest you buy it for xbox. Comparing pc to console is like comparing apples to oranges, simply uncomparable. That being said, buy a good gaming pc later. premium is more worth it now than it will be as more dlc releases, but pc gaming can be more fun. Its really up to you. 


Tl;dr - Buy premium now on xbox, then pc later down the road for other gaming frontiers 




 He mentioned jets, but his post mostly concerned helicopters. You only have rockets in a helo if you're an AA pilot, so we need pods to do something. Read the post better next time before you make a fool of yourself 




 I was about to post a thread there, then thought, there are more interactive andy's on BL then intelligent people, so I came here haha 




 My main gun is the PDW-R, and I use it on medic or support mainly because I'm pretty bad with rifles and completely trash with LMGs. I'm great with carbines and snipers, otherwise id use it their too.  




 Yeah I saw that text shrink as well. He literally bumps his troll posts if they're stagnant for an hour to get the responses coming. Its so sad. 




 Yeah, I saw the troll post. Of course his kdr and skill are high, he hides in the back while getting mav kills only. No deaths means no drop in skill.  




 The last 30 seconds were most gripping, as I expected the soldier we were following to get knifed by the recon near the end, so they could share their remorse.  




 Yeah, this. I tried to record some footage back in the alpha so I could give feedback, but my super powerful pc was incapable of playing and recording simultaneously.  




 I was exaggerating, but 3 or 4 is less than 6 to 11. It must have just been the very few times I was playing that it happened 




 It only takes like a single bullet to kill people on hardcore lol I think the thing that turned me off to it was the stupid blueberries not realizing that there is friendly fire, so I die from my own soldiers constantly. Super off putting 




 I never really play hardcore. Idk why. It's not like it's too difficult, it's just less fun for me. You enjoy it more?

 Never used the extinguisher, but that's because I thought it could only be used once. Is it pretty useful now? 




 Surviving within an inch of life after an epic slaughter... These are battlefield moments that I play for 




 These are the moments when you feel good, like you're a true, skilled soldier. Good feel 




 Are you in my clan? We feel this way everyday haha 




 After playing close quarters with conquest domination, capping a regular conquest flag feels like the microwave minute from hell. I know the feeling 




 I would like to hear any of your more unusual moments where your first reaction drenched you in the fear that you would soon meet your demise, but your valorous Battlefieldian mindset brought you through to victory. Here's mine:

Today I was capturing point Bravo on Caspian Border, when a large tree on the C side of the capture point was knocked down somehow. The tree pinned my soldier so I could run around between the branches, but I was trapped within them until it disappeared. In all of my long hours since the game released in October, this has never happened to me. Meanwhile, through the brush, I witnessed a jeep with two men drive up, and a third soft target following close behind. I quickly threw on my big boy pants, locked and loaded, and screamed my war cry as I fired on the jeep's driver first, killing him, then his gunner, with a few (probably lucky) shots. The third man discovered my hideout but I used my prison to my advantage, using the branches as a shield, successfully luring him one way so that I could shoot him in the back and rain victorious, just prior to the tree vanishing. I successfully held Bravo while hiding in what I had assumed would be my grave, and now I want to hear your stories. Anything is fine, but preferably the strange. 




 Thank you, this sufficiently answers my query, and it makes perfect sense. I doubt uTorrent cares enough, or is even capable of showing a more defined graph, one which would support to what you are referring. Good enough for me.  




 I can watch the graph update every second. Does it calculate it in reference to the prior speed? Or through some other equation? If what you're saying is true then the graph it supplies me while it's downloading the torrent is a farse, and it's not showing me real speed data.

The way I'm making sense of what you're saying, is that when the transmissions are interrupted, the speeds decelerate, which is why they fall, until they can connect to another peer, where they begin to lift again? Let me know if this is a completely false assumption. 




 The last sentence sort of answers my question. I suppose that make sense. Dropping and picking up peers would appear to cause that, except the slopes are pretty defined over proper intervals, so there should be more to it than that. 
























 Longest headshot or longest headshot on a chopper pilot? 




 I live in an apartment, alone, in wichita, ks, and if I made even $20,000 a year it would cover everything for me. That would include car, insurance, tuition, rent, food (the highest cost for someone with my appetite), internet, electricity, and phone. Anything more than that and I could freely spend it on anything. Granted my apartment may be a bit drab to some, and I don't drink, and I don't need fancy things to be happy. I'm still shooting for ~100k for my career salary, but that's for financial security. 




 Your trolling is successful! I don't even play the game, and I still hate you. Keep up the good work! 




 My apologies, I don't know the rules to reddit, and I'm on my my phone always so I can't read them. What does it matter anyway?  




 Your fun fact made me sad. That shouldn't be a fun fact.. 




 Was this a parody/joke they were doing for the class? Or were they serious? 




 Fun fact: The particles that we *smell* are not the same as the actual particles. So smelling poop does not mean there is poop floating in your nose. Reddit taught me that! 




 Best way to do it is by uploading your image to imgur.com, which is in itself very simple, then paste that link 




 I'm level 30 and I play *lite* hours, on regular servers. If you play those 1750 ticket metros even 3 or 4 times a week, you'll easily be up there pretty fast, assuming you have some sort of skill.  




 Like if it rolled on its back and I wanted to tickle its belly, it would slice the flesh off my fore arms. I see.. 




 Well I'd have a conversation. Haha that was my problem. I was always as friendly as I could be, and I was tipped generously for it, but when you wonder why you don't have your drinks yet, it's because you told me the story about how you became the prince of bel air, and I just can't be in two places at once. You just don't tell the customer to their face that you don't have time to talk to them. 




 Well that is unfortunate. I would really like a lion cub or two to spruce up the apartment, but I'm definitely not trained to handle that. Thanks for the reply! 




 I saw that post with the picture of the lion cub in the front seat of taco bell guy's car, and had this question. If I raised my own lion cub from birth to adulthood, is it DNA-wired to be a predator? Would it eat birds and my neighbors cats and eventually my annoying neighbors when it is an adult? Or would it only act as I trained it, so it could just be my really frightening looking house cat? 




 This will sound weird, but please don't try to be my friend if the restaurant is full. I usually had five tables minimum, and if you literally talk to me for five minutes about my life or yours, that's great, but it throws off my entire night, because I keep a flawless routine. Come in later when we are slow if you want my life story, that's when I'm glad to give it 




 That's entirely personal. People not stacking plates drove me absolutely insane when I was a waiter. The conglomeration of trash and plates spread over the table always took longer to clean then whatever the kind customer did for me. I think it's better for the server to be more flexible in handling what is given to them. 




 To all current or future Subway employees:

*Coat* the bread rolls in herbs, don't just dip one side in, they're so much better that way.

Proof to about 13", they shrink when they bake.

Always wipe excess cheese off the baking forms, it'll save *literally* hours of cleaning later

Last, bake them so that they're light brown, still visibly green from the herbs, and the cheese isn't burnt. You all suck at this part a lot and the bread tastes awful because of it.

I was a Sandwich Artist at Subway, and I put the art in artist. 




 This was the answer I was looking for. I figured it was just a mirror of some sort, but I didn't give it a close look, and it looked completely real. Thanks for this.

Edit: Look at the base of the flag for example. How is that being done? That's not a mirrored image, and I don't see any other part of the image that it could have been taken from. 




 I've never used photoshop before in my life, and I'm 20 years old. I saw [this gif](http://arixev.deviantart.com/art/Diablo-3-Act-2-Wallpaper-How-i-made-it-307916030) today and thought, how is this even happening? Do pictures like the character loading screen have multiple layers, so that you can crop out the character's layer and the background image will exist beyond it? I know photoshop uses layering and other magic like that, but I need more explanation. 




 I get it! The clown is deaf! Right?? Guys? 




 Mine forgets where the AC vents are everyday, and when she finally finds them again she gets super excited and decides that she is the only one allowed to have air conditioning after that. 




 Pretty much any day I would open the freezer door when I first got my husky, she would sit in it at the bottom just like this. She still tries and she is massive 




 It's the tinfoil-hat comments that make me realize I have no idea what is going on 80% of the time here on Reddit.  




 http://imgur.com/f0B01

You have negative downvotes, while people usually have positive downvotes.  




 Excited, excited, EXCITED.

Then you let me down. I'm gonna go with, you say it means nothing so I don't investigate more, and uncover a truth you don't want me to. This isn't over. 




 I'm new to reddit and the RES as well, but why does your karma say (2|-1)? Is that not the same as (3|0)? What is happening? 




 I want to downvote you for trying to do something heinous, but I also want to upvote you for possibly actually believing that you would appreciate that more than me.

And, kittensngravy, that would be awesome, but I cannot ask that of you. Thank you anyway!
