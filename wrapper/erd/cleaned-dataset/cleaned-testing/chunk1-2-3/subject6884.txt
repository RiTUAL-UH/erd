 So.....Is Barack Obama the first Black Man to beat a white woman and not serve time for it? 




 I'd start the date by praising her about her job, The people who answer those phones are helping to save lives dude! 




 So that's why Obama's sending 30,000 troops over to Afghanistan! Training!

 Nothing you are doing wrong, its the way internet is managed in china(fire-walled). Data coming in and out of datacenters in China gets bottlenecked thus slowing down the download speed quite considerably! This coupled with the fact that the fastest speeds you can get in Beijing is 2meg multiplied by the vast amount of people using the internet in Beijing equals a piss poor download speed!  









 Sorry, That Burberry cap still looks fake to me!

 France is a country with a long history of allowing Nazis to set up puppet governments. But the rest of their history is shameful,The French under Napoleon III presented the United States with the Statue of Liberty -- an intended trojan horse ambush gone wrong. The vast majority of French men are sex addicts, in the closet and/or champagne socialists. The most common thing a frenchman will say during his life is "what proof do you have that i am full of shit"? France is most famous for enacting legislation banning women from shaving their armpits, which was then enthusiastically imported by the horrifyingly hirsute Italians. 









 Its called Pinning Tabs. if you right click a tab then Pin tab, it will make it smaller and remove the x so its harder to close, can be quite usefull, the feature may only be in the beta builds tho

 Thanks for all the great responses guys. I think setting up my own business would be a bit too extreme for me. I think the non-immigrant "b" approach with the visa runs sounds like the best idea. Maybe getting a TEFL before I go out is an idea. Or I could work illegally??  




 Hi guys my girlfriend has recently been given a conservation job in Thailand. I am hoping to join her maybe for as much as a year. I would like to travel a bit as well as some local employment to keep funds going. I've looked into visa's and work permits but it seems a little confusing and would like a little advise on it. I am a British citizen.

 There is a significant increase in sound quality when you switch up. I guarantee!
