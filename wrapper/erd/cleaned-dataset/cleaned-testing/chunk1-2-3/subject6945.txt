 I'll swap you for my girlfriend...  




 *facepalm* 




 I change my tampon 




 yep, I can cross Canada off my places to visit list... 




 if you come to me and make this, I will pay you any amount of money. 




 such a sad day  




 7/11 




 nope, that's just a severe case of gingivitis. 




 I Have not played this game in years!!! I completed about 3/4 of the game before a douchebag friend scratched the fuck out of it :(  




 karma whoreing your own son... parenting done right  




 I pay $5.99 for a haircut to have the hairdressers boobs rub on my head  




 I have been fooled by that many times  




 quit work, problem solved  
























 I'm probably going to get the shit ripped through me for this, but I'm new here so cut me some slack. 

why is asking what to get a bad thing? 
I only ask because I was just about to make a post asking for some advice on some good gear and places to get it from for someone who isn't familiar with all this.  




 that's what happens when you make out with a vacuum cleaner 




 I don't want to live on this planet anymore.  




 uptokes all round to share the love!!  




 you're an idiot, that's not dave.  




 well about 6 years ago my dad got his first mobile phone, and for about 6 months he kept forgetting where the space key was so every message I would get would be one big head fuck that I would have to go through, it didn't help that my sister told him "2 typ lik dis 2 mak it shorta".  




 as the title explains I'm struggling to find a suitable FIFO job in the mining sector. 

I am a qualified fitter and machinest with a wide variety of experience, but I'm having trouble finding work in the mines. 

mainly due to the fact I'm unsure of where to start looking, Iv tried all the main job search sites but can't seem to find anything suitable or within my qualifications, most jobs Iv found have been for high up supervisor jobs and such, and seeing as Iv only been qualified for 7 months I doubt I will have any luck with a job like that. 

all I have been hearing about is this "mining boom" where so many people are getting these amazingly high paid jobs, but I can't find them! 

so if any of you have any advice on how I can get my foot in the door I would really appreciate it! :) 

 




 when I was 14, i ran into a door at full speed and knocked myself out cold while chasing a friend around his house. the last thing I remember was his mum yelling " stop running around before someone gets hurt!!!" then bam I was out. scored I nifty little scar under my eye from it.  




 fitter and machinist here! finished my apprenticeship 6 months ago and trying to make my way to the WA to toll away in the mines 




 fuck you.  




 can someone tell me how long that thing went for? I gave up after seeing the fetus and realised it wasn't goin to stop  




 proposed to my girlfriend... 




 the look on the office ladys face at work when I ran out of the toilet in a rush with my pant down to answer the phone because I thought I was the only person there.  
























 Sitting on the toilet, post sexy time, in my birthday suit, on my birthday! Can't get much better 




 that is a fucking big lathe! how long does it take to set up something that big? 




 you're never too old man! have fun and enjoy :) 




 try those little $2 shops full of completely random crap in big shopping centre's, that's where I got mine from.

 golden rule of industry: don't stick your fingers where you wouldn't stick ya dick.  




 too late 









 a bud, because that's exactly what it is.  




 I'm the same with the term "nug"  




 Well she proves smoking doesn't stunt your growth.  




 If it was not for the movie where Emma Stone dressed up like a tramp and left me with half a chubb for an hour and a half I would not get this reference.
