 That looks effing delicious. 




 When you think about the plasticity of a young child's brain, why would doctor's even risk it? 




 We could, without any doubt, feed everyone in the United States this way. All we need is some regulation to protect both people from bad food and companies from frivolous lawsuits. 




 Something about ships/boats submerged in water is really creepy to me. Especially if they're upright. 




 Does it have anything to do with the surface area of the glue, as well? Like a puddle of water will evaporate much faster than the same volume of water in a glass, all environmental factors being the same, because of larger surface area.

 Does anyone remember THIS cute little guy?

 So I'll pose the same question I always pose when I see articles like this: why don't more people just err on the side of the environment? Clearly the people really pushing the agenda against science are concerned about money. Money money money. No long-term sight. It makes me sick. 




 Protein. Diet variation. Humans are omnivorous.

If you're asking from a vegetarian/vegan perspective, I sympathize. The way animals are farmed is horrendous. 




 Nevermind. That's an anti-spam technique, apparently. Wow I'm tech saavy.

 What's the difference between jelly and jam?

You can't jelly your dick down a girl's throat.

 Sam is not human. 




 My first thought was "Saved By the Bell." 
























 I got detention once for simply roaming the hall without a pass. Mind you - there were a dozen other kids doing the same thing at the same time in the same hallway - kids that frequently got in trouble. The dick hall monitor noticed me, a straight-A student, didn't belong there, breaking the rules, and gave me detention. I said something like, "I do all my work and have never gotten in trouble for anything." He said, "I know but YOU know better." Fuck that. 




 no. 




 About a month ago I was getting ready for bed at my girlfriend's apartment when I heard her two cats making those weird purring/hunting noises in the kitchen. I was like "Oh shit, there's a mouse." My girlfriend was in her room, so I wandered into the kitchen to subtly investigate. Sure enough they had a small rodent trapped in a corner of the kitchen under an end-table. I kind of just hung out for 5 minutes until they flushed it out. One of them grabbed it in his mouth and before I could react, he shot over to the g/f's room and dropped it on the floor just outside her open door. The SECOND she looked up and saw the cat she knew what had happened (neither of us knowing if the tiny rodent was alive or dead) and screamed, "Ugghhaaahh what does he have?? What does he have??? Get it!!! Please!!" I was laughing so hard at her reaction that I kind of paused then realized, oh crap it might be alive and run into her room. But it wasn't, sadly. I stepped on the poor little mouse to make her feel better but be assured, the kitty had already killed it. 




 Good. Fuck them. 




 so cool 




 Health Care. 









 That translates to roughly 2 hours a day, every day, for almost 14 years. If that's the case then I'm an expert in staring at cleavage. Nailed it.
