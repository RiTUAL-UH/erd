 If you're using the Steam Community Market to ever value something then don't, it's near pointless. Unless you mean market like just in general, in which case, yeah you're good I guess. 




 How is violet so low? Honest question here, it's my second favourite and I've been able to sell them higher than any other sheen when I sell them on backpack.tf or tf2outpost 




 Owner of a Team Shine RL here, I used to have a DD sheen on one and a VV Festive one, I'm personally liking the TS sheen more than the other one, specifically on Blue. 









 I hope I win the Stout Shako :]

 Only premium players can get random crits.  
  
Your backpack must be more than 1 bud to get mini crits.  
  
If any of your classes have a Gibus, Pyrovision Goggles or Mann Co. Cap you cannot get Random Crits. 




 If I had 26 buds I would believe you, the actual trade was 1 scrap for my Quadwrangler.

 100 damage seems higher than normal, especially if it's been a solid 100 with no 99-101 just always 100. I used it in a pub today and it just stayed at 100 on everything. This seems like more than normal.

 Title. Seeing as the most important tier is OU, are they really over used? It seems like they're just being used now.  




 I would personally give myself max cash and buy all the PK gear I could, get some rare items; Phats, Halloween Masks etc, max my skills and do drop parties in the Falador room. I would also put some cash into the well of goodwill. 



















 Now don't get me wrong, Muselk is an amazing content creator and tf2 player, but does anyone else notice a huge spike in usage for Mad Milk Atomizer Scouts or Diamondback Spies? Normally when I see one of these I just let them do what they do, but when we have 9 of the same loadout on a team, it gets kinda mundane. His loadouts are for the most part relatively average, but people are taking them as being the undeniable best loadouts (Even though he says in his Soldier video that there is no best class) Has anyone else noticed the large amount of his sets in TF2 lately? 









 Feel free to yell (Voice)MEDIC! Because that's what I'm here for, to heal you in your darkest of times. If you're on full health, yell out to me anyway, an overheal is indispensable these days. (get it? Because a dispenser can't give you an overheal. I thought it was pretty funny.) If you're a Baby Face's Blaster Scout then I'll heal you in a couple of seconds, You're a pretty quick guy. If you picked up a health kit when I'm on low health then I'll give you a quick overheal and wait for it to come back, When I'm on fire and you're a Pyro, I don't hate you for not airblasting, you might not know how to do that, maybe you don't know it puts out a player, and I'm fine with that. But I swear to god if you wear a Lime Green or Pink loadout I will never heal you. Because Y'all look stupid. 









 Ahh, the age old question of 'Should I set people on fire or should I use a stick to hit people already on fire?'  
  
  
Please don't be mean to each other, be mean to the weapons 









 So tomorrow I can buy things off the market again, I'm thinking of getting an Aces High unusual (not gonna say what because I don't want somebody to buy it just to be a dick). I heard it was broken, can anyone confirm or deny this? 




 Please, pick up money when one of these two situations arise, the first one is when I, as a Scout, have passed away, think of it as my dying wish. The second time would be when you kill a robot really really far away from the big group of players.  
  
I know you're thinking 'But Scout, it's your job to pick up the money, and it helps you by giving you a huge health boost!'  
  
While that may be true, I cannot get all of the money all of the time, and the health gain, while being extremely beneficial to me, isn't always too important to me, by the time I have picked up $20, I will already be at around 250 hp, it doesn't hurt to stand on money, In fact, it probably feels good seeing as you can brag about how rich you are since you can walk on money and it probably feels really soft.

 Even though you can get unusuals, you're going to be [uncrating alot of junk] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwO8b9iq34) it's more worth it to buy a quicksell for 10 keys or even buy them from the community market, it's a waste of money to uncrate with the amount of unusuals you're not getting compared to how many you do get. 




 So I was in a little plane in GTA Online and some guy in a huge jet comes up to me and tries to shoot me outta the sky. I had my Kinect on and was going 'Come on man I just wanna fly' and he sounded like a 12 year old going 'NO FUCK YOU I'M GONNA KILL YOU' so I made an evasive move and flew directly up and he exploded. So I promptly yelled 'THESE ARE MY SKIES MOTHER FUCKER!! KNEEL BEFORE THE MIGHT OF THE CROP DUSTER!'

 So let's face it, the EoTL update was pretty overhyped for what we got, but why don't we look at the positive things we got from this year, I'll start by saying The Base Jumper is one of the greatest things to mess around with weather you're market gardening or rocket jumping or even just being a troll. What do you guys think were great things from this year? Some nice cosmetics? The BOOST you get from the Baby Face's Blaster? Or even just a tweak to an older weapon?

 They move like a texas rattle snake, they strike with no fear or remorse, they will never back down from a fight. These players are always destroying me, when I see a Heavy, it's game over. A Pyro? Dead. You could argue that I should just move away and flank them, but they will never. Stop. Coming. It's been an ordeal, especially when there's a Medic shoved firmly up the rectum of the Heavy. Does anyone else fear these... These, *monsters*?

I also have become a better Medic, the reason for this is that I know that only a skilled player could kill me with the Targe, it's really just about the confidence that I obtained when I got that kill.

So yeah if you could go ahead and answer a couple of these, mostly the first two, that'd be great 




 ??? 









 The rocket launcher mostly is based on splash damage, removed by the Direct Hit's stats, you need to literally get direct hits to do anything with that. The Grenade Launcher, however, is based on mostly direct hits from the pills. The shattering pills from the Loch aren't as bad as the Direct Hit's rockets that basically shatter on surfaces anyway.  
  
TL;DR, this isn't really that long so not reading it just kinda makes you lazy if I'm being honest, but pretty much the play style for Soldier changes to being direct rockets and Demo's doesn't because direct pills are his thing I guess. 




 My friend was playing some TF2, can't remember the map, I think it was ctf_well, and I joined on an alt account to start pissing him off by doing dumb things like whacking his sentry when I'm not an Engineer or building right next to him because he HATES that. So I'm doing that and then I guess I walked onto a metal spawn or something because he starts talking to me in the Skype about how a Soldier took his metal. So he picks up his dispenser and says "No. This Soldier is not using my dispenser." So I walk into him as a medic and start calling for a dispenser, he gets pissed and starts to call a vote kick on me, I plead in the chat and say it's my third game and that I'm sorry and I will try harder, I stay in, but he still wont let me use the dispenser, he picks it up every time and while that's happening I need to pretend to be on Reddit laughing at something. Eventually I stop and leave him be. Until a Pyro comes and sets everyone on fire including me. At that point I stood next to his dispenser spamming thanks while other people enjoy the heals. He picks it up and burns to death. I think it was worth it on his end.

 test_subject7026's Dead Ringer/Cloak and Dagger/Invisiwatch is now rank whatever.  
  
This has gotten me killed a few times and has helped me get kills a few times. Unless you have a Hale's Own, it's not a good idea to use a strange watch. 




 Can I have that script? I've started playing Medic and I feel like it would help greatly. 




 If you hit a dude like three times then he Dead Ringers it's believable  




 test_subject7026's Strange Dead Ringer has ranked up!  
  
Screw you, Valve, now everybody knows I'm a Dead Ringing bastard.  
  
If you have a Strange Dead Ringer, I'd highly recommend that you do some strange leveling for that baby. I sold mine because of it getting me killed two times.  
  
EDIT: Ok so I made a mistake in saying comp because apparently everyone knows if there's a Dead Ringer in pubs, but my point still stands for the other watches. 




 Spy is a soft counter to everything in this game, his sappers only break your guns if you're not near them or if you're dead. If you're dead then Soldiers and Demos can take it out anyway, and they can kill you easier than a Spy.  
  
I'm speaking from past experience by the way. I've hardly ever had trouble from spies. 




 I do it when I play CS:GO sometimes :] 




 I'll do my part and tell you all of my binds from f1 - f9  
  
scout is noob class he runs too fast  
soldier is noob class just shoot feet get kills  
pyro is noob class just wm1 get kills  
  
demo is noob class m1m2m1m2  
heavy is noob class click and hold for bullets  
engineer is noob class just hit sentry get kills  
  
medic is noob class don't even kill anyone  
sniper is noob class just click on heads get kills  
spy is noob class no explanation necessary  




 Can you pop with the Overdose out? Taking out the xbow is only for when you need a burst of hp you can't do with the Medigun or are at a distance. 




 Spy is removed, Spy Mains are pissed, everyone else is happy. 




 That was the intention. There's a reason I have this account. 




 So I was chilling out in Foundry having a good time when out of nowhere a bullet goes through my head and I'm like "Damn that was a good shot." And then I see who did it and go "That's probably a hacker." I came to this conclusion when I saw the Gibus. I also noticed that he was about 3,000,000 lightyears away from me when it happened, so I spectate him and I see some Sniper gameplay, now I'm gonna admit now that I like hackers. Kinda. I like seeing what they do and how proud they are of it, it's just funny to see the stuff they do sometimes, but being the good guy I am I told the server and the guy says "Nah it was just luck." to which I replied "I know what cheats look like, I know what it looks like to shoot far away from a dude and get a headshot." and he goes on his merry way chanting "Whatever bro".  
  
So we're on Coldfront now, my hands are freezing, my coffee is countering that. And then from across the map like some Robin Hood bullpoop an arrow goes directly into my soul, reaping me of all the enjoyment I had. Now others are starting to talk about it. Things are getting so heated that the snow is melting, I decide to take a few seconds to message a good friend of mine named [Max] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh1Vo6mLv0g) asking him how he feels about [hackers who deny it when it's obvious] (http://i.imgur.com/eBvudfa.png)  
  
The guy starts to get nervous at this point, almost as if I've spoken to his parents about his poor grades at school. He starts a votekick on me which fails with a final score of 2:14, he tells me that "People hack every day, get over it" and he promptly gets kicked in the nuts by everyone on the server.  
  
So anyway, what are your opinions on the Baby Face's Blaster? Do you think it's OP or just a Side Grade? 




 I like your name. That's all. I like your name.

 That is the reason I lose 20% of my 5cp matches, I want to change to Spy and sap the nest, I want to sap the 6 Engineers, but we already have 3 Spies. It's so much easier to play the game when the Spies have a functioning mouse. 




 As a vegan, these kinds of people make me want to drink a coffee and eat a steak with a side of eggs. Also I'd have a can of pepsi because that is a great drink. 




 I am known to lie from time to time, but when it comes to hats I'm an honest man :] 




 Exactly, which makes me think he got it from somebody else for some reason. I just have a strange feeling he did. They go for like 4 extra keys if they have any spec kit on backpack.tf but basic ones don't add any value really so buying one with it just seems likely. 




 Knowing is half the battle  
  
^^^^^^^^^^GI ^^^^^^^^^^JOE 




 Granary Mid. I love Granary as a whole, but in MGE if you want to fight me you aren't going to if you want to fight in Granary Mid, I just don't like it. 




 It's got basic killstreak which makes me think otherwise, I don't know why, it just does.

 Dude I'm the leader of the Lucky Shot Hot Shots, the reason is that I have an unusual Lucky Shot with, wait for it, Stormy Storm! 




 And my bow 




 The worst part is that I forgot why I reset and I played some Mannpower and long story shot I have 500 points as Spy. 




 Ruined my high score loading menu stats thing. I reset it because I was pretty mad. I had 400 points as Soldier, I know I'm good and all but I'm not *that* good. 




 /s. 




 Strange Levels are a direct rip off from Dota 2, proof being that they count things.  
  
That's what my "Inscribed Amulet Gloves of Whatever" do right? Count things and rank up? idk I never played Dota. 




 How would those even work though? 




 I also kinda thought it was ping because I don't know about that nerd stuff :] 




 Lenny faces make someone a 4channer? I better inform all those pink Snipers! 




 They probably care about this one because Wayne is #6 on backpack.tf and d0 is #50, two rich backpacks will be looked at over the thousand poor ones, I'm afraid. 




 I'm sure there will be a lobby kind of system like MvM, so playing as a team seems more than likely. :] 




 If you're on a gambling website and get salty over losing something you've got issues. 




 I'm not even good  
  
I agree. 









 It sucks though because they find the delete button and then nobody else can know of such joys!  




 Unlikeable? He switches from a Godly Person to literally Hitler on a dime! 




 That crew has so much money made so often that doing this and basically ruining all their credibility would be horrible for them. 




 You can survive three without an overheal. I do it all the time. 




 This was way too long for me to read, and I'll probably read it later, but the one thing I want to say is that you can live three stickies from jumping. :] 




 Probably something along the lines of "Somebody really wasted $3000 on a livestreamer? What a fucking loser."  
  
 




 I like the speed boost every now and again. It's also what I use in the actual game, I use MGE for practising and improving, I'm not going to use something I don't use in the normal game in MGE.

Mostly for 1v1s but you can do a 2v2 basketball thing 




 They are way way better, which is why I don't understand the dude calling it broken, I might add that I was on Granary Mid, a small map where you can't hide and regen. 




 Sorry I phrased the thing a bit wrong, I meant you can do more depending on the situation, the situation being that the rockets are aimed around the feet and the shotgun is aimed around the chest, I've seen ~100 damage a couple times, and the rocket launcher is a very splash based weapon most of the time, the splash damage does around 80.  
  
  
The 2 hp per second saved me like twice during the fight, and half of his kills were with the Shotgun anyway. 




 Imagine someone yelling at a Pyro "THIS MEAT IS SO RARE BOBSPLOSION WOULD BUY IT!" 




 I personally love the thing (sorry /r/bisonmasterrace) but every now and again on MGE I'll get told that it "ruins MGE" and that the regen is super broken.  
  
I can see how on it's own it gives an advantage, but when they're using a Shotgun I don't see an advantage for me, they have a gun that can do more than the Rocket Launcher and think that the 2 hp per second is broken.  
  
What are your opinions on the Magic Conch? 




 I would but the guy who gave me them wants to only make profit 




 Basically, I told my friend that I'd sell his whole inventory for pure and get him exactly what he wants, he game me *150* crates. One hundred and fifty. I can't find any website that will buy them in bulk, do you guys know any sites or people that will?  
  
[This is my inventory right now. Crate city] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLoak/inventory/#440) 




 Fool I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to the person being all high and mighty, I also looked at their post history, [The first post they have on /r/TheButton was 10 days ago] (http://i.imgur.com/4YsbR29.png) which shows that they most likely did not arrive on day one. 




 /u/trollabot MommyNurse2012 









 I hide mine because I am an enigma, wrapped in a mystery, I will tell anyone who asks that I did infact press the button, anybody who wants to know can know that I pressed at 60, and that doesn't make me dirty, that makes me early, I've likely been here longer than you have you dirty grey. 




 I'm jealous of all of them, mostly the Engineer. 




 You're like the kid who sits in the back of the class just to say something to prove the teacher wrong. 




 I see what you're getting at, but potentially there could always be another Burning Team Captain waiting inside that crate #4 you have sitting around, or a Sunbeams Killer Exclusive. Although it is much more likely that you would get the kritz/awp, you will 99% of the time get utter garbage. 




 I don't think a Strangifier for some weapons would be a great idea, I'm mostly saying this because a Strange Vintage would make the Stranges from earlier be less valued 




 They're too big for Mom's fridge :[ 




 Thank you for the SFM, and is that a Glengarry Bonnet I see? That was actually the second unusual I got before I cashed out and restarted. 




 [I suddenly support the idea] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GTzHd1h47o) 




 Boys, we have a traitor! 




 Too many greys are going to go for red, hey assholes! Don't press the button! Day one pressers are excusable because we didn't know what was going on, you guys know what it does. 




 Give the button the sweet release of death! 




 cunt 




 I didn't draw them but the dude who did told me the moment he gave them to me that the Heavy and Demo look like trash, he's definitely improved since he did these, I can probably get a picture of his Sniper which is actually much better. Also, who is Medli and can I kill it? 




 Do you guys want me to do this for the other 8 classes?  
  
Well probably 7, I'm not gonna list "Hudda hudda huh!"  




 Thanks for the idea. 




 I always have this fear that I will walk into it and take damage. 




 Can you remember what this particular post was? Was it a link to his soundcloud? 




 Speaking of things that include movement speed, do you ever see a BFB Scout going slow and assume it's a Spy? Because I do this way too much. 




 Ooh, dude you might want to give up on that before you get too far into it, as much as I love the idea of it, I don't think Valve would want a taunt added to the game that removes the Pyro's mask.  




 Are you the same Smithsonian that dominated like 5 people on a Sawmill game using Loch n Load? The dude who may have been you had an unusual Sober Stuntman, just wondering. 




 Be a counter to cunt a cunt 




 It sounds like the MvM spy laugh tbh 




 I don't 




 Yes! 




 I main Soldier because I have 0 skill, I just go on any KOTH map and win. It's not hard.  




 Then don't use those weapons? 




 I'd have to say the most fun weapon for me is the Liberty Launcher, combined with the gunboats you take a whopping 85% less rocket jump damage, You can take ~15 damage from 1 jump! It's so much fun to be able to use a damaging Rocket Jumper and a Direct Hit without the splash reduction!  
  
Least fun to use? I'm sorry to the people who like them, but any Sniper or Spy item annoys me and I can't find fun in them, it's such a boring way to play in my opinion, *opinion* being an important word here, I see the value of them on the team and know that they have so much power with 1 shot potential, but I hate playing as/with/against them in every way. I'm sorry I just hate them. 




 The Strange Kritz is as rare as an unusual in the latest crates, same with the AWP, they care enough to not fuck people over and also let people obtain a Kritz without opening one of the most expensive, if not *the* most expensive crates. 




 b0ss pls

 I never tried Final Fantasy VIII (That is 13, right?) but I don't think I'd like it. You don't need to play a game to know it's not your cup of tea y'know?  




 The more people that press it, the less there are to press it when it becomes like red or something, how many among your tribe are longing for red? Probably like 2. 




 I love to Market Garden, but it's kinda hard when eagles are being hunted, you catch my drift? 




 Oh man I love Battletoads! 




 It can be anything from a sneaky little Team Fortress 2 domination line or a line from very important plot related line from Solid Snake. Video Game movies and shows count too if you want

 I became a p2p at around 500 hours, I already had like 18 hats at that point from crafting drops and some trading.  
  
I didn't really need any hats from the store, just keys baby!  
  

Also you can become some weird mix of f2p and p2p by getting traded a weapon, so that's how I became f2p2p at 150 hours or whatever.
