 My grandfather has the same set as well. He actually just gave them to me, along with an old spokeshave. 




 Isn't this what you weird goth people wore along with ample amounts of chain? 




 Top left-hand corner anyone? 




 Nothing on this thread is really that creepy but this made me shit myself 




 It's already begun. My chin...it...it's gone. Tell everyone you can. Please. The dawn of the chin-snatchers is upon us. 




 Hahaha - "chin" as in chinchilla. However, I think you know that. 


Just kidding. I'm coming to steal your chin. Beware. We are coming for you. 




 I'm sorry you had to depart with your chin - that's a shame. But yes, they are extremely sociable and smart little creatures. I let mine run around an hor or two a day and give him plenty of chew toys. He seems to be happy. I've only had him for a couple months.
 




 Mine is just so fuzzy and little. Certainly not a threat to the paranormal.  




 If anyone/anything tries to do this to me, I'm screwed. I have a chinchilla 




 It pains me to read that your parents treated you like that. One of the better stories on nosleep, in my opinion. I hope to read more from you.  




 This was wonderfully written. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it; however,  this didn't actually happen,  did it? Excuse my naivety.  
























 I loved that hike. I did it twice in a day 




 I've had similar things happen to me. It's strange that you mention swimming lessons. I used to dread going to my swimming lessons when I was young (for some unknown reason). I remember a specific instance when I got into an argument with my parents because they forced me to go when I didn't want to. The phone then rang a couple minutes later saying the lesson was cancelled. As you said, these feelings passed as I grew up and became more confident.  




 Be my Ygritte? (before she dies) 




 Falllniven f1. I carry this with me all the time and it's my all-purpose, go to knife. A little pricey, but I'm probably never going to buy another knife. 




 Libra is my zodiac - I think it looks really cool. 




 That actually scared me 




 Video game. These should be made into a.video game. I would play it 




 Wow I completely forgot about this show. I used to watch it once in a while - why did I ever find it entertaining?  




 I've hiked Angel's Landing before. It was really beautiful. I really enjoyed it! 




 Mora Knives 




 I know you asked for books, but you should search for Paul Sellers' YouTube channel. He is very informative. I really enjoy watching him. 
























 Fuck that. I didn't even get 3 sentences in. I just got home from college last night. I'm on the toilet reading this with my front door open. 

Save me 




 After watching this movie I did some research about it. Some people actually believe the demon travels through pictures of the box. I read about people warning others to stop sharing the image, because even looking at it can act as a "portal" for lack of a better term. I just thought it was interesting.  




 It happens to me rather frequently. My first experience with sleep paralysis happened when I was around 6 or 7. I remember "waking up" and feeling very threatened (I apologize for the lack of detail as I was very young). As the feeling progressed, I tried calling out to my brother with whom I shared the room with. I immediately realized that my screams for help were inaudible. Soon after I tried sitting up with no avail. I was lying there helpless, mute, and temporarily paralyzed. It was one of the more frightening experiences of my life at the time. The next vivid case occurred about a year and a half ago. I was asleep, facing my girlfriend when I "woke up" again. This time my sleeping girlfriend's eyes opened slowly and her face became very dark. At this point I realized I was paralyzed again, and this was about the point where the panic set in. She then began to mumble quietly, yet aggressively in an incomprehensible manner (think of a double-voice synonymous with demons? . I felt an immense pressure on my neck as if I was begin stranged. This sensation lasted roughly 15 seconds and abrubtly ended when my paralysis ended, and my girlfriend smiled at me and rolled back over. After doing some research I found out that it happens to people who are under a lot of stress. I am currently an engineering student and know that I am always under a large amount of stress and anxiety.  









 I actually live outside of North Philly. Thanks for that 









 That made me so mad when I saw that. That guy was so sad when they shot his dog. I felt horrible. 




 I do this alllll the time! 




 I would pay to see Julian get his bird sucked by Lahey 




 Yeah if you mention Marijuana in any head shop around me (I live in the Philadelphia area) they get very upset 




 I - Kendrick Lamar. That song is so catchy
