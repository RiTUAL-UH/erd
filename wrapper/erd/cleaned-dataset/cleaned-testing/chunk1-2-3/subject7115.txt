 The voices told her it was okay to attack people because its all just for fun. 




 The only reason I like the Sith more than the Jedi is because of their ability to shoot force lightning out of their fingers. I wish I could do it. 




 She doesn't have a home. Alderaan was destroyed by the Death Star. Thanks for bringing it up...She was finally getting over it. 




 Totally. Right on. 




 Zero fucks given 




 Sounds like my typical weekend. 




 Go to bed grandma. 




 Dang. You beat me to it. 




 IT'S OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In the delicious category. 




 Serves him right. 




 I find this incredibly arousing. 




 Stupid 




 It's more funny if anything. The little girl in front row to the left looks funny.  




 Monopoly is over man. Ended on the 22nd. 




 No? It just looks like people spending time at the beach and someone snapped a picture of their friend laughing.  




 Legendary 




 This is amazing 




 I'm so sick of seeing this one. I've seen it 6 times on r/wtf 









 I feel as if I saw this last month 









 He's rather attractive. 




 When did we rename the Internet "the mall"? 




 Some men just want to watch their hair burn 




 do you get what kind of plant it is? 




 There are very few things I wouldn't do to this man. He gets me so aroused just by looking at him! 




 Thank you! 




 I caught that a few months back. I had a Disney day and watched Hercules after The Lion King and laughed my ass off. Fuck you Scar!!! 




 He's from the UK and represented Britain in the Olympics. 




 Video killed the radio star* 




 You're right. They discovered that its actually animal skin. Not human. 




 I like the altered one better 




 I would do more than that to him 




 This is the repost of reposts. I've seen this at least 5 times a week for the past two months. 




 It doesn't look like him though. I know who he is but that's not him. 




 It was just south of Arizona. They found him in a ditch shot in the head. They caught the one who took his truck and by that time they had loaded it with various weapons and tons of blow, transporting it. 




 Someone posted a picture of this guy walking around outside a couple days ago. Who is he? 




 Sleep? Not for me. Because spiders. 




 Agreed. My uncle was killed by cartel members when he was on a business trip. 




 Nicki looks so good. 




 It's definitely animal (obviously) but I can't tell what kind. It looks like a plant eater though looking at the teeth. But then again I can't for sure tell due to quality. 




 Unless there is strong, hard evidence to suggest it is in fact related to the Nazis, this is not what you think it is. I agree that it might be Masonic or depending on the age of the building, just might be coincidence if the building is older than the 1930s. 




 I see dinner 




 Anyone want to double stuff her? Anybody? No? Me either. 




 That looks like my ass. Maybe someone photoshopped some ass cheeks on this lady's tits. 




 I like the first comment. She thought she was all cool correcting the word. 




 This is so SHOCKING.   




 I can't stop laughing at the reactions of all the people behind them. 




 It looks like it's most likely the umbilical cord. 




 It's not a swastika. 




 Obviously not everyone knows it, for example this post. 




 It looks like a Pokmon. 




 I agree. It's a gap. 




 Thank you! Someone knows what that symbol really means and how the nazis perverted it. It's origins go way back and people don't know it means something completely different. 









 Is this from a movie? I feel it is and I've seen it. 




 This gif would do better in wtf 









 My pants just got shorter 




 Pretty sure I'd be arrested for public nudity because I'm not inside all day, like you. But let's just end this because I'm sick of seeing your name pop up on my inbox. Last time I'm replying to your stupidity. 




 DAT BREASTMILK 




 No. I slept. Like a normal person. Because I'm not up all night harassing people on reddit. I have a life. 




 You do too. 




 And again, I don't care. 




 You're so sweet. 




 Do you honestly think I care? Because I don't. 




 I would still shake the hand of whoever tricked me. He/She deserves a congratulations in my book. 




 I give you that, but bacon. That's all I need. 




 She still looks white. That's enough for the media to feed off of. 




 Uh, yes Houston, reading you loud and clear. It seems you don't quite understand sarcasm, over. One small joke for me, one big step over your head. 









 This is...FANTASTIC. 




 It looks like an outfit Sasha Baron Cohen wore in "Brno." 




 Reminds me of the sculptures from James and the Giant Peach that they made out of all the mashed peach. 




 I would be disappointed if I ran to get this mystical "free beer" and discovered it was just a clever way to get my attention to go inside. Then I'd just laugh and buy a beer anyway to commend them on their trickery. 




 This made me cringe. 




 It's shopped 




 It's true. Whenever pretty white girls do anything, America puts all the attention on it. Attractive white people are the news. Everyone else gets pushed aside. 




 It's not even funny. That person is dead and it's rude to make fun of dead people. 
























 I got dumped a couple of weeks ago for the first time after 8 months with my first ever boyfriend. I had never been in a relationship with anyone before, nor had I done things with a guy so he was my first everything. I even ended up giving him my virginity because I thought I was ready. I don't regret it. But I just still have a lot of emotion towards the breakup and keep trying to tell myself I'm past it but it really hurt my self esteem. I'm a bigger guy and so it was hard finding my first relationship and took a lot of time and hard work. I'm 19 and I just can't figure out how to get past it and rebuild myself. All my confidence is gone and I don't know many other gay guys to ask. Please be nice. Thanks. 









 Exactly. 




 Those feels. They hurt. 




 I upvoted because you're cute 




 The red brick road leads to death, disease, anguish and sadness. There's also cookies and milk. 




 Do I see egg clusters from flies or just puss? 




 I don't get it. Is it wtf because its the same? 




 Yummy! That hair! ;) 




 How did it happen? This makes me so sad.. 




 WHAT?!? 




 He can keep playing with those joysticks he has. I'll take the one in his shorts. 




 This is fucking hot 




 Stalin had an iconic mustache yet people still wear the style and he was worse than Hitler and killed millions more than the Nazi's did. Sadly, I admire his mustache. 




 I'm gay and I just got pregnant. I'm scared but I'm keeping it. Take that nature! 




 This is how I feel on all three dating sites I'm a member of, and in real life when I ever get any courage to try and ask anyone out. 




 He gets me all sorts of hot and bothered 




 Decomposition. You'd look like this too if we left you out somewhere to rot. 




 A woman who fucked up cooking?! This is an abomination! 




 Nothing funny about this but damn they're hot! 




 Did you think it meant January 1913? 




 I'm assuming you think that flesh colored thing right under the kangaroo is a ballsack. You're blind. It's a foot. Otherwise, what the fuck are we looking for? 




 I ain't saying he a gold digger... 




 Buddha hand. They smell fantastic. 









 So jealous! 




 Hot damn! 




 Totally a bag from a box of wine. I've done it at parties. 




 Can I marry him? 




 Dark Helmet from Spaceballs. Very nice. Love that movie. 




 Source?? Please!

 Well excuse me. I didn't mean to upset you. Gracious. 




 Does anyone else think it looks like the dog is smiling? 




 They're all along the bottom and in the background.  




 Do you really not see the maggots? They're on the reverse side. 




 Repost 




 NO CAPS LOCK
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE FAGET
NO ONE LIKES TO READ THAT MUCH 




 THIS IS MY REGULAR FUCKING WEEKDAY NIGHT FAGET 




 WHERE ARE YOUR CAPS LOCKS FAGETS

I WILL STICK MY SUSHI ROLL IN THAT FAGET 




 There is nothing significant in this photo 




 I think he's trying to get into porn or he might have already done so. Anyways, he's fucking attractive now. 




 Ahhhh, Hispanics 




 I think he likes you. With his penis. 




 I honestly thought this was a man who had put on fake boobs. 




 It actually is a legitimate photo taken during a paranormal investigation of the Amityville murder house. It was taken in the 1970s. 




 Yeah, with no explanation your picture makes absolutely no sense. But since I now know, I can say she's stupid. 




 Agreed 




 Nice makeup. It looks good...but obviously not good enough. 




 Try posting a picture of your mother. Wait. That's what this is. Never mind. 




 Could help with sex 




 I'd bang 




 How about attention whore who probably has daddy issues 




 Looks like Amanda forgot to clean out her locker. 




 Just broke up last night. I can't wait until I no longer care. 




 He looks like Wall-E. 




 It's all a matter of food distribution.  









 I did too. And I'm a man. 









 No. Too late. It's been posted quite a bit already. 




 It's a repost. Trust me. I made the same mistake... 




 There are people with thyroid conditions which causes them to gain weight uncontrollably even though they have a healthy diet. 




 Apparently someone already put this up. I didn't see it on here so I thought I was the first person to post it and then learn that someone beat my by an hour. Dammit. So I have to call my own post a repost. I'm so sad.. 














 I agree. It looks pretty good. 




 She didn't choose the wookie life. The wookie life chose her. 




 Where do people get all these photos of my family?! 




 Last year when I spent Halloween in College Station, I got into two car accidents with the same car and had it break down. Then proceeded to push it half a mile into a parking garage. The car was also covered in puke. The worst part about my night? I was sober. 




 Dammit grandma! I said later! 





























 Are you in Texas by any chance? I'm pretty sure I saw this on my grindr 




 There's no need to be coy. I want him to just fuck me. 




 I haven't laughed so much at a comment in a while. Thank you! 




 THIS FAGET PIECE OF SHIT HAS ALREADY GRACED THIS PAGE
FAGET 




 Repost 




 I feel like I saw this the other day... 




 One of my favorite movies too. The first time I watched it, I got so scared and paranoid that I would religiously check every window and door plus any possible entry ways every night for an entire week. 




 Now, who's to say these men are gay? A real gay man would never look this terrible. They're obviously straight. 




 I know your feels bro 




 Fake dummy of Sigourny Weaver from one of the Alien movies maybe 




 Having your foot too close to the side because it has the potential of getting caught perhaps 




 Tommy Defendi (guy on far left) is one of my top fantasies. He is the one who made beards sexy for me. 




 It's either Ajay or Micky off of Fratmen.tv. They're twin brothers. Yes. You read that right. Twins. 




 Damn Tyler Perry. You scary. 




 Even though I like Michelle, upvote for you! 




 Decomposition bitch 




 I'd go with him anywhere... 




 Nice try. Now go cry somewhere because you failed. 




 Never mind. It is Dahmer. 




 As a gay man, I take extra pride in my ability to spell. Maybe you just hang around fucking idiots. 




 I was thinking more along the lines of "Maybe he should coach the Ice King. That guy sucks at catching and keeping his brides." But still, I'm glad you made the reference. :D 




 My heart. These feels. Sigh... 




 Please tell me they actually said that on television. 




 Sometimes I just want to say "Free? You just made it $5 more expensive." 




 The human body has so many toxins and hidden pathogens, you need specialized equipment to safely and effectively remove waste left from decomposing tissue so that other humans won't get diseases. You can't just Clorox that shit. 




 They think our food is weird as fuck too. Calm down OP. 




 The picture on the bill comes from a famous painting depicting Lady Liberty leading the French people into revolution. 









 WHAT STOP WHISPERING FAGET 




 You forgot #swag 




 Meth. Not even once. Just kidding. More like all day, every day. 




 Deer gets hit by car, dog gets free meal. I see no reason to say its wtf 




 You couldn't post the picture of the one with the close up of the balcony of hooded people. Worst repost ever. 









 Can't even begin to say how jealous I am of this... 









 THIS IS SPACEDICKS FAGET
WE ONLY USE CAPS LOCK OTHERWISE YOU'RE FUCKING WHISPERING LIKE A FAGET, FAGET
 




 I should give this to my parents. 




 WHAT 




 Congrats! I just lost my virginity this past September on my birthday. 




 FUCK OFF WITH YOUR NO CAPS SHIT 




 WHAT ABOUT YOUR CAPS LOCK FAGET 




 Very cool. Thanks for sharing. 




 4chan beat you by days. 




 Someone said it but *hearse 




 I just got told that. Sorry about it. 




 Sorry about that. But a simple "hey this is a repost" would've sufficed you fucker. 




 I hide requests and other stuff so I only get statuses and important life events but they slip in and then I think of the other people they're friends and ask "Do you think the other people like to see that stuff either?" Answer is no. 




 I do that too but there's some people I actually like to keep in contact with so I just ask them to stop. They usually do. 









 Inconceivable 




 Aw, you're so sweet! 




 Oh ok. Thanks! 




 It's a pig *gosh you guys* 




 Oh my god, I'm so butthurt. Let me go swig some bleach because I can't take your bullying. I'm so depressed because you said bad stuff about me. 




 *I do my best* 




 Some of the comments are racist? That's outrageous.. 




 *drool* 




 If he doesn't look directly at me, I'd do him morning noon and night. 




 GET THIS SHIT OUT OF HERE YOU FUCKING FAGET 




 You really should. Fantastic movie. Long but worth your time. 




 By proving that they shopped it to be a half a foot longer than what it is? Innovative. You'll go far here. 




 I was just born. How am I typing? 




 What do you gain with this? A sense of accomplishment in falsifying the post and hoping to get karma from it like the fake artist girlfriend poster? Original or not, that alligator is still rather large. This does nothing. 




 Common thing in local Mexican restaurants here in South Texas. 




 Always 




 There's a picture somewhere of them blowing a guy. Just google it, you'll find it. 




 It doesn't matter. But if a white guy does that, it's all over the news and he's a racist. 




 There are plenty if guys, gay and straight, who have nice handwriting. 









 Bitch stole my wig 




 Does OP have a problem with it or OP just jealous and amazed? 




 PETA this and PETA that. PETA bullshit, PETA PETA PETA. 




 It was one of my favorite books as a kid. And my favorite childhood snacks. 




 No hope left. 




 It was nice most of the time. We'd get into little fights but we got over them quickly and everything was good. And being big and not getting guys that often, I have to go for guys that fetishize fat guys. Sometimes it gets creepy. I don't want someone who wants me because I'm a big guy and that's what they like, all those people do enable guys like me to get bigger. I'm trying to shrink, not grow. I want someone who is going to support me in weight loss. I would talk to my ex about it and I asked what would you do if I lost weight and it was a considerable an he literally said he wouldn't be with me anymore. I need to get away from the fetish. But sadly, it probably won't happen. I have to get skinnier before I can find that.  




 It's hard to seperate things because a lot of things I do on a daily basis or some of my mannerisms remind me of him a lot. Things I say, thing I think of just scream out and it just gets me down. My self esteem has always been an issue for me because I'm a fat guy, and I'm trying to change that. It's hard work but I'm trying. He brought me up and then when he said he didn't love me anymore and broke up with me over the phone, it destroyed my confidence. 




 *things I will masturbate to 




 Seriously? Go back to your PETA headquarters and take a piss shower while you're at it.
