 Looking for non-rooted stuff, GO Backup came up as an app that will save your contacts, messages and apps. Must have root to save app data, but if all you need is a way to easily save and re-install favorite apps it seems good enough. Lots of other options if you do a little searching. 




 Yeah, and it isn't even complete. I use Titanium Backup myself, and there are other options for restoring favorites.

But if you want to re-download favorite apps from the play store, try this...

Click the My Android Apps tab

Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click My Orders   Settings

There you'll find your most recent downloads/purchases. Keep in mind it shows all store stuff, so books, music, ect. will be there as well. And if you click the settings in there you can adjust your device list.
 




 That's probably the best bet for most folks. Installing anything other than from a providers site or the play store can break your TOS. Even taking your phone in with the Unknown Sources box checked can break it. 




 Those are all neat launchers. Another one I really liked was Rocket Launcher, but mostly because it seemed to confuse most folks. :)
SPB Shell was a *really* nice launcher for showing off my phone. The idle screen is unparalleled. 




 ...is that a llama up there? 




 Yeah, I'm digging the whole ICS experience myself atm. But I've been using Holo over the other ICS launchers. I was using Apex so I could put widgets in the dock, but they're just unsightly there. With Holo I can still put folders in the dock (which gets rid of my need for Folder Organizer) and I'm loving the app drawer. The favorites tab is my goto spot to launch apps from.
The current favs atm for ICS seem to be Apex and Nova. 




 Yeah, I didn't really want to put up the market Chinese link, it's still in the xda thread if someone really wants it. It's still one I haven't tried yet, though. I'm a Holo fan atm. 




 There are a ton more, but most link to other sites, are other languages, or simply too shady for me to feel comfortable with pointing anyone to them.
Personally, I mostly stick with the Play Store and Amazon for the free daily apps. I only made this list out of boredom one day, and haven't put much into updating it like the others. 




 Thanks, I've got more hours than I can count into these (mostly the launchers) but I'm going through the browsers now and hunting up more. 




 I try to keep the lists updated and as comprehensive as I can. Didn't see anything here, so I thought I'd share with the redditors.

 Training Day is one of my favorites. But, damn, there are a *ton* of good cop movies.

edit: the more I think of it, the more great ones come to mind. L.A. Confidential is probably in my top 20 of all time movies. Fallen is rather cool, too. 




 Beat me to it. I've drilled for quite a few of them. And I've seen some churches hide cell towers in their steeples. Any way to disguse them, they're doing it. Folks want more and better coverage, but don't want to have to look at them. 




 Nope. I can see it, though. I'm pretty sure you're family was killed, and you're flashing back to the past all the time. I can't remember if the whole thing takes place in your house or not, but it's very dark, gothic, and weird.

 Huh. Guess we're screwed. 









 So, you're putting quantity over quality. You're spending so much of your time and resources on making bigger and better looking games that you're surpassing your ability to do them correctly. But as long as people keep eating them up you can move on to the next project feeling justified, I guess. 




 I was working off the Chesapeake Bay and it was below 0 at night. I left my water sitting on my rig and when I saw it the next day, I wondered why it wasn't frozen. The moment I picked it up it froze solid in less than a second. Everyone left water bottles out that night. :) 




 Best Part: So many things. It's unreal how it changed my life.

Worst Part: The scary times. Serious accidents, illnesses, when I'm in a public place and I don't know where she is for a moment or two, etc. That feeling of dread is far worse than any I've ever felt for myself over the course of my life. 




 lol 




 Get someone who knows about such things to install a remote kill switch for the car, and give the remote to your brother. When he knows she shouldn't be driving, he just clicks, and they go nowhere.

Realistically, though, you could have just about anyone who knows about cars put in a regular hidden switch that keeps the car from running. When someone knows she shouldn't drive, they sneak out to the car and flip the switch. Bet it wouldn't cost ten bucks. 




 Um, sounds about right to me. What's your gripe? 




 No, but I have a few I use. Which one I use depends on what kind of comment I want to leave. 




 lol All vid games are like that. But I guess it's all about how you use them. I play here and there, maybe a couple times a week. 




 You mean it's finally dead? Woot! 




 Meh, no. If the ads look like Resident Evil to me, I'm pretty turned off. I'm sure it's "not the same game at all", but it's rare that a FPS game can grab me. Or worse yet, a third person view when you simply shift from target to target with an auto-aim. They all really get monotonous.

I'm pretty hooked on the MMORPGs. I've tried tons of them, paid and free (and there ARE a ton of them.) Dealing with people makes for a much richer experience to me. (For whatever reason, the biggest one, WoW, bores the hell out of me though.) 




 PC only here, too. But I enjoy TF2 quite a bit, still. My game of choice, though has been the same for 6 years, City of Heroes.

 Too many of you are bitching that it's light beer. A couple of my favorite American beers are light. You don't need heavy lager to get good taste. That's not the problem here. A beer fan drinking Natty Light is like a wine fan drinking Thunderbird. Cheap as hell? Sure. But it's not worth drinking that crap for the extra cases they're getting, not to mention the blow to their social statuses. 




 Amen.

 You can sort according most any criteria you wish. I have almost 300 in my instant watch queue, and this is a god-send. It doesn't just sort it in your browser, it sorts the queue itself, so when I start up Netflix on my Google TV, it's sorted by genre first, then in alphabetical order (my preference.) 









 I played it a lot back in the day on my Tandy 1000sx (dual disk drives woot!) but never won it. I'm trying to find a copy of it, but coming up with zilch. Anyone have any ideas?

edit: NM, it's freeware now with it's own site. I quit looking too quickly. 




 Also, steam has awesome holiday sales, not to mention weekly sales on random games. If you decide to go with steam (which I'm loving) make sure to only buy the games you absolutely must have now until you see them on sale.

I think I got over a thousand bucks worth of games this past xmas for less than 200 bucks. I can't remember buying anything less than 75% off, and still have more than 50 or 60 games I haven't even tried yet. 




 Capital One is probably the biggest credit card company. And if you can't get one there yet, get a secured card, by someone like Orchard Bank. Capital One will send you an invite soon if you balance that one well.

If you get a card, use it. Put 30 bucks a month or so on it, or just use it for gas, or something like that. Don't just start using it for shopping. You can quickly get pulled under, then the charges start.

And make sure you pay it off on time, every month. Finance charges are how they make their money, and they make a LOT of money. Those charges will be like throwing your money out the window while you drive down the road.

If you find out you don't have the self-control to use a card wisely, then cancel it quick, and stick with a secured one. 

Just google around a bit for credit advice. You'll see the smart tips being repeated if you spend the time to really dive into it.

And JReitman is right. Don't use them if you don't have the cash to cover them. 




 Never played it. When Majora came out, we were too busy with other stuff to even turn on the TV. It was a few years before I got back into gaming. 




 For a while now he's been all about using his computer as a media center with all the other TVs hooked into it. He lives in a lake house on a lake in Kentucky (his retirement home.) And he's just out of the hospital from some sort of lung infection + pneumonia (on-going problem, had half a lung taken out years ago.) I'm trying to figure out something other than my old standby present, a Hickory Farms assortment pack. He loves them, but surely he'd like something new, and I'm at a loss for ideas really. Got any good suggestions? 




 Zelda's Ocarina game was great on 64, too. Plus I drove myself batty on Shadowman because I didn't see the ledge next to the gondola for at least a week. My friends and I played Perfect Dark all winter one year during lay-off.

 I was just debating this myself a couple of weeks ago. I went with a written one. I've found that I'm much more likely to jot down a note than to open a program or app and type something in. When I was using Google Calender, I found myself having to put it off until it was convenient to do so, only to end up forgetting to do it. Plus, it's just quicker. 




 [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Damazontv field-keywords=seasame+street x=16 y=18) has a few on pay per view, and plenty more on dvd.

 Everything I've tried has resulted in low frame rates. :( 




 At first I figured that it'll be little more than a chat channel for whatever teams join, since I'm sure you won't be able to keep a window open with all members in it. It would be huge. Though I'm sure such a window will be available. Just not practical during gameplay.

But what would be awesome is if when you joined the league, it recommends you to join such and such team, attempting to balance the teams out, distributing healers and tanks and such. 




 I remember those. However, I never knew anyone who actually bought one. 




 So much for my paying attention to things while on a game break. So in i20 we can form leagues? Essentially 48 member teams? Has anyone seen how this is going to work? 
























 Here, take a look at [this good rooting q a](http://www.androidcentral.com/rooting-it-me-some-qa). 




 I have the defender for my X2, and it's a freaking beast. It's big and bulky, but I can't imagine anything else that could protect my phone as well. If you have genuine concerns for your phone in a work environment, this will allay them.  




 Yeah, there might be better rss readers out there, but the few I've tried so far all have some major limitation, and currents works fine for me. This is one of the very few categories of apps where I really haven't bothered to explore alternatives. Guess I have time to browse the market now, though...  




 ...you see reddit as lawful good? It's a screwed up system where quality and genuinely interesting is buried by, well, stuff like this.  




 Well, according to my favorites list, I use Tapatalk, Google TV Remote, and Currents the most.

But it feels like I should say ROM Toolbox, Root Explorer, and MyBackup Pro. 




 That's almost the only reason I always root my phones, so I can flash new and different ROMs. It's true, you can do a whole lot of customizing without root, but I've found it to be just plain fun, not to mention it *does* increase your options for apps and the such. 

That being said, when I got my last phone, I waited until I was certain that if I rooted I would be able to get back to stock. If something were to happen to it, I would want to get it back to original condition for the sake of insurance. 




 Oh. Or that. 




 Well, I would assume that it's smart enough to realize that home is the location where the phone spends the night. And even if it wasn't, I would also assume that you can adjust things manually. 




 Yeah, it's good at what it does, but it's not going to save you much from where you're already at.

However, I've always loved the location part of JD. It used to turn on my WiFi when I pulled up to the house, and turn it off when I left. The same with other common hotspots I frequented. 




 Well, usually flashing a ROM will, or some adb stuff even (though you need to find out exact commands and whatnot, probably from xda). If you're trying to delete various types of data, there are usually apps in the play store that will delete different stuff on your phone.

But a factory reset simply wipes out user apps, settings, etc. It doesn't wipe the phone back to factory new. All kinds of stuff get left on it. 




 Well, since starting a sg costs nothing but a bit of time, someone start one up somewhere. Hell, I'll start it up if y'all want, but I know next to nothing about base building. 




 Well, if you're running stock and haven't flashed or rooted or anything, and you're getting random reboots, then take it to your carrier. Should be their issue to deal with (assuming you keep your insurance up). 




 Well, yeah, it mostly does. However you installed the app after the reset, so the reset can't have an effect on the app, see?

If you just uninstalled and reinstalled to fix it, then it was just a bad download/install the first time around. 




 Sooooo.... are you promoting this app that apparently the guy doesn't want you promoting? 




 There are literally a ton of home launchers. If you're wanting to keep the ICS feel, go with Apex, Nova, or Holo. 




 What sucks is that it still tops out at 20 pages, so I can't see past D. 




 Go to www.cerberusapp.com, log in, click "Help" at the bottom, then click the "I have a rooted device. Can I get additional features?" part.

edit: I'm glad you brought it up, I didn't realize I didn't have it enabled either. Do now. I had to go the .apk route, maybe because of dual sdcards.

 Tried it. How do I find out what the actual video codec is?
 




 After codec/pack after codec/pack (mostly from download.com) failing to play .mkv files, I finally found one [from cccp project](http://www.cccp-project.net/) that will at least let me see the files with WMP 11 (32 bit Vista), but they still won't play. They all show as having a length of 0 seconds. I know the files are fine, they play great in the KMPlayer, but I need WMP to be able to play them in order for my Revue to see them over the network. I've been Googling, installing, unistalling, etc. for 3 hours. I'm officially disgusted. 




 Not that I can notice. 




 Always hit the menu key when you're looking for something, even if it doesn't seem like it would do anything where you are.

For instance, when you're in the WiFi settings, you can hit menu again for more options. This is where I always go after a flash to keep WiFi on even when asleep.

 Well, make sure your family members have your work phone for emergencies, and turn your phone off. Check it on breaks. People survived before cell phones, you know.

And I turn that option off, I'd rather hit the words at the top than have it auto-correcting what it wants me to say.

 That's what I'll do from time to time. but I never stick with the same look more than a week or two. 




 xda can be another good friend. 




 I hope you're not considering CM7. Back stepping there (well, diagonally maybe). [Look through xda](http://forum.xda-developers.com/search.php?searchid=35505095) and see what they have to say about it. Bet there are a ton of comments already. 




 Honestly, that would be annoying enough to me to simply abandon the widget for another from the play store. I am absolutely positive that you can find another you would find more appealing. 




 
Actually, I would probably just split my time going through the basics of operations, through the options on the phone, and through some of the play store apps. 




 Doesn't mean it doesn't work. :) 




 Noted and fixed. You're right of course. 




 lol Thus the list. *With links.* :) 




 Well, besides word of mouth around the forums, I've had a couple Verizon techs tell me this. While it doesn't necessarily mean it's true, it makes it kinda hard to discount.

 ...there's a sentence I never thought I'd stumble upon... 




 SD Speed Increase is always good thing on a fast card. 




 Well, it depends on the device. My little Ascend is unbrickable, but my Strat can be bricked if you're not careful. I thought I had bricked my Droid X2, but after a couple hours of trying to boot into various modes and dozens of battery pulls I got it back. The fact is you *do* need to be careful and certain of what you're doing on various devices. 




 Yeah, I threw it on when iammolotov mentioned it wasn't there. Big oversight on my part there.

edit: OH! Durr, I was bouncing around then so much I lost track of where I was. 




 I actually thought about doing something like that, but my tastes definitely go against the grain.

I can tell you GO Launcher is pretty much the king of GB, but quite a few folks love ADWLauncher EX, Launcher Pro, and Zeam, and Nova and Apex launchers rule ICS. The bulk of the rest of them are pretty much the same, with different options within each that tailor to different peoples needs. In launchers, I put a little list at the top of launchers that are really different from the rest.

With browsers, there are a lot of good ones. Opera is probably the favorite, with lots of Dolphin users. Chrome is really popular on ICS.

As far as app stores go, Play Market is the only one, outside of providers' own apps, that won't break your TOS. Amazon has a lot of followers, mostly due to the free app of the day. GetJar was getting really popular until they dropped their free Gold apps. SlideME and soc.io mall have a few followers, too. 




 Just remember, read, read, read first. Make sure of what you're doing. If you brick your phone (I don't know how easy yours does) you're 100% out of luck (unless you get creative with your insurance...) 




 Insurance? Eh, I don't know.

But to learn to root, [check out what xda has for your phone.](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1603905) 




 Yeah, same with me. I've been using Beautiful Widgets and Recast for my clock and weather, but just switched back over yesterday to HDWidgets. 




 You mean WiFi, don't you? If you're not wanting to use something like Skype, you can use a VoIP app like GrooVe IP. 




 By the way, did you go to the Play Store and simply put in "theft"? 




 Well, for one it will void your Terms of Service, so you can't turn it in if there are any issues unless you flash it back to stock. But the amount of things you can do and apps you can use is greatly increased. 

Myself, I use Cerberus also. 




 Pretty much any VoIP app will. My favorite is Groove IP because you don't need some 3rd party VoIP server. 




 Ok, I put in the link for SlideScreen 2.0 beta that they released openly, since they're not supporting it anymore.

I have a lot more that I always install, but those are some of the good-for-everyone apps I keep.
 




 Right with you there. I really liked Claystone, and was unimpressed with TSF. Updates for both would be welcome. 




 wtf... lol Glancing over it I'm seeing Crome as Chrome. Nice catch, thanks. Fixed.

And I thought about putting in the rating, but once the list got large I put in the Android version required, and that took a long freaking time. So I put off the notion of adding ratings due to time and/or laziness. 
























 lol I went internet only some time ago. Really, pretty much anything is out there. I finally bowed to the pressure of the non-techs in the house and got me some Dish Network. The woman can dvr whatever, it's her's.  




 Cool, it made the store, thanks for the tip.  




 More than you'd think. NetFront Life Screen, Rocket Launcher, SPB Shell, and Launcher 8 are the first that spring to mind.  




 When installed, did you go into your phone's settings  applications, find your app, clear defaults, data, etc? When unistalled, did you search for any associated folders and files saved on your phone ?  




 What, the list? Since the list has gotten so large and launchers have become more common I now watch the Play Store and check out all the new apps coming through, keep my eye on xda, periodically Google around, and listen to what people point out. It used to be updated every month or two, but I got tired of spending hours and hours at a time updating. Now I spend just a few minutes every day or two seeing what's new or what I've missed. I've also followed a suggestion to post the updates recently.  




 It has face recognition also, though I haven't played with it yet.  




 Now, I'm not sure if it has a limit to the number of previous episodes available or not. I just know I wanted to listen to How to Succeed in Evil (liking it a lot btw) and with 70+ chapters, the other podcast apps wouldn't let me start at the beginning. So I know Podkicker lets me go back at least that far.  




 So I can have access to more than 30 or however many previous episodes. I couldn't start at the beginning of a long podiobook. Podkicker doesn't give me that limitation.  




 I used them both, and prefered PocketCasts. But I could only download so many episodes. Since I also wanted to use my pod player for Podiobooks books (which can have tons of chapters) I use Podkicker now.  
Really, they are all very similar. 




 I posted this before, but it's gotten huge since then. It's now organized by minimum Android version needed to make it easier to navigate and find something you like.

 Just looking around for other game clients that are worth looking into. I know of Games for Windows and Origin, but that's about it. Am I just not finding really good game clients or is Steam pretty much the only good one? 




 It is 100% wrong that I can buy a product that doesn't work, though is claimed to work, and the seller doesn't need to refund, fix, exchange, or make any kind of effort to resolve it other than shrugging their shoulders and saying "look around, maybe you kind find a way to fix this broken thing we sold you." It is wrong in any venue. 




 Yes. After each install. I've ran out of ideas. 




 I haven't even the words anymore.

I read the fine print, I know it says you don't issue refunds. But you sold me an unplayable game. Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock has a glitch that won't allow me to pass a certain point in the game, a point none too deep I might add. I read the forums (I'm not the only one who has the glitch), attempted to contact the makers (never did respond), and have spent hours trying to get by it randomly (did once, but died immediately afterwards and got sent to the beginning of the level again, never could repeat getting past the glitch). All was for naught.

So in the end I was sold, by you, a game that cannot be played. Or at least, can only be played up to a point (London Underground II) and cannot be completed. May as well call it a demo that can only be played a few levels in.

As such, I can't see how it would be possible that I wouldn't be due a refund. I've uninstalled and re-installed the game (which didn't help), and have once again uninstalled it for good.

BTW, if you have a fix for the game, I would be eternally grateful and would accept that in lieu of a refund.

Just give me the playable game I paid for or refund my money please.

Hello Scur,

As with most software products, we will not offer refunds or exchanges for purchases made online as outlined in the software license - please review Section 3 of the Steam Subscriber Agreement for more information.

Please send me a copy of your conversation with this third party support team, which outlines what steps youve taken to try to get the game working on your computer and I will investigate this matter further.

I told them the same things I told you, essentially. Not much more to add. They still haven't contacted me, and I still paid you, Steam, for a game I can't play. In what world are you living in which that can't possibly be one of the few exceptions where you must provide a refund?

I have 185 games so far on Steam. Are we really going to fall out of favor with each other over this?

...did you even read my original statement? I HAVE attempted to "troubleshoot my issue with the third party support team," but they will not respond after repeated attempts to contact them. I cannot force them to respond. Apparently you are privy to some secret method of making someone sit down and writing an email.

So I guess the dollars you've accepted from me in the past will have to suffice for the total amount you will ever receive from me. I will continue to use steam and play the games I've paid for, but you will NEVER see another cent from me again.

Thanks for nothing.


11 Message by you on Tue, 11th Dec 2012 10:05 am
Oh, wait. Scrolling up I see I told you twice that they won't respond. So apparently you're a dimwit who can't read, but can somehow copy/paste company-issued answers. Please have someone else respond. Preferably someone who knows how to spell "Victor,"

And your supervisor would be preferable. I'd like him/her to see that you didn't even give my responses a cursory glance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So in my aggravation with Wiktor, I called him a dimwit. I'll apologize in my final response to him, then close the ticket since he isn't interested in even reading anything.

So can you tell me, where do I stand? Steam just sold me a game I can't play or get any kind of support or response from the third-party developer, and now keeping my $8.99 with a "Sorry we sold you a game that has a glitch that won't let you play it, or get help with fixing, but we're going to keep your money."

I really do have a crap-ton of games on Steam (granted, the bulk of my items aren't the high-dollar new games but games bought during sales), and have never had this kind of trouble with Steam before. I would gladly continue to purchase games from Steam if we could resolve this, but the developer won't help or even respond, and it seems that Steam isn't very interested in anything except pointing their finger to the deaf ears of the devs and saying "I know we took your money, but take your problems up with them."

Hello Scur,

Thank you for contacting Steam Support.

I'm sorry you are having an issue with this game. 

When did you contact the third party support team?

If they have not responded to your original ticket, I would suggest creating a new support ticket with them. It is possible the ticket has been lost in their system. 

They will be able to assist you in resolving the issue.

3 Message by you on Thu, 13th Dec 2012 4:49 pm

I emailed support 3 times. Can you please just refund my money? It's become obvious that no help is coming. As I said before, I really don't want to have a falling out with Steam over $8.99, but I can't just allow myself to be ripped off like that by a corporation, as in paying for a product that doesn't work and to be refused a refund, a fix, or a replacement. I'm stubborn like that.

Hello Scur,

We do not offer refunds or exchanges.

Our records indicate that you have played this game for nearly ten hours, effectively using the license.

At what point in the game does the glitch occur? 

Have you tried the community discussions/forums for help?

5 Message by you on Sun, 16th Dec 2012 2:41 pm

I played for 10 hours trying to get past the glitch. I didn't just hit a wall and demand a refund. I put in a LOT of time, as in hundreds of attempts, to get past the glitch. It is during the London Underground II level. When I boost River up the second wall, she's supposed to reach down and pull the Doctor up, as she would any other wall. Instead she just jumps down to follow me.

Yes, I've hit the forums. Others have found this glitch, and no one knows a way to get past it.

So I have an unplayable game. Thanks for the info that you will do nothing except keep my money. I can now officially say that you've seen my last dime, and any new games I buy in the future will be through some other means. I will continue to use the games I've already bought from you in the hopes that every time I play a multi-player it will cost you some small bit and you'll never ever receive any more compensation for it from me.

Again, thanks for being the giant conglomerate that cares more about 9 bucks than, up until now, a dedicated customer. Don't send me any more rationalizations for your greed, please, it just increases my ire.

6 Message by you on Mon, 17th Dec 2012 4:21 am

Here at a later time, I'm re-reading this conversation and realizing I didn't play anywhere near 10 hours. Maybe I left it on or something, but I played an hour or less when I hit the glitch, and I know I spent more time than that off and on trying to get past it. Not that it changes anything or that you folks care or anything. Just putting that out there.

Hello Scur,

Can you provide a link to some of these forum discussions showing the issue?

8 Message by you on Tue, 18th Dec 2012 3:05 am

They're your forums, I'm not doing any more leg work. I've washed my hands of Steam, keep the nine bucks for all I care.

9 Message by Support Tech Raymond on Tue, 18th Dec 2012 10:15 pm

Hello Scur,

Please feel free to reply or reopen this ticket when you have the necessary information.

10 Message by you on Wed, 19th Dec 2012 3:26 pm

Necessary for what? For you to continue telling me you won't help me in any way? What possible reason can I have to continuing this conversation? It's obvious Steam will do absolutely nothing about the faulty product that they sold to me, except pushing me to find my own answers about possible solutions to the glitch. Am I wrong?

11 Message by you on Wed, 19th Dec 2012 3:30 pm

I am so utterly disappointed in Steam, so instead of fruitlessly looking for solutions that don't exist or trying to get any sort of resolutions from Steam, I am going to spend my efforts in showing everybody that I can what kind of company Steam really is when the chips are down. I think Reddit is a good starting point. 









 Yup, GrooVe IP for me too. I'm always around WiFi, got tired of that Verizon bill since becoming a cord cutter.  




 I'm looking for alternative to the Google Voice app to text with my Voice account. I don't keep service on my phone, only over WiFi these days, and found that the Google Voice app isn't really the best. Sometimes texts won't show up in the inbox, only in the text box, so I'm not alerted. Any one know of maybe a mms, sms, or IM app that can work with Voice without service and only use WiFi? Or even some ideas? I haven't found anything yet. 




 lol I guess I stand corrected. That's a nice-looking home screen. 




 Different:

Claystone Launcher

Hi Launcher

NetFront Life Screen

Rocket Launcher

SPB Shell 3D

ssLauncher

TSF Shell
 




 I have 14 monks that are buying Smartphones off of me.

Another sentence I would have never believed that I would hear. 




 [Advanced Pro Widgets](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rdr.widgets.core feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5yZHIud2lkZ2V0cy5jb3JlIl0.) are great if you do a lot of socializing on your phone. 




 While I agree that Task Killers aren't the best way to go, my Androids have always had memory and lag issues until I fiddle with the minfree values. I don't have a newer phone anymore, and I hear that Android has gotten better about memory management, but the GB phones I have now all have issues until I use AMM or V-6 Supercharger on them. I like lots of tools and system apps though that like to take up memory. When I restore apps on a fresh GB ROM, my phones all lag until I make adjustments. Stock GB just doesn't handle them well. Without those adjustments, I can easily see why task killers are so popular. 




 I saw that featured in an Android article somewhere recently. Seems fine for women, but for guys? Meh... 




 I do that while I'm waiting for my inrupublic invite to come. I use GrooVe IP for phone calls over WiFi and Google Voice for texting. That way I can still use my Google Voice number for everything and on my new phone, too. 




 Also Android Community, Android and Me, Android Atlas, Android Guys, Talk Android, Androinica, AndroidPIT, IntoMobile, AndGeeks.

I use Pulse to view feeds lately, and those pop up in addition to the aforementioned. 




 Reversed tethering and a WiFi hotspot are the 2 apps you need. xda probably has them. Or you could just take a router with you. 




 I remember someone on some forum, xda maybe, who wanted to have something like that. Reversed tethering, I think he called it. So you just need reversed tethering and a hotspot app. I would search the forums for those 2 things. 




 [Here's a youtube comparing them against each other.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdU4jFmUGtA) 




 I used an app from the ap store, don't remember the name. But I just searched for "remove contacts" and poked through the results until I found something that looked good and would perform batch functions. 




 On my revue I'm mostly watching Amazon (I have Prime), Crackle, and Project Free TV. 




 Yeah, gratz on the first post, ignore the trolls with the low self-esteem. 




 Gratz! It's all uphill from here. :) 




 In today's world? As opposed to what, the dark ages?

Raising a child is a joyous responsibility I guess. My daughter is a part of me, so my life is just bigger. Sure it's life changing, but it's not life ending. If you're ready for a kid, have one. If not, then don't. You're over-thinking the whole thing, I think. 




 FWIW, as you'll discover in the Revue's browser, most of the major US broadcast and cable networks deliberately block access to their streams from Google TV devices. They don't like Google.

That's why I use the Clicker and Spotlight apps. They point you to streaming sites that allow GTV. And I have a HD antennae to watch local channels (albeit rarely). I was just hoping someone had some great free streaming sites or apps that I haven't yet. So far, Crackle is pretty much the only decent free site for streaming movies. 




 Bit on the dangerous side. :)

I've done a ton of geotech drilling all over south of 395 between South Capitol and 12th SE, so there are a lot of plans for knocking down older buildings and putting up new stuff that they haven't even started yet. 




 Did you ever notice that the lights on 7th sync at different times? I've made it all the way from Constitution to Silver Spring without stopping a few times after 4 pm. 




 It's kinda pathetic. Hardly anything there. Baltimore Aquarium is the one to visit. If you can survive the drivers, that is. 




 Link isn't working. For me, anyway. 




 I learned the hard way that one should *always* skip the National Aquarium in the Hoover building. 




 I recently ditched cable (live in small town, WAY overpriced) and went to just internet. So far I use Avia w/ Logitech Media Server to play anything on my computer, and it works fine. But as far as streaming, what are your options? So far I use Amazon Instant Video and Netflix, have a bookmark on my home to Crackle, and use Clicker and Spotlight apps from time to time to find other stuff. What sites/apps haven't I found yet? 




 I have a Revue, so I use a few apps to find stuff. Amazon Prime covers most of Netflix, so I dropped Netflix. Clicker and Spotlight are decent apps to find GoogleTV friendly channels. Cracked actually has quite a few decent movies, and it's free. Hulu won't play on Google TV, though, and I haven't found a free way to stream online content from my puter to my Revue yet. Avia will stream all my videos and whatnot from my hard drive, though. 




 I spent 7 yrs in NoVA and still didn't hit all the museums on the mall. 




 That I raised an awesome girl. 




 It was Detroit PD at first, but if there was any kind of evidence that suggested another state was involved, it would become federal. (best guess) 




 EAZY! 




 Perhaps a button at the top to open/close it? It would be nice to not have it taking up so much screen space. 




 Well, when I go to /r/Android in my normal Chrome, there's a big list of links in the right-side bar. How will it show that bar? 




 SwiftKey is my favorite, too. The predictions are awesome. And I went through the options to get it to behave as I liked.  




 The old market app downloaded and installed as many at once as they could.

The new play store app will put them in a queue. It will download one, then it will install it. While it's installing the first app, it will download the second app. If the app is finished downloading before the first is finished installing, it will wait for the install to finish. It won't download a third app until the second one begins installing. So it will only  do 2 things at any time: download a single app and install a single app. 




 I've become a fan of "Fast for Facebook" myself. 




 The reason why Google apps aren't included with CyanogenMods is because they aren't allowed to include Google apps with the custom mods. Copy-write laws and all that. So Google apps (gapps) must be installed separately. 




 Sigh.., it's neither of those. 




 Not a rock, but yes, [it's alive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyura_chilensis). Or was. 




 Yeah, I just tried it. 15 mins later everything was uninstalled. 




 WTF. I had mine still within warranty when it slid off the couch. Fell less than a foot and a half onto a carpeted floor, and broke the screen. They told me they wouldn't help me. 




 Nice looking widgets, but I keep those in a toggle bar in my dropdown. Much handier place to keep them, imo.

I do like that WiFi widget, though. Good idea. 




 So what's up with this, is it a nice setup? 




 My X2 has a HDMI port, so when I wasn't using it it sat next to the TV and streamed video (damn you, Hulu!) and my Ascend was given to my 8 yr. old daughter with GrooVe IP so she has her own phone as long as she's within WiFi. 




 That's how I feel about heights. When I was a kid I climbed trees and jumped from branch to branch like a monkey. Now if I try to, say, climb a ladder to the roof, by the time I get to the top I'm almost paralyzed. It's a horribly nerve-racking feeling. It doesn't matter how badly I want up there, it's just completely beyond my control. 




 I used it and really liked it, but there was some limitation (that I can't remember now) that kept me from using it like I wanted to. 




 Well, almost. I find it more enjoyable to manage my phone than actually use it. I love fiddling with it, and have been know to flash half a dozen times in a day.
