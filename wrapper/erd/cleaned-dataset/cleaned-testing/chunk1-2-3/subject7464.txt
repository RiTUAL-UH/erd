 Can neither confirm or debunk what you said, but the table in [this article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_Chinese_surnames) might be useful... 
























 Came across [this woman's account of her attack](http://dayre.me/davienne/pLKsQpVoUr). She's also a young Singaporean in he mid-twenties and similarly, her attacker was a cyclist that came across her on a walkway at night.

Thanks for sharing your experience. Reading both of your accounts has reminded me that I should not take it for granted that Singapore is a relatively safe place. Heck, i walk home past midnight along dimly-lit walkways quite often without batting an eyelid. Not sure if I'd dare to do so anymore.  
























  Don't pursue her through texts, use texts to arrange meet ups. Texts can easily be misinterpreted and not to your advantage.

I'm a girl and cannot agree more with this. I personally don't like texting someone I barely know at length and many of my friends feel the same way. Face-to-face is the way to go!
