 Go with the Samsung, their Samsung SSD Magician software taks the guess work out of configuring the OS to best suit your SSD. 














 And for the record the SR71 flew at such a stupendously high altitude there was no chance of a collision. 




 As I said, I'm over you. 
You're probably feeling like a great keyboard warrior, but really you're coming across like a massive douchebag. 




 I'm actually over you. 




 Couldn't agree more.

If you ever get the opportunity to see one either fly or up close, take it, they're majestic beasts. 




 [edited]

Look, my point was if there was an unfortunate series of events, the TCAS is the last hope to avoid a collision. 

Without their transponder operational, TCAS is useless.

I'm not saying they ever got close enough to cause this, or ever intended to but having their transponder off in such an environment (around civvie aircraft) is reckless, surely you could agree to that. 




 [edit]

TCAS has and will continue to saves lives should the absolute worst happen, and while the Russians may be stellar points, murphy's law dictates everyone can fuck up, and having your transponder on can avoid turning a mistake into anything worse. 




 It was humungous. I saw it fly, it almost appears to hover in mid-air. 




 5 foot 7 inches = 67inches.
According to Ask.com the average Banana is around 8inches,
So I'm 8 banana's tall. 









 Ah, sorry I misunderstood. They had to blow it out of proportion for a good media show!  




 The point is they required flights to be diverted away, which means they were enough of a threat -close enough to to an air corridor to warrant be a threat.

Of course you *can* fly without a transponder anywhere in the world, however if you're going to do it next to/around a busy commercial air corridor expect trouble.. 




 A plus 1 for you Sir. 




 The reason they had to be escorted away immediately is because the world has a very effective and proven collision avoidance system, but but it relies on an active [transponder](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision_avoidance_system) which the douchebags had turned off. 

Do you really think this would have been so funny if a commercial airliner collided with one of these guys because that was a real possibility.

You can't just fly in international airspace without your transponder on, that is just incredibly arrogant and puts lives at risk. 

Of course they knew this was going to happen the moment they flew into commercial airspace. 

For fucks sake why are they risking an international disaster by bringing down an airliner in a mid air collision while the world is itching for an excuse to start WW3? 




 Petrol starts to naturally break down, and only lasts a few months once it's been processed.

 I've just freshly installed it into chrome, thank you for suggesting it. I couldn't agree more about the devs implementing it, would result in less edits, and more intelligible posts.

However for people who don't/can't use Chrome I feel it would be a well used feature, and can't fathom why it's not included. 




 Ah, thank you will install on my Desktop.

Although I use Opera mobile when browsing and posting on the go (so most of the time) so having a feature which isn't browser dependent would be nice.

 No, 2 reasons why I think not:
1- when you have testers in the field you're introducing the human element, and exposing it to be be seen by eagle eyed enthusiasts. Or just simply left in your local pub.. (e.g.infamous iPhone debacle)

2- If you want something released for public consumption it needs to be certified, and with certification companies releasing their records almost immediately. (E.g htc One camera leaked.)

 Proper green stone jewelry, an appalling amount (especially the stuff in the tourist shops) is actually cheap Chinese jade.

If you want proper Greenstone rock on over to the Westcoast. Any reputable seller will happily tell you where it's from.

Be prepared to fork out a bit for it though, proper greenstone can be quite expensive due to Ngai Tahu's exclusive rights to sell it.

 Ah I see. I'll report that then. App dev's aught to be paid for their hard work.
Also Reddit post says:
"submitted 19 hours ago by [deleted]" hence why I thought your account was deleted! Odd. 




 My point was (however ineloquently stated) why should we report it, you need a valid reason. Just saying "an app for piracy" is useless without a context, like maybe this dude had his app stolen? 

Secondly don't link to it with the main header, as that just piques your interest into downloading it, which rather defies the original purpose of the post. 

That makes me think this was thinly veiled (and rather shameless) advertising. 

But then that probably explains why the dude's deleted his account.

Every day man! :-) 









 Well I can thank you for putting me right. 
I strive to make at least semi educated comments, and it's become apparent I have missed the mark here somewhat. Consider me enlightened. :-) 




 I respect what you're saying, but as a layman I have only my opinions based upon reported isolated incidents- articles like this? And other stories brought to me by the media. 
I only know what I read on the internet, and (as with most subjects) what the media portrays. 

Based upon the above my comment still stands however based upon my opinion formed. 

As you're educated on the subject I understand where you're coming from and it must be frustrating to read comments like mine, but let's be honest here, it's not likely to change as the media aren't going to change how they report things of this nature - e.g. "anticorruption measure" stories will get buried amongst stories about corrupt officials each and every time, so can you blame me?  




 I'm saying the country as a whole is very average - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_India

"..But many analysts believe India's sprawling bureaucracy and weak institutionsthe police and judiciary were ranked as the second and third most corrupt institutions in India, respectively, after political partieshave thwarted convictions, and arguably increased incentives for bribery. In recent years, graft pervaded society from small-scale "harassment bribes" (payments for essential social services) to scandals on a national level. At least 42 percent of young Indians have paid a bribe, according to a 2012 Hindustan survey"
[source](http://www.cfr.org/corruption-and-bribery/governance-india-corruption/p31823)

And I specifically refer to the corrupt judge's trial - http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bribery-charges-trial-against-judge-may-finally-begin/article4978237.ece

And now this, which the high court has thrown out as clearly some very dodgy motions were passed without due diligence. 




 Just got home, baby is in bed, I'm on Reddit to unwind after a bloody long day! I'm a kiwi so 7.30pm here!  :-) 














 The night mode didn't adjust for 'night mode' at all. Then I went into my default Samsung camera, selected Night Mode, then hopped out and back into 'a better camera' and voila - night mode activated.

Also flicking between front and back screens causes the camera to freeze for around 2 seconds.

Also changing to and from Video - camera mode causes screen to freeze, need to escape it and get back in.

And HD video quality is piss poor when pixel peeping vs stock Samsung S4.

On the PLUS side, takes very nice HDR photos.

 Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you my Prime Minister.. 




 I found Opera crashed frequently, but that was a few months ago I last tried it.

To be honest my phone didn't feel "right" after installing it, Apps were a bit slow to respond, and crashed infrequently, but often enough to make me uninstall, and everything went back to normal.  




 Thank you kindly good sir.

Edit: Actually it is a much better low-light camera than the standard App, (Samsung S4) as it focuses better, and with the HDR mode always on, offers an advantage over the HDR mode over the Stock S4 camera as HDR has to be selected everytime, through a rather clunky menu. 

Very good, and hell, it's free so always a worth a shot! 




 Perhaps forgive my ignorance, but why not take the SIM card out and put it into your phone? The contacts may be old, but could still have "mum"or "dad".

 Best comment I've seen on Reddit for a very long time. 

Nice.  




 Actually 4K is rather useful for video editors and even downsampled to 1080p is actually significantly higher quality than native 1080p.

Also with 4K TV's becoming eye poppingly cheap it's quite affordable for people replacing their current sets. 

And furthermore given the competitor has been offering this feature for a while you can't tell me there's not a market for it. 




 Yes, but as I mentioned earlier the 4mp module on the HTC M8 simply doesn't have the same dynamic range of the higher pixel sensors resulting in washed out highlights and lack of detail in the shadows.

I agree Apple have things right - they've gone with 8mp coupled with phenomenal software support resulting in one of the best cameras for an all round solution. 

I have an S5 and cannot understand how awesome the phase detection is for focusing, especially in low light. But why they didn't incorporate all the technologies into a single unit is beyond me.

I'm hoping HTC pull finger and release an awesome unit (phase detection/range finder/OIS), coupled with fantastic camera software (Zoe?) and just blow everyone out of the water. 




 I don't know if you read the review, they had to deliberately cool the phone down between benchmarks. LG were contacted who advised they are still tweaking the final product, so perhaps it was a pre-release hiccup.

I reckon Qualcomm have got a lot riding on this after Samsung's snubbing, so I daresay they'll be working closely with LG to ensure there are no issues. 




 No. 
Extra megapixels also allow you to crop photos after you've taken them.
Extra megapixels allow higher quality (read:4k) camera capabilities.
(Note this last point may be why HTC rumours indicate 2 camera modules on the M9? - 1 high pix for UHD video, other Low "ultrapix" module.)
 




 You have to hand it to HTC, however you needn't look any further than the decision by Sony to [release the Z3 as a 1080 screen](http://au.ibtimes.com/xperia-z3-sony-unwilling-sacrifice-battery-life-2k-smartphones-1368833) which they were slated for and forced to explain why. (Battery life of course..)

However it proves the world (as of September 2014) wants 1440+ higher screen sizes in their flagships, so it's going to be a risky move. Then again HTC are if anything happy to take risks! 




 It was extremely hampered by early reviews and the narrow dynamic range. GSMarena slated it as even when down grading the competitors camera from X-4MP they still did significantly better. 
(I will say except for low light, where the camera excelled but realistically most people want a good all rounder than an awesome 1-thinger.)  




 Bother. Thank you very much for answering my question :) 




 I missed having a flashlight widget too much.. Or have they fixed that?  




 Thanks, that's a good idea. 




 No offence, but isn't that cutting off my nose to spite my face? I still want to listen to music on my phone, I just don't like the spotify wakelock keeping my phone awake when I've already closed Spotify! 




 I do. 

It's just frustrating that it's not a 'feature' I can turn off, as I usually (as most people do.) turn my phone off and keep listening on their desktop, not realizing their phones are quietly still running.  




 I was listening to music on my mobile, but closed it via the X on the notification widget. However when I started listening soon after on my desktop I still had Spotify controls on my lock screen only. 

I guess the *feature* here is you can pause/next your music without going back to the Application on your desktop. The severe downside is it keeps a wakelock open, draining your phones battery.

Because it doesn't display the ability to shutdown (No widget in the Notification centre) so I've found the only way to stop the wakelock is to Force Stop the Spotify Process in Android Application Management.

Ignore if this doesn't bother you, but I use Spotify on my desktop to save my battery life, which makes it kinda pointless to keep my phone awake.

 We need an ELI5 for saturation points on phones.

I mean yes there are still untapped markets, but most of those won't be buying 2k screens at current flagship prices, so how can they gaze into their crystal ball and say 2k are going to be the mainstay when most people don't want over 5.5 inch devices, and with the market flooded with such devices why your average Joe would choose a 2k screen over last years flagship with a normal HD panel?

 The simple fact is people will do stupid shit and try and run regardless of whether the police will chase them, in nz we've had quite a few people die from smashing their car after the police have even called off chases minutes before.

You can't apply rationality to irrational people. 




 I see your point, but I would argue it was made our business the moment they went public. 




 That's an interesting, and probably quite accurate account, as it explains the medical check too. 




 Weird. 

I get the feeling we really got kept in the dark/were deliberately misinformed and mislead over this whole story. 

Like they wanted to paint a picture of what an awesome person she was so we'd keep an eye out for her.

While negating to inform us the circumstances under which she was found, and then offering us the teaser "She was checked by medical personnel" makes me believe she was far from the perfect mother etc portrayed by the media.
 




 That was sooooo satisfying to watch.

People running from the police are so fucking selfish, it's good to see some good old fashioned street justice. 




 Oh, so they love to know where you are without a warrant, but god help you if you want to find out where they are?

 Actually captured him quite well. Good job. 




 However he's also managed to oversee a government which has approved some of of the most utterly appalling environmentally crippling policies like allowing dumping on the Great Barrier reef. 

He's also attracted world wide ridicule by attempting to deny climate change. 




 I hope so. 

the ISOCELL is a very interesting development in Pixel technology, I strongly believe that when paired with a good OIS it will bring superior low light performance over standard BSI OIS sensors. 




 I was kinda hoping for an ISOCELL OIS camera module, but 20MP doesn't sound like it.
The Sony IMX240 equipped Note4 with OIS wasn't the best in low-light.

Still very exciting! 









 I'm sorry but are they fucked in head? 

Fuck this makes me angry. 
Fucking greedy corporations who can't be fucked to clean up their act. 
Egged on by fucking greedy politicians who want their campaign money. 
And stupid fucking residents for allowing this to happen.

The environment is just fucked. Doesn't even stand a chance. 




 There are more than one ways to skin a cat - like with Sony's curved sensor array promising higher light sensitivity!

The simple (and tragic fact) is more/bigger pixels are not feasible while the market craves smaller devices.

 Android RAM management has become significantly better than older Android versions. These days with richer Applications and more RAM than ever before actually clearing your RAM can result in an impact to battery life as the OS needs to reload the Apps back into the RAM you just cleared. (For instance most Opera Mobile using desktop mode has over 200-300MB of RAM constantly.)

Likewize with Application cache (the other reason people use them) I can appreciate people who have very limited device storage using them, but they're a crutch as if you have to use it more than once a week due to space issues, chances are you need to upgrade your phone anyway. 




 lol. Then you'll get people complain about the noise, you can't win! :D 




 I appreciate that sentiment, I don't know what phone you have, but the S5's "phase detection autofocus" is light and day difference over the not-awful S4's focus.

but yes, I hear you on the low light issue. 
This is something that needs to be fixed on the sensor as IOS is not the silver bullet we need.

(From the screenshot comparisons between the S5 and Note4 (although different sensor Sony IMX240 vs Samsung's Isocell) the differences for the lowlight shots are not as awesome as I expected the OIS to be able to perform with the Note4.) 




 Had a wee chuckle at your comment- brings back memories!
 




 Well said. 




 It is but it's certainly a step in the right direction. I think most consumers have come to accept a slight protrusion, however 12mm (plus screen etc so more like 15mm) might be a tad thick. However you are getting 3x optical zoom!

 I know! They make fantastic (if horrendously expendy) filters too, so I have little doubt this module will be to a high quality standard.

Can't wait for camera samples. 




 The way I read it makes it sound like she blamed the bus for not being loud enough, so she didn't bother looking. 




 My S4 took significantly better photos (edit: In good light!) than our $600 Fujifilm EXR from 2011 though. 

People who want better quality will always buy a better dedicated camera, I'm talking about the entry level ($100 cameras etc.) 




 Nah, it's only a suggestion. :) 




 Indeed, the only digital zoom I'll ever appreciate is the Nokia Lumia Pureview digital zoom implementation. 




 Yeah, I hope that Stuff have just edited out that little sound bite out of context, because blaming the bus for being silent and then admitting you didn't bother looking doesn't make her come across as the sharpest knife in the drawer.

Of course if she's a Redditor and would like to defend herself I welcome her side of the story. (If there's more to it.) 




 Thanks, I didn't realise it was also stabilised! 

Yes, however due to the fact it was developed by a 3rd party - Hoya I'm hoping it's not patented to Asus, and could potentially make an appearance on other devices. 









 I really wish I could post this to the r/nottheonion/ but Stuff are such a shit tabloid news site they don't accept submissions any more from there! Anyway, this is pure Darwinism in action. 

I also laughed at the fact they had comments which had to be disabled, I'm guessing due to the fact they ripped this girl a new one for actually blaming the bus for being "silent".  









 NZ, no such luck in our High Schools unfortunately, although that was 10 years ago so things may have changed, but I doubt it.

Not even as an optional study, I would have taken that class in a heartbeat. 




 That is very cool that you get taught about the myths though. 




 You have myths class?!  




 Awesome, gosh that was quick!
I'm surprised this ran on your phone, it doesn't support Kit-Kat.

 The silly thing is the fact most Applications on your cellphone can do this, and much much more: 
See your photos, record your voice, view your location hostory, view your website history.

Yet everyone just clicks the "Install" button without a second thought.

Yet God forbid a company are actually OPEN about the fact that in order to provide you a service using your voice they WARN you that your voice is being recorded.

Come on people. Props to Samsung for being open about this at least. 




 LG are just as bloody bad!
"LG smart TVs send data about users' files and viewing habits to the company"

 Anyone else reminded of the movie "Alive"?  




 Brutal.  




 Well you see on your graph how the 'awake' is damn near a constantly solid line! 
While your Screen on graph is only sporadic and doesn't match with your 'awake' line.

This basically indicates there's errant background processes which is sapping your battery life.

These errant processes are usually:
Google scanning for your location (as requested by Adware on your cellphone)
Google Now waking up your phone to either see your location or present you new cards.
Weather Apps/widgets updating.
Email/Facebook apps updating themselves.
Background data use (think Spotify/music playing etc.)

The best way to determine what's sapping your battery life is to get Wakelock Detector.
(However due to the fact Google are bastards they don't want you to be able to access the indepth analysis battery stats.)
So you need to use a work around (nothing scary!).

Step 1- acquire a windows PC.
Step 2- Go here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r3VlhZIZVSufZlAeICJet6QBtyAF7z06_ysl1kUKME4/edit#slide=id.g298bc178a_00
Step 3- follow instructions.

I've done it a few times now, this will allow you to actually see your Wakelock stats (so in effect that's sapping your battery life by waking up your phone!)

Once you have your Wakelock stats post a screenshot on this subreddit can we can help you to determine what's the matter. 




 Sweet jesus man. Your battery life must be awful.

Are you worried about your battery life? What do you get - my year old S4 got 4hours SOT /8 hours standby.
 









 But is upping the pixels the best way to do this?  




 To answer the op, technically no. But it's very relative to your previous experience with screens. 

What I mean is if you haven't had an amoled before and look at the note 4 you may think the color and other amoled properties are a QHD attribute. 


There's the old (and very relevant) issue of the human eye simply being unable discern the individual pixels, above a certain dpi. 

This shouldn't be ignored, however at 5.7 inches I'm willing to believe those with extremely good eye sight can see a difference under optimum conditions. 

Is it worth it (I know not what op asked, but these two questions are closely related) for most people an awesome FHD amoled will provide the same wow factor and provide awesome battery life. 




 I feel mislead by the title, I thought op meant Don Hertzfeldt's rejected: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkrJB7Q0X3Q 









 There's something deeply insidious about this. 




 Does it play clash of titans?  




 How many people clicked the link just to see the lesbians kiss? Come on.. you know you did. 




 What aren't dashcams good for?! 

Seriously, there are now entire Youtube channels dedicated to dashcam footage from Europe.

And now just entertainment, we've benefitted scientifcally with detailed footage of meteor showers for instance.

And now one's capture a freaking commercial plane crash! That's awesome. 




 Considering what that man has done for science - take it out of the classroom and into millions of peoples living rooms I'm stoked someone has found an appropriate way to ensure his legacy will live on. (Aside from DVD and Bluray sales of his shows of course.)

It's a great honour and bestowed upon a worthy person. 




 Plot twist: all 4 dead were found in the morgue!

Thank^you^I'll^let^myself^out 




 Thousands of men all around the around laugh nervously and cross their legs. 




 What's the icon?!
 




 You're right, and "State commisioned murder" has such a lovely ring to it.. /s! 









 It just adds to the abhorrent nature of the crime commited by the police.

I think the wording was carefully chosen in the article to articulate the difference between the police forces.

The ranks of the elite riot police wear **riot gear** for protection. 

The ranks of these scum wear **masks** for anonymity. 




 There's something deeply wrong on so many levels as that sentence: "masked police". 

Any police that are wearing masks are instantly not worthy if the title "police". They are criminals posing as police. 









 Samsung have a reasonable video editor in their "Samsung store".

I can edit videos taken, and then compile my own videos from the clips on my Samsung s4.

Maybe see if there's an alternative for your device? Or see if you can acquire and sideload the apk?  




 So chump change for them then? 
This is the rich making the poor on a merry dance while their friends rob them blind.  




 This is a genius post! Catch upvotes by laying a trap for all the lonely posts without upvotes. 
Outstanding logic.  




 Your parents were probably having some fun to the #1 song on Sunday, July 27th 1986 which was: 
Sledgehammer by Peter Gabriel

Too much information. 




 sadly no....... I'm sure it's out there! 




 I know. Well done on doing your homework, it's stuff like this that I'm sure Stuff aren't allowed to post for fear of their masters coming down on them. 

It's sickening really. Unfortunately it's never going to change, ultimately it is only going to get worse. 

As governments the world over have shown big business owns legislation to ensure they continue to make squillions of profit unimpeded. 




 That's.. Awful. 




 I know right!? Something is a bit smelly with the whole affair. 




 you needed a /s there! :P But yes, that's basically their thought process. 




 lol, no.. 




 It's the impact to the image of the company they represent that the company are worrying about.

For instance an older person might hear a rumour that 2 married employees have an affair and will choose to take their business elseware. A younger person however would go "whatever." so given this is an insurance company, they will be looking at the age etc of their clientele to determine whether this is enough to make people not use them. 

Of course the other side of the coin is that the company may realise (perhaps after an analysis from a PR agency which I daresay is already happening) that they in fact gained from their employees indiscretion and may allow them to keep their jobs.  




 Personally, I still do, but the wife went to Whittakers long ago. 
They still have a humungous following regardless of their piss poor business choices. 

Then again in NZ there's only a duopoly - Whittakers and Cadbury. 




 They got lax. They released bad business decision - changes to their product - after bad decision with no mea-culpa it's all "To protect our increasing profits." 




 Haha, I tried last night. However surely someone can find it!? 




 Judging by some of the commentators it was at least 30 minutes, so there's that. 




 Indeed. 

What's the easiest way to lessen the blow of any change in their core product - give away free shit.

Where's the free shit Cadbury!? 




 Right, which makes the profit, coupled with this announcement all the more brutal. 




 Ha-de-ha. You think this isn't part of what's going to happen in your part of the world too? 




 I have to wonder if the marketing genius's at Cadburys saw how well the announcement went down for Whittakers and presumed they could pull the same stunt? 




 Also (I don't know how much Australian choco makes it to NZ shores) but the Aus arm of Cadbury posted a humungous profit last year -

**CHOCOLATE maker Cadbury recorded a $127 million profit in the year Prime Minister Tony Abbott promised the company a $16 million grant to revive factory tours.**
[Source](http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/profit-blots-blots-cadbury-aid/story-fnj4f7k1-1226978294004)
 




 And Aussie too...... They forgot the NZ public have memory like elephants, companies are not easily forgiven for messing with an iconic product! 














 If I find it I'll post it!

 True. Although if true you have to spare a thought for their families... what a time. 




 Just their building, not their employees as I understand. But yes, free publicity regardless! 
 




 Oh. dear....... God this gets worse and worse for them.. 




 It was harmless until the name of the company was released, by the company. As mentioned earlier, they may have made it worse for themselves a bit. 




 You're probably not even half wrong...... 




 Perhaps, we can but wonder really. Probably bystander effect too, everyone else thought everyone else would do something. (if you get what I mean?) 




 lol, they hopefully won't, the whole flying the corporate team into CHCH for damage control seems a bit overkill though. 




 Actually, really good point. In this day and age sometimes a good denial and complete media silence is the best policy. 




 A comment on the article would lead you to believe the guy did. Worst possible way to be caught if that is the case..  




 If it was the second floor as mentioned earlier, can't exactly knock on the window.. 




 It's not that they were having sex, it's having sex with the lights on beside a busy pub. 

Bear in mind cellphone camera's aren't the best low-light cameras, so for the some of the clips to be such good quality one can only presume they were lit up like a xmas tree.  




 Haha, fair call.. 




 Ah, thank you for the clarification. 

Still clearly (judging by the photos) visible to outside though..  




 I'm sure they'll be somewhere in imgur.. I would search but on a work machine. :D 




 You feel sorry for them, but in the same breath, having the lights on at street level.. You have to wonder if it was deliberate (hence the 'caught'.)

I also really hope it was all above board, and wasn't an affair, that's perhaps the worst way for an affair to come to light.. 














 Very true. 
























 As we live in a 'destination' area usually frequented by locals and visitors this aroused by suspicions a bit.

Mindful the neighbours car was broken in to a couple weeks back  I rang local police to report the van in case. They offered some friendly advice which in retrospect seemed obvious - just go and talk to them? 

So I went out, had a quick chat. It was an Asian couple, they spoke very broken English but the gist of it was they had just arrived in NZ, and were going on a long trip and wanted to make sure they were comfortable driving with the new car, and were used to driving on our roads before they headed off! They kept repeating "Safety!".

I thought it was very nice of them to take the responsibility so seriously. 

I just wanted to share this with you all to highlight the vast majority of tourists are responsible on our roads, it's just the incompetent arrogant few who ruin it for the many. 









 Yeah, a con artists who has set up a grant to inspire young inventers.. [What a total wanker.](http://www.jamesdysonfoundation.com/) /s 




 Jesus, little wonder you guys have no faith in your police or judicial system. Really can't blame you when they don't even give you a choice like this. 




 Your police and bureaucracy really really suck shit. I guess we should appreciate what we have in nz then. Appreciate your comment to help me gain some insight. 




 That is some fucked up shit. Ok, I understand where you're coming from, but they're looking for a reason to target you. By obeying the law you're rendering them toothless, powerless to stop you. Isn't that kinda empowering in its own right?  




 Why? For the record I'm from NZ, so this kind of shit very rarely happens here, we have a very different attitude to our police force (at this stage.) so please help me understand?

 




 Fucking beautiful. 

Their critique was cringeful to watch, it was an unabashed insult laden chastising that was uncalled for. Then **to insinuate he could be a mass murderer because of the fact he took pride in his appearance and you think he wanted to dress like  you**??? That's just makes you look like an arrogant fucktard.

Fuck the guy was there to sing, not to be judged for (what I though) was a spiffy looking suit.

He took pride in his appearance, they have no fucking right to put him down because he actually took the effort to look good. 

I honestly couldn't watch their foul mouthed display, I felt ashamed for the guy, on the upside, what a fucking gentleman, stood there and completely took it like a champion without a word of retort. 




 Fucking Americans.

A deranged mental idiot uses any gun he can get his hands on shoot a lot of people..

The gun company didn't give her the gun? I presume they didn't tell her to leave the gun out? I also presume they didn't tell the guy to use their gun? No????? So how the FUCK are they being held liable?!?!  




 Here's a novel idea, don't give the fucking police a REASON to arrest you, and they WON'T arrest you!?

Firstly: 100 people marching with purpose through a city can cause a lot of traffic mayhem.

Secondly: it's fucking expensive to hold up traffic, to get diversions in place and have a police stop the cars because I'm sure they reallllly don't want some impatient git flooring it through the middle of the crowd.

Thirdly: you're protesting against police, which is already getting their hackles up, don't provoke them by breaking the law. Just no. 




 Because (and yes, i'm going to shamelessly paraphrase you here.) Everyone wants to justify sinking a grand's worth of wages into their shiny new toy. 

Judging by the comments on a lot of posts, we have an awful lot of HTC and LG phone owners who frequent /r/Android (Jesus, should have seen when the G3 was rated best phone by the MWC, the mods were cleaning the semen off the floor for days, it was a major circlejerk.) and when the competition does something better they naturally want to bag it to make themselves feel better. Human nature I suppose. 




 That is true. 




 OP, after lurking in /r/android for a few months now, you have a lot to prove as the vast majority here really love bagging Samsung the first chance they get.

I love the figures, but when you have the first decent review:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/2yyftj/samsung_galaxy_s6_review_subject_zero/
And the top comment is "Worse battery than last years by a bit. But unless the M9 can blow me away with battery (which in all honesty I expect it to), I still think my next phone will be the S6 ^Edge?"

You're pushing shit uphill trying to impress most of the trolls here that Samsung can produce a good, well rounded device. 
I do admire your effort though!
 




 Interesting to note, however it's almost laughable my year and a half old phone will get to taste lollipop sooner than the newer phone I got 2 months ago..
 




 Just let Darwinism sort them out. 









 Indeed. 

A few select flagship varieties were upgraded first for influential markets to ensure people still bought the device, knowing it was going to be upgraded, however for the markets that they don't think people will buy a phone based upon the latest OS (smaller countries like NZ) they didn't bother releasing the latest ROM for.

(There's a website called "geekzone.co.nz" which allows the tech geeks from Vodafone/Telecom/2Degrees to chat with the users, and they've confirmed as of Feb they haven't even seen the latest Lollipop ROM for any S5's yet. 

So Samsung aren't just scattering them once they've been approved, they're not even bothering to release them to be tested by local carriers. 

Preeeety frustrating. 




 Fucking Censorship.  




 They've upgraded more of the very limited market S4 - i9506 devices to 5.0.1 (about 6 markets last I looked) than they have of my flavour of S5 - G900i (Just fucking 1 market.) So yes. Samsung are so unreliable with lollipop. 




 I love the first line " * Your old warranty is now void." yeah.. like you'd still have a warranty on a 5 year old phone :P 









 A little better than s4, but not by much, biggest benefit is water resistance. 
Camera is not that much better, fingerprint scanner is really awful, heart rate monitor is a piece of shit.  




 Interesting, thanks for clearing it was up. 









 That's kinda fascinating, any idea she was possible of this?  




 It's pretty fucked up. 

There are kinda two things you have to no morals to fuck with: charities and cancer. 









 But the s5 has the proprietary iso cell camera module making it more perplexing why they're shafting their customers.
 









 As an s5 owner all I really hope is they enable "pro shooting mode"on the S5 too, because ignoring the camera2 Api on the s5 lollipop and then releasing this feels like they're kneecapping the camera to make the s6 more appealing to camera enthusiasts. 




 Then I would say it's probably not a genuine screen, and if possible place it size by side with a genuine amoled, s3-s5 you'll quickly notice the difference. 

Also check out your screen options, you may have it on cinema, change it to dynamic?  




 Did you replace it with a cheap third party or genuine screen?  














 Could they suck from Samsung's teat any harder? Seriously.. 




 Good Night Sweet Prince. 




 That also works 




 They have their laws, we have ours. What I was attempting to draw is the fact that the laws are quite disparate despite the same crime. 




 Maybe a little. 




 FUCK NO. More highlighting the completely different approach the different countries have.
Yes, the amounts were significantly different, but this women was a repeat offender, and got off very lightly. 

Then when you compare to do something similar in Indonesia and the comparison is pretty fucked up. 




 Is there a reference I'm missing? 




 Same crime, but completely different attitudes. It's posted as a reflection to how out of whack the laws are. 









 Fucking racist cunts.  




 This is true. There's a final moral line between sucking off the ego of the device manufacturer, and providing an accurate and fair assessment of the device. 

Most review websites fail this moral test, and lean towards the former, and as you said - ensuring a steady and good income due to relieving further devices, not matter how many people they piss off due to them using their ego wank review as the basis to buy their next shiny toy, and then find out that actually the review didn't mention this fatal flaw which actually makes it a piece of shit.... 




 Thanks, just read the review. Most honest review I've read in a while, I loved how they specifically picked up on the awful screen which also plagued the original Flex device.

The funny (!) thing is I was utterly slammed on /r/android for picking this up on an early review of the G Glex2 after a youtube pre-release benchmark was released. I insinuated it was not an accurate test due to only running 1 benchmark at a time (and unknown cool down period between) and people left more than a couple of unsavory comments as a resut, so I think there are more than a few people who just don't want to know the truth sadly, and the review websites are pandering to this. 




 Right, I believe you, but no-one mentioned this on any reviews I saw, which makes sense as if I were Qualcomm I'd be careful curating news as well.  




 Reviews. Performance wise, it's not stellar, but reviews have not mentioned overheating. (Or none I have read anyway.)

If Samsung, Sony are having/had issues why is LG able to pump it a legitimate phone toting the 810 chip. Either the reviews experienced some serious heat issues and stayed quiet, or the issue isn't as big as everyone is making out to be? 

Don't get me wrong, I hate LG, but if they can make this SoC work, why can't anyone else?  




 How can the LG g flex do so well without overheating then?  




 Holy shit the Verge are like love sick puppies with their nose shoved so far up Apples ass they eat at the same time. This line made me fucking sick:

"Thats the same approach that Apple took when it expanded its iPhone lineup last year with some long overdue larger devices, and the ***payoff for that move was the biggest sales success in corporate history.***" 




 Can we stop calling her stupid?

I don't think she thought at all, you can't apply rational thought to someone in that scenario to be honest, your adrenaline takes over. Judge her all you like, but we have the benefit of hindsight. 




 Why would they bother? 

Pharmaceutical companies have squillions of dollars to fight any legislation and even go so far as to actively inventiveness doctors subscribing needless amounts of medication. 

I'm not saying it's not a problem, but it's just not worth it -not in the current political climate anyway. 




 Admittedly they've had some bad fucking luck, but surely shit like this should be picked up by routine checks? 

Any aircraft engineers care to weigh in? 




 Fucking cunt bag mother fuckers. NZ misses out again. Fuck you Google. you Magnificent fucking cunts. 




 I have to wonder how many parts of Android that most users never see, and never appreciate. For instance the (other than default) lock animations, or features they never knew existed like Face unlocking.

Has anyone ever seen you use your phone and gone WOW! and you've shown them their phone can do it too? 









 Don't know.. Nothing came up via Google, but you may honestly have to ask a Japanese historian. 









 HTC are barely treading water in the mobile market. Only so many people want a certain type of device.

Samsung have realised this, and done a more shot-gun approach of have a device for every piece, none particularly great, but adequate. This failed when their flag ship's sales weren't great. 

Oppo/One Plus have gone for cheap but good market, which is serving them well so far.

HTC have gone for the same market, 3 years running. You can only satisfy so many people in the world with 1 thing, before people start asking for alternatives.

Yes, their design **was** great, and won awards, but if they want to survive they either need Apple's iSheep affect to help the same thing, or they need to adapt.

They have not adapted by upgrading the Internal's, as one commenter on here mentioned, his 2 year old M7 is still more than adequate due to the chipset, so upgrading the internals is not adapting, as this isn't a very marketable changed this only serves to illustrate my point they have failed to innovate by upgrading their chipset with the same externals!

I mean people are arguing with me - saying that the people who bought their old device complained about certain features, which were then changes. 

So are you telling me HTC are marketing to the same people who buy their old devices? Again, they're going to/have already hit market saturation in some areas, so I was looking for some diversification from their design, or at least a better enhancement than a purely under the hood modification.  




 You're missing the point. But very well. 




 But I want an HTC with options.. In NZ the Mini isn't stocked by any major retail outlets, our options here are either a mid-range Desire, or the One. 

You're saying if you want a larger screen, go for a different manufacturer, from a marketability point of view that's an appalling attitude - we're not going to cater FOR any other market, other than the one we're been catering to for 3 years now. 

... Yeah, cause that's a sound business model. 




 I'm not arguing it was once a beautiful piece of kit, however consumers needs and demands change a lot over 3 years. As they don't release many other models (and certainly those don't tend to go to the same markets as the one does, they are making up consumers minds for them by saying this is the only screen size you need. Or this is the only design of phone you should ever want. 


That is arrogant. And as I mentioned, design awards aside people slammed Samsung for "evolution over revolution" with their devices, yet praise HTC for doing the same damn thing year after year? 

The review websites are very carefully avoiding mentioning the design copy paste. It's fucking hypocritical to the max and I'm so over the tall poppy syndrome. 

You tell me you aren't disappointed the same designers who made the original m7 have failed to improve upon their design in ***any way shape or form?*** 




 But  




 They've at least done consumers  a favor by increasing the screen size and pixel density for goodness sake! HTC have been arrogant shits and stubbornly kept the same size, same pixel density!  




 All I have to say: **it's the same fucking phone design for 3 fucking years!** 

***3 God damn years!***


That's just lazy and shitty. 




 I would argue, citing Samsung and Sony as two prime culprits who have done this - produced very similar looking devices year after year and they have subsequently had their mobile divisions post significant losses.

As the pundits loved to say about the S5 - "Evolution over Revolution" simply isn't enough to stay relevant in today's fast paced mobile industry.

A good example of this is Samsung - they are rapidly faced with losing their (once lion's) share of Android sales. 

Should your logic ring true the sames of the S5 was released with no major cosmetic changes (argueable of course) over the S4, sales tanked.

As a result, faced with a do or die situation (which may be overstating it..) they have done a complete about turn on two things which were once elemental to their design ethos - SD card and removable back panel.

People may have no design changes presented to them, however the market has shown it will not stand for it, and no manufacturer is totally immune from public opinion swaying against them if they feel like said manufacturer is merely using their brand name as a means to sell products. 

Of course I'd have to be a blind idiot to not realise it's not a significant part of the consumers purchasing decision. However, this is not, and I doubt ever will be the ultimate reason people chose 1 device over the other.

As a result they need a "catch" a reason to say "I'm going with manufacturer XYZ because I like their design ***and this new feature*** is what is making me buy their product.

HTC have unfortunately fallen into this, thinking they can get away with people buying their product purely because they're HTC. Correct me if I am wrong, but by producing the (mostly) ~~identical~~ same product for 3 years in a row is most certainly them telling the consumers "You don't need that extra special feature because ***I, HTC*** have made this."

As I mentioned earlier the only company who could pull this off is Apple. And HTC are as far from Apple as chalk and cheese.

However, if you have examples where you believe this may work, I am more than open for a good discussion! :)  




 For those supporting the move - the Snapdragon 615 is shat on by the 801.

[See GSMArena's review of the HTC Desire 820](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_desire_820_dual_sim-review-1198p5.php)

Antutu: 27070 
vs E8  (Snapdragon 801) 46857

Yeah.. They are so utterly kneecapping the M8. There's no if, buts or maybe's.
 









 Actually he's quite correct - in NZ at least in Oct 2013 when the 5C and 5S were released. 
Facts and source below.

The iPhone5 was $800.

 Severely disappointed it's not an ISOCELL sensor, but clearly that either was a gimmick, or wasn't ready for version.2 in time?

Also such additions as motion tracking autofocus is extremely awesome.
 




 HTC are basically admitting they're fucking useless and suck ass at innovating, so they have to cheat by kneecapping their old phone in order to sell the new one.

They are admitting there's little reason for people to upgrade otherwise, and it's the fucking losers option to destroy the competition (their old phone) rather than produce a device which they know will sell on it's own merits. Because it won't, because it's a fucking clone of the previous 2 versions before it.

And furthermore, EVERYONE fucking bagged on Samsung for "evolution rather than revolution" with their S5 product, but HTC have done it for 3 years in a row, and everyone thinks they're fucking Gods. 

The phone industry are a bunch of fucking hypocrites with a severe case of tall poppy syndrome. 

This is what you've all created: The retarded child in the family who won't amount to anything because everyone keeps telling them they're doing a good job rather than telling them to do better. 




 Exactly, even they weren't stupid enough to think they could get away with the same shit. Again, HTC do it, and people think it's the best thing since sliced bread. I mean where the fuck is innovation? Innovation isn't using the damn processor as everyone else. Or using the same fucking camera sensor as everyone else, it's putting up new ideas, and actually standing by the choices you make. 

As HTC have shown however they are not innovators, they are fucking sheep who don't even have the balls to work on their ultra-pixel camera. And everyone is actually congratulating them for this phone!? And looking forward to it!?! The same crowd who called for Samsung's blood for daring to release the S5 which was "too similar to the S4" and yet here we have the SAME PHONE 3 years in a god damn row!

/rant./ 




 But everyone slammed Samsung for making a phone that remotely looked like the predecessor, however HTC do it and everything thinks it's God gift to the world. Fucking hypocrites.  




 Let's be honest here, most people already have a perfectly functional device, it's the WOW factor that makes people crave the latest.

Makers are slowly realizing they need a "Buy This MotherFucking Phone, It Will Make All The Girls Panties Drop at the mere site of your awesomeness."

One needn't look any further than Samsung thinking they could get away with largely a "Me too" phone with their Samsung S5. Not even ~~waterproofing~~ water resistance or a dodgy heart rate monitor could help the fact that the phone largely feels like a S4 in your hand. 

Potential owners need a flash factor, something that makes people go: "Wow, what's that phone?" It makes them feel good, and helps to avoid buyers regret.

However HTC have missed the boat entirely. If customers want a good HTC phone, they could very easily go with the M8 and not miss anything from the new version.

Put it this way: 

Your contract is up, you walk into TMobile, and go excellent, I can get a new phone!

How a layman sees it while looking at what phone to buy:

**Screen:**

* M7: 4.7 FHD

* M8: 4.7 FHD

* M9: 4.7 FHD

**Design:**

* M7: Aluminum unibody

* M8: Aluminum unibody

* M9: Aluminum unibody

**Operating system:**

* M7: Lollipop

* M8: Lollipop

* M9: Lollipop

**Speakers:**

* M7: Front Stereo

* M8: Front Stereo

* M9: Front Stereo

**Camera:** 

* M7: Takes photos

* M8: Takes photos

* M9: Takes photos

Why would you walk out of that store with a phone that looks and feels just like the 2 year old phone sitting next to it?.. 

Most people won't - they will turn to the Samsung for a larger screen, or Sony or Samsung for ~~waterproof~~ water resistance, or Huawei for a cheapie to tide them over. 

There's just no justification why most people with last year (or the year before) should upgrade to this model. 

Don't get me wrong, people will buy it, but there's zero WOW factor, and this will cost HTC sales to their competitors. 




 Yes. I thought it was so obvious I didn't bother putting /s. However I was wrong. 




 Very true. 

They really couldn't afford to rest on their laurels this year, and they don't have the Apple Effect^ to pump out a "S" version and think people will buy the new thing.

Same screen size as M8, same exterior as M8, same speakers (indifferent to most users) as M8, same interface with Lollipop as M8.. 

The users aren't going to notice (largely) a 'beneath the hood' CPU/GPU or RAM upgrade, as most aren't power users who benefit from alt+tabbing.

They needed to make current M7/M8 owners jealous, they have not succeeded.
 




 Samsung are losing significant market share in China and they can't afford to:

 Upvoted for the good memory. :) 




 I noticed the complete lack of OIS has been glossed over by bloody everyone.

As Sammy proved, even with a redesigned sensor (ISOCELL) you still need OIS backing it up for lowlight photos. It's a no brainer. 




 [This (and other sources)](http://www.amta.org.au/articles/amta/Brazil.Russia.India.and.China.emerging.middleclass.drives.extreme.mobiles.growth) show China as a new emerging market which isn't near saturation point for mobile growth yet. As a result Sammy have heavily leaned on Asian design culture for the S6 in a unbridled effort to grasp some of that newly available cash. 




 The West are a very well saturated market, the current expanding market is China. As a result they're pandering for an asian design taste rather than Western design taste. 




 the S5 has a fucking awful fingerprint scanner. How this got past quality assurance in the first place remains a mystery. 




 I think Apple are also eagerly licking their lips in preperation for the "looks like an iPhone6" law suits.. 




 I think a lot of people (Especially S5 owners) are feeling fucking jipped right now that Samsung COULD have pumped out something like this earlier, but didn't.
 




 Jesus. When he zooms in the quality looks like a hundred dollar point and shoot. 




 I have an s5 after a fortuitous insurance event after an s5 and can happily say they are so fucking alike it's not hard to see why sales tanked fucking hard. 

A better screen? No. 

Better battery? No, same screen on time. 

Better feel? No fucking creaky back panel. 

Better features? Fuck no! Unreliable heart rate monitor, and still too nervous to put anything worth a grand in a pool of water! 

Better phone? Fuck no. Not in any way shape or form. (And I used the s4 for a year for over 6 hours a day every day, so I'm more than an average user and if I cannot really justify this, can't expect most of your average Joe's to do so. 




 Eli5 why does north Korea come across as fucking crazy to westerners. Is their leader fucking nuts, or is there method to his madness?  




 They're like fucking children. No! I don't want anyone else playing with my things! Grow up.  




 We're so fucked. 




 Samsung unfortunately have a lot riding on this. But I fear they've done too much to please those who buy other phones regardless and bag on the Samsung brand than those who are actually loyal to them. 

Tl;dr pleasing the haters only to alienate your core fans = stupid stupid stupid. 




 Thanks, good tips.

My warranty forbids rooting unfortunately so I have to stick with the auto-adjust (which I only need to over-ride when showing old people photos!) black/dark backgrounds, and now using the night theme for Reddit Synch. 




 Yeah, suprising. Still one of the best resources though, obviously not something many people know enough or want to write about. 




 This does interest me, there's scant information real world available to layman who just wants to save a little bit of battery. 

I have an S5 and before than an S4, and on both devices struggling to hit more than 4 hours SOT. I would love to hit more without the need to resort to powersaving. (Where's the point in having a Ferrari while driving it like nanna?!) 




 Well, you don't have to change your wallpaper, to make a small change but still save significant amounts you could change your keyboard theme to a darker one instance 




 It's more small changes can make a big difference. I've changed the theme of Swype to "midnight" to be more dark as in working to get more than 4 hours screen on time on my s5.

Also just downloaded Reddit sync with an amoled dark theme, going to see if that helps. 









 I should also add have you tried scratching the contacts of your battery terminals?

Just with like a pin/knife gently scrape the 'knuckles' of the phonebattery terminals and the battery terminal pads themselves. 




 Just want to say it's nice to have an /r/galaxys4 "please help" post where the OP actually responds to questions! 




 So basically the greedy sons of bitches got told to fuck off? 




 Update: Sports mode has made a significant difference! Thanks /u//Bedk for the suggestion! 









 It's like a leprechaun is pissing on your hand. 









 I agree, and as mentioned I've got a d7000 50mm 18- 140mm however the best camera is the one you have on you at the time! I'll try fv5. Thanks!  









 I think outta around 80/20% 

80 = locals.. But they're targeted by campaigns constantly telling them they're driving like idiots.  




 Awesome! I'll just use sports mode from now. Thanks man, simple fix..  




 Good point, we really don't have the funding/money full stop to afford extra manpower/equipment etc to do this. 




 Yeah.. A bit!  




 Perhaps. I did in rarotonga, took 15 mins, happy to do it again. 




 Makes sense. To plead arrogance to such an infamous icon is a tad weird though.
 




 Couldn't agree more. I recently went to Dunedin, most of the trip was alright, but we got a lot of 130km/h in passing lanes, 80 every other time.. Dangerous overtaking etc.  




 You could find extremes like this in every scenario, regardless of whether they're a kiwi or not. 

Foreigners are however quite bad down south in comparison to the rest of the country. I can't recall stats, but they're not great. 

We have ad campaigns targeting our bad drivers, drink drivers, stoned drivers, tired drivers and angry drivers, but there's very little in the form of foreign driver campaigns. (They're are recently putting some in place, but I don't think it's widely advertised enough). 




 You misunderstand my statement, I mean we have no idea how they got their license, no idea if they walked into the testing station, drove around the block and were handed a license. 




 Why is that? The police/government are such hypocritical pricks.

They say "Driving is a privilege not a right." 

But then argue "You passed a potentially arbitrary driving test in a completely foreign country, with rather different road laws to New Zealand but yeah, of course you absolutely have the right to drive on NZ roads." 




 I saw that.. My heart goes out. I've driven that road recently, they would not have stood a snow balls chance in hell of avoiding a collision, and now that driver has to live with the fact he was in control of the wheel when that poor girl died. Just fucking tragic. 




 Thank you for providing some context to their actions. That's crazy.... 









 No, we should keep helping out elsewhere - like peacekeeping efforts to allow other countries to focus on ISIS etc. 




 Million (trillion?) dollar question. 




 Thank you for the suggestion It's not preinstalled, but I'll grab it from the Samsung store and just leave it in that mode 




 Sorry, yes, damn I should have picked that up. 




 Thank you, to the layman like me this didn't make sense, but your explanation provides sound reasoning. 




 Good point.  




 Pretty much this.

I talked to someone recently who'd read the Koran and he realised how utterly futile it is to try and reason with them, so what can you do? 

Can't kill an ideology, you can't reason with it and you can't change their beliefs. I don't think most people get this. 



















 I'm not envious of ARS at the moment, they have the unenviable moral dilemma of raising the profile of this, at the same time as letting potential attackers know who otherwise wouldn't have bothered/thought about using this to their advantage.  




 Hi /r/Android I just basically want to try and understand why Samsung have a hard-on for using rediculously low expsosure times on a hand-held camera.

I have a 6mth old child, so naturally he's always moving, and as I've recently upgraded to a Galaxy S5 over an S4 I was really looking forward to taking semi-decent quick exposure photos.

I've been horribly disappointed that basically the bloody camera defaults to an (obscenely low)1/33 for EVERY scenario and just alters to ISO to cope, except for extremely bright scenarios!

To back this claim up I've gone through my photos and summarized the settings the camera chose:

* In a well lit pool environment (Shutter 1/33 ISO250), 

* In a zoo on a sunny day (Shutter 1/33-1/110 ISO40-80), 

* At home with good natural light (Shutter: **1/17-1/20** ISO 320-100) 

* And out and about (Shutter **1/15** ISO400)

Even with an APS-C sensor D7000 with 50mm F2.2 fails to take decent photos at 1/17 hand held for goodness sake! And coupled with Samsung's utterly bullshit excuse for *software image stabilization* you just cannot use the damn camera for any sort of even partially low-light scenario with even slow moving objects!

To make matters worst I've taken photos with the iPhone5S and iPhone6 and noticed that..

* They take higher ISO photos.

* They have vastly superior software image stabilsation.

After having used the S4 *(which I usually didn't even bother to try and take quick photos on as it barely focus in anything other than perfect burn-your-retina bright sunlight)* for a year, I'm really disappointed in Samsung for doing very very little in the image stabilization department, I had hoped they would utilise the ISOCELL sensor to increase the shutter priority and allow for higher ISO's but this is simply not the case.

I will concede the focusing accuracy, especially in low-light is 99% better, but this is useless if you can focus on your item, but the resulting photos is ruined by the smallest quiver of your hand!

I'm stuck with the damn thing for now, but I just hope them to open the camera API and allow me to use smarter camera software to set higher shutter speed's or at least higher ISO's! 

**(It would appear the arrogant fuckheads have chosen to ignore the new API with Lollipop for now)**

Is there anything I should be doing differently? 

Is there a better Android camera fullstop which will produce faster photos? 

What do you think, am I just being a whiny little bitch? 




 Pulse was good until they decided LinkedIn was an awesome partner and changed the GUI dramatically and made a perfectly functional application into a an utter dog.

Took them many months to recover from that.
