 I have always gotten auditory hallucinations when I'm falling asleep, whether I'm sober, on kratom or on dope. Sometimes they startle me lol. But that's how I know I'm finally falling asleep. 




 I think you meant to reply to the comment above me. But yeah, I agree. HS is the shit. 




 Where do you go? 




 TIL Valium grows in the ground. 




 I went to the optometrist after a 4 day crank bender one time. He says to me, he says "Holy cow! Your pupils are huge! I don't even need to use the dilation solution!". So I says to him, I says "Yeah, I forgot to take my Klonopin this morning!". And so he says to me, he says "Oh. OK." Afterward I went out to my Jeep and my buddy (who was waiting in the car) has my hood popped and all my doors open, scouring the whip with a washcloth. I says to him, I says "God damn Robby, you hit the shit again, didn't ya?" And he says to me, he says "Yup. You were taking forever". 

I was only in there for like 20 minutes. That brother got issues. 




 I had the same problem for a long time. Now I chase every burn with a half a glass of ginger ale and I don't have the problem anymore. 




 HS for sure. I go 2:1 RVS to Bali. I buy 50 bucks worth total (shipped) and it lasts me around 10-14 days. Obviously I still have 50% of the Bali left after the RVS is gone, so then I go $25 on just the RVS to get me through the next 10-14 days. 




 It's... somethin special. Got me ready to take on the day today, boy. 




 But if I had to choose 1, it'd be Bali. Red Vein Sumatran doesn't do too much for me by itself. 




 I actually combine RVS and Bali 2:1 for every dose. It's the fucking best, ever. 




 BALLLIIIIIIIII 




 This was a wonderful post.  




 Coffee gives me anxiety, but the last 3 times I drank it, the reaction I got was so bad that there's nothing worth going through that again. Coffee can go fuck itself. I was having like tremors, couldn't even hold my head and eyes straight ahead without my head shaking, hands felt detached, and I just felt like shit. It almost felt like dehydration or something but I POUND water all DAY my nigger so IDK, 




 Wait.... there's kratom on Amazon?
And There's such a thing as a Canadian Amazon? 
 




 Yeah I almost panicked a little when all that happened. I'm comfortable with them and the strains I get from them. Would not like to have to shop around. 




 Fuck yeah 




 I always go Herbal Salvation 




 If you're a hardcore kratom aficionado, you manned that shit down and you liked it. 




 Once I got like 95 Dilaudid 4's and I shot them all with my girlfriend over the course of like 60 hours. I didn't shit for maybe two days, and i didn't think anything of it because I was always doing meth and not shitting a whole lot anyways. Well, on the third day, I suddenly had to shit. It didn't feel crazy or anything, just the normal bowel movement feelings. I went and got on the toilet and I pushed and it felt like the fat end of a bowling pin was trying to squeeze out my asshole. I pushed and pushed and it got just to the point where I couldn't just pull my pants up and get laxative and wait, cuz it was too far out, but at the same time it was still not coming out at all. I tried picking at it, but the way it was shaped it just didn't do any good. After 67 minutes of straight pushing on the toilet, sweatin my balls off, it finally came out. I have never experienced such a relief as I did that day, in that moment. I was so happy, the whole time I was pushing all I could think about were all the times I wasn't constipated that I took for granted. It was really a glorious one. It was shaped like a football and it was easily the widest I've ever had. I almost wanted to weigh it. But yeah so I know what you mean by bein so desperate you want to pick at it. 
 




 Bagel with cream cheese for breakfast, random meals with meat for lunch and usually either ham or turkey sandwiches on rye bread for dinner. Some bowls of granola cereal thrown in here and there. I drink probably 3 liters of water a day. No coffee. Do drink juice. Just copped magnesium citrate and stool softener. 




 Shut the fuck up 




 I got some. Thanks. 




 It would but it gives me wicked anxiety so I don't drink it. Sucks cuz I love it. 




 Well. I can eat Bali all day and not get bound up at all. But as soon as the Sumatran comes into play, I'm bound up. So I'm not thinkin it's so much the plant matter as it is just the effects of a certain strain... For me, anyways. 




 I bought some magnesium citrate caps and some stool softener without the stimulant laxative. I'm gonna use both the magnesium and the stool softener for now and see if I can clean myself out a little and then I'll see if just the magnesium does the trick. Thanks for the input. 




 I take Green Bali and Red Vein Sumatran twice a day, about 6-8 grams total. The Bali doesn't block me up, but the Sumatran does. Most of the time I manage to squeeze one or two small bowel movements a day, but it's common for me to go a few days without having one. It always comes around the third day, but this is obviously not a comfortable schedule. What does everybody recommend to take in order to regulate my bowl movements? I have no plans of dropping the kratom as a whole, or the Red Vein Sumatran, for that matter. 




 P.S.  your user name is awesome 




 This thread is retarded. This is the type of shit you don't want lawmakers to see. 




 What strain(s) do you use? 




 I go 2-3 grams of Red Vein Sumatran to 1-1.5 grams of Green Bali chased with a little ginger ale to (successfully) counteract nausea. I do it at 7 am and then again around 5-6 pm. I think your best way of cutting back would be to stop cold turkey for a few days and then continue at a lower dose, because lowering your dose without clearing your system out might lead to disappointing effect.

I love kratom. It's the shit. 




 Just toss it in a little bit of applesauce and then you can swallow it whole. That's what I used to do with shrooms. But I would try to keep the amount of applesauce as minimal as possible. 




 I would just take some on the flight but I would also send some through the mail to your destination in case they take it on the flight. 




 I feel like you maybe ought to tackle one thing at a time. That's what counselors suggest and I can see why they do... like maybe start taking kratom first in lieu of alcohol, since I'm pretty sure that's probably your biggest problem. After a few months of stability, then you should try substitution for the caffeine and nicotine. 

That's just my opinion. I understand why they tell you to do it that way... quitting alcohol, cigs and caffeine all at once seems like it could possibly be disastrous before long. Then again, kratom does some wonderful things. Just my 2 cents. 




 I smoked weed for a few years and then got hooked on opiates. I did them both together for a long time, but then whenever I would smoke weed without being high on opiates, I would get absolutely horrible anxiety. I just ended up quitting weed completely, because it doesn't appeal to me any more... but that sounds kinda the same as you're experiencing. 




 WHO IS THIS FUCKIN GUY 




 Maeng Da makes me feel like I'm gonna die. I go two parts Red Vein Sumatran to one part Green Bali.. about 3-4 grams. It's super excellent. 




 Have some ginger ale on hand in case of nausea. 




 Yeah usually I don't bother responding to articles like that but it put me over the edge when he recommended a benzo. I also just couldn't believe all the comments absolutely bashing kratom. People abuse it in order to get high and then are somehow surprised it becomes a problem for them. I don't use it because I want to get high, I use it because I want to stay sober.

Congratulations on your clean time. 




 I chase every burn with a few gulps of ginger ale. I thought it was stupid when I first heard about it, but I tried it the first time and my nausea instantly was gone. Haven't gotten nauseous since. 




 Eastern US time. New to PS4 and BF4. 

PSN: crfw

Do have mic. 




 fuck yeah 




 I get it from Herbal Salvation. I get the Green Bali and the Red Vein Sumatran. I take it 2 parts RVS to 1 part Green Bali. I always dose the exact same amount and my tolerance hasn't changed.... but I've also learned to appreciate the subtle effects, I don't go into it looking to get blasted... although my morning one is always stupendous. 




 me too. 

psn: crfw

just got it and i don't even know anybody who owns a ps4 lol. i only play bf4. 




 There's so many nightmare-ish comments about kratom on that page that it's hard to believe they aren't loaded comments.  




 Pffffft. Swishing krat around my mouth is half the fun. It just wouldn't be the same if I went with caps. 




 Whoops. My apologies. 




 I've never even heard of this. 2 micrograms seems like a very small amount, since there's 2 milligrams in an 8 mg suboxone strip and that's hardly even really active at an oral dose. Wouldn't taking any amount of nalaxone with opiates just offset the opiate's affinity for the opiate receptors , so taking a small dose of nalaxone would be like taking a little less oxycodone than you actually ingested? Are you supposed to still feel the effects of the oxycodone when you make this combo, and still have your tolerance lowered at the same time? Confusing stuff. 




 Never mind. I'm sure it is. 




 Is it legal for me to sell it to somebody? 




 You scare me by taking 12-14g of Bali. 




 Bali and Maeng Da are really at opposite ends of the effects spectrum. If you liked the Bali then you should be looking into the more sedating strains. I personally combine Bali and Red Vein Sumatran, but I have 100 G's of Maeng Da just sitting here because I tried it and I hated it. Makes me all jittery and fuckin like twitchy and light headed and fucks with my muscles. Not fun. 




 So I got up today and dropped about 4.5 g of the green bali... 3 hours later I was at lunch with my family and the nausea was still bad enough that I didn't even wanna eat. I remembered you mentioned ginger ale, so I ordered some and bam.. gone instantly. I went to the store and copped some 2 liters and came back here for the second dose of the day with a ginger ale chaser and it's all fuckin good. Thanks a lot man (or woman). 




 I don't need to justify it. I shot heroin for 8 years and now I only do kratom. I think that says it all. 




 K, I literally just went and ordered 100 g's of Red Vein Sumatran from HS. Hopefully that solves the problem for me. Thanks. 




 The strain I use is actually Green Bali, it's the only one I've tried that I like... although the one I'm trying next is red vein Sumatran. I was told it's similar to Bali. 




 Tossing and washing literally does not even bother me. I could toss a spoon-full in my mouth dry and chew on it and throw some water in and swish it around and chew some more and just swallow it and it wouldn't even faze me. I'm 100% positive the nausea isn't from the tossing and washing. It may be from the powder itself in my stomach, maybe I need to use a tea, but if that's the case the capsules won't help anyway.  




 Really? You take it on a full stomach to prevent nausea? It works? 




 Sometimes I get nausea on a dose i barely even feel. 




 Alright, I'll give it a go. Thanks a lot. 




 Where from? I have anxiety too and I can't deal with anything speedy. 




 A vicious liquid? Is that like sulfuric acid or something? That stuff seems pretty vicious. 




 Do you mean the green bali from HS does that to you or all green bali does that to you? 




 Honestly, if I wasn't a recovering opiate addict, I'm not even sure I would notice the effects of kratom. They can be so subtle sometimes and I think people often think it's going to hit them like a ton of bricks.  




 THAT BROTHER WRECKED 




 I've been going with MmmS but i recently put in an order to HS after seeing all the glowing reports concerning HS on here. The estimated delivery was supposed to be today, but it hasn't even made it out of Idaho yet. WTF! Again, it's USPS's fault, not HS... it just sucks cuz I'm really looking forward to it lol. Hopefully it gets straightened out before I run out of my current supply. 




 I'LL BE BACK ON THE DIRTY D IN NO TIME 
























 I threw up on myself a couple years ago, the third time i ever tossed and washed. It was the last dose I owned and I was pissed. Ever since then I'm just more careful about it, and hasn't happened since.
 




 That's incredibly inaccurate. I prefer HS over Mmm, Speciosa all day. The quality IMO is better and it's way cheaper. 




 Cost isn't a huge factor? OH SHIT THIS NIGGA BALLIN 




 iOSPoundcake? 




 Wayward apostrophe's 




 Anal parachute 




 Well, you can OD on anything, technically. But you would have to eat a pretty god damn ridiculous amount of kratom to die from it. So accidental  overdoses aren't especially harmful with kratom, you can just throw up or lie down until it goes away. 




 You're a dirty nigger 




 What kratomkorner coupons? I don't know of any. 




 He's confusing shills with people who love their products, prices and service. I recommend them all the time. They just have a large following. I'm quite interested to see some concrete shillage though, if there is any. 




 I'll bet you a package of Monistat 7 that it's extremely relevant. 




 The other day I was feeling adventurous, so I decided to try a 3-way strain mixture. I went 2 grams of Red Vein Sumatran, 2 grams of Green Bali, and 2 grams of Red Vein Thai. About 45 minutes later, I was feeling pretty great, when I suddenly felt the need to shit. I went and got on the toilet and squeezed a good one out. However, I was still feeling quite adventurous, so I decided to wipe from back to front. I've always wiped from front to back, and I was just curious what it would be like to not have to lean off the seat to wipe... I could just reach down between my legs. Unfortunately, because of this, I ended up with a yeast infection on my nutsack. Do not recommend. 




 Phenibut and benzos don't have a cross-tolerance? Could that be why? IDK anything about phenibut. I used to be prescribed k-pins as well, i'd get 90 1 mg pills and i would blast through them in 5 days, which i never remembered. It's a horrible drug to be addicted to, and a dangerous one to get off of. 




 Does your tolerance not build when you take DXM? Can I get away with taking a really small dose of DXM? I really don't like the idea of using it every day though. 




 Looks like I better try this tomorrow. I can't seem to talk myself into a washout, unfortunately. 




 Try a different strain. Maeng Da makes me feel like shit. 




 I used to shoot heroin. The first time I ever took kratom, I took 7 grams. I don't know which strain, I didn't know enough about kratom at the time to care. I went from being dope sick to feeling ok in about 20 minutes, it was really quite noticeable. 

I didn't catch a buzz off it at all, I just felt normal again. That was the problem. I didn't want to just be ok, I wanted to be high. I took kratom a few more times at pretty high doses, and then just went back to the opiates.

It wasn't until I went back to prison this last time and got out, that I decided to give kratom a go again. This time it worked great, because I was at baseline as far as my tolerance was concerned. It filled the void I had in me. Even though I'd been sober for about 8 months (I'd used Suboxone in prison in the beginning of my bid) , I still just felt empty. So I gave it a shot and I haven't looked back since. It's been about 8 months. 

The problem is, when he's hooked like that, the mental aspect is half the battle. And having a plant that just keeps him feeling OK is just going to cover the physical side of things, it won't do much for the mental cravings. I would say his best bet would be to (somehow) get off the opiates for about a month and then start a kratom regimen... that way it does something for him both mentally and physically. Other than that, he could start a kratom regimen now and seek outpatient treatment and/or NA/AA for the mental side of things. I don't know. I hope this helps. 




 Call the ambulance right before you take it so they're there when you start to lose your shit. 




 That sounds detrimental to your health. Not the sort of thing you want to deal with long term, who knows what the effects could be. What about veins? Does it happen with red, green and white veins? 




 I can't make heads or tails of this comment. 




 Tomorrow, around noon. 




 Just slip a few grams into her soup and then she'll see the light. 




 Did you pay several hundo for it? Maybe it's heroin. Maybe those are heroin rocks. 




 You do this every day? I need to find a solid method myself. 




 I giggled at your comment. 




 The only green I touch is Bali, mixed with reds, and I haven't been getting any palpitations... so yeah, might be worth experimenting. I also have a history of heart palpitations and anxiety anyway, so I suppose the whites might exacerbate it. 




 What strain are you using? White veins and Maeng Da both give me heart palpitations, along with a plethora of other side effects. I've sworn them off. 




 4) Green stains are hell. Grass stains were always the bane of Mama's existence. 




 Be careful. 




 Tobacco: You may crave tobacco more when using kratom. I chew tobacco and I feel nothing extra after I chew, other than I'm always ready for another chaw as soon as I spit my last one out. Food: Always take kratom on an empty stomach, being full can minimize the effects greatly. Some claim eating a small meal 45 minutes after kratom ingestion can actually potentiate it. I've never witnessed it. Soda: Some also say caffeine increases kratom efficacy. Once again, I've never noticed it. 




 MAKE ME, DICK FACE 




 That brother can keep his ass over here. 




 100 mg oral morphine? Forget about it. Kratom is for people who want to maintain, not for people looking to get high. You'll never achieve that sort of feeling from kratom. Come back and give it a try when you're all strung out and out of options. Until then it's going to be pretty useless to you. Even if you take a heroic dose, the side effects will have you fucked up long before any sort of opioid feeling will. 




 It's really not even comparable to cannabis. If you're opioid naive, you can certainly get a high from it in the beginning. I've never smoked it but I've read reports that it's hardly even worth doing. I'd imagine you'd have to smoke a couple grams of it at once to achieve desired effect, although I'm not familiar with it at all. 




 It's apples and oranges. Kratom is the type of thing that might tempt you to indulge in it more often than you originally planned. I wouldn't recommend it if you're just trying to make your weed go longer. 




 I'll review as well. 




 Junk-Gnomes are sneaking in your room and shooting you with H right after you fall asleep. 




 That's who I think about while I fuck the sandwich. 




 I just saw your name and your comment and I immediately imagined what it'd be like to stick my dick in a vacuum cleaner hose that has a club sandwich jammed in the tip. 




 I have an Amazon gift card, was thinking of coppin some kratom myself but would be pissed if I wasn't happy with it. Best to not chance it I guess. 




 I'll notice he's gone. I'll notice how fuckin peaceful it is without his negativity. lol 




 Your mom choked to death on my wiener 




 I hate the taste of tea. 




 Sources: 
Herbal Salvation: Great value, my personal vendor****
MMM, Speciosa: Known to have highest quality, but you pay for it.******
Strains: Red Veins (Sumatran, Borneo, Thai, etc.) are best for sedation but I throw a little Green Bali in there to spice it up a notch. It seems to really potentiate the Red Veins, and it's not too speedy. Such combos are great for pain.  




 Good question. He's a dirty shill. 




 Ha. In reality, he's actually a boner consumer. 




 Awwww. Poor thing. 




 Only 77 dollars for 2 ounces. What a steal. 




 You guys could have at least posted a couple other times before dropping your shill post. This is just blatantly obvious and disrespectful to this sub and its subscribers. 




 Cop a sample pack and try them all, see which ones (or combinations) you like best and go from there. Use ginger if you get nausea. Use as little as possible. Get plain leaf, no extracts. Go several days cold turkey from your pain meds before you try kratom and the results will be much better than if you try to transition from one directly to another.  




 This is downright snazzy. Bravo. 




 A couple... When I pooped, my poop already had toilet paper in it. Also, I now own 5 less grams of kratom. 




 It really itched. Do not recommend.

 




 DAMN. THAT BROTHER ASTUTE. 




 Can you deliver to New York? I'll give you a handy-j. 




 Withdrawal from any sort of opioid gives me nightmares, if I can even manage to sleep. 




 WHERE'D IT GO? 




 YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 




 Robbed?

You nod from UEI? 




 Reminds me of people that think ecstasy is cut with heroin or coke. It just doesn't make any sense. Kratom vendors are going to synthesize methadone so they can lace their kratom with it? Sounds crazy.  Surely they wouldn't be using pharmaceutical methadone. That would be even crazier. They wouldn't be able to afford it. I would know for sure if there was methadone in my kratom, lol. I'd be ripped all day, rather than feeling good for a couple hours and then just feeling a glow the rest of the day. Tell ya what though... if somebody finds kratom with methadone in it, I want some. 




 Just jam a ball into your vein. Then you don't have to worry about coming down... ever. 




 Go for it. I chase every dose with ginger ale. If I don't, I get nausea. Ginger ale works really well though. I wouldn't be using kratom without it. I suggest you get some. 




 One time I wiped my ass from back to front and I got a yeast infection on my nutsack. 




 Even when it isn't the holidays, USPS screws up once in a while and loses a package in circulation anywhere from 1 to 10 days. It just happens. It's much more likely during the holidays. I'm sure it'll make it, but give it a week or two. If it never arrives, I imagine MS would replace it.  




 The only thing I understand in this post is MS. 




 I go 2:1 RVS to Green Bali. The RVS does hardly anything by itself, no matter how much I take. But that 1/3rd of Bali REALLY potentiates the RVS. It's the only way I roll. 
























 I don't care for your books.
 




 That combination has been known to cause uncontrollable cravings for wieners in the people who take it. 




 Well it would be one thing if it was a fresh leaf, but to put dry leaf in your mouth? Fuck that. 




 Brother.. you ain't gettin the tingle in your sacknuts? 




 Call their post office. If they aren't willing to hold it for you, UPS or FedEx will for sure.  




 Load a turkey baster up with hot butter. Get naked. Lay in fetal position. Insert turkey baster into bunghole. Have friend jump on bulb of turkey baster. Keep your mouth closed when he jumps on it so it doesn't fly out your throat. You're welcome. 




 Just mail it to your destination. 




 Well... As much as I love a good back and forth with a mentally retarded person, I'm gonna have to cut this one short. I hope you figure out your complex problem without giving yourself an aneurysm. Take care. I love you. 




 Well, you implied the guy was retarded, like he didn't understand that dipping a wet spoon into a bag of kratom was bad. All I was doing was pointing out that he probably didn't fucking mean to do it that way. If you weren't such an asshole about his advice, I wouldn't have said what I did. See how that works, pumpkin? 




 Kratom. It'll give you a tingly feeling in your ballsack.....
...Kratom. Toilet paper now lasts 3 weeks.....Kratom. You won't want to beat your girlfriend as much.....Kratom. Shitting like a rabbit is great...... Kratom. Gagging never felt so good. Unless you're gay. ......Kratom. Boners were never really that important anyway. ....Kratom. Crying when the mail's late is normal, right? .....Kratom. So good even your eyeballs will be staggering. .....Kratom. No more wet shits, rim jobs are now game all day long. ......Kratom. No, you dumb slamhog, I don't want to go get something to eat yet. We need to get the fuck home so I can dose before I smack the living fuck out of you. (See number 3) 




 Amps just give me motivation to jack off for like 9 hours.  




 I use their measuring spoon, I just dump it out into a regular spoon each time and then put it in my mouth. It sort of surprises me that you wouldn't be able to figure out a way around dumping the wet measuring spoon back into the bag. 




 Fuck those dirty fuckin cocksuckers. It's shit like that that gives kratom a bad fucking name. Foxykotton. Anybody who buys that shit is directly contributing to kratom's downfall. 




 I would be out in about 3 hours, Kramer style 




 Yes... go there and search "speciosa" in the search bar. You have to do it that way every time if you want to see their kratom. Sorry, I should have mentioned that. 




 I hate to beat a dead horse shill style, but I take RVS every day, and I get it from Herbal Salvation. It's 25 bucks plus 5 for shipping for 105 grams, and it's great. Those numbers you're reading aren't really much to rely on... just get it, start at 2 grams, and go from there. 




 That's exactly the type of program Mac is referring to. It's ridiculous. The one I had to go to recently was $95 for an hour and a half session. There's like 12 people and one counselor. That's almost 1200 dollars they make just for us to sit in a circle and shoot the shit. It's a fuckin joke. I've done plenty of those outpatient programs, and I must say, if you really want help, go to AA or NA. It's free and it's sure as hell a lot more helpful than outpatient programs... unless, of course, you're mandated to go to outpatient, like I was... then we don't have a choice. 




 They're bullshitting you. It's a tactic they use to try to get you to admit you've done something. If your piss test comes back clean, there's no way for them to tell you've ever taken any opioids at any point in your life, period. 




 If it bothers you so much, you could just stop coming here. IDK if you thought about that. I think you might have some sort of mental retardation. 




 If you're getting high on oxy every day, your tolerance will build up to 100 mg in no time. That's a pretty average dose for a regular user. 




 Isn't it supposed to have a money back guarantee? 




 Wtf are you talkin about man. #1: He needs to drop two on an empty stomach and go from there. If he drops three with food in his stomach,  he'll likely not even fuckin feel it. #2: He also needs to wait longer than fuckin 20 minutes before dosing more, you crazy asshole. More like an hour. You might start to feel the effects after 10-20 minutes but they're nowhere near done hitting you at that point. I don't feel the full effects until about 40-50 minutes after dropping it on an empty stomach. #3: It's blatantly fucking obvious that both of those are plain leaf. Anybody who's done even rudimentary research on kratom knows exactly what those fuckin strains are, and they sure as hell know the vendor they came from, seeings how it's the most fucking popular one on reddit... if not the most popular period.  #4: WHO THE FUCK PAYS A DOLLAR FOR A GRAM OF PLAIN LEAF?!?!?!?! Take your shitty ass advice over to r/KratomKorner and keep it over there, dickface. 




 Poppy seed Tizzea. 




 Phew. Thanks for lettin me know man. Appreciate it. 




 Oh shit. I don't have enough posts to message anybody or comment on XDA so I didn't say anything over there, but I didn't realize you were the guy lol. Thanks man. Greatly appreciated. I sent Huawei an email 2 days ago for the unlock code. Haven't heard back yet. 




 Just get the Paypal debit card and use that on sites that accept Mastercard. 




 I wish it was a little more in-depth. 




 Well. Percocet, like anything with "ocet" in the name, has acetominophen in it... I know what you're talking about though. Roxies. Instant release oxycodone. Yeah 30 mg a day isn't much of a hook. NAMSAYIN. 




 This brother righteous. 




 I was just about to say that lol. 




 It makes an unbelievable difference... 30 mg of fentanyl would kill somebody, whereas 30 mg of codeine probably wouldn't even be felt. 




 Kratom used to cause me terrible sinus issues. They've pretty much gone away since I quit snorting it though. 




 30 mg of what opiate? Would need to know. 




 You just gotta get good at spreading the ballskin taut, and then itching it. I love it. Feels like Jesus is touching my nutsack. 




 Ginger root 




 Roger that. Can't blame you there... but if you run into any nausea issues, cop yourself some ginger candy or ginger ale. I chase every ingestion with a couple swigs of ginger ale. 




 Yeah my drugs of choice in order were opiates, meth, benzos and addies. That shit's all behind me now though, thanks to the big K. And yeah man it's only 6 bucks for 4 10 gram samples. No Maha Kali though. I tried asking for it, not realizing they don't give that one out in samples, and I ended up receiving a white vein lol. I was pissed. I just can't bring myself to pay 35 bucks for 100 grams. It won't be long before I cop a kilo of the Red Vein Sumatran from Bikhuk, seeings how it's half the price of HS. Unfortunately they don't have Bali, I'd probably just keep getting that from HS. 




 BLUCKA BLUCKA SUP NUGGAH That would make sense, because the Bali I received gave me more side effects than anything. I'm sure I could have talked to Ken about it but it wasn't even worth the aggravation to me. I use Bali every day, I would have to get it from somewhere else regardless. I did receive a sample of White Vein Indo from them, and that was the first and last white vein I ever tried. Nothing against them, I'm just not into the whites. Gives me wicked anxiety. Funny that I shot meth for 7 years but if I try to smoke weed or consume white vein kratom, I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack. lol. 




 I ordered from MS twice, got Bali both times and I honestly didn't even think it was good, don't even understand what people are raving about. I went to HS and got way better Bali for a hell of a lot cheaper than MS, and I haven't looked back since. 




 If you just ate, don't even bother trying to take any more for a couple hours... it works best if you're hungry when you take it, I usually wait til I feel the first hunger pang come on. Having any food in your stomach greatly diminishes the effects... But you probably just didn't take enough. Take 3 g of that RVT and mix it with 2 g of that Green Malaysian. I love RVT but I gotta mix it with Green Bali to get the most out of it. Redosing is cool if you don't feel like you got enough of an effect, but not if you just ate. 




 I think I would like to own it. 




 Heyyy-ooooooo iOSPoundcake. You made a fine choice. RVT is the stuff dreams are made of. Is that an Apple computer I see? You dirty traitor.  




 I just looked at your post history under your username... you did morphine three days ago. How dare you come here and chastise us. Just because you're a morphine addict doesn't mean you have to drag people who are maintaining a positive lifestyle down with you. Shut the fuck up. 




 I, too, would like to know how much he took. 




 Shoot it into your dick vein. 




 ROGER THAT ROGER THAT TEN FOUR MOTHER FUCKER I CAN DIG IT LOUD AND CLEAR I GOT THAT GINGER CANDY ON STAND-BY READY TO ROLL IF THAT SHIT GETS REAL YA HEARD SICK TWISTED GINGER GAME SO HARD CARTMAN BE HATIN NAMSAYIN

 AH-CHA-CHA
 




 GOOD THING I GOT THAT RED THAI COMIN IN HOT FROM IDAHO TODAY YEAH NIGGGUHHHHHH STRAIN SWITCH 




 No, I hate whites and Maeng Da so I'm not sayin just mix anything with reds... I'm just saying from my own personal experience that mixing Green Bali with reds gets me exactly what I'm looking for.  




 Oh and mix Green Vein Bali with the Red Vein Borneo, or Red Sumatran or Red Thai or whatever. That's the ticket, boy. 




 It will definitely help with premature ejaculation, but it will have a detrimental effect on your sex drive. It's all about timing. Sex might not seem appealing an hour after ingestion, but you'll last as long as you want to in bed. Or in the kitchen... Basically wherever your slampig likes doing it. But there is a sweet spot, somewhere between 3-5 hours after ingestion... at least for me. A little trial and error is in order... but oh Jesus lord, prepare to pay for it dearly if you decide to quit taking kratom. You think you blow your nut quick now? It'll be ten times worse after you quit, until enough time passes by and you go back to normal... which, your normal is premature anyway. It's quite a predicament.  




 me fuckin too. great phone but desperately needs root.
 




 The doc uses kratom?
 




 Sometimes all it takes to cure kratom-dick is a little of the test_subject7558's eloquence.  




 Are you ready to stop touching children? 




 I wouldn't give kratom to my cat. He has to be ready for peanut butter time at a moment's notice. 




 That's extremely common. Generally speaking, if you execute sexy-time with your old lady, you'll still end up with a boner and the desire to make her fat rolls quiver. You just have to go for it. 




 He wakes up, hits the bathroom for a quick jack-off (his wife is a cunt), and then he uses a trowel to scoop heaps of phenibut into his mouth. Then he mumbles and stumbles for a bit, bumps his head on some things, gets some coffee and walks to work. Then he's set for the day. He says his hands have never been as steady as phenibut makes them. I suppose that's a good thing, considering he's a dentist. 




 What a coincidence. I introduced my dentist to phenibut and now he can't start his day without a phenibut OD-blackout. He says it really hits the spot, gets his juices flowing. 




 Dude, an activation rig consists of a magnetron daisy-chained inline with a 2 farad capacitor (500 volt of course) and a low-fidelity digitizer. Do you even kratom, bro? I feel so bad for people who ingest dormant kratom... my life hasn't been the same since I built my activation rig. 




 Just dump it out into a pile on a GLASS plate, and get a TV remote. Make sure the batteries in the remote are good. Point the remote at the pile while holding down one button for 20 minutes... any button, doesn't matter. After 20 minutes, all static will have dissipated no matter how large the pile. Make sure you don't let go of the button at any time while you're pointing the remote at it or you'll have to start all over again. 




 Huh? Are you being sarcastic or is there something I don't know? Facebook? 




 You are thoroughly entertaining me, and I appreciate it.
 




 WHAT 




 No problem. Glad to help.
