 you get a pack of 5 cards no matter what your record is in arena, unless I am misunderstanding you 




 Since you get 5 cards minimum per arena, obviously a terrible idea 




 Hmm, that is something I didn't know, and you are right, certainly has a very large impact on results.

I'd like to see Blizzard eventually implement a mode with 2 out of 3s, and a 5-8 card sideboard only for games 2 and 3. 




 23 total decks from 6 tourneys (11/2, 11/3,  11/9, 11/10, 11/16, 11/17). One tourney only reported top 3 decks, the rest had top 4. One tourney had 2 decklists for one place(switched mid tourney or sideboarded into, not sure), so I counted them as worth half each.

* Rogue - 37% (8.5 decks)
* Warlock - 22% (5 decks)
* Paladin - 13% (3 decks)
* Druid - 13% (3 decks)
* Mage - 11% (2.5 decks)
* Priest - 4% (1 deck)
* Hunter, Shaman, Warrior - 0%

Yes, the meta is undergoing a lot of changes and it's a relatively small sample size, but the player quality is likely high and the tournaments are large. I thought it provided an interesting view into the current metagame. 




 rogues, warlocks, paladins, OTK hunters, shamans, mages. I guess "paper" is pretty broad 




 no, it's just conjecture, plain and simple 




 entering for my bro, thanks 




 deal dmg, usually means deal one damage, usually from an ability 




 super wrong 




 They could try and make something like [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=217992) from MtG, but they'd need to test it pretty heavily as this mechanic would be very, very good in Hearthstone. 




 This game is not Magic the Gathering. Rather than countering cards you need to predict what they'll play and lure out their good cards like flamestrike and mind control so they don't get great value out of them. 




 Rogue actually. Love playing priests, they are essentially free wins. 




 obviously not if everyone is still complaining 




 Always good to see lower ranked play determining what's balanced or not...   :\ 




 You mean you actually have to strategically lure out their removal rather than just slamming legendaries? How boring... 




 And it's true because Jimbo727 says so 




 Priests do not need a nerf, they are not good in the first place. 




 Priests are this game's control deck, OTK Hunters are this game's combo deck. Looking at tournament results and hearing opinions from top players, neither of these heroes are very good at the moment in comparison to some of the top classes.

Crying to nerf or change a class that isn't very good in the first place is crazy. Hearthstone needs variety in playstyles. Cutting the control and combo elements from a game is a horrible idea, and just devolves the game into an all aggro deck fest where who can curve out the best wins.

Maybe control or combo isn't fun for you, but playing aggro vs. aggro every match doesn't sound very fun to me. 




 I mean, maybe you still use mind control, I'm not sure. It's just so slow and against a lot of decks the best thing you can steal is like a 4/5, and then you just get smashed and die. The 5+ SW I think is at best a one-of, and probably fine not playing it at all.

I used to play priest and switched to rogue, it just seems like as the meta gets more aggro there are fewer and fewer good matchups for priest. 




 Or you could just buy a game that actually values your time in the first place 




 priests are generally junk now, they are like free wins for a good amount of the very popular deck builds out there. Mind control is pretty bad as a lot of games are decided by turn 8, SW:P is junk maindeck, etc...switch up to something that counters aggro builds like circle of healing/auchenai, or just play a new hero 




 not bad on an acolyte of pain or loot hoarder either 




 entering for my bro, thanks 




 psh that's how I play 90% of the time and I still rattle off 7+ on the reg son 




 Spelunky is great, lots of replay value with daily challenge runs. My personal favorite buy of the year. Rogue Legacy is also good but there's no multiplayer and I have invested a lot less time in it than Spelunky, which I'm still playing for short periods daily. Haven't tried Risk of Rain yet 




 Just temper your expectations, he was good last week but he's been pretty dogshit since taking over for Daniels. The Jax matchup this week is a plus though 




 Says the guy whining about how he sucks at arena 




 That's why top players have around 80% arena winrates, right? They must be soooo lucky. Only scrubs complain about rng/luck 




 Because it isn't luck 




 he's not fixed 




 What makes it the best? I haven't heard of it, playing Hearthstone mainly right now. I have Solforge as well but there's nothing to do in that game 




 I don't think there's a way to drop cards into your lap in hearthstone though 




 posting for my brother who would greatly appreciate one 




 Priests have never been OP in my opinion, they're just the most swingy class and people get pissed when you mind control them to flip the advantage in a game.

They're a class I've even taken to avoiding in arena due to me getting much better results with others, the class heavily relying on picking up mind controls and a few other choice cards, and being very weak to 4 power swarm decks that can survive a turn 5 holy nova. 




 Ah, gaming culture. The only time reviews are taken as truth, and aren't done by "paid shills" or are just "clickbait", is when it's a franchise the majority wants to see do well 




 I'm on the fence. I've heard great things about Expeditions, but I wish it wasn't a flat 6 bucks, especially when nothing else is really of interest to me. I think this is the cheapest E:C has been though, and I doubt it gets any lower than 5 bucks during winter sale (75% off). 




  For whatever reason the #3 receiver in Miami is the #1 receiver.

It's because they're the slot receivers, and Miami's embarrassing O line basically forces Tannehill to throw it to the short yardage guy nearly every play

 




 Nobody is saying a tier list lets you rattle off 9-0s, but it will probably at least help out this 0-3 guy, at the very least to let him know that certain cards he's been drafting are downright unplayable 




 another mind control whine thread... 




 SylasSlays, arbiter of fun has made his decree 




 Fable 3 is so boring and the worst of the Fables by far. It's an ARPG that is incredibly easy, lacks variety in combat, doesn't really have much in the way of interesting mechanics. The "twist" in the game is so poorly done and feels either not thought out at all or completely unfinished.

I actually liked 1 and 2 to boot. Definitely skip it. 




 shelter is 1$ here along with other bundled games - www.groupees.com/bmx 




 None of them 




 Yes, I'd take the flier on Johnson 




 Ivory 




 does he really though? I'd say it's arguable, he's probably still behind deangleo and tolbert 




 I definitely wouldn't count on Johnson being a savior, he's pretty much a lottery ticket. Then again, the over/under for points on JStew is probably around 4, so maybe you grab Johnson and hope he breaks loose. I don't think Stewart really helps you this week or ROS 




 according to rotoworld, he is 




 No, Tate is getting the start, and ARI has a tough run D. If it were ROS I'd say yes 




 there will not 




 How can you possibly claim that when you have no idea what the mechanics of the game will be 




 @DavisMattek - Dennis Johnson is the best add in fantasy right now. Foster very, very out, Tate with broken ribs. Make the move.

I wouldn't go crazy dropping guys, but if you have filler on your bench, could be a nice help on your way to/during playoffs 




  No last hitting

I'm sure hardcore MOBA players will hate this and claim to ruin any depth the game will have, but personally I like this change a lot. 

 




 can't wait to feast on noobs in arena 




 Why would you even be concerned about this in an alpha build 




 I wouldn't call Hearthstone "blatantly pay-to-win", especially since arena mode isn't pay to win in the slightest. As for constructed, it's a CCG, what do you expect 




 Is the Gold Edition DLC worthwhile for someone with only the base game? I've heard mixed things about the Head Games DLC, and have been waiting on a purchase since I don't want to ruin the original. As far as I know, there is no way to play just the base game once the DLC is installed. 




 Why do you even need to say it in the first place? 




 Because it's pretty much just rubbing in the loss. Due to only having emoticons, it's hard to tell if your opponent is actually using it as "good match, you played well", or "haha, I win". I don't need to hear well played before my opponent plays his ripped pyroblast or king krush. Just play the damn card and take the win gracefully. 




 Arena is fine, the RNG is what makes it fun. I played a mage deck with 5 blizzards the other day. Other times I pick mage I won't even get a sniff of any board sweep.

Half the fun of playing arena is making shitty pulls work. 




 Saying well played before you actually go through the motions to kill them is definitely rude, yes. 




 They do, it's called magic online. It's still just as expensive though 




 Definitely really strong in arena, but doesn't need a nerf.

He does have a few downsides. Playing arena as a paladin last night, I think I got 2 free wins by hitting him with an Aldor Peacekeeper(humility also works) and leaving him alone. My opponents desperately tried to suicide him, but by the time he died it was far too late... 




 I mean, afterall, f2p is a misnomer because if you really want to enjoy your f2p game it typically is no longer f2p.

I'm enjoying it just fine without having spent anything 




 You can only de cards from expert packs 




 turn 1 sinister strike 




 It sounds like he hasn't even played it 




 Sure, I get that. I'm just not sure why this thread is about how Solforge is so much better than Hearthstone, because simply put, it really isn't right now. 




 I play both, but quite honestly (and probably unpopularly) Hearthstone is much better right now. It seems like this thread is kind of a knee jerk reaction to hating the big mainstream company, or hating a competitor of a game that we love and are invested in.

To clarify - I think they are both interesting, well made base gameplay CCGs, and I don't think that either is more fun or deep than the other. Solforge is really lacking behind Hearthstone in a lot of ways, though -

* Draft. Right now Solforge has nothing, Hearthstone has arena mode fully implemented which is very enjoyable.

* Free rewards. Both games have daily quests/rewards that are easy to complete. Hearthstone however lets you disenchant cards you don't want and allows you to essentially trade in cards for any card in the game. Solforge, you're cracking crappy free packs and crossing your fingers for a rare - maybe hoarding silver, which we have no idea what it can even be used for.

* Pay to win factor. There is a little bit in both games, but this comes back to the fact that in hearthstone you can craft anything, and only have one legendary per deck. A deck that won a recent tourney, I was able to put together in 2 days not buying anything. In Solforge, 3x legendaries seem to be practically required if you want to play something tier 1 - zimus, phoenix, ghox etc.

* Polish. Blizzard clearly has the upper hand here, Hearthstone is extremely polished, looks and feels great. Solforge has server lag, timer issues, crashes when you open packs, etc...

Maybe all of this stuff gets ironed out when Solforge finally releases some updates, but as it stands I'm playing Hearthstone most of the night, then I'll login to play my 3 quick matches in solforge and quit because there's nothing to do in the game right now. 




 The worst are the people who slowroll the timer every turn, period 




 well played 




 I'm fine with leaving that skillless mechanic with mtg. 




 Not really. Priests are pretty weak to strong 4 attack cards. Playing more of those and cutting some of your top end doesn't gimp you against the rest of the field. 

You aren't running an "anti priest deck", you are just metagaming. Look at chanmanv's unleash the hounds deck - it doesnt care about mind control at all, and hey, it's still pretty strong against the rest of the field!

If you want to keep dropping ysera turn 9 and then go to reddit complaining that priests are so op, go ahead, but you aren't working very hard to actually beat them 




 Or, rather than complaining, you could just design your deck to not be weak against mind control? Just a thought. 




 subtle brag 




 onions make me sad - a lot of people don't realize that. 




 It's pretty similar.

Major Differences -

* in mtg you put land in decks, which you can play one a turn. these are essentially mana crystals. In mtg you need to think about how many land you want to put into your deck, as not drawing enough/too many will screw you - in hearthstone you just get the ideal 1 mana crystal per turn.

* In mtg you only declare you are attacking with a creature - the other player can choose to put one of their guys in front, or take the damage himself.

* In mtg you have opportunites to play spells during your opponent's turn.

These are the major differences, obviously there are plenty of other small differences but the basic gameplay is pretty similar otherwise 




 You can store up to 3, you get one per day 




 No, and to my knowledge it never will due to flash limitations. BOI:Rebirth will have controller support.

As an aside, I'm one of the few that plays BOI with controller and j2k and I don't have any problems. I like it a lot more than KB 




 Can somebody give me a quick sales pitch for someone that doesn't know all that much about this game? 




 I don't think that's true for Halloween sale 




 MTG bans cards, invalidating entire deck archetypes and making other cards worthless in the process. Welcome to CCGs! 




 You can't report them, but they clearly need to implement a time bank or something. It's immature children grasping for a way to troll someone in a game where nearly every method has been prevented.

It is incredibly annoying to play against, especially when you only have so much time to play, and end up using 45 minutes of your time because your opponent has no life and nothing better to do. 




 Waiting until the timer runs down to one second every turn isn't strategic, it's just being a dick 




 It's a beta 




 can you start an arena, exit the game before you get your 3 losses, and continue the next day? 














 Looking for a time killer team to add to my other two, nothing serious. It appears Yahoo doesn't have signups for midseason/redraft. Am I just missing it? Any other major sites still have midseason leagues available to join?

Leaning towards accepting this counter, but wanted to give it a run through you guys first as it's a big one

Edit: Ended up accepting, yahoo eval trade had me as losing so wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything. Thanks guys

Leaning towards doing the trade as I think PIT isn't going to put up a lot of points, I'm worried about my RB depth, and Givens has nice upside for a throw in. If Wilson goose eggs me, I lose my top WR but I can hope Gordon/Blackmon/Harvin fill the void when they each respectively get back. Thanks for your help in advance 




 14 team Standard non PPR. I need to bench one guy, got ravaged last week with Miller and Wilson giving me duds.

2 RB/2 WR/1 FLEX, CJ2K is locked in by default as my RB1, giving me 4 spots for 5 guys.

Which do I bench out of:

WR: Edelman, Austin, Shorts
RB: Wilson, Miller

Thanks 




 I just drafted a 14 team league non-PPR, (1 QB 2 RB 2 WR 1 TE 1 FLEX 1 PK 1 TD), and am projected for a close week 1 matchup - within a point of yahoo projections. My defense is GB, playing SF. I'm not sure if GB has any value making it worth it to hold onto them, or if I should drop them and pick up a highly projected defense this week and each week after.

I'm looking at a few available - 

* WAS vs PHI
* KC vs JAX 
* IND vs OAK
* CLE vs MIA

I also could drop a bench player for a fill-in defense this week - likely Tannehill, but there are very few backup QBs available - Even EJ and Pryor are gone, leaving Geno, Ponder, and Henne/Gabbert as the only active QBs currently available if Tannehill gets scooped up.

My team for reference -

* QB -Andrew Luck, Ryan Tannehill
* RB -Trent Richardson, Steven Jackson, Reggie Bush, Ronnie Hillman
* TE - Jermichael Finley, Dwayne Allen
* WR - Antonio Brown, Miles Austin, Kenny Britt, Josh Gordon, Justin Blackmon
* PK - Randy Bullock
* TD - Green Bay Packers


What do you guys think? 




 I'm new to the game(FE:LH), picked it up during summer sale. I feel I get most of the mechanics but this is bugging me. Just looking to hear if there is a concensus, as once I start to get many hero units, it becomes slightly overwhelming.

- I generally keep a hero unit in each of my cities to defend it. My cities are protected, but my unit never levels up unless the city is heavily attacked, which is very rare. Is this smart, or should I just use basic forces like militias to defend?

- Is it wise to put multiple hero units in one army? Does this cause exp degradation? I generally don't do this, but will often combine heroes if I want to make an assault on a city early (for example in the first scenario, I used my sovereign, jormur the giant, and the giant golem you get from the quest...didn't even initially realize they were hero units)

- Should your heroes all just be wandering and exploring the map? Any other advice?

Thanks in advance.

 I just received a new 3DS with Fire Emblem Awakening for father's day. What games are must haves for the system? A few things to keep in mind, I know noone else with a 3DS so multiplayer centric games like Animal Crossing don't interest me that much. I generally have a broad taste in games, but particularly like:

RPGs, roguelikes, strategy games, metroidvanias, and indie games. I have a huge game backlog, so I don't really need recommendations of mediocre games (Castlevania for example - not sure if it is mediocre or not but the reviews didn't look very favorable.)

Thanks!

 The game looks cool, seems like Robotron 2084 with upgrades and a makeover. Does this play pretty tight for a twinstick shooter? Alternatively, are other games from this dev (Puppy Games) worth looking into? 




 I know literally nothing of the series, or the quality of the ports to PC. Older graphics won't turn me off, but is the gameplay dated? Any insight to the series is appreciated. They're currently on sale 2.50 each, 6.25 for the bundle on steam. 




 My friends and I saw this late one night on VH1, and now I can't find it. It definitely had a music video, but so far searches have gotten me nothing. Thanks 




 Sega game, most likely genesis or sega cd, early 90s - A ship crosses the ocean, the oars move fast to an upbeat tune. The ship is black I believe. The battle system is on a green field and the enemy is on the other side, it's more than one bad guy. And there are red X's and O's. Black dragons were also involved somehow.

Edit: we figured it out, King's Bounty for Genesis
 









 This game is a updated version of a free flash game on adultswim.com, just recently released on steam. The basic idea of the game is that you are a badass ninja who starts on floor 350 of a tower and descends to the bottom, fighting enemies and bosses at set levels as you go down. The game is procedurally generated and has permadeath of sorts (5 health that is upgradable, 2 continues), so the replayability of the game is very high.

The game is challenging without feeling impossible. It is similar to Dark Souls in the way of once you learn aspects of the game, you begin to breeze through parts that were once stopping blocks. The game to me plays like an amalgamation of NES Ninja Gaiden, Mega Man X, Super Meat Boy, and Hotline Miami, with lots of bits of other games sprinkled in.

Each kill increases a rage meter, which gives you temporary invincibility when it's filled, but is always going down. This increases your score as well, so you are encouraged to go quickly. If you've played Hotline Miami and know the feeling when you get into the zen state where everything works out, that is this game at its best when you are destroying enemies left and right, jumping over spike pits, and clearing 100+ floors without taking a hit.

Along with being procedurally generated, there are tons of unlocks to strive to get, and they greatly vary the play experience and increase replayability. There are 10+ different unlockable choices for each weapon of your starting loadout - weapon, ranged weapon, bomb, and magic(4 choices for magic). Getting tired of katana/shurikens? Play through with a whip/axe instead for a Castlevania throwback. You also can unlock various things like increased item limits, item pickups, and cosmetic changes. Probably 100 unlocks in all.

The sound in the game is great, and the visuals are crisp and look great even when you're racing through the levels. This is a game I picked up on a whim and I've found to be an absolute gem. At less than 5 bucks right now, it is definitely a steal, highly recommended. 









 It is currently on sale for 2.50 on steam, but I'm more concerned if it's worth my time than the money, as my time to game is becoming scarce.

I don't know much about the game, but enjoy the rpg/srpg genre. I am cool with old school as well, have played and enjoyed baldurs gate, planescape, avernum, etc, though I play many games from a wide variety of genres. Thanks! 
























 Currently on sale at 50% as a steam flash deal. Curious if I should buy the entire bundle, certain games, or none at all. I'm worried that this is a series that hasn't aged well, but know very little of any of the games. 




 I just picked this game up, and have read a few guides, but there are still a few things I don't understand. I started a new game in Dublin.

One of the first things I did was to create the title of duke of meath once i had the gold. However, I noticed doing so changed my succesion laws from primogeniture to gavelkind, which was annoying as my initial ruler died to illness almost immediately, so I could not change it. Why did the succession laws change?

Secondly, after getting a CB on Kildare, i gathered my armies and attacked. Still not exactly sure how war works. I defeated their main army, and sieged their town. Do I want to press the button that says (paraphrasing) press the attack but risk more casualties? Or do I just sit there and build war score until i get a surrender?

Finally, once i get the surrender, I noticed the guy is still in charge of kildare but it's in my holdings. Should i tax him? Revoke his title? Imprison him? It seemed somewhat counterintuitive to me that the territory i just captured won't be making me any gold. 

Thank you all for taking the time to help me out. 




 Looking for something fun to pass the time - I'm a big gamer, and my wife is no stranger to gaming either, but not as hardcore.

 Hey guys, been out of the game for a while, since around new phyrexia, but I'm a pretty experienced drafter and grinded the PTQ scene a few years. Going to an fnm draft tonight, Any tips on drafting this set? Colors to push/avoid, speed of the set, availability of removal, underrated/overrated cards, and specific synergies would be helpful.

 I have been out of the standard scene for a while - i quit right before caw blade bannings. I'm looking to put together a standard deck, but I'm pretty unsure what to initially build. I have mostly everything I'd need from before new phyrexia, and could likely trade for the rest.

I'm leaning towards UW delver or a controllish build (UB?), but I figure a lot of you could tell me which decks are tier 1-2, which are on the rise/fall, etc. Thanks! 







































 they never add anything to weekly sales 




 If you like military games 




 I didn't think it was his best work either, but still overall a great read. The thing about Slaughterhouse Five (and most of what I've read of Vonnegut) is some of the passages in the book just stand out, and are unforgettable. Someone posted here the other day the excerpt about the poor in America, so I'll throw this one out there instead -

The visitor from outer space made a serious study of Christianity, to learn, if he could, why Christians found it so easy to be cruel. He concluded that at least part of the trouble was slipshod storytelling in the New Testament. He supposed that the intent of the Gospels was to teach people, among other things, to be merciful, even to the lowest of the low.

But the Gospels actually taught this:

Before you kill somebody, make absolutely sure he isnt well connected. So it goes.

The flaw in the Christ stories, said the visitor from outer space, was that Christ, who didnt look like much, was actually the Son of the Most Powerful Being in the Universe. Readers understood that, so, when they came to the crucifixion, they naturally thought, and Rosewater read out loud again:

Oh, boythey sure picked the wrong guy to lynch _that_ time!

And that thought had a brother: There are right people to lynch. Who? People not well connected. So it goes." 




 Sorry for the tired often repeated post, just looking for opinions. I have about every rare and most epics. I've been maining curi's board control warlock, but am trying to build towards druid or maybe shaman.

I have: Sylvanas, Rag, Tinkmaster, Velen, King Krush.

Should I craft Cenarius? Black Knight? Cairne? Something Else? 




 I'm not really into CS, but in League when someone on your team sucks, they end up feeding the other team which inherently makes that member of the other team a lot more powerful. If they're bad enough, they will make someone on the other team so powerful that they have essentially singlehandedly lost the game for your team, all the while you have to suffer and play against someone who is a lot more powerful than you are until the game is over. You likely end up dying a lot due to something out of your control.

Not an excuse to be an asshole, but a possible explanation of why League/DOTA can be really frustrating. 




 Overcosted is the wrong word, should have used too expensive. It's too expensive to be played right now, as it's a dead card in aggro matchups. Maybe that changes after the next patch, when it seems like aggro will drop off a little and druid and shaman control will rise up (or maybe hunter becomes playable) 




 The effect is still pretty insane, but it's now really overcosted since the nerf 




 Hunter otk is gone, warrior charge otk is gone, pyroblast and mages were nerfed. It's pretty clear Blizzard isn't fostering one turn kill mechanics and that they don't want them in the game. 




  but in heartstone you can win with some classes in one turn even if the other guy have 20 health and board control and there is nothing you can do about it

Not true anymore

 




 You are getting downvotes because you are whining and stating things that aren't actually correct. I did not downvote you, but I'll try to address your points fairly.

* **It's mostly luck-based.** Yes, this game is not chess, it is a card game. All card games are based on a mixture of skill and luck. Just becuase there are RNG minions, does not mean the game is total luck though. Have you ever played poker? It's a game based on calculating odds based on known and unknown factors. I'll take your mad bomber example - Let's say I have a 3/1 divine Shield, and you have 3 minions, one of which is a blood imp. Is it worth mad bombering here? How important is getting rid of your blood imp to me? Can I afford to have the bomber hit my own life total or get rid of my shield? Should I save the bomber for a more opportune moment or do I need the 3/2 body to keep tempo? Should I attack first, increasing the odds of hitting your blood imp but potentially allowing my 3/1 to be killed? Am I playing into board sweep or setting up a potentially bad trade based on what I'm anticipating you to have? Do you have Hellfire in hand?

  Sometimes your mad bomber just kills your 3/3, and yeah, that is super unlikely and really sucks, but to claim there is no strategy because of it? That is not true.

  Cards like Blood Knight are perfectly fine. It is a sick answer to a metagame dominated by argent squires to catch people unaware. A mediocre card that is really good against certain deck types - literally every competitive CCG has cards like this.

* **It's Pay-To-Win.** Hearthstone has just about the least offensive model of any CCG. Solforge? Far worse. Magic? Hahaha. The top constructed decks have around 1-5 legendary cards in them, with Druid Control generally being the most expensive. I practically have this entire deck after one or two months without spending a dime - I'm missing two of the five legendaries. Also, the legendaries AREN'T EVEN THAT GOOD OR GAMESHAPING! Most are niche cards, with exceptions being Sylvanas and maybe Rag. You do not need legendaries to be competitive. Crafting them is also very easy and not nearly as hard as you make it to be. I've crafted two legendaries in a month or two without even disenchanting anything besides duplicates. Not to mention you can craft any card you want - unlike other games where you need to just keep cracking packs.

* **One of the two game modes sits behind a paywall.** No, this is pretty much a huge exaggeration. Yes, arena costs 150 gold or $1.99. Daily quests give you anywhere from 40 to 100 gold, and you get 10 gold per 3 constructed wins. Not only that, but winning in arena GIVES YOU MORE GOLD. Going 7-3 gives you over 150 gold! Arena is far from random and very skill based. Many, many players are able to average 7-12 wins per run. Also, stating that Blizzard has reduced the rewards is just a straight up lie - they actually INCREASED them nearly across the board when they made the move to 12 being the maximum win number. I have never paid for arena and do one or more nearly every day.

So yeah, that is probably why you are getting the downvotes 




 Seriously? Solforge is pretty fun but it is super pay to win. The free to play rewards I get are most often a small amount of silver and a common I have numerous copies of. The Drafts are great, but as a f2p player expect to be able to play one every week if you're lucky.

Constructed is really dependent on legendaries (hope you got lucky and have 3 Thundersaurs!) and incredibly unbalanced - at least when N/T Shapers was completely dominant you only needed a few legendaries - Zimus, Phoenix, etc. Now that A/U Weirwood Thundersaur is the best deck by a country mile, hope you have thundersaurs, blightsteel gargoyles, 2/4 free robot guy, etc 




 It's almost like games became more complex or something 




 Sure you can, you can stop writing off people complaining about being threatened as being "pretty damn irritating" 




 Yeah, being empathetic towards other people's problem totally sucks 




 That's not true at all. It's simple, but it has a lot of decisions. Obviously it relies on random factor, but so does every card game. Arena in itself has 30 decisions just when making the deck. Then there are decisions to be made with the mulligan process, with which creature to attack, when to attack your opponent's creatures rather than go to the face, trying to predict what your opponent's possible responses to your plays are, etc. What you are saying is simply wrong 




 ok 




 Well, you've spent 60 bucks, by all means extrapolate on how you'd like to rape this guy's mother 




 The point is they actually get paid well enough to deal with that sort of bullshit 




  The fact is 90% of games are shipped broken, buggy, or half-finished. It doesn't help you go to shit like CES with amazing pre-rendered scenes, but the game never looks anything like it.

Said by someone who clearly has no idea how programming works

 




 How is it not clear that this only applies to the chuckleheads actually doing this sort of thing 




  Have you seen the hatred lobbed at Michael Bay and Justin Bieber? How about George Lucas from 1999 on? Its nothing new and certainly isn't unique to gaming.

* George Lucas net worth - 7.3 billion dollars.

* Michael Bay net worth - 400 million dollars.

* Justin Bieber net worth - 130 million dollars.


Totally fair to compare them to the Call of Duty balance patch guy who makes a 6 figure salary if he's lucky

 




 Fuck all of this "tl:dr - it's the internet, learn to deal with trolls, blah blah blah" nonsense. Not sure why it's so hard to just say that yeah this guy is right, we shouldn't be dicks 




  And I'm sick of indie developers and publishers thinking they're entitled to my money simply because they "made a game".

And you got "indie and entitled" from a guy saying he just finished working on a AAA game how? Oh right, because you didn't read the article

 




 There is a tutorial, it does a good job teaching you the basics of the game. 




 Easy. It is less complicated and more streamlined than most other card games, but still has a good amount of complexity to the game. 




 I'm sure bloggers will strictly follow those rules! Betting this game sucks 




 Nice metagame, lol 




 "Franchises we would like to see on the WiiU" 




 Looks like a guy drumming up page views with some fake F-Zero fan art to me 




 Sylvanas 




 Yeah. I might keep truesilver because it's just so good, but most of the time, I think just being able to play out a 2-3-4 or 2-2-3-4 with the coin start usually just trumps keeping a good card. Getting behind in this game is pretty brutal and I believe coming out strong is pretty important for arena.

Plus, this game 9 times out of 10 just gives you back the cards you mull anyways, so you might just get that sick 4 drop back ;) 




 Stormwind champ vs faerie dragon is close and you could probably make an argument that the champ is the better pick, especially in this deck. 




 One of those cases where it depends. Is it a 3 card or 4 card hand? What does the curve of your deck look like? How many 2 drops are you running? How awful would it be to drop your hero power turn 2? (Pally being not ideal, warrior completely awful?) Hearthstone is more complex than most make it out to be.

Yeti is obviously a top 4 drop, and if you manage to draw into something to play on turn 2/3, slamming a yeti turn 4 is obviously awesome. All I can really say is know your deck. Sometimes I'll have a deck with nuts lategame (3 flamestrikes or something like that) and not enough lower drops. In that case, I'd throw the yeti back, as I know I'd be drawing lategame power. Other times your curve just looks like a diagonal line from 2 drops down, so there I'd probably keep the yeti in hopes of out-tempoing my opponent and winning quickly.

In most general cases, I'd likely throw it back on a 3 card hand, and keep it (assuming it's the sole keeper) in a 4 card hand. I know "it depends" isn't the ideal answer, but it's the case here. 




 Pick 5: I'd take the 5/4 Taunt over mirror image, but it's probably close

Pick 6: Definitely frostbolt. Frostbolt Is one of the top cards you can get in a mage draft, murloc tidehunter is not very good.

Pick 8: Really don't like ice lance, I'd just take the 2/3.

Pick 10: Twilight Drake over counterspell. Twilight Drake often gets silenced but when he doesn't he's like a chillwind yeti or better. counterspell is ok but not as good

Pick 17: worgen infiltrator, or mana wyrm over mirror image. Not really a big mirror image fan, you probably overvalue it a bit.

Pick 18: your 2 slot is filling up but i'd probably still take faerie dragon over stormwind champ

pick 28: shieldmasta. Curve is important, but you're placing a bit too much importance on it.  Still take really good cards like shieldmasta over mediocre ones like argent squire.

pick 29: you can never have enough frostbolts

 ----------------------

Not horrible but a couple of mispicks. You don't need to deliberate over frostbolt, it's a slam every time unless there's something else like flamestrike, fireball, water elemental, etc

 




 I'll keep waiting for 10 or under, but thanks for the update! 




 Don't fret - many of us have been playing card games for almost 20 years. As long as you keep learning from making mistakes, you will keep improving.

**Step 1: Drafting your arena deck**

Look over tier lists - the following lists are very helpful references. Do not be afraid to do a few drafts directly following the tier lists. The more drafts you do, the more you will get a feel for which cards are very good and which are not, and you can deviate a bit based on personal preference.

http://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1ujhzo/antigrav1tys_arena_draft_tier_list/

http://www.ihearthu.com/trumps-arena-card-rankings/

http://www.ihearthu.com/vivafringes-guide-to-arena/

**Step 2: Draft mana curve**

Ideally, you want to balance tier lists with mana curve. Don't pass up something like Argent Commander for a mediocre 2 drop, but you want to be able to have enough 2 drops to be able to curve out (2 drop on turn 2, 3 drop on turn 3, 4 drop on turn 4). Having around 6 2 drops you can actually play on turn 2 is a good metric to start with.

Practice makes perfect. Although it's work, write down all 30 of your picks (including all 3 cards and what you chose) and post it here. You'll get a critique from a large amount of people who will quickly show you your faults - and if you don't, PM me and I'll look it over. It will be super helpful in seeing if it's the cards you're picking that's the problem.

**Step 3: Draft Classes**

Don't be afraid to pick "overpowered" classes. I pick mage every time it comes up and if mage isn't there, I'll pick paladin. The point of the game is to win. Your mileage may vary, but mage and paladin are generally considered two of the more powerful classes.

**Step 4: Mulligans**

On the play, you want to have a 2, 3, and 4 drop. On the draw, coin gives you options but try for a 2-2-3-4, 2-4-4, or a 3-3-4 start. You generally always want a 2 drop in hand. If you draw 3 4 drops, mull them all, unless one is something really insane. Anything over 4 do not keep is a good arena rule of thumb.

**Step 5: Gameplay**

Always be thinking of what gets you the most value. At worst you want to trade one of your cards for theirs. In general you want to look to get added value. Getting 2 cards with one of yours is how you win games. If you play a shattered sun cleric and trade with the 3/3 taunt bear, you get small value because you traded a 3 drop for a 3 drop but still have the battlecry on another creature. Small value adds up and wins games.

Finally, don't give up - once it clicks, you'll be rattling off 8+ wins every time. Good luck 




 I totally disagree. if this guy can't string together more than 3 wins in arena, the first thing he should do is strictly emulate the guides to see what approaches are known to work. 

Once he gets the basics down and experiences some success, your advice has merit, but until then, if he just plays the way he feels like he won't magically get better. 




 EUIV on sale any time soon? 




 Black Knight is a literal game winner. Eating a shieldmasta or sunwalker is such a huge tempo shift. Worst case he's an expensive Chillwind Yeti, which is obviously worse than Illidan, but it isn't very hard to get insane value from him.

Illidan usually needs to survive a turn to provide good value, otherwise he is kind of mediocre. The Beast is usually just pretty bad. Usually just eats removal and gives your opponent a free guy. 




 [Gallipoli](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082432/)? 




 Why would it be so awful to give every arena deck equal opportunity to be great instead of having to get lucky enough to get the class cards for a good run.

That exists, it's called playing constructed 




 Yeah, 3 is probably ideal, but depending on what the other two cards are, I wouldn't feel too awful taking more than that.

Let's be real, if I was handed a mage deck with 5 flamestrikes, I probably wouldn't complain too hard. 




 Great list, minor disagreements here and there. As mage I do not agree with maxing out flamestrikes at 2. 




 I used towerofthehand.com as my reference. It allows you to put what the last book you finished as a scope, so it will avoid spoilers. 




 Solution: If you don't like playing buggy unfinished games, stop buying games in early access 




 Totally a mystery why people would pick the best arena class if given the option 




 Setting challenges for reading is great, 50 is about double what I'll read this year most likely. Not sure I'd be a huge fan of only being able to read US born authors for an entire year, however. 




 I feel it's fine where it is. It's fairly weak unless you have lots of pump and not a card I'm super happy to pick. 




 The Third Bear by Jeff Vandermeer 




 Blizzard, hotfix the game immediately, we need to take Ice Block out because it's the only card guy who has been playing for four days has a problem losing to 




 **Hearthstone!** 

Blizzard's TCG wildly surpassed my expectations, arena is tons of fun, and I'm really looking forward to seeing where Blizzard takes it next year and into the future. 




 It is also incredible - most underrated game of the year, and in my personal top ten list. If you like old school platformers, particularly Ghouls n Ghosts, snap pick this up 




 Yeah, I see the appeal (though not for me) and liking it is one thing, but I can't imagine people enjoying it so much that it made their top ten lists. Have people here put hours into Divekick? Is there an active online community to it?

In a year with so many good games, I just question seeing it listed above some others. 




 Yes, it is much better than the original 2/2

Yes, hunters are awful

Yes, it wouldn't make hunters OP

No, Blizzard will not buff up a card to be better than the original version of a card they just nerfed about a month ago (hunters were pretty awful back then too) 




 You really think Blood Imp would be a lot better as a 2/2 without stealth? If so I doubt you understand why it's good in the first place. Just because people are currently packing bad cards like Fan of Knives to deal with Warlock Rush doesn't mean that a 1/1 stealth with a super powerful ability would be worse than a plain 2/2 that literally dies to nearly anything other than a hero ability 




 That's besides the point, why would they make a card they just nerfed better than it was originally? 




 Why is Divekick in so many top 10 lists? 




 Making it 1/1 stealth makes it much more powerful than it was originally at 2/2. More powerful than Blood Imp most likely 




 To be fair sacrificial pact at its best is killing your opponents demon for free, which is pretty sick. Card is still awful don't get me wrong 




 Card advantage is important, but the MOST important thing in this game is tempo and curve. In arena, if you miss a turn 1 and 2 drop on the play and don't have a plan, like a turn 4 hellfire or consecration, most cases you won't be able to keep up with a t1 coin into a 2 drop t2 2 drop t3 3 drop t4 4 drop.

From there, it's all about getting card advantage and making value trades. Rarely is there any "drop it and I win" cards like mtg (Gideon Jura in Rise draft, baneslayer angel, etc) 




 Nothing better than sorry spamming a sorry spammer when they preemptively, aggressively, GG you. 




 I am really bothered by the coin sitting in your hand on turn 6+ 




 Puppy Games are an awesome dev, great fresh takes on old school arcade games. Ultratron is a great Robotron 2084 knockoff. I recommend the bundle even though I'm not a fan of having to BTA for steam keys. 




 DO YOU LIKE TO PLAY WITH FIIIIRRE 




 hex 




 This card is currently not playable in constructed, but can be a very good card in arena. It is deck dependent, but in a shaman, paladin, or a low curve deck with lots of guys, it can be insane.

Regarding it being win-more, I don't think that is true. Just because you have minions on board does not mean you are winning. When you drop him, it allows you to instantly make favorable trades and get a ton of value. It lets you trade a 2-drop 2/3 and a 1/1 paladin token for something like a chillwind yeti. In this case you might even be behind on board, and the champion lets you surge back with all sorts of favorable trades.

If you are slightly winning, he lets you get even more value, wipe any threats they have while trading up, and secures his own safety from on board minions. If your opponent does not instantly deal with him, you will likely win.

Certainly an underrated arena card IMO. 




 I don't know about that 




 Fallen Enchantress Legendary Heroes might be worth checking out then 




 You don't think it would be incredibly rude if InXile offered up beta access to all for much cheaper than what actual backers paid the moment it came out? People would have their pitchforks ready. 




 If you think that $60 is too much to ask to opt into a beta, then just wait until release. For them to release the game at any less of a price would be spitting in the face of the people who are the largest fans and backed them on Kickstarter.

The game is speculated to be in the $20-30 range on release, so I don't see what the big deal is.

 




 yeah, it was a totally innocent question too, totally not implying anything 




 The comment thread here literally makes me want to vomit. Could you guys try and dismiss this any harder? Some assholes jack off into this dev's phone and all you can talk about is how she probably faked the whole thing?

 "Cyber Self Harm" (It weirdly exists http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25120783) as it's pretty easy to garner sympathy that way. If it is option b I don't get why she elected to do it on such a small image board, maybe it's because like I said a thread about this on /v/ was just full of people who had no idea who she was.


 Could possibly be option B. How did the image board get that photo of her?


 this seems to be a quest for attention


 blowing it out of proportion


 We can discuss it and condemn them all we went but that won't change a thing.


 As a developer is listing your gender a requirement to get something Green-lighted?


 To me it sounds all fishy...


 she didn't have to state that she was female


 I have a feeling that SJW's are going to use minimal or fake "backlash" or harassment to garner more attention to their creative endeavors


 The victim complex is a million dollar industry for feminism, and you're just seeing it take root in their newest infection via gaming


 With that said, I'm skeptical of this.


Fucking Shameful.

 Contender for most over-hyped game of the year. It was an interesting concept and isn't a bad game per say, but when it came out all I heard was rave reviews and comparisons of this being the next Portal. I bought in, played it for a couple of hours, smirked a few times, and never went back to it. 




 Any comments on how the PC port is? 




 If you do daily quests and are competent at the game you can bust out 1-2 arenas a day. Within a month you will have a good collection, all for free. 




 and so is the individual card limit. 




 It's still 1112 cards vs. 381. 5 times the number of sets may have been misleading although true.

A lot of what you say is pretty misleading as well though. You can't simply discount manafixing, non-basics, etc as "not cards". You can't write off trash, unplayable, limited fodder in MTG without also doing it for Hearthstone. 




 But it's still 5 times the number of sets that hearthstone has available. 




 Lol, look at some MTG standard top 8s lately and you'll realize that's not quite true 




 Because it's popular and people like to be hip and contrarian 




 Because it's an aesthetic choice? Better looking is relative to you. Give me pixels over polygons any day. 




 Maybe it's because some people like these types of games 




 Be prepared to be burnt at the SJW stake!

 http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Davies

He was on lost 




 Yeah I appreciate the backup, just pointing out this guy is clueless 




 he's taking 7 turn 2, and if you arcane intellect turn 3 he's taking 9. That leaves him at 14 and even if he SW:D's your 5/3 wurm, you still have a 4/3 ready to bash him next turn.

I agree it is deck dependent, but if it's burn mage he isn't going to be playing many guys at all and a turn 4 fireball gets the priest to 3 life, card advantage is moot at this point 




 I'm aware

 




 his suggestion was actually

what? wyrm is only 1 mana if you are going to coin on turn 1 why not

Wyrm, coin, mirror image

on turn 2
wyrm mirror image

turn 3

Arcane int.

 




  the guy i was originally replying to said:
 TURN 1
 Wyrm Coin
 Turn 2
 wyrm mirror image.

I definitely didn't say that

 




 So from turn 3 on you just don't play anymore spells until they die?  




 But if he has a SWP he's killing your t1 wurm anyways. 2 SWPs ruins your day, but why would a priest even keep that hand against a mage? 




 Coining into 2 wurms turn 1 gives you 3 additional turn 2 damage at the cost of -1 attack to the second wurm. You would need to get in hits with the second wurm on turns 3, 4, 5, and 6 for coining on turn 2 to be more damage efficient.

TBH I think the difference between the 2 plays is REALLY small anyways so not that it makes much of a difference. 




 so on turn 2 you'd rather have a 4/3 and a summoning sick 2/3 than a 4/3 and a 3/3 that are both able to attack? 




 Interesting line, not sure if it's better to coin on turn 1 or 2. Turn 1 gives you 3 extra damage on turn 2 at the cost of a -1 attack on one of your wurms.

Keeping the wurms at 4 seems good, but assuming it's constructed and not arena, SW:D isn't that highly played anymore (or is it? seems like I've been seeing less and they aren't very good), and you are going to get SW:P'd on his turn 2 if he has it regardless. 




 * T1 wurm - coin - wurm

* T2 mirror entirty -  mirror entity

* T3 arcane intellect, or one of your drawn spells if it gives you a better option


Leaving you with a 5/3 and 4/3 with 4 0/2 taunts the priest is going to struggle to get through. I don't think you wait to play the second mirror entity. Maybe if he has a SW:P turn 2 to kill one of your wurms, but even then I think I'd still just jam both of them out.

 




 It is way better than both of those cards. Assuming it's early in the draft and we're just picking best card, I'll take it over average cards like razorfen hunter, bloodsail raider, reckless rocketeer, etc 




 You don't use the whole card in the example though. Slime is irrelevant to the issue 




 If you need it explained, you get 2+ uses out of eaglehorn bow 




 more like 1.5 cards 




 It isn't a card I'd pick over anything else in arena, but it's definitely a great arena card I'd never be unhappy playing. 




 Magic has its own large set of problems, ranging from social retardation to smug prickish undeserved elitism 




 I never use "well played" unless I lost and you didn't say it yet, or in response to a "well played" from the loser.

Otherwise it feels like aggressive GGing 




 It is definitely a cumulative experience - the more you read, the more you want to read, and the easier it becomes. Find an author or genre you like to read and start there, but don't be afraid to branch out into new genres or experiences. Reading is the best, welcome.

 Then just concede against priests and requeue - problem solved. Just because you don't find playing as or against control fun doesn't mean it should be stricken from the game. 




 It's one of the best cards in the game, I would just craft them. If you're totally free-to-play, you might crack 2 in packs nearly right away, or it could take you months to crack a set. 




 You can always find a way to scum the system. However, the playtime will certainly help more than it will hurt the case of people lying about how much they have played the game. 




 I think they should work on adding a filter to which scores get counted and displayed for you- things like "at least X hours of playtime in game", "at least X games owned", "at least X reviews submitted", "X% of achievements completed", etc.

You can set the default on these and have most users be fine with it, but adding the filters can only help. 




 yeah, that's definitely not true

 This book was really a slog for me. Interesting premise, but horrible, wooden characters. Peter's wife is a walking stereotype. How many times throughout the book does she ask Peter if "this is really happening?" It's pretty clear Shute cannot write women. Commander Towers is unflinchingly rigid and by the book. I had a very hard time believing people would act like this at the end of the world.

The book just follows around these boring lifeless characters who are waiting to die, and don't do anything of note....I don't understand the praise heaped on this book 




 I like Fallen enchantress legendary heroes and civ 5 for reference. Should i get either, neither, both, or something else entirely? 




 GPs are the ideal event for thieves - not even necessarily from the mtg community 




 The game has certainly improved in a lot of ways. They have implemented card crafting, which somewhat alleviates the P2W problem. The game is still not as friendly to F2P as Hearthstone, but it has improved. The introduction of drafts is also a great leveler where you can just focus on that rather than constructed.

They've also implemented drafts and constructed tourneys, which addresses the "not rewarding" problem which certainly existed before - there are actually fun things to do in the game now besides logging in and getting your 3 daily wins.

The game is about as luck heavy as any other CCG is. If this turns you off CCGs probably aren't for you in the first place.

 Pretty much the only 3 tips you need to know to be able to draft, barring card evaluation.

I will usually let myself level 1 spell during level 1 max. I'm ok with leveling insane ones early (still try for 1 max though) like epidemic, twin growth, or spiritleash. If i can get nice value from it, I might play a spell at Lvl 1 that I can play for free the rest of the game like a contagion surge or primal strike. 




 It's pretty great. I've read some of McCarthy before so I sort of know what I'm getting into, but I still really needed to slow down my reading to catch all the details - and I'm really glad I'm reading it on Kindle, because I'm looking up multiple words per page. The prose as you said is fantastic though, I'm maybe a third through and already there are lots of unforgettable scenes. 




 you get tickets, which allow you to enter tournaments, as daily rewards. You can also buy them with silver (which is also accumulated for free), so yes, it is possible as F2P

 I wish they'd run larger daily tournaments or something other than essentially "who plays the most". I have no doubt most of the guys at the top these lists are good and I've run into most of them, but "most wins this week" just isn't a very interesting stat to keep track of 




 Slam that nightgaunt 




 I guess people haven't played a lot with Scarab, because it's insane. Still probably below Strategist and GGP, but Scarab is miles better than Frostwild Tracker and a card I'm pretty happy first picking 




 towerofthehand.com to catch up on what you've already read. I suppose you could skim book 4 this way if you wanted to, but book 5 was pretty similar, so it wouldn't make much sense to do so 




 97 packs, 5 legendaries, 16 heroics 




 I guess I'm one of the few Ramsay fans... 




 I agree, although the only part I really disliked were the Sam chapters. The Cersei chapters are some of my favorites in the series. 




 I tend to check kirkus reviews, the millions, and book beast, but content can be pretty sparse. I was wondering what the favorite sites of others are, to add a few to my daily routine. Thanks 




 The recommendation engine. Like anything else it isn't perfect, but it has lead me to some interesting reads 




 I did it in the past, but found it lead to me not finishing a lot of books, so I try to stick to one at a time now unless I have good reason otherwise. 




 Encyclopedia Brown 




 Thsi book was really a slog. Great premise, horrible wooden characters. Peter's wife is a walking stereotype. How many times does she ask Peter if "this is really happening?" Commander Towers is just unflinchingly rigid and by the book. I had a very hard time believing people would act like this at the end of the world.

The premise is interesting but sadly the book is about following around these boring lifeless characters who are just waiting to die, and don't really do anything of note 




 Except it's only possible in arena, and your opp needed to draft two yseras in the first place. Guarantee it didn't happen 




 I really doubt that 




 Can't go wrong with anything by Flannery O'connor or Cormac McCarthy. I recommend Donald Ray Pollock all of the time, The Devil All the Time and Knockemstiff are both great. These books lean more to the southern gothic genre.

2666 is a great book.

There's a lot of horror on the list that is good as well - Lovecraft, Ligotti, Barron, Bierce, etc - good as well but not really like True Detective aside from the King in Yellow/Carcosa connection. 




 Winds of Winter 




 Frank Bill, Donald Ray Pollock, Nathan Ballingrud, Jeff Vandermeer 




 you're an idiot 




 Ah, makes sense, thanks 




 Probably a dumb question but how do you trigger it on your own turn? 




 To Train Up a Child 




 Or the lack of any wildly popular books on that list - Harry Potter, Hunger Games, 50 Shades, etc. It might be due to where the sample was taken, but I'm guessing it's actually a "books that are more popular percentage-wise in this state than anywhere else" rather than a "most read in each state" list. 




 I feel like the vast majority of people obsessed with speed reading are people that don't read and don't really want to put the effort in, but would still like to acquire the knowledge.

Seems fine for something like a textbook or something forced I suppose, but I'd never want to use the tool while I'm reading for personal pleasure. 




 You don't have to like everything that is popular. Obviously do not read Blood Meridian if you didn't like The Road. There are plenty of other books out there. 




 OK, there is a background to most of the stuff, so maybe Deus Ex Machina is the slightly wrong term. Nonetheless Stephenson continually uses futuristic technology throughout the book to get his characters out of impossible situations, so I think it applies. Certainly didn't make it any less groan inducing... I mean, he uses the Rat Things twice if I'm remembering correctly - don't they also save YT during the snow crash pickup? (In addition to running miles at warp speed at the end to save the day and take down the main villain?) 




 At the end of book Uncle Enzo literally presses a magical button that destroys Raven and all of his glass knives....guess that wraps that up.

The entire book is full of them. The rat thing coming out of nowhere to save the day, the all knowing librarian... 




 Snow Crash 




 This apple is MUCH cheaper and tastier than this orange! 




 poor guy 




 Lol, so many cheating apologists in this thread. He obviously cheated dum dums 




 Good Country People by Flannery O'Connor 




 The Devil All the Time by Donald Ray Pollock, book is just superb. 




 Can someone explain the gameplay to me? Couldn't tell from the trailer. 




 This lady clearly made a big mistake, I just find it funny that the response to this woman lambasting an author without even having read their books, is the mob mentality equivalent - flooding her amazon pages with one star reviews. People are such hypocrites. 




 Katamari Damacy 




 The Devil All the Time by Donald Ray Pollock 




 Banished 




 Lol, condescending much? Not every Solforge player is a whiny child that needs to be punished. Some of us are just looking for reasonable updates, and a reason to keep playing this game. 




 Then don't use crowdfunding next time if it's such a hassle... 




 Fix WWP please, card has been breaking constructed and draft for months now 




 Just picked up this game yesterday, quick question on trading - Started a game and built some light ships to protect trade interests. Once I became involved in a war, all of my light ships got demolished. Some of it was definitely due to me not paying attention, but what is the general method to protect your trade ships when in war? 




 Regarding the border and her husband, I thought it was possibly a doppleganger, so maybe expedition 11 never really left area x after all and they were all dopplegangers that came back.

Great book though, looking forward to the next two. 




 Here is the barometer test if you will like this game. Do you like Super Ghouls n Ghosts? If you do why the hell don't you own this already?

 Man, still waiting on an amazon price match...gift cards need to be spent 




 By no means a literary classic, but a fun read 




 The idea that some classics should be retired or are talked about too much doesnt sit right with me. I would never advise someone not to read a classic  Im not in the business of advising people not to read books. A lot of books are dated, but their time may come again. Classics are classics for a reason even if not all of those reasons, or the books themselves, are truly good. 




 Do your own homework 




 No point, LH is strictly better 




 it's a movie buddy 




 White Chicks 2 




 Years of Refusal is good man 




 Annihilation was great! Can't wait until May for the next part 




 Are you new here? 




 He didn't even ask for roguelikes.

* many items which change your style of play - check
* weapons with different attributes - check
* randomly generated levels - check 




 Just came out on Steam. I am a big roguelike/roguelite fan and have close to 100 hrs in Binding of Isaac. This looks similar but looking to hear if anyone has tried it. 




 There are of course legitimate reasons, but it happens far too often for every case to be legitimate 




 As of recently, I'd say more than 50% of my opponents mysteriously go inactive once it becomes clear they've lost, almost always returning once their timer hits around 2-3 minutes left in hopes that I've left to scum out a win.

Some modes it matters a little more than others (play vs. draft), but it makes the game unplayable in bite sized doses unless you're willing to lose or babysit your opponent for up to 15 minutes while doing nothing.

I understand implementing a turn timer or inactivity timer won't universally be an improvement for all, but something should be implemented by SB to combat this, it's a real enjoyment killer. 




 I haven't read this book in about 15 years. I loved it and reread it a few times when I was younger, and I'm now too scared to give it a re-read as I'm afraid it might be something I won't like anymore 




  And that's great, don't get me wrong. But there's a HUGE difference between when new gameplay mechanics are generated, and when they occupy a significant portion of the mainstream gaming consciousness. And indie games almost NEVER do that.

What a bunch of fluff. Why should game of the year be entwined with popularity? Of course indie games never "occupy a significant portion of the mainstream gaming consciousness", they can't compete with the corporate giants in terms of media exposure.
 




 Who cares, his opinion means nothing 




 no kidding... 




 Mockingbird is still good :) 




  Let's restrict it to books between 1800 and 1920. 




 Best I've found is to use a PS3 controller for games where I'd use the d-pad and a 360 controller if I'd use analog stick.

I know you said you weren't a dualshock fan, but I haven't found anything to be better 




 Mockingbird/A Wrinkle in the Skin are not old, though 




 then don't play it 




 and by unantagonistically, you mean comparing a critically acclaimed game many people here like to games designed for 4 year olds? You're an asshole lol 




 Stick to Call of Duty? 




 nope 




 *With Liberty and Justice for Some* by Glenn Greenwald  




 Reading a book a week doesn't mean you are a shut in. I've pretty easily read 4 so far this year by just reading an hour or two before bed each night. 




 you have plenty of time, you just don't want to do it 




 Libraries are free

  I haven't read a book in 10 years...I would **loose** my mind.

 




 whatever floats your boat chief 




 Why bother eating a steak when there's ramen and easy mac?

 Reading words isn't the same as reading a book. I get what you're saying, and Fallout 1 +2 are great games, but reading dialogue is simply not the same as reading a book. 




 stop watching tv 




 Because it's the quantity that counts, right? They can all spread their knowledge of the man with two penises to the rest of the world 




 That's like saying reading 50,000 words while browsing reddit is the same as reading a book. It doesn't count 




 no

 [Steelheart](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17182126-steelheart) by Brandon Sanderson 




 What are the last five books you read? 




 5 is one of the best in the series, sadly marred by horrible battle load times. It would rival 2 if they fixed the load time issue 




 myth 




 Worth getting for Blood Meridian alone, if you are unfamiliar with it. One of the best novels written in the past 50 years. The greatest living author's masterpiece 




 **PWYW**:

* *The Satanic Verses* - Salman Rushdie
* *Stolen* - Lucy Christopher
* *Abandon* - Meg Cabot
* *Junky* - William S. Burroughs
* *Found* - Margaret Peterson Haddix

**BTA**:

* *A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius* - Dave Eggers
* *Blood Meridian* - Cormac McCarthy
* *On a Pale Horse* - Piers Anthony
 




 I felt the same way as you. Enjoyed the story well enough, but the gameplay was a boring collect-a-thon 




 Andersen Prunty 




 Flannery O'Connor's *Everything that Rises Must Converge* and *A Good Man is Hard to Find* 




 wait til you get 400 more dust from something else 




 If you do you will probably regret it at one point when warriors are the flavor of the month. I disenchanted my nat pagle when i started playing and i'm regretting it now 




 **Beyond Good and Evil** - great game with exploration, puzzle solving, areas that are cut off from you until you acquire new equipment, lots of mini-games(photography etc), good boss battles. Well constructed story and characters, highly recommended.

**Okami** - similar to the Zelda games, great visuals, great gameplay, cool paint mechanics, lots to explore, another big recommendation. 




 Seems like this game is just constantly the daily deal 




 indeed
