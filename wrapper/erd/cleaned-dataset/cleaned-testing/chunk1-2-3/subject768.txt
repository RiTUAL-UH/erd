 Thanks. 




 The official [site](http://www.pivotanimator.net/) even when you go there chrome gets defensive 




 I wanted to make some bootleg animations for some reason. I just want to know is Pivot animator is safe, because I downloaded the exe. and scanned it with VirusTotal. Got a fair few [detections](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/8a7e721b1070a823bc203a01a9978d5eb48802009a76ba5f2b91d8beecd6063a/analysis/) 




 It's edited in... I edited it in.. to cover his picture 




 Good AutoModerator! 




 You should really be a mod on /r/AskScience if you are not already, Bill. 




 I used to love watching your 'Bill Nye The Science Guy' show back in the 90s. I now study A level biology. I'd love to ask what made you so passionate about science?  




 Maybe. But by the looks of his G+ Page all he has is pictures of his l33t 'modded' ps4 




 YOU HAVE A PET ROCK? WHAT?! WHY WAS I NOT INFORMED OF THIS? 




 No I edited that in to cover up his picture xD 




 I don't think it is? :S I hope it is.

  Everybody is welcome here, even those that have yet to ascend.
 You don't need a PC to be a member of the PCMR. You just have to recognize that PC is objectively superior to consoles in every way possible as explained here! It's not about the hardware in your shrine, but the software in your heart!

You were welcome from the start. 




 nice. 




 waaaaaaaaaaat 




 Sorry guys. It's been a weird day. 




 i had tbogt on console... why does GFWL not let you transfer your old xbox games to PC? *sigh* 




 On high? I'm getting an GPU 




 :P 




 I ordered an GPU but it's late. I'm not being an ass.  




 I have a desktop. There is no need to be like this, either help or GTFO. A brother is a brother no matter what PC they have. You should not laugh at other peoples PCs just because yours is better, they might not have the money to spend you have. 




 Finally.  




 We are talking about GTA 4 here. *4* NOT *FIVE* 




 the port for GTA IV is SHIT. Also you know that flair I have. Yeah if you want to mouse over it.. 




 Not bad. Sure. Take it. 




 Oh, Ok. i'd say buy some faster RAM and a GPU i'd say R9 280

I have a core i3 2330M with integrated graphics and 4GB of RAM. I heard that if I fiddle with the .ini files I can make it playable, is that true and what do I have to do? 




 I'm trying to run GTA IV at medium/high i've tried low, still getting 30/40fps... it's terrible. the port is so shit. Any files/mods that can improve the port? :| (If that is possible)
I'm tired of 30fps it's burning my eyes. 




 Hahahaha! *Upvotes* 




 Can you buy a new computer? Do you have a credit-card and a budget i'll help you all Ican(the latest apple product only for $99999.99) man.

 Little April was not the best student in Sunday school. Usually she slept through the class. One day the teacher called on her while she was napping, "Tell me, April, who created the universe?" When April didn't stir, little Johnny, a boy seated in the chair behind her, took a pin and jabbed her in the rear.  "GOD ALMIGHTY!" shouted April and the teacher said, "Very good" and April fell back asleep. A while later the teacher asked April, "Who is our Lord and Saviour," But, April didn't even stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again.  "JESUS CHRIST!" shouted April and the teacher said, "very good," and April fell back to sleep. Then the teacher asked April a third question.  "What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?"  And again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin.  This time April jumped up and shouted, "IF YOU STICK THAT F*****G THING IN ME ONE MORE TIME, I'LL BREAK IT IN HALF AND STICK IT UP YOUR ARSE!" The Teacher fainted.

 Ok so I got a new rig a while back, and I was dumb and I did ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew in CMD and it has fucked my ping up bad brothers! All MP games are unplayable for me! Any way to fix this? :( 




 Sure! 




 Anything..really. apart from RPGs. Sandboxs are fun. I have GTA V but it's at very low settings, and is hardly playable. 30-24fps [horrible.](https://youtu.be/e-LE0ycgkBQ?t=1m2s) 




 That comment is made up. Obviously the writer is a PS4 Fanboy and is actually secretly a wannabe PCMR. And that is his dream PC. let's help him build it., brothers!

The truth is out there. 














 STWBF2 is getting 30fps too. I think it was my temps. It's kinda fixed now i guess, still pretty bad doe 




 Same to you. :( Shame i wanted to play with you 




 I don't have  GPU ;(.....yet... I use an APU. My old card had to be returned because it came from Ebay...broken -.- 




 Tried it. Nothing found. 




 Ok i'll try that.
Edit: Nothing found 




 Well, I was playing GMOD today and I noticed that the FPS was dropping below 30! It's never happened before, I always got ridiculous framerates like 320... why is it doing this?  




 I'd love to play but I play on PC :( Do you play PC too? Or just PS3? 




 thank you brothers 




 love you

 Why not remove some of the useless flairs that are not uses so much like HTPC? 




 No,Yes. 




  It feels like I'm developing for a console :/
HOW DARE YOU? D: 




 D: 




 We are the members. We demand flairs. We want colors. We are not a 1950s newspaper. We are colorful and intelligent. We. Love. This. Sub. 
No longer will we put up with these COLORS.
We will do whatever it takes to get flairs. Even if that means pressing 2000 K70 keys down at once. Prepare your ears, you are in for a ride.  




 It's ok xX_EdGe360n0sCoPeZz_CaSEMasTeRRacE_FazeClanxX_zZ you will soon be part of us.A 




 Why can't we have a few? You know? I'm tired of seeing people use the former PCMR flair. People want orange! Blue is for peasants! #orangemasterrace 

 




 Why not add pages? You know, like a scroll bar! Or somthing? Is that possible in CSS? 




 I was talking like orange and red. You don't have to change anything big... I was maybe thinking like you could remove the color ranking somehow? Mods have exclusive color? The sub would look nicer being more colorful. 




 Yeah! 




 Upvooooohhht if you agree brother! 














 Yeah, fr00b 




 cs:go compet.. if that does not require skill I don't know what does
