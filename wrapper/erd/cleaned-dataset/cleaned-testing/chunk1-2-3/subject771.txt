 Also, large cities in China are targeted for hydrogen bomb drops.  Civilian populations are directly targeted, and Shanghai and Beijing are reduced to radioactive rubble several times over.  Fields and rice patties are targeted for massive bombing campaigns with napalm, and WP bombs.

The USA attacks DPRK, and China with the full force of the military, and we do not relent until they are pounded into complete and utter devastation and defeat. 









 He refuses to make any more televised appearances, and does not give a farewell address on his last day.  He simply leaves when the new president arrives at the office.  No fanfare, nothing.  His term is done.  He gets on Executive 1, and departs without a word to the media. 




 Such as on American TV, they can't even say "piss", "shit" "damned", "hell", or "bastard" without getting bleeped out, and if you say "the lord's name in vain in public, you'll get dirty looks.

But on British TV that I watch, (yes, it's BBC News, and BBC America), they don't seem to care at all.  They'll use them all day long, and nobody gives a shit.  Australlian TV is even more liberal.  They even include the heavy cuss words like "fuck" and "cunt".

So what's up with the cultural differences?  Why are Americans so puritanicall with language, and don't seem to realize that saying "gosh dang it" is just G rated substitution for "god damn it", and "Shut the front door!" is a substitute for "Shut the fuck up!"?  Everybody knows what is being said.  But some words have magical offending properties, while others do not. 

Please explain.

**EDIT:**  I'm surprised "douchebag" is allowed on TV, and "ass" and "hole" are, but "asshole" is not, (on American TV). 


































 Such as, when I speak into the mic, it comes out of my speakers.  In Windows 10, it doesn't do this.  How do I re-enable this feature again? 



















 On every application from Speedtest to downloading on Chrome, the speeds are consistent with my home Wi-Fi connection at 50Mbps.  

However, when I fire up Google Play, the download speeds are measured in Kb, forget about Mbps.  It works in everything else, except for Google Play.  It's slow enough, that updating something 20MB in size takes about 45 minutes.   









 Is there an official ROM for this yet, or is it still a waiting game?  Also, what would happen if I tried to push "Blur_Version.220.21.28.falcon_umtsds.AsiaRetail.en.03.zip" to the USA version?  Would it make any difference as far as the baseband is concerned?  Would it nuke the phone? 






























































































 I tried DD-WRT, but now I run Tomato v26RT-N.  It works fine, but I'm wondering if there are any more OSes that are supported on the e1000 router. 





































































 Also, what would they think/say if a person said something like:

"Probably living in a 40 year old doublewide trailer, using kerosene for heat, and propane and wood for cooking. Still working for below minimum wage, and using a generator backed up by a UPS, solar, wind, and a bank of car batteries; for the minimal electricity I need to survive." 





























 My cat somehow figured out how to fire up WMP, and start up my play list.  Fucking rude awakening, but at least it wasn't a bad song.  I was just clueless on how it got fired up until I closed all of my browser windows. 
























 Mildly fucked up at work today. Was cashiering, and I put all of their merchandise back in the buggy since I was running out of bags. She asked, "Where's my shit?" So I said back, "I put all your shit back in the buggy. I mean stuff. I put your stuff back in the buggy. Oops, sorry about that." She laughed, and didn't care that I slipped up. I think because she started using cuss words first, so I just responded how I naturally would.

 I don't care if it's in Pullman or Moscow, (I work in Moscow though).  I would LIKE a 2bdrm 1 ba (1 for my bedroom, one for a shop/cat room). But a 1bdrm 1 ba would be adequate.  (Yes, I want the cat to have her own room).  Bedrooms are typically fine with the lighting in every place I've had, but I like natural light in the kitchen and bathroom.  (save on energy bills).  It must be pet friendly.  Are there apartments like that around here?  I have one cat.  

Glendimier would suit me, but I don't like that the bathroom doesn't appear to have a fart fan, or any natural lighting, and the kitchen doesn't have any natural lighting.  What options do I have around here? 


















































































































 I fixed the errors I was getting with Windows Update by completly removing Microsoft Office.  WU works fine now, but now I cannot install MSO 2013 on my computer.  The installer launches, but then hangs and force closes.  Is there a way to make it install?

 Went to WM to get soda and dinner, and went through the self-checkout. Those machines are SLOW! I was trying to haul ass like I do at work, but I was faster than the damned machine. It's like they design it for people who don't know what the hell they are doing, and have no realistic expectations of speed.

They need to crank up the response time of those machines. I hate going slow in the checkout lane. Cashiering at WM has taught me how to haul ass doing it, and having to slow down because the machine can't keep up is annoying! 






















































 I know like 3 "phrases" in ASL, (4 if you count the middle finger), but in "universal sign language", language barriers simply don't seem to matter.  While I know not *exactly* what is trying to be communicated, I can get the gist of it.  So why was ASL ever formed in the first place, since "universal sign language" works fine 90+% of the time? 


















































































































 Looking for a new job. No I didn't get canned. I still have the job for as long as I want it, (realistically). I'm just getting tired of the irregular shifts, the inadequate hours, having to schedule myself, and dumb-ass customers who don't know where a buggy is even if I hit them in the ass with it. I've filled out a job app, and I'm wanting out of WM.

If I had 40+ per week, with a regular schedule, and didn't have to do 5 GOD DAMNED JOBS just to get SOMETIMES CLOSE to 40 hours a week, If I didn't have to work 6 days a week, and if I didn't have an irregular schedule, I would LOVE WM! But all of those things haven't happened, so I'm looking for new work.

If I'm successful in getting the job that I'm now applying for, I will like it better than WM. I'll be working M-F, with a REGULAR SCHEDULE and A REGULAR WEEKEND! I WANT THIS JOB! I'm getting sick of retail. Realistically, I'm getting tired of the shitty work situation. I'll give them a 3 week's notice, because I want to finish out my schedule, and give them adequate time to hire my replacement.

To quit immediately would be rude, and I would burn more bridges than it's worth. If I do get this job, it will be the first job I quit in my adult life, instead of getting fired from it. I just want out. I want a regular job, with a regular schedule, doing a regular job. I'm tired of working 5 jobs at 1 employer just to get CLOSE to 40 hours. I also miss O/T. Can't do that at WM!

A lot has changed in 10 years. The last time I worked at WM, I could put in 70 hour weeks, and nobody cared. Now, if I get 40.03 hours, I get a verbal warning to watch the clock. Can't do it. Can't work over 40, or I get my ass chewed. Sick of it. I want out. 



















 Not to keep people in, but to keep people out.  There is a 1KM wide "No Man's Land", and there are landmines, attack dogs, automatically firing machine guns hooked up to motion sensors, armed drones, and border guards are told to "take no prisoners, but shoot on site any intruders".  We use the technology developed by the DDR and current DMZ in Korea to make an impenetrable border. 



















 They also set off an atom bomb at the base of Hoover Dam, and blast it into non-existence.  What happens now? 







































 Every time I try to vote on something, it says "Your vote cannot be cast at this time".  Why? 























































































































 The guy buying all of the stock thinks that slavery is morally wrong, but only sees one way out of it for them.  He "buys" them, then sets them free.  Tells them to head north, and gives them a compass, and a watch. 


































 I came to a stop, put my rig in neutral, set the brake, and ran out and saw if the dude was OK. He was fine, but the engines shit out on him, so I called 911. I was a few counties over in Shoshone county. I damned near shit a brick because a DAMNED PLANE ALMOST LANDED ON ME!  That dude scared the fucking shit out of me.  I heard a "WUNK" on my roof, so I backed off, (what the fuck was that?) then I hear the plane again, and it touches down. 

 HOLY SHIT!  DOWNSHIFT!  DROP THE CLUTCH, NEURAL! 911!  OH FUCK  I'M GONNA KILL THIS GUY!  OH SHIT!  I stopped 30 yards back.  Then I'm on the phone after I see if the guy is still alive.  Scary shit!  STAY NEXT TO THE PLANE!  STAY STILL!  Turns out he ran out of gas, and had to land, so he just went for the nearest highway, and he accidently tried landing on me.  After he hit my roof, he took another pass, (faster), and landed ahead.  WTF?  

**EDIT:** paragraphs 









 Right now, shit's going real bad.  I'm about ready to be homeless, and the only thing I'll have left is what I can haul on my back, and my cat.  Unless change happens really soon, I'm going to end up homeless, and I'll be resorted to armed robbery to pay the bills.  My SIL is even leaving.  I don't know what to do, but I'm going to soon lose everything unless shit changes really fast.  The thought of doing a hostile takeover because of an emergent situation has never occurred to me, but I'm about ready to go knock over a service station.  Right now, I basically have nothing to lose, so why keep alive? 





































































 Except for potentially killing myself if I build it wrong, what If I do it, and set it off?  Also, how to do so safely in town?  OK, I might build 2, and torch them off, but what would happen if I got caught?  Is it worth the risk?  I wouldn't be using them as weapons, just to make a hell of a boom, (and run like my ass is on fire because nitro). 
























 Drop trou, and fuck it in the ass. 














 Since tasers are LTL options, (like I as a civillian have the option of pommelling you with my knife, or turning it around and spearing you with it, and after that drawing a gun and stopping you), but if I pommeled a person to stop a threat, (Ideally I don't want to get that close if I have to use it), I would be arrested if I hit somebody in the temple and accidently killed them even if it was self-defense.  Then released because if I'm drawing a weapon and was using proper escalation of force, then no charges filed in WA state).

But what happens if a cop pulls a taser, uses it, and the guy drops dead?  Would an investigation occur?  I personally won't pull anything on anybody unless I intend on using it, and am pretty sure I might have to. 














 Such as lines instead of saying "Then I told him that he's clueless", they wrote something like "All y'all don't know jack shit, eh?  Fuck ya!" 









 Oh, and what's your thoughts to "Not yet.  I just got off of work, I'm going home to do exactly that."  I got stopped 4 days ago because my headlight was out of alignment and I was apparently blinding him when I passed.  He smiled when I said that, then it was back to business.  Now I have to figure out how to re-align my head light. 









 The only time I was terminated from a job, (and borderline suicidal), I used my sunglasses to hide my emotions  They couldn't tell anything was wrong since I had my eyes covered. 





























 Then a police officer grabs me, (one hand on my shoulder, and one hand on my right hand to restrain me).  Why did he do that?  I spun around and was about ready to deck the guy because I though somebody was going to rob me, but I stopped once I recognized that it's a cop, and not somebody going to rob/assault me.  So why did he feel the need to mildly restrain me, to risk getting punched in the face?  

Once I saw it was a city officer, I stood down, but I thought it was some random dude trying to stop me from getting away from the several mortars about ready to shoot off.  He should have shouted over his bull horn, eh?

He asked me if I owned this road, and told him "no, but nobody else is using it eh?  so I'm setting off fireworks."  He stood there and watched the fireworks with me, then ran my background info, then told me not to set off fireworks in a public roadway.

  Then he told me to pack up my shit and go to the parking lot if I'm intent on setting off fireworks, so I did.  He shook his head, and took off. 




 Ever since updating to 10051, the start menu doesn't work, and nor does Project Spartan.  I ran sfc /scannow, to try and fix it, but that didn't do anything for those two issues. 



















 How do I fix it?  I can still launch shit with the search function, but start is completely non-functional. 




 Stopping people for minor traffic violations, (didn't signal, broken headlight on passenger side, and turned into the far lane) just to get a verbal warning, and when they stick their head in the rig, it's obvious that they're trying to smell drugs/alcohol, so I suspect that was the "real reason" for the stop?

Is that a thing, or am I paranoid?  No, I wasn't drinking, Just nobody was there, so I pulled into the left lane.  I got let off and basically told "don't do that", then sent on my merry way.  This just happened, if it helps. 




 Such as a brown bear, you make yourself bigger and charge it if you can.  The bear will likely be scared off, as it now thinks you're a threat to it

Dogs, slowly back off while not turning your back, always locking eyes with it, (if you turn and run, it will kill you).

Large cats, you stop moving, and slowly back off, never losing eye contact.  Get to safety, but slowly.  If you run, you're now the prey, and it will kill you.

Gators, RUN. If you run your ass off, they'll give up after a few meters.  Try and stare down a gator, you're not gonna have a good day. 




 While driving down the road, how do police decide to not stop somebody going VERY FAST (2-3 times the speed limit, running lights (reasonably safely, but emergently) , and blaring his horn and having on the 4 ways while flashing his high beams), Is it because he's on the phone to 911 and talking to dispatch as it happens "live", or some other reason?

When my wife cut her hand on a stupid-ass soup can, I was honestly faster than the ambulance, so "get in my truck and buckle up.  We're hauling ass".  After she got in my rig, I went 65 through town through 20 zones, and police actually got out of my way.  

I was heading the most direct rout for the hospital that I possibly could, and had my 4 ways on and was jumping lights.  I think it was pretty damned obvious that it was an emergency, ( I normally don't drive like that,  eh?)  But they knew to get out of my way and close down intersections somehow.  Is it because I was on the phone to dispatch ( 911 ), while I was rushing to the hospital as fast as I felt safe going?  

No, I didn't jump lights if it was unsafe, but if there was a gap, I did the left, right forward?  CLEAR  thing?  While I ran several lights, and wouldn't have stopped until the hospital, (then surrendered, because somebody bleeding to death on me), everybody (including several emgergency vehicles were just getting out of my way.  About half way there, I got a lead rig and a pilot rig.  How did they know that I needed a police escort when all I gave on the phone was present location, description of the vehicle, license plate number, and direction of heading?  How the fuck did the cops know not to stop me, clear the roads, and take me to the hospital? 





























 How does one adopt non-local vernacular?  I've adopted several sayings, and I honestly have no clue where I got them from.  I'm a native to Eastern WA, (Whitman County).  I've managed to pick up the following words and I don't know how or why:

Buggy = "shopping cart"

Y'all = "You all / you guys / you"

Eh? = "Huh? / what? / right? / yeah?"

Sup = "What's up?"

Pillock = "Dick"

Arse = "ass"

Thank god I didn't adopt "cunt", or "hoser", eh? 

Sorry if this a "shit post", (whatever the hell that is), but I don't know where else to ask this.

And why don't people know what a buggy is?  I don't get it.  "shopping cart" now sounds dumb to me. 









 Because God doesn't trust the English in the dark, eh? 
























 I have 2GB of RAM installed, if it matters. 
























 To me, it's a 4 wheeled thing you shove around a store to load your shit in.  I met an Alaskan today, and he thinks it's a strange moterized vehicle that looks like a rock crawler, but designed for mud.  Around here, we call those  "rock crawlers".

He was talking about how much shit he can fit in his buggy, and I was getting confused, so I said "buggy?  you mean that thing that you do this with in stores?", (did the buggy shoving gesture).  He then tried to describe what he meant, but I still had to guess.  I had no clue what he was talking about for about 3 min, until I asked, "like a rock crawler?" 




 Like "g CZ52" and it goes through Google, but if I type "b CZ52", it does the same search but through bing? 




 If I do it, it's armed robbery and I face 10-life. If the government does it, it's tax collection, and publicly applauded. 




 A black hole. Because once you go black, you never come back. 





























 Why not?  I have it connected through FB.

 In WA, I don't think I can conceal my ka-bar, (because of the "dangerous weapons" law, but in ID, I can, so long as I have an ID LCCW, or WA CPL.  I called the police, and while I can open carry basically anything I want, I can't "Furtively" carry any dangerous weapon, (except pistol since I'm licensed to do so).  So why the law difference?

Also, is it a good idea to inform, even though I don't have to?  I got in a collision back in 2012, and an officer responded.  After asking for DL/reg/ins, 

I gave him all the paperwork, and also gave him my CPL, and told him that "Since I'm armed today, here is my CPL."  He just looked at it, asked me where it as, and said "cool, if you don't touch yours, I won't touch mine."  I didn't care, but I felt like I should inform the officer even if I legally don't have to. 



















 I was formally employed as a cashier/assembler/toy sales associate/cart associate/freight unloader at Walmart, and recently left that job.  I got a new job as a landscape maintenance technician, and MY GOD, the labor is hard work!

Before I worked at Walmart, I was a car wash guy, and before that, I was a groundskeeper.  I don't remember how long it took me to adjust to manual labor, so I'm asking here.  It's Saturday, and my muscles still hurt from the work week.

 Some people are wondering where Montgomery Ward's is, as it was just there yesterday, but now it turned into a Big 5 overnight. 









 Just for shits and grins, I burnt a DVD, and decided to re-install.  A USB drive takes all of 20 min, (max), but from a DVD, it takes over an hour to install the OS.  MS should by default provide USB drives to install the OS, and have them fill out a form if they want a DVD, (like was done until Windows XP, with shipping CD's and including a card that if you want FDD's to write MS)

MS should transition to USB installation.  Installing W10 with a DVD is the first time I've even used that drive since 2010. 
























 Some of them are wondering where Montgomery Ward's is, because it used to be there yesterday, but it's now a Big5 over night.

 I tried to replace the front glass, (not very sucessfull).  I got the front glass off, but the LCD was still stuck to the screen, even after heating it up with a hair dryer.  at first, none of the buttons except for power and volUp and VolDn were working, so I took apart the phone completly, (MB, and screen/bezel assembly as one unit) and noticed that a connecter came loose on the touch screen link to the lower buttons.  

I got the home, menu, and back buttons to work again, but I still can't use the touch screen at all.  It simply doesn't recognize input.  Is there a way to fix the touch screen?  It displays everything fine, but input via touch is now impossible.  Is there a connecter that I may have missed?  I would like to not spend $71 if I don't have to buy a new front screen/bezel assembly.

**EDIT:**  Well, now that I tore it apart again, and put it back together, the phone won't turn on at all.  :(  Fuck.  Now it looks like I'm going to have to buy one. :(  I'm now back to my backup phone, which is a i997 flashed with CM11 (unofficial) 4.4.4.  Do you think I EMPed it by accident? Even plugging it in, it won't signify charging at all. 



















 

The phone identifies as an i9300 in the sticker in the back of the phone, and in the ROM. However, when I boot into download mode, it shows up as an i747, and trying to flash a i9300 ROM fails. Is there a way to resolve this? 




 MS!  GET RID OF THE "LESS OPTIONS" IN TASK MANAGER!  It's Fucking USELESS!  I can't use it for shit!  "More Options" should be the default, (and only option for task manager).  The way it's set up now, it's little more useful than the task bar!  If I go Ctrl+Shift+Escape, I WANT THE FUCKING TASK MANAGER!  WHY DO YOU TORTURE US LIKE THIS?  

The way its used now is fucking retarded and useless!  Get rid of it!  Bring the old style back!  OK, done rant now.  But seriously, whoever thought of that needs to be bitch slapped! 









 "Fuck the police!"  I'm not talking about spouting off at the mouth, but making his land a deadly trap to anything that moves.  Anything that intrudes is shot on site.  Now what?  They will not be negotiated with.  They have RPG-7's, and aren't afraid to use them.  Prisoners ar taken, and severely tortured on live TV before execution. 



















 Example:  We got in WWII because of the Jewish holocaust.

No, we didn't.  We didn't even recognize them until 1943, when the war machine was starting to lose support, so it was revealed to the American public about execution camps, so we must fight the evil. The USA actually turned back Jewish refugees in 1938, because we didn't want them either.  (Source:  http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005267 ) 

We REALLY got involve in WWII because we embargoed the japs for oil, so we got struck in the territory of HI, so we declared war on them.  Then, since JP was allied with GE, they declared war on us.  Boom!  WWII.  The rest is history as we know it.

Anyhow, how do these modern propaganda stories get passed down as fact, when they are incredibly wrong, and why do people believe it, when even a modicum of research would prove it wrong? 




 If you aren't liberal, you're "not a true atheist". The only thing missing is worship of a deity. Oh wait, most "practicing" atheists these days do worship something. Government has taken the place of a god. So it's a secular religion for most "practitioners" of atheism. If you don't comply to the "doctrine", you will be rooted out, and banned on FB. Small minds think alike, eh? Yeah, they're "tolerant", so long as you agree with them. 




   Would Obama start cussing to nobody in particular while live on the air?  How far would he get before the networks cut away from him or he realized he was uttering a stream of profanities before he stopped talking and left the stage? 

















































 My cat is an indoor cat, but a few times she has gotten outside, she doesn't even leave the property, and when I had her at my old place, (an apartment), she never left the stoop of my place.  

But she swill wants outside even though she never leaves my property, (a tenth of an acre).  She even restricts herself to the front lawn when she does get out. She's not a wanderer, so why does she even want out?  When the weather's nice, I leave open a couple of windows so she can look out, but she still wants out. 









 It is done so nobody calls the air force to report a UFO and strange lights all over America that cause the sky to glow all night long for over 4 weeks.  (basically "Oooh, look at the pretty lights!" is what it is passed off as).

But here's the catch:  The test is really to see what a HEMP would do the CONUS, and the test is not only hailed as a "progress of mankind" or some such bullshit, but it's really a covert mission to EMP the entire USA before the fucking Russians can do it, just to take the "wind out of their sails".

Now what?

 Anybody else remember the first time they heard of "green tech"?  I first heard of it when my boss said "We're going to make our workplace green".  My reaction was "Ew, Why?  Green's an ugly color.  Why would anybody do that?  What the fuck?  But if you want me to paint the houses green, OK."  I got laughed at and I didn't know why.

 Horse style, doggy style, any style!

 Oh dear!

 No, no! Deer run too fast. 












































 Back in 96, I crossed into canada on a band trip.  I got asked 3 questions:  

1.  Do you have any weapons in the vehicle?  (my knife)
1b.  OK, do you have any firearms in the vehicle?  (no)

2.  How long to you plan to be in Canada?  (a week, I want to go to the Edmonton Mall, and I play the bass drum in the percussion section, I'm on a band trip).

3.  Business or pleasure?  (pleasure)

On re-entry into the USA, I got asked one question:

1.  Are you a lawful resident of the USA? (yes)

It was easy to cross international borders then.  Now, I need a passport, and documentation to prove that I'm legally in the USA to even leave, let alone get back.  It's fucking retarded.  Back in 96, I TRIED to show my ID, and they had me put it away, and said "verbally, are you authorised to be in the United States?" I responded, Uh, yeah?  Why else would I be on this bus?  The INS guy just shook his head and said "You'd be surprised", and kept on moving down the line.  

We almost got stopped because we had a russian immigrant aboard, and I'm glad we didn't, because I bought a CO2 pistol in Canada, and was smuggling it across international boundaries.  And some chew too. :)  

But these days, I can't even go to Canada, (or reenter the USA legally), without a passport or an EDL.

**EDIT:** It seems like we're becoming the USSR, and employing the exact same practices we used to ridicule them for.  I guess "Welcome to the USSA:  Land of the Fee, Home of the Slave." 














 I have a 15" sub that's been doing nothing for the last decade. it still worked when I took it out of my rig back in 2002, and I just never got around to installing it again. I realistically will never install it in my vehicle again, but I don't want to get rid of it because it cost me over $500 back in 1999. I want to hook it up to my home audio system. How would I go about doing this? It's just the speaker, not amplified. 









 How well does it work for decrypting QAM channels? 


































 I have a budget of $100. I need to be able to pick up QAM and ATSC TV. Also NTSC, as there is 1 repeater here that still broadcast in NTSC, and the local cable system (basic service), is analog still. What is the best tuner that I can get for under $100? I have money now, so I want a decent tuner for under $100. Antenna isn't really an option here, according to my TV Fool report: www dot tvfool dot com /?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3df1f0978977115 e]. I want ATSC capabilities because I might some day move to an area where I can pick up OTA signals, and an NTSC tuner because we still have an analog cable system here for Extended basic service.
 














 If you go to your clock/calander in the taskbar, single click on it to bring up the calander, and click "more clocks", you get an option for an alarm clock, world clock, countdown timer, and stopwatch. :)  ABOUT TIME!  Now I don't need third party software to do all of this. :) 

















































































































































































































 Such as a 20" CRT TV is easily watchable from 10 feet away, but a 20" LCD TV is hard to make out what is going on on the screen.  Forget about trying to read any text from 10 feet away on a LCD when watching something in SD format. 
























 What is a fairly decent ATSC/QAM box for my TV?  It would be nice if it could receive NTSC signals too, so I wouldn't need to jockey between using the remote for the TV, and the remote for the box, but just use the box.  I have a budget of $100.  Any recommendations? 



















 Microsoft's new browser, formally referred to as "Project Spartan" is officially going to be called "Microsoft Edge".

I wonder if they'll use Aerosmith's "Livin' On The Edge"  to market it, like they used "Start Me Up" from the Rolling Stones to market Windows 95? 





























 Surround baltimore with concentra wire, and make it a "no-go" zone. Ban the media from entering because of "security reasons". Cut the phone lines, power, and water. Disable cellular service, and internet access. Don't respond to any emergencies, and let the place burn down. Close down the hospitals. Nothing gets in or out except for food, which will be air dropped once a day in the form of MRE's. Let it burn. Because of the scum there, that city would shortly turn into a 3rd world hell hole making Mogadishu look like Disney World. They hate police and emergency responders? Fine. Let's see how well they get along without them at all. 























































































































 It's no longer on channel 9, instead I'm getting a station called "Antenna TV".  Where did Fox28 go on the analog feed? 









 [Slow-moving vehicle to pull off roadway.](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.427)

Why does this need to be a law? If you're holding up traffic, PULL OVER! NOT HARD PEOPLE! (queue flashback to 2002 when I threw an engine rod on the Lewiston Hill, and drove in the shoulder, called my mom because my engine blew up, pissed in my radiator just to make it to WA state line to shut off my engine). 

Fuck. If you're holding up traffic, PULL OVER! The Lewiston hill is beautiful at 7MPH, and it takes about an hour to get up it, even flagged by the state bull.  Let them pass, keep on your way, and only get back in the lane once you let everybody by, (optimally, just drive on the shoulder).
 




 I ask because my DL is about to expire, and I honestly can't afford the renewal fee.  I know I can operate a Moped on a standard DL, but what if I can't afford to renew it?  Can I run an electric scooter legally?  Yes, I will wear a helmet.  

If it's faster than a bike, I wear a helmet, (even if only a bike helmet).  I got saved once by a helmet, and I'm not riding anything that has power behind it without one).  But if I can't afford to renew my license/registration, can I get on my scooter and go to work?

I'l keep off of the public highways when I can, but if there's no sidewalk or shoulder, then I'll keep in the right lane.  Do I need one of those orange triangles on my back, (because I'm going less than 35).  No, I'm not getting on the interstate. 









 I'm in Eastern WA, and I just heard a couple robins chirp outside of my window.  Time is now 0148, and it doesn't even start getting light until around 0542.  Why are they chirping in the dark?  WTF? 














 I'm not sure where to put this, as it's not on a physical Macintosh, but it's on a emulated PPC running in SheepShaver on my Windows 10 installation.  I have gotten 9.0.4 up and running fine, but when I try to download the free 9.1 update to MacOS from Apple, it just redirects to Apple Support.  It appears that they have pulled it. Where can I get the free 9.1 update?

 When I upgraded to 10056, I downloaded the wrong ISO, and accidentally changed my Pro TP into Enterprise TP.  I really don't have a need for Enterprise, so when the next release is made available, can I just upgrade the build to Pro, or will I need to clean install?
