 that's way more coherent than what i used as my facebook status update. of course, i was drunk at the time, as that was the only way i could muster up enough courage to hit the "post" button.

that letter pretty much says everything you need to say.  good luck! and of course, if you need to talk, we're always here. 




 nope 




 i'd say both 




 it DID say "early" results 




 nobody said science had to be boring 




 Power density (or volume power density or volume specific power) is the amount of power (time rate of energy transfer) per unit volume.

Supercapacitor power density is typically 10 to 100 times greater than for batteries and can reach values up to 15 kW/kg. 




 i know plenty of trans girls who, when they first come out, go uber ultra femmy femme femme. and then after awhile, slowly drift towards andro. i also kinda hate them because the ones i know look awesome at ANY point of the gender spectrum, boy, girl, AND inbetweeny.  




 when i was first out buying girl clothes, i was so nervous because i thought the sales people would judge me with their judging eyes. but i soon realized that nobody gives a shit. 




 rule of thumb is that the younger you start the better. but, as you get older, the effect of hormones is different from person to person, so YMMV 




 *sigh* that sounds like my dad. way back when, he actually helped his friend transition. but the second i came out, he sed that he "didnt believe that being trans was a real thing" and asked if i had "tried not being trans?" yes, he actually used the x-men question. (no he has never seen the movie)

every time he posts on facebook about me, it starts off with "My son..."

i've been transitioning for almost 3 years. smh 




 no prob, i know it get confusing. 




 The Blade is the oldest LGBT newspaper in the United States and second largest by circulation,  originally launched by a group of volunteers as an independent publication in October 1969. It's  often referred to as America's gay newspaper of record because it chronicled LGBT news locally, nationally, and internationally 




 i didnt know it either, i totally thought they were hard bits of soap too. 




 hell, I didnt know WPATH was based there til i went looking. good luck tho! i totally understand about wanting a female therapist to talk to. i lucked out when i went a'googlin' for mine. i found her a block away.

 yeah, i know they say that they dont require a court order any more, i was sure asked for one at the dmv. the court doesnt keep a record of your gender other than when you file the application for name and/or gender change.

at the DMV, they required the DL-44, which is the application for new license, and a DL 329, which must be completed by a licensed U.S. physician or psychologist.

but in addition,  they required a court order, Form NC-230, to go along with it. 

i dont think they updated their procedure, cuz people at the dmv and SSA were pretty confused. the court order made it way easier. that little piece of paper carries a lot of weight to it.  




 no, i'm a trans girl, who was assigned male at birth. and i like girls, so that makes me a lesbian. sex and gender are two separate things 




 http://t-vox.org/newtvox/medical/therapists

also try maybe finding a trans meetup group in your area, it'll give you an opportunity to go in girlmode. 




 that raises ALL kinds of Nature vs Nurture questions. i'm glad you're happy tho.  




 well, i just changed my name and gender in feb, and you have to go thru the court if you want to change it with the dmv and social security. 




 you're not alone, there are many  others who were or are currently in your situation. i've known a few couples who stayed together, a few who didnt. but i know this, you have to see a therapist. you're tearing yourself apart right now. make the appointment, tell your  wife that you're seeing a therapist to help with your gender identity. if they're a good therapist, bringing your wife along to a few session wouldnt be a bad idea either. i've known some couples to work thru transition together this way. there are many other bridges to cross, but they comes way later down the road. this is the one you have to cross now. 




 it took me about a year before i started seeing the girl look back at me in the mirror. we're often our own worst critic. i think it finally clicked when i was talking to a bank rep on the phone and she gendered me female. it dawned on me that everyone around me was gendering me female, even people on the phone who couldnt see me. i was pretty much a girl in all aspects of of my life. it was only then that i stopped worrying and relaxed enough to actually enjoy this crazy journey. 




 i'm not the one arguing against gravity. 




 ok, first off, i have to start by saying that the only person who can know if you're trans or not is you. if you can, make an appointment with a gender therapist, because they're the best equipped to help you figure out any questions you might have about your gender identity.

that said, i've known i was trans since i was 7, i saw a documentary on a group of trans women prostitutes working to save money for their transition. in my head i knew i could "switch to be a girl!" of course, i spent the next 33 years fighting myself, because just like you i'd go thru periods where i'd be fine with myself, and other times where i'd just YEARN to be a girl.

and it IS exhausting. after years of frustration and depression, it just got to a point where i ran out of energy. i broke down and went to go see a therapist. and started transition pretty soon after that.  




 at least y'all get it covered. we here in the states are shit out of luck unless we have decent insurance, obamacare notwithstanding. 




  For ages there was no proof either of the US spying on their own citizens. Hell, there isn't proof that Israel owns nukes. That doesn't mean shit if you can connect the dots and draw your own conclusions.

again, you said that the CIA was out to get Chavez. that's a pretty bold claim. perhaps you have an inside track on some information that the rest of the world doesnt. please, share with the class. until you do, i'll file it away with the rest of the conspiracy theories.


and as far as communist countries go, if you want to argue semantics, go ahead, the UN classifies them as communist, so i'm going with it, pretty simple.

There is no active war against communism

ok, thanks, we're done 




  What, to correct you at the expense of being snowden-ed? Go find out for yourself. Look at the most recent 2002 coup, for example. The US admitted to meeting representatives of the Venezuelan opposition.

right, no proof, gotcha. thanks.

A communist state is a country run primarily on the principles of Marx and Engels with the end goal being the establishment of communist ideology worldwide. 

"Communist state" is a state that aims to achieve Socialism and then achieve Communism. Most communist states have been states with a form of government characterized by single-party rule or dominant-party system by a party which claims to follow communism, usually with a professed allegiance to Marxism-Leninism as the guiding ideology of the state. None of these states achieved communism, and the term is used no matter to what degree that state or the movement associated with it actually follows communism, if at all. nonetheless, they are considered communist. 

 Furthermore, both the war on drugs and on communism are very obviously connected by the effects they have on US foreign policy towards the Latin American region and therefore geopolitics.

we're not living in the 50's. there is no war against communism. that died when nixon went to china. the cuban exiles who are still mad at castro are fast becoming the minority. any conversation in miami today will show you that, and the polls show it as well.



 




 You may not believe in CIA actions against Chavez

if can point to a single shred of evidence that the CIA in your words "went after" Chavez, i'd be happy to stand corrected.

And of course China, Vietnam, North Korea and Cuba differ politically. Mostly because none of them are communist states.

this statement is so ludicrous, i cant even.

The Communist Party of China is the sole governing party of China, which  is organized on the basis of democratic centralism, a principle conceived by Russian Marxist theoretician Vladimir Lenin which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies.

The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a single-party state. A new state constitution was approved in April 1992, replacing the 1975 version. The central role of the Communist Party was reasserted in all organs of government, politics and society. Only political organizations affiliated with or endorsed by the Communist Party are permitted to contest elections. 

According to policy experts and news reports, including the BBC World Service, North Korea continues to embrace a communist ideology and is a de facto communist government. In 2014, for example, the BBC Country Report on North Korea characterized it as a nominal communist government

The Communist Party of Cuba is the only political party permitted in the Republic of Cuba, others are not allowed to exist. It is a communist party of the Marxist-Leninist model.

The war against drugs and the war against communism aren't separate issues.

yes they are, because they're not even remotely connected to each other in any way shape or form.

However most of them are strongly anti-Castro.

again, you're wrong. Nearly 600,000 U.S. travelers went to Cuba last year  the majority of them Cuban Americans. 

http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/poll-cuba-obama-cuban-americans-florida-116570.html

http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/11/us-cuba-usa-poll-idUSKBN0M72KO20150311

Regardless my point is that it's in Cuba's better interests to seek trade opportunities in solidarity with the latin american nations instead, even if only to maintain its economic sovereignity from the US. 

once the embargo is lifted, cuba can establish ties with whichever country they want to. right now, they cant, because the trade embargo penalizes countries and corporations who do business with cuba. 




 well first off, it's not polite to ask a trans person if they've had surgery. and trans dudes exist too, it's not just women. there's more to a person than which bathroom we use. but to answer your question, far more trans women get harassed and assaulted in women's restrooms. you know how women have been assaulted by trans women in women's restroom? none. zero. nada. zilch.  




 Venezuela is socialist, not communist. and i'd love to see proof that the CIA "went after" him. otherwise, stop peddling that conspiracy theory crap.

and Cuba is communist, like vetnam, china, and north korea, and you can see that communism is very different in each of those countries. 

you cant mix up socialism either, because Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Sweden, and Norway are all socialist countries too.


you keep mixing up the war against communism and the war against drugs, both of which are equally ludicrous. the faster the US decriminalizes drugs the better. hopefully marijuana will be legal in more states by 2016 and mdma, lsd, and mushrooms will be taken off the banned list of drugs so that research can be conducted.

and finally, the US lies 90 miles away from the cuba, it is GOING be the biggest trading partner. miami might as well be another cuban city. the ties run too deep. 




 uh, which part in south america? the drug war is what is screwing up the economies of south america, not communism. besides, cuba is in the Caribbean, not south america. besides, are you actually advocating that the embargo stay? it's made life really hard for every day cubans. the sooner it goes, the better 




 no, it's science 




 cuba's economy is only the way it is BECAUSE of the US embargo. once castro dies, the boom in tourism is going to go thru the roof.  




 why do you hate your parents? did they do or not do something? and committing suicide isnt the answer, and writing a fake note isnt either. neither of these are a solution. what did you want to accomplish? did you want them to change their minds about something? maybe we can brainstorm together to find a different way to get to that point. 




 oh the irony.... 




 something , something, church and state 




 except that on reddit, we all have to abide by the rules that the admins set, and one of those rules is that nobody under 13 is allowed on. 




 whoopsies, that'll learn me to check my clipboard. i'm building a site for my friend

here ya go!

http://www.reddit.com/r/TransSpace/comments/36xmrj/wait_times_for_sexual_reassignment_surgery/

(thanks for looking out!) 




 we're actually working on providing links to published studies, as well as links to general information from the various medical organizations.

of course it always helps when people flag a comment that's questionable or that goes against established guidelines. we're human, and sometimes we miss things 




 trans girl/trans guy 




 they've given up in the gay marriage, that's why you see all these "religious freedom" laws popping up. segregationists did the same thing during the civil rights era. 




 soooo... a war against rhetoric? 

 nbsp;

^^i'll nbsp;see nbsp;myself nbsp;out nbsp;now 




 that would require an original idea 




 The distinction between sex and gender differentiates sex (anatomy of an individual's reproductive system, and secondary sex characteristics) from gender (social roles based on the sex of the person, usually culturally learned), or personal identification of one's own gender based on an internal awareness (gender identity). Gender is sometimes referred to as the sex of the brain. In some circumstances, an individual's assigned sex and gender do not align, and the result is sometimes a transgender person. 




 rules are rules, and as a mod you decide how they are applied. i abide by those rules.  




 dont let the door hit ya, where the good lord split ya 




 so let it be written, so let it be done 




 they now have hormone implants, so we can go 6 months or a year before needing it replaced. 




 um, no, again, i posted it because 1) i'm trans, 2) i was in the military. this article shows me that the attitudes are changing, ever so slowly, but changing all the same.

and believe me, if i posted to srs every time i ran into a homophobe or a transphobe, that's all i'd be doing on reddit. i DO however want to try and change attitudes myself.

i cant change the fact that i'm trans. i CAN try and change perceptions of trans people so that maybe someday, we can serve openly.
 




 i'd agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong.

;-) 




 it's the military, the rules dont always makes sense 




 becuz rules.

(and try not to use the T word, would ya? it's considered a slur) 




 i see, because i mod queer news sites and have to populate those queer news sites with articles, it's considered "spam"? i also post to /r/atheism and /r/science, but i guess those would be "articles of interest" right? 

this article was relevant to me as a trans woman and as someone who served her country (full disclosure - not US Military). if you want i could get my jarhead friends to repost this.

there are transgender vets from all branches of the service, that's a fact. and there will CONTINUE to be trans people who serve, as a mod of a few transgender subs, i know this to be true because i know several people who are currently on active service.

i posted it here because it was apropos for both me and the sub. why dont you try reading the article first before you judge.  




 i try not to post buzzfeed links, but this was a pretty good one as far as their stories go. 




 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand this is why i post stories like this here. simply because transphobic people like you are still around. lots of us trans girls served because we saw the military as a last chance to "man up". doesnt make our service any less meaningful than yours. when we're done, we transition. and some of us need help with that from the VA. thankfully, the VA isnt as transphobic as you. 

 




 you're welcome! 




 wait, hold up, you think a story about transgender vets getting the help they need from the VA is clickbaity? 




 nah, my bible thumping fam fam had WAY more issues over me being transgender and a lesbian than me being an atheist, 




 come on ireland, you can do this! 




 c'mon ireland, you can do this!!!

woooooo! 




 gender and sex are very different. sex is who you go to bed with, gender is who you go to bed as. 




 ok, there's a lot going on here, so let's break it down, it'll be easier to handle in chunks. taken altogether, it's overwhelming.

ok, first thing you have to know is that you can transition on the DL, you'll just need a sports bra when the boobs start coming in. either that, or maybe it's time to find some on campus accommodation.

if you have your health insurance thru your school,  trying sending your hormones to a PO Box, they're relatively easy to get, or send it to a friend you trust. (i'm going to assume your parents will snoop)

now, uni. if it's not too late, drop the classes you're behind in, i'm assuming your grades are crappy. it's ok, classes can be retaken. no biggie, it'll be ok.

most of all, take a little time out and have a deep breath, you dont have to do everything at once. it's not hopeless when you break it down into itty bitty little steps. 

like /u/Yveris, when i had my breakdown, it wasnt pretty. i holed up in my apartment for two months during my awkward, inbetweeny stage. i popped a lot of Xanax because i was having panic attacks ALL the time. almost lost my job, almost got kicked out of my apartment. urgh, those were NOT fun times.

but i CAN tell you is that when i got thru that, it started getting easier, i stopped getting the stares and everybody just started gendering me female.

you can do this too. you gotta just look to what your next step is, just work to cross that thing off your list. you gotta do it one step at a time.

you can do this.

 




 it'll be fine, just remember, it only sucks for awhile 




 3 3 




 stop by /r/asktransgender if you're feeling down, or if you want to check in, or need a pick-me-up, we're always there to help

also, good luck! 




 or a chris hansen special 




 but it always helps to have backup ;-)

thanks!

Position Statement on Access to Care for Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals (2012)  
 The American Psychiatric Association:  
1. Recognizes that appropriately evaluated transgender and gender variant individuals can benefit greatly from medical and surgical gender transition treatments.  
2. Advocates for removal of barriers to care and supports both public and private health insurance coverage for gender transition treatment.  
3. Opposes categorical exclusions of coverage for such medically necessary treatment when prescribed by a physician.

Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals
(2012)  
 Being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities; however, these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression Thus, this position statement is relevant to the APA because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of  transgender and gender variant individuals.  

**The American Psychiatric Association:**  
1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals.  
2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals.  
3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care, employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and licensing.  
4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these individuals greater than that imposed on any other persons.

Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity   Gender Expression Non-Discrimination (2008)
As stated in the Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity   Gender Expression NonDiscrimination,
the APA opposes all public and private discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived gender identity and expression and urges the repeal of discriminatory laws and policies and calls upon psychologists in their professional roles to provide appropriate, nondiscriminatory treatment to transgender and gender variant individuals and encourages psychologists to take a leadership role in working against discrimination towards transgender and gender variant individuals. 

The APA recognizes the efficacy, benefit and medical necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals and calls upon public and private insurers to cover these medically necessary treatments.

Resolution No. 1004 (2012)
In 2007, an AAFP Commission declared that the association has a policy opposing any
form of patient discrimination and stated its opposition to the exclusion of transgender
health care. In 2012, the organization released a new resolution: RESOLVED, That the
American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) support efforts to require insurers to
provide coverage for comprehensive care of [transgender] individuals including medical
care, screening tests based on medical need rather than gender, mental health care, and,
when medically necessary, gender reassignment surgery.

[S]ex reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures...


The medical procedures attendant to sex reassignment are not cosmetic or elective or for the mere convenience of the patient. These reconstructive procedures are not optional in any meaningful sense, but are understood to be medically necessary for the treatment of the diagnosed condition.

**National Commission on Correctional Health Care**


Position Statement: Transgender Health Care in Correctional Settings (2009) 

The health risks of overlooking the particular needs of transgender inmates are so severe that acknowledgment of the problem and policies that assure appropriate and responsible provision of health care are needed.  
Because prisons, jails, and juvenile justice facilities have a responsibility to ensure the physical and mental health and well-being of transgender people in their custody, correctional health staff should manage these inmates in a manner that respects the
biomedical and psychological aspects of a gender identity disorder (GID) diagnosis.

**American Medical Association**  
Resolution: Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients (2008)  
An established body of medical research demonstrates the effectiveness and medical necessity of mental health care, hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery as forms of therapeutic treatment for many people diagnosed with GID Therefore, be it
RESOLVED, that the AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for  treatment of gender identity disorder.

**American Psychiatric Association**  
Position Statement on Access to Care for Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals (2012)  
 The American Psychiatric Association:  
1. Recognizes that appropriately evaluated transgender and gender variant individuals can benefit greatly from medical and surgical gender transition treatments.  
2. Advocates for removal of barriers to care and supports both public and private health insurance coverage for gender transition treatment.  
3. Opposes categorical exclusions of coverage for such medically necessary treatment when prescribed by a physician.

Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals
(2012)  
 Being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities; however, these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression Thus, this position statement is relevant to the APA because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of  transgender and gender variant individuals.  

**The American Psychiatric Association:**  
1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals.  
2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals.  
3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care, employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and licensing.  
4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these individuals greater than that imposed on any other persons.

 awwwww, thanks! 




 you identify with your gender before puberty 




 http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/11/11/hey-yall-southern-accents-voted-most-attractive/ 




 i'm always on /r/asktransgender if you want to ask questions! or send me a PM 




 yeesh, to tell each of the people in my inner circle, i had to practically chug an entire bottle of wine before i could send them an IM. (i was too chicken to tell them face to face. and right after i told everybody, i was even MORE terrified because there was no going back at that point. i had the whole "WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST DO?" moment.

and the first 6 months of transition was rough, i HATED the inbetweeny stage. urgh. when people dont quite know what gender you are and they just STARE, or whisper. god i hated the whispers.

now i'm having a blast. altho i kick myself for not coming out sooner.

Fear is a bitch. 




 sometimes we just know. i knew at 7, but spent the next 33 years in denial. 




 She, please use the proper pronouns, it's only common courtesy. you wouldnt like it if somebody kept misgendering you, so please stop doing it. it's insulting.

and yes, if a child identifies as transgender, they are taken to a therapist and if a diagnosis of gender dysphoria is given then depending on how far along puberty they are on the Tanner scale, puberty blockers or hormones are prescribed. this is true for bot transgender girls and boys.  




  Is it really possible for a prepubescent girl to be trans?

yes

and stop mixing up sexuality and gender, those are distinct from one another.

[Children as young as two can struggle with gender identity](http://www.wdbj7.com/news/local/early-years-children-as-young-as-two-can-struggle-with-gender-identity/33124652)

Wouldn't it be easy for a child to fake being trans just to be a part of a club? 

ok, think about what you just asked. you're asking a child, who at that point in their life just wants to fit and with all their friends, to do something that would make them COMPLETELY different from all their friends.

besides, there are criteria that doctors and therapists use before they give a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. 




 aint THAT the truth. i pushed it for as long as i could, because i was SO scared of transitioning. you know, the usual questions, "what if i dont pass?" "will anyone find me attractive?" "what will my friends/family say?" etc etc ad nauseum, ad infinitum.

i just ran out of energy to fight it anymore. 

i'm WAY happier now! 




 transgender females are females, they arent boys. and gender has nothing to do with sexual development. your gender identiy kicks in at a very early age.  




 girl, trans girl. the girl scouts only accept girls. 




 hey you started transition way before me, i only started at 39 




 i think those are really good questions. i hope somebody does a follow up study with those in mind 




 actually, according to the DSM V, it's no longer a disorder. being transgender now falls under "gender dysphoria" 




 urgh, gross. so much for "family values" 




 they're true, his dad was the one who turned him in, the only reason he didnt get charged was that the detective in charge was a pedophile too and was hoarding all the evidence he had collected for himself. the cop was removed from the case, tried, and convicted, but by the time they got around to trying to carge duggar, the statue of limitations had expired.

TL;DR: he's guilty, but didnt get charged because of a technicality 




 the latter 




 you're allowed to specify, so in this case, TEXAS House

*edit: dang it, they changed the headline, so you're right 




 nope 




 Ok, which of you raptors has been sending sexy pics to the straight friend that you're desperately in love with? C'mon, 'fess up! 




 [we destroy objective reality](http://www.politicususa.com/2015/05/17/mat-staver-transgender-rights-destroy-objective-reality-2.html) 




 well, i'm trans, and i knew what the pastors were telling me about sex and gender didnt quiiiiiiiiite line up with reality, at least in the way i was experiencing it. so that's when it started, i figured, if they were wrong about that, i wondered what ELSE were they wrong about. and the things that happen in the bible and the contradictions and the stuff you had to take on faith.... it was a slippery slope right toward atheism. 




 [like this?](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/18/us-health-sexual-males-idUSKBN0O31M220150518)

 they're the ones that eat the babies, right? or do they do the earthquakes? it changes so often that i cant keep track even with the cabal meeting notes 




 hey, at least you admitted your mistake. i went to summer bible camp for ten years, i was a true believer.... right up until i started going to those camps. the more i read the bible, the less sense it made. 




 yeeeeeeeeeeeeeup 




 isnt it? 




 it always amazes me to find out people ACTUALLY believe this shit 




 lol 




 oh yes, at this point, it's a complete hodge podge. it's amazing that anyone can understand me at all 




 dont forget "class", that one's a dead give away, because the brit in me slips out. every time i say it people give me a weird look. 




 just out of curiosity, what were the other more ludicrous titles there? 




 just a little bit to their left.... 




 Oh, dogs. Sure, I like dags. I like caravans more.

 yeesh, the fear of not passing, that's a really common fear among trans people, guys and girls alike. the height isnt a big deal, just go onto /r/tall and you'll see plenty of cis girls way taller than you. hell, you'd be one of the shorties.

and as for your shoulders? [here's jesslyn](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=e7d_1298068190)

never doubt the power of hormones, makeup, and the right clothes.

i was terrified of not being able to pass as female. my therapist suggested very firmly that i start seeing her in girlmode, and for the first few times, i hid behind a hat and sunglasses, and i practically RAN to her office. she had a helpful piece of advice, she called what i was experiencing Other People's Disease. and she was right, i was transitioning because i was trans, not to pass some arbitrary standard of some nebulous concept in my head of what an ideal female was supposed to look like. once you start owning who you are, it gets easier to deal. "passing" for what it is worth, comes a lot of the time just from confidence and a little slight of hand. like i said, hormones, makeup, and the right clothes.

so, if you decide to join us on the journey to planet girl, feel free to send me a PM if you wanna talk, or post another question here, there'll always be someone here to help

 The typical American woman will have two children in her lifetime. That means she will spend more than three decades trying to avoid pregnancy.

The most effective contraceptives are IUDs and implants. These methods are up to 20 times more effective than the birth control pill in preventing pregnancy, and they are often the safest options for women.

But high up-front costs put these methods out of reach for a lot of women. Insurance coverage for contraception without a co-pay would allow a woman to choose the best method for her, not just what fits in her budget. Taking away coverage would effectively block access to those most-effective methods.

Birth control is not only safe and effective preventive care, it is also care that physicians support and millions of women need. Allowing an employer's personal values to trump his or her employees' right to care would allow the beliefs of the few to trump the health of many. That's both bad policy and bad medicine. 




 i have no problem with your faith, right up to the point where the followers and leaders of said faith try to impose the beliefs of the faith onto me.  




 just wanted to point out how ludicrous it was 




 **Women like their birth control:**

* 99% of women who have had sex have used contraceptives at some point. Its already a near-universal practice.

* Opponents of contraceptive coverage are in the minority. In a recent NPRThompson Reuters poll, 77% of respondents said that private insurance plans should cover some or all of the cost of birth control pills. If the plan is subsidized by the government, 74% of respondents thought it should cover some or all of the cost.

* Women who have used birth control pills have been found to have fewer cases of anemia (low red blood cells), ovarian cancer, and uterine cancer. These beneficial effects occur because the birth control pill works by decreasing the number of ovulations, amount of menstrual blood flow, and frequency of periods.

* Taking the Pill helps prevent or reduce the occurrence of functional cysts (the most common kind of ovarian cyst), which form when ovulation goes awry.

* Oral contraceptives are also used to treat cystic acne, a potentially scarring condition that affects women even into their forties.

**Why we need birth control:**

* Half of pregnancies among American women are unplanned. Of unplanned pregnancies, 4 in 10 end in abortion. Preventing unplanned pregnancy prevents abortions.

* Contraception is estimated to save $19 billion a year in costs related to unplanned pregnancies. Increasing access will increase savings.

* Contraception supports and improves women and childrens health outcomes by enabling women to plan the spacing and timing of their pregnancies. It is also used to address health issues such as preventing ovarian cysts or endometrial and ovarian cancers.

* Access to free birth control leads to lower rates of abortions and teen births, according to a new and extensive study from Washington University in St. Louis.

* The average cost per publicly financed unintended pregnancy is nearly $10,000.

* New York Citys teen pregnancy rate has decreased by 27% over the past decade. And Health Commissioner Tom Farley attributes the change, in part, to the provision of contraceptives in public schools. 




  Corinthians Chapter 7

i see, so if we apply that, then we have to abolish divorce too, right?

10 To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. 11 But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.

and we can bring back slavery, right?

21 Were you a slave when you were called? Dont let it trouble you

or are we cherry picking? because if we're cherry picking, they i freely choose to ignore everything in the bible that i disagree with. 




 you raise some good points 




 riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight. you keep telling yourself that 




 so in other words, even tho the bible is filled with "thou shall not" verses, which are rather specific in their meaning, you cannot show a single verse that specifically states that one should not practice contraception. got it. 




 i'm asking again where in the bible it specifically states that practicing contraception goes against the word of god. also, while we're at it, since you brought it up, please show me where in the bible it specifically says to practice celibacy until marriage.  




 the current genration isnt as hung up about gender and sexuality. it is a far more accepting world, from women's colleges accepting transgender females, to more positive roles on screen and in print. even the tabloids are toning it down as can be shown in the coverage of bruce jenner's transition. there are federal, state, and city protections for trans and gay people.

homophobic and transphobic religious outlooks like yours are ever more the minority. and the world is a better place for it.  




 can you please show me where contraception goes against the word of god?  i must have missed the part where jesus said, "thou shall not hath thou pill!" 




 right right, adam's apple the size of a fist, man hands, and anynumber of insults you use to hurl at trans women, like i said, transphobia. there are none so blind. 

using your hypothetical situation of a trans woman at a bar. if you're chatting up a girl and you find out she's trans and you're uncomfortable with the thought of sleeping with her, even though you were attacted to her before, here's what you say,

"i'm sorry, i'm not comfortable with it. sorry for giving the wrong impression. i'm flattered that you would find me attractive enough to ask."

protip: also works for gay people hitting on you

protip 2: always observe the golden rule, i.e., dont be a dick 




 please see "lack of evidence." should eveidence arise that shows proof of god or life after death, i will happily change my outlook. 




 i tried looking for it, but i couldnt find it, i'd love to read what you thought 




 i know, but we always get so excited by the rise of the "nones" 




 fear of death is no reason to sacrifice logic for comfort. we do know that when we die, we cease to exist on this plane of existence. if there is another plane we go to, nobody has yet found it. to say that we go on in some form without any evidence does us a disservice.

that's the whole basis of the "god of the gaps" theory, where where anything and everything that science doesnt have an answer for must be proof of "god" 




 i'll take banana for $500 for the next question, alex 




 yes, people like you like to think that trans women go around and hang out in bars for the sole purpose of "tricking" men into sleeping with them. 

trans women are women, and there are plenty of men who think so. they just have to weed out the bigots like you. 

 




 as a trans girl, i too, love my HRT 




 Transphobia (or much less commonly transprejudice) is a range of antagonistic attitudes and feelings against transsexuality and transsexual or transgender people, based on the expression of their internal gender identity (see Phobia  Terms for prejudice). 




 ahhhh, i was wondering when the homo and trans phobia would show. took you long enough. always about the sex. you do realize that relationship are more than just sex right? and again, what people do behind closed doors is up to them. people like you always reduce it to sex, or the ick factor. well,  get over it. the world has changed, and we're all better for it. 

 




 none, zlich, nil 




 again, only religious fanatics cling to outdated ideas, as the rest of the world advances past them. 




 By the end of the 19th century, medicine and psychiatry were effectively competing with religion and the law for jurisdiction over sexuality. Thankfully, science won out. Early in the twentieth century, Havelock Ellis argued that homosexuality was inborn and therefore not immoral, that it was not a disease, and that many homosexuals made outstanding contributions to society.

Yes, they were wrong about a lot of things back then, and as science and medicine advance, our knowledge expands, and treatments, diagnoses, and definitions change. Religion, on the other hand, does not.

I live in a world of reason and logic. and there is no scientific basis for the need, or for that matter, the ability, to change a person's sexuality. 




 yeeeeeeup 




 Freud believed that a homosexual orientation should not be viewed as a form of pathology.

"Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function produced by a certain arrest of sexual development. Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals, several of the greatest men among them (Plato, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, etc.). It is a great injustice to persecute homosexuality as a crime, and cruelty too...."

Homosexuality was removed from the DSM because it was never an illness in the first place. 




 no, the DSM was changed in regards to homosexuality because of evidence that showed that it was not a disease. There is a debate in the medical and transgender communities about whether or not Gender Dysphoria should remain in the DSM. But only because some believe removing it could limit patients access to insurance coverage.
 




 while not all Singaporeans are homophobic or transphobic, there were enough of them to make me leave and not come back, and this was 20 years ago. honestly, i dont see myself going back at all.  




  Your confusing religious fundamentalism with life, reality, biology, history and, well, just about everything.

i'm not the religious fundamentalist here. and luckily, neither are any of the medical organizations. see, they make their protocols based on evidence and not what's written down in "holy" texts 




 Religious fundamentalism has been found to correlate positively with anti-homosexual bias. One way you can tell that people are starting from a conclusion and arguing backwards is when they bust out the everything-and-the-kitchen-sink strategy: Trying a bunch of different arguments in hopes that one sticks.

 




 people arent in pain with their sexuality or gender, they're in pain because people like you want to CHANGE their sexuality or gender. religion has it's place, you are free to believe whatever the hell you want. you cannot, however, impose those beliefs and values on others. 




 there are none so blind as those who cannot see.

dude, drop it already. if you cant see that your position goes against the collective procedures of every single medical organization on this planet, then i cant help you.

the only people still advocating for conversion therapy are religious organizations. 

seriously, let it go, you'll be a happier person. 




 no, every tans person is unique, and they experience dysphoria in different ways. and they may or may not get different kinds of surgeries. or none, if the case may be 




 racist much?

fingerprints are a unique identifier that a different from person to person, i.e. unlike race or gender

psychological trauma again implying that some trauma leads people to be gay or trans, which goes against all current establish medical evidence to the contrary 

absent parents, again imply trauma leads people to be gay or trans, which goes against all current establish medical evidence to the contrary  




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards_of_Care_for_the_Health_of_Transsexual,_Transgender,_and_Gender_Nonconforming_People

but you go right ahead and keep calling the WPATH a "political" organization. in the meanwhile, here's more:- 

The American Psychological Association is the largest scientific and professional organization representing psychology in the United States, with more than 122,500 researchers, educators, clinicians, consultants and students as its members.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence can be given the diagnosis of "gender dysphoria."

A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder.

 Researchers adept at analyzing the genetic threads of human diversity say that the concept of race--the source of abiding cultural and political divisions in American society--simply has no basis in fundamental human biology.

With the tools of molecular biology, scientists can peer past superficial characteristics to explore more powerful, underlying genetic commonalities and differences, which are making racial categories look increasingly arbitrary and irrelevant, the experts said.

"Biologically, we are saying in essence that race is no longer a valid scientific distinction," said Solomon H. Katz, a University of Pennsylvania anthropologist.

"Race is a social construct derived mainly from perceptions conditioned by events of recorded history, and it has no basic biological reality," said C. Loring Brace, a biological anthropologist at the University of Michigan.

"The old biological definitions of race were based on what people looked like," said Joseph L. Graves Jr., an evolutionary biologist at Arizona State University West. "Now that we have better ways of looking at race . . . we could construct races based on what type of fingerprints people have, or on what kind of blood type they have, and that would be just as legitimate." 




 There is no single explanation for why some people are transgender. The diversity of transgender expression and experiences argues against any simple or unitary explanation. Many experts believe that biological factors such as genetic influences and prenatal hormone levels, early experiences, and experiences later in adolescence or adulthood may all contribute to the development of transgender identities.

A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder. For these individuals, the significant problem is finding affordable resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress, including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect experiences with discrimination, or assault. These experiences may lead many transgender people to suffer with anxiety, depression or related disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence can be given the diagnosis of "gender dysphoria." Some contend that the diagnosis inappropriately pathologizes gender noncongruence and should be eliminated. Others argue that it is essential to retain the diagnosis to ensure access to care. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is under revision and there may be changes to its current classification of intense persistent gender incongruence as "gender identity disorder."

 




 it's for minors 




 the bill is for the protection of minors, so that parents cant force their kids to those pray-away-the-gay camps. as an adult, if you want to fool yourself into thinking that you can change your sexuality, go right ahead. 




  There ARE documented cases of success with conversion therapy.

no, no there arent. nada. zip. zero.

The most important fact about these therapies is that they are based on a view of homosexuality that has been rejected by all the major mental health professions. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, six published by the American Psychiatric Association, which defines the standards of the field, does not include homosexuality. All other major health professional organizations have supported the American Psychiatric Association in its declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder in 1973. Thus, the idea that homosexuality is a mental disorder or that the emergence of same-sex attraction and orientation among some adolescents is in any way abnormal or mentally unhealthy has no support among any mainstream health and mental health professional organizations. 




 they've tried changing the mind to fit the body, and it never worked.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer 




 you can wander to your heart's content, it's just when it comes to the actual "light up" that you have to leave. like i sed, tis a silly place. 




 as a tourist? prolly fine. and there are gay clubs there if you're into that sort of thing. it's just as a citizen, gay people often have the short end of the sticl 




 The WPATH Standards of Care for Gender Identity Disorders were first issued in 1979, and articulate the "professional consensus about the psychiatric, psychological, medical and surgical management of GID." Periodically revised to reflect the latest clinical practice and scientific research, the Standards also unequivocally reflect the Association's conclusion that treatment is medically necessary.

Sex (gender) reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures. Genital reconstruction is not required for social gender recognition, and such surgery should not be a prerequisite for document or record changes; the Real Life Experience component of the transition process is crucial to psychological adjustment, and is usually completed prior to any genital reconstruction, when appropriate for the patient, according to the WPATH Standards of Care. Changes to documentation are important aids to social functioning, and are a necessary component of the pre-surgical process; delay of document changes may have a deleterious impact on a patient's social integration and personal safety.

 

Medically necessary sex reassignment procedures also include complete hysterectomy, bilateral mastectomy, chest reconstruction or augmentation as appropriate to each patient (including breast prostheses if necessary), genital reconstruction (by various techniques which must be appropriate to each patient, including, for example, skin flap hair removal, penile and testicular prostheses, as necessary), facial hair removal, and certain facial plastic reconstruction as appropriate to the patient.

"Non-genital surgical procedures are routinely performed... notably, subcutaneous mastectomy in female-to-male transsexuals, and facial feminization surgery, and/or breast augmentation in male-to-female transsexuals. These surgical interventions are often of greater practical significance in the patient's daily life than reconstruction of the genitals." 


Furthermore, not every patient will have a medical need for identical procedures; clinically appropriate treatments must be determined on an individualized basis with the patient's physician. 




 because they tried changing the mind to fit the body and it doesnt work. that's why the recommended course of treatment for transgender individuals is to transition. 




 yes, make fun of it. like the racists who made fun of desegregationists. because that's the company you're keeping right now. 




 lol, you'll do just fine, come on over to the sub, plenty of interesting convos going on 




 yes, i noticed

:-p 




 non-op, i got all the parts i was born with, altho, i did promise my bestie that if i ever had my testicles removed, he could hang em from his rearview mirror like fuzzy dice. 




 thanks! 




 hmm, i use a 16g to draw, but even with an 18g it shouldnt be that hard to draw. and you're doing everything right. do you know anybody else that can show you how to draw? can you go back to the clinic and get a nurse to show you how to draw? 




 YAY!! congrats on getting on hrt. glad the sub has helped.  




 well come over to /r/genderqueer, plenty of non binaries for you talk to. 




 i stand corrected 




 lol, all the other gay and lesbian couples and groups that i know are perfectly happy with each other. i'm pretty good with my two girlfriends. and we get on great with other straight people who arent all tied up into knots trying to reconcile their faith with the new reality.

opinions like yours are fast fading into memory. and while they'll prolly always be around, just like racism is still with us, they will be reviled for the homophobic and transphobic thought that they are.

there are more people today who fight for equality than there are people like you tryin g to sow hate and fear and division. that's why we're winning and that's why we will continue to win. inclusion helps everybody feel a part from society, exclusionary ideas that you push, just isolate you more and more. 




 i had enough problems switching from boy to girl, i am NOT going back 




 huh? conversion therapy is an attempt to force the conversion of someone's sexuality, in the case of minors, usually against their will.  




 yeah, you and me both 




 you seem unusually concerned by what two people do behind closed doors and by what gender they are. is there anything you'd like to to talk about? feel free. like i sed, no judgements here 




 this bill is specifically for minors. if you're an adult, you can do whatever you want 




 because all the the major medical institutions have labeled conversion therapy as ineffective and harmful. you are free to believe whatever you want, you are not free to forcefully impose those beliefs by sending your child away to reeducation camps. 




 actually, it doesnt at all, wanna know why? because loving another person is a wonderful experience. we only limit ourselves by adhering to the rigid sex and gender binaries. sex, like gender is a broad spectrum. we are made lesser by not exploring other options. just as travel broadens the mind, exploring our gender and sexuality broadens it too.  
























 yes? your point being? 




 merely asking for proof of god, nothing more. should be simple enough, no? 




 no, i have seen no proof of god, until such proof exists, there is no god. pretty simple. science is all based on proof. show me proof and i will believe. until then. there is no god. 




 and there's the actual bible that treats women like property. 




 http://imgur.com/DStRYfh 




 yes, and comics are proof that  mutants exist.  




 oh we dont, we're still waiting for people to prove that god exists. so far, nothing. 




 please see - ALL the Crusades

also see - World War II re: Germans and Jews

aaaaaaaaaaaaaand we're done  




 an entire body of medical professionals would disagree with you about both sexuality and gender. and given a choice between the two, i'll go with medicine. religion isnt logical in the slightest. the belief in people coming back from the dead, or walking on water would require too much of a suspension of common sense. the bible isnt meant to be literal, there are too many contradictions. and unless you're reading it in its original aramaic and greek, you're not really getting the true context 




 do you really want me to start listing out all the so called christians who have been caught doing something unchristian? i mean there's an entire 2000 year  history of JUST the catholic church. 




 you know what, if more people had your attitude, i'd be a really happy trans girl 




 misguided, maybe, but not inherently bad 




 it'll open in an incognito window 




 amen 




 you should see my inbox. yeeesh. it's always the fundies. YOU WILL BURN IN HELL FOR ALL ETERNITY, but i will pray for your eternal soul.

uhhhh.... ok, thanks? 




 i have, that's how i became an atheist 




 only pointing out the hypocrites who preach family values who are then caught doing something they shouldnt be doing, like all the priests diddling little alter boys beneath their robes. 

were there atheist pedophiles? i'm sure there were, but they didnt have organized religion to hide behind so that they could continue doing it. 




 the bible is a fairy tale, and the sooner more people see that, the better off we will all be. people created god in their own image, and people can kill him too.

you will not accept homosexuality because of the bible? a book that says the sun is fixed in the sky? and that the moon is a light source? 

i used to think the way you did, i grew up christian, and then i studied the bible and i saw the error of my ways and became an atheist.

When I was a child, I spoke and thought and reasoned as a child. But when I grew up, I put away childish things. - 1 Corinthians 13:11 




 religion = choice

my sexuality and/or gender = not choice

when you use religion to criticize my sexuality and/or gender, then you are choosing to do so. because you could just as easily choose not to. therefore, you are in the wrong. pretty dang simple. 




 you didnt just compare homosexuality to pedophilia and torturing people at the stake, did you? christianity is a lifestyle choice, my sexuality and gender arent. my life isnt a "theory", i live it every day. and i take offense to anyone who criticizes it because of something somebody passed down thru oral tradition from the Bronze Age. society has evolved way past the need for religion. the faster it dies, the better off all of us will be.  




 i'd love to see a few examples of atheist "family values" hypocrisy if you could post a few articles. i'd do the same with the hypocritical christians, but even if i limited myself to the scandals that came out this year, i'd run out of space pretty quick. 




 well, first off, i have to point out that if anyone is against homosexuality/ non male/female marriages, then they are a bigot, even if they couch their arguments with the cloak of religion. religion is a choice, my sexuality isnt. so people can choose NOT to be a bigot, because there are plenty of christians who accept homosexuality for what it is, part of every day life. 




 http://imgur.com/DStRYfh 




 look at how many supposedly "good christian" people who preach their "good christian" values end up getting caught for doing something inappropriate which go against said "good christian" values.

and again, the only thing atheists argue for is that there arent any gods. that's pretty much it. everything else about how to live your life is completely up to you, good OR bad. 




 but atheists dont go around preaching family values explicitly laid down for them in a holy book. 




 it's pulled directly from the summary. 




 the title is pulled directly from the summary 




 jeez, it's like you become a pariah. i told a cousin that when i came out, i picked as an example of the kind of girl i wanted to be look wise (we have the same body type) and the first thing she says to me is "Look, i'm a REAL girl, ok? 100% female"

urgh.

i have to add that she's since become one of my biggest allies, because the REST of the fam fam hasnt come around yet. 




 actually, it was pulled from the summary 




 yes, and which is why we say that you can discuss YOUR OWN DOSE as well as to state that we ARENT doctors.

every single one of us knows somebody who self-meds. some do because they didnt want to spend one more day as a gender they werent. some of us just had no access to a doctor who would prescribe them hormones. 

we are NOT against self-medding. we just ask that people not give out advice as if there were only one dose for everybody. there isnt. i'm not on spiro, or progesterone, only estrogen shots. one of my girlfriends is on shots too, but she takes them every week as opposed to every two weeks like me. my other partner is on spiro, estrogen, and progesterone, and she might add avodart to her regimen.

the mods of /r/asktransgender care about the community, which is why we became mods in the first place.   




 yeah, they WERE rewritten as of Jan this year. i totes WAS going off the old rules. still stands tho. we're not doctors. we cant be going around giving out medical advice. we CAN discuss what OUR dosages are, and point out that there isnt a "standard" dose for everybody.

 




 no one standard dose, i should have said. i stand corrected. i was just trying to make the point that you cant just go around telling people that they should just take a certain dose of certain types of pills  




 i'm 42, came out when i was 39, and yes, i feel like i'm still in my teens/20's. totes should have come out earlier. but i cant go back and change the past, i dunno if i would, i like the way my life turned out, i've had a blast and i continue to have fun.

i guess it's all in how you perceive it.  




 i'm not a doctor, there is no such thing as a "standard dose" which part about those two things dont make sense? not everyone reacts to hormones in the same way, which is why we should ALWAYS see a doctor first.

yes, not all of us have access to a doctor. which is why we allow discussions about dosing AS LONG AS WE DONT SUGGEST THAT IT IS WHAT EVERYONE SHOULD DO.

i have two other trans girls living with me, and we are ALL on different prescriptions. it is the height of arrogance to assume that you know what the other person's correct dosage should be.



 




 and we choose to abide by those rules. we arent doctors. and even if we were, the people asking for advice to DIY arent our patients. and even if they were, we STILL couldnt prescribe them meds because we'd have to do a full check up first.

yes, there are those of us who DIY, but it should be the absolute last resort.

i'm sorry you seem to disagree, but we have a responsibility as mods to the trans community and to the reddit community as a whole to abide by the rules the admins have set down. 




 we've tried to keep everybody informed with the changes we've made AND we've asked for suggestions. so to say we've got "secret rules" is simply not true.

 open it in incognito 




 i know, i pulled the title straight from the summary 




 fair enough 




 so explain why there are so many other posts about it then. you gonna remove all of them? or just mine? 




 wait, the attorney general of Delaware and the son of the vice president dies and it's not explicitly related to politics? i call shenanigans

 the footy is something else entirely, because i think that any club other than liverpool is sub-standard, but i do enjoy the rangers celtic matches to no end. 




 i know you feel alone, when i came out, i thought i'd have to do this all by my lonesome, and my friends not only supported me, but they wanted to come along for the ride. i have never cried as much as i did the day i came out to my friends and one by one they almost all gave me their unconditional support. by the time i was done telling all my friends, i was a blubbering pile of jello.

you're not alone, you never will be.

your answer means that you'd be happier as a girl, which means the answer to your question of whether or not to transition is "YES"

if you are trans, then the only option for us IS to transition. who can only find true happiness if we are in turn true to ourselves. living a lie will never achieve that. 




 i grew up methodist, spent ten summers at bible camp, i know religious stupid. my dad doesnt believe that trans is a thing. out of my entire family, i have two cousins who support me.... and that's it. if you have a religious fam fam like i did, you are shit of out luck. my dad tells me all the time that he'll pray for me. 

my friends are my family now, although i'm not giving up hope that my fam fam will come around.

but you transition or not because you're trans, or not. not because of anyone else but you. 

if you had that magic button to press, and you could wake up tomorrow in the other gender and no one would be the wiser, would you do it or not? therein lies your answer. 




 hang on, dont chew my head off, i was merely trying to lighten the mood. but honestly, it really is a decision only you can make. nobody here lives in your head or knows the situation better than you do, so it really does have to be up to you.

if you already are seeing a therapist, that's great, please continue to do so and i hope they they can help you ultimately make the decision.  




 lol, you looking for permission?? with the power bestowed upon me by the poodles before me, i hereby grant thee permission to transition!

ta daaaaaaaaaaaa!

but seriously, have you had a talk with a gender therapist? because that's something only you can really answer for yourself.

as far as how you look... you're preeeeeeeeetty andro right now, 




 there's no one way to be genderfluid, if you sub to /r/genderqueer (i mod over there too), you'll find lots of people who experience gender in MANY different ways and who present in many more variants than you think possible.

i know plenty of people who shift abruptly, somtimes from one extreme to another, i.e. super femme to super butch.

i cant speak to your other issues, but your gender issues are NOT out of the ordinary.

come over and chat, post the same question you did here, you'll find plenty of people replying 




 lucky for me that i went to college, so i know better than what they teach in high school 




 like i said, i'd agree with your opinion, but then we would both be wrong 




 well, i'd agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong 




 except that it was supposed to be an "adrenaline shot to the arm"  




 you're welcome! altho i'm more of an F1 kinda girl.

 ok! sorry about the raw story post, i totally missed that error. 




 well, i could post from another source, but there's already been a pretty good discussion.  should i post it so people can continue talking about it, or no?

 yes, which is why it is flaired with the "Social Science" tag 




 every religious figure you can mention was a flawed human being.

Martin Luther  King was a serial adulterer, the FBIs monitoring of King  make up much of what we now know about the mans personal life. King had engaged in so many extramarital affairs that his wife, Coretta Scott King, had reportedly become disillusioned with their marriage.

Kings right-hand man, Ralph Abernathy, wrote in his 1989 autobiography that the staff all understood and believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside marriage. It was just that he had a particularly difficult time with that temptation.

Billy Graham? Homophobic bigot. He considered homosexual behavior to be a "sinister form of perversion," a lifestyle choice that will lead gays to personal ruin. When a young woman wrote him about her sexual love for another woman in 1974, the evangelist replied with a threat: homosexual perverts will not inherit the kingdom of heaven. "Your affection for another of your own sex is misdirected and will be judged by God's holy standards," he answered.

Mahatma Gandhi? He had unusual personal practices (which included, alongside his famed chastity, sleeping naked next to nubile, naked women to test his restraint.) The pre-independence prime minister of the Indian state of Travancore called him, "a most dangerous, semi-repressed sex maniac"

 




 more like BANG! "i was forced to shoot him because he was wielding something in his hand in a threatening manner and i feared for my life." 




 with raw story, none, however, the study that it is linked to is. 




 so what the hella you saying?

 that's a really good question. i only knew i had switched over when i got gendered female over the phone while talking to a bank rep. first i cracked the biggest smile ever, but then i stopped and asked myself when the heck i switched over, because the only thing i consciously did was to stop resonating. the pitch i must have unconsciously raised over time.  




 i dont think anybody here is under any illusions that bernie will win the nomination. what he's doing is shifting the conversation and the attitudes of the democrats to the left, where they should be. if the tea party shows us where the hard right is, then bernie shows us where the hard left is.

 i've known people who decide not to transition after psychotherapy. i've known one trans person who detransitioned after ten years. i've known somebody who detransitioned, only to re-transition after two years. transition is pretty personal, and everybody's journey is unique.

The Mod Poodle 




 Warren 2016 




 before i came out, i crossdressed pretty much only to fap too. i was turned on by wearing all the sexy lingerie. then i decided to go out en femme one halloween, i found the frilliest outfit to wear, and i was TERRIFIED of going out like that because i was scared i was going to have a raging boner the whole time thru. once i walked thru that door(took me about half an hour to work up the courage), i was just HAPPY to be dressed as a girl. i loved the feeling of the air swishing past my thighs. 

and once i started hrt, even the morning wood went away. i still love dressing up in sexy lingerie, but only because it makes me feel super sexy. i blame testosterone poisoning, "here, let me take a simple situation AND SEXUALIZE IT TO THE MAX"

seriously, if you're a girl, fuck testoerone. (for the guys, carry on) 




 i know you can use quotes in video submissions, i gotta ask the mods if i can do that in articles without the headline if it's misleading. that's a really good point, thank you 




 yes, earlier 




 it has a link to the actual study 




 good point, thank you for your reply. 




 not in the comments 




 exactly 




 look, 90% marginal rate will never happen, knowing bernie tho, he really means it. also knowing bernie, should he become president, he would also compromise so that he'd settle for a marginal tax around 40%

better to ask for the moon than to start somewhere around 50%. 




 something something party of good christian family values 




 yeah, but rules say i cant change the title 




 cant change the title, remember? 




 no fucking choice, it's the fucking rules 




 this is /r/politics, i gotta go with the actual title of the article 




 But in the rush  to publish everything, how do you guard against fraud? i ask because of the recent controversy over the raw data in the study that showed that gay canvassers swayed voters opinions in a lasting way.

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/26/science/maligned-study-on-gay-marriage-is-shaking-trust.html?partner=socialflow smid=tw-nytimes _r=1

*edit: another article about false and retracted studies

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/23/opinion/whats-behind-big-science-frauds.html 




 a guardian article that referenced the study AND quoted the researchers that collated almost every twin study across the world from the past 50 years.

so yeah, it's a valid news article. 




 josh needs to go for treatment, his parents need to be taken to task, the girls he molested need help too.  




 josh duggar is not a pedophile, he's a sexual abuser. big difference. and his parents are the most at fault here because they covered it up, didnt get him the help he needed, and blamed the girls because of their fucked up version of christianity that they subscribe to. 




 see Bobby Jindal 




 yes 




 missed it by THAT  much 




 they've tried to change the mind to fit the body, and they've shown that it just doesnt work. so that's why the recommended course of treatment for people diagnosed with gender dysphoria is to transition.

http://www.bbc.com/news/health-11814300

so just like how homosexuality was deemed to be not a harmful disorder, so too with being transgender. it is far easier to change the body than to change the mind.   




 uhh, if the Duggars are liberal, i sure as heck dont want to see what they consider a true conservative 




 they can keep on keeping on, their numbers will keep on shrinking right along with that attitude. 




 the Schadenfreude is overwhelming 




 some are, what this brings up is the whole "Nature" vs "Nurture" argument 

http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/19/are-we-products-of-nature-or-nuture-science-answers-age-old-question

science says that it's 50/50 




 cuz it's yours, silly. 




 as a fellow gay transwoman, i have only been able to achieve penetration with help from viagra. the dysphoria down there is just too dang high. has been since the beginning.

on a side note:- arent girl orgasms WAY better than boy orgasms? like holyshitballs batman. 




 right? 




 hey, i've removed your comment because of the "fucking exclusive dude club" bit. we try to be inclusive here, and that also means NOT picking on the people who DO identify with the binary.

if you'd like to repost the comment with something less judgemental like "no, i didnt want into the dude club," it'd be better. 




 *sigh*

i'm sorry, i'm a li'l jumpy, i spent too long replying to the anti-abortionists in this thread. a woman should have a choice, dammit, i just wish people could see that. i'm pro-life, i think we ALL are, i just believe that abortion should be the last resort, but i DO believe that the choice should ultimately belong to the woman whose child it is. 




 please see

"if you cannot force a person to have a blood transfusion even if it will save their life, if you cannot harvest viable organs from dead people unless they consented prior, then you cannot force women to NOT have an abortion. case closed." 




 tell me about it 




 for a kiss? yeeeesh 




 i'm still male on my singapore IC, female on my ID in the US 




 i came out as trans when i was 39, i know people who have come out as gay, genderqueer, lesbian, and all things inbetween on the spectra  of gender and sexuality at all ages.

it is NEVER too late 




 the fetus cannot survive outside of the mother's body until the third trimester, until then she has every right to abort the fetus is she so chooses.

again, it's pretty simple.  




 ok, let's take this from the top, shall we?

the jews werent growing inside the germans' bodies. babies are. if you cannot force a person to have a blood transfusion even if it will save their life, if you cannot harvest viable organs from dead people unless they consented prior, then you cannot force women to NOT have an abortion. case closed.

come back with a different analogy, one that doesnt involve nazis. 




 *sigh* again with the concentration camp analogies. just stop already. whatever women want to do with their bodies is really up to them.  




 yeeeeeeeeeeeup 




 first and second trimester, the fetus is dependant on the mother's body to survive, therefore any and all medical decisions, including whether or not to abort lies solely with the mother. end of story. you may not agree with it, but if we cannot force someone to get a blood transfusion to save their life, and we cannot harvest viable organs from their body after they die, then we cannot force a person not to have an abortion. it's really that simple. 




 we're all pro-life, some of us just believe that sometimes abortion becomes ncessary 




 we're talking about the first and second trimester 




 no, it supports pro choice. because at the end of the day, if the fetus is still in its first or second trimester, than the choice lies with the mother. 




 http://www.lifenews.com/2013/11/07/pro-choice-blogger-promotes-10-reasons-to-have-an-abortion/ 




 you're welcome 




 the fetus is dependent on the mother to survive until the third trimester, until then, the decision on what to do with the pregnancy lies solely with the mother.

suicide should be legal if the person is of sound mental health.

a woman chooses to have sex, not to have a baby. should a pregnancy arise because the woman had sex, then the choice of what to do with said pregnancy lies only with her up to the third trimester.

pretty simple actually. 




 in the third tri-mester, yes. which is why there are restrictions on late term abortions 




 the baby is dependant on the mother for life, therefore, any medical decisions rests soley with her.  




 we shouldnt be blaming immigrants for contributing to the drought 




 and they still use a majority of the water. whatever they put back will still be less than what was taken out, so the water level in the reservoirs drop to the point where we're in the current crisis. it's unsustainable.  




 but that person doesnt have to be the mother, it cant be someone else. so if the mother decides she doesnt want to take care of the baby, she can give it up for adoption. 




 you cannot make medical decisions for another person, pretty simple actually, even if you vehemently disagree with those decisions.   




 an unborn child is dependent on the mother's body to survive, so all medical decisions rest with her. once the fetus becomes viable outside the mother's body is when abortion is restricted, which is why almost every country in the world has restrictions on third trimester abortions. 




 actually, no, because the medical descion of what can and cannot be done rests with the individual, in this case, the mother. you cannot force anyone to have or not have a medical procedure they do or do not want to have. so you cannot force a jehovah's witness to receive a blood transfusion even if it to save their life. you cannot remove viable organs from a recently deceased person, even if it is to save another person's life, because even dead bodies have certain rights. the right to have an abortion lies solely with the mother. end of story. 




 except that statewide, average water use is roughly 50% environmental, 40% agricultural, and only 10% urban. population has minimal impact on water use, it's the agriculture that's sucking cali dry 




 yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeup 




 *sigh* 




 um. wat. 




 uhhhh.....

how did he get elected again? 




 any medical decisions pertaining to the mother's body rest with her, unless she is incapacitated. if you cannot force a jehovah's witness to have something as simple as a blood transfusion to save their own life, then you cannot force a woman to NOT have an abortion. pretty simple. 

 




 abortion is a medical decision, which rests with the mother, who has final say. 




 he's that predictable? 




 but it still comes down to the fact that we cannot make ANY medical decisions for the woman, we cant make a jehovah's witness have a blood transfusion, even if it is to save her life.  




 ahhhh, the old "abortion clinics are like nazi concentration camps." well, let's see where that analogy breaks down, shall we? the jews werent growing inside another human being, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand we're done.  




 because that unborn human is growing inside of another human being with rights over her body, whom we cannot force to do anything she doesnt want to do. 




 because you cant even force a jehovah's witness  to have a simple blood transfusion, even if it's to save their life. therefore, you cannot force a woman NOT to have an abortion. it's not your body. 




 making college free would enable more people to get an education who would normally never be able to get one 




 because the bottom line is that other people do not get to decide what a person does with his or her body. we cant even take viable organs from dead bodies, because even dead bodies have rights.  




 ;-) 




 it's not your body, you cannot decide for another person what to do with her body, it is as simple as that. 




 no, it should be up to the woman to decide 




 because heaven forbid that we hear from the ones who didnt die 




 1) Staff Sergeant Eric Fidelis Alva EARNED a Purple Heart. 

2) it's Memorial Day

he gets to say whatever the hell is on his mind.  




 that knocking sound almost drove me to madness. every time i heard it, i wanted to pick up the monitor and hurl it at the wall.

 cool! should happen any moment then.....

 http://www.therichest.com/expensive-lifestyle/entertainment/10-of-the-hottest-female-celebs-with-big-feet/

as for the height? have you scrolled thru /r/tall? you're one of the shorter girls there. i'm 5'11" and i rock 5 inch heels all the time. (size 9.5 shoe)

who knew that tall girls have big feet? /s

took me a year before i finally saw a girl staring back at me in the mirror.

and listen, your mom can call you a jabberwocky for all that it matters, it doesnt make it true. you know you're a girl, nothing on this plane of existence or beyond can change that fact.

that's the pesky thing about facts, they're true whether people choose to believe in them or not.

you're a girl. simple as that. 




 something something, separation of church and state 




 y'all do guilt at expert level. like i'm asian, and i get the whole "we're very disappointed in you" speech from my mom and dad, but my ex got the third degree, like her dad would keep telling her how they spent all the money to make sure she was raised right, went to church, bought all the clothes for her,cooked, cleaned up after her. 

like i said, at the end of it i was gonna volunteer as tribute. jeez. 




 i dont envy you the guilt trip your parents are gonna lay down on you. i would feel SO bad when my ex got into it with her parents. like it would get so bad that sometimes i felt that  I  should detransition for them. Korean guilt, on par with jewish mom level.  




 pffffffffffffft, no worries there, i'd run out of fingers and toes on five people before i ran out of friends in the bay area. shoot me a PM when you're here and i'll get the info on a few therapists and endos for you. 




 which city are you going to for your studies? if it's a big one, i prolly have friends there and i can get the info of the therapists in that area that they see. 




 because an education is never wasted. because all the people who graduated from college should give back so that others can have the same opportunity they did 




 ha, if you're  coming to the states, get all the documentation you need from therapists here. the hormones will be covered under your school's health insurance. 

and as far as me ex, we broke up before she heard back from the military, so i cant help you there. i'll text her and ask for you. 




 http://www.rawstory.com/2015/05/watch-bernie-sanders-blows-wolf-blitzers-mind-with-plan-to-make-college-free-by-taxing-wall-street/ 




 well, have you been diagnosed with gender dysphoria? and are you out to your parents? my Korean ex-girlfriend was in the same boat as you are, but she came to the US on a student visa and transitioned here, so she has an official diagnosis and a letter she sent back asking for an exemption. 




 have you read this?

http://www.koreaobserver.com/trans-woman-files-complaint-against-military-over-surgical-castration-24136/

(dont read the comments)

*edit: also, this 

"On March 2013 Seoul Western District Court ruled that five female-to-male transgender individuals can be registed as male without sex reassignment surgery." 




 well, having served in the army, i can tell you that in some ways, it's actually easier, because every minute of every day is planned for you, and when you DO have down time, you're so exhausted, you usually sleep.

also, if your service is mandatory like israel, singapore, taiwan, south korea etc, there's usually an exemption for trans people.

do you want to talk about it? i could prolly find the regulation on service exemption if you tell me what country you're from

 




 the article directly quotes Hasselback, American Family Association, and Penny Nance, all saying terrible things about trans people, as well as anti trans bathroom bills in states like Florida and Nevada brought up by republican legislators. 

the science is settled, the repuvblicans are the ones making it a political issue. 




 so you're saying that those republicans didnt say the things they are on record saying about trans people? 




 i was 7, so i dont remember thinking about gender at all. but then i saw a documentary about a bunch of trans girl prostitutes working to save up for reassignment surgery. after that, i pretty much thought about it pretty much non-stop til i came out..... 33 years later. :-p 




 there's a reason i havent gone back in twenty years 




 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand now i'm crying all over again. 




 And the founder of a chain of Christian treatment center Josh was sent to, resigned in 2014 under a cloud of accusations that he had sexually groomed and harassed young women and teens in his ministry.

the only thing missing from this circus is a clown car..... oh wait 




 something something hypocrisy of "family values" 




 hmmm, you raise a good point there. i didnt even think about it in that way. 




 as a queer trans girl lesbian, it makes me happy to read the comments of lgbt support in this thread 




 From the WPATH Standards of Care

A mental health screening and/or assessment is needed for referral to hormonal
and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria. In contrast, psychotherapyalthough highly
recommendedis not a requirement. 

The SOC do not recommend a minimum number of psychotherapy sessions prior to hormone
therapy or surgery. The reasons for this are multifaceted (Lev, 2009). First, a minimum number of
sessions tends to be construed as a hurdle, which discourages the genuine opportunity for personal
growth. Second, mental health professionals can offer important support to clients throughout
all phases of exploration of gender identity, gender expression, and possible transitionnot just
prior to any possible medical interventions. Third, clients and their psychotherapists differ in their
abilities to attain similar goals in a specified time period.

And RLE is only require for GCS,  not HRT

From the WPATH SoC:

The current Board of Directors of the WPATH herewith expresses its conviction that sex (gender) reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures. Genital reconstruction is not required for social gender recognition, and such surgery should not be a prerequisite for document or record changes; the Real Life Experience component of the transition process is crucial to psychological adjustment, and is usually completed prior to any genital reconstruction, when appropriate for the patient, according to the WPATH Standards of Care. Changes to documentation are important aids to social functioning, and are a necessary component of the pre-surgical process; delay of document changes may have a deleterious impact on a patient's social integration and personal safety.
 




 people engage in different ways, but there has to be a spark somewhere. take this sub, for instance, i'm sure there are many more lay people with only a cursory understanding of science that get so much more knowledge simply from reading the studies posted here and asking questions because they dont understand an aspect of the study and have someone more knowledgeable answer the question in a way that give the questioner a deeper understanding of the  topic of discussion. 




 well, they said in the article that the most likely application was for electric car batteries and home storage batteries. 




 but if you present it in a fun way that actually encourages understanding and prompts follow up questions and a desire to further one's knowledge, then we all win.

i've seen studies done on beer, and pot, and laughter, and poker. science CAN be fun too. 




 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFqHlliWmVY 




 Ezekiel 16:49 "Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy." 




 to be fair, they DID say that these were EARLY results, and even mentioned the potential weakness of the battery with the lithium anode in terms of long-term stability and safety 




 i have never seen so many messages in my inbox. lots of them were from my friends with nothing but support. had a few from bible thumping friends i had when i was going to an all boys christian school and ten years of summer bible camp. those werent too fun, mostly cuz they were along the lines of "god doesnt make mistakes" and "i'll pray for you to see the light" or some other ineffectual bullshit. 

family was the hardest, my parents didnt take it too well, nor my religious aunt and cousin. i have a really big fam fam, and only two of my cousins talk to me right now. 

my friends are my family now. i honestly thought i'd have to go thru transition by myself, and my friends made me cry because not only did they support me, but they wanted to come along for the ride. and that made me smile inside, even tho i was bawling my eyes out like a baby.

it's been a blast, and i dont regret it one bit. 
























 admission is the first step, we'll get thru this together 




 see, at least you can admit when you're wrong 




 http://mediamatters.org/research/2015/06/03/17-school-districts-debunk-right-wing-lies-abou/203867

will you look at that 




 nope 




 dont be so hard on yourself, you're only human, you make mistakes 




 there's always Minnesota... 




 at least we've shown that you dont always need religion to be transphobic 




 dont hurt yourself. i know it's hard to acknowledge the fact that you've been transphobic, but we can get thru this. 




 i know, it's ok, maybe you'll see the light and stop being transphobic in the light of medical science. until then, i can only hope you dont embarrass yourself further by arguing against gravity. 




 whoops, missed that. sorry, got all excited 




 nice when science shuts someone up.

thanks for playing, please try again later. 




 true dat 




 http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm

say what now? 




 they'd actually see me as female. so if looks are your criteria, plenty of trans women would meet that. but why discriminate based on something so cosmetic? put a dor in front of the shower and wekre good to go. 




 if it walks like a duck, and talks like a duck.... 




 hell, it's pakistan, for a woman just speaking up is probably a radical act 




 oh yeah, you made it pretty clear you were transphobic. 




 by mary cheney no less 




 misgendering again. doesnt take much to treat another person with empathy and respect, which you dont seem to want to do.  




 misgendering again. i didnt do anything except show your own transphobia. you may not want to admit it. but it's true. the simple act of misgendering someone means you dont give a single shit about the person. we're people, all we want to do is go into the restroom of of gender, do our business and get the hell out of there. most trans people dont want to spend any more time in there than we can help because of people like you.  and we'll keep on doing it, because most of the time, peopl elike you wont even have a clue.

thanks for playing. maybe one day the world will have fewer transphobic people like you. until then, i wont advertise the fact that i'm trans and keep on using the dang women's restroom BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN.

pretty simple. 




 just being true to myself, as are all other trans people. and you know what. you'll never know. the dude bro washing his hands next to you might actually have a vajayjay. 

have a good one. i'll be in the women's restroom

thanks for playing. 




 thank goodness it doesnt matter what you think, i'm a girl, no matter if i have a penis, and i'm going to CONTINUE to use the girls restroom because that's what i identify as.  jees, it aint that hard.

and putting laws that restrict MY access to it because you're worried about somebody else exploiting it is ridonkulous. 




  I AM saying you have no business making everyone else uncomfortable because you don't want to use the bathroom that you are built for.

ok, right there, that's textbook transphobia. the bathroom i was built for? please, i've used both boys and girls bathrooms, nobody has given a shit, wanna know why? cuz people use the bathrooms because they have to go. nothing more, nothing less.


 I AM saying that if this becomes the norm, it is easily exploitable, and that's a very dangerous thing.

again, unless you can show me a case where a trans person has assaulted another person in a bathroom, you're a solution in search of a problem. 




 i agree 100% 




 nope 




 if you really want to go thru my history, you'll realize that it's MY copypasta. i keep it handy for responses to posts like yours. i'm trans myself, i've DONE my research. i can respond to pretty much any question you have, AND back myself up with links and quotes to a ton of articles i've previously read and researched.

any time you want to have an intellectual conversation, go right ahead. 




 josh was also a minor at the time. look, i'm not defending the piece of shit, he took advantage of those who couldnt defend themselves. but he wasnt a pedophile by legal definition. NOR was he a "confused" child like his parents and pastor suggest.

but calling him a pedophile takes away from the actual issues 




  If I were to answer your question, yes. That's always been a yes.

then you have your answer. because absent everything else, you choose to press that button. which means you DO want to transition.

Position Statement on Access to Care for Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals (2012)  
 The American Psychiatric Association:  
1. Recognizes that appropriately evaluated transgender and gender variant individuals can benefit greatly from medical and surgical gender transition treatments.  
2. Advocates for removal of barriers to care and supports both public and private health insurance coverage for gender transition treatment.  
3. Opposes categorical exclusions of coverage for such medically necessary treatment when prescribed by a physician.

Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals
(2012)  
 Being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities; however, these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression Thus, this position statement is relevant to the APA because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of  transgender and gender variant individuals.  

**The American Psychiatric Association:**  
1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals.  
2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals.  
3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care, employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and licensing.  
4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these individuals greater than that imposed on any other persons.

As stated in the Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity   Gender Expression NonDiscrimination,
the APA opposes all public and private discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived gender identity and expression and urges the repeal of discriminatory laws and policies and calls upon psychologists in their professional roles to provide appropriate, nondiscriminatory treatment to transgender and gender variant individuals and encourages psychologists to take a leadership role in working against discrimination towards transgender and gender variant individuals. 

The APA recognizes the efficacy, benefit and medical necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals and calls upon public and private insurers to cover these medically necessary treatments.

provide coverage for comprehensive care of [transgender] individuals including medical
care, screening tests based on medical need rather than gender, mental health care, and,
when medically necessary, gender reassignment surgery.

**National Commission on Correctional Health Care**


Position Statement: Transgender Health Care in Correctional Settings (2009) 

The health risks of overlooking the particular needs of transgender inmates are so severe that acknowledgment of the problem and policies that assure appropriate and responsible provision of health care are needed.  
Because prisons, jails, and juvenile justice facilities have a responsibility to ensure the physical and mental health and well-being of transgender people in their custody, correctional health staff should manage these inmates in a manner that respects the
biomedical and psychological aspects of a gender identity disorder (GID) diagnosis.

 you're coming at it wrong. let's do the button test, shall we?

assuming everything else stays the same, if you could push that button and wake up tomorrow as a girl and NOBODY would be the wiser. would you push it?

therein lies your answer, because if your heart answered yes even if your head was trying to find a reason to say no, then you know what's right for you. a lot of us fight it. hell, i fought it for 30+ years, i only came out at 39. 

make the appointment with a gender therapist 




 nobody said that religion was logical 




 something something freedom of speech 




 technically, josh was under aged, so he's "just" a sexual abuser 




 hey, tell the huckster not to claim to be god's messenger and we'll be good. 




 i see, so rather than let the trans people use the bathrooms they need to, you'd rather ban them from doing so, in order to stop fundies taking advantage of it.  yeah. how bout no. how bout we let the trans people use the bathrooms they want to use and then go after the ones who are pretending to be trans. pretty easy to do. 




 do you honestly think for a second, that a trans person, IN HIGH SCHOOL, would get naked in front of their school mates? hell, i know i wouldnt. 




 i see, and how many incidents do you think that a trans person has assaulted somebody in a restroom? you can google it, but i'll save you the trouble. zero. nada. zip. 

besides, trans people have been using the restrooms of their gender for ages. it's the fundies that are trying to stir up fear against "a dude in a dress" going in and raping women.

trans women, and it almost always involves trans women, have been assaulted and killed for nothing more than trying to live their lives in the gender that are. 




 that's what my girlfriends say ALL the time, i have to turn them down tho, cuz i'm asexual 




 i post news articles all over the place, i like to read the convos that start. like i sad, aspel, different strokes, different folks 




 and i prefer a free-for-all. different strokes, different folks 




 i just saw that over on /r/politics. that was an awesome read. 




 http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2015/06/02/3665262/huckabee-transgender-shower-feminine/ 




 a girl can dream 




 or just go with gender neutral restrooms. 




 While both serious issues, they are very different. 

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is an anxiety disorder that causes sufferers to spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and to have a distorted view of how they look.

Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there is a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity...This mismatch between sex and gender identity can lead to distressing and uncomfortable feelings that are called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate. It is not a mental illness.

both those definitions are from Britain's National Health Service. With the changes in the new Diagnostic Standards Manual (version V), there has been the removal of disorder in the title of the entry concerning gender identity (which in previous versions was labeled gender identity disorder). Although there are still hold outs, the vast majority of medical professionals and mental healthcare providers agree: if a person with gender dysphoria is having issues with mental illness, which is not uncommon, gender dysphoria is not the underlying cause. Rather, it is society's unwillingness to treat individuals with gender dysphoria with care, dignity, and respect (including necessary medical treatment, when appropriate) which can lead to maladjustment. A great many individuals with gender dysphoria are considered perfectly well-adjusted, the stressors of gender dysphoria being comparable to other stressors associated with any serious medical condition. 




 it's a perfectly normal response, when everybody just assumes jenner's transition is how we all do it, where you just go away for awhile and come back and you're FABULOUS. but think of it this way, she started transitioning in the 80's. and then stopped when she got married to Kris. so she's been stuck in that awkward inbetweeny stage for THIRTY years. and they have said some AWFUL things about her appearance in that time. So she's had a LOT of abuse heaped on her, more so because she's a celebrity.

i know how exhausting it can get with people wanting to talk about you being trans when all you want to do is get on with your life. i try to do trans 101 as often as i can, but i do have those days where i will just go stealth and just get on with my day.

the media storm will pass, but hopefully, people will have gained a more positive outlook and a little understanding about what it is to be trans. 




 they're rare, but they do exist

Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals
(2012)  
 Being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities; however, these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression Thus, this position statement is relevant to the APA because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of  transgender and gender variant individuals.  

**The American Psychiatric Association:**  
1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals.  
2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals.  
3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care, employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and licensing.  
4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these individuals greater than that imposed on any other persons.

WPATH found that decades of experience with the Standards of Care show gender transitions and related care to be accepted, good medical practice and effective treatment.  
In a 2008 clarification, WPATH stated:

[S]ex reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures...


The medical procedures attendant to sex reassignment are not cosmetic or elective or for the mere convenience of the patient. These reconstructive procedures are not optional in any meaningful sense, but are understood to be medically necessary for the treatment of the diagnosed condition.

**National Commission on Correctional Health Care**


Position Statement: Transgender Health Care in Correctional Settings (2009) 

The health risks of overlooking the particular needs of transgender inmates are so severe that acknowledgment of the problem and policies that assure appropriate and responsible provision of health care are needed.  
Because prisons, jails, and juvenile justice facilities have a responsibility to ensure the physical and mental health and well-being of transgender people in their custody, correctional health staff should manage these inmates in a manner that respects the
biomedical and psychological aspects of a gender identity disorder (GID) diagnosis.

 biologists would beg to differ

http://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943 




 body dysmorphia is different from gender dysphoria. 




 welllllllllll, that's not quite true, i'm a trans female and i am VERY attracted to girls. and i know plenty of other trans people, both girls and guys who are gay. 




 oh, i thought you wanted to argue medical definitions, legal? jenner had her documentation changed, so legally, she's a woman. glad you simplified it.

thanks for playing. 




 lol ;-) 




 thankfully, medical science disagrees with you 




 no using the "r" word please 




 My friend from D.C. told me that  it's BLM combined with BSEE/BOMRE ... and the problem is, those bureaus are essentially self-sustaining (much like the Forest Service) by leasing these public lands. 




 which proves my point, your organs and your genitalia do not make up who you are as a person. a woman is a woman, even if she lacks a womb, or ovaries, or happens to have been assigned male at birth 




 but no womb. our organs and our genitals do not make us who we are. we think, therefore we are. it's a very deep philosophical discussion, actually  




 http://www.newsweek.com/first-successful-birth-womb-transplant-sweden-275376

say what now? 




 http://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943

no, we're not 




 i was 7 when i saw a documentary about trans women. the light went on and i knew i was one of them. i'm 42 now. guess what, it WASNT a phase 




  2015 ICD-10-CM Z72.51 High risk heterosexual behavior

just because there's a code for it, doesnt mean it applies to everybody. 




 we are not defined by our genitals 




 exactly, and the admins ban by IP, so no alts. perma ban ban. bye bye birdie 




 see, i usually keep it going because they eventually break down and let lose with a lot of swearing and threats. and then i report it to the admins and get all of their accounts banned 




 yes it is

 




 yes it is 




 and miss out on all the fun? ;-) 




 yes it is. 




 yes it is. 




 it is bigoted to go against a trans person's gender. which you have, which makes you a bigot. see? wasnt that easy. 




 yes, you've said that, and you agree with bryan fischer, you are both bigots. we've established this already. 




 ah but i am a seeker of knowledge. i will happily believe in a god as soon as i have proof. show me a sign of your god's existence! i have been trying to summon a god the wrong way all this time. please show me how 




 about a third of all trans people would disagree with you. assuming 700k trans peoplein the US, that makes about 230k-ish. it happens way more often than you think. i'm trans, i'm also a lesbian, so are a whole bhunch of my trans friends both guy and girl. 




 nah, having way more fun showing you how wrong and bigoted you are. medical science says trans people exist. and unqualified person like you is saying we dont. lemme seeeeee...... i'll go with medical science! 




 you're not rendering an opinion, you're intentionally misgendering a trans person. and that is the very definition of transphobia.  




 you're welcome! 




 http://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943

not just about the chromosomes  




 actually, no, because there isnt any medical science backing up your claim. try again. 




 I SUMMON YOU GOD TO APPEAR BEFORE ME.

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand nothing happens.

therefore, i posit that there is no god. should i have gone wrong somewhere in my methodology, please advise on what i have to change in order to summon a god. 




 actually, that kinda is, when you reduce a person to their genitals. 




 well, several medical associations would beg to differ with you

 like i said, belittling and invalidating trans people. but you go on right ahead making fun of people who have gender dysphoria. and i see you dont think trans men exist.  




  I find it funny that you are mocking Fox News for mocking a man pretending to be a woman.

that you like belittling and invalidating trans people. 




 you would ;-) 




 no, but i can express how much i detest your opinion 




 and in return we get to tell you how much we disagree with you.
gotta love that whole freedom of speech. you're free to share your opinion, but so am i. 




 stereotyping by referring to all the times they have actually BEEN the biggest asshats on the planet? i think that's just stating facts. 




 or, you know, just refer to the DSM V, you know the big book of medical answers that the doctors refer to in order to come to a diagnosis.

In the upcoming fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5),
people whose gender at birth is contrary to the one they identify with will be diagnosed with gender
dysphoria. This diagnosis is a revision of DSM-IVs criteria for gender identity disorder and is intended
to better characterize the experiences of affected children, adolescents, and adults.

 sex and gender are two different things. sex is who you go to bed with, gender is who you go to bed as. 




 hey, if Prince can do it.... 




 she, you gotta use female pronouns now 




 lots of us love her. she done a whole lot to change people's attitudes in a VERY short amount of time. 




 the artist formerly known as bruce jenner 




 i would like if the whole world had this attitude to trans people. it would make my life a whole lot better, as opposed to constantly being asked what parts i happen to have under my dress. 




 the process is different from state to state. some states allow for change of name and gender by court order, some by doctor's letter. some states will allow you to change the gender on your birth certificate, some dont, some allow you to change it only if you have had reassignment surgery.

i live in california, so my name and gender change was pretty easy, i made an appointment at the court, went before the judge and got a court ordered name and gender change. i then went to the dmv and the social security office and gave them the court order and they changed my name and gender. 

same with the bank. and all the other agencies i had to deal with, power company, phone, internet, insurance, etc.

 please be civil and respectful 




 please keep it civil 




 i'm just concerned that the baby transies will go in there, hear someone say "hey take this dose" and think that it's a one-size-fits-all kinda deal. you know how impatient some of us are to start. 

i just want to make sure that they know what the risks are of self-medding AND give them all the info they need if they choose to do it anyway.  




 spoken like someone with no clue about what it means to be transgender. 




 like i said, it's totally condescending to women, and it prioritizes the man's needs above that of the woman's. the whole tone is demeaning and dismissive of women. 




 now who's taking stuff out of context. 




 i know why the admins did it, it's obviously to cover their ass. but people actually DO go to /r/asktransgender for medical advice. and i just want to be sure that people know that we arent doctors and that even if we were, we still couldnt advise them without examining them in the first place. 

we all know people who self-med, either because they couldnt spend one more day as the gender they werent, or because they had no access to meds. 

at the same time, there's no one standard dose because everybody's body is different.

i think if people know the entire range of dosages available as well as what a typical person's hormone range is, then they'll have enough info to make a decision.

 




 the whole article is condescending to women, as if only the man's needs are paramount. it's all about how to get her in the mood so she consents. if she  says no, then it means no. 




 hey, sorry for piggygreenfingers' comments. lots of us struggle with weight. but my take on it is that you should think of your health first. i know lots of girls (and guys) who have lost lots of weight after coming out. amazing what not constantly thinking about your gender will do for your happiness. we all have the fear of not passing. i had it for the first year before i relaxed enough to see that if everybody else around me was gendering me female, then i should too.

 good point 




 yeesh, sorry for letting it get that far. i was getting a little hot under the collar. my mom always said to stay away from religion and politics. 




 right, right, so Hitler wasnt a "real" Christian. how very convenient. listen, if it walks like a christian, and talks like a christian, then for all intent and purposes, HE'S A CHRISTIAN. look at all the "bad" popes thru history. some of them had multiple concubines for crying out loud, THEY FATHERED CHILDREN. so that makes them any less "christian" because they did something bad? no. same applies to hitler. all those priests that molested children, are they any less "christian" 

but you keep right on believing that there's a difference.

 




 ah, so you also read

Hitler was not excommunicated[5] prior to his suicide. The biographer John Toland noted Hitler's anticlericalism but considered him still in "good standing" with the Church by 1941 




 then did you not read in the same wiki

In Mein Kampf, Hitler makes a number of religious allusions, claiming to be "acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator" and to have been chosen by providence.[14][20] In a 1922 speech he said,"My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter [...] who [...] recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them..."[21] In a 1928 speech, he said: "We tolerate no one in our ranks who attacks the ideas of Christianity ... in fact our movement is Christian." 




 hitler was christian 




 they lost their collective marbles over constantine 




 not on tv 




 pssst, there is no god. 




 holy shitballs, people talk about it all the time, but going thru it is an experience unto itself. wow. blew my fucking mind. 




 whoooooo boy, do you ever feel. before i started on estrogen, it was like i was watching a black and white tv with the volume turned all the way down. once i started, it was like technicolor went wild and i was living in willy wonka land with neon colored flashing light and the music cranked up to 11. i remember having to pull over to the side of the freeway just to have a good cry for no apparent reason. i gradually became used to it, and i exist in a happy medium right now, but i feel way more emotion than i did before. thank god.

but again, everybody's body is different, so ymmv 




 here, try this

 this should help

 because i look NOTHING like a male anymore

http://imgur.com/a/l65Jh 




 *sigh*

did i also mention that i was trans? flying back with a male passport will be kinda sucky. blech. 




 now you just made me hungry 




 singaporean here too, i left a long long time ago. maybe one day i'll go back, but it'll be for the food and nothing else. mmmmmmmm. god i miss the food. 




 psssst.....

there is no god 




 it's always a god for you. cant you see that it's a better world when you realize that there is no god? that you have but one life to live.
 you could have easily ended the convo hours ago, by simply pointing out proof, ANY proof that your god exists. you havent, so we go on dancing. i'm quite enjoying this. i can to tell you that there is no god, and there's nothing you can do about it, because you know i'm right. 

amazing isnt it? one simple statement of fact as opposed to reams and reams of oratory as priests and pastors struggle to try and convince the flock every weekend that there is a god when half of them dont believe it themselves.

so, in conclusion, i submit, yet again, that there is no god. 




 you're welcome, any time i can help a struggling theist be comfortable with the fact that there is no god, i consider a successful day.

here are some resources if you need.

lumoreno@chla.usc.edu

if you dont get a hold of him by phone, email him, he'll go over all the requirements with you. they have a therapist you can talk to, and dr olsen is great. they have a tiny group meeting every wednesday during the day if you can make it. 




 yeah, the one thing that surprised me was how much it affected some people. one of my really good, really old friends pretty much had the same reaction as your friend did. 

you have to give them a moment to have a moment. they go thru the same stages of grief as you would losing somebody. it's silly, but that's what happens.

you've had years to think this over, it's ALL new to them, and it can be a little overwhelming. i cant tell you how surprised i was when a few of my friends needed MY support in dealing with it.

cracked me up to no end.

so just give your friend a little time. just talk thru their fears, try and make them see that they're not losing you at all. it'll still be you, just in a body that you're more comfortable in. 




 well, call the la lgbt center, they have a great trans program and they're very knowledgeable. are you under 25? do you have insurance? a yes to both those questions means you could go thru the LA Children's hospital. they're great too. also, there's a group that meets every friday at the la lgbt center, be good for you if you want to hang around a bunch of trans people.  




 yup, i sure do. doesnt stop me from liking other girls too. that one is just the one at the top. 




 who said anything about denying people? my last girlfriend was asian, the girlfriend before that was dark haired russian. my current girlfriends are white, but both of them are brunette. all i said was that i prefer blonds. again, merely stating a preference. 




 we are both atheists, i merely believe in one less god than you. come, just let go of one more god. it'll be ok, there are other who live their life by logic and science. 

just repeat after me


there is no god 




 please be respectful, and civil. 




 nah, why waste time

come be one with the unbelievers, we can help you. all you need to do is let it go. 




 lmao, this deep into the thread, and all you had to do to end it was to show me proof of god. you havent. isnt it time you stopped believing in a faerie tale? come out as an unbeliever, we have great cookies. you cannot prove your god exists. it would be the easiest way to convert people. show us he exists. and we'll follow. light all the candles, sing all the hymn. 

god doesnt exist. never has. never will.

amen. 




 no, only dating white girls because you believe that the white race is superior and all other races should bow before you and kiss the ground you walk on is racist. me? i just have a preference for blonds.  




 feel free 




 it's ok to let go of the idea of god. i know it's scary, it always is to let go of something that you've thought was solid bedrock, only to see, once the wool has been taken away from your eyes, to be nothing more than shifting sand.

it's ok. 

it'll be ok.

let go of your god and let him drift away on the wind that created him in teh first place.

come be with the free folk, those of us who live life fully engaged in the world, where we live for THIS life, because we know that this is the only life we get. 




 prove god exists, otherwise, no god exists. pretty simple, eh? 




 well, i did it the way i knew how, but obviously i must have done something wrong. could you please point out where i went wrong? perhaps a summoning spell is in order? this is the only way i know how to prove that a god does not exist. 

 




 you're welcome 




 ah, so you can prove that a god exists, good, now we're getting somewhere. how does one prove the existence of god. 




 you called it "fake genitalia", it's not

you said that post-op vaginas are incapable of self-lubrication, they are

you said we shouldnt expect to be able to fully orgasm, that's incorrect

so pretty much your entire post. 




 well, let's review shall we? you've asked me to prove that there is no god, which i have. but you seem to disagree with my methods of summoning a god. so i have repeatedly asked you what the proper way of summoning a god is, which you have not provided. failing that, i've asked you how you can prove that there is a god, but i'm still waiting for that proof. 

again, should you provided me a single shred of evidence that a god exists, i will happily change my mind. isnt that what you are called to do in your faith? well, i'm asking. please prove that your god exists, and i will add my name to the roster of true believers.

CAN I GET AN AMEN??? 




 Please be respectful  




 again, my apologies if i did something wrong, i am more than happy to correct my ways. if you can show me how to summon a god, i will be happy to do so.

you asked me to prove that there is no god, and i showed you the way i test it. if you have a test that shows otherwise, i'll be happy to change my mind. 




 easy, if god is with me, i summon them into a form of a storm cloud in the shape of a unicorn with three legs.

nope. nothing happened.

so, therefore, god does not exist.

again, if i'm doing something wrong in summoning him, i'd be open to suggestions on the correct way of summoning a god. 




 you mean this kind of "treatment"?

http://www.people.com/article/inside-josh-duggar-treatment-
 




 you're entitled to your opinion, but it just seemed like you were really down on cis people. 




 look, some people have a type, i, for example, like blondes, and white girls. it's a preference. not all chasers are bad. i'm VERY attracted to trans girls. altho the invites i've received thru OKCupid are a thing of beauty to behold. lots of them are pretty much "does your dick still work? cuz if yes, that's hot, wanna fuck?" 




 well that i agree with, but you've had a pretty negative tone when you've commented about cis people.  




 please be respectful 




 so get yourself a nice trans girl who likes to use hers. problem solved! 




 well yeah, it is kinda out of the ordinary to tell people that you're trans. we're such a small minority of the population. i've had non-stop convos with people at parties when i tell them. it's a great icebreaker. i can just keep going thru the whole party. met some really great people that way. 




 lol, get used to not getting your way. just because we will not tolerate your intolerance. go spread the hate somewhere else. the rest of us will happily get along without religion.

i respectfully disagree with your assessment. i dont know what it was in your past that has turned you so against cis people, but i count a great many cis people as my friends, and they have been nothing but supportive.  and, according to the poll, so are most americans. 




 yeah, you kinda left out the conversion therapy places, the jesus camps. the pastors, the christian leaders. 




 there will always be people who have been hurt, badly, and will always see the negative. we can only respond with positives and try to bring them around. 




 even our own allies have been known to be transphobic. stephen colbert as well, conan o'brien. conan used the t-slur and when people complained, he apologized immediately saying that he didnt know it was a slur and that it would never be used on the show again. it made me so happy to hear. 

so yes, i will always give people the benefit of the doubt. 




 most of the cis people i've told have been confused, but positive in their reactions. i've had one or two bible thumpers tell me i'm going to hell, but i just chalk it up to religious brainwashing.  




 dont confuse a lack of understanding with transphobia, i know it may be frustrating to have to do trans 101 over and over again, but even with all the trans coverage in the media, there are still some people who dont get it.

i DO agree with you about some people being transphobic. i've got some internalized transphobia myself with recent MtF transitioners. i catch myself ALL the time. it's not something that i'm proud of, but i try to push thru it. 




 they werent hiding behind religion, now were they? the great atrocities were done in the name of religion   




  And it was. 

no it wasnt. the proper treatment would have been to report it to the authorities and have him immediately taken away for treatment. AWAY from the other girls so that he couldnt assault others. THAT is the proper treatment. 




 it's all good, i know some things really get us going. 




 dont diss the cis. we cant win this war without our cis allies. while it is true that cis people have a hard time understanding what it means to be trans, not all of them are actively working against us. 




 hey, i know things can get heated sometimes, but please refrain from personal attacks, i'm going to tell /u/evendeathmaydie the same thing 




 easy as pie

I SUMMON YOU GOD

nothing happened

there, i just proved that god does not exist. 




  How many "underage" girls did YOU try to "molest" when you were 14-17 years old?

for me and millions of other kids, none. what josh duggar did was a sexual assault. and instead of getting caught and sent for treatment, his parents did nothing. for the girls who were assaulted, NOTHING was done. and for you to try and defend such a sexual assault as a normal course of puberty is absolutely disgusting.  




 the jews sent to the camps were poles, hungarians, germans, italians, french, austrian, ukranian, etc. it was an attempt to exterminate an entire religion.

knock yourself out.

the bible has more holes than swiss cheese. and it's got so many versions that nobody knows what the hell it originally looked like. 




 there are none so blind as those that will not see
