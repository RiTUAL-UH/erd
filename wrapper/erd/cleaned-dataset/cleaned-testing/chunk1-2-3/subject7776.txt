 During school I am perfectly fine, I laugh (Well... giggle), smile, and am generally a positive person. I get all my work done in class, I never have homework, I help out people when asked. I try my best to just help. But when I get home I am instantly having suicidal thoughts, I fight with my girlfriend, and I just overall hate everything.

I feel like I'm just a horrible person, I believe I have let my father down. He wanted a smart child who likes what he is into, But I'm not smart in my eyes, and I don't like sports and NASCAR and all of that stuff, I tried to play sports to please him but after I cracked my head I said "I don't want to play sports again" and I haven't. I like games, and girls...
I've never heard my parents say "I love you." I know its hard to believe but I just haven't. They don't go out on dates, or kiss or anything. I feel like its my fault.
People think, "Oh Travis, You have it was easy you get what you want and can do whatever."
But getting what I want isn't fine. My parents do not have a college savings account for me, nor my brother. My brother (who is smart) got a little bit of a scholarship and it makes it easy for him to go. I, however will not get a scholarship, I don't get 100% on tests and I don't do the best work.
So, I don't know what I'll do for college. I don't want my family to take out another loan. I would like my parents to just go out on dates, and act like a married couple.
I take medicine but the dosage seems to be too small, if I take 2 I'm happy all day and everything is fine.
I noticed myself getting depressed after a break-up, I tried so hard to make everything up and talk to her, I wrote a 6 page letter to her, and she just ignored it. Awhile later I had tried to search our home for a pistol we keep for safety. I searched often when no one was home and could never find it, and I'd usually end up sitting on the bed and crying.
On my birthday, sadly, I had tried to OD. My birthday wasn't good.

I don't want to die, and I don't want to have these thoughts, but they won't leave me alone. I just want to have my parents be a couple, I want my my father to say hes proud of me, And I want to be happy.

Help? 




 Ah, thank you. And one last thing, do you know how much a Gold Botkiller Rocket Launcher is? 




 Thank you, so its 20keys or a bud? 




 Thank you! 




 What are the prices on these?

 For the love of all the is tasty, I need a box or two. D: I miss them! 




 But... But... I want some too.. 




 I'm from Arizona, we don't have much but if you like any Arizonian snack and you happen to have some Oreo O's, I will gladly try my best to get the snack you want! 




 Can/Will/Does anyone have Oreo O's that they can ship to Arizona, USA?

I was way out in x 800 z -3000, in giant open fields and no town near, and I starved.. so please put animals in.

 I did Nazi that coming. 




 Too soon it seems. 




 Reason why I own Photoshop, is for things like this. 









 Thanks man :DDDDD 




 Hell yeah! :D 




 I put it on the pandas forehead, seeing as it wont go to the bottom right D: 




 Simple is special ;) 



















 Its fine, I understand that some people don't have the money. 




 I was wondering if any of you fine non-zombie people would actually donate to make a DayZ Lingor Island server in the US. I know a person who is whitelisted for a spot by the Lingor Hive. The only problem is we'd need money to host it. It'd be the only US server.

So, would anyone actually donate? 









 Ah, didn't see. Thanks :D 




 Except for sex. 









 I think this would be an amazing map to play DayZ on. 









 Honestly, its all good. You can keep trying to kill us, like the [NC] Clan. We're waiting. 




 Come at me bro. 




 Thank you for the hour long fire fight, deaths, and walk backs to the hill. I'm sorry a hacker had to come in a ruin the fun, hopefully we can fight again. But why would you have a camp up there in the hill? 




 Back when you spawned with a Mak, I shot a kid for lols. 




 I jumped... 




 Well, you gave me a good impression of the game which led me to buy it. :D 




 When you spawn in it'll say "Day x" (x being the day you've been alive) 




 This is what you get if you upload the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXIpPORrOKo 




 Uploading the video to YouTube at the moment. 




 lol its alpha 




 It was my first character ever made in Day Z, I spawned in Cherno (Though I didn't know that was its name). I had somehow found a friend, who was new as well and thought me how to use voice comm. We went around the building and found the hospital. I stumbled upon some Anti-Biotics and headed up the roof. I called for my friend to come look at the view and I made a dash for the ladder to see if he was coming, I ran off the roof and died instantly. 




 Oh, you fancy huh? 




 LOL 




 Yes. Yes. Yes. 




 wow, we're all in Chandler!! 




 A girl who likes me sent this to me, it always makes me smile.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0Ohl3MMq0o

Shes an amazing girl.

I mean really. 




 lol dont join unless you like to get raped by the AI 









 ART! D: 




 Russian server, very peaceful. 




 Welcome to the dark side, we've been expecting you. 














 I'm sorry, I don't have enough money to gift you it. Hopefully someone else will help you! I'm sorry. Have faith! The reddit community is full of good, friendly, and kind people! Hope to see you around DayZ sometime, hopefully soon ;)! 




 I know what I'm going to do now...

I keep reading this, its just so good.. 




 It'd be amazing getting a free copy, I could play with my friend who I literally do everything with, It'd just be nice to finally play a survival game with her and not play WoW all the time. Thank you for being super generous. Have a wonderful day. 




 I feel like I've killed you before... 




 Most of the day. 




 I did this today as well. TX20, It's very fun. 




 Contact me here or VIA steam. (test_subject7776) 




 Amazing shot. 




 fags. 




 LOL
Oh god, Olive, you, you're a funny man. 




 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVvxCdNv2vc 









 Ah, thank you both very much! :D 




 I was wondering what Add-on you need in order to have high quality skins and such? Any help would be appreciated! 




 Must have. 




 T'is a big bitch. 




 We're not mad. :P 




 So we were playing Day Z (7 of us) and we were in an open field checking a deer stand (of course it had nothing), we heard a shot and one of us died, we all proned down and DC'd. (Yes wussy move, wanna fight about it?) We reconnected to a new server and messed around in the field recollecting ourselves and healing our injured. The moment we were all ready to go we heard another shot and again, another friend got shot and died. We all hit the deck and now we're just waiting it all out.

Now I'm scared. 




 AHHHH THIS GUY! 




 You lead our group through the thick and thin, but in the end you just couldn't get to the ladders fast enough... 









 It's pretty sexy :3 




 I tried to get a real screenshot, but eh it takes pictures of my wallpaper instead. 




 lmao. 




 So I spawned in, found a house and a nice pair of Binoculars, I took them and then.. well these just randomly spawned. I can't pick them up, and they don't look like hatchets and crowbars... 









 How old are you? 




 priceless. 




 Oh god, this is amazing. 




 I'm on -7 time, but I'll play! 




 Anyone? 




 Steam. test_subject7776

 I came here before for them and no one gave, and I read that and came back again. lol :P 




 bold move, motherfucker. 




 Totally. 




 Hey now, what you think is gross i may find delicious. ;D 




 But its not like in Korea where you can't get certain things you want.
I'd rather help someone who needs/wants it.
Then someone who just wants to make a buck. 









 But I want to help someone. 




 I know that they only are sold in South Korea, but I would really love it if someone could send some my way. I live in Arizona and if you need my info message me.

I would be willing to send well, snacks, or anything you might need.
Ex: toiletries and the box of chips like [this](http://i.walmartimages.com/i/p/00/02/84/00/04/0002840004026_500X500.jpg)

So if you live in South Korea and can get them, please, do contact me!

EDIT: Still looking for some. :) 




 Ill do it for some Oreo O's.

Just tell me what you want and I'll try and find it! 




 Fuck you. 




 SOH

 I'll test whenever you want, I'll try and pm you when I get home. 




 I thought it said "hitler potato" so I kept waiting for the potato, and then I went back and say it said "photo", I am not a smart man. 




 I'm impressed. 




 Chandler, Arizona?

Sir, I will probably see you around or have seen you.

 So ass then, eh mate? 




 What a brave ass cat. 









 Annnnnd, My names Travis. Great. 




 I'm numb. It hurts. Oh god.  




 I shouldn't be laughing while fapping.. But her face.. 




 I feel like people don't understand it's an alpha.
I understand that's no excuse, but come on.
It's been out for maybe a week and you're all already bitching. 




 Touch 




 My name is Travis... Do I get a picture? 




 I want to, but then I'll feel like a pedo... 




 I'll say it.

Nice breasts. 




 I know I'm slow :( don't make fun of me. 




 Call me slow, but the Dota 2 "Sniper" has a line that says
"Thanks for standing still, Ganker"
just like the TF2 Sniper has a line that says
"Thanks for standing still, Wanker"

 Bought Legend. 




 Well lately my father has been getting paid less and less as the company he works for might lay off people. So in hopes of keeping his job now, he gets paid 1 week out of the month.
I've played the beta for CS:GO but as it came out, I have had no money to purchase it.
If anyone has a spare they can give me, that'd be amazing. Thank you. 




 Go home reddit, you're drunk. 




 I love to sleep. I'd come home from school and go straight into my bed. I like the warmth the blankets give off, sure it's not like a humans but its better than nothing. I also have cute purple panda stuffed animal who sleeps next to me.
But on Friday, the 28th, it didn't happen this way. I had done something I shouldn't have ever done. I sent a nude to a girl while I'm currently with someone else.
(Note: I did this before in my last relationship and, well you can guess the outcome.) I am the worst when it comes to keeping thing like this a secret. The guilt was eating me so I told my girlfriend what I had done. Needless to say, she was pissed. Now, I've only had depression or at least enough to where it stands out enough to be noticed and medicated, since my last relationship. I should have learned from my mistakes, but hey, I'm a teenager! Since I'm a teenager I jumped from point A to suicide. I'm the type of person who just wants to die all the time, and this whole mess just messed me up. I do already have my own disabilities like ADD and so on. So anyways any moment where my downstairs kitchen room was clear I would run an take some pills. In all I had taken 15 anti depressants, my last 2 ADD pills, and about 25ish+ painkillers. To my surprise I didn't die, I only got some pain in my leg, feeling like a baby was kicking my stomach, and my vision messed up for a while. I do wish I had died. I had found the love of my life, and well.. Messed up. Don't get me wrong my current girlfriend is amazing! But I have this connection with the girl I dated first (We will call her Kat). I just always want to be close to her and protect her. Kat actually wanted me back once but I decided to go out with my current girlfriend (We will call her Hannah). Because Hannah has liked me since gosh knows when, she always cares and asks me things, and also plays games with me. Kat has moved on, and of course, to one of my friends. I know I should get jealous ad or upset over these things, but I can't help it. I should be the one she sleeps with her head on. I do not make the best choices. I mean I usually pick the opposite of what's good for me, and I realize that I really wanted that other choice when it's too late. I've spent sometime searching the house where I live, for the gun we keep. But I can never find it and eventually end up sitting on the nearest bed and crying. I've even tried to over dose on my birthday, my birthday!
I just wish I could sleep for the rest of my life. 
If only my pills worked. They're just too weak to give me happiness.
I'll probably make my own post tomorrow, seeing as I can't get on the computer right the moment, as its 2:45am and I haven't slept in 30ish+ hours.
Good night guys, I hope you all have a lovely sleep, and wake up with a smile. 




 I wish I was a kid again. 




 I wish I was asleep. 




 ~ I don't think I could live being med free. If I still try to kill myself on the meds and with them, I don't want to know how I am off them. 




 Good luck, and have fun!
I like seeing things like this, it's cute and reminds me someone can find love.
Makes me all warm inside. 




 You better have fucking bought it. 




 OH GOD. THANK GOD IT'S COMMON TO HAVE INCEST WET DREAMS. 

I thought I was alone and that it was weird.
Whew, thank you OP for this.

I didn't mean to almost give you an aneurysm. 




 See, I was going to go with a 670, but I wanted the 4gb, and said hey.. 680 is the same price as a 670 4gb. And then 690 doubled fps of a 680.. and yeah.. :P

But thank you aphreshcarrot!

I was thinking of getting a new motherboard, put if it can support this card, I'd rather not spend.

So, do you think these two will work together?

(P.S. I have a Intel i5 2500k CPU @ 3.3 GHz)

Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks! 




 This is my current motherboard

Do I even need to upgrade the processor  motherboard, or will just getting the card work. 














 I'll take a shot. 




 Also, someone said I wouldn't play good, so thats why I asked here! :D 




 Ah, okay! Thank you very much mate :D! 




 Yeah, I just bought it and its not showing up anywhere too, I do have the receipt too!

I just want to make sure I have it... D: 














 I'll gladly trade my wrench for a rocket! 




 I am not in therapy and yeah they do. 
























 Touch sir, touch.

Still dicks in my opinion.
You don't have to play a supportive role, but you shouldn't say "it's undesirable" because saying that to someone who already is on the edge can just push them over. 




 They're dicks. 




 I love you.

 Oh my god, I need to play again, anyone know how to sign up? 




 It does suck indeed. 




 I'm glad I live in AZ so I can use 5% dark just looks good with grabber.

 Simply had a more updated version of core than I needed. Silly me!

Is that how this would work?

'Cause I have no idea where to put these and it's just so confusing. 




 Thank you! I will try it and get back. :) 




 How would I go about adding treecap and connected destruction to my FTB 1.5.2 beta server?

 That's perfectly okay. 




 That's disgusting! 




 I traded in all my stuff, and I'll be playing PC until PS4. 




 Gotta test shit somewhere. 




 Damn, so should I just get a PS3 and play them that way, before the PS4 comes out? 




 So, would PS4 have Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 on it, like in the store? Since I don't want to go buy another system just to play those 2 games.

I know you can't but the disk in, but I'm hoping they would have it available on the store.

Does anyone know? 




 Eh, at least I tried, right?
That's all anyone could of asked for! 




 I'M....TRY...ING.

IS IT... WORKING? 




 Dat ass indeed, brother. Dat ass indeed.. 




 You gon' die.

But in all seriousness, I personally wouldn't sleep and head to the doc, but I am not you, and I have no control over you.
Good luck. 




 It's insane. 




 Plus the Zombie knock down, needs to have a lower chance. 




 Now I don't want to go outside, thanks bro! 




 No one, literally, no one cares.

Also, why are you even stalking him? 




 I hate you so much.... 




 Ah Okay! 




 Thank you. 




 Did your boyfriend beat him to a bloody pulp?

EDIT: Thanks for the Down votes!:D 




 I'm reading that book right now, and that's what I was thinking. :P 




 You're a problem in the world.. 




 Hurts, so much. 




 It doesn't work. There is no point and I hate it. If anything, it makes everything worse.. 




 I helped a girl out of suicide, but when I've needed help, she just ignores me and says that I'm doing it for attention.
It's sad cause I was the only one to give a shit about here and then she turns around and kicks me away.

It's sad, really, really, sad. 




 I think you can get addicted, but that's just me. 




 Happy birthday.

I had my birthday on the 12th, I wish I wasn't here as well. I had gotten out of my second time in a mental/behavioral center for suicide. I even attempted on my birthday in 2012, I just don't care for life. It's boring, and they're making me do out patient shit, which is just large group therapy.

Happy birthday though. Good luck with your life. 




 Idk, torrent maybe? Not on a Computer so I can't say 100% 




 That explains your name. 




 Wow you tried hard.

Okay. Coolio. 




 But yaaaay, you got food!
