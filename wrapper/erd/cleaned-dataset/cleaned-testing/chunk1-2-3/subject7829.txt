 I don't see why approaching mental states as legitimate subjects of inquiry should entail that they are irreducible. 

I would distinguish between mental and inner states. A "mental state" could just be a stage of a process, like a machine state. An "inner state" to me presupposes some sort of qualitative barrier between process and perception.

My whole point in this discussion is basically I don't know how qualia could ever be considered "states" in the "machine state" or "process state" mould, therefore we can't talk about qualia without presupposing a different kind of "state" that is not a stage of a process.

In other words, I am arguing that reductionism rules out qualia and consciousness as legitimate concepts. That doesn't mean I consider reductionism *wrong* (I am up in the air about that), merely that I think those are the inevitable consequences of accepting it.

we already know a lot more than we did 20 years ago about how the brain handles vision, conscious awareness, religious experiences...

I'd agree with the first and last of those, but not the middle one. Explaining the neural correlates of consciousness is not explaining consciousness, unless doing so can "explain away" consciousness as a meaningful idea, a la Dennet's attempt.

I think that consciousness, as well as qualia, must either be null or radically other. I don't see the middle ground like you seem to.

The idea that maybe they [animals] are just automata that happen to behave in a certain way while experiencing nothing is a remote skeptical possibility akin to "what if we're really brains in a vat?" or "what if other humans are really unconscious zombies?"

It's not remote since many believe that we humans are such automata as well. We can at least say that humans have the *concept* of qualia, even if it turns out not to refer to anything. We can't communicate this concept to animals so we have no way of telling what qualitative experience they may or may not have.

On the ethical side, though, I agree with you: In the absence of strong evidence otherwise it is ethical to assume that humans and animals both experience qualia.

Since our qualia seem to be in continual flux, that suggests to me that it must be a process (or more likely, a set of processes).

I think you're confusing change in stimuli with mental processes. They're two different things. I'm saying - how does qualia fluctuate *if the stimuli remains the same*? A point stimuli or a constant stimuli can kick off a whole cascade of processes but it only seems to generate one immediate, constant quale. Red only becomes "less red" when the rods in my eyes saturate (a physical process). The fact that the quale goes away when I look at something else is not the issue.

then some subset of those feedback connections would be projecting into the visual cortex and incorporating that information into the stream of consciousness. 

The problem is, it doesn't appear as a "stream" or a "process," but as a pointlike experience. Obviously a process assembles that experience before it is "presented" to the awareness, but what is it that can apprehend the entire process instantaneously?

Again, it's not enough to say "well, it really doesn't happen instantaneously, we've proven in the lab that there's a lag of 40 milliseconds" or whatever. Why does it *appear* instantaneous? Where does this sense come from? 

Why a major problem [with Blindsight]? To me it just suggests that it's possible to have a visual experience (however degraded) that one is not consciously aware of. 

Because it argues against the *role* consciousness has been assigned in current reductionist theories, which is as *the name we give to the processing of stimuli via mental states.* Here is a complex mental state in response to a stimuli, with *no conscious component*. That's a huge problem in my book.

Reductionists could fall back on the older view of consciousness as a pure epiphenomenon, an "impotent narrator," but that view has been out of fashion for some time and for good reason.

maybe there is crosstalk in the circuits which, while relatively data-poor, allows patients to perform slightly above chance (which is all they find in performance tests).

[This article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7794783.stm) seems to suggest something a good deal more shocking than "performing slightly above chance." Key quote:

"A video recording shows him completing the obstacle course set up by the scientists "flawlessly", without the aid of his cane or another person."

Also he can respond to facial expressions which is one of the most complex tasks of the brain and I doubt it can be explained by weak cross-talk.

You might be interested in the work of Colin McGinn on this subject.

I can only wonder if these pessimists have ever actually opened a neuroscience textbook, because the way they talk, you'd expect neuroscience books to be 2 pages long!

A lot of them are Philosophers of the Mind, so I *hope* they have read neuroscience, though you never know. Anyway the pessimists aren't so much saying "we can never figure out the brain" in the heuristic sense of figuring out what region processes what, as they are saying that the "deep truths" we want to find by studying the brain, such as "is reductionism true?" simply aren't accessible, and perhaps aren't even intelligible concepts.

Note this is different from saying "consciousness isn't an intelligible concept," it is a level of abstraction removed. The pessimists are saying "asking whether or not consciousness is an intelligible concept is not an answerable question."

Going back to McGinn again he is also sympathetic to this idea though I think at heart he's a non-reductionist though he doesn't declare openly for that.

I'm not one of these pessimists myself but the way that very smart people (a lot more educated than I am) continually seem to talk past and misunderstand each other on this subject makes me queasy that they may be right.

 Thanks. Oh, and I forgot to add:

4.) The hope that close attention to the details will allow for a better foundation upon which attacks on the "big problems" can resume in the future. This view holds that the previous attacks failed because of shaky foundations. Bad definitions, muddled logic, etc. 




 I have no idea what you're talking about but there's a number of works on the intersection between mathematics and philosophy.

One category is the philosophical basis of mathematics (Godel's theorem, Cantor, etc.)

But I think what you're interested in is the converse: A possible mathematical basis for philosophy. On that topic Badiou has been recently popular. 




 1.) over-specialization, a desire to "professionalize" philosophy so that it resembles other university disciplines.

2.) lack of progress on the "hard" questions leading to frustration, giving up, lack of funding.

3.) the view that there are no "hard" questions, just illusions of language. 




 The tendency to over-define vague terms and then follow those definitions to their logical conclusions gets philosophers into muddles.

True, and that might be the problem with qualia. 

I fear we're constructing a pantheon of very slippery inner states, and then postulating new mental states to cover up for the holes in our initial description. In this practice, we quickly reach a point where our main limiting factor is our imagination.

That's my fear also.

My worry is not that there aren't any such inner states to describe, but that our description is theory-rich and data-poor, and therefore we may be misdescribing them rather badly.

I hope so, and I hope more data might shed some light on these questions. However, as of now I can't see a way out of the trap. Accepting "inner states" to any degree seems to entail accepting the whole ridiculous pantheon of irreducible and incommensurable qualia. Rejecting "inner states" means discounting phenomenological observation altogether, which seems almost as ridiculous.

Can't we be pretty sure that animals experience pain? They behave like they're in pain, they have neural wiring similar to that which processes pain in humans, similar stimuli seem to cause pain in animals. 

I'm not as confident. We don't know where in the brain qualia are produced, if they even exist (and if they are even produced by the brain, if they exist.) They may be produced only in the prefrontal cortex, which animals don't possess to the same degree. Animals may simply process the stimuli of pain without any accompanying qualia. It's impossible to know, but I also think it's immoral to assume that they don't and that it's ok to hurt animals.

(btw, the fact that almost all moral systems are implicitly based on the existence of qualia is what makes a lot of people so leery about qualophobes, regardless of the evidence.)

This isn't obvious to me. Actually since qualia fluctuate over time, it seems to me that they are almost certainly processes.

How do qualia fluctuate in your view? Do you mean only if the stimuli changes? We would agree there. But not if the stimuli remains the same. They seem to be point-like experiences to me. Sure, a color will fade if you look at it too long because the rods in your eyes get saturated, but that's a different issue.

A desktop computer is a serial processor and will process these in sequence... whereas our brain's architecture is massively parallel, allowing it to perform many computations simultaneously. 

Actually, modern computers are massively parallel as well. I'm not denying that the brain processes imagery in parallel. Obviously it does. What bothers me is that these parallel processes then seem to produce outputs that are presented to our awareness as a unity.

Blindsight shows that visual stimuli response can function independently of any visual experience. This is a major problem for reductionists.

I have a feeling you're going to tell me this doesn't help, but I'm not sure why.

I'm concerned with how we experience a process as a unity, a point-like experience. That's where I see a weakness in the reductionist argument. 

If the non-reductionists can somehow tame the zoo of qualia, I might "go over" to their side. I'm not there yet though. I'm more thinking a third approach might be needed, but I have no idea what that could be. 

I'm also more sympathetic now than I used to be to the epistemological pessimists who think the mind can no more think about itself than a hammer can hammer itself, that our minds are designed to be "turned outwards towards the world" and that too much introspection on mental states inevitably leads to logical knots, simply because we're not designed to process that sort of information.
 




 I'm not too familiar with this position. Is this Dennett's view?

More or less. Though he's too canny to ever say so in such simple terms, in my reading he thinks both qualia and consciousness are "null pointers" - words that don't really refer to anything meaningful. For a while I thought he had the true picture - right down the the competing networks of Darwinian neurons fighting for dopamine - but now I'm not so sure.

higher vs. lower functions...

I would take a Heideggerian approach to this question. Anything "ready to hand" that we can use in a transparent fashion without  rational thinking is a lower function, even if it was set by practicing it as a higher function (for example that choke hold, which had to be puzzled out and learned before it became automatic) Anything "unready to hand" that requires us to activate our reasoning skills is a higher function. 

I'm not sure if I agree with the entailment from propositional attitudes to qualia or not. If I say "I believe that 2+2=4" how would we characterize the corresponding quale?

*Believing* it, as opposed to merely using the fact in a process, would entail the quale of the emotion of belief, the feeling we get when we look at something we know to be true. 2 + 2 = 5 is not just a false statement, it triggers a different quale when we see it (in the qualophile's view.)

we want to know why all this processing is accompanied by "inner feels." Maybe 'qualia' is not the best concept with which to get a handle on the problem, but turning a blind eye to it doesn't seem like a solution.

Exactly.  I agree. However, the reason *why* I agree has to do with the simultaneity of visual perception, which I will try to explain below.

I think a strong case can be made for the existence of qualia in non-linguistic animals (think animal pain, blue dot on the forehead test, food preferences, etc.)

I'm not sure. If you believe in qualia, you believe there's a difference between "seeing blue" the way a computer can (or seeing a face the way Cottrel's network can), and really *seeing blue* (seeing the quale not processing the wavelength.) Since we can't communicate like this with animals, we can't know for certain either way.

Damn. Sorry man, I'm just not understanding why this is a problem.

Ok, I'll be glad to try again. Thanks for sticking with this discussion! 

Reductionist theories of mind run into a problem when they encounter mental phenomena that *don't seem to be processes*. Thought is a process. Emotion, Demasio and others have argued with merit, is a process. Qualia are obviously not processes but the very concept of qualia is shaky. 

But what about visual perception? Phenomenologically, it doesn't seem (and seeming is what's important here, since we're talking about inner states) that I see first the cat, then the lamp, and process these two concepts like a computer program would that could recognize multiple objects in a picture (these do exist.)

Rather, I seem to apprehend both of them *at the same time*. Visual perception appears not to be a process but rather a *pointlike experience* that is nevertheless very rich in data.

It is the nature of visual perception, at once pointlike in time and vast in the amount of stimuli that is perceived, that seems very un-process-like.

If we accept that it is not a process, we should also be more open to the idea that other non-processed mental states like qualia also might exist (where there's one monkey, there's more...). 

I'm starting to suspect that qualia might indeed exist, and only be *mediated* by language, which can open or foreclose access to them depending on the grammar, and not created as an illusion of language, and the reason there's no sharp cutoff between "redness" and "orangeness" is because there's just one color qualia that exists as a continuum.

But this opens a huge can of worms. Qualia must either be null or *radically* Other, beyond all category of thought or understanding. Even a thoroughgoing dualism in the traditional sense seems to leave no room for qualia. You would need an unbounded pluralism of incommensurable experiences, each its own separate ineffable Universe and yet somehow united within our minds. That sounds like the sort of conceptual disaster that usually results from having started from wrong premises.

So I'm still torn on the qualia issue.

Is there a wiki page on this?

I couldn't find anything more specific than stuff on qualia and the Hard Problem. There are some technical articles that talk about the problems of simultaneity and I remember reading about this issue in Penrose and Chalmers (who proposed quantum and dualistic solutions, respectively.) 




 making the most serious attempts to give a legitimate explanation of qualia (as opposed to the defeatists who seem to suggest that qualia are magical and inexplicable).

Or those who think they're just a trick of language?

"Language of thought" folks believe that this is essentially language-like whereas eliminativists of the Churchland variety think that the brain's basic cognitive processes are rather non-language-like

I think both views are simplistic. Our "higher" cognitive functions are obviously language-like in processing, at least in my view, whereas "instinct"-type reactions are not. Habits fall in between the two - that's why they can be so hard to break.

As far as I can tell the questions are entirely independent. 

Why I think the two issues are fundamentally the same is that, as far as I understand the concept, a propositional attitude must have an intentional object. It is hard to see how such an object can be anything other than a quale. 

If there truly are propositional attitudes such as "I would like to have a beer," rather than simple processes that report such sentences as part of their functioning, then the quale for the taste of beer is implied.

I know the eliminationists don't believe in these attitudes, and I thought they didn't believe in quales either, but you say they are merely "reductionist" in relation to quales. I don't quite see the difference because according to the classic definition at least, quales are irreducible. A reduced quale is a non-existent one.

Skeptical in what sense? Skeptical that the term 'qualia' refers to anything at all? 

Yes. For a while I was in the "it's all just a trick of language" school and I still think those arguments have a lot of merit. For example, if there is a quale that embodies "redness," when we see a color shift for example in a computer graphics display, we should notice a sharp cutoff where "redness" changes to "orangeness," but we don't. 

Also, people who speak languages that don't distinguish between "blue" and "green," Japanese for example, have been shown to be able to see less shades in that color range than English-speakers. All this points to quales somehow arising from language and not being fundamental.

Where I've started to doubt that view, however, is in the appearance of the simultaneity of visual perception. Looking at the room right now, I see a lamp, and a cat, *apparently at the same time*, and as distinct objects, not a blob combining the qualities of both (a furry, purring lamp for example.) 

How is this possible? If the mind is a mere process, how does this perception arise? There should only be reaction to visual stimuli, as with the Blindsight phenomenon, but nothing else. Yet something else appears that, unlike color quales, it is quite difficult to explain as a trick of language.

Before you chalk me up as a disciple of the Time Cube guy, the two dimensions of time and String Theory stuff was partly tongue-in-cheek, but this problem seems so vexing I wonder if this or a similarly bizarre explanation will eventually be needed.

What I was referring to is that in String Theory there are "extra" dimensions that are not linear, but rather curled around the three dimensions we know and love. Much like a tightrope walker will perceive a tightrope as one dimension, but an ant will see two (the ant can go forward and backward as well as around the "curled up" dimension that composes the rope itself.), in String Theory at a small scale our Universe has 10 or 11 spatial dimensions, not 3.

What I was proposing was that perhaps time also has a String Theory-like "curled up" dimension and that's how visual perception can be a process yet still somehow seem presented as a unity to the mind.

And of course Roger Penrose is a physicist who became interested in the philosophy of the mind and concluded that quantum physics must somehow be involved, launching an entire industry of bad New Age books misinterpreting his ideas. 




 Thanks for the detailed reply. You're lucky you got to work with some of the most eminent modern philosophers - whether I agree with them or not, that's quite an experience and one I wish I could have had.

So obviously your experience with them is very extensive and I'll take your word for it on what their true views are. However, I am puzzled by a couple of things you said:

believe that neuroscience science will explain qualia.

That is the qualophobic position, if I am correct. "phobic" is just an unfortunate appelation that this position got stuck with. It doesn't literally mean they are *afraid* to address the issue qualia, just that they think qualia can be reduced to neurology without either a dualistic or an emergent order.

they all agree that there is something wrong with folk psychology but they can disagree radically as to what (for the Churchlands, it's propositional attitudes, for others it's qualia or consciousness).

I don't think there's really much of a difference between propositional attitudes and qualia, fundamentally. They both seem to refer to mental states that can't be reduced to mere *processes*, and that's the real issue in my book.

I'm pretty skeptical about qualia myself, both internal and external, but the one phenomenon I don't think has been explained is the simultaneity of distinct objects of visual perception, and that one thread kind of lets everything else in again through the back door. 

It's not enough to say that vision merely *appears* simultaneous, obviously it's not and many studies have proven this (including the infamous "gorilla" experiment), because it's appearances that are the issue. Why should it appear simultaneous? How does this unity, however illusory it might be, manifest? I don't know of any reductionist philosopher who's explained that to my satisfaction.

I have an admittedly crazy theory that there are two dimensions of time, the other one curled up around our familiar dimension like the extra dimensions of String Theory, and that the unity of visual perception is processed in that dimension, using some Penrose-style quantum woo-woo hand-waving, and then somehow "presented" back to the ordinary mind as a unity.

So if you don't think I'm entirely bonkers after hearing that, I'd love to hear any further thoughts you might have on the subject, given that even formidable minds have said what we should do with this issue is just "sweep it aside and hope for the best" 
 




 I think he meant in physics, where three dimensions are privileged (see r3m0t's post), but that's interesting - I never knew that. 




 I don't think any philosopher from Plato on would disagree that "love" is a muddled concept that refers to many different things. 

I do think the Churchlands are far more radical than the rather uncontroversial critique you ascribe to them: In my reading of their position, they think "love" refers to not many different states, but to *nothing* - that the behaviors we ascribe to "love" have *no affective states behind them whatsoever*, any more than there is some being called Zeus behind the phenomenon of thunder.

In essence they are extreme qualophobes - they not only deny external qualia like "red," but internal qualia as well such as emotions. Some see them and the rest of the EM school as the heirs to the Behaviorists, but all the Behaviorists said was that the "black box" of internal states could not be studied scientifically - they never said that internal states didn't exist.

I've by no means read their corpus, so their position may have evolved since my last encounter with their work, but that's how I read their position at the time.

 Before you suggest "Ghost in the Shell," this was NOT Ghost in the Shell, I've seen every movie and episode, and this wasn't it.

What I remember for sure: It was quite similar to Ghost in the Shell. It involved cops in Japan with tank-like robot assistants. The plot was convoluted, but in the end it was revealed the evil mastermind was an old man who lived in a giant dome who was trying to merge trees and robots to create a new form of life. In the end his plot was foiled, but all the tank-robots were destroyed in the process.

 It also doesn't take into account the issue of land-values, on which productivity has no effect.

Productivity does affect land value. For example, after the invention of the elevator and modern building techniques, the value of land in or near a city increased dramatically due to the fact you can fit more people and/or make more products with the same amount of land than you could previously.

Likewise, the Internet and telepresence technology has affected land value, but in the opposite direction (reducing demand)

 There might be a mint there, but only if you can get past the media screaming about "ebonics" or some such nonsense. I can just imagine Limbaugh now: "New fake IQ test racist against whites! Makes blacks seem smart when they're not!"

As other posters mentioned, this is really a non-issue: Murray's own data shows economic status was the determining variable, not race, even if we admit "race" as a coherent, measurable concept, which I and most scientists have serious doubts about anyway. Remember there was a time when Italians and Jews were not considered "white," and now they are. 




 I agree, but that's not the conclusion he drew in the book. 




 He also fails to mention the rise of the war on drugs, and the increasingly large portion of the black male population that is in jail.

He did note that he focused exclusively on whites to avoid "ethnic issues." But the fact that this guy's book is called "The State of White America" raises the creepy level in the room just a bit. If this is the same Charles Murray who wrote "The Bell Curve," which suggested that blacks "naturally" have an IQ level 15 points below whites, it all starts to fit together. He's not worried about blacks because he thinks they're beyond hope anyway. 





























 The Dry Tortugas are indeed in the Caribbean. This is a different island with a similar name. "Tortuga" is Spanish for "turtle." 



















 I would prefer to use the term "strength of effect" when referring to a linear coefficient, and I would prefer that it be used in replacement of or at least along with correlation when reporting how variables are linked. 









 Only in our Galaxy. 




 In terms of pure math, you are correct, but when the general public hears the words "strongly correlated," that's not what they think. It is possible, after all to have some form of cancer be "strongly correlated" with weight, and yet have it that a 160 lb. person has a 2.1% chance of the cancer whereas a 250 lb. person has a 2.2% chance of the cancer. In cases like these unit invariance is irrelevant - reporting such a link as "strongly correlated" is misleading, even though technically accurate. 




 No... part of what it's showing is you get the same correlation value for many different patterns. Even if you just look at linear patterns, you can get the same correlation value with radically different slopes on the best-fit line. Two quantities can have a correlation of close to 1 (which would seem to imply a strong relation) and yet still be only weakly related in reality if the slope of the best-fit line is close to 0.

 Cartoons in general, especially old cartoons. The Macy's balloons really creep me out. 
























 I don't really think you get what I'm trying to say. Read the other posts in this thread, they explain it better than I do.

The point is, 0!=1 is not a "tack on" that has nothing to do with the rest of the definition of a factorial and is just there for convenience so we don't end up dividing by zero. It is implied by the original definition. 




 Then the same can be argued about any mathematical function. It's not a "convention" in the way that placing the dependent variable on the left-hand side of an equation is a "convention."  0!=1 is suggested by the underlying concept itself, not just inherited tradition. 




 It's a convention, not a theorem. It's been chosen like that because it's useful.

No, that is not correct, it is in the structure of the idea of the factorial. Think of a baseball team of x players. There are x! ways for the coach to order them on a bench for photo. Now imagine if the coach simply wanted a picture of the empty bench (0 players.) There is only one way to order that photo. Therefore 0!=1

A similar argument can be made for the "inevitability" of such seemingly "hacky" definitions such as a^0 = 1. 


































 The reaction uses a secret catalyst

Stopped reading right there. Just another Cold Fusion scam and-or self-delusion. 




 I don't think we need any fancy Category Theory to solve this problem as some other posters have suggested.

You merely have to distinguish between declarable and constructable entities. For example, I can *declare* "a square circle" by saying these words, but I could never actually construct one.

Similarly, in Set Theory we can say "The set of all sets," but it is not clear if we mean declarable or constructable sets. The set of all declarable sets includes some sets which trigger Russel's Paradox, and thus are not constructable.

When a mathematician is saying "all sets this, all sets that," he is most likely referring to the set of all *constructable* sets.  




 Why a vow to free beings - or even just one's own being- if there are no beings to free?

Empty of *inherent* selfhood does not mean total emptiness of being, but rather than our selves are unavoidably dependent on the existence of other beings (dependent origination.)

So this is where the vow originates to free all beings - it cannot be any other way, since all being is tied up together. 




 I wasn't going as far back as Smith - just pointing out that Libertarianism was around when any person living today was in High School. 




 True, but if you have to have a graphic metaphor, horseshoe beats grid. Libertarianism, if not the modern Party, has been around quite some time. The grid metaphor got started as the "Nolan Chart." Nolan was a Libertarian. 









 Because as any high school politics student knows, political alignments are not on a line (they're more on a grid, with x and y coordinates, etc.) 

I'm more of a "horseshoe" guy. I think that grid is Libertarian propaganda: "Wow, look, there's a party that believes in *both* types of freedom!" 

Right and left are labels given by American propagandists in the McCarthy era.

No, they come from where the factions sat in the French National Assembly after the Revolution.

His mistake was making his country a socialist dictatorship (communism), rather than a socialist republic.

I don't think he had a choice once he seized power. The majority of the Russian people in 1917 were rural and religious. They would not have voted for Bolshevism if given the chance. A Tolstoy-style religious socialism might have had a better shot. 




 Doesn't matter what they actually do or the fact that social programs are not 'socialism'

Yes, I like how people do not get that social programs are actually a phenomenon of capitalism. There is no welfare in Socialism because everyone is guaranteed a job (and compelled to work.) 

I'm not saying that's a *good* thing, but welfare is Capitalism *preserving* itself from a possible Socialist uprising.

One of Lenin's slogans was "He who does not work, does not eat." Makes him sound like a Tea Party guy, which he was in some strange way, that way the far left and the far right always seem to converge.
 




 Elaborate perhaps? 









 Turkey pasta. Better than it sounds. 




  Politics has always contained a transcendental element (often a phony one used as a lure, but that's a different issue.) In terms of an incentive, few things beat the promise or even the hope of transcendence. 




 "the flawed, selfish nature of man" is a religious percept.

Maybe, but also a Darwinian one. I don't think you can ignore that without socialization to the contrary, human beings care about themselves, their "tribe," and little else. 




 The simple man wonders what's for dinner.

The wise man ponders the mysteries of the cosmos.

The Enlightened man wonders what's for dinner. 




 It was probably similar to those old questions on the SAT about culture-specific stuff that were designed to keep Jews out of Harvard. Taffy is probably something poor Koreans don't see much of. 




 The school system can fail kids without repercussions if needed. The budget isn't set according to how many students graduate. 

This is key. In the US there is tremendous pressure on teachers to pass everyone because funding and ratings are based on "on-time" graduation rates.

 My only disappointment was getting to the bottom and finding out Qu8k isn't for sale (yet...) 





























 Very interesting. Thanks for the response. One thing you said in particular caught my eye:

There are castes among Christians and Muslims too. 

We often read in the Western media that low-caste Hindus and Dalits are converting to Islam or Christianity to escape the caste system. Is that exaggerated or false in your view?
 




 I know some Hindus (and a former one) who would disagree with you. It is true though that there is no central authority in Hinduism, so different groups might have different interpretations. 

By and large though, Hinduism is an inherited tradition. You can't just go sign up to become Hindu like you can for some other religions. The "Western Hindu" groups like the Hare Krishnas and the Rajneeshis are considered fake, heretical or just plain laughable by (most) actual Hindus. 




 Assuming "The West" means the current hegemonic system lead by the United States, I would advise you to beware the "rhetoric of decline" which is used for political manipulation and doesn't really represent the underlying reality. The US is still the world's largest manufacturer, food exporter and its military technology is light-years ahead of anyone else's.

Unfortunately a number of commenters here have bought in to this rhetoric full-scale. For example, one stated:

china and other nations find themselves with a young strong backbone 

China does not have a young, strong backbone. They overshot their population decades ago, experienced apocalyptic levels of starvation several times, and are still paying the price. Their demographics are completely upside down now and the very old will soon outnumber those of working age.

I wouldn't be surprised if the US, Latin America and India form the power troika of 40 years hence while China, Japan and Europe all suffer greatly just from demographic pressure alone. 

The US will probably no longer be the lone superpower c. 2050 but it's quite possible it will still be one of the top dogs.  




 American Indians can be Hindus too if they want

Not Orthodox. You have to be born in the caste system to be considered Hindu. They could always be Hare Krishnas or something though. 



















 I suspected it might be something like this. However, would it be possible to create substances that are *digestible*, but, for whatever reason, don't give any energy to the body and/or cannot be stored as fat? Or would that create metabolic havoc? 














 Aren't sugars carbohydrates? 



















 ...and actually went batshit crazy. she got obsessed with "decoding the codes within the bible."

Are you sure she just wasn't watching the History Channel?

she ended up naked in the parking lot of Lambeau Field with permanent marker and things like Jesus = Mary = Joesph equations solved in unintelligable math

Ok, maybe not.
 




 The government of Zimbabwe is pretty powerful, at least internally. Just ask all their political prisoners and dispossessed farmers. 




 If relatively harmless drugs like marijuana were legal, people wouldn't do this synthetic stuff. It should be banned, but then, pot should be legal as well. 




 That's my point though. Habitual drug users with no history of violence all of a sudden go nuts when they use this stuff. It might be close chemically to THC but in terms of reaction it's more like PCP. It's a drug that is a danger to the public, not just to its users. 




 [Here is one story](http://www.wwaytv3.com/2011/09/01/one-dead-another-custody-after-overnight-shooting-rocky-point). You can find plenty more searching police registers and medical journals. 

There was a case in a town near ours of a guy high on "bath salts" who tunneled into his neighbor's basement trying to kill him because he thought the guy was having sex with his wife. He had been a longtime marijuana user with no criminal record beyond possession and no history of mental illness.

Part of the problem with "bath salts" is they can be many different chemicals - you don't know what you're getting. I agree with a previous poster who said if marijuana was legal none of this would be happening, because most often this stuff is advertized as "legal pot" and sold in skate shops, head shops, etc. which pot users frequent. 




 He argues that a gold standard would force the government back into the price-fixing business. Not sure that's correct, but an interesting perspective. 




 Do you know anyone who's done this stuff? I'm fine with people using drugs that kill them, not so fine with them using drugs that cause them to go nuts and kill other people.  




 This stuff is bad news. Lifelong potheads have tried it once and ended up in the loony bin. For once I don't have a problem with the DEA. 









 don' think human nature is very malleable (which is the most basic idea of any kind of socialism: that people are programmed by relations and circumstances)

Good post, but I'd disagree with you there. Many Socialists believe there is a basic unchangeable human nature, for example Marx's idea of "primitive Communism" representing the original state of Man that will eventually reappear in the final state.

In this view Capitalism is the temporary, un-natural aberration which is part of the reason why it will collapse. 














 I paid $8.50 for a birthday card at Hallmark. 99 cent store will be getting my greeting card business in the future. 




 True, but you can often counter-sue for damages that include your legal fees. I don't know how often that succeeds though. 









 Thanks, but it doesn't appear to be on the soundtrack. It was just background music to a few of the fights - the chanting might not have even been part of the "official" music track at all, I just really dug the combination. 









 Yeah, not quite what I had in mind, but thanks. 




 I heard such music in the background of a show (Soul Eater) and can't get the idea out of my head. Can't track down the artist though.  




 Ah, it looks like only the first two parts are posted with more to come tomorrow. Sorry guys. I liked the first two parts so much I posted before I realized that was all there was. 





























 It has not been established that the original speakers of IE are related genetically to the majority of today's speakers. The language is thought to have spread more from prestige influence and trade than military conquest, except in its earliest spread into the Danube Valley, where there is evidence of warfare.

So it's not like "some black people speak French" and more like "most people who speak French are unrelated to the original French nation, which we know very little about anyway since it ceased to exist 5000 years ago." 




 I don't think you can conflate "Aryan" and "white." The original people who used the word "Arya" probably were lighter-skinned, since they were from the steppes of Russia, but there are non-IE-speaking people who have light skin also, such as the Finns and Hungarians, and many darker-skinned people who speak IE languages and practice a descendant of the "Aryan" religion (most Hindus, for example.) IE is a language group, not a race. 









 "Arya" was a word in certain branches of Satem Indo-European that meant "priest," "aristocrat," or "practitioner of the correct religion or correct rituals" depending on the context. It was not used to mean "tribe" or "race." 

It is much more correct to speak of an Aryan religion that is the ancestor of both Vedic Hinduism and Zoroastrianism than an Aryan race.
 




 Cash did claim God gave him that song in a dream when he was high on Quaaludes, for what it's worth. 




 Yes, but depth like this is why people like it. 














 Here in Michigan the private schools pay for their own buses, textbooks, etc...

Are you sure? I thought that was true in my state as well until a state senator told me otherwise. I was pretty shocked that my taxes pay to bus, heat and equip religious schools.

Have coaches teach gym class. 

They usually do, but they get a separate salary for coaching, at least in most districts in my area.

Require any part of the uniform that isn't customized to be returned at the end of the year (specifically, pants).

Haha, do you know what football uniforms look like by the end of the season? Usually there are multiple uniforms per player for each season because they rip and wear out.

private schools either learn to manage their finances REALLY well, or they disappear because they can't pay the bills.

Or they get the public to foot the bill for them, without any public oversight or standardized test "accountability" that public schools have to follow. Where I live, even some public schools are run by for-profit companies and are exempt from most state regulations, including the obligation to educate special-needs and learning-disabled students. It's sick. 




  How did these right winger Italians get to be so racist? You'd be hard pressed to find a more motley assortment of racial mixing than within the Italian peninsula. 

You've answered your own question. Racial identity anxiety is known to be linked with increased racism. See the American South with its rampant underground "miscegenation" during the pre-Civil War period for another example.

Niall Ferguson covers this issue in [The War of the World](http://www.amazon.com/War-World-Twentieth-Century-Conflict-Descent/dp/1594201005) - the book can be a bit dry but the section on racial anxiety is well worth reading. 




 Prior to the Putsch, as I understand it, the Nazis were a legal party from 1925 onwards TO the Putsch.

The Beer Hall Putsch was in 1923, you've got it backwards. They were briefly banned (and Hitler was jailed under cushy conditions), but legalized again in 1925. 









 At least in my state, joining the union is voluntary. That may not be true everywhere. 




 Actually, public districts are required by law (at least in my state) to bus private students as well, and even pay for the textbooks and heating costs of private schools (except for religious textbooks.)

Sports cost more than you think - coaches are paid in most districts, uniforms, league fees and transportation are expensive, as is insurance, and "the field" in sports-crazy towns is often more like a minor-league stadium. Then there's the marching band - I know for a fact a large district near me has a marching band budget of nearly $100,000 per year.

Disputes over grades and discipline should be handled by the teacher and the student's family, and maybe the school authorities if necessary. When it comes to grade disputes, parents should be required to provide evidence that their student did not earn the grade received or that the assignment was graded unfairly.

Here I agree with you, but that's not the reality of how things work these days.
 




 Salaries of union officials come from union dues, not district budgets. 









 You're probably right about the present time, there is more violent indoctrination among Muslims. However, most Muslims - ever very conservative ones - specifically forbid attacks on civilians, Muslims or not, and if you've seen movies like "Jesus Camp" you will know that Christians have "madrassas" of their own. 









 Only if you restrict your time frame considerably. Over the long frame of history I'd say both religions are equally bloodthirsty. 




 He is an [Obscurantist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscurantist#Restricting_knowledge) - he doesn't personally believe in the religion, but he thinks it is necessary for social cohesion.

Of course the media won't use that term... it's too, well, obscure. 




 Don't forget: They can expel disruptive students. Public schools cannot (unless they have committed an actual crime, like dealing drugs or assault, and even then sometimes they are only kicked out for 6 months or a year.) 




 A lot of times, the administrators are the Creationists. That's the small-town reality. 




 I'm all for paying teachers more, but where the hell is all that money going?

Administration, sports, legal costs (districts are sued constantly when they dare to actually fail or discipline kids), busing costs (no public transportation in most areas means districts maintain huge bus fleets of their own), physical plant (there are a lot of $100M-plus HS buildings in the US with terrible academics). 




 Save money and hire an inexpensive recent grad. Look good to the school board and the negative affects aren't seen until you've hopped to a different job. This BS goes on all the time in Nursing as well which is why unions are popular in both professions. 




 Those sorts of salaries are extremely unusual for public education. They do exist in some very wealthy districts, though. 




 Yep. Given the attitudes towards education in the US, without unions teachers would be earning close to minimum wage, and the jobs would be filled without regard to qualifications or knowledge at all, and would require a political connection to get.

(This all describes how most teaching jobs were actually filled in the early 60's and before, before the union movement really got started.) 




 Yeah, I get that sensory "vagueness" also, except with visuals which are very clear. 




 I was surprised to read that there is no smell or taste in dreams because that part of the brain is shut off during REM sleep. But come to think of it, I've never experienced smell or taste in a dream.

If this is legit, it could be a very effective way to check to see if you're dreaming. So my question is - has anyone experienced smell or taste in dreams?

I'm headed to bed to test the theory myself...

**UPDATE:** Didn't work. I ate a whole box of chocolates, and I thought I was tasting them, although, upon awakening, I couldn't recall the taste. So, maybe there is no taste in dreams, but if you *think* you're tasting anyway, it's useless as a reality check. 









 The Ice Age was over 10,000 years ago. It did not end in the Middle Ages. 









 I read somewhere you would only need 50 digits of pi to compute the circumference of a circle to the nearest millimeter when it had a radius as big as the Universe, but I don't know whether or not that's true. 




 Also, I've always been curious if there is a similar series definition for pi. Wikipedia was not much help on either subject.

 "The History of Rome" podcast is currently about 60 hours overall. The amount of work people put into these things for almost no reward other than the love of history is mind-boggling. 





























 If Time managed to out the Smurfs as secret CommieNazis, I can't *wait* to see the dirt they have on He-Man... 




 I came here to ask "how many years until it's all reality shows?" I think yours is a good estimate. 




 I'm skeptical that the Business Plot was real. Why would a bunch of right-wing businessmen approach an outspoken formal General who had already written a book called "War is a Racket" and had pacifist views to front their coup?

Either they had the worst research in the history of coups or Butler made the whole thing up for publicity. 




 Actually the people who made the TEC-9 are out of business because of such lawsuits, so it has worked at least once. 
























 I believe they want government *inflation* targets, but not actual deflation. Not an economist either. 




 1933 for domestic drawers, 1971 for international (sovereign) drawers. It's complicated. 




 no one would suggest that the bartender who sold them the alcohol is the one responsible for the death.

Actually where I live, bartenders are legally responsible, so most bars take your keys at the door and you have to breathalyze before you get them back. We have among the lowest rate of alcohol-related driving injuries in the country, so it seems to work. 




 I do agree that there would be far fewer deaths if it could be sold on the open market.

Yes, but no one would want to sell it, because there still would be deaths, and the companies that made it would be sued out of existence unless they were given Congressional Immunity like the vaccine makers.

Then you'd just be back to your shady unreliable local "entrepreneur" just like now. 




 Absolutely correct, I was just demonstrating that probabilities can be calculated over infinite quantities.  




 If there are an infinite number of both, there is no way to start the argument

Sure there is - you can do probabilities over infinite quantities. For example, in almost all randomly chosen intervals on the set of natural numbers (which is infinite), you are more likely to pick a composite than a prime number, for example. 




 Not exclusively, though Marx did use it, and it is a term exclusive to the Left as far as I know (the Right would deny the very existence of rentiers.) 




 Thanks, this is the best explanation so far. I have another question for you: Is the Uncertainty Principle a *universal* principle of any conceivable universe, that is, is it a mathematical necessity? Or, are "Newtonian" Universes mathematically possible, but it just so happens that we don't live in one?

I asked this question on reddit before but no one seemed to have a good answer. 




 Actually, it only works if there *are* infinite universes, the way I understand it.  




 I've seen that before, but his definition of "nothing" was also "quantum foam," whatever that is. Not exactly "nothing" in the philosophical sense. 




 Is there a difference though between "quantum fluctuations" - which would seem to imply a pre-existing set of laws - and actual nothingness? Because Hawking clearly states "out of nothing." 




 There's good reason to think not. For example the ["Boltzmann's Brain"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain) argument. 



















 There were rumors about where Brokmeyer had gone; it was said he was conducting a Hegel-focused kindergarten class for the Creek Indians in the wilds of the Oklahoma territory. He assured his friends he was still alive by sending intricately whittled walking sticks to their St. Louis addresses.
