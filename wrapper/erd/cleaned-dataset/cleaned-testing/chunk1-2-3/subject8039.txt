 I have the Hogwarts crest, Always, and the dark mark  




 I have tattoos. Like three so far. And more on the way. That's how I rep the wizarding world!!!  




 Maybe post a link to it? I can't find it.... 




 Why is r/Hogwarts private?  




 I was just wondering if there was a sub reddit for Hogwarts.  




 In the audiobooks, it's pronounced Voldemore. In the paper books and movies, it's Voldemort. Someone help?  




 Not true, they die in the reverse order.  




 I actually started at 24mgs because that's the amount a real cigarette has. It's actually better than the patch in my opinion because you still have the hand to mouth, which is what did me in so many times. The hand to mouth habit is the true killer in smoking, and vaping really helps with that. The patch won't satisfy that feeling, so you're more likely to go back to smoking.  




 One nice thing about vaping is that you can progress down!! I'm currently on zero nicotine, but I like the flavour I use. So I continue to do it anyways.  




 So I don't know how to post how long it's been for me, but it's been over a year now. The e cigarette is a joke. I tried one for a while, and I fucking hated it. What you want to do is go to the nearest vape shop. Look it up, google can tell you where it is. Go in and tell them your story. They will help you out. I have a regular shop I go to, and they are some of the nicest, most supportive people I've met (besides my girlfriend of course.) 

Keep it up!! You can do it!! 
























 I'm willing to bet JKR realised that her faithful fandom would bring this point up, though. Hence the reason that Harry became a horcrux.  




 I feel as though the Room of Requirement was a perfect place. In plain sight, however, for close to 50 years he was the only one who knew what it looked like. Incredibly smart in my opinion.  




 He used the blood of a foe (that for being Harry Potter, his 7th and final Horcrux) 




 Bacon, coffee, clean hair, and beer 




 In my opinion, reboots are inevitable. It's gonna happen. My only hope is that the reboots do these movies justice. Otherwise, I don't wanna live on this planet anymore.  




 I'm with you. Never read a single comic. But I love the movies. Like no other.  




 You and I not only have something in common, then, but would also be excellent friends.  




 Cloak and wand. 

The only people I know who have passed, are at peace. I don't want to disturb their peace. They are waiting for me on the other side of the Veil. 

The cloak and wand, they just seem like the logical choices.  




 Ah yes. Some of those plot lines were missing. However, I still believe it was the best. The final movie haas too many disappointments for me.  




 What issue did you have with the third movie? I thought it was the best done of the series.  
























 I don't think I ever noticed that!! You, dear potter head, are awesome!!!  




 And I would be honoured to be among those numbers alongside good brothers and sisters  




 Oh yes. It's real to us.  




 So I'm rereading the fourth book for the 400th time. And I'm at the graveyard with Harry. And I noticed something. One of the trees mentioned is a yew tree. And voldemorts' wand is made of yew. Thought it was an interesting little tidbit!!  




 Welcome home, friend!! 




 I like this idea. This one seems like the most likely to me.  




 Is anyone else curious as to how a howler doesn't explode en route? Like, what kind of magic is used for that? What if a howler had to be sent to somewhere like Bulgaria from England? Just thought of this!!  




 Not all the trials are present before getting to the sorcerers stone.  




 And this is what I was trying to point out :) thank you.  




 Think about it. JKR says that the process for making a Horcrux is difficult and time consuming. If we hold this to truth, then how was Harry "accidental"? Voldie would've had to have had this planned out, correct? Share your thoughts!!
