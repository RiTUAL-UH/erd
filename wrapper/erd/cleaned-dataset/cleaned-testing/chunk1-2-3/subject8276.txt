 yes but those movies are shit  




 also has the same actor on there  




 The Walrus fight from Tusk  




 that was probably the most shocking thing I have ever seen in a theater oh man those screams tho and the brief glimpses before we were given our first look.  




 Oh well your loss  




 Yeah its more comedy than horror but there are some truely terrifying and creepy moments.  




 Yeah even when they showed the little glimpses and his horrible screaming I was like WTFFF.  




 Yeah I noticed the fake CGI right away and just thought it was someones cool new video but then they said it was supposed to be real so I was like oh.  




 Holy hell how did I not notice that!!!!!  




 LOL  




 HAHA they make a joke about that in the film  




 AMEN  




 See it in the film itself the buildup and reveal is so messed up I cringed when I first saw it.  




 Hes not TOO obvious tho most people might recognize his voice and eyes but thats it. He was freakin hilarious in it LOL  




 Just saw it wow WTF was that LOL so funny and terrifying at the same time I LOVED it cant wait to see it again!!!!! That walrus was scary looking LOL and Johnny Depp oh man was he great in this!!!!!  




 OMG yes I cringed when I first saw it and I rarely do that with movies.  




 Then watch it and have it explained for you  




 Because they r awesome!!!!!!!  




 LOVE that scene!!!!!  




 WOW I did not know that.  




 Thats what caused me to start the thread LOL  




 What are some movies that are an actors last film appearance ever and in their last scene they die in it??  




 Boring, artsy, and not enough Hulk.  




 sounds cool.  




 Avatar  




 Looks pretty good cant wait to see it also hope it gets some award recognition.  




 she didnt want to reprise a role that she earned a razzie for LOL.  




 Yeah she would have been apart of one of the biggest grossing movies ever. She chose to do mad whatever tho.  




 It was a good movie I kinda got confused at some parts but I loved tom and james performance RIP BTW. It was a good crime drama.  




 GOD YES THIS BETTER BE TRUE!!!!!!!!!  




 What is the origin of this term??  




 Just keep reminding yourself that it is NOT real just a movie with actors and a director.  




 Memento the first time I saw that movie I was blown away now everytime I rewatch it while still good it lacks the shock factor or whatever.  




 Not a good way to phrase it LOL but if she likes those kind of movies than why not!!!!  




 Hellboy 3  




 Yeah thats what I was thinking it would explain a lot.  




 Interesting theory how have I not noticed this yet.  




 They should just have a renner damon teamup movie.  




 Ah man I was gonna say that one, but yeah thats true.  




 Daniel day Lewis in Lincoln to me that was just WOW how he recited all of those monologues and stories while still doing a perfect lincoln accent so awesome.  




 Yeah but most of it is based on other unknown facts that I am not familiar with like if it bombs he will have lost a lot of money.  




 maybe  




 Yeah thats what I was thinking I also read somewhere that frank the rabbit was sent by some invisible gods or something to fix the timeline.  




 I Am Legend  




 now that is a good one I remember downloading the script and reading some of it it was genius. Too bad it will likely never be made be nice to see stallone behind the camera only and to see him do a pure drama biopic.  




 I love that movie!!!!  




 Yeah thats what I think too so a brooklyn accent.  




 I always wanted to use one of those but I never did.  




 Like what are some things that seem perfect for someone but will likely never happen because of one person being a jerk ie Steven Seagal is perfect for the expendables franchise but will never appear because of his beef with avi lerner.  




 I cannot stand hardcore girlie movies like the sisterhood of the pants or the yaya sisterhood. Also directtodvd kids movies. Anything else tho I generally like oh yeah except crappy b movies like the ones steven seagal does nowadays.  




 Yeah I love that movie I remember how scared I was when I first saw it.  




 Yes  




 Dam she has an oscar I forgot and she hasnt put it to good use yet either.  




 Ig u havent seen Ghostbusters then it would be an amazing experience to watch it in the theater brand new!!!!  




 Its all about the benjamins for him, it is really sad cuz I think he does great in drama and he should do it more but all he does is shitty comedies all the time.  




 Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln in the movie Lincoln also Heath Ledger in the Dark Knight.  




 I would feel like a horrible person. 




 yeah that one  




 that movie that Marion Cotillard won an oscar for.  




 that one doesnt count cuz the thread is about heroes and villains who only meet once.  




 good one  




 Yeah that POS was released in theaters.  




 Man i wish that had a sequel just to see Sinestro as a villain anyways.  




 Yeah I love snowpiercer and why did I just realize that one?? Interesting.  




 Movies where the hero or protagonist only meets the villain once in the entire film.  




 Who would be cool in a film version of the book carte blanche?? Just for fun.  




 What are some perfect film collaborations that never happened??  




 UGG I HATE it when he drinks, it is SOOOO annoying!!!!!!  




 Like I will move either my leg or arms for something and they will make a creek sound, kinda like a floorboard. Why does it do that??  




 My BMI is 31 and I weigh 244 Lbs I want to get my BMI down to a healthy weight which is 184 so I want to lose 60 pounds at least. How can I do this without getting dangerous I dont care about the time either.  




 like regular actors who donet usually do comedy but r actually very good at it, like van damme on welcome to the jungle.  




 Go the hell to bed now!!!!! You have literally been sitting there for 13 freakin hours!!!! Give someone else a shot on the tv now!!!!  




 When you are expected to do something do it!!!!!! Dont just blow it off and ruin someone elses whole day do what is expected of you and also get off the dam couch for at least 30 minutes!!!!! God I HATE people who do that!!!!!  




 I sleep 8 or 9 hours a night band I am 22 years old but why do I yawn all day everyday??? Is there something else?? I wont feel tired at all but I still yawn.  









 I just mean actors not actresses because we all know what they did to get famous LOL, Like just guys who have no acting skills or anything but still get roles for no reason.  




 Its my soda god damit go get your own!!!!!! I only have a little and it is for ME noone else!!!!! Jesus christ if it was yours I would have said it is mine and yours, I dont care if you raised me it is MINE.  




 UGH I HATE when people randomly drink my god dam soda like they dont even care!!!!! I am on a budget and I cant afford to keep buying them damit if it isnt yours dont touch it!!!!!!  




 So I live with my dad and me and him were never really close I am more close to my mom and sister but I live with him because he lives close to where i work and I dont have enough money to get my own place yet. Anyways it is a one bedroom apartment and he sleeps in a bed and I sleep on an old military cot we both take turns on the tv and stuff but sometimes I wish I just had my own space!!!!! He is also kind of an ass sometimes, earlier today he assumed I was gonna go stay with my mom and sister for the weekend and I didnt correct him, then when he got home that evening he said "I thought u were gonna go with them" Then I responded " I never said that" He responds with "yes you did" UGH I HATE when people put words in my mouth that is one of my pet peeves!!!!! GOD I need my own place again!!!!! When I leave I will never call or visit him again that is the truth.  




 I have always wondered how do they know which bullets came out of what kind of gun???  




 I mean something along the lines of Daniel Day Lewis when he played Bill The Butcher who hated Abe Lincoln but eventually went on to play him, stuff like that.  




 I recently realized that I have crooked ears by almost a thumbs width. Why did this happen to me??  




 Whenever I hear the term inflation like for how much a movie has grossed and stuff I always wonder what it is???  




 Wat r some good ones where someone is first billed but they have very little screentime??? 




 I remember watching an episode of johnny bravo where he finds something and there is the sound of a choir and you think it is in his head but it actually was a choir singing behind him and he tells them to cut it out cuz that is annoying. Anyone know which episode that is???  




 A long time ago I remember watching this movie with my parents about a group or guys who defend a fort or something in the middle of the desert there was the main guy who may or may not have been played b Jean Claude Van Damme. There was also a black guy who gets captured by the enemy and a guy who gets an eyepatch over the course of the movie. At the end of the major battle it is just the main guy and the eypatch guy left, that is all I remember. Anyone know???  




 Like do u always get snacks if so what?? Also is there a favorite place u like to sit in the theater??? For me I always get snacks usually just popcorn and a drink but for longer movies I get candy too which I usually sneak in LOL. I also like to sit in the middle of the theater that way I dont have to crane my head.  




 What kind of film career would he have had?? God I wish he had lived I assume he would have been in The Expendables at some point.  




 I have always wondered what does having a mortgage mean???  




 What are some uncredited roles that are more than a cameo I mean a full fledged supporting role that was never credited for some reason.  




 Also what do u feel when u get scared, or startled??  




 Basically she is a few years younger than me and we used to go to the same high school and we r facebook friends and I really want to ask her out, but I dont know how I never see her around town and I dont want to ask over FB that sounds lame, I did look her up in the phonebook and I know her address and home phone number but I dont want to use those as it would be too stalkerish. What should I do???  









 What are some good ones???  




 I know an author gets an advance or something with a publisher but exactly how does this work??  









 I remember seeing a foreign commercial with all of the horror icons and stuff just outside doing normal things. Like Freddy Krueger, Michael, and Jason although I forgot what they were doing but I do remember Chucky was on a pogo stick bouncing around. It was all in live action.  




 I am considering reading 2 hp books at the same time. I am reading HBP but I also want to read GOF. I am just wondering if I should or not. Has anyone ever done this before?? LOL 




 I am just curious what other actors would u guys have seen in other roles. I for one think Bob Hoskins would have made a fine Horace SLughorn. Any other ideas??  




 A long time ago I watched the ending of a movie which had Men in Black as villains, I mean they were also aliens but they had big alien eyes that they would hide with sunglasses and they had white blood I believe. I also remember a bunch of the men in black attacked a house at night and tried to kill people.  




 Im sure this has been asked for but what if Tim Burton and Michael Keaton had returned for Batman 3 I think it would have been pretty amazing actually. I liked the first 2 and It is sad that they only made 2, thoughts???  




 A few years ago I walked in on my friend watching netflix and he was watching some movie that I have no idea was but it seemed intriguing. It was the very end of the movie and a prisoner got a letter in a jail cell and as he read the letter with a voiceover of the kid who wrote the letter, he was poisoned or something and the guy just dies there in his cell with some kind of poison that was on the letter I believe.  




 When I was younger I used to watch this anime show about some guy named Tenchi I believe he lived in the forest with a bunch of girls and one of them was nemed reoko or something like that. I remember he would fight people with a sword too.  




 To me some of the worst movie lines ever have to be on Taken 2 "look a flip flop" or "I just shot some guy". Another one was After Earth "my suit is black I like it but I dont know what it means". What are some others???  




 title  




 Like a relative or something.  




 Like a movie where there is no actually villain or antagonist for the heroes to fight it is just them against the clock or something like Inception.  




 I know there is Nicky in The Bourne Ultimatum and Angel in XMen First Class but r there any other ones where there is a character who doesnt talk after like halfway into the movie??  









 Like when a british person is playing an american and in the movie they "pretend" to be british and then revert to their real life accent. Any other country would work too like Australian, or Irish or german.  




 Every time I try to use Hola unblocker to watch netflix it takes me to the page but it never fully loads. Does this happen to anyone else?? Also what is another program that does the same thing as Hola???   
























 Hes retired  




 It was a movie about a guy who lost his family in a car crash and the girl who killed them a drama story basically, it could have been its own movie without the Other Earth storyline.  




 Yeah I mean it was a good movie I liked it but just seems like a huge wasted opportunity.  




 Yeah the first one was stupid but I did like the AVP fight scene thats about it. The second was a little better but not that much.  




 Another Earth  




 Its pretty good cant wait to see what the rest of the season brings!!!!!!  




 Yeah she is now the new Jennifer Lawrence and Shailene Woodley.  




 She was a little underrated before both this and Jack Reacher made her a little bigger. Hopefully she gets some well deserved recognition for this one!!! Might I also mention that she was very sexy in GG too.  




 Yes she was really good in it I am hoping this movie raises her profile more.  




 I dont think neither won its left deliberately ambiguis.  




 I watched a trailer for this movie with Haley Joel Osment called Home of the Giants and it literally gave away the entire movie. I felt bad now after watching the trailer first from that point on I never do that.  




 Maybe  




 I liked it, it was Homeland I like how they have a new start with new storylines and stuff. Just what this show needs.  




 Whenever I have an argument or someone has wronged me I usually imagine myself getting revenge on the person often in horrific ways. Example I was fired a few months ago and the boss was so unforgiving about it he is an ass and sometimes I imagine myself returning to work there and taking him out. the same with my dad I dont like him that mush and I imagine making him pay. Just thought I would put that to writing.  




 I also remember a movie with Robert Redford and Willem dafoe called The clearing that is rated R for literally 1 F bomb.  




 As well as some graphic nudity.  




 I Love You Phillip Morris.  




 Lost in Translation is rated R for one brief scene of nudity but I have seen other pg13 movies with more nudity than that that didnt get R.  




 jax doesnt know that he was high when he said it plus he doesnt really have a good track record with the club.  




 I wish he had killed Lin and all of his guys that way he can be done with this pointless vendetta.  




 thats what I was thinking and I hope that that happens.  




 Me too what scares me the most about that is that it can actually happen that thought just gives me the shivers.   




 I just used my fist to break my fall that was it.  




 Just leave dude dont let your life get any worse.  




 Yeah true.  




 Its entertaining, thats about it.  




 I dot have a job ATM so whenever I somehow scrape together some cash and I am a little short I go into my dads room and grab a few quarters. Over the past year it must have equaled 20 dollars. I kinda feel bad but not really cuz he is an asshole.  




 Jesus FUCKING CHRIST!!!!!!! I didnt mean to hit you it was an accident I tripped and hit you on the back with my fist it was a complete accident you did not need to act like i actually hit you for no reason because I didnt!!!!! And you made me look like a fool in front of my fucking MOTHER!!!!!!! You are a piece of shit I always hated you!!!!!! You dont know what an accident is or use common sense like I was trying to explain to you, you just started yelling at me for no fucking reason!!!!! You are a piece of shit and I officially hate you now.  




 Mike Myers - The Love guru  




 Charlie Wilson is indirectly responsible for 9/11.  




 it took WAY to long to come out and it just wasnt as good as its predecessor.  




 Yes  




 Never seen it.  




 Good one  




 What are some good ones???  




 Best Actress fo sho if she gets a nom tho.  




 Yes she probably went to China for a few years in the universe anyways.  




 I used to get Abbie Cornish and Katherine Heigl confused 
 




 Christopher Meloni and Elias Koteas  




 YES!!!!!!!!!!!  




 Also because of all the nudity and stuff plus I thought anything Gay related automatically got an R Rating.  




 Joe Dirts dad  




 I always wondered why Chuck and Larry is Rated PG13 it seems R Rated to me.  




 LOVED it it was an exact adaptation of the book also loved the performances especially Rosamund Pike she was so DAM SEXY in that movie!!!!!!  




 Yes he is a good actor and one of my favorites I wish he would become an A Lister again. He just needs the right role I guess.  




 Exactly.  




 I didnt like it at all I wish at least one of them died or something. Cant wait to see the movie tho!!!!!  




 Fina-Freakin-LY  




 Bale  




 let the Harry Potter jokes begin!!!!!  




 Breaking Bad  




 They r all about the same but my personal favorite out of the 3 is Phoenix he is so good in all of his roles.  




 Tusk and I want my mind erased of everything I knew about the movie beforehand too so I could watch it blind.  




 yes I will.  




 LOVED IT!!!!! A bit disturbing at some parts but still funny and weird all at the same time.  




 Yes  




 halloween the original.  




 Interesting  




 Yeah I am, almost done with the book just like 80 pages left and stuff.  




 K I got some reading to do then but first i have to finish Gone Girl in time for Friday LOL.  




 Oh alright im gonna keep going I think I heard Brans storyline doesnt add up in the books and tv show anyways.  




 Yes thats why they became decepticons they r basically Megatrons Children.  




 Alright cool I will keep reading then, its just so long and I already know whats gonna happen.  




 BOOOOOOOOOOOO  




 I am currently reading the Game of Thrones books and I am on book 2 a clash of kings but I am wondering if I should just skip ahead to book 4 because I have already seen the tv show and know what happens. what should I do??  




 I liked it a very realistic revenge film and well made to for a debut film.  




 cool  




 Gemmas secret not getting out.  




 Yeah I like seeing them at church now it doesnt really happen that much.  




 Wolverine 3 will come out a year later I believe.  




 All  




 Star Wars  




 Yes would love to see more of Davids adventures and what villains he would encounter.  




 Yeah he is a good actor wish he was in more movies that would challenge him tho instead of just playing Bruce Willis all the time.  




 Mostly cuz he is a part of a worldwide Cult but aside from that I like him he is a good actor and I have only seen him in a few bad movies.  




 Good  




 Did u miss Mel Gibson???  




 The Cabin in the Woods I thought it was gonna be another horror movie where everyone dies but I was pleasantly surprised now it is one of my favorite movies.  




 Furry Vengeance happened.  




 Why is there a picture of Godzilla???  




 i am a student studying something else now and i am currently looking for a new job.  




 I went to film school for a year and a half.  




 I agree with everything u just typed I hope Dumb to will bring his career back and that he will become a leading man again it has been forever and yeah I dont think I will ever watch Mr Poppers Peguins even if he is in it. He is like my all time favorite actor.  




 Jim Carrey  




 Finally some good news about this project.  




 Yeah Jax will probably fuck him over and stab him in the back like he does to everyone.  




 Yeah Jax will probably fuck him over and stab him in the back like he does to everyone.  




 Oh yeah thats what I like.  




 It is awesome nothing can stop it now!!!! I am glad AOS is here that way I can get my weekly dose.  




 It could go either way I wouldnt mind seeing Marks be a badass again and actually killing someone.  




 So the club is now going to kill at least 3 people every episode now?? AWESOME!!!!!   




 Yes loved that part its good to see Marks threatening people again instead of being all goody goody.  




 Not really movie news plus that is Colin Farrell  




 Cant wait for the trailer!!!!  




 Not at all  




 Oh yes and IMO there has never been a more perfect time to play that song in a movie.  




 Thank you  




 Denzel Washington, Tom Hanks also Jim Carrey  




 Interesting theory how have I not thought of this already.  




 LOL  




 O okay well I am not religious even if I was I wouldnt care LOL.  




 I have always wanted to read the books and see what happens. I think I will now.  




 probably  









 Likely Juice before he is finally killed by Jax.  




 He was just misunderstood or something like that.  




 Jason Bateman NOOOO!!!!!!!!  




 Yeah that would have been cool.  




 YES!!!!!!!  




 Hobo With a Shotgun  




 Memento, The Dark Knight, Star Wars Episode III, and now Tusk  
























 Because Jim Carrey doesnt like sequels and just recently relented. 




 Paula Patton  




 Ah man im gonna miss it I actually liked it mostly for Karen.  




 Interesting very interesting I had no idea. Also know who ALbert Fish is and wow.  




 Yes hes a villain but not really if ya know wat I mean. Plus he tried to call it off too but was too late.  




 ???????  




 Yeah I kinda wish they had stayed with Evil Jigsaw in the sequels.  




 Is it just me or is Jigsaw on the original Saw a lot more cruel. In all the other movies he says he despises killing people yet Gordon is ordered to kill Adam and he also slashes Tapps throat. Its like he is much more of a psychopath in that one and all the others he seems like a vigilante.  




 Because he had money problems.  




 Okay cool thanks 




 I have always wondered.  




 OMG YES!!!!!!!!!  




 When is this movie coming out damit!!!!!  




 that would give me nightmares  




 maybe  




 Because they were just a waste it seemed like.  




 I will force it out of you. Okay so heres how it goes I understand that you gave birth to me and you care for me but dont freakin talk to me like you understand my life alright. Your such a freaking hypocrite also. I HATE when you drink it makes you into an obnoxious bitch I cant wait to get out of here and i will NEVER call you when I leave for the last time. Oh yeah one more thing when I give my opinion to you you tell me to leave but you have the right to tell me yours all the freaking time?? That makes no sense like at all.  




 My apologies  




 Now thats a working man.  




 I think you know  




 Thanks yeah she was I miss her so much now.  




 Do you just live to annoy me in the most subtle way??? Why is it you always do things that annoy me so much. Like when I want to be alone you come in and steal my solitude from me. Also you never do what is expected of you.  




 She died the other day I miss her so much already my beautiful Daisy I will miss taking her for walks.  




 They will hand it to some one who will be a puppet basically.  




 Jesus you watch The two Hobbit movies all the dam time its like the only movies you watch!!!! Why are you so obsessed with them??? This year alone you must have seen them both 5 times each whats so special about them?? I mean I like Hobbit and LOTR too but not that much. You always complain when you say I rewatch movies but your worse then me you freakin idiot.  




 That has happened to me 3 times for Dont be afraid of the dark, the raid 2, and recently Tusk. It is an awesome experience!!!!! U can text and switch seats as many times as u want to. When I saw The Raid 2 I sat in like 10 different seats.  




 Yeah its just too much.  




 Isnt it annoying when they announce a date for a movie trailer?? I mean we have already been waiting for some footage for months possibly even years dont make us wait longer just release the dam thing.  




 Yeah but probably not.  




 I always get there at least 15 minutes before the movie starts if its a new movie I get there earlier tho. I cannot watch a movie in the theater without a snack so I always get a popcorn and soda depending on the length sometimes candy too. I always sit in the middle so i dont have to crane my head or not. I ALWAYS put seasoning in my popcorn i have been for 3 years now let me think Caramel, Kettle Corn, and Ranch. I dont really eat or drink the snacks during the previews because I like to save it for the movie. I normally go to Harkins Theaters a local chain but sometimes I will go to AMC for a 5 dollar movie. Sometimes I go to a dollar theater too they have a special every tuesday movies for 1.50. Anyways those r my habits.    




 dam stupid marvel  




 His wife has only been in his movies I believe. She basically has no career except in his movies.  




 Yes those are the main 3.  




 Man that really bites.  




 $7 exactly sometimes 7.50 depending on the chain I go to, I usually always get in at matinee price during the evening because I have a student ID.  




 The Catcher in The Rye dam JD and his family so stubborn.  









 Good finale Good show gonna miss it.  




 Good finale I got annoyed with all the flashbacks tho still good poor nucky.  




 UGH I hate when this happens I mean it has prospect and it has Robin Wiliiams so its guaranteed to make money.  




 The Cabin in the Woods  




 I was just thinking of watching this show now  




 Unless its still playing in some theaters then u will have to wait til late november when some torrents hit.  




 All Halloween movies, All Friday the 13th movies, and all Nightmare on Elm Street movies.  




 I just realized that John Wick was released yesterday the same day that the show Constantine premiered on NBC. is that weird???  




 "When I arrive at my destination I am gonna Kill Bill"  




 Its the only time someone actually says Star Trek in Star Trek  




 One of my favorite scary kids movies ever!!!!  




 Its just sitting there noone is touching it sadly I really want to see them too.  




 I thought it was an okay movie good cast and good direction.  




 OOOH LOL!!!!!!!!  




 Okay I get it you are a homophobe you dont like Gays now please STOP saying everytime even the smallest mention of a gay person you criticize it. So annoying everytime I watch Modern Family you comment about Cam and Mitch its getting fucking old!!!! Im slowly starting to think you are in the closet like that guy on American Beauty.  




 WTF  




 Mr Marks doesnt like to be fucked by anyone excet Mrs Marks!!!!!!  




 Does he look like a Bitch!!!!!!  




 Ullysses Something.  




 AHHHH man I liked this show. Gonna miss it.  




 Interesting theory I wouldnt be surprised if it was the truth.  




 Yes great episode last night cant wait for the finale but I am gonna miss this great show.  




 Yes me too I hope it lives up to expectations.  




 He was a scottish sailor who made a deal with calypso to ferry souls who died at sea to the other side.  




 a rant  




 I thought we were friends in real life we had some good convos together but for some reason you refuse to add me??? I want to see what your life is like and you wont add me you suck!!!!  




 Yes you are.  




 Man I wish I can erase my mind and watch that movie again for the first time i was so blown away when I finally saw it.  




 aha sure  




 Harry Potter survived in Deathly Hallows because of the piece of Voldemort inside him he survived because he became the master of the Deathly Hallows.  




 Jack Nicholson and Quentin Tarantino  




 If its already filming why not release it next year?? It is a directtodvd and those dont cost too much.  




 Nice musical scene  




 Its just a limited release in the next few weeks it will get more.   




 OMG I hate the dam news you watch it every dam night!!!!! Sometimes multiple times a day and they just replay the same stories over and over!!!! When you miss just one of them you get annoyed well who cares. When I get my own place I will NEVER watch the news and when you visit and ask to watch it I will not let you!!!!!! I dont know why you are obsessed with that stupid show anyways.  




 What r some??  




 Cant wait to see wat they do to Juice.  




 Yeah im surprised he didnt tell Nero or Alvarez the man really wants to die.  




 Yes  




 Just say that he wasnt actually Spiderman by that time.  




 K I will probably just get new ones tho  




 They didnt really show him its weird. Would have loved to see him.  




 okay cool  




 So I was listening to my headphones today and the left side all of a sudden stopped working. I messed around with it a little bit but then I had to position the cord into a certain position just to hear it out of both sides. I dont want to get rid of them but what is wrong with them?? Can they be fixed cheaply??  




 LOL thanks  




 Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder  




 Oh god yes!!!!!  




 Yes just have them make the amazing spiderman movies intigrated into the mcu.  




 It came out in March  




 Like the shortest amount of time that a trailer was released between the film itself?? Was there ever one that was weeks before a movie opened??  




 The one where Lucille tells George Michael that Maebe "spent her inheritence getting here". I laughed when I first heard that scene.  









 Yeah so that means season 4 of Arrow will be Oliver in prison.  




 Yeah.................................yeah.  




 Thomas Jane  




 I think I found my new job LOL  




 Awesome thank you!!!!!!  




 Okay well thats not right  




 Yeah noone major wants to work with him its a shame cuz he is such a good actor.  




 Its sad that most of the former james bonds arent that big anymore.  




 HAHAH I remember that episode  




 OMFG dude wow!!!!!  




 He didnt like being a star so he only does smaller stuff nowadays.  




 Yeah shes nothing nowadays man she used to be the queen of the world.  




 He still makes stuff he had a few movies this last year.  




 Okay cool  




 o okay alright thanks love reacher  




 I mean there is an arc or something that follows a story 61 hours and worth dying for it says they have a story or something.  




 YES!!!!!!!  




 So I just got back from the library and the only reacher novel they had is A Wanted Man I looked it up and it said it is part of another storyline. Do I need to read the other books 61 hours and worth dying for in order to understand this one?? Id hate to have to take it back.  




 I think he just made a shit ton of money that he didnt think he could work again except for Rush Hour but I did like him in Silver Linings Playbook.  




 He says he is semi retired but he hasnt done a movie for like 4 years so lets just say he is retired.  




 He burned a lot of bridges and stuff and noone wants to work with him anymore. I dont think his career an be saved.  




 Joffrey and then Cersei.
