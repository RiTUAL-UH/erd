 Deadly Premonition 2: The Deadcoming 




 Japanese Hard Dance is so under exposed (which is sad because it's an awesome scene!) and for anyone interested in speedcore check out M1dy

Edit: also if your interested in hardcore checkout Kobaryo, his song clock control is great 




 Awhile ago I really didn't like speedcore... Now I like it, anyways RWC dose some good stuff and I would recommend checking out some of his terrorcore   extra tone if your feeling crazy :' ) and if your not feeling crazy don't worry he also dose hardstyle under the name shingo DJ 




 I'm a little sad this release isn't hard dance but I am sooo happy Mat's back! 




 [Me still in my PJ's on a Sunday](http://imgur.com/DqzWC19) 




 Hardcore for life 




 Get this song for free from the DL's in the description then play dark souls so you can engage in jolly cooperation while you listen! 









 Get this song for free form the DL's in the discription and then play dark souls so you can engage in jolly cooperation while you listen!  




 Baebii :D 




 Ohh... Maby A fine romance by frank or some where beond the sea by Bobby Darin  




 The sad thing is this could actually be a thing that you would see pop up on your news feed 




 I totally forgot about gammer! Also I've never heard that song before so thanks! 




 Oh sweet!, I thought it was that guy he killed... 




 I'm a huge gabber/hardstyle/hard trance head and I've been getting into happy hardcore lately so please give me some suggestions! The only people I know of right now are Rhythmics, Nanobii, S3rl   Matduke 




 What's woolie supost to be? 




 Some one please make a video where all the pics are of woolie/grandma swamp 




 Dude I know, I was reading it and the whole time I was like ":(" the I saw the familiar vegtiable at the end of the article  




 Look closer at the website... 














 He responded to my message on FB and said that it might be hard for him to do because he doesn't really have a method. I for one would love to see how he made the kick from sounds of the machine if he dose decide to make one  














 Just think about it, hiding from lickers in lockers, running away from 2 hunters instead of the twins and of course nemesis would replace walker  
























 Recently I've been listening to a lot of speedcore, terrorcore .etc stuff I told my self I would never enjoy when I started listening to hard dance. As you can tell by the title that has all changed, so please link me the most fucked up stuff you know! 









 I get most of my hardstyle from the yearly Cloud 9 hardstyle compilations (10$ = 100 songs, great deal) recently I found out about the 2014 compilation and to my sadness I already own two of the songs on the compilation (God said 2k14   Reality) are there any songs that grab you as must haves? [iTunes link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/hardstyle-top-100-2014/id893210852) 









 This February me and my friend will get up on stage in front of 500+ high school students and play a 20 min DJ set. He will be doing 10 min of house and I will be doing 10 min of hardstyle, since most people at my school haven't heard of hardstyle I'm going to do a euphoric set as opposed to a raw one. With that in mind I want my set to be the best euphoric, harmonically mixed gateway into hardstyle ever! Even though I have a lot of euphoric stuff I still want to hear from you guys, so please link me some of your favorite euphoric tracks. Also, producers.... Do you have a track that you think 500+ first time hardstyle listeners would love? Well link me some of your stuff and I'll see what I can do to get your song in my mix :) 


































 I think someone could get a lot of mileage out of doing a parody of music production like by referencing modern talking in massive, vengeance sample packs, pirating and other things. FL Studio would probably be the best choice for this but it could still be funny in other programs like ableton, logic, reason, cubase and pro tools

 Hello everyone. As the title says can someone fill me in? I haven't seen any spam (I'm guessing the mods deleted it). Also can someone tell me how it all started, thanks :)

p.s. I promise I'm not trying to agitate the situation if someone tells me to take this down I will. 




 1.What are some of your hobbies? 2. Besides hard dance what other genres on music do you like? 3. Favorite food? 4. What got you into music as a whole? 5. Can I post your response on the hardstyle sub?


1. Hobbies, anything i do is geared towards improving myself and my creativity. Be that weight training (clears body and mind) reading up on art techniques (going through a graffiti phase) or minecraft (started a few days ago, experiencing a new world), I try to keep things varied. Might take up fishing next.
2. I actually try to listen to as little hard dance as possible. This is because I want to keep my 'work' fresh and not to be over saturated with the same sounds all the time. I listen to a lot of drum and bass and movie scores, but often house, trap n moomba.
3. All food when prepared with fresh, quality ingredients is awesome. I do have a soft spot for italian cuisine, but I love a good kangaroo steak too.
4. I got into music because once I heard it, I wanted to make it. Though this question is a bit like Alice in Wonderland, the hole goes as far as you want it to go....
5. Sure. Dunno if its gonna be that interesting tho.

 














 What's your favorite distortion plug-in and why? For me I'd have to say ohmicide, it's easy to use and you can get great results with it 














 Hello all! Yesterday I made a [monstercat anime post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Monstercat/comments/2gil1y/lets_make_a_monstercat_anime/) and from the looks of it, it didn't do too well :/, but I won't let that discourage me! (If this post doesn't do well promise I won't do more) so any ways here's the premise: make up a morning routine for you favorite producer (make it as bad or as good as you want!) I'll start! " Rameses was awoken from his deep sleep by the familiar sound of rain. He quietly got out of bed and went to the window and stared out at the cloudy Yorkshire landscape. "I could wright so meany songs about this" he thought to himself, and before he knew it he had been starring out his window for 30 minuets. When he finally snapped out of it he saw he was going to be late if he didn't hurry, so he quickly ran downstairs grabbed his crumpet with jam and rushed out the door. (forgetting his umbrella I might add :3) 
























 everything is reverberating (even the start up sound) I've tried opening a new project and restarting my computer but nothings working. [heres what it sounds like](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/problem)
EDIT: It is my sound card. dose anyone know how to fix it? 
  














 I've noticed that quite a few people on here listen to rap so tell me... Who are your favorites? Mine are P.O.S/Doomtree, Brother Ali and Atmosphere (you might notice a bias here, that's because I live really close too the twin cities)  



















 "for those curious i'm 90% done with say it ain't so. another week or two and i'll start shopping to labels"
 





























 A while ago I saw this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/2dx51k/ive_always_loved_the_scifi_style_album_covers_for/) about how cool looking pretty lights album art was. So I decided why not share some cool art but this time with a heavy/industrial look. Also for those wondering Vision recordings is Noisia's record label and for those who don't know who Noisia is they are a 3 man neuro funk/DnB group and I highly recommend them!

 I've been getting into Melbourne bounce lately and I need some artist suggestions   









 For me I'd have to say TC's dog [Rex](https://m.facebook.com/tc.bristol/photos/pb.48469779094.-2207520000.1409108882./10152483245584095/?type=1 source=42) 









 I know we have some shufflers/jumpers on here and I would love too see you guys in action! Post a video of your self :D 







































 John Berkey was a artist who made [breath](http://www.fond-ecran.com/ORIGINAUX/divers/john_berkey/john_berkey_011.jpg) [taking](http://www.tucoo.com/fantasy/f_john_berkey/images/sf_john_berkey016.jpg) space ship scenes (and saying that isn't doing his art nearly enough justice). Now, some of you may be thinking "say this looks a little bit like star wars" well thats because he [did](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DuQ1FWS6Iiw/UR70HxsiF6I/AAAAAAAAdVw/3iMF1oTIWzs/s1600/star-wars-cover__john_berkey.jpg) do some art for the star wars movies. Also on an unrelated note John Berkey is the reason I know some one at VALVe and one of the reasons I got to take a tour of VALVe HQ    




 Dear Pat Powertuff, because of your expertise in the subject of RE4 I was finally able to beat it, I also learned a few things from your play through with matt: the Red9 is the perfect weapon for leading a one man crusade across "Rural Europe", the TMP is a hardened black turd (Although the ammo box is super hype), shotguns are mans greatest creation, knifes are great against crazy buff military mans, verdugos are SUPER cool!!, Salazar's whine when he gets stabbed in the hand is one of the best stupid noises I've ever heard, the broken butterfly is basically deaths scythe in the form of a magnum and finally separate ways sucks :( the only kinda good thing about it is you get to stare at Ada's butt the whole time. Best regards, test_subject8320 




 Before I goto bed I like to listen to music and in doing so I've noticed something about myself. Listening to Hardcore, Hard Trance, Hardstyle and Psy/Forest Trance actually helps me sleep while listening to Chill music by people like Mr. FijiWiji, Rameses B and Direct actually makes me less tired. Dose this apply to anyone else or is their just something wrong with my brain?  
























 I honestly love both. I love the happy up beat melodies of UK Hardcore but I also love the violently distorted kicks of Hardcore  









 My questions were:

1. Do you ever plan on doing hardcore (the non happy kind)?

2. Who are your musical influences?

3. I remember you said somewhere that you don't do collabs so if you were forced at gun point who would you collab with?

4. Can I post your response to the monstercat sub? Stay kawaii!!!!


Here's his response:

1. i really dislike the non-happy hardcore you're talking about because it doesn't 
 have any elements at all that i value in music, so no

2. mitch murder (synthwave and 80s music overall), dj shimamura, kz, early owl city.

3. i said i don't do collabs with just ANYONE. there needs to be some form of friendship established through chats or whatever imo. but if i'd have to pick someone it'd be mitch murder

4. sure. you too ()

 





































































 My questions were 1. Who are your musical influences? 2. Are any of your new tracks collaborations? 3. Can I post your response to /r/Monstercat?

Here's what he had to say:

1. I'm influenced by everything- both in music and through visual art! My older tracks just kind of happened, I just sat down and made them, no specific inspiration there!

2. No collabs- I work in a very drawn out way and I like to get things sounding exactly right before moving on, especially with my new music. I don't think many collaborators would be cool with sitting around for months working on something! That said I do have plans to work with vocalists in the future- but not the traditional "vocalist sings verse on track" kind of way, I'll have her sing whatever, and then chop it up/process it like an instrument. I like vocal snippets and how they can convey the emotion of a vocal, without actually having any discernible words. Looking to take that to the next level with my unreleased stuff!

3. Sure thing, fine by me!
 














 its by SMD and it has a guy laughing in the beginning   



















 Free songs are preferred but not required, also it doesn't just have to be monstercat  














 For me it's jay cosmic's remix of rocket  






















































 For me it's a tie between the screech from dragon born by Headhunterz and the screech from destroy by Atmozfears  









 So I did a post like this on the monstercat sub awhile ago and it got a pretty good reception. 
 Rules:
post a mix that your proud of (preferably hardstyle) in the comments and say what you use for mixing the winner will be the person with the most up votes 

* what you win: my respect as a DJ and the love of the sub (possibly) 




 I know Audiofreq has one  




 As you all know Mr. Suicide sheep always finds amazing pictures to go along with his uploads. [My favorite is this one](http://arcipello.deviantart.com/art/Scorched-earth-304068383) it's actually my back round in FL studio  














 Same Rules as [last time](http://www.reddit.com/r/Monstercat/comments/27uk1n/djs_lets_have_a_little_competition/) if you competed last time just post a diffrent mix  





























 So a while ago F3tch released some patches for massive. All of them are very robotic and gritty so they might not be for every producer, but for the ones who make heavy dubstep I would recommend checking them out [heres a link to his FB page](https://www.facebook.com/F3tchmusic/app_220150904689418) 




 "Something more. Better. Greater. Meaningful. Unforgettable. Beautiful.

In the near Future."
 









 Timeless is probably my favorite. Her voice just adds so much to the song  




 Here's what he had to say "Oh awesome!   I've been considering doing some more collabs in the EDM world, maybe something trap-y.   Thanks for showing me yo " 




 By colorful I mean people like Madeon and Grant Bowtie  









 For me it would either have to be Aero Chord or Noisestorm (Aero Chord is from Greece and Noisestrom is from Dublin so it be awesome to hear their sexy accents also) 




 INFO: 
1. Post a mix you've made below (doesn't have to include monstercat songs)
2. Say what software you use (you don't have to but still it would be cool to know)

RULES FOR VOTING:
Be fair and nice, don't judge on length but on song choice, transitions, etc. 

The winner will be the person with the most points on their comment 

WHAT YOU WIN: 
1. My respect as a DJ
2. The love of our savior GQ (Maybe)   




 What do you guys think? 




 I have been watching quiet a few videos from before 2010 and I have to say, the Melbourne shuffle is really cool and it makes me a little sad that its not as popular as it used to be. So /r/ Monstercat can we bring it back or should I ask /r/ Hardstyle about this ?   




 When do you guys think it will be released?  
























 Dude I know... BS2 gets hate sometimes but I loved it, while the story did have afew plot holes I felt it improved on everything else especially combat and atmosphere (plus Minerva's den is probably one of my fave DLC's of all time) 




 Didn't superman kill more people in MOS then Godzilla in the latest Godzilla film?
 




 Should I buy it? (I own all the bioshocks and love them all to death especially BS2)
EDIT: Bought SS2 and I'm really surprised on how well it holds up (game play wise any way) It was definitely worth the 3$ and I also am hearing some sound effects that were used in BS1   




 I found a bunk file in my uninstall, removed it and everything is fine now :)  




 At my school some kids have speakers in their back packs... Needless to say its fucking irritating  




 Thanks :) 




 Recently I downloaded VLC media player off a bad site and it screwed with internet explorer and chrome (slower then normal and pop-ups). I was able to find where the junk files installed and deleted the file and completely cleared my browser cash but chrome is still running slow and while it happens a lot less then before I'm still getting pop-ups. Virus scans show nothing (windows defender) (I don't know my specs from memory so I will update this later if need be). 




 Wow man! Thanks for this, I could never really pin down what nu-style was so I guessed as much but form the bottom of my heart... Thanks :) P.S. Yoji is awesome (still trying to find a place where I can buy airport :/) 




 One of Shingo's older songs, the kick isn't great and with youtube being what it was back in 09 the quality is a little rough. Look past that however and you will be hooked! P.S. If your into speedcore check out Shingo's other alias Round Wave Crusher (RWC) 









 I AM RADIATING HYPE LIKE A SUPER SAYAN! 




 I see what you mean 




 I use to draw the line at Gabber but now I've heard it all, Speedcore all the way up to extra tone. I traveled to the edge of the abyss, listened and enjoyed what I heard :^ ) 




 :( I didn't get to see the show because the the venue was 18+  




 Slum Village - Fall in love (Moody Good Remix) 




 Life with a monster girl..... ^^^^^^^^^^^Iwasneverhere 




 Captain: "Run full speed and just don't think about it"

Crew member: "But captain I don't think..." 

Captain: "Don't think about it"  




 OMG! That's the exact sign from FO3   FO:NV 

EDIT: Just rememberd that Bethesda was the publisher for this game 




 His FB page is still active but as for realeases IDK 









 I don't really know of any albums but have you tried hard trance? :) It's great for zoning out and quite a few of the songs I have heard have a bit of a sci-if feel to them :) check out the song "disarray" by Lisa lashes, Alex kidd   Kidd kaos (be sure to let me know if you need suggestions :D 




 Not exactaly what I'm looking for but thanks for showing me this :) it's got a really nostalgic vibe to it 




 Dose anyone know of any songs that have propaganda samples form WWII or The Cold War? 




 Do you guys know of any songs with samples of propaganda from WWII or The Cold War 




 He also tweeted at nanobii that he loved his music  




 Yes! Happy Hardcore FTW! If you like this track you might also like UK Hardcore and Hands-Up! 




 You mean Castles in the sky by DJ Satomi? That song is my jam! 









 Ohhhh.... I see what you mean and no I don't think so 




 Man... Qlimax 2006 looked like it was a lot of fun! Who did the anthem for this one? 




 I don't understand the question 




 NP :) 




 Neilio releases on labels like dirtyworkz and skranix (Hardstyle labes) 




 I haven't heard of any of those guys before! Guess I got to do some searching :)

 Also if your looking to get into freeform check out [Alek Szahala](http://youtu.be/uube-JJarcc) 




 Also while he isn't japanese, Shingo DJ/Round Wave Crusher has done a lot of touhou remixes and samples a lot of Hentai/Anime for his songs

 Remember when Prizyms first started posting Hardstyle to the sub? Well it's been a while and I have to ask, how dose everyone feel about hard dance now? I Actually love it more then I ever thought I would! I've been listening to genres I though I would always hate (speedcore and beond)  









 LOVE R.O. Belgian swing was amazing!  




 theirs a art to being a charming ass and Joel nails it  




 "Dike Martians" I guess monstercat's home planet was pretty kinky (   ) 




 He also loves hardstyle 




 Especially so if said artists have done work with noisia! 




 You guys should bug nick to get a reddit account 




 Maby a part for string bass? :D 




 It's awesome knowing that you like bee and puppy cat 

EDIT: what did you think of the first two episodes? 




 All we need is nick and the entirety of evol intent will be here 









 Computer club ILY M8 p.s. The liquid was amazing 3 




 Monstercat should meet a girl monstercat at some point. I think that would be cute 




 Prizymz actually is spinnin' (he dose their cover art) 









 If your not familiar with EVOL Intent, it is a group of three guys (one of those guys being bro safari) who mainly make DnB and have done songs with Noisia and give out a lot of their music for free over soundcloud  




 Your GQ comes with a free car, but you gotta pay tax  




 Ill do my best senpai!!!! (  ) 




 any idea where i can find some good reads on supersaws? :) 




 Dose anyone know of any good patches/tutorials? I have the FL signature bundle and harmor if that helps :) 









 [Downlink and Calvertron - Immortal (F3tch Remix)](http://www.beatport.com/track/immortal-f3tch-remix/5773480)

 









 TFW when you don't have a monstercat to snuggle with 




 Kawaii AF + DnB x nanobii - possible cover art by skrillbug if he chooses to finish this = ()*:	 




 It's one of the songs that got me started on trance  




 Wow that's a good remix! [heres a link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7UVCxcW46Y) to RWC's remix of reach for the moon immortal smoke 




 If your interested you should checkout some of shingo's other thohou remixes, he's done a lot. (He's also remixed a few songs as Round Wave Crusher) 




 I will do the best I can :) 




 Just downloaded Bad Boi   the uncaged remixes. Looking at my Traktor library I'm sitting on a lot of PBN songs, sooo mega mix anyone.... All the PBN songs I have (excluding the one's I can't mix nicely) originals and remixes 




 Not a huge fan of the kick in this one but if you look past it and listen to the melody you will be hooked!!!  









 That sounds awesome!!!! It could be a genre use to classify futile Japan style trance 




 Why can't people just leave the poor guy alone? 




 Plus more money to swery means a better chance of D4 Pt.2 coming out 




 Your pickles come with a free car but you got to pay tax on it 




 Swery should get a reddit account so people can ask him about clam chowder  




 I see him! 
 




 0_0 wow... And I thought Mordor was inhospitable before. This would actually be really cool in the movies though, a place where you are either freezing or super hot, all while being watched by the eye 




 Like pats many little babby yelps could be used for text notifications 

"AH!" Ooo it looks like I got a text 




 Oh wow :( I just got a really sad though in my head... It's of shep. Going into the gun room and seeing one of the those tags hanging from one of the guns and silently weeping because she got the Turian she loved killed 




 Ya up here in Wisconsin it gets down to -10 F at night 




 Come on man learn the lore, everyone knows the Asari evolved from crabs /s 




 you'd probably want WAV. or higher for modding 

EDIT: Actually you could use MP3's it just depends on how well compressed they are 




 I didn't notice the legs until you guys pointed it out.... jeez it looks like Liara was staying in the uncanny valley when this was painted   




 The thumbnail makes it look like shes doing [this](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121209083120/adventuretimewithfinnandjake/images/a/a6/Mckayla_is_Unimpressed.png), Cool shep. though! :D 




 Bring it here bro *opens arms for hugz* 




 I think they would make really cool one shots for DJing 




 I would really like one in red (purple is a sweet color but I've always liked the red hoods better)  




 Oh the fun I will have with this in FL 11 




 Freeform!!!! Check out Alek Szahala  




 You might like freeform :) it's a combination of hardcore and trance. [Check this one out](http://youtu.be/uube-JJarcc) 














 Woa... :0 thanks dude! 




 I've been getting into the genre lately and I was woundering if some one could give me some suggestions :) 




 Actually their all full tracks (with a few edits thrown in) 




 I accidentally deleted my comment with all the songs I linked :I I'll just give them to you and link them later 

Ophidian - Sounds of the machine 

Meander (Ophidian's crossbreed alias) - Greyscale

Angerfist - And Jeasus wept 

Kobaryo - Clock Control 

I:gor - The Devil has a name

Outside Agency - Hours   Dreams

S3rl - Feel the melody  




 Thanks man! 




 In E-force's song seven the tempo goes up at the second climax and then goes back to 150 for the next, dose anyone know what the tempo goes up to? I'm having a hard time figuring it out  




 If you showed him a pic of that he would block you on Twitter  




 Hard Dance: Kobaryo (he's already had a few releases on mob squad but it would be cool to see him bring the gabber sound to MC) 




 All right m7s let's get to know eachother a little better :), I absolutely love hard dance! If you don't know what that is it's stuff like hardcore, hardstyle, hard house, hard trance .etc 




 How did you get out of Skyrim with the war going on? (Torbjrn is the most Skyrimish name I have ever heard) 




 Scary monsters and nice sprites will always have a special place in my heart 




 Lisa lashes v.s Alex Kidd and Kidd Kaos - Dissaray (amazing hard trance) 




 Oh..... OH! Ow  




 During sophomore year (last year) this freshman girl came to school with face paint on. I'm talking full face cheeta patern..... P.S. You sound like a cool girl :) 




 toonie? 




 I remember back in middle school in the wake of COD black ops people would sharpen pencils to a dangerous point and whip them at each other while yelling "Tomahawk!" I think one kid got stuck in the leg with a colored pencil  




 I followed the advice given to me and I have to say I'm happy with how it turned out, I updated the [PP](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-dST9JfmygNvSEaYppJVyBqe36W_bYfXJMalfE6xZjU/edit?usp=sharing) and the [mix](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/hard-dance-lession-update) (this one flows a lot better), I also dropped Breakcore in favor of Tekstyle and I think a certain someone on this sub will be happy with my hardstyle song choice ;) *cough cough* /u/audiofrq     




 I know the pic he's talking about!! Allow me to do some digging 

EDIT: [Found it!](http://25.media.tumblr.com/bb0681713936b617bc3d3ac099dbaee7/tumblr_muqkczkYBi1s0aezvo1_250.png) sorry the image is so small

 Have you heard his latest album? One word... Lush 




 we must de-Liam them before the milk goes sour and makes woolie (and anyone really) vomit  




 Where do I sign up?! 




 Woa Jack of sound... on Mcat.... 3 




 The R Is Silent is amazing! great combo of neruo and dubstep 




 Did anyone notice the ships shadow? It was like 20FPS  




 ...will help Liam pay off his vita, ...will help us get Liam out of the vents, ...will help Liam get gud, ...Will help save school girls from Liam (all I got for now)

EDIT: it should cut to Liam holding his vita crying and saying it was worth it surrounded by the 3 games the vita has 




 It would be cool to see this girl do a cover of bad apple 




 Probably ment to say "what the F" but engrish  




 He was trained by a master of CQC 




 0_0 I never knew you were on reddit! Also thank you for answering my question, I think I speak for everyone on here when I say that I can't wait! 




 Thanks! This will help a lot with kick making  




 So in less techinal terms it's the "Punch" at the beginning of the kick? P.s. Thank you :) 




 Sorry for the noobish question but I've been seeing the term a lot and I don't really have a firm grasp on it 




 It would be cool to see more electro from him but I have to say his mid-tempo stuff is my favorite 




 Check that reverse bass! 









 I remember reading some where that ophidian and Sam were working on something together, did anything ever come out of it? 




 If be fine with that especially if we get more songs like mirror mirror 




 Get your sides to send picks (especially of the clam chowder) 




 Yes yes yes yes!!! 




 Me too ^^^^choo^^^^choo 




 Sadly my presentation can only be 10min and putting showtek in there is just me forgetting to put "(older work)" next to them 




 Oh I didn't mean boring in that way, what I meant was if you find that it's becoming a slog or if your getting bored working on a track taking a little video game (or anything else really) break can be refreshing and will inspire/clear your mind 




 Hmmm.. You do have some good points, I'll rework it a bit and see if I can get a better progression out of it. Also before I replaced it with "worth fighting for" the song I had was Accelerate, the reason I changed it was it didn't think it went with all the other songs I have in the mix  




 Same with me but just remember when it starts to get boring a little break can make you feel awesome :) 




 VIDEO GAMES!!!
 




 Hello everyone! you may remember me as the guy who asked for euphoric hardstyle needed in a [mix for a school talent show](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardstyle/comments/2itn3g/a_call_to_everyone/), well here's an update. Me and my friend decided to do our own things for the talent show, it was after that I got to thinking "why just show people hardstyle when there's a whole genre of music (Hard Dance) I could expose them too". So after some work I have made a mix and a power point, I'm going to do a live mix while projecting the power point behind me. Each slide will have the genre of the current song, facts and what song is currently playing. This is where you guys come in, [heres a link to the mix](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/hard-dance-lession) [and heres a link to the PP](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-dST9JfmygNvSEaYppJVyBqe36W_bYfXJMalfE6xZjU/edit?usp=sharing), I've made it so you guys can leave notes on the PP in case I got any facts wrong. Thanks in advance :)  




 [Based freq gave a good explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardstyle/comments/287r9t/holy_shtball_these_kicks_sound_like_nuclear/ci8ww6v) 




 I searched "kpop hardstyle" 









 He's soo cute 




 [ummmmmm](https://soundcloud.com/djmatduke/matduke-utopia) 




 IDK what arion's been up too and as for GQ he might be working on some music  




 Kai wachi hype! 




 Never never never never compare yourself to your favorite producer/s it never helps the creative process and it will make you feel bad about your self. I'm an aspiring hard dance producer and when ever I think I have a good kick I remember how sweet and amazing ophidians, audiofreqs, zatoxs, angerfists, nosferatus.etc kicks sound and I feel so bad. Take your time, watch some videos (seamlessR FTW) and most importantly have fun because if your not having fun your basically working a day job you payed 600$+ for 




 Link to the space fund plz 




 For those wondering where this is from, in the gal gun video Liam said that plague sent him a link to these. Oh plague senpai... (`) you with your ahegao faces and busty furry girls (still waiting on the fan art of the lizard girls from bug island plague)
 





























 YOOOOOOO!!!! I need more pat samples [Post them here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/2tslr7/dose_anyone_have_any_audio_clips_of_pat_they/) 









 yes... 




 Someone bug ultra pancake on twitter to make this happen NAO!! 




 I'm working on a song and all it needs is an angry leprechaun  









 Frenchcore is a genre, it's known for its punchy synthetic kicks 




 Hmmm, I get what your saying I kind of feel the same way about hands-up, plus this isn't the best example of a Frenchcore kick. [Heres a better example](http://youtu.be/ymzJeo-3b1I) 









 Rage is the embodiment of pure blackness and rage 




 Today class we will go over proper cunilingus edict "later during class" oops I droped my pen *gigles as she bends over to pick it up*  




 Thanks man! that was going to bug me... 




 I can't bleave I forgot it's name, it's the one where the girl puts a bag in between her legs and shakes her butt until she gets tired all while going "hado! hado! hado! hado!" 




 Sure thing! Frenchcore is known for its extremely synthetic punchy kicks [Heres a song by hellfish](http://youtu.be/EjKmr3lllsw) 




 RWC is making a Frenchcore alias the only thing is he can think of a name. So why don't we help him out! 









 F F F 3respektz5u 




 I really like Darude, his tech mix of "in the darkness" is fantastic 




 Venetian Snares, the things that man has made just blow my mind, 7/4 for life! 









 Not bad, the percussion was a little too loud, this has a lot of great ideas so just keep at it :) p.s. PM me one of your FLPs sometime it would be fun to collab with you 




 Ya pyramid head go ahead and take that pipe from Alex, he's a chode anyway 




 Occasionally you will hear a scream coming from rage's chest, when that happens rage sends out his soul to beat up the soul that screamed. 




 :O 




 Sorry :(, I feel pretty embarrassed now because I just figured out the beat grid, I was doing two notes per measure instead of 8 (I thought I was doing correctly). Sorry if I came off as a D-bag, no hard feelings? :( 




 p.s. RULES OF NATURE!!! 









 I've been doing that and I'm still not 100% happy with it and as for how it sounds [You'd be surprised](http://youtu.be/kM73tcr16Rs) 

EDIT: please don't down vote this. Everyone has a right to their own opinion but just because you don't like terrorcore doesn't mean you should down vote my post/comment   




 you might be wondering why anyone would want to go faster then 522, well that's because I'm making a terrorcore song and I want it to be 666 BPM :D, I've gone past 522 before but I cant remember how. Can someone help me out? 




 great song but not exactly what I'm looking for, come to think of it the stuff I'm looking for would probably be classified as Big Room/Main Stream house :/ any ways heres another [example](https://soundcloud.com/fiveandadime/5-a-dime-tempo-6-59-songs-in-an-hour-1) (start at 46:34) P.S. this mix actually has a lot of the kind of music I'm looking for      




 I'm looking for a certain kind of electro house. It's a little difficult to describe but I'm looking for stuff with massive build-up's and drops that focus on one crazy sound. [The best example I have is this song](http://youtu.be/UEDF_IRT9NM) 




 Sure thing :) 









 They haven't, I just posted this because the zaibatsu/people on here love Jojo :) 




 If it was the other way around it would be OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 




 You expected Summer Lovin' but it was me DIO!!! 




 [actually....](http://avielsusej.deviantart.com/art/Mordo-s-Regular-Adventure-Polnarigby-H5-Chariot-408212982) 




 Those snoop samples just add so much! 














 just look at that smile! 









 Jeasus that red head was a bitch..... 




 The game really goes to shit in the second act when you go to town. Here's a list of reasons why the town sucks: 1. Grey brown and rainy, 2. zombies that are on fire 3. Zombies with helmets 4. Zombies with BASIC weapons that can do STUPID amounts of damage (they can also throw the weapons) 5. The Ram  




 Ain't that the truth, I completed one when I was still in the hotel and went up to like level 60 but all the weapons stayed at level 1 2 




 although she dose have a lazy eye... but I have to admit that she was the LEAST hate-able character from the game     




 Ya RWC gets it right 









 No Sam B 0/10 - IGN, in all seriousness this game looks like everything dead island should have been in the first place (I sold and re-bought dead island twice and pat was super right the game just falls apart around the end) I REALLY tried to enjoy it but I just couldn't  




 Chili dogs 




 :D p.s. [heres his remix of native faith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8giKbzcxA-E)
 




 Thanks :D that means a lot coming from the based freq himself!

 What show is it? 




 I think technically this is DnB but I don't care because this song is as happy as a rainbow milkshake  









 Its cool :)
 




 I haven't checked but I'm going to guess no, [do some searching on here](http://www.doujinstyle.com/forum/) I normaly hate torrenting but with most Japanese releases its the only way 









 Oh wow, so meany things.... But if I had to say one it would be a new appreciation for Japanese developed ps2 games  




 http://www.ppf2014.info/ found this awhile ago and I really love it

 one of the more interesting trapstyle songs I have heard 









 Ha I wish, but seriously I am hyped for this! 




 I tried :( it's giving me an error now sadly I think I'll have to reinstall FL  




 :) 









 The most important thing is did you like it? 




 another one from you. This time its happy hardcore :3 




 if your looking to get into tech trance I would recommend Darude, I'm serious his rush album is great!  




 did you do the cover art for this priz? 




 dose any one know how to fix this? 




 Good: Ophidian, The Outside Agency, Nosferatu, Art of fighters, Digital punk, Massive New Krew, Radical Redemption, Meander, The Prophet, Yandere Complex and The Dark Oscillators 

Bad: Body Lotion (srsly wtf), You, Psycho 909, Tone, The Wild Motherfuckerz and The Donkey Rollers  




 Oh and for future reference, the stuff your looking for is called Happy Hardcore and/or UK Hardcore (just incase you want to find more :D) 




 I agree with you on the bass. Anyways if you like this then keep an eye on F3tch, he just released a collab with Gawtbass and he has an EP coming out on NSD:BL on the 26 









 Check out some [freeform](http://youtu.be/O2El0dpEYH0) this is a mix for a free compilation and the DL for said comp. is in the description :) 




 Woa.. I always thought it was just his website. That's awesome! 




 Since my last post did better then expected, I decided why not post some more Japanese music. This time it's Gabber :) p.s. Checkout more of Kobaryo's stuff, he is a god 









 EVE gave you a lot of good suggestions so check those guys out. The only other person I can think of that EVE didn't mention is DJ Shimamura (nanobii loves him) 




 Japanese DnB is like a milk shake. Sweet and satisfying! p.s. check out more of you's stuff, he's really good  









 But blur doesn't have a sound track by Noisia c: (I've never played blur and I'm not hating on it I just really love Noisia) 




 Ya I can definitely imagine driving down a highway to this. Sun setting as my Delorean rolls down the coast at 66MPH 




 Glad I could help :) 




 Made by me :), not asking for feed back on this just take a listen if you need to zone out for awhile    









 Oh! One last important thing, if you want to find some great music look for touhou remixes. Just search touhou schranz, hardstyle, hard trance, nu-style. Etc and your bound to find some good songs :) some of my faveorite songs being ice cheinsaw by moro nuclear blast by siromaru and bad apple by Shingo Dj 




 Words to live by  




 ooohhh.... name your price :) 




  Hello everyone, I was just looking at the reddit comments for the drift stage video and I noticed that some of you seem to like retro/80's synth music. So please; sit down, make yourself comfortable, pop a boner and let's circlejerk about some music! :)

*unzips pants* I'll start, I'm absolutely in love with the hotline Miami sound track, all the songs just fit so well, their psychedelic but still danceable. As for artist I love Mitch Murder if you don't know who he is then let me tell you why you should love him, 4 words: [He remixed Guiles theme](https://soundcloud.com/daataa/mitch-murder-guiles-theme) 




 Motherfuckers act like they don't know about [Mitch Murder](http://youtu.be/hugowO0sSrM)

P.S. If your still not convinced [heres](https://soundcloud.com/daataa/mitch-murder-guiles-theme) his remix of guiles theme 









 Oh massive circleZ isn't an artist, their compilation albums released by massive new krew, so far their have been 4 




 Sure thing :)

Edit: actually I don't know a lot of Japanese Hardstyle artists either :/ The two consistent artists I know of are Shingo Dj and Massive New Krew, again the thing I noticed is most artists produce all kinds of hard dance, not just Hardstyle 




 Fuck ya! Japanese hardstyle! 




 I look at who some of my fav artists are following on soundcloud 




 Heck yes 3 love roughsketch 




 Maybe an artists logo is hidden in the pic? 




 [Japanese stream hardcore 4 album preview](http://youtu.be/IZRvaeJUKjw) my favorite song from this album is clock control by Kobaryo, the melody is spot on 

[Massive Circlez 2 cross fade demo](http://youtu.be/IZRvaeJUKjw) all the Massive Circlez compilations are gold, most Japanese producers make all kinds of hard dance but the massive new krew consistantaly make Hardstyle so check them out

As for buying these... Well most Japanese releases I've seen are physical copy only and they are only available from various Japanese websites (so unless you speak Japanese or your browser translates it for you, you might have a hard time finding out if the CD's are still in stock / if they ship outside of Japan). the Japanese stream hardcore comps. Are on iTunes as for the Massive Circlez you might have to result to torrenting. I can PM you the torrent file if need be 




 It doesn't matter where their from :) let me rephrase my question "what is your favorite hardstyle producing country?" (Go indeapth about it, I like the food, the culture, the kicks. Etc) I should have clarified that, sorry :( 




 Japan FTW!!!

EDIT: I really like Japanese Hardstyle   Hardcore because their kicks sound a lot diffrent from most Italian / Dutch Hardstyle   Hardcore. Plus anime samples sound really cool if used well  




 You can find some defqon and q dance related stickers kicking around online (along with other events/festivals) I don't have any links for those sorry :( but if your into hardcore I do have a link to the MOH [store](http://store.mastersofhardcore.com/moh-car-sticker) 




 Woa man, forget music in your blood, its in your DNA, it's part of your biological code (I guess that's why you guys were called bioweapon huehuehue) 




 Ever wonder how pat stays so short and angry? Well now you know, pure 100% Irish piss  




 You can't imagine how much fun were having by atmosphere. Slug is a poet personal fav from the album being "say hey their" also check out their song "god loves ugly" 









 all while the Joestars cheer rage on for fear of being curb stomped  




 OMG! THE JOESTAR MEN v.s RAGE v.s DIIIOOOO!! 




 More like 1/4 of a man 1/2 of a man and a full pie theif 




 Let's get to know each other alittle better :) you don't need to say a lot about yourself if you don't want to so one little fact is all I ask.

My name is Ethan and I love mass effect! Biotic for life! (But you probably knew that I loved ME) 

Anyways I love all things hard (hard as in hard dance... I saw your mind in the gutter there) but seriously Hard house, hard trance, hardstyle, hardcore. Etc, I love everything about it especially hard trance (speaking of which if your into listening to music and gaming Hard trance+ME=bliss)  




 True that :) 




 Interesting.... Mind elaborating? 	(      )	
 




 For me it would have to be Seth Green. I would love to pick his brain a bit (also their should really be a ME robot chicken skit) 




 THIS SOUNDS LIKE A CONVERSATION THAT WOULD BE IN JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE!!!  




 sorry if these kind of posts are looked down on. if you want a good laugh I highly recommend checking out the rest of the page I got this from   









 I guess if your really, and I mean reeeaaaallllyyyy into being choked you would be happy 









 I'm still waiting on plague to draw some fan art of the lizard girls :T 




 Disclaimer!!!!!!: I did not make this! All credit goes to "NotAnAnimator" I saw how little views this video had and saw that it hadn't been posted here yet so I decided why not post it and help it get more views :) (sorry for any confusion) 









 Keep in mind this is a radio rip. So it could get better 









 In this off beat adventure set way up north in Canada a solider who is not well liked by his unit and a AI who wants nothing more then to destroy all of humanity fall in love and decide to run off across the small 30 mile island all while being pursued by the incompetent unit commander, the smoker, mutants with shotguns on their arms and the creators of the AI who know she's good deep down. Can our young lovers keep their gear from degrading? Will the solider ever put a point into psi powers so he can finally use kinetic redirection? Will the AI ever stop making fun of humans and their shitty skin and organs? I don't know maybe.... Ya maybe. Find out if your questions will ever be answered on April 11th, 1999 all while listening to a sound track that's made up of orchestral music and 1999 DnB and trance with lazy flanging to make it more trancy! 




 If I ever decide to have a fallout party I would like a sound track to match :) the only two songs I know of currently are [Paradise Falls by Geck-e](http://youtu.be/3VO6NBZNNAI) and [War never changes by Psycho 909](http://youtu.be/Ox9OvRvXebQ) 




 *Shodan procides to project a full body video feed in your cyber interface, as you ogle her sexy, luscious robo body you fail to notice a hybrid behind you. He procides to cave your skull in with a pipe and steal your cyber interface so the entire flesh can enjoy the fruits of their "mothers" body. You did not survive the adventure." (BTW in wrighting this I realize that people will probably think I have a thing for Shodan. I assure you I do not, I mean seriously have you seen her face? She is the definition of a butter face) 




 And a little stuffed vault boy  




 I think the closets were going to get to quantum is MTN Dew volt. Plus nuka cola doesn't help you acheve euphoria (I'm on /r/montageparodies a lot) although it would be cool to have a soda that doubles as a glow stick
