No me pregunten por qu pero la noche anterior, cuando nos estbamos acostando, le dije que no vaya a donde tena que ir. Simplemente tenia un mal presentimiento. Nos despertamos 6:30 am y se lo volv a decir, quera que se quede en casa conmigo, y bueno, lo hizo.       

Nos despertamos 9 y pico con el mismo escenario, 25 mil llamadas perdidas cada uno, y empezar a tratar de entender qu estaba pasando. Fue horrible para nosotros que estbamos en casa, no me quiero ni imaginar para el resto de la gente que lo vivi de mucho ms cerca.          

Fue algo fortsimo, al da de hoy sigo pasando por el mural de Once, y s que si me detengo a verlo, me angustio instantneamente.

 You're very welcome! It's crazy indeed. Even more crazy was that in that time of war, our newspapers and TV news channels said *we were winning the war*, when that was absolutely incorrect. Bare in mind, lots of TV shows made 24hs transmissions with entertainment content to gather food and clothes for the soldiers, all of which ended up in the hands of the generals and commandants, and none of the soldiers... 

It's a very interesting subject, what happened in Argentina (well, latinamerica to be more precise) around the late 70s and early 80s. Google it and you'll be amazed with the numbers. For example, close to 30.000 people were abducted, tortured, killed and disappeared by the military forces that were in power then, only in Arg. The huge majority of their bodies are still missing, with little to no data about what happened to them.

It's a part of our story that is very present to this very day, because a lot of the babies that were stolen by the same forces then are now adults who rediscover their identities with DNA tests and come foward as "hijos/nietos de desaparecidos" (sons/grandsons of disappeared people). Lots of us (me including) have family members or family friends who've been abducted and tortured. It was a dark time, and a scar that isn't quite cured yet. 




 I think you should go and see a doctor, you may be experiencing a stroke 




 I'll try to be brief, it's a very long subject, but basically... British people have populated the Falkland Islands for a long time, and they've claimed it as their own. In 1976-1983 there was a military dictatorship goverment in Argentina, and between all the shitty and genocidial decisions they took, they decided to "recover" the Islands. They sent 18 year old boys with faulty old weapons, very few clothes and very few food to battle agains a very, VERY superior british army.

Of course our country lost that war, leaving 600+ dead argentinian boys and a huge scar in the history of our country. The Falklands remain british territory, and some people here say that we should reclaim them again, that they are ours, not theirs.

If you ask me, the majority of people of my age (I'm 23 years old) doesn't really care about them. I say leave them the Islands, we can't get our country to run properly, why add more territory that we can't handle? It was pretty good trade point but we don't use that kind of export zone anymore, so we don't really have a use for them. 

Also, in my age group, there's very little to no hate towards british people or their culture. It's a thing that older people have mostly, and generaly they're also big retards in other aspects of life or political understanding. That war was just an excuse to mantain the dictatorship longer in power. The militar that was president then and that commanded the war (General Leopoldo Galtieri) was a dude that LITERALLY went to public speeches totally DRUNK, and sometimes with a glass of whisky in his hands. So, as you can see, this war was pretty pointless to begin with.

Since then (1983) a lot of the argentinian culture was based on that british hate. For example, that soccer game where Armando Maradona passed alone like 4 or 5 rivals and scored a goal is mostly remembered here not only because it was a great play, but also because it was against Britain in the World Cup. 

I for one can't hate someone just because they were born here or there, it just seems stupid to me. I know that the majority of british youth doesn't even care about that war and/or us, so... It's all good.

 /r/cringe 




 I agree with you, but I wanted to say something about this bit

 Unless they come up with some novel way of procedural generation of areas to make it feasible but I doubt this will be a surefire fix to this problem.

Bare in mind that Diablo 3 (and I'm sure other games do this as well) already has something similar; in the infinite dungeons you get random generated dungeons (that could be caves or spaces in TES) that never end until you either die or choose to get out. I see this could be applying in TES with a few tweaks in the future to make it more RPG-alike and less ARPG, like Diablo 3.
 




 I think what he meant is that in a future we could mod SkyWind and SkyBlivion into Skyrim, to make it all a single game.

Now that I think about it, could this be actually done? I haven't played other TES other than Skyrim, but I'm guessing they occur in different times and the stories could get crossed. 




 There's just so much of it 




 Spanish! Sorry I took so long answering this, I didn't see your comment haha

 De la Ra declar Estado de Sitio con toque de queda y murieron manifestantes bajo su poder a mano de fuerzas armadas que estaban reprimiendo, y defendiendo esa animalada. Tambin fue el presidente responsable cuando se tom la medida del "corralito". Son datos fcticos y con sangre, algo MUY distinto a las *acusaciones* por enriquecimiento ilcito. Ests comparando cualquier cosa, me parece errneo decir "por mucho menos". De la ra tenia un pas entero en su contra y decidi tomar una medida an peor. 




 The sad part for me is that this isn't even the first time I've got rickrolled this year. 









 I work at a pharmacy and I was restocking the aspirine section, when I dropped 2 boxes to the floor and accidentaly tripped with them.

15:17: tripped.     
15:17: im on the comedown now.      
15:17: I think I really hit bottom, no more drug dropping for me.     




 After two weeks of being dankrupt, I learned that my dealer got busted, and it appears that he's going away for a long time. This is super bad news to me as I don't know any other good dealers, and in my country is hard to get good weed.

Maybe I'll start growing my own, but its going to take time and practice. Sigh, it's a sad day for me, ents. I'm forseeing months without any, but well, I guess it was about time to start growing my own.

Uptoke for me tonight, friEnts. I love you all. 




 *I included a TL;DR at the end.*

So, last night I was wondering if I could consume Salvia in an edible way, to get a longer and more controlable/less chaotic trip, but the problem was I had only an extract (40x) and not the leaves.

After reading a bit, I decided that the best way of getting there with the tools I had was smoking slowly and in slow quantities. Around 00:30 my parents went to sleep, so I locked the door, made sure there wasn't anything breakable in my surroundings, got the water pipe out, the torch lighter, and the extract. This was my first time solo, and I wanted to go slowly and with care. I had 2 pretty strong experiences and 1 total breakthrough with Salvia, but always with friends, music, and lights on.

So, I smoked a bit and felt a little bit weird at about 3 minutes. This was still with the lights on. I still knew who and where I was, and that I was feeling like that because of the drug. I take another hit and now things begin to vibrate. I'm starting to loose the grip of my selfness and begin to see my vision sense as something more abstract, more "decontextualizable". I begin to see my perception of my life itself as something material, more simplified and understandable. I believe at that point that I'm going too fast, so I wait a bit, and when the high goes a bit down at 10 minutes, I pack another small bowl and hit it, but now I'm with the lights off and near to my bed.

When I did this, I lay down in the bed and put on an eye mask (those things they give you in airplanes so you can't see), and now I begin to see myself, my conciousness, as I start to "fall" from reality. After a couple of minutes of mild visuals and "seeing" myself, I decide to take another hit, a bigger one, and when I do, I lay down again, put on the mask, and exhale. When I did, I began to see my perception and my mind itself, my "way of thinking, of perceiving, of existing in this body" in a very material way. I mean that I materialised my very existance and understood in that moment that I am not only a human being, this is one my forms and therefore one of my many, many realities. I saw myself as an infinite being, which has no notion of past and future, only present, and that this, my human form of thinking, of existing, and of perceiving, is only one way of an arranged and organised way of existance. 

I saw the very fabrics of my reality, I now understand that what I perceive is a frame in a multiple quantity of frames, each one different from the other. I am currently in this one, but with Salvia I fell from it and watched it from far away, with perspective. 

Now, this is important. I began to panic because I couldn't think and perceive the existance as I used to, and I was afraid to be this way for ever, because I had understood reality itself and now there was no turning back. But, when this happened, I remembered that someone here said to "let go". Just let go your way of thinking, stop trying to control everything that happens on your trip, and surrender yourself to randomness. I did, I gave up every control I was trying (unsuccessfully) to have and it was very liberating. I fell in the flow of my trip and all traces of fear were gone. 

And then, I peaked. I saw ripples of different realities being generated with each motion of myself and with each thought, and in an infinite loop saw how these very realities formed a much giant larger one, like a field of reality made of little tiny other ones, and this giant larger one reapeated itself infinitely to form another giant reality, and so and so on, for eternity. I remember trying to stand up (in these other realities, I was really in bed and not trying to stand up for real), and when I did, I remembered that I've been always standing up for eternity and saw myself doing it for ever. I was wordless, I was witnessing the fabrics of existance and I won't ever forget that. It was one of the most gorgeous things I've ever seen.

This went on for 2 hours **(!)** and it had ups and downs. As I began to enter reality again, I saw it as more complex and more "in focus" than when I was watching it from far away, and I saw myself, surrounded with my notion of the universe, as super super tiny. When I was coming back, I began to see the back of my head and the universe complete, in very similar sizes. But, as I was stepping into this reality again, my head and the notion of myself began to grew smaller, and the universe larger, until it took the form and size that has now. When I watched my clock, it said 2:30am, and I couldn't believe it. It was like 5 minutes for me.

This is by far one of the most beautiful experiences I've ever had. I hope to never forget the amazing places I saw and how I surrender myself to the trip, the first time of my life I gave up control entirely and met the Salvia experience entirely. I felt the plant itself, a gigantic powerful being, carrying me to show the other realities behind this one and making me understand that yes, this is one of many, many ways of perceiving and that I am much more than only one of them. It's like seeing yourself, but not you in your human form, not you in your name and in your country, in your world and in your galaxy. You, as an existing being, and nothing more. Undefinable by our common standars, by our very existance. You just are, and now you are in this frame, in this reality, but just for the moment. It's amazing.

I believe this is the right way **(FOR ME)** of doing Salvia, in the dark, alone, and without anyone watching you. Please, note that this experience was made at my own risk, and I do not reccomend anyone to try this for their first time of doing Salvia. Read and research A LOT before smoking Salvia, and if it is your first time, always do it with someone else; a sober sitter. I, in particulary, feel that being watched by my friends launching questions to me every 20 seconds and with music makes me paranoid and kind of having bad trips. I enjoyed this experience way much than my previous ones (which I also enjoyed in perspective).

**TL;DR:** Smoked Salvia 40x extract very slowly, alone, and in complete darkness. Tripped a lot, surrendered myself to the plant, and saw my very self as a part of much other existance forms. Total ego loss and understood my existance as an morphless being. Chose to come back after 2 hours and did, and now I see reality as only 1 option of perception.

Thanks for reading! If you have any questions or if you want to share some experiences, I'll try to make sure to comment on them all. Sorry if this is poorly worded; English isn't my first language. If something is sketchy please tell me and I'll try to rephrase it. 




 I want to go for the larger and less chaotic trip that smoking provides. I know that some people chew the fresh leaves and that this provides a longest and nicest trip, more controlable and enjoyable, but I don't have any.

Is there a way of cooking it or making a tea with the extract? Thanks! 




 Last week I tried it for the first time, and I loved it. It was a gram of 20X extract, and I smoked around 0.2g, with a water bong and a torch lighter. I loved the experience, it was pretty harsh coming back, but looking back at it, it was amazing. So amazing that I smoked again that same night, a few hours later, and loved it again.

Now I have 1 gram of 40x extract, and I'm probably going to smoke some today with my SO. The thing is, tomorrow I'm going to my friend's house, the one who has the 20x extract, and we're probably going to smoke as well that day. He sure is, I will see how I feel in the moment.

But, if I decide to, is there any risk for my health? I know there's no OD with this plant, but being the psychedelics effects so strong, can it damage me in any way?

Thanks!


EDIT: Hey guys! Many many thanks for all the responses. I didn't smoke today though, but tomorrow I will. I will keep track of how I'm feeling when I repeat the experience, sadly there's little to no information about this plant but everything seems to point that no risk is involved. I'm going to explore it with care and measure anyways, and I'll keep you guys informed if anything off happens.

Again, thanks a lot for the comments! They were of real help.
 









 Instagram clearly refuses to add another format than 1:1, but now Facebook (again, because they did this in the past but then removed it) is forcing people to crop 1:1 their new profile photos. It just sucks.

I just don't understand why is this. Can someone tell my why social networks are choosing to force people to 1:1, and if some other sites are using it as well? Of course you can add edges to your pic, but that decreases the size and therefore the quality of the picture when zoomed.

Thanks in advance.

no BULLSHIT, JUST [10] AMA 














 Well, this is my first post in /r/nosleep. I hope I'll be able to express myself well, since English isn't my first language.         

I was thinking, almost meditating, about distances between us people, and how the technology now easily available in every home allows us to connect us and debate instantly about ideas and conceptions. That's admirable, and it's something to remember and charish. Let's not take it for granted.          

But also, on the other hand, at the same time a lot of people can not access to this technologies and therefore is marginated from that community, geting behind in human evolution pace. And, a lot of them can not tell us their realities such as we can, and must be in dark places and needing our help, but without getting it. And it made me sad, to think of all those people, departed from their beloveds, kidnapped girls, war prisoners, war victims in the middle east, everyone and everything that you love, gone.                

And that made me wonder about my beloved ones, my house, my things. My life. What if, say 2 to 3 years from now, some political debate gets into a discussion, and then into an issue, and then, into a international complaint, and then, into a war. And its a war with your country, and another very threatening one. And this is ALL from a trouble that to this day, did not exist. Maybe it'll originate tomorrow, but, there's a chance that in 3 years, you will be in that situation.                                            

With your beloved ones gone. Imagine your neighrhood, destroyed, your family killed brutally by bombs and bullets of high .cal, your sons and brothers, and fathers, burned and mutilated. Imagine them, with their faces and their voices gone. You knowing that you wouldn't see them anymore, hear them anymore, hug them anymore. Feel them anymore, not ever again. Your pets, all killed as well, you and a few people you know and members of your family survived, but the hunt isn't over yet and you may be the next victim. Or your left beloved ones.                

So, this is something that seems far from true, and we say ourselves that it doesn't actually seems like something that could happen, so, I'm tranquile and I sleep well that way, not thinking about it. But, it could, it HAS, it IS (in other country, to people like you and me), in it WILL BE in some point, another great war.                                

It may not be violent war, with bombs, nukes and airplanes, it could be a echonomical war, which then ends in you and your family in poverty, dying from hunger and great recesion, or a civic war, or I don't know. We, as humans, know that in time, shamefully it's going to happen.                

And now, us that can seen it before it happening, need to do something. But we can't. It's not up to us.                  
 

It's NOT up to us. It's up to THEM.               


And THEY will decide if its your country's turn, my country's turn, or someone else's country turn. We just have to wait and... see.            

*Keep a good ear for the bangs and booms.*       


EDIT: a word  




 Time when you don't smoke weed to avoid or dimish tolerance to THC 









 Ever since Season 1, when they're about to kill Eddard I was thinking "OK, he's going to get saved, obviously, any moment now... any moment... wait... what?", and so I learned that this show is not like any other show, or books for that matter.

What I mean is that I never expected to so much main characters to die, and this is something positive for me, because although I do not wish them to die, but to win and live happy forever (well, not quite, but you get my point), I enjoy the thrill of fights and challenges the characters face, because now I know that they CAN die. In any other shows, they won't die, they will only get CLOSE to dying and they'll be saved in the last second, and you get the thrill of suspense in fights and the not knowing, but you kinda expect that they will end up victoriously. But not here.

For example, when I watched last night's episode (S04E09), I was tense through the whole thing, and that's because Martin isn't afraid to kill a main character. I knew Jon could die any moment there, it was a real possibility, and that filled me with excitment. Again, I wanted him to "win" and that things ended well, and that's the same reason why I got so hyped up: because I knew the chance of that not happening was a real thing.

I like this feature a lot. It's like a double edged sword: on one hand, I get to see the characters for which I developed certain amount of affection get slaughtered, but on the other, I get the thrill and excitement of death and the "bad guys winning".

Sorry for bad english!

I think I would try that, just out of curiosity. 














 A friend of mine is starting to play LoL, so I created a new account to play along with him. We duoqueued (LVL 5 and 8 accounts), and we played like 10 or 12 games. This was just about now.


We lost most of these games, but not because of him being new, but because EVERYONE else was smurfing. And I mean, heavy smurfing. I was smurfing too of course, but I wasn't playing like full-hardcore-commando-faker. I'm very surprised of the quantity of people smurfing in low levels.

 What do we mean when we talk about positive and negative charges, such as in protons and electrons? How is there a negative value for energy?

 I read once here on Reddit that diabetic people are told to inyect water on oranges so they can practice before inyecting themselves with insulin, and one time a doctor/nurse saw a person with this disease on the ER with ridiculous high sugar levels on their blood.        

They were inyecting the oranges with the insulin and then eating them.

 The state holds them (properties and money) until they're 18. 









 Yes. In my district, there is a "consejal" (I'm sorry, I wouldn't know how to name this position in english, it's a helper and a votant on the choices our mayor takes) that's currently 18, but has been since the age of 16.

It's nepotism (mayor's son) and utterly corruption, but almost nothing isn't it anymore around here. 




 I could own a house, and drive a car when I was 16 in Canada...
16 is when you get your G1... sure you need someone in the car with you but you can drive one.. and there is no legal age limit on how old someone has to be to own a house.. a 2 year old could own a house if their parents put it in their name.

None of those things are legal here (Argentina). 




 Voy a escribir en espaol ya que el ingls soy malo

 




 In my country, the legal voting age is 16, and you can vote even for presidential elections. I mean, you can't own a house, drive a car, or decide if you want to drink a beer, but you get to participate in the election of politicians. It's fucked up.

 I installed "DSLR Remote" (Android), it has multiple brands of cameras and a few cool functions. 




 I was trying to fix my IR remote for my Nikon D90, with no luck. I remembered I had some radios and a cable, which I used as a remote shooter in the past, but the cable was broken and I was beggining to feel defeated.    

Then I thought that maybe my S4 Mini had a IR transmitter, and searched for an app. Found one, installed it, and thought "this won't work, I'm sure". Great was my surprise when it actually worked PERFECTLY! I now have a remote IR shooter on my smartphone. I should've realised earlier, but well. Maybe my post helps someone in a similar situation, it's super useful and pretty cool as well.

 What an incredible, gorgeous movie. I'm so glad Nolan picked up so many things from it for Interstellar. In the slight chance that someone in this subreddit doesn't know where that quote is from, it's from Contact, a film from 1997. 




 I just wanted to chip in and say that after a very intense (and arguably irresponsible) salvia trip that led me to a very similar state like OP's, I did exactly this and got better in no time. Depression kicks A LOT stronger when you aren't completely sober. As this commenter says, stay it for a while. Keeping active, forcing yourself to go out and do activities helps a lot. It's hard at first but it does help.
   
I started meditating a few days ago and I'm really enjoying it, so I recommend you OP check it out too. I don't know if it's for everybody, but I did think it wasn't for me, and I'm glad I was wrong. Look it up, it's super simple, and it may help you calm down and stay more focused.

 Thanks so much! I'm definitely going to watch this video. 




 So, I've been having some issues lately that gave me some panic attacks and constant fear, and last night my fear "peaked" and I was very paranoid about very very stupid things.    

I've been thinking about meditating for some time now, and lurked this subreddit and read a bunch of the top posts to get good info on how to do it. I started today, feeling very down, seeing very desaturated colors, and with some fear still in my heart.   

I sat in a towel, with my legs crossed, and the tip of my thumbs touching (I did as described on the #1 top post here). I concentrated on my breathing after puting the alarm for 10 minutes, and started focusing. At first, lots of thoughts came by, that meditation wasn't for me, that it will accomplish nothing, etc etc, but as I read, I contemplated the thoughts and let them flow and pass by.       
          
Later, I began to relax, and to feel good. I could see my problems with a lot of perspective, and they started to feel very solvable. This brought a smile and a feeling of happiness. Over the course of those 10 minutes, I relaxed and reached a very clear mental status. I'm now totally and utterly astonished about my experience. It served me in a great deal, and although I know this is the first step of many, just doing it makes me feel great.

I look foward to do this again tomorrow, and the day after that. And the day after that as well. I have a trip in 2 weeks, in which I'm hoping to practice this as well.          

It was beautiful and very helpful, and I wished to share that with you. Of course any tips or advice are very well welcomed.  
   
Thanks for reading :)

 Friedick Nietzsche 




 I always thought about something in particular that I'd like to share. 

We are a very, VERY new species. We're on our very infancy; if we took all the time Earth has existed and compressed it in 24 hours, civilization exists about 4 miliseconds before midnight. Let alone speak about our time since the Universe itself exists. We, in the cosmic scale, exist for no more than a fraction of the blink of an eye.   

Yet, we have done so much things. We've traveled to our distant moon, and layed pieces of ourselves in other planets. We have already begin to explore our solar system, in so little time.  

What do all things alive want? What's the ultimate instinct of all species? To STAY alive. If you bear that in mind, and also that we have existed for so litte, you'll see that we have yet to evolve a awful lot. I think we'll get to a point in which we'll learn that the best way to survive, is to coopearte with each other. Now, I see that happening in a lot of time, maybe millions of years, but I definitely see that as a real possibility. I believe once we've achieved that point, in which we only wish to survive as a whole species, progress is going to be made a lot, lot faster. We're not as intelligent as we could be, and we know that. Killing ourselves is not the best way to coexist, and maybe one day we'll get pass that. 


Now, if you take into account all these things that I said, maybe we could exist for much much longer, and achieve an understanding of spacetime beyond our dimensions. Maybe we'll discover a form of fuel that lets us travel a lot faster and a lot cheaper. Maybe in a long time we'll be able to actually go to other galaxies, to bend and stretch the dimensions of spacetime to our likehood. It's a possibility that I like to imagine. 

This is why I think it is actually possible to know other civilizations, to enter other galaxies, to spread our species accross the universe. There's also the chance that before that, we annihilate ourselves in the next 500 years, but I like to believe otherwise. Maybe I'm just a fool, or naive, but maybe this isn't so crazy after all.

 An outside observer would never witness you cross the horizon, as you approached, you'd slow down and any light emitted would redshift to zero

How long would this take?
 




 We would never see something going into a black hole, right? It would take infinite time from our perspective to see say a planet or a star get sucked it, because of time dilation. So, how is it that we observe they grow?  




 What if we 'faked' gravity using centrifugal force?

Look, I just snapped this upvote with my 10mm lens inverted. It's really fun to make macros with this technique: http://i.imgur.com/46bocpu.jpg 




 Yes! 35mm is a great focal lenght for achieving this. Make sure you open the diaphragm a bit (not fully open). You can do this by sliding to the sides a little metal piece in the back of the lens, which controls the aperture. 




 This is a Nikon 50mm f/1.8 lens inverted on a Nikon D90. 

Inverting lenses that are in the range of normal-wide gives you an incredible amplification and you can get really good macros with it. The 18-55mm and the 18-105mm that come as a kit in basic reflex are great for doing this, at 18mm you get CRAZY magnification.  




 Haha, indeed it does. Thanks! 




 The guy's just saying her that he wants more, because it hurts having her only as a bootycall (or sorts). That fucking bitch posts this man's pain on Facebook and laughs at it, what the fuck?

 I agree 100% with you on this one. I may get downvoted because of this comment (I'm stating no opinion or contributing discusable material on the subject) but I just sincerily felt my upvote wouldn't cut it, and felt the need to put it in words.  




 I drink beer often, and smoke weed even more regulary. I think it's most because spilling weed feels worst than spilling beer, because of what "it represents" (in terms that weed is more expensive and more difficult to get because of its legal status than beer).

Also, and I'm not saying you're stating this (other comments above are), I don't see why saying you do drugs is a synonim of looking for attention. They're forbidden, yes, but at what point? Beer and marijuana are among the easiest accesible drugs for everyone. The social judgement of them has changed so much that doing them isn't seen as rebellion anymore (weed may be a little more arguable at this point though). I don't think stating that you smoke weed is looking for attention. Sure, lots of teenagers and stupid adults do, but I think they're a minority among drug users.  




 Wow, that's incredible. Totally going to try that at home!
