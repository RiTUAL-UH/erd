 I know that the typical response to this is that I should wait for the games to possibly go on sale as a flash, daily or community deal but the fact of the matter is that it is winding down. 
  
What are some good games that have yet to, or won't, be featured that people should get?  
  
.

.

Some examples would be: FUEL and "The Last Remnant" for the former is good with the refueled mod and the latter is an older game.

I am not looking for anything in particular but general suggestions. 









 This is the start of the second season after the recap of the first two seasons last episode.

This is the world where Shinku selected, "Do not wind" and he is now in college while his other self, in another timeline, asks him for help. 




 This seems to be an alternate take on the series. We see Shinku and Sugintou show up which seems similar to the first series.
What are your thoughts?

Also, the ~desu begins. Semi-Official "desu" count: 14

I recently finished the game and I was wondering what people did at the very end of game when you go into the room with the doctors. They were, seemingly unarmed, but after all one had been through what did you do and why did you do it? 




 This is a MASSIVE (42,000+) batch of hits. It does require a qualification hit that pops up every once and a while. Almost perfect TO! 

http://adf.ly/R7ZuG (You should be able to find the qualification hit here too as it is just a search for the requester name) As of this time, the qualification hit is not up.

I have done about 300+ from them and they all approved! 




 Near perfect TO. http://adf.ly/QnGc4

I got a pretty good bonus from them!

 **What is it?**

The app is called Tooyoou and it is currently in open beta which uses some of your homescreen to send you ads. Here is a [link](http://tooyoou.com/howitworks) to the site where it explains how it works.

**How do I earn?**

You earn by installing the application and having a widget on your homescreen. In this widget, they will show various ads that do not have any sound or distracting flashing. If you click on each new ad that comes through that is setup to pay for clicking on it you earn $0.10 and you seem to get about half a cent through just having it shown. 

**What are some caveats?**

The main issue that I could find is that it could be a big data hog so I would suggest using it when you are on Wifi or on an actual unlimted plan. I, personally, do not know how it impacts battery life for I am using an old android phone which is always plugged in.

**How fast can you earn?**

Personally, I just joined the application and in the span of about ten or so minutes I have earned $0.62. It rotates a new ad every ten minutes or if you do any of the following:

	Connectivity to data or wireless network has changed.

	You have checked your account balance.

	You have saved your preferences using Your Choice.

**What is this Your Choice?**

It is their way of having targeted ads pointed your way. What you do is state your general age, gender and interests thus the ads will change accordingly. It is optional and only if you want to see targeted ads.

**How can you get paid?**

It appears that you can be paid once a month through Paypal. You must have a pending balance of $5.00 for it to send the money to your Paypal account. You can also download apps to earn points but I do not know the point to dollar ratio for you must have 2500 points to get a gift card. From the website where I found out about the application, the poster claimed that they have been using it for five or so months and have gotten about $450 from it all. I, personally, cannot vouch for this amount of earning for I am quite new to it. I am mainly submitting it here so that other people can find out about it.

**Where can I find this application?**

You can find it on the Google Play Store under the title Tooyoou or at this [link.]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tooyoou.android hl=en)

**Is there a referral system?**

Not that I could find! Good luck in earning! 









 **What is "Digital Generation"?**

It is a software program is one that works through distributed computing. Thankfully, you will always get the same amount per day no matter the computer regardless of the overall processing speed. You do have to download their software, but you can just run it in the background. I haven't had an impact on performance or anything of that sort. Currently, it is running any only using 40MB of my RAM, much less than that of a web browser or most other software.
  
**What is this I see about $50 a thread?**

To earn money, you have to have a thread open to use. Each thread gives you $1 per day if the computer is on for 24 hours.  

**Well crap, I do not want to pay! How can I earn?**

To get a trial thread (30 Days), you must provide a cell phone number for them to send a SMS to. If you do not get a SMS, just send a ticket to the admin by clicking on the "Tickets" tab.  

**What if I do not want to send them my cell phone number?**

You can do what I did and use a Google Voice number. This requires a Google account and you can access it at [voice.google.com](http://voice.google.com) and it is free if you are in the US or Canada.  

**How do you get paid?**
You can get paid through any of the following:

* Paxum
* Perfect Money
* Payza
* Paypal ~ NOT YET! Slated to be added by/on June 15^th  

**Do you have any payment proof?**

No, I am fairly new to the site, but when submitting a ticket the admin seemed professional and quick to respond to my problem.

**How can I sign up?**

You can either sign up through my [referral](https://coingeneration.com/auth/new/100685/) or through this [non-ref link](https://coingeneration.com).


Even if you do not pay for a thread, you can earn up to $30.00 in a month through a purely passive method. 









 I am asking this, for I am wonder how people manage to stay sane on a plane for 12+ hours straight. I know of the in-flight entertainment, but how do you manage to pass the time?  

My reason for this is that I will be flying from the east coast of the US to Japan next year. This is not my first international flight, for I went from the same area to England and flew back from France but that was about ten years ago. (I am headed to Japan with a college class for two weeks.) 




 This time we get to see what happens when Misaka meets one of her clones.

What are your thoughts on the episode? 









 Finally a Hinagiku episode and all that it entailed.

What are your thoughts on the episode? 



















 I'm a Christian (Non-demonational), but I was wondering what God said about those who visit other, supposedly, sacred sites. I am asking this because it seems as though I will be traveling to Japan in May of 2014 and during the course of the trip, we will end up visiting a shinto shrine or two. (The course I am taking the trip with is about the culture of Japan.)
 














 Things other than a biological cycle. 









 Great episode, it is interesting to see the dynamic about how the crowd on Akibastar reacted to their return. I wonder how they are going to pull it off in terms of regaining ground next episode.     
    
  









 With Zetsuen no Tempest and my fondness for classical, I was wondering if there were any other anime out there that were entirely or 95% orchestral.

My MAL: http://myanimelist.net/animelist/bookkid900 



















 We finally find out that Manami did not pass the audition and some good character development for Ryuunosuke. 




 https://www.mturk.com/mturk/searchbar?selectedSearchType=hitgroups searchWords=hubpages minReward=0.00 x=-935 y=-89

This is the screening test for the "HubPages" batch hits. When you complete the "Request Qualification" information you can begin to work on these 15 hits. Each are about a minute or less in length and pay $0.25. If you pass the screening test you receive a bonus of $10. If you almost pass you receive a bonus of $2.

Once you pass, you can begin to work on the main hubpages hits. Depending on your accuracy you can be paid anywhere from $0.20 to $2.60 extra for every ten hits that you complete.

**EDIT: It seems as though you guys killed the screening test hits.** 




 What do you think the PS4 will cost at launch? 









 We get to see a number of important things this episode:
 
1. Mimori is the new Mariko
1. There are hints of "Mariko" becoming a sadist. (It could be Tsubasa or Mimori since they have both had the same name.)
1. The Photographer is a spy.
1. The conditions for the "Center Nova" phenomenon:
 * A concert with combat
 * An atmospheric disturbance
 * Large quantities of high-purity dualium crystals.
1. The group will be attacked on their home turf next episode. 

What are your thoughts? 




 I recently discovered this trick because I routinely get shocked trying to open the door to my bathroom. Since the metal takes the shock, you do not get the pain from the discharge.

**NOTE:** Do NOT use a key that has a button on it! The discharge may cause problems for the internal circuits! 














 This was a pretty good episode. We were able to see the resolve of the three main girls in going forth with their plan even when almost no one showed up to their concert. Also, this is probably the starting point for the rest of the group to be formed for the girls who were in the OP/ED were all at the concert at the end of the song.

What are your thoughts on the episode? 




 I forgot that this game was coming out until I saw it on Amazon.com it looks really good. The two major reviews that are out are giving really high marks to it and it sounds like you can spend a lot of time playing it. Personally, I am a fan of anime so the graphics and general aesthetic is towards my interests. Also, I like JRPGs and the like too. 




 You do not have the provide context but it would be appreciated. 

Names are not important for it is the words that they have spoken/written that matter in this case.

Preferably, it would not be from someone famous or well known. 









 Why do some games have an open community for new players while others are hostile? What makes players tick a certain way?


The thing that prompted this was that I started to play "Go" online and the people I have met there have been more than willing to help me progress and learn. Why can't other video games take this openness and run with it? Everyone starts out where they are no good at said game whether it is on a console/PC or offline.
 









 I am looking at possibly getting a 3DS or saving for a next gen console (Wii U or PS4). I already have a PS Vita and have been playing that off and on.

In terms of games, I have a whole bunch of DS games from years ago. If I were to get a 3DS, I would also look at eventually getting Paper Mario, MK 7, SM3DL, LoZ:OOT, NSMB2 and maybe Pokemon Black Ver. 2 since I haven't played a pokemon since yellow edition.

Thing is, I do not know how the third party support will be for the console since the games that I am looking at are all first party... 




 This could be anything from a reference to some background characters without any voice having a story of their own. 









 **EDIT: Today, December 25th, the credits are being slow and may not show up until later today!**



First off, many of you may already know about this site and such, but this is for those who do not or who were not able to use it prior to this Christmas.

There is a site called "freemyapps" and what they do is pay you credits that you can redeem for gift cards and the like. You do not have to pay for any of the apps, unlike some other sites of this type. Their payout rate is 300 credits = $1. Some apps may be worth up to 450 credits though they hover at about 160ish. **NOTE:** It seems as though the Android apps are paying, on average, about 100 per download and are lower than that of iOS users.

To get the points, you go to the site, then you download the app from clicking on the link. That will then take you to the App Store / Play Store for you to download the application. Once it is downloaded and installed you have to open it for at least 30 seconds. It can be a bit finicky so just check after about 45 seconds or so. 

Personally, I wish that I had found the site sooner for I have been able to earn about $15 on amazon from them in the span of three days. (This has been paying more than mTurk, Swagbuck and Bing and in less time.) [PROOF](http://i.imgur.com/ISmKY.jpg)

NOTE: They install a "profile" which assigns your device ID or phone to an account but you do not have to provide a name or address for it.

Here are the links: [Non-Ref](http://m.freemyapps.com) | [Ref](http://m.freemyapps.com/share/url/b86f2818) 

**NOTE:** You must open the above links on your iOS/Android apps.  




 I am looking into getting PDf off of Amazon soon and I am wondering what you guys/girls think about the game. (I have played the previous ones on my PSP) Also, I have never imported anything before so I do not know what to expect. 









 https://www.mturk.com/mturk/searchbar?selectedSearchType=hitgroups searchWords=Victoria+Shaffer minReward=0.00 x=0 y=0

Took me about 6.5 minutes to complete.

Excellent TO.

No AC or MC. 














 Another great episode, this time focusing on Aika and Mahiro's relationship as remembered by Mahiro's dreams. In terms of plot progression, there wasn't a lot but it shows the lengths that the two took to hide their relationship. 

What are your thoughts? 




 If possible, I would be interested in seeing the data that my time on Reddit has created. Odds are my top subreddit would be /r/anime, so if it is something different it would cool to know what it is. 









 I, personally, really like it but I feel that the timing window is too small. You cannot have the same timing window as the main game on this mode. For, there can be too much on the screen to accurately see the patterns. (I mainly play 7 key) 




 I have been using the ATH-M50 headphones for about a year and a half now, but even since getting a DAC (The Audioengine D1) I've realized that there is more to hear that these headphones cannot fully reproduce. What would be a good headphone to go to from here?

**Budget:** Max of $400.00 (Though if there is something that is slightly above that amount it should be fine.)

**Usage:** I plan on using them on my computer to watch videos and listen to music. I am in a dorm so some isolation would be good and I have to travel to home on breaks.

**What do I listen to?** - I listen to anything from Jazz to Rock (Not Metal) to Classical. (I do not listen to R B or Rap)

I am looking for headphones that can accurately reproduce the recorded sound rather than adding in extra bass. 




 Wow, I was not expecting that reaction at the end of the episode from Komari. I liked the touch where the flashback at the end was mainly instrumental with only the phrase spoken by her brother as "This was all a dream".

What are your thoughts on this episode? 




 Has anyone else come across someone with a PAX icon next to their name when you look at them? I'm assuming that this means that they visited the booth at PAX. 
 




 For those of us that use Bing rewards, they are doubling the number of points today for searches. Whether or not it will be like thing until halloween is beyond me.

If you have yet to sign up for Bing rewards, it is a simple way to earn a little bit of money on the side. You can get, normally, up to 15 points a day by searching on Bing but today it is up to 30.

To sign up for bing: [non-ref](http://www.bing.com/rewards) | [ref](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9778718 rrid=_494e93a3-713d-1529-7052-79d2a1f0330c

 I have never played a Persona game before, but I keep on seeing this game popup across the web. I do like a good JRPG, but I am worried that the enemies would be too frightening to be able to play it. The Japanese setting and such won't bother me so that is a non-issue. I would rather buy golden than the PS2 version because I have a vita. Also, since it is portable I'd be able to play it on the go.

Thanks in advance! 














 In my case, it would have to be during my Sci-Fi and Philosophy course last semester. The teacher brought up [Innocence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY-A0Bt1fUg feature=plcp) after showing the tupac chochella thing. (It was to show how that, the tupac thing, was not entirely new but this type of thing is starting to occur.)

As predicted, everyone else in the class was freaking out thinking that this was extremely weird. Though in my case, I was just wanting to remember the song title to look it up later. 




 If anyone had an extra Civ V game from their Xcom preorder gift and would like to give it away, I would be more than glad to use it. 




 Great episode to start this off. Some pretty good comedy and weird/random parts. The Konami code (Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A) [Note: They left out the start...] for the vending machine was pretty funny.

Art wise, it seems to be a simpler but still detailed style when compared to Hyouka.

Your thoughts? 














 It took about a month from submitting it to it actually getting here, but it was worth it. The magnets are valued at $38.24 on their website. The case is well made, but I have yet to open it. 









 If you have a video link, please post it! 









 Gifts do not count.


In my case, it would have to be the Clannad:The Complete Collection. I would have gotten Toradora, but I am waiting it out in hopes that NISA will eventually release the bluray version in the states. 




 My story/example:

I am helping move in freshmen at my university and we had to get here early. Before one of the prep tasks that we had to do, I was coming out of lunch and someone was playing the OP to After Story on the Steinway piano up near the gym/starbucks. I ran up there and listened to him play for a while and said something about Clannad. He just laughed and started to play the OP to the first season. Meanwhile, there is a freshman's mom sitting near by bobbing her head to the music and I doubt that she knew that it was from an anime.  




 There have to be some interesting stories out there regarding this.

--------------


**My story**:


My university has an on campus steakhouse and it is part of your meal plan. As such, since the meal plan resets every week, you can go once a week. Being the person that I am, I wanted to take advantage of this for all that it is worth. 

A few months pass since starting my freshman year and I had gone every single week. Most of the time I was alone, so I would sit at the bar like area of the steakhouse and talk to the waiters and waitesses. One of the waiters, a gentleman who I guess to be in his mid to late fifties, knew that I was a Computer Science major and asked me if I had ever heard of Reddit. I answered no and went on with my meal. Later that night, I went on to Reddit and saw somethings that I'd rather not see and got off. 

A few more months pass and I was asked again by the very same waiter if I had gone on. I said that I did, but ran into somethings that I'd rather not see. He just chuckled and stated that I should give it another shot. Well, I did as such and here I am.

**TL;DR** Was told about Reddit from an older waiter at the on campus steakhouse. 









 I am new to turking, and I am wondering how long it normally takes for you for the HIT to go from Approved - Pending Payment to paid? 



















 I realize that this is requested a lot but I have seem to have run out of ones to watch. I am looking for a good comedy romance series without a lot of fanservice (Meaning no High School DxD or Maken-Ki eque series)

My current anime list is here: http://myanimelist.net/animelist/bookkid900 




 The text will state to following:

BEST - BUY CUSTOMER: You've been chosen for a 1K Reward to use at any location. To claim go to [WEBSITE REDACTED]   enter 9791

I just got one of these and nothing other than a whois leading to some building in LA comes up when searching for the website. 














 Some examples of this would have to be:
 * Mahou Sensei Negima
 * Hayate no Gotoku
 * The World God Only Knows

I really like it when the creator of a series puts these things in so that it seems like a "Just as planned" scenario.

EDIT: Added TWGOK. 
























 With the introduction of the E3 PDf demo and its inclusion in the Sony PS Vita Sizzle Reel (See [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fEX9-LR9tg feature=player_detailpage#t=101s) ) I would like to start a discussion on the possibility of an international release of PDf.

My thoughts are that, if anything, it would be announced at Anime Expo. For, according to what I have seen on the official Hatsune Miku Facebook page, they seem to have a lot of vocaloid related things there. (I realize that vocaloid and anime go, semi, hand-in-hand with one another but this, to me, seems as though it is more than just that. )

So, /r/Vocaloid what are your thoughts on this? 
























 This was my old username on multiple sites and it would be interesting to see what people do with the 900 part of it. :D 



















 Like the question states, I'd like to know if it is possible to have the original nook that has 3G and wifi become a mobile router and provide internet for a laptop or other device? Thanks in advance! 




 We all get these times where it feels as though you have watched everything or become tired with the medium as a whole. How do you get over this "slump" or "Anime block"?

I normally, get over it by looking up recommendations online or even going back to the various charts for the various seasons of anime in the past. 














 Well, me being an idiot, I let a friend borrow my 16gb flash drive and when she returned it, Windows wants to format it to only 64MB of storage space.

Note, I have tried the following:
*  HP USB Format Tool
*  Bootice
*  Disk Management (Windows)

At this rate, I am willing to boot into linux and fit it over there... 









 I have heard a lot of good things about "The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky" but I do not know whether or not to get that or get Disgaea 3 when it comes out on Tuesday.

 I have loved SRPGs since I played about 25 hours worth of Final Fantasy Tactics A2 on my DS many years ago. 

Also, I have about 60 or so in my PSN account, though I am trying to save 15 for Tony Hawk Pro Stater HD... Though, if you guys/girls state that I need to get both, then it is possible to do so. 



















 I am using g++ to compile C++ code for a project for school and I am getting, without quotes, "goodie.cpp:(.text+0xc): undefined reference to 'create()' "

 I saw the post about someone getting scammed by using a similar username. (The old seeing "nn" as "m" when you glance at it) This way it won't get buried in comments and people can see it.

How to avoid getting scammed:

1. Download [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com)

2. See the person who you are getting pizza for and tag their username. (Or even do it by setting a color for their username!)

3. Use that tag to make sure the PM's line up. 

4. ???

5. Pizza. (For the correct person!)

 I know that this is a weird question but as I was taking a shower yesterday I had the thought of, "How in the world do things dry out without extra heat? Because water, in order to become a gas needs to reach 212F or 100C. I realize it is due to evaporation but how does it occur?" 














 I remember my dad playing this game a long time ago (1998ish) and I cannot remember the name of it. I do remember the following:
* It had a "boss" type thing that was a round cylinder that rotated and spewed fireballs.
* You had to fly around a pick up keys to open other rooms with keys.

It scared me as a kid and now I want to beat the game to get my "revenge". 









 Back in October I got this email:

-----------------------------------
Note: I removed the links and hid my channel's link so that it doesn't seem that I am doing it for ad revenue. 

Also, the video in question only had 5,000 views while another at the time that I had that went semi-viral back in 2010 had about 150k. 





























 My guess is that it will air in January. I've noticed over the past six or so years of watching currently airing anime that the vast majority of the time when they announce a show it is one full season away from airing. 

The actual explanation of this is that they do not want to lose the hype from the fanbase for the second season by making them wait. Yes, there are some outliers such as Grisaia (Which is finally airing this season) and Dog Days''' (Airing this January) both of which were announced years ago. 




 For those of you who are "out of the loop", [have a look at this](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/23hraj/ghandi_nukes_and_civilization_v/) which explains the above comments. 




 As a heads up, mentioning illegal streaming/downloading sites is the same as linking them and it is not allowed in the rules. Any and all posts mentioning these types of sites will be removed. 




 [They knew all along.](http://brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/2008/07/11/050-gooey-kablooie/) 




 How about Toradora? It is regarded as a really good romance/comedy anime. 




 Most apps don't unless you press a button to bring it up. 




 Considering that there are only five characters in the demo it should be a 20% chance, but I agree that it tends to prefer certain characters. 




 Thing is, he returns nothing as he is void. 




 I got it for them, but I hope people remember to tag their posts. (It could have also been someone submitting it from an app and they haven't seen the sidebar yet.) 




 They went over that by saying, "How would you explain this to them?". 




 That was the PS3. The PS3 used the cell architecture which was new for the PS3, this is what made it hard for valve.

The PS4, on the other hand, uses a 64 bit architecture and the OS is a certain distro/version of linux. Valve has been pouring a lot into putting their games, and others, on Linux. (What do you think SteamOS is?)
 




 According to the first season, she is a college student. I am not sure why she looked younger in the first season, other than she is short. 




 Getting the "internet" to agree on something is like trying to herd cats, it just isn't going to happen. 




 Not only that but it has a new OP and ED song and animation. It would be a bit silly to make something new when they could just reuse the old versions. My guess is that they are looking for sales of the blu-ray version to help spur a second season. 




 It seems interesting. I wish it was scaned/translated. 




 Now go read the novels. (You can buy them in English! Well, not all of them but they are translating all of them!)
 




 I've had the opportunity to meet him and he seems to be nice but reserved. He did kick my butt in Melee though. (4 stock against me.) 




 Not only that but you can shorten it to what you did.

 Please properly mark your spoilers using the spoiler tag rather than "WARNING! SPOILERS!". The proper spoiler tag is in the sidebar. (IF you can't read the sidebar for some reason it would be: [(Ep.1)]-(#s "Pikachu") Without the dash between the brackets and the parenthesis.  




 You think they would test a random bloodstain for DNA or something. (Then again, they probably don't have a record of Hime's DNA) 




 If you don't get it, "lead" has multiple meanings, most people would think of the verb not the noun in this case.

 Something something Peach problem. 




 90 degrees - There you go, an angle. :P 




 True story: My weekend has been horrible so far, and I'm not talking about not getting a code or anything.  
My computer broke because the bootloader got corrupted. Even reinstalling Windows didn't fix the issue! Getting a code would make my weekend since I was unable to try and get a code otherwise.

 Could someone please send me a code? This weekend has been horrible so far. My computer broke, for the bootloader got corrupted. Even reinstalling Windows didn't fix the issue. Getting a code would make my weekend. I can provide proof that my computer is broken with a picture of my computer showing the error and my username on a post-it note.

 My second favorite "genre" or trope of sorts is when someone gets sent to an alternate world where they have to either try and survive or figure out a way back.

Some notable anime examples:

* [Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5781/Isekai_no_Seikishi_Monogatari)
* [Oda Nobuna no Yabou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11933/Oda_Nobuna_no_Yabou)
* [Monaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara kuru Sou Desu yo?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15315/Mondaiji-tachi_ga_Isekai_kara_Kuru_Sou_Desu_yo)
* [Outbreak Company](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19369/Outbreak_Company)

A notable manga:

* [Gate: Thus the JSDF Fought There](http://myanimelist.net/manga/41733/Gate:_Jieitai_Kanochi_nite_Kaku_Tatakeri)

Not exactly necessary, but I would like some romance/comedy aspect(s) to it.

[Here](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/bookkid900) is a link to my MAL. It is a little out of date, but most of what I have seen is on there. 




 Full List - The ones in bold are some of my must watch anime.

* The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya
* Nyoron Churuya-san
* Good Luck! Ninomiya-kun
* Kiddy GiRL-AND
* **Lucky Star**

* *The Mystic Archives of Dantalian - Heard good things, but I haven't seen it myself.*
* Otogi-Soushi (Manga 2.5) 




 Testing automod settings. 














 A bit of an odd question but I thought I should ask it here. My Mother, who is an elementary school media specialist (as she teaches more than just books), is looking to get a few series for the library. These would be, mainly, for fourth and fifth graders.

I know Shounen Jump would be a good place to start but even then some of the content could be iffy.

There are other graphic novels (not manga) in the library but I do not know what ones. 

Possible ideas: Azumanga Dioh, Yotsuba! 




 I came across a thread on GameFaqs that you can use a DAC on the PS4 by just plugging it in. 

I tried it for myself and it worked! (Quite well too.) I am unsure of whether or not you have to change the audio output to bitstream, which I did before trying, but it worked.


I tried the Audioengine D1 but I would imagine that others would work too.

---

You may be asking yourself, why does the PS4 have this and not mp3/flac/wav/ogg support? My guess is that since the PS4's OS is based off of linux they kept the drivers needed for this to work. (Heck, it is probably part of the kernel) 




 . 




 I've made up my mind to get the HD650's but I saw that people recommended getting a DAC/amp for them. I *already own* the Audioengine D1 but I was wondering how well the two go together and if it has enough power to run the HD650's. (The D1 is also an amp) 









 I normally sit in the chat of a group that I am in, along with ~10-20 others, which makes it into a sort of IRC thing. 

The issue is that for the past few days every single link except for youtube.com and steampowered.com results in having to [click through Steam's website](https://i.imgur.com/8yWhm3z.png) to get to the actual link. Even imgur is being affected by this.

I only click links I trust and from people I know. I just want it to stop as it adds anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds extra loading time. (Having to load the page, click the button, wait for the actual site to load.) When you normally click anywhere from 10 to 15 links or more a night it adds up to be quite a bit of time. 




 I bought Contraption Maker ($15 value) and it, apparently, comes with a copy to give to someone. Since the game gave me a second copy, each copy is worth $7.50 so I'm just asking for a $5 amazon gift card. (Paypal and Bitcoin are also options)

If you ever played the old Incredible Machine series, this is in the same vein and it is even made by some of the people who worked on that series. 

This trade will occur through Steam since it is a gift.

 This is a song from the newest episode of "Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun" in which one of the characters is renowned for their singing voice. The song seems to be in Italian. 

The show provided a glimpse of the [sheet music](https://i.imgur.com/yO7qni3.jpg), which I have turned into a [MIDI file](https://mega.co.nz/#!g5plQapA!B7nxW6wSOAWdcOCbSk_G7jhn5EtL0oq7Hy63Kqpuwsw) and it matches her singing.

 I have an old HP Touchpad running Cyanogenmod (Android 4.0.4) but in the Google Play Store, it states that the current version does not support this device. I know from looking around online that the HP Touchpad works for perktv and I would like to get it running on it. 
 



















 OP of the [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/27sw0l/introducing_rumble_make_videos_and_get_paid/) here with an update on my payment status.

Initially, I thought that you were paid on the Friday of the week that you requested but that is not the case. Once you "Cash out" they pay you the Friday AFTER you do so. Also, the minimum cash out is $50.

I had a video get approved and I was paid $125 two weeks ago. I was paid on June 20th. (It just turned midnight here) 

[Here is my proof from Paypal.](http://i.imgur.com/FxhYjX7.jpg) 




 I feel as though I have seen most if not all of the entire comedy/romance genre that is geared towards guys. I try to avoid shows with gratuitous fan service (DxD, etc...).

Some examples of ones I really enjoyed:

* Toradora
* Clannad 
* White Album 2
* Seitokai no Ichizon
* True Tears

[Here is my MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/bookkid900)

To help slim down and make is easier to find what ones I have seen, I also have a list of just Comedy/Romance shows [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ah64P40sBB2KdHYxQ0N6QmNlenZHLW8xaFNiZWRsQmc output=html) (It is on Google Docs) 




 I am trying to setup PerkTV on my old Droid X2 running CM10 Alpha 3 but none of the actual videos play. The ads do, but none of the ones that result in points.

I was getting the android.process.media error and I did a factory restore prior to this.

What can I do to get this to work? 














 This is a site I came across and decided to give it a try. I uploaded a [video](https://rumble.com/v2z7i1-the-worlds-busiest-intersection.html) that I had to the site last night and I got an [email](http://i.imgur.com/hxTH9oa.png) today stating that I received $125 for that video.

 **What is Rumble?**

It is a video hosting site, much like YouTube and Vimeo, but they have partners such as MTV, Xbox, MSN, Yahoo, etc.. As such they are paying users to submit their videos for them to then use on and with these partners. If your video is approved, you get $50 but if your video is good enough to be put on the front page they will pay you $100+.

---

**How can I earn money on Rumble?**  
There are four different ways for you to monetize your video(s):

 * **Profit Sharing** - You give all rights to Rumble and earn 90% of the earnings on YouTube and 60% of the earnings from their partners.  
 * **Exclusive** - You give all rights to Rumble and can make up to $1000.
 * **Non-Exclusive** (This is what I did) - You keep your rights to your video and can make up to $500. This grants Rumble a non-exclusive license to your video. (ie. They can still use it with their partners, but you still own it.)
 * **Not for Sale** - Who'd want to do that?

--

**What is Rumble looking for in a video?**

* Good title and description  
 * They changed my title and description, but make sure it is a good one such that the editors know what it is about.
* *Original content*
* High Quality Video (ie. Something that looks nice rather than thrown together.)

---
**What if I don't have any videos to upload?**  

 * You can make about $0.25 a day through tagging videos. (5 videos a day at $0.05 per)  
 * You could always make a video to upload.

 First off, I have been looking at getting a Wii U for a few months now and have saved up money on Amazon to get it.
---
---
In terms of next-gen consoles, I already have a PS4. This is what I will use for most multi-platform games.


Last year I got the 3DS and I loved being able to play the new Mario and Zelda games along with titles such as Fire Emblem, Rune Factory 4 and Mario Kart 7.  

I really want to get Mario Kart 8 which in turn will allow me to get WW:HD for free and to get the new Smash Bros down the road, but I am not sure if these games warrant a $300 console.  
--

Wii U games I am looking at getting: 

* New Zelda (The one to be announced at E3)
* New Super Mario/Luigi Bros U (Comes with the bundle)
* Super Mario 3D World
* Mario Kart 8
* Super Smash Bros for Wii U
* The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD (Free w/ MK8)
* Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze

With the MK8 Promotion, it has lessened the time that I have to make a decision as the free game helps.

 I am trying to change my password as I forget it but the recover password email isn't showing up. I am using gmail for my account and I have checked my spam and such to no avail.

Others seem to be having this issue but they remembered their passwords and changed it themselves... 









 Whenever I try to upvote or downvote nothing happens. I was using RES and I disabled it but the issue is still there. Not only that, but when I try to click on "Text" when making a post nothing happens. I was only able to get around it by using AlienBlue.

I am using the latest version of google chrome.

Thank you for any help that you can provide regarding this matter. 




 ~~What this does is disable external Direct X 3D rendering.~~  
~~It is another source engine trick that people use (mainly for Dota 2) to help speed up their game.~~  
~~Due to using this, my FPS has doubled.~~

~~You want to put this in your launch options in Origin.~~

~~The only caveat is that ALT+Tab-ing is slower than what it was before.~~

Apparently it does diddly squat. 














 It seems to me that the enemies are way too accurate for this sort of game, even more so for the bosses. It almost seems as though all of my deaths were cheap compared to those in Infamous 1/2.

There was a boss where I had to hang off a ledge and abuse the fact that you could fire through the ground in order to take the boss down. 




  I am the form of my sword 

 Smoke is my body and neon is my blood 

 I have created over a thousand blades 

 Unknown to Death, Nor known to Life 

 Have withstood hellfire to create many weapons 

 Yet, those hands will never hold anything 

 So as I pray, unlimited blade works.

 What does the Bible say about visiting other religion's festivals/occasions?

The reason I am asking is that I am going on a two week study abroad trip to Japan in May. While we are in Japan, there is a [big shinto festival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanja_Matsuri) that they have figured out a way for us to go see. While no one in the class will be partaking in this from a religious perspective, nevertheless we will be there. As such, I am unsure of what the Bible says to do in these sorts of situations.

Could anyone, if they are knowledgeable in this, be willing to share their thoughts on this matter? 




 I just got out of a CTF match on Rise where it seemed as though everyone else was locked to the ground while I was able to run along the corridors, above the action, getting [all six flags.](http://i.imgur.com/uWWLvPM.jpg)

The way they did the training mode was good, where it introduces wall-running before combat (where people would just leave since they think they know what they are doing) but there is little reminding people about these mechanics.

I know that after awhile, people will begin to use the wall running to their advantage but as of now it is quite silly to see a match go like that. 




 Let's see what happens today after the incident with the onsen last episode. 









 If you applied to be in the closed alpha/beta, go check your email as they are being sent out!

It should be interesting to see how the music and FPS parts are being tied together.

 While this subreddit has, somewhat, fallen by the wayside its intended purpose was to form a subreddit where those who play/mod the FUEL video game can talk about it.

All posts about other things will be removed without warning. 




 I am looking for a good JRPG that will be fun to play.

RF4: I haven't played any other games in the series, but I have played Animal Crossing. (I haven't played AC in a while)

M L: I played, and loved, Superstar Saga back on the GBA and I had Bowser's Inside Story but I never got too far in that one.

Bravely Default: This the JRPG that everyone has been hyping up for a while, especially since it has been out in Europe for awhile.

---
My experiences with JRPGs: I really like them, but after a while I either transition off to other games or get suck (like in Star Ocean on the 360/PS3). The closest that I have gotten to beating a JRPG was: Superstar Saga, Ar Tonelico: Qoga, Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door and also some of the recent Zelda games.

The only one I finished, and due to using action replay, was Final Fantasy IV for the DS. 




 I recently got into Dogecoin and I have ~10 doge that I am trying to send to Cryptsy. When I try and send the entire amount (or less for that matter) I get an error stating, "Error: Transaction creation failed". I am on the 1.4.1 release of the wallet software and it has just finished downloading about 30k block records. 

Is there anything that I can do to fix this?

------------------------------------

PS: I looked in the related subreddits guide to see if there was a tech support one and I also checked for an IRC to go on but I didn't find anything. I've also searched online for a solution to no avail. 

Hopefully this sort of post is okay here as I didn't see anything regarding it in the rules section. 




 Well, let's see what SHAFT has in store for this week as the fake couple has been formed! 














 For those of you who have been on /r/beermoney for a while, you may remember when some people came on and promised a new and better rewards/survey site. Nothing really came of it and for the past few months the subreddit, /r/MegaPoints, had been set as private.

Hopefully this means that the site will be coming to fruition in the near future.

***

**NOTE:** I am not affiliated with megapoints, I just happened to remember about it and decided to check to see if anything was new. 














 I am, currently, in the process of having the program process the data after downloading the full English Wikipedia file(s), but I do not know where it is in the grand scheme of things. 

It would be nice to have a progress bar/screen (like it had when downloading the 10Gb file) letting the user know how much longer and such it has for processing. 




 While this may seem to be a "Well, duh" thing but you cannot setup remote play on the Vita while you are on a different network. I had the correct numbers so that I could connect to it, but to no avail.

I attempted to setup remote play on my Vita using skype as my PS4 is six hours away by car and I cannot get to it until the middle of December. (Due to the reports of issues, I had my Mom set it up to make sure it all worked) 














 Will you have your PS4 shipped home or to your university? 

The reason I am asking is that I am torn between having it sent home, or if I should get it shipped here. My main concern is that it would interfere with my studying for finals. (Which start on December 6^th ) Yet, if I have it shipped home, I might be too antsy around finals about finally being able to play it.

Also, if you do respond, could you state when your finals are? 




 Subs are out! I am looking forward to see if he thinks that he is an invader or not. 









 So far, and I am about 6 minutes in, the episode is pretty good and *seemingly* better than last week's.

I found the whole *Jaws*-esque theme and the [profile picture for "god"](http://i.imgur.com/En6G8lI.jpg) in his cell phone were pretty funny. 




 I, recently, made a post on the /r/games subreddit with a link and when I looked at the vote distribution. I noticed something really weird, [I had a negative downvote.](http://i.imgur.com/yzYWBxm.png)

Well, someone must of either fixed the bug or downvoted it such that it is back to having 0 downvotes. 



















 This has been an idea of mine for a while, but I think it would be a good idea to have either on the wiki or on some image, a list of anime that are similar to other shows on television. 

This would allow people who are new to anime to find a common ground rather than having to guess and possible turned away from it.
 









 For those of you who have clicked on this and wondering what in the world I am talking about, there was a post up about a month ago about it on this subreddit. [Here is a link to that post](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1ktmvf/get_some_steady_brewfunds_seeking_privatecharter/).

TL;DR: It is a panel that asks those on the panel to respond to a question with five or more sentences. Once they read over and approve your response, they will send you a link to redeem a $25 gift card for another site where you can get gift cards ranging from Amazon to iTunes. This will happen once a month for the next year, well 11 months from this point in time.

 I have been looking into getting Tales of the Abyss for the 3DS for a little while. I have played Tales of Xillia on my PS3 and I really like it so far but I was wondering if I should get Tales of the Abyss for my 3DS. 

I really lime JRPGs but I never really seems to finish them. 


So, what are your thoughts? 


































 Heck, I would skip the work from selling the costumes and just keep on making gold and other important resources that I can then sell.  




 Okay, who put the Flintstones into anime? 




 Thing is, it is a gigantic series of shows if you decide to delve into the "Nasuverse". 

Here is /r/anime's guide on how to get into the Fate series: http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/seriesfaq-fate 




 A few things of note:

* You may want to fix your typos
* Try to keep titles consistent
* Remove the unnecessary capitalization 


A bit of a personal thing, but I cannot see Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu Season 2 being better than Toradora. Heck, the characters were worse than the first season.
  




 I hope this does well, this seems to be a shounen take on Marvel/DC comics which is really interesting.  




 Shouldn't the free space move down one? 




 Other than some OEL stuff and some light novels, the first volume of manga that I bought was Volume 1 of Nisekoi while I was in Japan. (If manga were that cheap here, I would buy a lot more of it. It was ~$4 USD instead of the $10 it would be in English)

I know why it is more in the US, but I can still gripe about it. (Licensing it, translation, redrawing, cover design changes if needed, printing, advertising, shipping, etc)  




 I thought it was centimeters. (As such 15 cm is about 6 inches, which is the length of a dollar bill) 




 For those of you wondering [this is one of the frames](http://i.imgur.com/guof8lv.jpg) that shows what they are asking about.

It almost looks like Emiya's "Trace On" ability that was shown when repairing the heater and also when strengthening the poster when he was defending against Lancer. 




 Did anyone else see [this?!?!?!](http://i.imgur.com/guof8lv.jpg) During the part where Archer is preparing his sword/arrow/drill there was a series of ~6-8 frames where it flashes Emiya's "Trace On" but it has Archer's hand/arm behind it. 

I stepped through the frames and this is the clearest one that has them both in it.

NOTE: I haven't played UBW, so I have no idea if this is of major importance. 




 Berser-car reminds me of Bowser Jr. from Super Smash Bros 4 with the small wheels, car with a face and cannon out the mouth. 




 The cigarettes would become lollipops with smoke coming out of them. 




 It is a light novel series in which each chapter is important to the story that they couldn't skip much, if any, of it. So far, there are 216 chapters out, 214 have been translated. To give the series its full worth, it would have to be a good number of episodes. (100 may be stretching it, but I would see 50+) 

The story also comprises the life of Rudeus starting from his infancy. 




 Not only that but some of the content would make it difficult to adapt. 




 Without compression, this is how it would turn out: The resolution would be 1280x720 so 345600 pixels. Since every color can be expressed by a 0-255 integer and there are three colors that comprise one pixel there are a total of 1036800 integers at a time. Considering that they can use an integer that only takes 8 bits of data (2^8 -1, which is 0-255) this means that a single frame takes up 1.037 MB. At thirty frames a second it would be 31.11 MB/s.

Now, this is why people have developed compression for video as you do not need to send every frame but only the pixels that have changed. 

---
For a true idea of the amount of data that it would take: According to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/1r6fz4/ps4ps_vita_remote_plays_uses_2030mbs_per_minute/) post on /r/vita the PS4-PS Vita uses ~20-30 MB per minute. (So anywhere from 0.33-0.5 MB/s) Odds are the PS4-PS4 uses the same idea and code as the PS4-Vita remote play so this should be about right.

EDIT: Removed trailing parenthesis and elaborated on the last sentence of the "Without compression" part. 




 The Clannad OST, along with Key's other works, is on the US iTunes right now. Key/VisualArts seems to be releasing all of their soundtracks and albums internationally. 




 There is also episode 3. 




 Bubblews is a mixed bag. Some love it while others claim it is just a big scam and if there is anything suspicious with your account, even if it isn't your fault, they will not pay you.

As for the foreign thing, I have no idea. 




 Nope. It was the first of their "Kinetic Novel" line, but it was not their first work. (Planetarian came out in 2006, while Clannad was out in 2004 and Kanon/Air even sooner.) 




 Huh, while I bought it used it seemed as though it was barely opened. Where you got yours from might have been a reprint or thrown away. 




 A little context for this, I found this slip within the booklet in the copy of the Clannad Soundtrack that I managed to find while I was in Japan. It seems to be announcing Key's "new" works such as Planetarian along with advertising their "current" games such as Air, Kanon, and Clannad.  









 Yeah, but that is only two seasons worth of episodes. (1 on, 1 off, 1 on) 




 It is where a series of two, or more, cour length is split over multiple seasons alternating whether it is airing or not.

Most of the time it just airs for a total of two seasons, but for the first time there is a series that is going to do split cour for a total of three seasons' worth of episode. (It will take five seasons to complete) It is the new Durarara anime that is doing this.  




 Shh, that never happened. It was never adapted until 2006. 




 Two seasons. (Each season is ~11-13 episodes long so this one will go for 22-26 episodes) 




 My guess is that we will know in due time.  




 I think OP is looking for an anime where the MC chooses everyone. (Not the sort of unknown end either) 









 For those of you wondering why I posted this, I decided to compare the fan translation/scan to the actual published volume to look for differences.

I found a few others but those are mainly details and the fan translation/scan cut a little bit off the top and bottom of the image. 




 That dang cat getting in on busting on Suzuki's well, uh, bust. 




 Do you have access to a black/whiteboard? One of the games that the anime club at my university plays is something along the lines of pictionary where you have one person draw something from a show and people have to guess where it is from or what character it is.

You'd have to have someone, who is running it, that pulls aside the person before they start drawing and ask them who/what they are going to draw so that when people guess you can judge whether it is right or wrong.

It is pretty fun and it can go for any length of time, but thirty minutes would be more than enough. 




 Rather than waiting for the third season that will never come, how about reading the light novels? They are available in English up to volume 11 or 12 out of 17 total volumes. 

The first season covers 1 and 2 and the second season covers 3 and 5. (They skipped volume 4) 




 They were ~$750 USD at the time those posts went up in Japan. 




 Would it account for all 300,000 sales? No, but evidence from past shows such as *K-ON!* where [people were going out and buying the $700 USD equivalent headphones that the characters used to the point that they sold out in the stores that sell them](http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=84543) lends some credence to that possibility.

The link goes to a forum post, but they gave and linked their sources enough that it is reputable. 




 Odds are, this is what increased sales of the game in Japan due to fans of the show going out and buying the game that the character is playing. 




 Heck, they even had the day theme from the game playing during the episode! 




 Most fansub groups have an IRC channel with a number of XDCC bots for people to use. So yeah, they are still around. 




 This is just /a/ pulling crap. I've read the manga up to the point that has been translated and none of this happens. 

Heck, other than the second point, those cannot happen as it is a "shounen" manga which is geared towards boys 12-19-ish...

 The one thing I really like about the recent posts by /u/Shadoxfix's bot, which uses his account, is that he includes the link to where you can legally watch it. 

I think there was something wrong with the bot so I copied the source from the episode 2 post, added the link to the second episode discussion and submitted it. 




 It is on Funimation. (You need their subscription to see the third episode but you can watch the first and second ones for free) 

There are *other* methods out there, but you are on your own.

 Better yet, when/if the kickstarter meets or exceeds its goal in November, the game will be released in English! (Sekai Project is even trying to get it on Steam but that one would be the all ages version. No idea how it is going to be all-ages without some of the scenes, but Frontwing [the developer] has a Vita version out which is all-ages.)

[Here is some more information about the Kickstarter right from Sekai Project.](http://prefundia.com/projects/view/lets-bring-the-grisaia-trilogy-to-the-west/2814/)
 




 It was complicated when it happened, but I would ask for you to search "truecrypt unsafe" for yourself to get an idea of what happened. 




 **WARNING:** TrueCrypt is not safe! There has been a lot of discussion over the months that hints that the developers of TrueCrpyt were coerced by government(s) into lessening the security of the software.  




 My university's anime club is crap. A lot of issues and drama that shouldn't be there is there so I don't bother going. 

I have found a number of people who watch anime and such that are pretty cool to hang out with so I do that.

My parents know about anime and such, but I have no idea what they think of it. They also know I have a few figures, but those were ones that I got while in Japan. My Mom likes the figures and thinks they are cool, but I have no idea what my father thinks. (I have a [Saber](http://myfigurecollection.net/item/111864), [Nadeko](http://myfigurecollection.net/item/175534) and a [Saber Lily nendoroid.](http://myfigurecollection.net/item/6581))

It says so on the bottom right of the image. 




 Something something doujinshi. 




 Something something /r/tsunderesharks 




 [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/seriesfaq-fate) is /r/anime's FAQ/"How to get into the Fate series" wiki page. I think it is fairly clear but it depends on how far down the rabbit hole you want to go.

The Fate series is part of a larger universe which is colloquially known as the "Nasuverse". From a rough estimate, there is about ~15-20 full days worth of content. (360-480 hours!!!) 




 [Here](http://js-fireworks.appspot.com/svg/index.html) is where they got the code that they had scrolling in the background. It is a webGL experiment to launch fireworks and show a message on the screen.

EDIT: Right click and select "View Source" to see it. 




 It happens quite often in anime where a female voice actress will voice a male, but seemingly female, character. (Hayate from *Hayate no Gotoku* comes to mind.) 




 This is the first time that I have ever heard Hebrew used in an anime.

Elohim means "God" and is used in the Bible to refer to God.

I can't find much about "Essaim" though... 




 Sensei and Ninomiya-kun from Minami-ke.  




 Yeah, I was doing mTurk before I even had a job. The surveys are, mainly, just giving your opinion and the tasks, if they are made right, give you more than enough instructions to do it. 

I'd suggest going to mTurk Forum (A third party forum) and using their daily recommended hits thread to find some of the better ones.

 While the title implies spoilers, please mark them accordingly since there are multiple series you are discussing. (Some of which people may or may not have seen)

 




 Then why does the ibuprofen bottle that I have list it as a fever reducer? http://i.imgur.com/XJmB0T9.jpg 




 Try using mTurk. (US Only) Unlike many of the other beermoney sites, this one always has work for people to do. It is run by Amazon, but they do not (at least that I have seen) post work themselves. People, mainly researchers, post tasks/surveys/jobs/things for people to do in return for money. I've made ~$900 over three years off and on doing odd jobs. 




 Here we go again... 

Even when she visited the university that I went to last year there were really high contentions. She had to have bodyguards and such. One thing, that I do not like about her is that she had someone pre-screen all of the questions from students even thought it was written in the contract that the Q A would be open. (Heck, she didn't even want a Q A session.) 

She talks about being a journalist but yet she does not follow the conventions of not censoring (ie. Pre-screening) speech...


As for the "feminist" side she wasn't the stereotypical nutty feminist that people make her out to be. Yeah, she tends to pick the major and blatant examples that fits her arguments but she presents them in a logical manner. 




 If anyone is wondering what it is, I guess it is the max character size in smiley faces. (2048)
 




 Not only is it a Steinway it is, most likely, a model D (9-ft grand piano used, mainly, in concert halls and it costs about $150,000 USD). They even got the internals from the main brass "Chassis" to the shape/color of the hammers to even the piano stool that they use. I think they even used a Steinway when producing the music as it sounds the same as the Steinways that I have heard.

Source: I see and hear a model D every single day and it always has its lid up, during the day. (All Steinway School) Sadly the thing is normally playing itself... :(

**EDIT**: Here are some pictures I quickly took of it:

 I hope they fall into usual patterns...

 .

 Otherwise they'd be stepping on each other's feet while dancing. 




 Don't be surprised to see Nozaki's counts go down. According to an earlier post the first volume of the anime included an event ticket which really jumps up the sales. 

Even so, I hope this means that they will make a second (or even a third) season. 




 Yeah, all of the Viz Media ones had to be removed by the developer. (There is a way around the block but involves installing a VPN and having your location set somewhere other than the US. Ironically, Japan works.) 




 Manga Rock is the one I use. It has access to a lot of different sites including batoto. (You can even search multiple sources at once!) 




 It is stated in the book that one alsin is about one meter. 

The other measurement that is unique to this series is the "koku" which is two hours. (ie. Half-koku is an hour) 




 "Friend maker" 




 While I am not a violinist, I think they even got the violin down with the correct finger placements and movement. (According to the PVs that are out.) 

I guess we'll have to wait until episode 2 to see the violin though. 




 While they aren't all Nintendo characters, there are figure shops in Japan. (Mainly around Akihabara and Nakano Broadway, but I image that there would be more around the country.) 




 While I am a mod here, I am talking as myself.

My thoughts are that you ought to make this as a "Request" thread but put the same rules and such in that post. 

My concern is that if we have this weekly, people will begin suggesting the same shows over and over until they get popular enough to break the qualifications. 

You may want to message the mods with the suggestion for a routine stickied post much like our current weekly suggestion threads. (I'd do it myself, but you are the one who has the idea and may be able to word it better than someone interpreting your post.) 




 No problem! I saw your question about it towards the mods and I double checked the rules and saw that was there. (I guess this way people can say "Hey, I like A:TLAB, what would be a good anime to watch?" and vice-versa.) 




 [Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5781/Isekai_no_Seikishi_Monogatari) - Pretty much fits your request to the letter. It is a spin-off of Tenchi Muyo but you don't have to know anything about that series to watch this one. 




 For some clarification, your recommendation of "The Legend of Korra" is allowed here since "Anime-inspired shows/films" is listed under accepted media.

 I am *shocked* that no one has mentioned the instruments in this episode!

They did an AMAZING job showing the instruments and the action of the keys, hammers and what not.

The Steinway   Sons piano is accurate down to the number of holes in the support, the model of the piano bench and everything else. (Source: I attend an all-Steinway university so I have seen them up close and even played them a bit. I am no where proficient with the piano but I have taken a little bit of lessons before.)

The keys that were played, throughout the episode, were accurate which really showed during the melodica scene during the trill around 17:07 is where I really noticed it. 




 Good enough that Guillermo del Toro is trying to get HBO to adapt it into a full series. (HBO is the same channel that is airing Game of Thrones) 

Source: http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/08/14/guillermo-del-toro-mentions-monster-adaptation-in-sugoi-japan-endorsement 




 Yeah, people got so many cards that they were able to guess the numbers even though they hadn't won them which is why your wins were empty. 




 Nope, the first episode was delayed until this week's monday. It will then return to its normal airing time. (Every Thursday) 




 Whoops, I meant to say for them to search for episode 1... 




 So far, there aren't any official sources for watching this show. To answer your question would be to break the rules. Try google searching for episode one since it is "out" and subbed somewhere.

Hint: Watch for /u/Shadowfix 's bot to post the discussion thread for it. It also looks the sites that people put fansubs on. 




 I wish they hadn't revealed that the red-haired girl was someone working with "Shepherd" in episode 1. I haven't read the source, as it isn't translated, but it seemed to be giving the viewer too much right off the bat. 

I guess, now the question isn't of who but why and how they are doing what they are doing.

I'll stick with this one as it seems as though it is a light-hearted series. Also, the VN is made by August who made "Brighter than the Dawning Blue" and "Fortune Arterial". (They've made others, but those two have been adapted into anime.) 




 There is "Osu!" which is a free music/rhythm game that can be played with only the mouse. There are thousands of charts/maps that are out there for you to play and there is even multiplayer. 




 That is why I said most of their shows are. Nichijou was only licensed in Australia. 




 Just because it isn't being simulcasted doesn't mean that it won't make it to the US. Odds are someone will license it considering most of KyoAni's works have been. (Except for Nichijou) 




 The CG is better in S2. 




 I think they did it like that because the MC is in the same situation. You learn of the world and what is going on as the MC does. 




 It got delayed due to a volleyball game going longer than anticipated. It was pushed to Monday. The second episode will air on Thursday at its normal time. 




 Heads up, no official source. Head to the high seas.

 Sadly people ruined the fun for everyone else by exploiting the website to generate wins. (Each win gave you $6 and they repeated it as much as they could.)

M Ms then only gave credit towards your cable bill... :( 




 Well, it is always the right moon if you *type* it out. 




 I wouldn't be surprised if that is where they got their inspiration from. 




 Welcome to the western world. They don't allow adult (AKA AO rated) content on Steam. This also goes for brick and mortar stores such as Wal Mart, Target, Best Buy, etc... 




 It may still have NSFW, but not the H, scenes in it. Sekai contacted Steam and they have worked out a way to possibly have those scenes. 




 I would suggest waiting until the game comes out on Steam. Yes, the VN (the all ages version) will be coming out on Steam in English. (Sekai Project has the rights to release it) 




 Even so, it is unmarked. 




 **WARNING:** The "Here is the original for the Amane bedroom scene is **NSFW!!!***

 There isn't anything inside the windows. It is just a gradient from the bottom right to the upper part of the middle. 




 Thing is, the writing quality of the translation is pretty good. It is a lot better than you think it is. (At least up through volume 5, which is where I am at.) There is a lot of intrigue and characterization that occurs and it is pretty good all things considered. 




 I would suggest reading the light novels. You can find them on the usual site. (It says "preview" but it is the full book.) 

The LNs are a lot better than what the anime is making it out to be. While the fan service scenes are there they are fairly short and only really happen once or twice a volume. (224 pages or so.) They are also brought up again later so they serve an actual purpose. 




 It definitely has a big budget. The big (ie. Little) things I noticed:

* Finger positions and movement while playing the violin
* The action of the piano
* The "Steinway   Sons" licensing, which I imagine would not be cheap
* Animation quality
* Sound/OST quality was really really good even though it was hosted on YouTube...
 




 Heck, Madoka was only 1 cour and you see how well that was written/done. 




 [Gate: Thus the JSDF Fought There](http://myanimelist.net/manga/41733/Gate:_Jieitai_Kanochi_nite_Kaku_Tatakeri) which applies a similar idea as Outbreak Company but with the JSDF (Japanese Self Defense Force), which is basically Japan's military. 

**WARNING**: Some of the scenes are gruesome and may contain full frontal nudity. It is still a great read and it is released monthly. 




 Even better is that you can easily buy the soundtrack through iTunes. 




 Shouldn't it be:

Counteraction:  
[X] Rising    
[ ] Falling   




 Thank you for reminding people to use the correct flair. I've changed it for OP. 




 It isn't that we are getting lazy, it is moreso the fact that college has started back up and we are busy.

I've changed the flair for the thread to "Request".
