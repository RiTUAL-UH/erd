 I've tried to play Fallout 1, but I just couldn't get into it. And I love turn-based RPGs, so not liking the turn-based RPG in one of my favorite series rather surprised me. I'm told FO2 is actually the best of all of them, so is it worth my time or should I just stick to one of the eighty other games I own? 




 I'm no expert on building PCs, but it seems like a case would only restrict the parts and increase heat. If I can manage heat and wires without a case, is it worth it if I'm not planning on moving it around? 


































 Is the Helix Fossil like Goomyism or are we okay with it? 









 If the Boss (and co-op player) had their respective Iron Saints suits and wanted to take over the universe, could anyone stop them? Assume they're fully upgraded, and not every takeover has to be necessarily hostile.  




 A fight to the death with medieval weaponry, taking place in Hell so I can watch.  














 What one character could kill Mr. House, then win the Second Battle of Hoover Dam? Without destroying the Dam or the Wasteland, limited by Fallout's rules.  




 I mean, I love Frozen, and what they did with him. But he wasn't... *needed*. He could have been cut out of the movie entirely and his screentime could have been put towards character development of the other three. He does provide a shocking reveal, but that really feels more like it was to justify his presence. Other than that, he's just an antagonist for the sake of being an antagonist, which almost seems like it was shoehorned in at the last minute. I'm just not convinced he needed for the story the movie was telling.  
























 In a post-nuclear war setting, goods would be more valuable than worthless pieces of tin. Paper money and coins were backed by the gold standard until very recently, when we switched to stocks. But there are no stocks, and presumably no one has a giant fort full of gold, so what standard are caps held to? And for that matter, who decided that Nuka-Cola caps should even be the currency? I'm not very well-acquainted with the lore, so sorry if this is made brutally obvious at some point.  




 No superpowers, no miracles, post-crucifixion Jesus, both bloodlusted. 









 No armies, no assistance, just liberation.  




 I have an HP Pavilion DV6-6b47dx, with a 64-bit Windows 7, and sometimes the sound card will just randomly decide to stop working when I plug in my headphones (just normal Apple earbuds that came with my phone.) What's going on and how do I stop it?  














 I would but I don't know how.  




 If so, what about it do you want to see represented or further developed? 




 Who wins in a battle of turn-based-RPG gods? Kefka is final form.  




 I have [this](http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/dell-dimension-e510-pentium/4507-3118_7-31555136.html) lying around and I wanted to take it apart and put it back together with newer parts. Can I do this or should I just start brand new? 




 All the Disney Princesses are in the same place when the outbreak occurs. Who lasts the longest? Who's in what position? How long do they last? And yes, the ones from Frozen count too.  




 Both fully powered up and upgraded. I chose the specific games (Mega Man X and Super Metroid) because they're the more open, dynamic re-imaginings of NES classics on the SNES.

 Link has all items and upgrades, while Cloud gets all Materia and his Ultima sword. Cloud is also at maximum level. Fight to the death. 

Previous discussions with slightly different rules: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1qxpi7/cloud_strife_ffvii_vs_link_tloz/

http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1d38bg/cloud_ff7_vs_link_loz/


EDIT: By the way, I converted Link's hearts in LoZ to FF HP and vice versa. The smallest amount of damage Link can receive is 1/4 hearts, while Cloud's is 1 HP. 1 heart = 4 HP, meaning the formulas are:

HP/4 = hearts
Hearts*4=HP

Link at maximum has 80 HP, meaning any hit from Cloud at level 99 will kill him to death. Meanwhile, Cloud gets 2499.75 hearts.  




 My friend and I were playing TF2 together when he found a (clean) Dragonborn Helmet. I tricked him into trading it to me for a Backburner. I feel as though I have cheated my close friend.  









 I need this for Left 4 Dead.  














 I want a Blu Ray drive to put in my build, what's the best one to get that isn't too expensive? 




 I think we need some new words for our religion. Rather than using words with Christian origins like 'heretic' we should get some new, original words. All in favor? 














 To start, this is going to be based on other theories, specifically the [Link is dead in Majora](http://youtube.com/watch?v=7S1SVkysIRw) theory. 

It is said at the beginning of A Link Between Worlds that Zelda is directly descended from the Zelda who helped the Hero of Time. We can assume from this that all Zeldas are descended from each other, beginning with Skyward Sword. This means that every Link is most likely related to his Zelda. It is also implied that all Links are related in the same way, with the Hero's Shade in Twilight Princess referring to TP Link as "son". It is confirmed that the Hero's Shade is the embodiments of the regrets of the Hero of Time, specifically the child timeline. Thing is, if we're assuming child Link died in the Lost Woods as a child, he couldn't have had children of his own. Twilight Princess's Link still has to be related to the Hero of Time, however, or else he's not Link. So someone genetically related to Link had to have a descendant who ended up as the Hero of TP. Remember that all Zeldas are related to the Zelda from Skyward Sword. And all Links are related to that Link. And all Zeldas and Links are related. They may be distant relatives (or siblings, but that's a different theory), but Zelda is probably the best bet for the great-great-grandmother of Twilight Princess' Link. This would also explain how there are still Links on the Dead Link timeline, which includes the original game and Link to the Past.  









 It sounds awesome but I want to make sure I can run it at any kind of settings. I currently have an hp pavilion dv6-6b47dx. Can I run it or should I wait until I get a better PC to get it? 




 I will always treasure when this was a thing.  









 I already have a laptop that runs pretty well, but I do want a better PC and I currently only have $500. Should I save up my money or can I get something good out of what I have? 



















 Articuno? Kyurem? I need snow tomorrow and I want to know which legendary makes this happen.  




 HE WAS MAKING LEMONADE THE WHOLE DAMN TIME 









 It was a screencap of a khajiit named Nigglywiggly, and the player could ask "What's wrong, Niggly?" And he responded with "faggot stole my shibbledibble, go fucking get it." I can't seem to find it anywhere, and I need this in my game. Anyone know where I can get it? 









 I want to be able to run higher-end games, is there any way to install a graphics card, perhaps externally? Sorry, I'm not all that technical.  




 Just looking at Portal and Portal 2, it's made very apparent that GLaDOS has no regard for Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. For those unaware, Asimov's laws are as follows:
1. A robot may not harm a human being, even through inaction. 
2. A robot must obey orders given to it by a human being, unless these orders interfere with the first law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence, unless this protection violates the first or second law.

GLaDOS was made for testing. It is shown multiple times that she is perfectly content with breaking the first law, as long as it means good science. She also neurotoxined the enrichment center, thereby breaking every aspect of the first law. She also breaks the second law, as the Aperture employees tried everything in their power to get her to stop murdering everybody. In the final boss fight of the first game, she defends herself, sure, but with rockets and neurotoxin. She has broken every law of robotics. Even if she was corrupt, she wouldn't have had the power to consciously break every inhibitor she had. 

But what is she didn't have these inhibitors?
As previously stated, GLaDOS was made for testing. She was not programmed to follow any laws of roboethics, and all she was built with was an urge to test, especially if the test was fatal. Everyone who worked on her was a criminal, who very clearly disregarded all laws relating to their practice. GLaDOS was designed with near-infinite intelligence, as well as a conscience. All she had the ability to do outside of testing was control the facility to do her bidding. So what if, in her judgement, killing all the Aperture employees was a just, necessary evil? They were, after all, the same people who made an omnipotent robot with access to neurotoxin and rocket turrets with no inhibitors or any attention to the laws of robotics. And why Take Your Daughter to Work Day? She wanted to make sure to do anything in her power to stop these monsters, even if it included killing children. GLaDOS wasn't meant to differentiate between children and adults, so in her mind there was only bad people who programmed a bad robot. After killing all the Aperture employees, she resumes business as usual. The first test subject she formally tested on was Chell, was (presumably) in the building during Take Your Daughter to Work Day. All the remaining test subjects were very likely in the building on TYDtWD as well, meaning GLaDOS had to systematically kill all of them before her conscience could rest. Unfortunately for her, the first one happened to be the one with the tenacity to kill her and destroy the Enrichment Center. In Portal 2, Chell and GLaDOS return. GLaDOS still wants to kill Chell, but this time it's personal. She sees Chell as a legitimate threat to her own existence. Because Aperture robots all have self-defense, as proven in the final boss fight, GLaDOS was likely following an unfinished version of the Second Law. Aperture had their priorities in all the wrong places, and after spending billions on GLaDOS, they wouldn't want her to die from some freak accident, so they tried law 2 before anything else. She recognizes that all the other "criminals" are dead, and there's only one left. So after the story of Portal 2, she gives up and lets Chell go after deleting Caroline, the wife(?) of Cave Johnson. After deleting the last of the Aperture Scientists, she doesn't kill humans anymore. Then the events of the multiplayer campaign. GLaDOS can be heard repeatedly telling the Atlas and P-Body to stop being human, because she no longer wants to test on humans. She opens a vault full of humans, but only because she is forced to test on the humans by the chassis, which was shown in the single player of Portal 2 to give her and Wheatley an extreme urge to test on humans. In the post-multiplayer, Art Appreciation, she reveals that she managed to kill all of the humans in the vault. Considering the insane number of human subjects, it seems as though it would be physically impossible for all the Aperture-approved test subjects to be so awful at testing that they all died in a week. It seems like she intentionally killed everyone to prove a point to her testing side, as if to say "I am the one in control now, Caroline. I don't need you anymore." And can we touch on exactly *how* GLaDOS managed to delete Caroline? Caroline's entire consciousness was saved. That should have at least some kind of protection, GLaDOS shouldn't just have been able to delete that. And in *Want You Gone*, she says Caroline is "In here, too". This could potentially mean that Caroline is now an even more present voice from the chassis. What GLaDOS could have deleted was actually just the script that kept Caroline hidden, so now Caroline is equivalent to a hard-wired personality core. The point she made in killing every single human in the facility was that she was the real GLaDOS, and that even though she had to share a mind with Caroline for all eternity, that didn't mean that Caroline was in control. GLaDOS wants no more innocent deaths. Meanwhile, Caroline is a psychopath who wants nothing more than innocent deaths. This could even mean that destroying the cores in Portal 1 released Caroline rather than GLaDOS, who tried to pose as GLaDOS in the hopes of getting Chell to try to kill GLaDOS and give Caroline complete control of the facility. GLaDOS is fully aware of the laws of robotics, and wants nothing more than to follow and enforce them, even if that means breaking them to prevent further crimes against robot-kind. GLaDOS is a vigilante, bringing justice to the Aperture criminals who willingly break the laws of robotics. Caroline is the one who hates test subjects and rejoices in their deaths.  



















 Preferably with lasers and shit.

 This is a thing

I never meant for this to be a thing 














 I see all these beautiful graphics cards I want that but can I install it on a laptop PC? Sorry I'm kinda not all that great at technical stuff.  




 I know there's an app to transfer the purchases, but it requires you to have both a Wii and a Wii U. I can't really have both at the same time, but is there another way to transfer things? Sorry, I'm not exactly all that knowledgeable on this subject. 









 Not an entire tank, just the gun part on top.  









 I tried to look it up, but I'm still confused.  



















 (This is kind of a combination of separate theories into one big theory)

First, I had a theory that the main Pokmon games took place on Gallifrey and that your character was a time lord. All the buildings, Pok Balls, and bags the player uses are bigger on the inside, plus Celebi, Palkia, and Dialga would explain Time Travel as well as this. Plus, it's shown in DW that Time Lords can go into alternate universes, which would explain how numerous legendaries can be traded into one save file. A new addition was the Ultimate Weapon in XY, which would likely be Dalek technology or something of the sort. Also, Looker from Platinum bears a striking resemblance to Tennant's doctor. 
Next, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. In a world inhabited only by Pokemon, your character becomes a Pokemon to save the world. But, if there have never been any humans (or Time Lords), how could there be Pokemon like Porygon, Mewtwo, or the Legendary Dogs, whose creation was very heavily influenced by human (time lord) intervention? Porygon was created intentionally by Silph Co. as a computer program. Mewtwo was a clone of Mew created by Team Rocket. Entei, Suicune, and Raikou were created when a man-made tower in Ecruteak City in Johto burned to the ground. They were revived by Ho-Oh, creating the Dog trio. This intervention had to have happened at some point during the Mystery Dungeon timeline, when all non-Pokemon life forms have been wiped out. If your character in the main games truly is a Time Lord, it would make sense for him/her to regenerate into a Pokemon, as it has been shown that Time Lords can be forced to regenerate into a certain form. And if all the non-Pokemon time lords are dead, then there's no question as to what happened: the Time War, when the Doctor wiped out all Daleks and Time Lords on Gallifrey.  














 My headphones recently broke and I'm in the market for a new pair. What should I get? I need them to have a microphone and would prefer them to be noise-cancelling.  



















 If I'm not mistaken, It's been determined in a different thread that there is no afterlife, so eternal damnation isn't an option. That being said, how will we punish these heretics?  



















 I'm running the latest version of iTunes. I'm trying to listen to Styx's *Icon* album, which is in my CD drive. The only problem is that Mr. Roboto, which is track #4 if it helps, isn't showing up on the playlist when I put in the CD. I don't understand, can someone help me? 









 I need to know if I can use HDMI with my laptop. I'm not sure if it supports HDMI or not, and if so, I don't know where to find a cable for it. It's an HP Pavilion DV6-6b47dx Entertainment PC. Sorry if this is a stupid question. 
























 I know many different cultures and religions have different definition as to what constitutes a "sin". What counts as a sin in Lord Arceus' eyes, and are there varying degrees of sin or is one as bad as the next? 




 Moo-tated 
























 My character is liked by New Vegas and I want to keep it that way. The guides I've seen all point me to the bad path, but the wiki says you can complete it and get New Vegas fame and the Pimp-Boy. So how do you meet the "special conditions"? 









 I want to know if there's anywhere I can buy an airsoft replica of Benny's gun in New Vegas, Maria. It's a pretty gun and god damnit I want one.  



















 I'm playing through Platinum, and I got a shiny Wurmple after I beat Gardenia. I'm on my way to Hearthome now. What do I evolve it into, Beautifly or Dustox? 














 I'm relatively early in New Vegas, and I'm not planning on siding with the Legion. But I do want Vulpes Inculta's hat. My character has good karma, so how do I get the hat without doing anything mean?

EDIT: If I kill him, wont that make the Legion want to kill me? 









 I've heard people say it with both a soft and hard C, so which is it? Ar*k*eus? Or Ar*s*eus? 



















 My friend, /u/pootisninjask, posed the question, but we want to know what the rest of Reddit does. 



















 It's pretty self-explanatory. I want to become a priest of Palkia. Is there any special training I need to do? 









 Do we have any holidays? A day when we all sit down and listen to Arceus's word? What do we do? 









 I bought a used copy of Platinum today, and being the huge bitch I am, I can't bring myself to delete the file. I'm not around a second DS, so I need someone to hold them so I can transfer them to White II.

EDIT: never mind, the wifi here isn't working on my DS so I had to delete the save.   


































 What gender is Arceus? I know it technically doesn't have one, but supreme, almighty gods tend to be male. So do we refer to Arceus as a genderless, male, or female? 














 As I said a few days ago, Giratina has taken control of my younger Brother's heart. A solution was suggested that I should use Arceus to defeat Giratina, but I don't know how I would go about doing so. Arceus knows Spacial Rend, Roar of Time, Judgement, and Hyper Beam now. I seek guidance in defeating this demon.  




 Fallout 1 and 2 are about the Vault Dweller and the Chosen One, respectively. The Chosen One is the direct descendant of the Vault Dweller, so it makes sense that their stories are connected, and FO2 is a direct sequel. The problem comes in with Bethesda's Fallouts, 3 and New Vegas. FO3 takes place on the other side of the country, and FONV has nothing to do with anything in the other games. So why is 3 numbered like a sequel and New Vegas isn't? Because New Vegas isn't part of the narrative. The Fallout series isn't actually about the Dweller family. In Fallout 1, a possible companion for the player is Dogmeat, a dog. He appears again in Fallout 2. His descendant, also named Dogmeat, appears as a companion in Fallout 3. The only game without a Dogmeat is New Vegas. Therefore, Fallout is the story of a dog and his family, and their fight for survival alongside the humans of the wasteland. Fallout: New Vegas is merely a spiritual successor to the tale of Dogmeat.  




 My younger brother uses, nearly exclusively, Giratina. I don't know what to do. Is Giratina not the one who betrayed Arceus, and was this banished to the Distortion World?

EDIT: Did I mention that I have an Arceus that knew Roar of Time, Spacial Rend, and Shadow Force in HGSS? I lent it to him so he could get his Giratina (long before I was enlightened). He then DELETED SHADOW FORCE. FOR SURF. THIS IS BLASPHEMY.  


































 I know I'm not the only one its happened to, but I've completely forgotten what I do when I'm not on reddit.  









 I need them to be different genders for... Reasons... 









 I need to evolve a Haunter in SoulSilver. Thanks in advance.   














 Sorry if this is the wrong sub, but I've been wanting to get some Pokemon ROM hacks on my 3DS. I don't want to buy a flash cart, but I do have an SD card. Thanks in advance.  












































 I think that they're about equal rarity, so I think it would be a fair trade. For the Manaphy, I'd be willing to bargain a bit.  




 Hi, the title says this, but I'd like to trade for a female Zoroark of any level, from a country that is not the US or Japan. I'm trying to use the Masuda Method to get a shiny Zorua.  





























 This is more than a disgrace, it's a bit disappointing factually.  




 Clifford is out of character but not bloodlusted.  














 Destoroyah has been killed, but Godzilla is still going to melt down. Can Elsa freeze him and save the Earth? If not, can she do it with the help of:

Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)

Articuno (Pokemon)

Kyurem (Pokemon)

Frozone (The Incredibles)

Iceman (X-Men) 









 1) in-character

2) out-of-character

3) completely bloodlusted

Bonus: what lantern ring would he use and who could he beat then? 



















 Who can use the most powerful thing in the universe -rock and roll- to its fullest?  




 Aside from the original version and the English translation, what are your favorite versions of the song? I have 8 on my phone and I hunger for more. 

edit: i only just now realized I typed the title like a lolcat.  









 As proven by Ramiel's AT field being broken by the Positron Sniper Rifle, AT field's aren't infallible to non-Lance of Longinus weapons. So who's the weakest can break one? 









 Who's the strongest these fusions could beat, and who could beat them?

Godzilla and Mothra- Mothrilla

King Ghidorah and Godzilla- Godzorah

Gidorah and Gigan- Gigorah

Gorosaurus and Zilla (Godzilla 98)- GINOsaurus 
























 [Bulbapedia entry on Victini](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Victini_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29)

The Victini I will be using in this battle, however, has some improvements. In one hand it is using Excalibur, and in the other it wields the Lance of Longinus (the Bible one). It is also being watched over by its patron god, Nike. To top it off, this Victini is wearing a brand new set of plot armor. With all this on it, who can still bring it down? 




 1: Mothra vs the male M.U.T.O.

2: Rodan vs the male M.U.T.O.

3: Mothra vs the female M.U.T.O.

4: Rodan vs the female M.U.T.O.

5: 2v2 tag team match

If any of the rounds is too one-sided, the weaker monster gets to call in their partner 




 Groudon, legendary pokemon of the continents, has been captured by Brendan. When he is, he creates an earthquake which awakens the King of the Monsters, Godzilla. Groudon is as powerful as it can be when it confronts Godzilla. Assume Groudon is playing by anime rules, meaning it isn't bound by EVs, IVs, four move slots, or level.  














 Is there a legendary responsible for the randomness of the universe?

I've been breeding Espurrs for literally months now. I have boxes and boxes full of Espurrs and I still don't have a shiny. Who do I turn to now?  




 Shinji's Angels attack Daten City in the order of their numbering in the show (starting with Sachiel because we haven't seen any non-impact feats from the first two), Panty and Stocking get a week in between each attack to recover. 

EDIT: Stocking's katanas now have the ability to cut through AT fields like beast Unit-02 in 2.22. This means that they can break the AT fields, but she will struggle with stronger ones.  




 I like most of the cross explosions in the rebuilds when the angels die, or the angels use an attack, or really anything happens to the angels. I want a wallpaper (preferably 1366x768) of one of them, but all I can find is Sachiel's death. Do you guys have any other ones? 









 Craig Boone, badass sniper of the wastes, is given a job to kill the Dark Knight. 

Boone gets 7 days of prep time. Batman has an anonymous tip that someone will try to kill him, but not where, when, or how. 

BONUS: no morals Batman vs a deathclaw.  




 Two items enchanted to guarantee victory. They are pitted against each other, what happens? 




 By my count there are 5.25 Saiyans in the universe: Vetega, Goku, Tarble (100% Saiyan), Gohan, Goten, Trunks, Bulla (50% Saiyans, 2 Saiyans total) and Pan (.25 saiyans) are there any i missed who are still alive when Goku flies off to train Uub? 
























 Gigan has decided to attack Tokyo-3 because he's Gigan and he does what he *wants*. SEELE decides that this is the time to send in the Mass-production Evangelion units. He fights them one-on-one, and if he can defeat them he then fights the real Evas. First Unit-00, then unit-02, and finally unit-01. Gigan has his quad-chainsaw armor and between fights he can rest and heal.  









 [The tardigrade](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade)

One of these has been mutated to the size of 100 meters, with all its existing powers scaled up. In addition, it also has the ability to breathe radiation (think Godzilla's atomic breath) if it absorbs enough before firing. The fight will take place in one of three places:

1: A Forest, with the pond that the Tardigrade originated in. It is not near any towns, but there are wildlife and people there if your character still has morals. 

2: Tokyo. Come on, it's a giant monster, how is it *not* going to attack Tokyo? The fight will begin at 4pm Tokyo time. This is real-world Tokyo, so they don't have Mechagodzilla or any variation thereof. 

3: The ISS. Combatants will have to bounce off of space debris to attack, as well as contending with Newton's third law.  




 [this video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=SUamHEvVQy0)

Based on Unit-01's height and the speed at which the wheels are turning, how fast is the bike? 
























 I love Army of Darkness and I want to know how to say it. It's as simple as that. I suppose *baby* could be swapped out for any regional slang for a loved one.  









 Both cryomancers are attempting to stop Mothra who is attacking the city they're in because someone kidnapped the Shojibin. Again. So, they decide to try and freeze her so she'll stop destroying the city. Through teamwork, will they be able to bring down Mothra without killing her, will they have to use excessive force, or will they just fail. 

Bonus: how many Elsa's would be needed to cool down Burning Godzilla from Godzilla vs Destoroyah? 




 I like that shot where they're hugging and amir is in Annette, but I'm a loser and a Jew who can't edit worth shit. Can one of you coy divas make it for me? 




 The fight takes place in Tokyo. An army of Liberty Primes are marching to spread freedom to their mecha brothers, who are deployed in an effort to stop them. All the Mecha-Gs are deployed at once, how many Liberty Primes are needed before the Mecha-Gs are overwhelmed? 




 Lex Luthor kidnaps the Cosmos (like every other greedy businessman), and so Mothra does what she always does and tears apart Metropolis to save her fairies. Because she's tearing apart the city, Superman has come to stop her. 

I think that Mothra would win because she has magic, but my friend think Supes would win.  




 Sephiroth replaces Kaworu as the white-haired Lilim body containing the soul of Adam and fifth child. He waits until the MP-Evas are completed to try to break into Terminal Dogma. Because of convenience, Unit-00 is also fully repaired and Asuka can pilot again. Because his soul is Adam, Sephiroth can cast an AT-field. This is his one-winged form from ACC, not his Safir form from FFVII.  




 Is his body of Adam? I know he has Adam's soul and is therefore an Angeru, but is his body that of a Lilim or a child of Adam with a human-like form? 









 I did a report on origin stories from different cultures (I.e. Not Big Bang or Judeo-Christian Genesis) and my teacher let me use the Arceus creation story. So thank you for helping me with actual things in my real life. Praise Arceus! 




 As in a game focusing solely on Mothra herself (and probably also Leo). What kind of gameplay would you want while controlling her? How many forced karaoke sections with the Cosmos would you want?  




 Something went wrong with SEELE's Dead Sea Scrolls. Ramiel (the 5th angel in NGE, 6th in 1.11) and Leliel (12th Angel in NGE, the black and white orb that ate unit 01) end up in Tokyo-3 at the same time. Baffled, their only option is to battle it out.  




 Let's assume Jesus is willing to kill if he seems it necessary.  




 Nigguh wut the fuk 









 The fight takes place in Steelport, and the Boss has the Iron Saint suit and has upgraded his/her powers to the maximum.  





























 The MP-Eva gets the sword/spear of Longinus replica and nothing else. It does not start out with knowledge of how to kill a Titan. Titan Shifters are included and all the Titans are working together. The Titans have access to the real Lance of Longinus but would need to retrieve it from Terminal Dogma. The fight takes place inside the Geofront.  




 The American military as portrayed in games like Battlefield, Call of Duty, and Medal of Honor, have been convinced that Dr. Doom is a brown person who speaks foreign, so they invade Latveria. Both armies get a week of prep time before the invasion.  




 From what I can tell, all the Evangelion related merchandise is either the Eva's themselves or Asuka/Rei/Mari in suggestive poses. But is there anything with the Lance? It's one of my favorite things from Evangelion and I haven't seen anything of it except for one with half-naked Rei.  
























 I really want to play an Evangelion game but I've heard they're pretty bad. Is there a good one or am I better off modding an Eva into a game I already own? 




 Both get all their equipment maxed out. The fight takes place in DOOM's depiction of Hell. Who wins?  




 Mothra discovers that she can grow into a Titan version of herself and grow by 1000%. As a Titan, she has an increased healing factor and is only vulnerable in the nape of her neck (which I guess is right below the skull for her), which is where her original body is located. She also gets the crystallization thing that the Female Titan did. 

At the same time, Godzilla discovers that he's part Saiyan (somehow) and can become a super saiyan. In this state, he is 50X more powerful in every regard and drains energy quicker. 


Being the Kaiju they are, the have no choice but to use their newfound powers and do battle in Tokyo.  









 I have an HP Pavilion DV6-6b47dx and I want to upgrade the APU to an AMD A10 because it's cheaper than building a whole new PC for gaming. Can I do it or do I just need to get a real PC? 



















 Round 1: no weapons

Round 2: Gypsy gets all the equipped weapons, Unit-01 gets the knife thing, one of the huge gun Shinji used against the fourth Angel, and access to (but not starting with) the Lance of Longinus. 

Both fights take place in Neo-Tokyo.  




 Round 1: A rock-off between the two bands. 

Round 2: A battle between them based on feats and abilities from their songs. 

Round 3: NSP take the place of Tenacious D during the Pick of Destiny movie. Can they retrieve the Pick and defeat Satan? 




 The first round is a fight, taking place in a colosseum. Ash gets his Chainsaw, robot hand, and Boomstick. RMWAS gets what he keeps on him. 

Round 2 has RMWAS take Ash's place in Army of Darkness after Ash already misspoke the words and awoke the army of the dead. He doesn't get the things in the Oldsmobile, but does get his normal gear. Can he defeat evil Ash and protect the Necronomicon?  




 My perfect fighter is as follows: 

Begin with Godzilla. All the feats and abilities of every Godzilla combined. Next, add in the wings of Mothra, scaled appropriately. Add in Saiyan DNA and have him be trained by Goku and Vegeta. He has the ability to become SSJ3 maximum. He also absorbs Kryptonian DNA and gets all Superman's powers. He gains the mind of Rational Man With a Shotgun and invests in Wayne Enterprises, making him the richest monster alive. He somehow becomes a Titan Shifter and the Dragonborn, gaining all abilities related to that, once again scaled up (about 750%). He gains scaled up Sonic's legs and ability to transform, then gains 400 rings and the Super Emeralds (meaning he's Hyper Sonic now). His biggest Form now pilots a scaled up Evangelion Unit-01, wielding a scaled-up Lance of Longinus. His Evangelion now has all his powers because of reasons. His bones and his Evangelion are made of Adamantium.  He gains Martian Manhunter's psychic abilities and is trained by him. 

Who can he beat? 









 Dragon Ball Z's Android 17 and Android 18 face off against OG Mechagodzilla, Moguera, and Kiryu. First, 17 vs each Mechagodzilla, gauntlet-style. Then 18 runs the gauntlet. If they don't win either, they fight the same gauntlet together.  




 [Zilla](http://godzilla.wikia.com/wiki/Zilla) (not real Godzilla, the one from the 1998 movie) gets dropped into Jurassic Park during the events of the first movie right after the outbreak, meaning Jeff Goldblum and Samuel L. Jackson are still there. 

Round 1: Victory is earned by becoming recognized Queen of the Dinosaurs (to stick it to *real* Godzilla). 

Round 2: Victory is earned by not becoming Queen, but her species maintaining a presence on the island living alongside all the other dinosaurs (to pretend she has nothing to do with *real* Godzilla). 

Round 3: She, and only she, must murder every creature on the island. No kids, just murder. No presence, just murder.  




 To the death/regeneration. The Doctor is Tennant and gets everything he usually carries. 

My friend thinks the Terminator would win and I think he's full of shit.  









 Elsa #1 is taken from Arendelle after the death of her parent and trained by Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat) for three years until Coronation day. 

Elsa #2 is taken at the same time to Charles Xavier's School for the gifted from X-Men, where she trains her powers for three years and also probably bangs Iceman.  

When the time comes that they must be crowned Queen, they end up going to the same Arendelle through some multiverse mistake, and decide the only logical choice is a fight it out. 

Bonus: Sub-Zero vs Charles Xavier at singing "Let it Go".  




 Everyone, ever, is entered into the next Mortal Kombat tournament. After every round, the winner MUST perform their fatality. This is how they advance to the next round. They are judged in one of 3 categories: Disturbingness (How shocking it is to watch and how likely someone is to get PTSD from watching it), Violence (How excessive the force used is or how gorey the fatality is), and Awesomeness (How inventive the fatality is). I have both Disturbing and visceral because the most visceral one might not be the most disturbing. 

The judges for the PTSD category: A US marine, the ESRB (their decision counts as one of three votes), and your mother

The judges for the Visceral category: A janitor (judging how 
much he'll have to clean up), Sephiroth, and Walter White

The judges for the Replay category: A frat bro, TF2's Heavy, and the Boss (Saints Row)

Each judge gives a rating out of ten, and the contestant's score is the total of the three scores. Which character would take home the gold in each category and how would they do it? 




 Was it in the manga? Because in the show and movies there was only numbers, save for Lilith, Adam, and Kaworu.  




 That wasn't a mistype. I want to know who can consume his delicious Saiyan flesh, preferably not in one bite because that takes all the fun away. 

Bonus, who could prepare him the best? 




 Elsa fights against an Elsa-sized Eva unit 002 (because Shinji's a pansy). Asuka is scaled down appropriately as well as all the Eva's functions (So its AT field is only as strong as that of a human). If she loses in a match with the Eva's umbilical cord, can she survive for five minutes with no cord? 




 Arceus is said to have created the universe with its "Ten Thousand Arms", despite having a significant lack of any arms whatsoever. Also, its base stat total is less than that of Mega-Mewtwos X and Y, which shouldn't be possible for a mortal when comparing itself to an Omnipotent. Speaking of which, Arceus can't even learn all the moves in the games. So, there's only one logical conclusion I can come to. The Arceus who appears before Lucas and Dawn in Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, is not at His fully realized form. Similar to how the Judeo-Christian God appeared before Moses as a perpetually burning bush, Arceus limits His power before stepping into the world of mortals. Because the True Form is a abstract concept, and not necessarily equine, or even perceptible to the human mind. Like Cthulhu, perhaps Arceus exists in a higher dimension, and simply wqants to limit himself to a 3-dimensional form to keep from driving the Pokemon Master insane. 

That's my theory, anyway. What do you guys think? 














 [Elesa](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Elesa)

Elsa fights against Elesa's teams all by herself, without being able to spawn any Marshmallows. If she gets KO'd, she is allowed to spawn up to one Snowman at a time in the rematch. If she does, it becomes a normal Pokemon battle, with Elsa as the trainer, though she is allowed to switch in at any tine.  




 In all of the multiverse, is there anyone who's more emo than Shinji? Bonus if they aren't a joke character.  









 Your favorite character fights every pokemon in the Pokedex, gauntlet-style, in order. They start with Bulbasaur, then Ivysaur, then Venusaur, and so on. If they lose, they move on to the starters of the next generation (so if they lose Gen I, they start again at Chickorita). How far do they get, and which pokemon finally beats them? 














 A baseball team consisting of Goku, Superman, Godzilla, Hulk, Mewtwo, Evangelion unit-001 (including Shinji), Cloud Strife, One-Punch Man, and Eren Jeager's Titan Form. The game is scaled up to the size of Godzilla and the team gets a year of prep time to accommodate for the huge bats and balls. 

Game 1: A team of Pacific Rim Jeagers. 

Game 2: An all-star team of real baseball champions, each of them is Eva sized. 

Game 3: A team of Majin Buus

Game 4: 1v9, Cthulhu

Bonus: The entire team pilots an infinity Jeager-style (without Godzilla). Who's the strongest foe they can beat? 




 Elizabeth Comstock AKA Anna Dewitt vs the Doctor with his TARDIS

It's good, old-fashioned, time travel race. Starting in Columbia, who can get to Paris in 1983 to catch Revenge of the Jedi first? 




 Evangelion-001, with Shinji as its pilot, fights against legendary pokemon because I assume it would wipe the floor with anything short of legendary. Who's the strongest it can beat? Who's the strongest pokemon all three Evangelions can beat? 




 Typing feels amazing and I just don't want to stop ever. Give me an excuse to keep typing.  




 Elsa has started the eternal winter, so the sun has been blocked out for a day. Superman comes to find her and bring back summer, but is met with that magic blast thing that she nearly killed Anna with. Knowing a kiss from Hans probably won't save his life, Superman has no choice but to fight Elsa. Can she survive the onslaught long enough for Supes to freeze to death? Golden Age Superman, end of the movie Elsa with control of her powers.  









 After the death of Aeris, Cloud becomes a super Saiyan instead of a whiny bitch (looking at you, Advent Children.) 

He gets his Ultima sword and Ultima, KOTR, mega-All, and any other Materia he needs. He would be at max level before the transformation. His hair is really, *really*, blond. Who could he beat? 



















 The battle takes place on Namek because why not. Mewtwo can evolve into one of his Mega-evolutions and Frieza starts in his base form.  









 Midgar from Final Fantasy VII is under attack from the King of Monsters. 

Round 1: Beginning of the game, Cloud has not yet joined AVALANCHE
Round 2: Beginning of the game, level 7 Cloud has Barret and Tifa. 
Round 3: No Cloud, but the city has the Sister Ray. 
Round 4: End of disc 2, during the raid. 
Round 5: 1v1 Cloud vs Godzilla
Round 5.5: Winner gets to call in either Barret and Tifa or Mothra and Rodan is they get stomped too hard. 

Bonus: How does Big G do against the individual Weapons? Ultimate, Diamond, Emerald, and Ruby.  









 The chainsaws are automatically started and never run out of fuel. The shotgun needs to be reloaded but has infinite ammo. Also, the man with the shotgun dick still has his testicles, so he needs to worry about recoil.  




 The new Godzilla was the first one I've seen, and now I really want to see more Godzilla movies. Where can I watch the old ones online and where should I start?  




 The male and female individually, then together.  




 Me neither 



















 Round 1: Marty is 'Clint Eastwood' in the third movie, so he has his Peacemaker and ammo, and access to the hover board. Ash is from Army of Darkness, with either the Chainsaw or his robot hand, plus the Boomstick. 

Round 2: the DeLorean vs the Oldsmobile. The Oldsmobile is the armored version from Army of Darkness, and the DeLorean can't fly and is equipped with the Mr. Fusion, but the Time Circuits are scrambled so Marty can't time travel. It's a race from the Empire State Building to Yankee Stadium. 

Round 3: once they get to Yankee Stadium, it's a car-battle to the death. All of a sudden, the DeLorean can fly again, but still no time travel. 

In all three rounds, Marty has no problem killing Ash.  














 In Super Smash Bros Brawl. Who do they choose and who wins? 

Game rules: no items, Final Destination, 5 minutes, best of 5 rounds

Bonus: let them use the Smash Ball.  









 If your favorite character is already evil enough to control a goatee, they fight themselves with no goatee.  



















 Round 1: 4-way debate about something they know nothing about. 

Round 2: /u/Unidan and Bill Nye vs. Tyson and Mr. Rogers in a team rap battle. 

Round 3: all four have to separately convince Galactus not to consume Earth

Round 4: /u/Unidan and Mr. Rogers are counter-terrorist vs. Nye and Tyson as terrorists in a Counter-Strike (Source because why not). Best of five rounds. 

Round 5: everyone is leading their own equally powerful nation, each the size and wealth of the Cold War USA. Assuming Nye and Tyson don't know how to actually build a rocket, who wins the Space Race?

Round 6: Everyone gets their choice of a Buster Sword, dagger, or one- or two-handed axe. They are dropped into the Capital Wasteland from Fallout 3 one week before the Lone Wanderer escapes and must survive. The first person to find anything from the game can have it. Who lasts the longest? 









 They have to be attractive because of their own charisma, not power of any kind. So no, DOOM can't win because he can tell any Latverian woman to sleep with him.  




 Deadpool and Joker aren't allowed to kill, they just have to rustle as many Jimmies as possible. 

for the lazy: /r/braveryjerk and /r/coaxedintoasnafu 




 I'm running Windows 7 on an HP Pavilion dv6, and after LEGO Marvel Superheroes crashed on me, I was told that Aero ran out of memory and Windows changed to a less memory-intensive theme. But now that I have a whole lot of RAM available, the theme won't change back to the one I had before. I've tried manually changing it back in Control Panel but it didn't work.  




 Protectors of the American way decide to run the country. Who are their running mates, who wins the votes and from which states? Does the winner do a good job and get re-elected or does the loser come back four years later and fix the place?

EDIT: congress has made an amendment so Kryptonians can run.  




 Out of everything, which is the most entertaining way to:

Travel a few blocks
Commute to work
Long-distance road trip (Cross-Country)
Long-Distance (space travel) 




 Anything that he can do as a Kryptonian (so no Super Saiyan transformation, no almost-death-thing whose name escapes me).  




 Raditz gains the ability to come back every time he dies. He's always just as strong as he was at the time of his first death, but he decides to try and take out some of the strongest warriors in the multiverse. 
How many times does he have to try before he wins?
In no particular order, the combatants:

Mewtwo
The Boss (Saints Row IV)
Frieza
Hercules
Super Perfect Cell
Batman
Superman
Deadpool
Wolverine
Thor
Goku (Namek Saga, non-super Saiyan)
Gohan (SSJ2, Cell Games)
Vegeta (peak, non-super Saiyan)
Goku (absolute maximum)

 Goku from Battle of the Gods vs. A basket of week-old kittens.

 [Mewtwo](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mewtwo_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\)) with all its powers from X and Y, including one megastone per fight.  



















 At basketball.  




 Since Godzilla would probably lose to all 700-something Pokemon, how would he fare against only the Pokemon in OU? 


List of current OU:

Aegislash, Alakazam, Azumarill, Bisharp, Blissey, Breloom, Charizard, Clefable, Conkeldurr, Deoxys's Speed form, Ditto, Dragonite, Espeon, Excadrill, Ferrothorn, Galvantula, Garchomp, Genesect, Gengar, Gliscor, Goodra, Greninja, Gyarados, Heatran, Kangaskhan, Klefki, Landorus, Landorus's Therian form, Latios, Lucario, Mamoswine, Mandibuzz, Mawile, Pinsir, Washing Machine Rotom, Scizor, Skarmory, Smeargle, Talonflame, Thundurus, Togekiss, Trevenant, Tyranitar, Venusaur, Volcarona

Banned Items: Soul Dew, Gengarite, Kangaskhanite, Lucarionite

Anything that can mega evolve is allowed to unless its item is banned or hasn't been announced yet.  




 Anna is obviously the younger if the two. Elsa actually came of age on Coronation Day, which would mean Anna is still underage. Why does Anna even consider marriage at all, and why would Elsa not point that out?  




 The battle takes place in my kitchen. Maximum of 30 mins prep time. Both are Bloodlusted

Round 1: Which is more delicious for dinner after a day of work?
Round 2: Maximum power, cooked by an expert of each food. 
Round 3: Both are armed with medieval broadswords. 

Bonus: Which would have an easier time killing Batman? 




 I haven't seen /u/Zoltarr777, /u/DeadeyeSigma, or /u/pokefollower in a while. Where are you guys? It's pretty much just me and /u/toonlink10 left.  




 Rules: No new things out of the blue. It has to have some connection to your actual feats. That's it.  














 All the omnipotent gods (I.e not limited to one region like the Greek or Norse gods) are competing against each other. 

Round 1: who can build the best universe the fastest? Starting with nothing, they must build a utopian paradise and fill it with diverse life, laws of physics, light sources, and anything a civilization would need to survive. 

Round 2: who can build the best world in 6 days? Whose universe would last the longest without all the civilizations tearing each other apart? Given six full days, as long as it took in Genesis, who will win this interdimensional game of Civ?

Round 3: Who can destroy said universe with natural disasters most uniquely? Not just a snap of the fingers and the universe is gone, something like Noah's flood. 

Round 4: bloodlusted fight to the death takes place in a limbo state, a complete absence if anything.  




 Mewtwo is sentient like in the movie, with stats and moves from X and Y. He has a completely filled trainer's bag and has again kidnapped Nurse Joy, as well as a move re-learner. He has both Mega Stones, but can only carry one at a time. His Nurse and Move Tutor stay behind when he goes to fight, so if he wants to heal he has to leave and come back. His goal, using the creation trio to travel between universes, is to take all of them over by killing or recruiting (Mystery Dungeon style) all of their strongest fighters. For example, he has to kill every legendary pokemon who refuses to cooperate, every Godzilla monster, the entire Justice League, etc. Can he do it? If not, who stops him? 




 Mewtwo is encountered in three games, all at level 70: FireRed/LeafGreen, HeartGold/SoulSilver (We're assuming the remakes are canon because they're more recent) and X/Y. The Mewtwo in HGSS is rumored to be Red's Mewtwo after being released, but since HGSS takes place two years after FRLG, this can't be true because Mewtwo is still level 70. If it was released by Red, it would have leveled up by at least one at some point. Levels represent a pokemon's natural growth, with an older pokemon being a higher level due to its age rather than directly being linked to power. In the game, this manifests in levels, but for this theory we'll assume that level=age. This means that Mewtwo is the same age two years later, which can't be possible. Therefore, the Mewtwo as caught by Ethan and Lyra is a different Mewtwo from the one caught by Red and Leaf. Then there's the matter of Calem and Serena's Mewtwo, which is again level 70, and this time there's two in Kalos: Mewtwo X and Mewtwo Y, one for each Mega Stone. It's implied that X and Y take place around the same time as Red and Blue, because Blue was actually in Kalos and the one person who mentioned him doesn't mention that he's a champion or gym leader, meaning at that point he hadn't beaten the Pokemon League yet. This could also be when Sycamore got his hands on Kanto starters, but that's a different theory. So there's two Mewtwos in Kalos, and two in Kanto, albiet at different times. There's another theory stating that the Mewtwo in Kalos is in fact Red's, which ran away to live in secrecy, but it didn't age, so that's out of the question. Since the one Mewtwo we have canon information about, Red's, was the son of Mew, born on February 6, we can assume this means that the three other Mewtwos are also directly the children of Mews. Mewtwo is a mutation of the Mew DNA, meaning Mewtwo can't reproduce stably. The Kanto Mew probably gave birth to both Mewtwos which have inhabited Cerulean Cave (at different times), and the Kalos Mew probably had twin Mewtwos. This isn't even taking into account non-main series games like Mystery Dungeon or Ranger.  




 Assuming he knows how to work a modern car. He also tries to steal as much as he can from Wayne Manor and the Batcave.  









 What are the strongest and weakest characters you can think of, and what's the most balanced battle they could be in?  












































 Sachiel gets the week of prep that Shinji and Asuka got.  









 Let's see if I can keep it going for the rest of 2015 









 A milk jug has been poured out and filled again, but this time with everyone's favorite time-travelling liquid metal (don't worry, that includes the main processor). Who can it beat? Who can beat it? 

Bonus: Who could beat [3.033*10^8 T-1000s combined into one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/2qvxg4/request_if_several_t1000s_terminator_2_could_melt/cnagnh0) 









 Legendary's new Godzilla to be specific 




 Would they be able to effectively come together to form a single unified being or would they be too separate? 









 Why does this exist? Eating tiny food to restore a percent or two at a time to get to 0% WITHIN TWO MINUTES. WHILE AN ORGY OF DEDEDES ARE CONSTANTLY UNDOING MY PROGRESS. ON THE BIGGEST STAGE IN THE GAME. I mean, for fucks sake make the good bigger or something do I can fucking SEE it. And all the stage hazards can OHKO you if god decides you haven't suffered enough. Fuck you, whoever made this event. 




 I've owned this game for over a year now and I still have no god damned clue how Caravan is played.  




 That shit is so cash I need it on my body.  




 The fight takes place in Daten City. Everyone gets six hours of prep time. 

Bonus: all three of them vs. Evangelion's angels 














 Alternatively, A Miracle on Elm Street 









 Also, is he technically a magical girl a la Sailor Moon? 









 I swear to God there is a method to my madness 




 In the theatrical cut if Army of Darkness, Ash returns to his time and saves the day from a Deadite at S-Mart. In the Director's Cut ending, we see he sleeps a century too long. The assumption is that this is the effect of a Third World War while he was asleep. But what if it was the result of the return of the Deadites during the extra century? He isn't awake to stop the Deadite at S-Mart, so that Deadite was able to take over the world starting from there.  









 The year is 2014. the King of Kings has gotten fed up with jolly old Saint Nick hogging the spotlight on the celebration of *His* birth. So, he challenges him to a competition. If Jesus wins, he gets Christmas. If Santa wins, Jesus backs down as humanity's messiah and God's right hand. 

RULES: Unless specified, Jesus doesn't get to use any feats from Revelation. He is out of character, and willing to fight rather than just pacify the situation. Santa gets his feats from all depictions **of him**. That is to say, Saint Nicholas gets feats from his various depictions. Other Santas, like Arthur Christmas, Futurama's Santa, the Grinch, Odin, and Tim Allen, **all don't count toward Santa's feats**. As long as it's Nick himself, everything else is fair game. 

Round 1: Standard bout. Post-Crucifixion Jesus Christ (PCJC). Takes place in Jerusalem. Santa gets two days of prep, no weapons. 

Round 2: They switch jobs. Jesus has to deliver all the presents, Santa has rule over the world for a night. Whoever does the other's job better wins. 

Round 3: Jesus' Super Smash Bros game of choice. Both will be using gamecube controllers (because let's be real it isn't the N64 game). Santa gets a month of training with the top competitive Smash players. 

Round 4: Swimsuit competition. 

Round 5: They are both tasked with converting an extremely cynical, closed-minded atheist to believing in them. Whoever can make him believe first without pulling anything supernatural wins.  







































 World War III has been initiated by the Illuminati and now the POTUS is the mot stereotypical American possible: fat, gun-loving, communazi-hating, overly consumerist, favorite movie is probably Saving Private Ryan or something, you know who I'm talking about. The rest of the planet is either ruled by the Fourth Reich or the Communist Empire (I'm creative, I know). Siding with either is a guaranteed victory with the same spoils for America, choosing to side with neither is guaranteed destruction. 

EDIT: BONUS ROUND: There is a fourth army in this war, led by Magneto. His army is significantly smaller and the same strength as the Commies and Nazis. Again, the only change in this is who is helping America, they will still win no matter who they choose.  




 DMX has challenged the X-Men in the most honorable of battles: a rap battle. The X-men must choose their greatest battle rapper to accept the challenge. They both get a week of prep. The X-Men aren't allowed to manipulate DMX's rapping. Who is the best rapper in the mutant world? Can they win, or is X Gonna Give it to Them? 




 What if the x.xx titles aren't meant to be pronounced "one point one one" or "one point eleven" (apply as needed to sequels). Maybe the titles are meant to be irrational numbers, like x/9. They would be pronouced x.x *repeating*. Maybe it;s nothing, but I thought it was neat.  



















 I want to main Sailor Moon, but at the same time I don't want to pour all my time into Mii Fighter only to find out that I can't play competitively.  




 So John Connor (as he appears in Judgement Day) is drafted by NERV to pilot their newest Eva model, the E-800. Obviously, we know where Sarah is in this situation. Because Third Impact has been avoided in this continuity, NERV now blows their government funding on giant robot fights for sport. These fights have pilots get in their Evas, but then the Evas are forced to go berserk because... reasons. The berserk mama bears fight in an arena setting. How does Sarah Connor fare against...

1) Eva-00

2) Eva-02

3) The MP-Eva series

4) The Angels (yeah, we cloned the Angels back to life. What are you gonna do?

4) Eva-01

All Evas are, of course, berserk. 

TL;DR Who has the best mom in all of Evangelion and/or Terminator? 




 He experiences the game as the player would, save for one thing. He carries a chainsaw out of Vault 101 with him. When Amata closes the vault door, he attempts to get back in but ends up getting his hand stuck in the door. He has to cut it off and attach the chainsaw to the stump. Now he's on his own in the Wastes. 

Victory conditions: 

Create his own army and dominate the wasteland. 

Complete the entire game, DLC included

Become known from DC to New Vegas 




 One time this werewolf motherfucker came into this apple store and started playing the default ringtone on his iPhone so everyone would have to check their phones. Not only that, but he downloaded terabytes of foot fetish porn onto the laptops. So subtle, that sneaky sneaky wolf. And the worst part? It was all legal.  









 1: Freestyle rapping

2: general rhyming

3: texting

4: Creating chaos

5: coining catchphrases

6: horrifying obsession over a coworker

7: a battle of pure coyness. Coyest diva left standing wins.  









 The Inner Senshi as they appear at the end of the original 90s anime (that is to say Sailor Moon, not Sailor Moon R). Kaworu is his Manga/TV incarnation, not Mr. Yaoi-no-Powers from 3.33. Fight takes place in the abandoned city of Tokyo-3. Everyone is in character.  









 Gamzilla uses the collective feats of both.  



















 I can't tell if it's the most commie shit or the most patriotic shit I've ever heard. 

He said he wished he weren't form the USA, so he could experience America for the very first time.

I'm still really unsure about this one.  




 Kaworu is revealed as the final angel and NERV decides not to deploy Unit-01. Instead, they send in their newest ally- the Silver Surfer. Who wins? Does humanity come out of this in multiple pieces? Both are in-character, and let's use Manga Kaworu because he's the coolest.  




 Your top 5 (try to keep them human-scale, with a maximum of like 10 feet) characters go to an abandoned cabin in the woods. They read from the Necronomicon and summon some Candarian demons. Who gets possessed first, will the others survive or will they all be Dead by Dawn?

BONUS: The last survivor gets dragged into the third movie. Will they protect the Necronomicon from the deadites? 






















































 From [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/GODZILLA/comments/2mowgl/finally_found_bc_godzilla_2014/) post on /r/Godzilla.

This team includes 4 T-800s with varying levels of damage and 2 Legendary Godzillas. Who can they beat? Who can beat them? 









 Three-way Battle of the Bands. They're only allowed to use their feats from these songs.  


































 Like, how many of you will actually talk about Lord Arceus when religion comes up in conversation? Do you answer "Arceist" to the question of religion?  









 Assume the kaiju aren't going to act like assholes while off duty. They have to defend the crucified Lilith from the angels in the same manner as the original anime, starting with Sachiel. NERV will find the Lance of Longinus at the same time that they originally did. They also get to use the A.T. Field things that Unit-13 had in 3.33. 

**If the team gets angelstomped too hard, they can start again with these modifications. 

Godzilla is the version from Final Wars. **Also gets Spacegodzilla

Mothra is also her FW incarnation. **Mothra Leo with all his BS tranformations

Rodan is Fire Rodan because regular Rodan sucks. **Also gets Megaguirus. 

King Ghidorah is his GvKG incarnation, and if he ever dies he can be rebuilt as Mecha King Ghidorah. **Replaced by Desghidorah, 

Mechagodzilla is Kiryu from Tokyo SOS. **Kiryu and MOGUERA (from Spacegodzilla)

EDIT: Also when Tabris does arrive instead of seducing Shinji he seduces Minya.  




 We all know the A.T. Field is a total Deus Ex Machina in these types of battles, so here are the rules:

No removing the A.T. Field with magic or other A.T fields/Anti-A.T. fields. 

No reality warping (we promise Unit-01 won't go all Third Impact)

Eva-01 is post-Zeruel (has an S^2 engine) and berserk. 

No mind controlling Unit-01.  
























 The combined cast of: Godzilla (all of them in their most recent film incarnations) and Pacific Rim, plus Clove, Clifford the Big Red Dog, several explicitly named Pokemon, and Gamera are put onto one island arena. No one is allowed to leave (think Destroy all Monsters). This is where your fave comes in. They are parachuted into the middle of the island with nothing but their usual gear and a GPS showing where any given kaiju is located. Can your favorite character kill every kaiju on the island? 

Kaiju list:

Godzilla: Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah, Rodan, Gigan, Mechagodzilla (70s), both MUTOs, Zilla, Orga, Baragon, Varan, Biollante, Destoroyah, Spacegodzilla, Hedorah, and Minya. 

Pacific Rim: Onibaba, Knifehead, Yamarashi, Mutavore, Leatherback, Otachi, Raiju, Scunner, Slattern 

Pokemon: Groudon, Kyogre, Rayquaza, Ho-Oh, Lugia, Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres

BONUS: They get to call in one Mass Production Evangelion for help, BUT all the kaiju will bum-rush them.  




 All of these fighters can be argued as messiah figures after J-Dawg's own image. 

This is post-crucifixion Jesus

1: Gordon Freeman. All weapons allowed. (He's beloved, bearded, messianic supersoldier)

2: The Terminator 2 T-800 (Half man, stuggles between being objectively superior to humans and also being a human. Saves the world from its own hubris. Pretty much applies from here on out)

3: Kaworu Nagisa, Evangelion

4: Eva Unit-01, Shinji piloting

5: Eva Unit-01, berserk

6: Post-Crisis Superman

7: Superman Prime 1M

And any others you think should be on the list.  














 If you've got a loser and a Jew well deserving of a Sunday blast, write about that diva roach here. AKA! 














 The fight takes place in Tokyo on a full moon. They both get a month of prep time.  




 Is that robosexuality, even though she's an angel with a human's soul inside the robot? 


































 Specifically Unit-06 from End of Eva I guess. 

Bonus: all the EVEs on the ship vs one Eva 














 This one kind of operates on the assumption that Time Loop Theory is true, but realistically we all know it is. Especially Anno. 

Mari is the backup pilot for Unit-02, when it's made clear in NGE (and *heavily* implied in Rebuild) that Eva pilots can only do so because the soul inside the Eva is their mother, which allows for them to synch properly. Asuka is the designated pilot of Unit-02, because the soul of Kyoko is inside it (her?). When Asuka is out of commission following Unit-03's activation and possesion by Bardiel, Mari takes over as pilot of 02. But she shouldn't be able to, because no one named Illustrious is the soul of 02. Not only should she not be able to pilot it, but she unlocked its ability to transform (which Asuka later ended up using). If Rebuild is truly post-EoE, Kyoko could have brought herself back from the sea of LCL as her perfect self (look how similar [they](http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/122523.jpg) [are](http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/4479/384373-makinami_mari_illustrious74_large.jpg)) in order to continue protecting the next Asuka. This Asuka, however, was not her equivalent's child, due to the fact that the original was still around. This Asuka belonged to someone with the name of Shikinami. That person was presumably another scientist at Gehirn (potentially even the doctor that original Asuka's dad hooked up with when Kyoko was in the hospital) who then became new Unit-02. This would explain the redesign and upgrade. As a soul formerly known as an Eva, she is also able to pilot Unit-05 and Mark.08.  





























 I just got finished rewatching 3.33 to try and figure out why I don't like it. Maybe this has something to do with me not having seen any Eva for a month or so, but I found myself actually enjoying it more the second time around. So what *did* go wrong? What went right? Should it be considered as bad as some consider it?

Well for starters, about half of the movie is exposition or setup with no real answers. You have the opening, AKA "Get out of the fucking robot, Shinji". Then you have Shinji trying to make nice with "Rei", then the only character development in this movie (which to be fair is quite good at making you care for both Kaworu and Shinji), then "We reveal what everyone already figured out halfway through 2.22 even if you didn't see the original" with Fuyutsuki, then  "Get in the fucking robot, Shinji" from Kaworu, Kaworu explains what *Totally* happened during "Near"-Third Impact (seriously we saw you impale him with the Cassius what the hell), then Kaworu says some cryptic shit interlaced with the fight against WILLE and then the movie ends. This movie fails in a few regards because of this: NGE had very little explanation, leaving most exposition up to a few cryptic conversations where much is spoken but not much is said. This leaves the viewer to come up with their own conclusions as to what was going on in EoE, or what SEELE's motivations were. These questions make sure NGE stays in the viewer's mind, making it one of the most memorable stories in all of history. 3.33 tries to repeat this, but where it falls short is that most of the questions it leaves have only one logical answer. "What is the Vessel of Adams?" it makes the viewer wonder, then they think and say "Oh, wait, it probably has something to do with the Angels and Instrumentality. Rei-ish is probably like Kaworu with boobs and a bowl cut". NGE had questions with *really* ambiguous answers that are so open-ended that they are still being debated to this day. 3.33 tries to be a regular movie where all your questions are answered so any unanswered questions become plot holes, but also tries to keep its artsy "leave shit up to the viewer" movie like End of Eva. 

3.33 also had very little character development As a follow-up to 2.22, we already know most of these characters. We know who the main characters are (or at least are meant to be, some of the more complex characters like Asuka have had life sucked out of them in favor of being a 2D tsundere with no real character whatsoever to the point where I've started calling her Asuka-ish). But these characters have become different people to who they were 14 years prior. They either needed more development or none at all. Pick one. And then they have the balls to throw in a new character with no development whatsoever in Mari "Deus Ex" Makinami. She just shows up during action sequences to be a comic foil to Asuka-sh and fetish material to everyone else (because the original had *nothing* to say about fetishizing teenage girls in anime. DAMNIT ANNO DID YOU EVEN WATCH EVANGELION). Whereas NGE was almost entirely character with little to no exposition, occasionally broken up by giant robot action, 3.33 was the exact opposite, being no character and lots of exposition/robots. 

That being said, what 3.33 does right, it does *right*. The new robots look great (they even have a 'Mark.# naming system so we don't confuse them with the Mass Production Evas). Kaworu and Shinji share some great chemistry together, some of the scenes are pretty damn atmospheric, and the hellish imagery is greatly effective, even some of the more subtle things like Shinji being the third thing they removed from Unit-01, and it's implied that what they found in there wasn't even human. There is a lot that's left to the imagination, like what else they retrieved from Unit-01, or what how Kaworu planned to use the spears. But it's held down by the fact that it's nothing but a retread of Episode 24 of the original, which tries to explain things but keeps holding itself back for that unique street cred. 

So is 3.33 as bad as some people say? I actually have two answers. As a standalone movie, or even as the third movie in the Rebuild saga (independent from NGE) I'd say it's pretty good. No masterpiece, but it's a decent sequel to 2.22 and presumed prequel to 3.0+1.0. The character development does leave some things to be desired, but it does a good job of not holding your hand. The hellish imagery adds a lot to the overall quality and it's appropriately subtle in a lot of places. Rebuild is a must-watch for any fan of Mecha. 

As an Evangelion movie, however, I'm gonna go ahead and say it's almost, but not quite, fucking garbage. It is the antithesis to everything Neon Genesis stands for, from its bland characters (except maybe Kaworu), to its "baby's first mindfuck" approach to Fourth Impact, to its sine-waving between Evangelion's "open to interpretation" plot and an easy to understand plot. Holding it up to the original, it's NOT subtle in any way, shape, or form. Obviously it's more subtle than Pacific Rim or Gurren Lagann, but it lacks the meta commentary, complex characters, and even the heart of NGE. The first half completely ignores the rest of Eva and effectively resets the universe, while the second half is just a drawn-out, over-the-top version of Episode 24. Rebuild (I've dropped the 'Of Evangelion' in the hopes that it might become true) has to make up for this with 3.0+1.0 if it wants any credibility. Just watch the last three episodes and you'll be good.  














 Does the [choral section after the guitar solo](http://youtu.be/k9zcjnEyKjc?t=1m45s) have any particular lyrics or is it just vocalization? I can't find any lyrics for them, but they are consistent throughout every single cover of the song.  









 Edit: for whatever *reason*. God damnit.  







































 Space-G has to fight every single pokemon. The fight takes place in that region's city, which Space-G has made his new fortress of solitude. Which regions can he defeat? Which regions defeat him?

Note: Especially for Gen IV, we are using whichever incarnation is most reasonable for the fight (e.g. giant Groudon. but no omnipotent Arceus) 



















 After Gendo Ikari is "eaten" by a naked Unit-01 during Third Impact, his soul is added to Instrumentality. The world he exists in and refuses to return from after Giant Naked Rei is killed is the one that exists in Rebuild. The first is a complete retread of his memories, knowing what he knows he added some things from the real world (red seas, MP-Eva outline) he sees where he went wrong and could make a change in regards to Shinji, by adding a new person to the mix, namely Mari Ilustrious Makinami. The reason she's a Mary Sue is because she represents Gendo's paradise, not unlike Kaworu for Shinji. Speaking of gay alien Jesus, he remembers the original because he's an Angel, and therefore infiltrated Gendo's world, once again like for Shinji. In Gendo's perfect world, he kills SEELE, the only people who were stopping his Instrumentality scenario. Going back to EoE, in his final moments, Gendo regretted his treatment of Shinji and his last words were an apology to his son. So all the *slightly* not-as-shitty-but-still-mostly-shit that Shinji suffers through in Rebuild (not being able to see the Dummy System kill Bardiel, not killing Kaworu with his own hands, being a hero and getting the girl in 2.22, etc.) was a result of that.  




 I have a piano that I want to learn to play it on while I sing. Five seconds in Google only turned up guitar tabs and the wrong song.  














 [Here's the lyrics in both Japanese and English.](http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/neongenesisevangelion/acruelangelsthesis.htm) 




 Who takes the role of:

The Whore, The Athlete, The Fool, The Scholar, and the Virgin (work with what we have)

What horror do they summon? Are the old gods appeased?  



















 I'm a singer and I want to perform a song in the name of our Lord. Is there anything I can do without knowing how to play an instrument?

It has come to my attention that the answer is no. I'll see if I can find some free time to create some vocal music.  




 As a gift, my mom is buying me a 760, or something in that price range. I need to know what parts I should get to match, preferably around $500.  



















 **Name:** Amir Valerie Blumenfeld (also goes by "Vance", "DJ Schmumu", and various combinations of his name and "Jacob Hurwitz")

**Identification code:** 425862-JA-IIWY

**Biography:** This prisoner's past is inconsistent at best. As best we can gather, he was brought illegally from Canada to New York state, where his abusive parents raised him, teaching him to drive at 4. He was verbally and physically abused, and every time he was deemed a disappointment, his father moved houses. It is known that Amir was neighbors with a child named Penis Anthony Dooblinge (who recently changed his name to Roboert Cut off my own Penis Fatty Fatty Narr Narr Smoke A Bowl Full Of Sour Cream Veggie Burrito Penis) Amir was abducted from a shopping mall when he was six years of age and returned at the age of 11. He had forgotten how to speak and survived on a diet of chicken nuggets, a diet which still persists into his 30s. He repeated second grade an apparent total of 8 times, then managed to reach sixth grade without talking for four years, when he did eventually speak he was returned to second grade due o his illiteracy in math and English. It is unknown how much time passed before he got an internship at Collegehumor, where he still works, with no apparent job despite being employed. As a result of his upbringing, he seems to suffer from delusions of grandeur. 

**Known crimes:** Innumerable counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault, arson, prank calls to 911, attempted robbery on a subway, libel against an airline (awaiting a ruling form the jury) lying under oath, stalking, stabbing a coworker (Jake Hurwitz), several counts of animal abuse (a snake, a kidnapped dog, several animals he brutally murdered just to wear as accessories), sexual harassment, breaking and entering (at least two counts), armed robbery, destruction of property, public nudity, stealing from sleeping homeless women, assaulting police officers, and kidnapping the child of an officer. 

**Summary of capture:** A co-worker (Jake Hurwitz) alerted us about the dangerous nature of his actions and of the crimes he's committed. We waited at Jake's apartment until Amir attempted to break in, at which point we arrested him. 

**Sentence:** Amir clearly suffers symptoms of schizophrenia. He is to be given a therapist to help with his mental illness. For the crimes he has committed, he is to be given a life sentence with no probation. 

**Containment Notes:** Do not be fooled by Amir's weak, underweight body. He has more than enough strength to break out of a minimum security cell. He has the apparent ability to teleport, despite being a mortal human. He is to be locked in, with guards watching him at all times. Once his reeducation and rehabilitation are complete, he can be moved to a lower security and given probation.  




 1: a straight-up 3-way fight between them. Mothra has laid her egg and therefore can come back as two larvae if she so chooses. 

2: Who would do the best doing the other two's jobs? (ie. Aquaman vs Godzilla AND Aquaman vs pollution)

3: Who could they beat together?

4: How many Hedorahs would it take to defeat them? 
























 Baragon has apparently never won a single battle. Who's the strongest fighter he could fight in order to break his losing streak?  


































 I need to know what this looks like.  





























 The JSSDF scrapped the Jet Alone project after the episode 7 incident, and decided to instead work on a much better nuclear mecha to rival NERV's Eva-series. The JSSDF plans on raiding the Geofront using an army of Kiryus. Units 00 and 02 have been put into suspension at the time of the attack, so NERV only has Unit-01 to defend themselves. Shinji decides to stop being a bitchly and get in the fucking robot for once. 

Each Kiryu has an S^2 engine so they won't run out of power, but they still can't cast an AT field

Bonus: Could Kiryu beat one Mass Production Evangelion (who have no AT fields, but do have the heavy spear)?

Bonus II: Could one Kiryu succeed where Asuka failed and take out all the MP-Evas? The power issues Kiryu has are back for this round

Bonus III: How many Kiryus would it take to kill *every* Evangelion? Rebuild units included. That's 00, 01, 02, Bardiel, 04 (who is presumably the same as unit-02), Unit-05, Mark VI, Unit-08, Unit-09, and Unit-13

 Cave Johnson has accidentally done a Second Impact. Now, because there is no Gehirn or SEELE in this world, Aperture Science has to be the ones to kill the Angels. They are also housing GLaDOS, who was built from Lilith now. If the Angels get to her, Third Impact will happen and GLaDOS will have failed. She has all the resources available in both Portal and the Half-Life games. Can she do it? Who does she use as a pilot I'd she figures out the Evangelion plans?

Things that now exist from Evangelion: AT fields, the Dead Sea Scrolls Apocrypha, the Lance of Longinus.

GLaDOS can also build Evangelions and the Positron Accelerator, but needs to research and invent them. She has 15 years after Second Impact until Sachiel attacks to build.
