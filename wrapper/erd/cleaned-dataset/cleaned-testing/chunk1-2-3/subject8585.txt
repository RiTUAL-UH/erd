 Sort of like explaining procreation to a 6 year old?  




 I had a toothache and with a little clove oil I got through it until I was seen by a dentist but I've stubbed my toe and tripped and fell directly on my knees and both times the pain was so great I THREW UP! Throw up pain is bad! 




 Here!, Here! Debating a Creationist about D's evolutionary theory and thinks that evolution says dogs can become chickens is like debating football vs soccer when said football fan thinks soccer can only be played with your ass. 




 Are you referring to the USA's general population or the rest of the educated population in the world? If you mean the USA then yes. 




 "Look at the Big Bang theory, please. Nothing exists, then everything does. Sounds like something that could be caused by an omnipotent deity if you ask me. Until that theory has been disproved, creationism hasn't either."

The problem with this logic is that the BBT and more importantly, Evolution can be disproved. That's what make it a scientific theory. This is referred to as the Popperian Princible. So far, Darwinian evolution hasn't been disproved and has, in fact, fit in quite nicely with other areas of scientific study such as geology, cosmology, and biology to name but a few.

Unlike Evolution, Creationism or ID can not be proved nor disproved because the supposed force(God) that created the universe operated supernaturally or outside the bounds of the physical world and since there is no way to test the "God did it" hypothesis it can not be regarded as a scientific theory.  

The question is not that creationism is false, maybe God really did plant fossilized dino feces to throw us off, it more that it's not science and shouldn't be taught as a competing scientific theory. 




 Just watched their parent's divorce? Were you the other woman? 




 I only got to the part where the dirt poor rural Kenyan got a text message. 




 I haven't seen this and I've been here for a year but maybe I only check it for an hour or two instead of surfing 12 hours+ till your eyeballs get tired. Sorry you're jealous but maybe timing is everything. Get a real life and good luck! 




 Christians were rarely subjected to or even sought out to be the victims of the Roman tortures of the Colosseums but the writers of Christian history want you to believe this because it makes good ticket. 

The Roman Empire, in expanding their empire, wanted to enjoin their conquered territories by allowing fully religious protocol of the future citizens to the citizen of Rome.  Bureaucracy being what is was and sadly what it is now, made citizens of conquered nations taxpayers but not enough to make a difference.

The book I was presented with as a kid that showed Christians being thrown to the so called "lion" was DISHONEST at the least and MISLEADING.  




 Sure, I'll validate that if you can give an explanation to my question. 




 I so wish that people would just say I don't know instead of giving it a spin! 




 Why in the heck would some sort of God that has existed forever, want or need anything!  Still foggy here. 




 The Bible starts with "In the beginning". I take that as only life on Earth and not time before. Most Christians would say their God has existed forever. If so, what were the motives during all this infinite time that would cause a perfect being to suddenly create anything? 




 I would venture to say that people that are impoverished and have no hope of any other kind of existence would welcome a religion that rewarded their suffering in this life for promises of eternal peace after death. 




 You make some pretty sound arguments for poverty before religion.  As a whole I would agree that Christianity in particular appeals to those that are poor. Several passages support the idea that rich folk can't go to heaven and the poor have a better chance of salvation.  Mother Theresa subscribed to this even though she, herself had the best healthcare money could buy.  

My view is that some religions make an individual"s circumstance concerning poverty or wealth an attribute or a hindrance. The Buddha came from wealth and gave everything away to understand why men suffer. But, unlike the Buddha who chose to teach how to achieve Nirvana in a lifetime, Christianity pushes believers toward death. That the only good thing to come out of a life of misery awaits after you're gone and some religions will say that if you tow the line, and accept your lot in life, your rewards in an afterlife are guaranteed. Sounds like a lot of bullcrap from ppl that are on top and want the majority of struggling ppl to stay complacent to me. 




 You bring up an interesting subject. Why were humans created with different sexual organs? If Adam just needed a friend then god could have just made another man. Since he didn't, was it his intention for Adam and Eve to have sex for pure pleasure since they would live forever? Maybe it was his back up plan just in case he had to punish them. If so, Eve still would have menstruated. Maybe he just added the whole reproduction thing like an after market add-on after the fall?  Either way, he could have designed the whole thing better so he owes me an apology in my opinion. 
BTW: guys don't have periods silly! 




 I was thinking the same thing! 




 You've made a pretty good correlation between religion and poverty. What is the point you're trying to make if any? Are you implying poverty causes ppl to be religious or that wealth makes ppl less likely to be religious?  To get to a conclusion you must present an explanation or a "why" to explain causation.  Correlation does not equal causation. 

Texas, for example has many wealthy ppl who are also very religious.
Hypothetically, you may have a town with a high number of churches and also a high number of alcoholics.  Are there lots of churches because there are lots of drunks or is it the other way around (most likely the case in my opinion)  and if it is the latter then why?
 




 You really ought to take care before you dismiss a viewpoint as ignorant. The Mongul Invasion didn't occur until the 13th century. The decline of Intellectualism began over 100 years earlier. To make this easier for you here is a link to that ignorant astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson.

 If Islamic fundamentalism hadn't overshadowed the progressive thinking of that time, a great deal of Nobel winners would have been Muslim. 




 The cynical response of Burgess to a young political aspirant is indicative that the politicians understand the games that are played.  




 Most of the known stars were discovered and named by Islamic scholars and given Arabic names during the enlightened period of 800-1100 ad. Then fundamentalism sent in.......... 




 Not sure about the becoming part but I was born an atheist. lol 




 I'm not surprised. Saw all the movies as a kid but didn't read the book until I was an adult and understood the humanity of his creation and their downfall. As to your question, the answer is yes and he has "some splaining to do! 




 Yes, ask Frankenstein.

Mary Shelly addressed this very question and the horror of the conclusion she came to sums up the relationship of a creator vs the created and the responsibility one has to the other. The evil the story of Frankenstein presents is how a creator can create life and, because of the creator's and society's rejection and lack of guidance and compassion, the creation became a monster when he didn't start out that way. Science is not the culprit but only the vehicle that allows Frankenstein to realize his real mistake/sin in turning his back on his creation out of fear and self-preservation. In this story he ultimately died for it.



 




 Scripture records Jesus as saying he is the Son of Man. This floored me when I went to my first Catholic service but I dutifully looked it up.

The expression "the Son of man" occurs 81 times in the Greek text of the four Canonical gospels, and is used only in the sayings of Jesus. 




 This is off subject but I'm curious about your flair (Pedestrian). I was a practicing Buddhist when I asked my soon to be step-sons, 7   8, what their religious denomination was. They told me they were Pedestrians. Stifling a laugh I found out that their Mom was a Presbyterian.   




 Philosophically, if there is no beginning and no end then there can never be a "now" because it would take an eternity to depart or arrive at any single point. The symbol of a snake eating itself is illustrative of this concept of an impossibility albeit a primitive one. I believe that time as a force or natural law is real. The problem seems to be how time can exist within the concept of eternity. 




 If there was no beginning and no end then.....how would there ever be a middle?  You would spend eternity catching up to or looking back at some point in time. If eternity exists then time itself is meaningless. 




 Think about it. It just is. 




 If you were given a book that had no beginning nor end and asked to stop somewhere in between you wouldn't be able to. 

The Christian god is given many attributes such as supernatural, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and omni benevolent. All of these definitions fall short and so the definition of the Christian God can not be defined. If your God can't be defined then all reference can't be used. 




 Regardless of whether one demerit eventually did or did not affect your weekend pass the fact that you received any kind of negative actions based on your religious views is unacceptable. 

I hope that when you are in the "fleet" you stand fast to your moral code and, as an officer, support those that want to be true to their own and not have to slide by.  




 Is there a subreddit for the KKK? 




 I'm guessing you affirmed and dropped the last part and only had to do this once. What kind of demerits did they give you if any?  




 A client on my Meals on Wheels route turned 90. She told me last week her birthday was coming up and her family, which doesn't visit often except for her daughter, was going to celebrate it with cake even though she has told them she can't stand regular cake. So my husband and I brought her a slice of Oreo cheesecake and 2 chocolate covered strawberries on our next visit. She was so happy she gave both of us a big hug. I think she was happy, not for the cheesecake or the gesture, but that someone really listened to her. 




 cafe'=coffee, "like the drink only spelled different" 




 Have you ever done that and made eye contact with someone else with their head up? My favorite is making eye contact with someone who is devout but peeks around to see whose head is not bowed. I refer to them as the prayer police and I always give them a wink and a smile. 




 From my first enlistment to my last(4th), I affirmed and dropped the "so help me God". That said, it can be a situation where you "out" yourself to your shipmates and Command which, if your chain-of-command is hostile to atheism, can lead to some hassles. Fortunately, because of a split-tour and a decommissioning, my reenlistments were toward the end of my tours; not that I ever hid my religious views. I did however, always seek out someone that I trusted to be open-minded to reenlist me.  




 Maybe they lied too. Were there any consequences if you didn't say it? 




 Upvote above if you remember this song. 




 I depends on what branch of service you're in and when you came in. Things were a lot different for older veterans than younger ones. I'm glad you weren't forced to attend services vice clean the barracks. Sounds like some improvements have been made! 




 Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands all have Humanist Chaplains. There you go! 




 Just curious, what branch of service are you referring to. In the Navy, in all but the most extreme situations, no one had to get approval from anyone and the mental health counselor was under no obligation to report your issues to the CO/XO/CMC unless the situation warranted it. Further more, unless you told someone no one would even know.  




 Neil, do you think think this will make any difference in the minds of Americans. There have been so many good writers from Carl Sagan to Steven Gould but, to me, it doesn't seem to have made one iota as far as changing people's minds. 




 I give you this, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8M74ufF4Q. 




 You said, " I've never felt so powerless or ashamed of something going on in front of me but it helped solidly build within me the sense that you always stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves.

Read my post here. I felt the same way and I felt more shame because I was an adult in the military, knew right from wrong but because I was trying to hide a mental health issue I couldn't do anything. That's my albatross and I can't change it.  




 The last time I went to church I was in the Navy and went because I lost a bet with a Catholic friend. The bet had nothing to do with religion. The base Chaplain and I were friends and he knew I was an atheist. I pulled the Chaplain aside before service began and asked what I should do during the Eucharist. Before he answered me he asked why I was there. When I told him I had lost a bet he gave me a big grin and looked over at my friend, gave him a wink and told me to just cross my arms over my chest. He was the best Chaplain I've ever served with in my entire Navy career.  

PS: I'd never been to a Catholic mass before and I was surprised that they refer to Jesus as the "Son of Man" and not the "Son of God".   




 Did she live in Texas? 




 Definitely real. I can see the dudes left foot sticking out.  




 It's got a lot of wood though. 




 I learned later in life she had a weight problem as a teenager. My Godfather wasn't with us which was also unusual. I suspect they were having marital problems and my off-hand comment fed into her fear and insecurities so she took it out on six year old me. 




 Dumb. 




 I visited the Assembly of God, otherwise known as Holy-Rollers, when I was 12. I grew up Episcopalian so the speaking in tongues and flailing around on the floor was a shock to say the least. 

To call a family out like that on Easter seems almost medieval if not mean spirited!

 




 I was six when my parents divorced. I was sent to live with my Godparents who were also family. One night my Godmother took me and her kids to a pizza place for dinner which was a little unusual. After finishing my first slice of pizza I remarked to my cousin that my Godmother had already eaten three slices. I don't remember why I said this, maybe I just was commenting on how hungry she was or something but the next thing I knew she told me to sit there and eat the rest of all the pizza left, more than half of 2 large pies and took her kids and left to stay in the car. Not knowing why she was angry I started to stuff my face with pizza. After a while I realized I couldn't eat it all and I broke down crying. She sent my cousins back in to hurry me up but they could see I was upset and couldn't finish so they went back out to her car, told her I couldn't finish and then she came back in and boxed up all the pizza left over. We went home and she told me to sit at the dining room table and finish all the pizza. At this point I was scared and sick and didn't know what to do. I refused to eat anymore so she spanked(beat) me with a oak paddle in the shape of a hand that was 1/2" thick and then sent me to bed which I shared with my cousin who berated me for causing problems.  

Sort of tearing up just remembering this. I told my Mom many years afterwards and she could never eat pizza again. I've never told anyone else but it feels good to tell it here. ;) 




 Wow! On Easter Sunday no less. Do you remember what denomination it was?  Were you parents there? 




 I bet that guy still tells that story and laughs about it! 




 How is this public humiliation? 




 In the Navy they teach leaders to praise in public and punish in private. Even Non-judicial Punishments are conducted in private except on very rare occasions. Not all "leaders" understand this concept. On my ship (DDG), the Leading Petty Officer, Leading Chief and Department Head Officer all stood by the motto of "Motivation by Humiliation".

During a 4-day underway a young Seaman Recruit was found out to be wearing bicycle shorts for underwear and he had only brought one pair. Not satisfied with a private verbal counseling and a written warning our pipsqueak of an LPO decided he had the authority to conduct a "mini-NJP" in front of everyone in his workcenter which also included females.

He had the SR put on his Dress Blues and deliver a speech about hygiene and the proper underwear that can be worn. The LPO instructed everyone beforehand to ask many questions in order to mock and humiliate him. The SR barely managed to make it through the ordeal without breaking down mainly because he knew some of us were disgusted with the LPO's gleeful delight in bullying and stomping on the dignity of someone he cared less about. His favorite thing to smugly hum was "Another One Bites the Dust".  




 How many redditors have "In the Navy" playing in your head right now? 




 We have that in the USA too. Taste like a mustard chip. Not bad if you like mustard. 




 true religion=$$$$$$$ 




 Jesus loves me this I know
For the the Bible tells me so.
Little ones to Him belong
They are weak but he is strong.

Yes, Jesus loves me, yes Jesus loves me,
Yes Jesus loves me, the Bible tells me so.

This made me question God when I was 6 and still brings chills up my spine whenever I here it!
 




 When I went through boot-camp I was a practicing Atheistic Buddhist.  I was fortunate that a HM1 was allowed to hold "services" for me and a few other curious individuals. I was also allowed to use candles and incense in the barracks at my first duty station. The biggest problem on my first ship was my snoring! I was in the middle rack and got kicked, accidentally stepped on before I was diagnosed with sleep apnea. 

I'm curious as to what ridicule and discrimination you experienced.  




 We have an enlisted rate in the Navy. It's called RP or Religious Personnelman. Your job is to know all the different requirements of most religions and assist the Chaplain. If your unit has no Chaplain, you're it, so to speak. You can be of any religious bent or none. 

I knew an atheist Navy enlisted member whose rate was stagnant and couldn't be promoted. He decided to cross-rate to an RP because of the advancement opportunity and he was open-minded to members of all religious views or none and he eventually attained the rank of Chief. He neither judged or restricted any sailors requests nor their immediate family, and this is important, because often the family is as isolated as the service-member.     




 Funny thing for me was I looked 17/18 when I was 13. Now I just look 48, LOL.  




 First, are you married? This is important to determine how you should act. 




 I had this happen to me right after I joined the military at age 28. I looked 18 or 19 and was a low ranking enlisted sailor (seaman apprentice). A chief at my first duty station asked me some asinine questions and then made some condescending comments. When she noticed the horrified look on my face she asked how old I was and after I told her she profusely apologized.  I told her, with all due respect, that she should treat all her junior sailors as adults. 




 Well shut my mouth and keep on talkin' 




 Many atheist have posed questions to this subreddit in a very civil manner as I have. The problem is some Christians will always consider it impolite for someone to ask them to physically or intellectually defend what they believe. As a Christian, you come here already in a defensive position as you should. The fact there are a lot of atheist is not surprising since it's a debate of Christianity and anyone who challenges it.

BTW; Atheist don't just reject Christianity. It's only one among many.  Don't give yourself so much credit. 




 The problem is not so much with the Chaplain Corp. The problem comes when you have a CO or XO that are so myopically religious that they either condone abuses by the base Chaplain or use their position to punish service-members according their personally held convictions. I know this first-hand.     




 Sound about how the majority of hardworking "undocumented immigrants" from Mexico are treated in the US. They must be negatively stereotyped in order to justify profiting from the poor wages paid to them.   




 Expect Moose soon. You have been warned. 




 So you're saying you don't believe in any evil spirits, demons, satan etc.? 




 I've heard this explanation of evil as an absence of good. His supposed words were that he makes peace and creates evil. 

 




 In 1982/83, the uber-cool rich kids passed around a list of people that they thought might either want something (like an abortion/suicide) or whom they thought what might have happened to them in the past. I made it to the top ten. In a school that had a graduating class of over 2,500 it floored me that they even knew who I was, especially since I was in a work-study program and left at 1200 everyday for a part-time job. My parents moved 80 miles away and I wanted to finish school there.  

So "they", the honored and privileged students of Plano Senior High School decided that I was raped/molested by my own father and felt it necessary to divulge this "fact" to every other student at the school presumably, in an effort to help me according to their own Christian hypocrisy. This was false and my father passed away on the 8th of Dec, 1985 and none of the author's was there by my side.

2013, these same smug ares's sent me an invitation to a 30 year reunion provided I spend lots of money.

Although I would have loved to go and seen how the homecoming queen and king fared, I'm secure and happy that I've proudly served in the US military, am happily married and living in a beautiful house in Fort Worth, far, far away from Plano, Texas!  

 

 




 For some reason I picture you as Percy in the movie "The Green Mile" telling Delacroix that the mouse circus doesn't exist right before he's executed.

As an atheist myself, I find this immoral and exceedingly repugnant. Frankly it is not your place or self-deluded duty to "help" them however you seem fit. Has anyone asked you for religious CPR?

I sincerely hope you don't work in any capacity with elderly or dying patients. What you are suggesting is as unethical as a well-meaning Christian telling a dying atheist they will burn in hell forever. 




 I refer to Gen 6:6,7 and Gen 8:21,22.  




 Good question! He seems to have changed his mind or at least admitted a mistake on occasion. If not, I'd say no because he's perfect, but according to Himself, He makes mistakes, so yes and no. Hope that clarifies things! 




 With the model that Christianity presents I would have to agree with you up to a point. He could have made robots out of the angels and humans but he didn't because he needed their choice to praise him and rejoice in his presence. 

Sounds like a lot of parents that want their kids to love and respect them and follow what they believe, religious and atheists alike. Doesn't always work out that way but all but the most rigid, fundamentalist parents will make their children suffer because they exercise free will. God included but He makes it forever.

God is described as omniscient, omnipotent, and omni-benevolent, a supernatural being that has existed forever and will exist forever. Sure beats my parents description. Why then does he/it require anything, especially something as mundane as worship, appreciation or sacrifice? 
 




 You're proposing that evil is not a noun but an adjective used in reference to a sin(noun) as opposed to evil being a thing itself. This indicates that evil doesn't exist in and of itself and God didn't create it despite what Isaiah says.    




 Is there no free will in heaven? Sorry, that's a question for another time. If I understand you correctly, evil is necessary for free will. Free will is necessary for salvation. So, it follows that salvation in this world is dependent upon the existence of good and evil as both are necessary for free will. "Ultimately good" was a poor choice of expression. I meant that both equally are required. Since God created both equally then does evil supply a purpose in this world? 




 Sort of. The implication is evil is necessary for good. Which follows that evil is ultimately good. 




 Nope, try ringing the bell without stomping on the floor! 




 Wish I new what the script says. Any Early English translators on reddit? 




 Obviously Leo had the money for grave diggers or freshly executed "criminals"! 




 Suicide by peat-bog. At least it's unique! Well except for that one guy that was tied up but suicide wasn't ruled out and he was preserved for over a thousand years. Talk about leaving your body to science!  




 According to Isaiah 45:7, God created everything including evil. If not directly, he, at least, created the opportunity for original sin to be committed.  




 I've never met a fox in a foxhole that had any opinion on the matter and I been serving for 18 years. 




 You obviously never served in the military but no matter. Service-members do not have to follow unlawful orders and, in fact, are required to report any incidence of violations of the UCMJ whether or not they were involved. Furthermore, if they participate in an unlawful order, they can be prosecuted under the UCMJ and civilian authorities. That's right! double jeopardy. Also, many, many decisions are made by junior personnel on their own, so far from being the drones you speak of, the military requires that they possess reasoning skills instead of the "paint it or salute it" response you believe the military wants.   




 You had me until the Muslim professor smirked quite jewishly. Is jewishly even a word? LOL 




 From what I'm seeing, did the guy get pulled over by the police? Also, does everyone in Europe have dashcams? 




 Great question! Most people think that a species is defined by its inability to interbreed. Close but not quite. Loosely, a species can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. In the case of closely related species or subspecies they can interbreed but the offspring are generally, but not always, infertile and are referred to as a F1 hybrid. Peppermint is the plant equivalent to a mule, zorses, and ligers. 

Biology is a hell of a study!   




 My grandmother's home had three people die there. Her husband from a heart attack, her son from complications of cirrhosis and her grandson, my brother, from a heroin overdose.   














 I have a Sony VAIO K series laptop that is running XP using linksys wifi router with an external linksys receiver.  My son cleaned up my hard-drives and installed Avira as virus protection but now my computer slows down and locks up on certain times. It seems to be in conjunction with Avira downloading files up to twice a day. 

Is Avira something that is causing the problem and/or are there better protections I can use. He volunteered this as a free but I don't mind paying for something better.     




 Whenever I highlight something to print as a selection on my HP Deskjet it prints it out as "run-on" linear text instead of a screenshot type format. Any suggestions please??? 














 Mine are my brother(45) and uncle(59) that haven't worked for over a decade except sporadically and are both felons. They lived with my mother until she died Dec 11 and because of her reverse mortgage have been able to con them into staying there over a year.  The property has now been sold and they're just squatting waiting for eviction.  All this while I was in the military and sending money home to help "mom".  Received 90% disability and husband and I bought our first home.  Now, in not so disguised pleas have asked to come live with us.  Hell no!!  I still feel bad for them though. What do you guys think?    














 A local church has bought up property, 50+ homes that paid property taxes (5,000 a year avg each), in an old established neighborhood, to build a mega-church which pays zero taxes, with 5,000+ members.  Parking is at a premium so they want to nudge more "neighbors" to sell their homes to build more parking thereby lowering property values even more.  I don't mind a M-C building on undeveloped land but to reformat a neighborhood and essentially force people to sell who have lived there 30+ years doesn't seem Christlike nor neighborly.  
  My suggestion would be to eliminate the tax exception for M-C's like this because they use the existing infrastructure (roads and road improvements) and all other forms of taxpayer subsidized things like police and fire protection, public schools, libraries, weather alert systems, snow and ice removal, street lighting, storm drains, and even animal nuisance for free. These M-C's bring in a lot of money.
     They act in effect like a corporation with no rules. I think they need rules. I think the time has come to take a hard look at churches that are *wink wink* "non profit" and tax them! Reddit help!!!     


































 My uncle (57) and my younger brother (46) are soon to be homeless. They're both felons and haven't held a real job for the past decade. In addition they both have heavy drug use in their past. My uncle shows signs of his meth use even though he no longer uses. My brother has stolen from me and has never even filed a tax return. They've both lived with my grandmother and/or my mom from 2000 till they both passed. She had a reverse mortgage and they've been able to stay in the house for almost a year without paying a cent except utilities, ins. and taxes which are now due.

I was in the military until 2010 and for the past ten years sent money and gifts home to help Mom.

  I bought my first home after being rated 90% disabled. My husband and I are happy except that these "freeloaders" want us to subsidize them because "they're family".

  I won't jeopardize my own family, mental health or happiness to anyone that won't help themselves and they've had a year to figure out what to to but haven't. In one month they'll be on the street at Christmas time, no less. This depresses me to know end. The only thing I'm trying to help me out of this funk is Meals on Wheels. Wish me luck!

If anyone out there has had similar experience please share. I can't imagine it's not uncommon.
 





























 Really?, I guess the morals of the whole Bible were cherry-picked to death by the founders of the US or at least the Republican party? 

You make the declaration that your Christian god has given us absolute moral laws to abide by given your view. You say that this is a nation of freedom of religion as long as all other religions acknowledge that your religion is dominate and others must just suck it up.  

As far as I can read, the bible and it's new and old parts are as immoral as any book comes.  If you want to ban an obscene book from the public or school libraries it would be this book although I would never do that because I don't believe in banning books.  

I'd like to remind you that other religions say their morals are as right as yours.  You've decided to put your faith in a Christian god.  Good luck with that! 




 Have you ever considered that the image that God created mankind is not a physical mirror image but a potential mirror image of His intent and His compassion reflected in your soul/spirit?   




 Maybe "God' intentionally made the possibility of what "we" would call an aberration of nature for a purpose. Maybe he had a purpose for these people? 

I'm not one to delve into knowing the mind of such a God but it seems to me that if there is a god, all his creations were meant for some purpose even if they don't fit into our limited and contrived boxes and as such maybe, just maybe, this god is testing your compassion and what this god gave people as far as intellect.  

I kinda remember a sermon were Jesus said something along the lines of "as you treat the least fortunate then my father shall treat you".

Jog my memory please!   




 You define these Christians as hypocritical.  I do not.  A thorough reading of the Bible states that true believers are compelled to spread the gospel of Christ and make unbelievers understand the consequences of the choice they are given.  If they then choose to not follow the rules and commandments of Christianity then they shall burn in hell if the Christians don't do it first.  They've just replaced the actual burning with yelling taunts and insults. Everyone likes 
some encouragement!

The tired argument that Fundamental Christians are tolerant is laughable.  They are as intolerant as the most Fundamentalist Muslim radicals. 

A true follower of Christianity understands this and I respect their devout faith. It certainly rings truer than the milk-toasty pick and choose bible verses that fits whatever society you're in now deems moral for the majority of Christians of late. Talk about hypocritical! 

I'm saying that the true Christians aren't hypocritical or self-apologizing for their persecution of non-Christians. They truly believe that conversion is a matter of everlasting life.  Where I would rein them in is when it comes to mine or my children's rights to a neutral place to work or go to school. 




 Okay, I'm getting the picture now.  I've had to pay the property tax on my mothers house too.  I wouldn't include that in my own tax bill though.  You and your sister and mother have moved back on to help offset his tax burden and their housing situation.  That is your (PA=you'ins) choice but you didn't have to.  So don't include this in you recap of taxes you have to pay.  The $1600+ would be the same as if you were buying food, repairs to the home, insurance or paid for a replacement AC.  

What I'm saying is you misrepresented yourself in your original argument with ACA concerning your tax liabilities.   




 
"If in your world "Christians" are bullying non Christian people, then they aren't Christians at all."

In the real world, real Christians from many denominations have not only bullied but persecuted and many times murdered non-Christians or Christians from other sects all over the world.  Your No True Scotsman argument is quite false.

As far as your question about my own experience I would like to point out that I never said I was persecuted.  I said members of my family were bullied in school by Christians.  One example I can give you among many was the bullying my niece received at her school from her classmates when she "revealed" that her grandparents were Buddhist.  One would have thought by the reactions she received that she had said her grandparents were Satanist that practiced ritual baby killings.  The mean comments and ostracizing she got from the other kids were vicious and unrelenting even though she, herself was Christan  She would come home and cry uncontrollably because she couldn't defend herself or her grandparents at her age and none of her teachers ever tried stop the bullying.  This is the reason that these clubs, even in elementary schools are needed.  

It's not an agenda supposedly pushing atheism or even homosexuality.  It's about giving children of different backgrounds, different faiths or lack of, and sexual orientation a safe place to express themselves, vent, and connect with others of like mind.  The sad thing is many schools willfully oppose and actively try to prevent these non-traditional clubs from forming.  
 




 I'm going to assume that the 30.57% for property tax is based on the % of the total taxes you pay which you state is $16,000.  That would mean your property tax is around $4800.  

I pay about $1800 a year in property tax on a house appraised at $100,000. Assuming rates in PA are the same, you are living in a home valued at around $250,000 on a income of $25,000?  

I can see where you might appreciate the help of your relatives.  With such a limited income you couldn't afford a mortgage, insurance, and taxes.  Did you inherit this property?   




 Your total tax rate is 64% (or higher because standard deductions weren't included) in your earnings bracket? Where the heck do you live that state or city taxes are that high? 




 How are they using bulling as a weapon?  A weapon against what? The fact that Christians in the the USA have dominated and bullied other members of other religions for centuries and are now crying discrimination because they can't bully and discriminate? You should apologize! The only agenda I see from atheists is full inclusion into society and the protection of their children from hateful comments like, "you and your whole family is going to burn in Hell" from a 8 year old classmate.  

Whether or not you are aware of Christian religious bulling in schools it in fact happens and my family has has been in its cross-hairs.  If you think that atheist are only the bully maybe you're confused with the rights that adult atheists have tried to stand up for but, as far as the school yard persecution, that is alive and well and these clubs may help to keep these groups (non-christians and atheists) safe and maybe even excepted despite the bigotry and myopic views that are handed down to the unfortunate children of ignorant parents.  




 In a convenience store in New Orleans in front of the clerk an old black man asked me if I wanted to be a virgin again and said he could do it.  I was a 34 yr old white woman holding my 4 yr old son's hand.    




 Are you writing a dissertation or something? To your questions, he doesn't subscribe to any hard religions and is keeping his mind open but doesn't identify with Satanism anymore.  I think your comment was valid.  The point I was trying to make is that non-religious parents sometimes make the same mistakes as religious ones....in that your children aren't really your own. That you may wish for a  cookie-cutter imprint on them, don't expect it because they are separate human beings with a mind of their own.  




 Funny but I did research Satanism at the time and came up with more or less the same conclusion although I refrained from quizzes. 

He's 18 now and has a completely different perspective.  He does play the bass and after a brief love affair with Pantera has embraced Jazz and Blues.  His IQ is around 160 and will be entering the Navy's nuke program soon unless I can talk him out of being a MU!

To all the freethinker parents out there beware and yes, it's a good idea to teach your child basic religious instruction. 




 I'm shaking my head in disbelief that you've equated physical strength to intellectual and emotional strength. Women are for the most part, physically weaker then men. So what. The largest mammal on the earth is a female. Do you really equate that to some elementary school yard argument that men are, as a gender, smarter then women and thus supports the bibles' arguments of gender inequality when it comes to matters of social involvement in religion and politics? 




 Being an atheist I thought very hard about my influence on my child.  I wanted him to be a freethinker and hoped he would come close to the same conclusions I've come to so I tried to teach him critical thinking skills assuming he would reach the "right" conclusion.  Was I ever thrown for a loop when he announced he was a Satanist on his Facebook page when he was 15!  




 Well if we are to dive into the reasons gay marriage should be illegal under the Christian Flag then we should also consider the circumstances that would allow marriages to be legal under the same flag.  

First, polygamy.  Many of the Old Testament Prophets and Patriarchs had multiple wives, including Lamech, Abraham, Jacob, Esau, Gideon, Saul, David, Solomon, Rehoboam, Elkanah, Ashur, Abijah and Jehoiada. Some interpretations also suggest Moses had a second wife in Tharbis. Other polygamists identified in the Bible include Ahab, Ahasuerus, Ashur, Belshazzar, Benhadad, Caleb, Eliphaz, Ezra, Jehoiachin, Jehoram, Jerahmeel, Joash, Machir, Manasseh, Mered, Nahor, Simeon, and Zedekiah.

Second, the age of the bride was usually customary to be 12 years or even younger. 

Third, that rape victims were required to marry their rapist since their value as property was diminished. Deuteronomy 22:28-29.

Forth, slaves or prisoners of war were forced in marriage. Numbers 31:7-18 and Judges 21: 10-24.

Want to base US laws on what your myopic view of Christianity deems fitting as marriage then go right ahead and see how your Christian flag gets saluted!  




 Indulge me to allow the rephrasing of your statement:

 "The argument is that men and women differ and are not the same. You guys like to foment the idea that that is not true - that men and women are the same, have same capabilities, same responses, same reactions, and you are simply incorrect."

The argument is that blacks and whites differ and are not the same. You guys like to (sic)foment the idea that that is not true - that blacks and whites are the same, have same capabilities, same responses, same reactions, and you are simply incorrect.

Sounds a lot like an argument for the Jim Crow, separate but equal laws doesn't it?
 
Racism and sexism are both based on fear and the idea of superiority, dominance and submission.  The fact is the bible, from the beginning to the end, stresses the superiority of men over women. Whether one can prove Paul promoted this or not is irrelevant since the rest of the "good book" is quite clear.  




 You made the statement that men and women differ in some sort of mental capacity that affects their abilities to respond or react which somehow prevents a woman from being equal to a man. I asked you for examples and instead you asked me for examples from my experience in the military which I will provide after you defend your original statement.     




 rape seed oil = canola oil.  




 I'd like you to show some examples where women and men have different capabilities, responses or reactions that aren't culturally ingrained.  

As a former military member I've seen the gamut and find that men are no more different in their intellectual makeup then women especially under stress.    




 B. This one always got me.  Eve was deceived by a smooth talking serpent that claimed to know the mind of God and what would happen to them.  Since Eve didn't know right from wrong how could she make an ethical decision based on her experience. (If you've ever had young children you will know that telling them not to do something doesn't mean they understand that it's wrong or evil). Adam is influenced by Eve, who is, for all intent and purposes is a lessor creature and as naive as he is but he succumbs to, not a sly talking serpent, but a mere woman. Does he get the brunt of God's wrath for being gullible? No! Eve does! She has to bear children in pain for her "crime" alone. They both have to leave Eden but Adam had no specific punishment for his "crime".

Sorry, but just typing this out makes the story even more ridiculous!  




 From my experience and that of my mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, great great grandmother etc., we all agree that all men and women came from a women body following the conception required from both sexes.  

The fact that the bible considers women an afterthought and not made in the same image or glory of god is the reason that half of the human population has been treated like sub-humans without the basic freedoms of thought, speech, movement or self-determination that the average man enjoys.  Paul clearly defines a woman's role as existing for the benefit of men. To me, it's not much different then Playboy's exploitation of women.   




 As to your original question.....YES! 




 My ex was a framer/carpenter and grew a beard every winter.  I went through this same thing every spring when he shaved it off although it was kinda like makin' out with a different guy for awhile! 




 First person to mention emotional pain. That kind of pain can last a long time and no medicine can really help.  I'd give you gold if I had it.  Sorry for your loss. 




 Diverticulitis!  Occurs when small indigestible things like seeds, corn or bits of nuts get stuck in small pockets that have formed in the lower intestine and then become infected.  When the first bout occurred they gave me 1.0 gram of dilaudid which is 8x stronger than morphine and that wasn't even close enough to allow me to stand up straight!  The worst part is that I'm a chef and can no longer eat anything that has those ingredients.   




 I think Annie Oakley said it best when she said men, that were a sure shot, were considered marksmen but when she did it, it was trick-shooting.  

In this day and age, the favorite double standard between male and female managers is that men have an opinion on how to get things done and women have an opinionated view that is female centered. Complete BS!  




 Good for you bitch! 




 As the overweight middle-aged woman that uses the scooters in the grocery store and gets the occasional funny looks from some people I don't even know, I say screw them.  This is what they don't know.  I'm a military veteran that is 90% disabled. I can walk short distances but prolonged standing or walking is excruciating. The steroids I'm given have significantly contributed to my size along with depression and PTSD. I resisted using a cart at shopping outings but my husband loves to shop and browse so I gave in.   

So to all the redditors out there that say I'm not a person, I'm gross, don't have any self-discipline, selfish because I took a cart from an old person, or whatever other vitriolic spew comes forth, I'll tell you to look in the mirror. How many of you have served your country and suffered from it?  To those that have served you know, but the majority of comments are from those that have no clue and to those I say you're welcome. Every time I get those looks or comments here I hold my head up high and wish everyone a peaceful good day! 

  




 The problem is that you're being intellectually dishonest with yourself and you aren't living in the reality that those "words" can motivate people to justify their position that they are entitled to withhold a persons right to full representation in government and in the free market. 

Here in Texas, I'm not allowed to hold a public office even though I'm a highly decorated and disabled veteran of the military.  Why?  Because I'm an atheist and I refuse to say that an ice cream cone on a hot summers day is my definition of a god.    




 The church I grew up and was confirmed in refused to let me get married there because I hadn't attended in 8 years. I was a minor and my mother moved to another side of our city. He was British so this didn't surprise me although I was disappointed with the congregation's reaction. 




 Heh, my mom was talking about this and I can't help but chime in on the subject (I am her son).  Honestly, I really have no opinion on the subject, as I have never had a partner say "Eeew, I don't like you being cut, so we just aren't going to have sex." or vice versa.  I am not any happier or in any way saddened by being cut.  Hey, at the very bottom line, I'm a little grateful for being able to be lazy with hygiene (although I'm not) and get away with it.  Also: As I know no different, I can't say for sure that I'm as sexually "effective" as I would otherwise be, but I'm not impotent, and that's the (relatively, because I don't plan on having any kids any time soon) important part.

Oh, and I know a few people that are Jewish, and it's more about honoring Abraham than appeasing any kind of god. 




 Your putting up a paper tiger.  

Explain to me why I, as a disabled military veteran with an approved dog can be refused service from a taxi driver because his religious beliefs think that dogs are unclean or my religious beliefs won't let you carry a bottle of wine in my luggage.  What if, as a taxi business, I wouldn't pick you up and drop you off at your home because my religious beliefs dictated that as a woman you have no rights?   




 Are you a parent?  




 I covered the ability to provide part.  My analysis is not "silly". If you're too lazy to research the topic then try this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGx4IlppSgU Although not comprehensive into full series of the Mask of Men it's a starting point!  




 I'm not ashamed but I do regret my part in the decision. His father had a say in the matter too.  However, your anger at me is misdirected.  Our society puts a lot of pressure to conform and while my decision was partially based on this I do not think he is deformed or had his sexuality affected in any way.
  
With that being said, I'm sure your own mother and father would like to circumcise whatever organ that causes the vitriolic bile that spews from your mouth and replace it with a civilized prosthetic.        




 No. There were studies then that indicated circumcision reduced the rate of cancer and other diseases but they were later  dismissed because the subjects studied were in third-world countries were sanitation/hygiene weren't considered a priority.      




 Hoping it's not a nail! 




 As an Atheist/Buddhist I had my son circumcised because of health reasons and concerns from his father as far as being different.  I've asked him as an adult and he has no problem with it.  As as women and have experienced both I'd say I prefer a circumcised penis. Sorry Foreskin!  




 Only the balls man, only the balls! Dicks don't cause pregnancy, nads do.  Keep the penis! 




 I think you hit the nail on the head!  




 Unlike girls, that naturally "become" women based on their first menses, some cultures feel the need to provide a time in which boys "become" men based also on their ability to procreate since there is no specific event for males.  Menstruation and childbirth=pain and blood so, in some cultures, not surprisingly, they require boys to demonstrate their ability to withstand pain and/or survive an injury involving blood, although this can also coincide with an ability to provide for his family.  The example above does both and also puts the burden of birth control on the male!  




 Again my friend, what are you referring to? 

You have the right to refuse service to anyone as long as it's not based on sex, religion, national origin, race or sexual orientation.  These categories are based on federal laws.  Do you feel you have the religious right to circumvent federal laws.....yes or no? 

 




 Not my first memory but when I was six I remember the phone rang one evening and my Mom answered. She then threw the receiver at my Dad saying it was his girlfriend. Two months later he was gone and my mother started working. We were babysat at home and on July 5 I fell and broke my arm looking for fireworks my gran had given us. I spent 2 days in the hospital then went to live with my cousins and never went back home. Fast-forward to 2009 and my gran died on July 4th.  You'd think Independence Day would be a sad time for me but it hasn't. 

I hope Christmas wasn't totally ruined for you. 




 "gay couple discriminating based on religion".....what are you talking about? 




 Did you type these estimates/statistics with a straight face? LOL 




 Reminds me of "The Incredible Mr Limpet"! 




 If you have a public business then yes, you have to give a valid reason to refuse service. 

It's not based on a sense of entitlement but a history of discrimination that did not allow blacks to use the same front door or stay at the same hotel where they entertaining whites ect.

If you are going to discriminate based on race, religion, sex, or disability then you have to state this and prove why. 




 Sorry Sid, at first I thought you meant that all gays were good at flower arrangements and decorating cakes. You still however, haven't answered the soundness of your proposed business plan.  




 Considering that HC covered 282 laws it would definably be impressive!

The problem with the Big 10 is that six of the "laws" directly conflict with the US Constitution. The remaining four are almost universal and do not need to be tied to a specific religion.    




 The largest Christian charity is Christian but not Catholic.

Real justice under your oldest, continuously operating institution in the world that condoned murder upon innocents and "heretics" in the past for over 400 years and in real time, (it's denial of their support the Catholic Church gave Hitler.) leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Don't believe me LIU. 




 Well said. 




 Does a person starting a business that only targets 10% of the population across all socio-economic status that may or may not get married much less use a florist or baker sound like they have a good business plan? 

BTW, your narrow-minded stereotype of gays is almost laughable if it weren't out-dated.     




 It can if it will get all those Christians to stop insisting on the "big ten" being posted everywhere based on the US being a Christian Nation! 




 I should clarify that I'm looking for the reasons or arguments to justify any discrimination based on religious beliefs and how far should you be allowed to go and not solutions.  If you believe religious discrimination is okay then is it okay for you to be discriminated against based on another religion. The case of Muslim taxi drivers that won't allow service dogs or bottles of alcohol in in their cabs comes to mind.  




 "What church do you go to" 




 You don't have to blow up. Calmly tell them that you disagree and that while you understand and appreciate their concerns you must follow your own conscience. Maybe you can add that sometime in the future you may change your mind just to give them hope and shut them up. 

I understand how it hurts to think that family could think this way but you need to understand that they don't wish this upon you. They really believe this to be your fate and only want the best for you however misguided. Life is short. Live your life as true to yourself as you possibly can no matter is it upsets ANYONE. Live in reality always and never live a lie! 




 You, your parents and brother are all behaving hypocritically. Is your sister the source of tension? Why can't you all hold your own opinions?

 




 If you are an atheist or agnostic and have read the AA material that treats "patients" like some primitive sub-humans that will someday see the light then well, its no wonder its supposed miracle cure doesn't work. Just a little snake oil and a lot of jobs in the rehab business are on the hook if this lie is ever found out.
   




 I could be wrong now, but I don't think so!

At an AA meeting you are depending on others that are emotionally stunted due to their substance dependence to help you through your own problems. Sounds like a bad plan to me. 




 The expectation though is that you will eventually "mature" or grow to understand that your limited view of a higher power actually is the Christian god.  I guess that if believing a doorknob is your higher power and it helps to stop you from self destruction then go for it. 

For me and others like me, this is intellectually dishonest so the program could never provide any help. I never had any legal problems involving alcohol. I just knew I was drinking too much and needed help so I self referred to the Navy's rehab program.  What I didn't do was check my constitutional right to freedom of religion at the door in order to get medical care.    




 I find your attitude about 12-step programs refreshing.  So many of those that have been helped by AA/NA, which are few compared to the number of people that have tried it, become almost cultish about 12-steps being the only program that works.

I'm an atheistic Buddhist so AA's principles were in conflict with the Buddhist principle that the power to change comes from within yourself and, of course the fact that I hold no belief in Gods.

There are several organizations that you can recommend. I used Rational Recovery but there is also S.O.S., Secular Organization for Sobriety and Women for Sobriety.  

WFS is particularly helpful because the challenges female alcoholics face are usually different then mens and some AA/NA groups can be predatory toward women that are in a vulnerable state i.e., the 13th step.  

Again thanks for having the insight to realize AA is not a one fits all fix.
Best wishes to you!
 




 "I don't think the literature, or the opinion of many recovering addicts, agrees with your notion that AA "is clearly a religious program" and requires a belief in God."

Several federal court opinions have found that compulsory participation in AA/NA is unconstitutional because of its religious nature.  Have you read the condescending chapter in the Big Book addressed to the Agnostic? It clearly says that a higher power is a reference to God.
 




 The moral of the story is don't let anyone define you including yourself. 




 I agree that actually making love with a woman is preferable to watching and jacking off to a porn video. I like to watch porn and sometimes with my SO *BUT*......
The problem is most porn makes a caricature of what actual sex is like so that people, especially if they are young with no experience, think that this is the norm when it's not.  Young women don't feel they measure up to the women they see  in the videos. Young men often feel inadequate compared to the videos. When this is their bench mark, and you have to include the performances of their favorite entertainers, they have no REAL REFERENCE POINT to gauge their real  sexuality and how to express it.  This has led to to so much sexual dysfunction among Americans that is could be be referred to as an epidemic.

Pat's worse than a moron. He's a charlatan that has bilked millions to pay for his extreme wealthy lifestyle. He's smart and savvy. A moron doesn't know better but Pat is the poster child of why religious entities such as church's like his needs to be audited by the IRS.

He is nothing more than a snake-oil salesmen and HE KNOW THIS! Just can't wait for his except status is pulled.     




 You didn't listen to Pat, the pictures are the problem because we can never measure up. Maxim did teach me how to hypnotize a live lobster though the purpose of this knowledge was just to impress/seduce a woman.   




 Okay, I agree but only if you include men that read Maxim. It too offers the same idiotic advise to men as Cosmo gives to women only spelled different. 




 You obviously should be so proud of your Dad. 




 Urine is sterile by the way.  




 Can you explain? I thought any number multiplied by 0=0.  




 Pissing on yourself or your "friend" will stop the pain from some plants and insects such as bull nettles, mosquitoes, ant bites and some jellyfish stings. Ammonia works well too if ya don't have it in ya.  




 Nice try! 




 And was appealed and overturned. 




 Most menstruating women that have cramps don't go to sickcall unless it's severe or are bleeding heavily or for too long. Believe it or not, women know that Pamperin and Motrin can help and use those.  Most though, just get through it and get on with life. 

What exceptional story are you referring to? 




 What a beautiful calli! We have one that's a stray. She drinks from our Koi pond and catches the mice so we feed her dry food. She got flack from our two cats but doesn't anymore.  Try this; make sure Sasha is there before you feed her. Give Sasha a Tablespoon of what you're feeding the stray (even if it's the same thing you feed your cat everyday, Sasha will go for it for territorial reasons).  It's a distraction and it reinforces a positive element to the visits from the stray.  Worked for us, they now touch noses through the glass door to our sunroom.

As far as the hole......bad idea!  You're inviting squirrels, coons, skunks and possums to make their home there. 

Good luck and best wishes! 




 What happened? 




 Blame it on their period? JK I know guys get it too. 




 Chef here, most of us keep super glue in our knife bag for this exact purpose. Also, black pepper is great to stop bleeding on a small cut. 




 This may surprise you but no.  Some of the best sex talkers out there are guys! 




 I'm sorry for this but I just imagined Lil Jon saying "What!, what?. 

Any deaf people out the that want to enjoy phone sex? Maybe I'll make a million printing the "white" pages. 




 Keep trying.  Do you have assists other than the VA? You might try the DVR in your state 




 The military medical corps is advised to try to distinguish between real medical situations vs. those that are suspect. The end result is everyone is considered suspect until otherwise proven because of ppl trying to get out of duty, which, if you are in a medical emergency can be fatal in the wrong command and can't get proper medical evaluation.  




 Hope your Dad is Okay but still, NOT COOL! 




 I've heard if you crush up the tablets and heat them with ammonia it makes a very good mesquito remedy. 




 Sounds like my uncle.  He has prostrate problems that he take meds for fluid retention. He was hospitalized for it and has high blood pressure but he'll drink a 2 liter coke a day and even salts his pizza and smokes. He's homeless and I let him stay here briefly with me and my husband during which he pissed on our guest bed. I made him wear diapers the rest of the time but he became insulted and left. If he doesn't care, why should I? 




 Exactly  




 military? 




 You're so right. I've heard many stories of the Navy blowing off back pain, men and women but women have to go through the ol' is it your period or pregnant part first even if we're post menopausal and it's in our record lol. 
VA care isn't much better. 




 If you cut off a small piece called an "eye" that then can sprout it's possible but doubtful.  




 Really dude, What kind of outward sign do you need to have your arbitrary pain taken seriously?   After being given Motrin and sent back to the field when I couldn't stand up-right I ended up at the local civilian hospital and after they took the time to look for a cause, found I was suffering from diverticulitis (not rare) and given morphine for pain.

I hope you're not anywhere in the medical field especially the military. 




 Yeh well maybe she forgot or didn't know that a potato cause those symptoms.  




 Maybe. It's not legally considered part of the sex industry though child labor laws might come into play. I guess you wouldn't be able to call your service as Googoo, ooo, oooo, ooooo, Gaga, aa, aaa , aaaaa!   




 My family member hasn't faced murder charges but he told me he killed his best friends' wife because she took/sold all his pain medication until he died of cancer. I have no evidence he did this and someone else was with him. I only have his word.     




 Phone sex operator. It's legal, you can be any age or in any shape/disability and work your own hours. Put an ad in the paper. Great tax write-offs too! 




 "woman came in complaining of severe stomach pain. He was expecting to diagnose her with menstrual cramps or something else rudimentary and gave her basic pain meds etc"

This pisses me off. As a female with a 20 yr career in the Navy I can't count how many times some male corpsman blew off my symptoms this way.  If this story was true, which I doubt because a vine growing from a potato would not be able to grow outside the uterus/vagina and make its way to the spine, and she was in severe abdominal pain and the only thing he did was give her Motrin then send her on her way he would have been brought up on charges if it was found she was suffering from a real medical emergency condition. 

That said, I think your buddy was just drunkenly jerking your leg. Thanks for letting me vent though!  




 Barry, can you back any of your statements with facts?

Or are you just being ignorant and ranting because you're well, ignorant. 




 No, this is soo right! 




 Sorry bicyclists, but you get what you deserve. Saw this all the time in San Diego. Bike clubs would ride in formation and since there were so many of them they would block stop signs and force the whole group to go through, blocking regular traffic and pedestrian traffic. I guess the spandex and the fact that they are "what?" means they are above the rules.  




 Why do you think I should have reverence for a book that has negatively influenced the treatment of half of the human population simply because of the sex that they were born into. The bible, and specifically the Genesis story has condemned women into second-class status slightly higher than a child. Woman are held responsible for the downfall of all mankind and because of your "good" book women have paid tremendous injustices over the centuries for just being born female.  

 The story of A   E is a myth that has been used to subjugate women  by blame and slander. As for the morality of 1,000 years ago when slavery and entire nations drew their moral code from the bible, I just wonder what kind of planet you think live on ???  




 Let their dog shit all over the complex but especially the area around the mail boxes and not pick it up so we have to smell it when picking up our mail.  




 You're not too well acquainted with the correctional/justice system. As a law student you should be. Jails don't correct anyone. If anything they create criminals.  

My question was how is the law practically applied? Does society only arrest those that say, threaten to jump off a bridge and in doing so tie up traffic? 




 Haven't heard this in years but it's appropriate, http://youtu.be/3Vl9Uz-rmIU 




 Pre-law student,  I was not arrested after my suicide attempt and, as far as I know, you can't charge someone who's dead with self murder, how is this law (if there is one) applied? 




 If you were a burned out ex-meth user, felon, and alcoholic homeless guy with permanent brain damage that has left you with mental health problems along with physical problems brought about by poor lifestyle choices, ie, diet, smoking, no exercise etc. which together makes you unable to hold down any kind of job and you have no friends or family that would be hurt if you died and you also decided to commit suicide in a manner that wouldn't affect any strangers, would it still be considered selfish? 




 So what? I don't care if Christianity, Judaism. or Islam has solid evidence of interpretation. Which they don't. What does solid evidence of interpretation mean?  
  If you mean that a religious myth has had a solid tradition of being handed down through generations of interpretations then..Big Deal! Ignorant parents raising ignorant kids. What is your point?
  The constitution of the US is infinitively greater than your holy book.
   




 Makes me wonder how they did that. As a parent you would think that it would be impossible not to develop emotional attachments. Did they just turn it on after the first birthday? 




 Pepper, never ever concede that which you have no proof of. Ever.

You are correct that Perry and his cronies' only objective is to change the foundation of our state government to be based on Christian Biblical rules and laws including the education of our children. I base this on his ties to the Dominionist's organizations he has supported and their specific legislation. I also agree that educator's within my state abuse and flaunt established laws and the state doesn't come down hard enough when violations are discovered. 
There are, however, a few diligent rational folks in Texas that have managed, to some degree, to keep them in check.

If you know of a school district that has allowed creationism to be taught as fact you need to let me know where or at least contact the TBE. 

BTW: Regarding concessions, I'm not a teacher but thanks anyway.  I'm only a disabled Navy(cook) Veteran that has had an interest in Paleontology for the last 30 years.  




 That's the mafia's take on it anyway. 




 Yes I do.

"In July 2011, the Texas Board of Education, which oversees the Texas Education Agency, did not approve anti-evolution instructional materials submitted by International Databases, LLC, while continuing to approve materials from mainstream publishers."

It might be helpful if you thoroughly read the entire contents of the links you provide.  That said, critical analysis of darwinian evolution could include the small debate between punctuated equilibrium vs uniform phyletic gradualism. The TEA does not require the teaching of creationism. Critical analysis is good to teach public school students. It also helps when reading articles on the internet.  




 Teaching creationism is not required in Texas. JS 




 Thank God it's working! 




 From the Bible, we find passages that won't even acknowledge a child until they are a month old. Maybe because of the death rate but at least one would simply acknowledge that they existed but they didn't.  
























 Anything that is inedible, is not really meant to be eaten or has no relation to the ingredients on the plate and which can be flicked off the plate with your thumb and finger.  Examples would be a tomato rose, a flower or a sprig of herb that is not used in the dish.
 




 .......and they probably speak English better than some here.  Hopefully they don't learn English from some of our videos that promote slang.  




 WUT?!!!   




 I've heard that there are more people in China that can speak and write English then in America. BTW, my mom couldn't understand Chinese but she recognized their language. 




 lol 




 This was my mom's experience not mine.  I'm sure she knew how to use it but knowing her quirks she was just interested in why the instructions were so long.  Maybe there was some ancient Chinese wisdom that said one should Never Ever use Tiger Balm on specific sore places! 




 Mom told it better than I can.  She had a great sense of humor.  




 I got the impression they knew exactly what they were doing and probably had a great laugh over it later!  




 How do you figure that?  As far as I know he never married, hung out with 12 other guys whom he encouraged to leave their families just for him and I don't recall him saying anything about gays explicitly.   




 My uncle is this sloth's long lost twin brother! 




 Thanks!  I'm assuming I should work bottom to top and use odd numbers. 




 Awesome!  I'm in culinary school and my instructors wont allow us to use garnishes that are "flickable" for plating such as a tomato rose however, I'm now planning to use the strawberry rose as anyone would eat that!  Any tips? 




 My mother and cousin were in CA on vacation.  Mom's back was sore/stiff from driving so she bought some Tiger Balm however, all the instructions were in Chinese which she didn't understand.  She spots this elderly Chinese couple and approaches them to ask if they could read to her what the instructions said.  The elderly woman takes the instructions, looks it over and smilingly broadly says yes.  She then starts to slowly explain in Chinese what the instruction says looking up occasionally to make sure they are listening or sometimes pointing out something on the instructions and nodding her head to make sure they understood. She and her husband did this with a serious, straight face the whole time. She hands the instructions back to my Mom.  My mother politely thanks her the she and her husband walk away without saying a word.       




 From someone really old (meaning before cellphones, digital cameras, the Internet and accompanying social media) we had to physically meetup with our friends.  That meant actually leaving our house!  Of course it also meant, for some activities you had to travel a significant distance. 

That leads me to the first thing to be cool.  A driver's license.  After that if you were really cool you may have had your own car!  Of course you couldn't show off said car without Facebook so you had to do the the next best thing which was the second coolest thing.

Cruising the lake, beach or local drag on Friday or Saturday was the standard.  Drive-ins were also acceptable but you couldn't blare your favorite cassette featuring AC/DC, Duran Duran, or Cars to name but a few. 

Cheap alcohol, pot and maybe microdot were acceptable but anything harder then that, then you were considered a freak or druggie to be avoided.  

I have to add this, getting knocked up or getting a girl pregnant was not seen as cool or some sort of achievement.    




 Your dad has some mad talent.  As someone who is familiar with koi, the markings aren't so great.  Pretty but not what koi dealers look for.  If he studied up the subject he may appeal to more koi enthusiasts. As for me, I'd love to buy a painting! 




 Now if only the average US female marine could do that! 




 and we pay no state income taxes with only a modest sales tax of 7.25%. 




 Winnsboro, Tx, just a tiny spot in the piney woods of east Texas 




 No 




 $235,000 or so 




 When I was a server, it was assumed I made 15% from the $'s that I sold and my earnings were reported as income to the IRS whether I received 15% or not.  What I didn't know then is that, as a hourly paid employee who is paid less than minimum wage as most of us are, if our tips don't combine to equal minimum wage then the employer must make up the difference.  

So lets say you're on the clock as a server and no one comes into the restaurant the entire time you've been hired to provide wait-staffing duties.  You are paid $2.86 per hour to be there and you stay there the entire time but never encounter a customer.  The restaurant has to pay minimum wage, $5.75 in some states to make up for their lack of customers while you're on the clock.  This is a little known secret that most places don't want servers to know about. 




 If it were some of the people I worked with, they would have ripped open the front of the Shiner case and taken out bottles from the middle hoping the ones on the outside plus the cardboard would be sufficient to hold up the rest the cases. 




 Worked in a plant nursery where people would bring in leaves and ask why they were turning brown.  "It's fall" 




 My brother gave me this album for X-Mass.  Always enjoyed it and have never came across anyone who knew who they were. Thanks. 




 Todd Rundgren,  "Hello it's me" was for the masses but the album, "A wizard, A Star" decidedly was not and I love it to this day! 




 This is why everyone should know how to tell how long ago a tire was manufactured.  Rubber degenerates. Many "new" tires sold are up to two years old if not older in some unscrupulous stores.   




 Tootie, I'm sure that your grandma can tell you about her discovery 




 and clitoral ripples! 




 As someone that worked at a high end hotel in a major metropolis in the US I can verify that Saudi guests are the most demanding (wanting lamb at 2 am) and the most obnoxious and sexist A-holes I've ever dealt with.  I guess they suffer from Affluenza too! 




 I've always thought that Jimmy Carter, while handed a s**t sandwich, handled the Iran situation well.  He had the stones to refuse to negotiate with terrorists unlike Reagan who traded arms for hostages.  He may not be the most celebrated president but he is undoubtedly the most post-executive selfless serving president of all.    




 I'm confused, I thought the holy trinity was onions, bell peppers, and celery. 




 No 




 I think you're confusing celebration with endorsement neither of which apply to US discrimination laws concerning business practices.  

If I provide a cake for a 10 year olds' birthday I'm neither celebrating nor endorsing the birthday.  I may sincerely believe that his age should include the 9 months of gestation before birth as some cultures do but that's not my place.  I sell cakes and because I choose to sell them to the public in the US I have to adhere to non-discriminationary laws.

Your examples of the photographer fail.  Unless you have the photographer give a thumbs-up in a photo or force a personal statement of endorsement of the marriage you don't have a claim of a  violation of your personal beliefs. Just photographing the event is not an endorsement.

As far as your silly comment about atheist, we absolutely don't borrow Christian morality as our world view.  We reject Christian morality with all its hypocrisy. To most atheist, Christian morality is an oxymoron. 

 The arrogant attitude that Christians hold themselves to concerning their monopoly on morality is laughable at best. 




 I'm not talking about individuals.  Many individuals from many religions are critical thinkers in their respective fields.  

I'm referring to a religions capacity from their own tenets to be able to allow or even encourage critical analysis of itself.  The only religion that comes to mind that even comes close to is certain sects of Buddhism. All the other major religions from history and my experience would be perfectly happy to not have their followers be exposed to other religions or people with no religion.  More than just a few bad apples.  Do you remember reading about the Inquisition?  Are you aware of the religious freedoms denied in other countries?   




 I'd probably guess the later however good luck to you both! 




 You need the disclaimer, "Don't try this at home" or you'll have guys showing up at the hospital with super glue shoved into their dicks.  




 YET! 




 My son's astrolabe. 




 Although they both seek answers to basic questions concerning life they are inherently different. Philosophy is always based on critical thinking and wisdom.  Religions are not and most are actively apposed to critical analysis. 




 I meant he was resurrected or raised from the state of death.  So therefore, while he may have physically died for a brief time he was brought back to life.   




 I'm not sure about the hell and back thing.  Where does it say that he went to hell after he "died"?  Either way, since he was resurrected and then ascended into heaven what, if anything was sacrificed and if so, by whom? 




 The problem I have with this is Jesus ultimately did not die so there was no sacrifice.   




 Most likely almond tuiles. 




 I  imagine that after the pearl broke the bottom part of the shell would hold the sauce for dipping. 




 The "pearl" is probably a chocolate sauce but it can be made with many types of liquid.  The technique is called spherification using molecular gastronomy.  Basically sodium alginate is mixed with the liquid, then dropped into a calcium chloride bath by the spoon full.  This causes a "membrane" to form which holds the chocolate in a sphere shape.
Cool huh?  




 It's not crazy at all and almost all European Christians understand this but unfortunately many American Christian theologians want the Bible to explain the history and origin of life and they will stop short of nothing to to advance their views regardless of all scientific evidence that shows the Bible is wrong on this subject

 




 Kangaroos were in the middle east?  Is there evidence of that? 




 Why are you Christian?, birth or choice? 




 Are you kidding me?  Seriously? 




 For the most part no.  




 Paul's teaching did not come first.  Jesus's teachings did and overrode many things anything Paul proposed later.  The break came because of the lineage of Jesus's bloodline vs the apostles and their authority over the early Christians.  It was basically a power-struggle.  No big whoop here but A big whoop then! 




 The common disputes are over land, wealth, and political control.  The use of religion as an excuse to justify horrific methods to obtain these ends is both ancient and contemporary and is always used to appeal to common people.  Rarely has a religion grown and thrived without the support of government.  This is why some American Christians are threated and lashing out against perceived prosecutions against them.  

Their dominance is quickly eroding and they know that the US Constitution does not support their former favored status.  Neither do our laws or legal agencies concerning discrimination.

  Demographics don't lie.  Religion in it's former state has a new wrapper and it's not supported by any political group as our founding fathers wanted it.  We are a diverse group.  If you want to belong here then you must give anyone from a religion different from yours complete rights to disagree but no right takes away what are basic human rights even if your religion disagrees.   




 "Have some respect for yourself and date your own species"

Where the fuck did you attend college where they taught that other races like blacks and asians were a separate species from whites?   




 That's the problem. They don't. 
 They only have some governmental pinheads in Saudi and some others in the Middle East that dictate what is and isn't acceptable.  They're are none more eligible to dictate what is right or wrong then my cat.
  Normal Muslims are mostly afraid of the bullies that have invaded the West but I'm not.  If you're listening you cowards and fools, I'm right here in Texas and can't wait.  Best wishes to my real Muslim friends!   




 Yea, I find it bizarre that all the animals got along in Eden but had to start killing and eating each other because of "the Fall of Man". 




 Congratulations, you have just summed up the Patriarchal view.  Until you grow old enough to worship Me and respect Me as your Father I have no use for you.

Matriarchal view.  I will love and protect you while you can't protect yourself.  As you grow I will try to guide you and when you are strong enough you will go out and live a good life. 
Hopefully you'll remember to call me every other weekend.   




 I also think I'm lucky to have been born as an intelligent animal in a country and at a time when expressing my opinions won't be a death sentence! 
 
I believe that the average human commits hundreds of acts of kindness toward fellow humans, animals, and sometimes even the environment everyday.  We do this even if its not convenient, necessary,  beneficial to us or in extreme cases may endanger ourselves.  I believe this is the natural human condition and those that prey on others are in the small minority but cause the vast majority of unnecessary pain and suffering by choosing greed, be it power, fame, control or security because they lack a fundamental connection with humanity.  Sad. 

  To me suffering is a part of life just like death and both are part of the natural world.  What is considered cruel in nature is only a human construct.  Only humans inflict cruelty on each other when they don't need to.  I "think" my cat is being cruel by "playing" with an insect or mouse before he kills it but is he?  Maybe he is perfecting some hunting skill or making sure he won't get stung or bitten.

I know for sure I don't know for sure why my fellow Earthmates do what they do so I'll hold my human-centric judgment on my cat and dolphins for now.  Then again I doubt they give a shit! LOL          




 You made my point and yours.  God's existence can't be proved by perfection.  There is no perfection in nature, only adaptation to available opportunities.  What we think of as cruel in nature when compared to human actions is begging the wrong question. If perfection existed then we wouldn't be having this discussion.

Humans might think the blue-footed boobie is "heartless" when she won't let won't own offspring back into the nest after it falls out or is pushed out by a sibling but I believe it's wrong to place human emotions or judgments on animals.  

I don't think the insect that lays her eggs in the abdomen of another species that in turn eats it way out of it's host is anymore evil then dolphins or hyena's that "rape" each other.  Rather than being pointless, it has lead to the survival of many species.  This doesn't mean human behavior follows suit since we have developed the capacity for long-term consequences.  




 I would hazard a guess but when innocent people are hurt or killed because you gave that person free will just in order to test their devotion to you.....that is evil.  

 




 Would you not agree that the natural world is not evil?  Suffering is a part of nature but unnecessary suffering occurs because of someone's greed.  




 It says He deceived them which is lying.  




 I would say that the struggle for life among animals is amoral and not evil.  Evil, as defined in the bible, is knowing right from wrong but conscientiously choosing wrong.   




 Here comes the textual argument.  I have, have you?  I was confirmed in the church and after finally reading the bible thoroughly and not just what was picked out for me I understood what they were trying to shield me from.   




 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.

Isaiah 45:7

If He doesn't DO evil he damn sure created it which is worse, IMO. 




 Why then does he do it by proxy?  Ezekial 14:9 and 2 Thessalonians 2:11 




 Where does it say in the bible God can't do evil or lie? 




 I haven't ignored you Furo Ergo Sum.  I've been involved with life's distractions otherwise known as reality.  Forgive me.

What I meant my your prejudices is the resistance by you to acknowledge the basic female or baseline development of many organisms.  

Not all animals reproduce sexually.  Some animals such as Aphids that normally reproduce sexually will reproduce asexually through the mother producing only daughters and will only produce males during certain citations.  I can think of no instance when a male organism has ever been able to reproduce asexually.  I'm not saying males are irrelevant in our species but they aren't the go-to sex biologically.

Whether or not you think Jost's experiments mean anything is irrelevant.  Science did and does appreciate his contribution to the understanding of embryology.  You have missed the point. 

I'll try one more time.

For people to get the traits encoded in their genes, the genes need to be turned on. You can think of a gene as a recipe. A recipe in a cookbook does you no good until you open the book, get the ingredients and follow the instructions

The same is true with our genes. In our analogy, the gene is the recipe and the cookbook is the chromosome (a large collection of recipes). The gene needs to be "read" by the cell in order for it to do what it should.  However, the gene may be misread or the chromosomes are faulty. 

By studying why chromosomes/genes act why they do, medical science hopes to understand other medical diseases.

When you add the influence of hormones to the genes it becomes really complicated. 

 




 There was a Seinfeld episode on this as was other little niggling petpeaves on the show. I recall it had to do with the " Bubble Boy" and Jerry trying to follow George down the Parkway.  

Was Jerry driving too slow or was George driving too fast?   Maybe, maybe not.  All I know is I got to use the word niggling in context.   




 Two packaged boiled and peeled eggs.   




 "Methinks you do protest too much!" and with so much mindless moronic cussing and bold face type to try and bolster your points;  you come off as defensive.  I take your response, "who cares" telling.  Obviously you do so and in a big phallic way!  

The original discussion began in an attempt to reconcile genesis with biology and why the bible asserted women came from men and not the other "natural" way around.  You have outed your prejudices by denying the science you claim you aspire a degree in.  Good luck with that young student.

 




 Actually it's the number of old people having sex. 




 I agree with you that it happens not only to teens but way into adulthood also but you don't need to be mean to discover your own self-worth.  It's never justified either in childhood or adulthood. 




 Your assertion that male and female tissues develop in tandem and that only the external genitalia remains ambiguous is wrong (typical guy, only concerned on what's on the outside lol!).  

The Wolffian ducts develops 2 weeks before the Mullarian ducts.  Males will lose all remnants of the M ducts and females will eventually lose the W duct itself but not its undifferentiated gonad.  Those become the ovaries. Without the interference of testosterone and a antiMullarian hormone from the testis the fetus will continue on to develop as a female.  Males will develop their penis and scrotum from what would have become the clitoris and labia folds.

Perhaps during the course of your "studies" you will come across the work of Professor Alfred Jost, a French endocrinologist.  His experiments with rabbits proved that if you removed the undifferentiated gonads the animal will default (his words, not mine) to the female sex.  

After the holiday break go back to school and learn the difference between sex determination, sex differentiation and undifferentiated tissue.  Hopefully then all this will all make sense to you.  If not just ask your professor or better yet, spend hours contemplating your own nipples.  Happy New Year!   




 The cop told me to reschedule my court date and said if he doesn't show up the ticket has to be dismissed if I plead not guilty.  

Turns out if you live in a big city and you reschedule the issuing officer will either not be notified in time or will not be able to be present.  That being said it may just be a Texas law that the officer must be present and it definitively won't work in a small town.      




 Right after 911 when I was in the military I was pulled over in a school zone along with several other cars.  He walked down the line taking our license plates numbers then came up to us individually for our DL and registration.  When he came to me and found out I was military he mumbled, "You have better things to do" and told me how to beat the ticket even though he had to write it.  

It worked and has worked every time I've received any kind of moving violation. 




 Okay, I'll play.  At conception, the zygote has sex chromes that are either XX(female) or XY(male). The mother's egg always gives X but the father's sperm determines the extra X or Y which determines the potential sex of the child.  Sometimes, as in the case with all sexual dimorphism, there will be anomalies such as males having XXY, XXYY or females with only X.  Most will present as males having female attributes due to the lack of the dominate influence of testosterone from the developing organs and the hormonal influence.  

Genes not only determine the sex but they play a part in determining when hormones turn of and on and subsequently how further developments happen.  It's not written in stone guys but it's incrementally important.  

Even the emotional state of the mother can influence production of hormones that can have an effect on her baby.
  




 I doubt you could even make one coherent argument to challenge this opinion.    




 Infuriating isn't it.  I do have one correction for Paxalot.  Although female is the default mode until genes and hormones come into play, the zygote and subsequent fetus aren't really female or male but have the potential for both.  If you must rely on genes themselves it's telling that males are one chromosome off from females and not the other way around. Few die-hard misogynists will even acknowledge the science of embryology like some congress"men" from my state!  

The point though is even with our scientific understanding why do some people subscribe to an ancient mythology that reduces the importance of females and consequently subjugates them to males?    




 Ignorance is understandable.  Willful ignorance is just sad and pathetic.  




 A lot of people think "heroin addict" and just don't get it.  Lots of riders live normal lives as long as they can stave off the withdraw.  You don't get high, you just don't get sick.  Still it's a pretty shitty existance.   




 Pretty much most of my family was/is sociopathic, addicted or manipulative but I've mostly known this since I was a teenager.

That said, the only person in my inner circle that turned out to be really, really bad was my brother-in law.  

I first met him when I was pregnant in the mid nineties.  He had married a woman with a young daughter and she was pregnant with their child.  They had bought a house and seemed happy and normal.  A year later we stayed for a couple of nights with them during vacation.
Never saw anything out of the normal.  He maybe drank a little too much but nothing out of the ordinary for a southern redneck IYNWIM!

After some years they divorced as did I so I only followed my BIL through my ex and son.  Turns out he had a pretty serious drinking problem and eventually spent time in a state prison for a felony DUI where they took his DNA which is standard procedure.

Turns out his DNA turns up as a match for a murder that was nearly 20 old in another state.  The case was featured on TV for unsolved murders.  In short, a mother of two who worked as a dancer at a strip club was found murdered by her two young kids and the babysitter in her trailerhouse two years before I met him. 

An investigation followed and he confessed to her murder.  He's still awaiting trial.  

It still creeps me out that I stayed in the same house with a murderer with my newborn and that my kid grew up around him.    




 I'm not particularly good at rap or poetry so I'll give you my best suggestion.  

You've made millions promoting a thug lifestyle that influenced countless impressionable kids to embrace morals that weren't exactly beneficial to them.  You then had kids of your own and changed your song.  Good for you.  Glad you realized the impression media has on youth.

IMHO, you should rap about being the Scrooge, what with the negative attitude toward the police and then make a video of you rapping about how the police can be your friend and school is cool.

You asked, just sayin'

Good speed to you and your campaign.   




 DamnitGoose now the long needle dicks will feel inadaquate! 




 This is why girls are bad at math! 




 Almost!  My SO was tending a fire and some embers landed on the carpet in front of the hearth and he was so consumed with the fire that he didn't know that our carpet had caught fire.  I put it put with his beer.  




 I'm going to do this and film the results. 
 




 It was only the towels and matches but the worst was the toothpaste in the carpet 




 Even with gas it takes forever to get dry wood to burn. 




 We lost the Scopes Trial just like Evolutionists wanted.  We wanted to take it to the Supreme Court but the judge, just like a sidewinder, devised a way to prevent it by knowingly setting the fine himself to $100 instead of the jury which was supposed to be under $50 and so under the law the verdict was thrown out along with any chance of appeal.  Never underestimate your opponent no matter how misguided. 




 Unless you've been raised in this religion it seems strange the a God has to sacrifice his godson's life to absolve humans of their failings that the Christian god knew would happen in the first place.  What can be gained by having someone else suffer except a sense of guilt.  
  According to the Jews, the real Messiah was not to be the sacrificial lamb that leads to heaven.  The Jewish religion proscribes no heaven nor hell.  The messiah was to lead the Jews from persecution to a peaceful reign of the Jews over this world.  The big change from Judaism to Christianity and Muslim was this point.  Xtians and Muslims focus on a reward in an afterlife and Jews are about a reward in this life.
  Get it?  Got it?   Duh!!!! 




 Listen to the song first. 









 I'll try. A sacrifice means that what you gave can never be returned. Period.  Final.  God never sacrificed his son because he was reincarnated and lives forever within His houses.   




 No, no you don't, at least not in Fort Worth, Texas.   




 Good grief!  Get over the idea that music, art, or even culinary expressions can't be expressed and enjoyed by people of all faiths.

I'm atheist and I love gospel music, the paintings of the ideologues of the Greek Orthodox church, and hot-cross buns.  

Worship is one thing....appreciation is another. 




 Do you really believe that your product is that good?  I mean do you stand behind all the company hype?  I ask this because they have moved into burger heaven areas and after the newness rubs off, all that's left is well a good but not great burger. 




 A better question is why are some Christians obsessed with Biblical literalism especially when it comes to forcing their own views down the throats of American public school children. 
  
  As an atheist, I don't have any problem with an American Indian believing that a tarantula created the earth or any of the other 4,000 or so Creation stories.  Why should I?  Everyone has an opinion and I, as a veteran, defended their ability to hold and cherish them whether right or wrong.

  What I and others have a problem with is when a faction of this country seeks to demand that their religion is supreme above all.  They declare that the majority of our forefathers were Christians so that means we are a Christian nation.  The fact that the majority were Christians doesn't mean their intentions were to make this country's government tied to Christianity in anyway shape or form.  Let me say this again,  The fact that the majority were Christians doesn't mean their intentions were to make this country's government tied to Christianity in anyway shape or form.

Get it?,  Got it?,  Good!

No one is trying to take away any of your rights! Believe what you want, we just don't want taxpayer's money paying for religious symbols for select Americans and unless you want the idea of an intelligent  God-tarantula being taught then let the public schools stick with strict math and science sans the ID stuff. 

Sorry but there's no geological evidence of any world-wide flood but it's not surprising that cultures all over the world can relate to a flood since they happen everywhere.  At least that's what my insurance agent told me lol. 




 You are pretty fucking stupid and don't deserve any disability from SS and if your Ins. paid then you should pay them back for your own stupidity.  Sorry about your crappy looking toes but it doesn't beat my uncle when he raised up the running lawnmower and sliced of several of the tips of his fingers.  You both belong in a pile of morons and drive up the cost of insurance! 




 Owls?  I love owls.  Owls love to eat.  Owls love to eat rodents.  Owls also love to eat a small rodent like Chihuahua dog that lives next door that likes to yip and bark for hours on end.  Yea owls!  I love owls.  And hawks, vultures, ect.  Did I say I love owls? 




 As I load their bags with candy I think I'll whisper, "In Satan's name.". LOL 




 Prayer, in its simplest form that I was taught as a child is NOT asking  God or Jesus any help for me or anyone else. Prayer is not to ask for special favors even when you want something that you think is special.

Praying is only to acknowledge, reflect and confirm your faith in Jesus and not some magical path for health or prosperity for you or your family to (lose) pay money into.
 Please don't be mislead!
If even two people pay attention to me and recognize not only the religious scams churches use, but they will enlist your help to place your elderly parents or relative in a substandard retirement home where they receive kickbacks. Sounds lovely?! Don't bet on any of it.  They will take your money and spend it on new golf clubs before the ink is signed on your parents contract! 




 The gospels provide clues to the life of Jesus but the actual life and death of Jesus was never and has never been corroborated by any outside sources including the Romans' that had this habit of recording everything that they could. 




 I won't say that this film was misunderstood as the film didn't reflect the original story but the damage was done to the collective conscience of the viewing public and the original story was lost.  I refer to the original "Frankenstein".

The movie made the story out to be a cautionary tale about the evils and limits of scientific exploration, portraying the monster as a non-verbal, grunting, sub-human. The book, in fact, portrays the monster helping an unknowing family and learns how to communicate in French. Later, he gives a touching soliloquy to his maker that turned his back on him.  

The book was not a tale of science over-extending itself but a commentary of how a society can turn a person with potential empathy and intelligence into what they define is a monster.  The latter being much more scary and relevant to modern society!  




 "Death is from sin nature"

The idea of original sin has been a sticking point for me since I was a child.  To conscientiously punish the progeny for a mistake their parents made is akin to justifying a caste system.  Your parents screwed up so I'm gonna make your existence while you're alive almost unbearable but if you praise me enough I'll reward you after I let you die which I don't have to do but because your parents disobeyed me, who didn't know any better because I never taught them what disobedience meant because I didn't want them to know any better. This made no sense to the naive 10 year old me then it does now.

My great-grandfather was a Baptist preacher. I was confirmed into the Episcopalian Church at age 10 and have been studying various religions including Christianity for the past 40 years.  Some things have become clear to me concerning Christianity.

A great deal of guilt is laid on Christian children just for being born. They are told that because of original sin sex is bad but necessary and even their future death is also because of sin.  All this adds up to atonements, offerings, sacrifices to the priests that can direct them to a way to escape death and live forever, (which as far as I know, no one has been able to do) and makes the priests, reverends, popes etc., rich while robbing the hopeful yet gullible. 
  
The sad thing is that while pinning their hopes on an "afterlife" they neglect and dismiss a precious opportunity of self-conscientiousness that is the rare occurrence of life. 

Instead of embracing and cherishing what they have, they claim that this fragile life on this fragile planet means nothing.

You talk about moral absolutes and call me a hypocrite but all I know is that I only have this life as a human on this planet and I will cherish and help future life here as long as it lasts.

Death is the rebirth of life and it's natural and OK!
    




 What?  I've been drinking straight from the cartons since I was I kid. Oh no, suddenly I feel sic..... 




 Who Louis Armstrong was.  When I was stationed in New Orleans I found out that my boyfriend, who was from Pittsburg, PA didn't know who he was even though the airport there is named after him. He had been there for over three years.  It's a wonderful world! 




 It does and I can understand your dilemma.  I apologize for some of the conclusions I jumped to.

I had to pull some strings to get stationed where my parents were.  My 4'3" mother had to have a double hernia surgery from lifting my 6'2" step-dad after his heart surgery and stroke and they needed my help.  After I got there I found out that they owed the IRS $6500 or they would lose their house.  I took out a loan and paid the IRS. I stayed there for another year rent free to recoup the loan.  I thought about buying the house but because of foundation problems I decided not to. 

They eventually settled on a reverse mortgage which worked out well.

However, I did this with an income of around $43,000.  How you bought a $180,000 home on an income of only 18k at the time or even 25k makes anyone wonder. 

Good on ya and at least, even if it's an after thought, you are  taking care or advantage of your relatives. 

Good luck to you sir! 
 




 "Its my dad's place. he was not well so I came back and am helping with everything. sister moved back in and mom was losing her place (they are divorced but its friendly) so she moved in too."

So you came back to your dad's place to help by having him move in with you? You're not being coherent.  




 Just responding to your response actually concerning the house.  It was you that indicated the house was still owned by your father. JS 




 Jesmay, have you ever really read the bible cover to cover on your own without someone there to interpret it for you?  No matter, I have and I will give you just one passage:

Isaiah 13:15-18 NLT

Bueno noches! 




 Once again, since you aren't legally responsible to pay the property and school tax for your parents, it doesn't count as your tax burden for the purpose of your argument.  When I agreed to pay my parents' property tax it was only to help them; the same as if I paid their electric bill, bought a new AC unit for their home, or even sent them on their dream vacation to Italy.  I still paid my own taxes and because it wasn't my home I couldn't write off or apply my VA disability discount on my federal returns. 

It's nice that you're "helping" your parents but it sounds like you are definitely receiving a benefit here because you're not paying rent.  Having lived in PA I know that $7612 a year would be considered pretty cheap rent for for renting a house that size.  Also it's interesting that you collect the rental income from a property you don't own and report that as personal income.  

Sounds like you have positioned yourself into a comfortable situation where you can live rent free on only 18k plus; supplementing your income by renting rooms in your parents house to other relatives.  

Good job! You still misrepresented yourself, have offered no argument about the ACA and have shown yourself to be a opportunistic moocher and family blood-sucker.  Did it ever occur to you that when they leave/or die it may not be yours?  Maybe so but from what I gather you've probably made sure the will is in order to your benefit.

This sounds like a clear -cut case of elder abuse to me!
