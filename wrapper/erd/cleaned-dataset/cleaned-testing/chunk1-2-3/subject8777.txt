 I dont always hit a women, but when I do I make sure I knock her to the floor no questions asked 




 Looks like a classy establishment y'all stayed at.. 




 I like how it says, "Our Goal, Totally Satisfied" because when I get my car towed that is the complete opposite of what I am.. 




 GOJO in the bottom right corner...they know whats really going on.. 




 I bet they all rode their fixies there, and then smoked cigarettes. 




 Its funny to me that this person decided to take a picture at this moment. 




 and what was nailed now?

 It's Arizona to start..
 









 God Bless New York City! 









 Thats how I look when Im standing next to my friends 














 well I appreciate you keeping me busy while I wait to do my rounds, but now I must go do them so I have to be on my way, but I am sure we will run into each other again on this here internet thing! 




 i wouldnt say people dont know what they want in life but it is more of a "how do i get there" problem, in my opinion 




 thats why you always gotta have your other shit to keep you sane, trust me if I just had this job, id kill myself bc overnights suck balls. But I know that this is just a paycheck for me and the real fun happens once I get off! its all a matter of tolerance 




 oh well yea man ride the college train as long as you can, no point in fucking up school for minimum wage anyway. Everyone says find a job you love and get paid for it, but thats kind of bullshit in my mind. Find a job to survive and do the things you love because you love them, even if it doesnt pay.. 




 living the dream my friend, getting paid to troll haha...you are my age, why cant you find work? 




 to kill time during my overnight shift..ah win! 









 With a laptop.

 Schnell, it could be worse

 When suddenly you decided to take a picture while driving because it wouldnt have been there if you had pulled over..

 naw... 




 This will destroy you rocks faces off! EITS and Mogwai both get my blood pumping! Old Yndi Halda is good stuff too! 
























 Hahaha we meet again my good friend! 




 To that i would say we are not trying to go for that wow factor all the time as we would like to see our music be used for things such as movies, commercials, sports films..etc so we like to leave space in the music and without a singer we understand that there isnt always something there that will grab and hold the occasional post rock listener, but that is ok for us. The songs have their moments that grab you and thats all we want, the rest is up to you :) 




 Hahaha thanks, someone at the bar the other night made the same comment and I had to google it to see bc I couldnt remember..good call tho  




 We are putting it out there ourselves with the intent of it being used for film and/or commercial work so we would like to make the money that way and not by way of sales, so with that said we will not be selling it but making it available online for free download to anyone who asks..but with any luck the album should be done by then end of this year or the very beginning of next..it comes down to how quick i can mix it all hahaha..keep an ear out tho and facebook is how we keep everyone updated so check that periodically too :) thanks again tho and good ear on the semi circle comment! 




 Thanks soooo much brotha!! I appreciate that!! 




 They are live recordings ;) and nice call on the semi-circle...did u see the video? 




 Thanks soo much man! I really appreciate you taking a listen to the music and i am happy you enjoi it! Pass it along and if youd like the link to the online free download let me know and keep an ear out for the full length cd that should be coming out sometime before the new year :) facebook of course too blah blah blah
