 This whole "neckbeard" thing seems to be a growing trend. Are they trying grooming their facial hair to look like this, or is it actually their best effort to grow facial hair? As for fedoras, I have no clue why someone who isn't in a swing band would wear one.

Both of these posts deserve to be made fun of because they are important topics relevant to many reddit users.

 Seriously, though, what is this? What's with the countdown? Should I be worried? Is there a prize at the end? 





























 I know there's a relatively small amount of it in tobacco products, but how much of it ends up being absorbed by your body? 









 Why not Zuckerzoid? 



























































 I know that it is definitely used elsewhere, but how much? Is there a way of tracking how much it is used in a nation's media outlets and using that data as some sort of quantifier for how negative or positive the connotations of "liberal" are in a specific country?

 Please no upboats, updogs, uprons, or ronvotes. Thanks you in advance for the gold, kind stranger.  









 EDIT: This is my first time getting gold, and I'd like to thank whoever it was that gifted it. I tried finding out who it was, but I'm not very computer savvy. I ended up accidentally downloading a terabyte of child porn and now I'm under arrest.

 There is NOTHING shitty about peanut butter. EVER. You hear me? You could spread PB on a turd and I would happily eat it. 




 I liked having a tall locker. The smaller ones were hard to get into if the dude below you was fucking around in theirs. I once had a small locker (a bottom one), and the person who had the locker above mine left a sandwich in theirs throughout the Christmas break. The smell of rotten salami and mayonnaise made its way into my locker and stayed there for the rest of the year. The few articles of clothing I left behind over the break smelled, my gym shoes smelled (and not like my sweaty feet), and worst of all my text books smelled. I had to throw out everything except the text books, because I couldn't just replace those --they were way too expensive. I used those text books for the rest of the year, even though they stunk up every classroom they entered.  
  
TL;DR - don't rent a small locker. 




 Take it easy, buuuuuuuuuuuuuud-day.

 I always thought that packaging in the food industry was limited to one product (or at most, two or three similar food products) per machine.

 On closer inspection (now that I'm on a computer and not my phone) I can say I'm almost certain that is not a fallstreak hole. What you have there looks like a small gap in a layer of stratocumulus cloud, which is actually pretty common. It could be because of the way the cloud is forming or dissipating, or it could just be that the clouds are moving in such a way as to form a gap. Fallstreak holes usually only occur in mid to high level convective clouds, such as altocumulus and cirrocumulus. 




 Yep, that's a fallstreak hole.
