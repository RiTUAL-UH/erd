 Why zero research skills? I'm looking for the stuff that is not easily found. Yea I've typed in "best beaches San Diego" in Google, but I'm looking for the local specialties. 




 Oh yea, I'm completely aware. I plan on attending all law networking events available. Are you in the law industry? Do you have any specific suggestions for getting a leg up? 




 Thanks for the laugh. I'm sure I'll hear them 1000 more times. +1 




 Hey guys, me and my girlfriend just moved to the area from Texas. We are both attending law school. I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions on pretty much everything: beaches to visit, clubs to see downtown, restaurants to eat at, and anything else you can think of. Thank you in advance, sorry to invade. 




 Even better there's a computer program that can draw districts in the "shortest spitline." It is completely unbiased and draws it where the amount of people fit in the lines. 




 Call up the contact from that website again and say you never signed a lease and request that the website requests proof of a signed lease and if none is provided then it be removed from your history. If you pay a lawyer a small fee, they will probably write it for you which will be a lot scarier for this website and likely make them more responsive. 




 Just in case adoptive kids read this part and see "chose not to abandon me when that would have been the easy choice," I would like to point out that many families who choose to adopt out their children are making the choice to do so to give the kid a better life, and simply don't have the solid family structure you were blessed to have. Most adoptive parents see it as their suffering for the betterment of the child. 




 www.bigwords.com and type in all your ISBN numbers, then click to include international editions. It will tell you where to buy the cheapest bundle of all your books, and you can include rentals and everything. 




 So still don't go to a low ranked law school and if you go to a high ranked school make sure you go with a big scholarship. This is the same advice you would have been given in 2011. Would anyone here have told a student not to attend a top 30 school with a big scholarship even then?

 Go check out the discussion over on /r/MMA, this very thing happened yesterday with a male fighter finding his girlfriend in bed with another guy. Complete opposite reactions. 




 I'm sure most of the people here don't follow the sport mixed martial arts but just to fill everyone in, there is a fighter named War Machine (real name), who is dating a porn star and he reportedly beat her after finding her in bed with another guy. Over on /r/MMA, there has been lots of discussion of this and the consensus is it's wrong no matter what he found her doing. Anyway I just wanted to point out that the double standards are pretty sickening. 




 I would offer no more than 20%. I realize that is drastically different than what you were thinking, but realize that your friend is only bringing the good credit. That's nothing. You could find that with a Craigslist ad coupled with an attorney written contract giving you all the rights to revenue, and I assure you many people with only credit would take that. 




 Just curious, but what's the split? 




 George RR Martin is pretty unhealthy and will probably die before he finishes Game of Thrones. 




 Agreed. Let's look at 2 other scenarios: 1) Someone wants to frame him. If they wanted to frame him for cheating there are a hell of a lot better ways to do it than setting up profiles with his picture and fake names and minimal info (which is what he says is on the accounts) then just HOPING that his wife or one of her friends finds the accounts and rats him out. 2) It's some guy who thinks OP is of godly looks and is using his profile to pull in chicks. In this case, they got his pictures off FB. OK Cupid and such are LOCAL websites. What are the odds that this random dude using his random pictures would set up profiles within his same exact 50 mile radius.

On the other hand, if he wants to cheat while out of town on business, he would probably be setting up profiles in those cities, not his own. And it is possible that the wife's friend who "found out" set them up if she has a personal vendetta against OP. Or even that one of OP's friends set up the profile with his picture and is using it to bait in girls. I just think these are less likely than OP being a cheater.

Honestly, I have no idea, but I'm leaning more towards the fact that this post is just to get ideas for a cover up. 




 I just realized how much Zach Braff will look like Ray Romano in 20 years. 




 Whatever you're comfortable with. Extremely risky: 15%, average risk: 7%, super safe: 5% as examples. 




 Wouldn't it be even smarter then to make your whole ad 5 seconds long then just black screen the rest of the time? Then the person sees your whole ad but and will always skip after its over and you never have to pay. 




 Define the odd phone calls.

As for reserving a room, she was heading to the mountains, of course she is reserving a room. She's not gonna party out in the woods. 




 Why not just wait another few months until Aldo is ready and do Edgar/Swanson in the meantime for #1 contender? 




 You know it always really bugs me that they never count Aldo's defenses from WEC in there. I mean the WEC FW division became the UFC FW division and was seen as the premier place for FW's even when it was the WEC. They should say Zuffa belt defenses, or even UFC/WEC belt defenses, not just UFC belt defenses.

Aldo has held the belt longer than Jones and had more defenses. Granted the competition hasn't been up to par with Jones' but people always cite stats like these to show why Aldo is above Jones in P4P rankings. 




 Although I completely disagree with charging anyone for any crime here, if they insist on charging the underage boy shouldn't they also charge the underage girl with possession and manufacturing of child pornography especially since she started it? 




 I mean that one sounds pretty straightforward, no?

Theory: Girl invited to party, empties bank account b/c she's an irresponsible college undergrad, buys alcohol b/c of same reason, drinks on the way up, hits snow b/c drunk, tells person not to call police b/c she was drunk driving, then hitchhikes with the wrong person and gets murdered.

I mean they found red stains that they assume are from red wine. Of course she didn't want police called after she crashed while drinking and driving. 




 If it is truly valued at $200K now and $220K with $15K worth of work, but I doubt it. It's much more likely that $20K worth of work will cause it to sell for $220K. The market is very good at being efficient. I am a former real estate agent and my suggestion would be to sell it as-is, unless all other condos in the area are selling with improvements, and yours is not, then act accordingly. 




 "Proceed." 




 Exactly, Nader can warn all he wants against Clinton but I'd rather have Clinton than abortion made illegal again, no chance for gay marriage, no chance for further healthcare reform, less investment in green energy, and no minimum wage reform. 




 What country, or if in the US what industry? 




 Dana has routinely paid both guys if there is a last minute cancellation. 




 That's actually still not entrapment. The law defines entrapment as a police officer convincing a citizen to commit a crime they would not have otherwise committed AND that a reasonable person would not commit.

An example of actual entrapment: A police officer runs up to a person on the street yelling they have just been poisoned and there is an antidote in that store, but the store is closed and he must break a window and take the antidote. The citizen is arrested after he breaks in and steals the antidote.

A reasonable person would steal the antidote, but not buy crack even after being harassed. 




 Just read the whole story and watched your trailer. It looks really cool! Where will you be posting it? Like which subreddit? 




 These people probably shouldn't be driving... 




 Yea this was baffling. The dad disputes the kid did anything wrong then grounds him? Sounds like he's taking out his anger over getting arrested on the kid. 




 How did the dad support multiple kids with a job a McDonalds is the real question? 




 Technically, it means she would potentially sleep with any guy with a girlfriend, her boyfriend included, but not exclusively. 




 Yeeeesh that was brutal. The most interesting part by far was the fact that SPOILER ALERT: the guy's wants to kill himself after the accident and everybody's saying let him kill himself if he wants to die and is in that much pain, then he goes on to make a fantastic recovery with wife, kids, and attend law school. 




 Life and Death Decisions

Awesome teacher, awesome class, super interesting. Extremely informative. Easy tests. Opt out of the final. Man I could go on and on about that class.

Edit: And no presentation or speeches. 




 Incoming 1L taking this advice to heart right now. I appreciate the sacrifice. 




 If many people in the company are entitled to it then I think your best bet would be for you guys to all meet together with a lawyer and outline the story and see if you have a case.

Other posters are right, $400 for one person isn't worth a lawsuit, but for 20+ people, it is more reasonable.

Most of the time, a simple letter from a lawyer would be enough to scare the company into complying. 




 Hi.

I'll preface this with the fact that I'm not an excon and I only subscribed to this sub because I'm interested. However I am a undergraduate who is heading into a graduate program this Fall so I know things from that side a tiny bit.

I have been in the legal system for minor charges, some of which I pleaded not guilty and they dropped immediately after and one of which I went to court and was proven not guilty by a jury.

It was a minor charge that I beat in court and I was 100% guilty of it, and I was a 19 year old pompous kid, but it was a misdemeanor Minor in Possession charge so I don't feel too bad for misrepresenting some stuff.

The major fact I took away was, it's not what is true, it's what appears true. Like that Training Day quote where Denzel talks about "It's what you can prove."

Well, what I'm getting from your case is that there is little "proof" on either side. Do the discovery, find out what they have on you. Also did you take pictures or any proof of your injuries?

Now you go up on the stand, look as innocent as possible, seem exasperated and just be emotional and work in to the jury that you just don't want to go to jail for something you didn't do and the other damage it's had on your life. SEEM innocent.

After it's over 1 of 2 things will happen: Not Guilty, you walk away learning a valuable lesson or Guilty and you go to jail most likely and when you get out, you talk to any employers and tell them the full story and hope one of them believes your story. Now let me tell you what you get if you just plead Guilty. Most likely, employers will not believe if you tell them you are not really guilty but plead guilty because you were scared. Unless they are in the position, it's almost impossible for people to comprehend that people will plead guilty to a crime they did not commit. Again this is all just my opinion and you are free to do whatever you want.

Also, I don't know about you, but for me I would not be able to plead guilty purely based on principle. I would rather do a year I got sentenced to after a full trial than 6 months I plead guilty to.

I would like to add one last note that I am not a typical poster here and I have never been to jail/prison so I am likely talking out of my ass when I say I would rather do the year I didn't earn than the 6 months I condemned myself to, but this is all just an opinion for you to take into account and decide for yourself.

In any case, good luck man. I sincerely hope you the truth prevails. 




 Can you stop downvoting me just because you disagree?

And that's not a response. You're just dodging the question but whatever fine. 




 Just to be clear: you are saying you don't think he needs even a few thousand though in case his car breaks down or there is a medical emergency, because that is what I advocated for and you seemed to disagree. Is that right? 




 It would be naive to think his expense are $0. He obviously pays for lunch, most likely his gas and probably insurance, entertainment, etc.

He should obviously have money for the loan payments and/or a car breaking down AT THE MINIMUM. Are you advocating he have no emergency fund because we assume his parents can/would help him? 




 I disagree. I think 6 months of whatever his expenses may be is appropriate. If that is only food, gas, phone and insurance then I think he should save 6 months of that, which would only presumably be around $3500 or so. And everyone wants an emergency fund that size if for example their car breaks down or something of that nature. 




 I'm sure even you miss a line here and there when casually browsing reddit. Or no? 




 Just remember:

1) Make a budget
2) Emergency fund with 6 months expenses
3) EMERGENCY FUND WITH 6 MONTHS EXPENSES
4) Put all excess in student loans 




 So highly paid, elite athletes get paid more? 




 When they wrote "his address" in the article, those words were hyperlinked to his actual address. 




 Used to watch every UFC, the whole card through, every pre and post press conference, watch every interview, and even watch the 2nd tier promotions (DREAM, Strikeforce, etc) but now I watch only the main cards of some of the UFCs, not really the TUF Finales or anything like that. 




 Just to piggyback on the top comment, even if a drug with euphoric effects was created that didn't have any physical adverse effects, it would still have mental adverse effects.

Imagine a drug that produces a high and you never have to worry about ODing or having a hangover or any other health effects. Would you take it every day? Would you spend your last dollar on it instead of eating some days? Would you steal in order to get money for it? 




 It's better than the previous status quo. Pre-existing conditions and no medicare just because you don't have a kid, not to mention lifetime caps and being dropped by your insurance if you develop a condition. 




 More like pacman. 




 The salesman thing lines up with what others said in the other thread. Have him attempt to get a job at a home improvement store. As said in the other thread they like to hire older people and he has sales experience and they can teach him the tools part. 




 I don't understand how the judge could possibly deny the biological father the right to be named on the birth certificate.

I feel like that happens all the time in cases of straight couples using surrogacy. 




 They put their sperm with an egg of a donor woman, then implanted that fertilized egg in a 3rd woman.

Also, why do you not support it? 




 I'm pretty sure it's going to depend on the dynamics of the child with the parents. If the child is indifferent towards the dad but close to the mom, and the dad has full time custody then the child will be unhappy and vice versa.

My parents had 50/50 custody when I was in elementary school and it was the absolute worst. Literally every day I was asking who would pick me up and occasionally the parent who was supposed to pick me up would forget.

The only thing I can say for sure that if this is studied, 50/50 is most likely to be the worst. 




 Agreed. I think he could have beaten Texiera if he had his head in the game. He just got to overconfident, just like against Lyoto. Although I do think he would have lost to Lyoto even if he hadn't rushed in. 




 The Keith Jardine fight?

I don't recall them being legal, are you sure?

Edit: 1:30 mark http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hl475QNxCM
Definitely illegal. 




 PS3 reporting in. Not gonna spend $400 just to spend $60 as much as I want to play this game. 




 staph, just FYI 




 No, nothing has changed. Can you provide a video or rough time period in a fight where an upkick that connected to the head of a down opponent was no called by a ref? 




 Hey, so you seem to have it down pretty well. But I have one last suggestion. Do your parents have bad credit at all?

If they apply for a PLUS loan and get denied, you are able to take additional unsubsidized Stafford loans in your own name only, and at a good interest rate (comparatively to private loans).

If not, then just go private loans with your parents as cosigners. 




 That was $12K each year. The guy has 2 years left, he should be able to take a break for 2 years before working the rest of his life. 




 Hey guys, I was one of the redditors who helped Tim Kennedy do his AMA.

Just FYI, he said they have about 30 fighters ready for DLC content and are just gonna be adding fighters as they go. 




 I'm not sure if /u/Mr_asdfghjkl was implying it was a bitch move because of the circumstances or just in general but I'll throw out my thoughts.

I would like to see soccer kicks/stomps legalized but it was still a bitch move because it was illegal, and the other guy knew it was. If it was legal, it wouldn't be a bitch move. 




 The Sims and GTA5

I want to lead a normal family life with a job as an accountant, then go out and rob banks with my crew on weekends. 




 There are 7 different last names in his list of grandparents, parents, and children. 




 You think Republicans will have a 2/3 majority in the House AND Senate? You're wrong. 




 I was the other guy who helped with the AMA at Tim's house. I asked for a pic and he immediately asked for a leg kick at "about a 7 or an 8" out of 10. Looked like it hurt. 




 Because Dems have the Senate and nothing Democrats really really hate would ever get through the Senate and thus he would never be able to veto it. Trust me, if they start passing stuff that the Dems don't want, he will veto it. 




 Still won't matter. Obama will veto anything that makes it through and R's don't have 2/3 majority in House and Senate. 




 Dude had some hilarious answers for his AMA. I was cracking up typing some of them. 




 Hey guys I was one of the guys he chose to help with his AMA just cause I live in Austin. He was a really cool dude! Me and the other guy just helped type up responses while he dictated, but we typed it word for word. He gave us each a signed glove and we got to see his dogs and meet his wife. He seems really down to earth. I got a pic with him, and the other guy asked Tim to give him a leg kick (there was a video, I'll let him post it if he wants). 




 The Republican nominee and Democratic nominee for this race are both teachers at the same college. 




 Out of the 6 people living in that house, 5 are unclassy and you are alright with 1. 




 I'm gonna be working there tomorrow from 7-7!

I get to serve the athletes and their families food. 




 I just saw the first showing of this movie today, opening day, and WOW it was a really great movie. Not what I expected. Tom Cruise actually played a type of character I had never seen him as before.

He wasn't the futuristic guy from Oblivion, nor the super-agent type from that one movie with Cameron Diaz. Cruise was scared, unsure of himself and a refreshingly great character. The movie itself shattered all of my expectations, which weren't great as I didn't expect much and went on student discount Thursday night as I didn't think it was worth full price, but oh how wrong I was.

Also, the comedy, my god I was laughing out loud at many parts in the movie and you will too.

Seriously go see it and thank me later.

Sidenote: There's another disaster movie coming out in a very 2012-ish vein and it looks even worse.

 I have loans from undergrad: subsidized govt, unsubsidized govt and unsub private. Will the subsidized ones continue to be subsidized while I am in grad school (law school) as long as I am full time?

I am going straight from undergrad to law school. Do I have to notify any of the loan servicers (even the private ones) that I will still be in school or will they be automatically notified so that my payment period does not start? 














 All my acceptances are starting to come in and while I have a great GPA, I only did decently on the LSAT and I'm looking at going to a lower-ish ranked school.

My question is: While looking at the ABA profiles of schools, I noticed some have really high attrition rates. They break it down by "Academic" and "Other" but also have Transfers Out. Are transfers out counted in attrition rates? If so, which category? Does Academic mean failed out or does Other? I searched google and the ABA website and could not find the answers to these questions.

I know it is generally frowned upon for 0L's to post here, but I think this question can help a lot of others. Thanks for taking the time. 









 Sorry if I'm posting in the wrong place. Perhaps I could be directed to the correct place if this is not the right subreddit.

Here's my problem. Yesterday, all at once, the clock stopped working in my car (the little LED one that is right next to the temperature display, which still works), the remote that locks/unlocks the car no longer works, the trunk button in the car does not open the trunk, and when I turn my car off, usually I can still close the windows, but now I have to have the car on to close the windows.

I've checked all fuses. I've check the battery. Everything is good. The car is a 1998 Toyota Avalon.

Perhaps one of you more knowledgeable folks might point me in the right direction? I don't know much about cars and any help in appreciated. 














 I'm just confused, because California could have just put up a shitty defense, then the losing side would appeal up to the SCOTUS and they would be FORCED to make a decision. By striking down DOMA, we can ascertain that the Court clearly have the votes in favor of marriage equality. 









 Hey /r/MMA, so I'm in summer courses majoring in economics and currently taking an upper division Economics Statistics course. Well, my teacher assigned us a project (I only have a brief overview of it now, will have exact details of it tomorrow) to do a numerical statistics analysis on discrete numerical data in which our sample size is over 30. She specifically said we could do it in sports. Obviously as a huge MMA fan, I'd like to do mine in MMA.

So I'm looking for everyone's input on some cool statistics I could analyze and I will of course share the full results of the project with everyone here so that could be cool right?

To cover a quick few things:
1. it has to be numerical, not categorical so I cannot do things such as types of finishes;
2. it has to be discrete meaning a specific number (ex. # of strikes per round, not weight of each fighter- which fluctuates);
3. sample size has to be over 30 so if I'm analyzing one person's fights it has to be someone with more than 30 of them, but I could analyze all champions fights; 
4. I don't want this to be a comparison across weight classes where there are already many predictable patterns;
5. don't pitch an idea that is insanely hard such as analyzing every single fighter in the UFC for the past 10 years;
6. keep in mind I can also analyze #'s that aren't takedowns, strikes, etc. such as viewers for shows, salaries and more.


Thanks! And I look forward to sharing the project with you guys! 




 Not sure if this is the right sub but.... I'm looking at law schools and when I see them according to US News, it show's the average indebtedness at graduation for each school. My question is: does this include undergraduate debt as well?

The definition provided on the website states: "Average indebtedness of 2012 graduates who incurred law school debt." As you can see, this does not clear up my issue. So if anyone with any insight can help, I'd be thankful. 




 Hi, I am a student and subleased my apartment for the summer. Over Craigslist, I met a Law Student (ironically) who agreed to sublease my room. He moved in and lived there from the 12 until 25th of May (today) and when rent was due, he sent me a text saying he has moved out. He said I could keep the deposit and left a $100 check for utilities from the time he lived there (it was only like $40). I immediately texted back asking if he could call to discuss it. He responded, declining.

I went to the apartment and found the check as well as him completely moved out. My question is, do I have legal recourse as he signed a lease in which I explicitly outline the deposit, rent amount, move in and move out dates, and he signed and sent a copy of his drivers license? He signed this agreement and I have emails from his official .edu email address in which he signs his full name and has his schools listed at the bottom. I also have texts confirming his move in date and confirmation that the lease was signed.

A friend told me that I could possibly be out of luck as I did not get the contract notarized. Is this true or does it simply decrease my chances of winning a judgement from him, considering I have the emails, texts, drivers license, and signed contract (signed by both of us)?

I live in Texas, and the reason he cited for moving out was originally that the hot water and dishwasher don't work (they do) and when I called him out on that he said the place wasn't clean (it was reasonably vacuumed, swept, and counters wiped when he moved in). He is now not responding to any texts of mine in which I ask him to call me. I have not threatened the lawsuit yet, but I plan on filing in small claims court as of Tuesday (Monday is a holiday).

Thank you all for your time and help. 









 ***Hi guys, I am an American student taking Danish here in Texas. I know lots of you have helped me before editing my papers and I want to thank you guys. I am now on my very last paper for Danish, and after this I just take the oral exam and written final exam and I am done with my Danish studies. I want to thank this subreddit as a whole for helping me learn Danish, and a special thanks to /u/Neovitami and /u/Solgudinde who have helped edit many of my papers. I just didn't want to keep burdening them, so I come to you all for my last paper.

The topic for this paper is about a vacation we want to go on. I went away from the topic a bit and wrote about an adventure I wish to have. If you just edit it by bolding my mistakes (spelling and grammar) I would be very thankful.***


Den ferie jeg nsker, er at bestige Mount Everest. Det ligger i Nepal. Det har vret min drm lige siden jeg var lille til st p toppen af verden. Jeg har planlagt denne ferie i lang tid, og det bliver meget spndende, nr jeg har penge til at tage. Jeg bliver ndt til spare op masser og masser af penge, fr jeg kan rejser der. Og s jeg bliver ndt til finde en guide, der vil hjlpe med at guide mig op bjerget. Jeg bliver ogs ndt til at trne. Jeg skal have masser af erfaring klatring andre bjerge, fr jeg kan forsge til bestige det hjeste en. Jeg bliver ndt til spise rigtigt, s jeg kan vre meget sundt. Jeg vil spise masser af frugt og grntsager, og jeg vil g lber hver dag. Sidste til at blive klar til min eventyr, vil jeg ndt til samle det rigtige udstyr. Jeg vil kbe en klatring kse, klatring sko, og masser af varmt tj. Jeg vil ogs kbe en srlig sovepose og telt. Og jeg kan ikke glemme at kbe en brndeovn at lave mad varme mltider!

Frst jeg vil flyve p et fly til Kathmandu, hovedstaden i Nepal. S vil jeg vandre fra Kathmandu til Everest basislejr. Denne vandretur er omkring 100 kilometer lang og tager ca 4 dage. S jeg vil bo i basislejr i 10 dage eller deromkring. Dette vil give min lunge at akklimatisere sig til den hje hjde, basislejr ligger p. S jeg klatre til Camp 1, s Camp 2, derefter Camp 3, da Camp 4, og endelig til topmdet! Hele eventyr vil tage omkring en mned for at afslutte. Det vil ogs koste en masse penge! Men jeg vil fle sig en stor flelse af realisering, s det vil vre umagen vrd for mig.
Mens andre mennesker nsker at rejser p ferier, hvor de kan slappe af, lide i Caribien, jeg nsker at rejser p en ferie, hvor jeg kan opleve en stor liv eventyr.

Jeg har boet i Austin hele mit liv. Byen er vokset meget siden jeg blev fdt her. Jeg elsker Austin. Jeg tror, det er den bedste by i verden. Den har alle fordelene ved at bo i Texas, men det er meget forskelligt fra andre byer i Texas. Austin er stor nok, at det er interessant, men lille nok til at det er let at kre fra den ene ende til den anden hurtigt. Austin er den mest unikke by jeg har hver besgt, og jeg er stolt af at bo her.

Jeg elsker Austin, fordi der er altid noget at gre. Der er masser af butikker for at kbe ting i. I Austin, kan du tage vandreture p Greenbelt. Eller du kan sejle p sen. Eller du kan kre rundt sporet p Town Lake. Der er ogs mange steder fantastisk til datoer. Du kan tage til Mount Bonnell og se solnedgangen. Eller du kan fodre nderne i Zilker Park. Hvis du nsker at feste, er der masser af barer p 6th street. Der er ogs masser af levende musik i barer og klubber. En anden aktivitet at gre, er at besge det Texas State Capitol og lre alt om historien af Texas.

Jeg elsker ogs at i Austin, der er masser af aktiviteter at gre p ferie. I marts kan du se live musik og film p South By Southwest festival. I marts kan du ogs flyve med drager p Austin Kite Festival. I juli kan du se fyrvrkeri p Town Lake for 4. juli fester. I september kan du tage til Zilker Park og deltage Austin City Limits, en kmpe musikfestival. I december kan du tage p Trail of Lights og se masser af juledekorationer.

Og sidst, har vi det bedste universitet i hele Texas, University of Texas, hvor du kan lre noget, selv dansk! 




 This happened about 4-5 hours ago. So here it is, several days after Valentines day and I'm walking on my college campus with my girlfriend to go pick up a package her mom had sent her containing lots of Valentines day candy and such.

Well we pick up the package and walk about 20 feet when out of NOWHERE a tall skinny kid about 18-20 years old comes running and grabs the package from my hands. But here's the thing, **he's maniacally laughing the entire time.** First thought that entered my mind is I'm trying to see if I know the kid from class or a club or something, nope. Quick glance to my girlfriend next to me says she doesn't know him either.

So then after about 20 seconds of trying to grab the package, he rips it open and candy goes flying everywhere. At this point, we are in the middle of the hallway in one of the busiest buildings on campus. The kid starts trying to wrestle me. Sweet. I trained in MMA for about a year, so I know some stuff. I immediately go for a trip takedown, and when he puts his hands on the floor to stand up, I sink in a rear naked choke. First  I'm not squeezing that hard, but then I get pissed thinking how much of a pain he caused me. By the way, I'm borderline sick today and the only reason I even went to school was because I had a huge test. Add this to the fact that I'm lugging around a 30 pound backpack with books, binders and laptop, and you could see why I'm pissed when someone tries this crap on me. So here I am, applying the choke, and all these college kids (about 30 or so) have formed a big circle around me and a bunch of girls start screaming that I'm gonna kill him, and I can tell I'm about to put him to sleep, so I loosen the choke.

Oh and I've got my 30 pound backpack on this whole time. I guess here is where I should mention that I'm about 5'7 and 130 pounds and this kid is about 6'0 and 200 pounds. Needless to say he's got some size on me. So I've loosened the choke, but I'm still holding it firm but not squeezing at all. The kids starts grabbing my hair and just pulling the crap out of it. The girls are still yelling that I'm gonna kill this kid. So I start arguing with them, telling them he's gonna run if I let him go. They keep screaming at me. Fine. I let go, and hold firm around his waist. He stands up and starts dragging me, while standing, trying to run away. I implore any bystanders to help, and these two big-ish guys help me hold him there.

Finally, an employee of the college shows up and informs us that the police are on their way, but he can't touch the kid. So this kid is still dragging the 3 of us around and we're trying to hold him. Finally, we agree that we'll put him on the ground. So we ground the kid and he just starts unloading punches at me, mostly top of the head, but some hit me in the jaw (which is now sore and slightly swollen). College employee jumps in and helps us hold him down til police get there.

They take, my, my girlfriend's and some other witness statements. At this point I hear a bystander mention that they know the kid and he's mentally ill. Crap, I should have realized earlier. Now the police pull me aside and start grilling me, asking me if I thought the kid was an imminent threat to me and actively trying to harm me. I point to the fact that he punched me in the head several times. Then the officer informs me that I could be arrested for applying "deadly force" in the form of the choke, which is a felony. Pshhh, I tell him, that's complete BS, dude tried to rob me.

So it ends with me telling the police that yes I'd like to press charges for assault and attempted robbery. And the police informing me that they will contact me and the kid may try to press assault charges on me. By the way, before someone complains, I'm only pressing charges because clearly this kid is either off his meds or on the wrong ones and they need to be adjusted. If his doctor informs me that they have fixed the medication and he is indeed taking them, and I get an apology from the kid, I will gladly drop the charges against him.

**tl;dr: Kid tries to rob me, I choke him, he punches me, whoops he's mentally ill, cops come and tell me I might be arrested for a felony in the near future; ALL LEGAL ADVICE WELCOME** 




 On my last paper I got a bad grade because my grammar was bad. Would anyone be willing to proofread my paper for mistakes?

Here is the paper:

Jeg s det program hedder Horisont: Liv og dd. Det var i fjernsynet p sndag, klokken 21:55. Det er 24 minutter langt.

Filmen handler om abort i Irland. Demonstranter der gr ind for abort er vist. Nogle kvinder er vist, som gr ind for valg. De nsker abort rettigheder, fordi der nu er ingen rettigheder for de kvinder til abort. Der er kun rettigheder for fosteret. Reporter interviewer en mand. Manden siger, at hans kone havde graviditet komplikationer. Manden siger, at lgen fortalt ham graviditeten var en spontan abort. S en lge interviewes hvem siger, at irsk lov siger, at lgen ikke kan abort et foster, hvis mors liv ikke er i fare. S interviewe manden, der siger deres lge fortalte ham, at de ikke kan abort fosteret, fordi det er live.

Reporter interviewer en kvinde, der er en anti-abort demonstrant. Kvinden mener deres protester beskytte ufdte fostre. Et fjernsyn interview er vist med republikansk senator Todd Akin. Senatoren siger, at han tror, hvis en kvinde er voldtaget, hendes krop vil aborterer fosteret.

Reporteren er vist interviewe en anonym irsk kvinde. Kvinden siger, at hun tog til England for at f en abort. Kvinden siger, at for hende turen var god.

Reporteren viser os et sted, hvor forldre, der ikke nsker deres brn kan opgive dem. Stedet har mange anti-abort plakater. Katolske nonner administrere stedet. Nonnerne stte brnene op til vedtagelse.

Et interview med en pro-choice kvinde vises. Hun siger, at regeringen i Irland gr love for abort og anti-abort love ogs. Regeringen fortstter med at forbyde abort, selv med mange protester mod abort love.
Lge Peter Boylan siger, at han tror Irland skulle debat abort nu. Han siger, at for 20 r siden, ville regeringen ikke lytte, men nu regeringen skal lytte.

Filmen slutter med at vise den mand, hvis kone dde, fordi lgen ngtede at gre en abort. Filmen er meget trist og flelsesmssige, og sger at ndre betragterens sind, hvis de er anti-abort.
 




 Just watching his interview (http://www.mmafighting.com/2012/12/5/3734168/rory-macdonald-plans-on-annihilating-hurting-and-destroying-b-j-penn) and the UFC on Fox 5 pre-fight press conference (http://www.mmafighting.com/2012/12/6/3732750/ufc-on-fox-5-press-conference-video) I can't help but get the feeling that Rory has the demeanor of Fedor except that Fedor actually smiles, and Rory is just... cold. I absolutely love his attitude and sincerely hopes he takes over at WW soon. 









 So I know it causes uninhibited growth which forms tumors, but how do the tumors kill you? Do they get large enough to block blood flow or what? 




 The limit represents the derivative of some function f at some number a. State such an f and a.

lim as h approaches 0  (fourth root(16 + h) - 2)/h



My answer: I got that a is 2, but I can't for the life of me get f. 




 So my internet is fine for everything but videos. On youtube, you know how it loads only the next 30 seconds until you press play, then continues loading? Well over that entire 30 seconds it maybe loads another 5 seconds, so I have to watch that 35 seconds, then sit there for another 2 minutes while it loads the next 30 seconds.

As you can imagine this gets pretty painful. But the kicker is I know its only my computer. My roommate's laptop loads the exact same videos fine with no pauses and we are both getting wireless off the same router.

So maybe, just maybe someone knows some easy fix to make my internet go faster or how to make youtube load the whole videos?

Additional info: I have Webroot and Malwarebytes and they both run clean scans so I'm pretty sure its not spyware slowing it down.

Edit: I'm on a Toshiba Satellite A305 laptop and am running Windows Vista if that helps anything

Thanks so much in advance for your help! 




 And I don't mean the historical explanation. I mean the "hey that actually makes sense" explanation. Seriously, our 12 hour blocks go from 12,1,2...11 It just makes no sense to me. Like maybe if it went from 12,11,10,9...1 then ok I get it, it's going backwards, but this go 11 numbers back then start increasing by 1 thing makes no sense to me.

And no I'm not high, I just finished my college semester and have 3 weeks to sit around before Summer classes start so I've been contemplating a lot of boring things. 
























 And even then nothing changes, because Obama will just veto anything the Dems don't like. And the Repubs don't have majorities to override vetos. 




 If the GOP win the Senate, nothing changes.

Any bill passed by the House and Senate that Democrats disapprove of will be vetoed by Obama and nothing will change that because the GOP do not have 2/3 majorities in both houses, or even one house.

Gridlock before midterms and gridlock after. 




 Power is always the last thing to go. 




 Correct. The Circuit Court made a ruling that the ban was unconstitutional, then the Supreme Court denied the case, and a federal judge just ruled that Alaska must abide by the Circuit Court's ruling, which is what happened in this article. Gay marriage is legal in Alaska today. 




 The appeal already happened. The Supreme Court denied to take the case. This is it. Gay marriage is legal in Alaska today. 




 Yes, in this case. Here the Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the ban unconstitutional, and the Supreme Court chose not to take the case. All that had to happen was a federal judge rule that Alaska must abide by the Circuit Court's ruling, which is exactly what happened here. Today, gay people can marry in Alaska. 




 Are you saying the Tennessee Constitution would have an amendment banning abortion?

Because if it passed, it would make absolutely no difference. Each state answers to the Supreme Court and since they ruled abortion is legal, it is for every state unless a US Constitutional amendment bans it or the Court reverses itself. 




 OMG, that's what the movie's gonna be about, him finding his sister! 




 See this is where you call the cops and paramedics who should contact CPS. 




 Find an Arizona lawyer here: http://www.azbar.org/FindALawyer

Call up as many as you can and see if they'll take the case, but accept payment from any settlement/award you'll get from the landlord at a later date. The lawyer will decide if it seems like enough of a winnable case that they would risk that. 




 I would look into a lawyer if I were you. It's possible they need to repay you for the excess in electricity you've been paying for. 




 I'm just curious what GORPS means. 




 Napalmenator is. I directly asked him if he would subject his child to a situation in which he believed his child was being physically or sexually abused if the court ordered him to do so and he answered he would, by saying he would not violate a custody agreement.

I have made my point clear on what I would do and I stand by it: contact the police immediately and not let her son go over there in the meantime. I don't think any rationale parent in the world would subject their child to physical or sexual abuse just because of a custody agreement.

To pose the same question to you: Would you send your child into an environment you suspect they are being physically or sexually abused in, if there was a court that ordered you to do so? 




 What a cop out line.

So explain how a parent who purposefully places their child in a situation they suspect subjects that child to physical or sexual abuse is anything other than a bad parent. 




 That would make you an extremely bad parent. Some things are more important than the law. 




 As you should note then, I recommended she contact police immediately. In spite of all the things you mentioned, you did not answer the question. 




 I disagree. Would you send your child into an environment you suspect they are being physically or sexually abused in if there was a court that ordered you to do so? 




 I'm merely refuting one point of law advice with that of common sense. 




 I would agree with point 2 if it were not predicated on point 1. 




 I just somehow really doubt any judge would look at all the facts here and come to that conclusion. 




 A very good point! 




 It's not. It's rooted in life experience and common sense. 




 I respectfully disagree with point 1. If she feels it is likely her son is being sexually or physically abused she would be a bad person, let alone parent, to let her son go over there. If I were her, I would call the police immediately and report everything. They will likely have the son seen by a court ordered psychiatrist who will evaluate him and recommend any further action. 




 Sorry I can't answer more but I can confirm that it is illegal for them to enter without notice or an emergency. I don't know what the damages are or about moving the camera. 




 It actually is physically addictive to some people. Usually only serious users. They go through withdrawals and everything.

 Fake boob dude 




 Thank you for answering! 




 I mean, if it's so obvious can you answer at least one or two of the questions? 




 Yea, like an hour ago. What am I missing? 




 I was thing the same thing about the tapes but it's possible she deleted everything before the last couple days and just insinuate he had the tapes overwrite every few days. 




 Someone help me here cause I know there's a few hidden things near the end.

How did Amy get pregnant? The sperm bank? When did she get pregnant?

What were Affleck and the sister planning at the end? Not to kill her, but... Also, what was with the several instances of twincest insinuations? Was there actually something going on? Was that why the sister got THAT mad when she found him banging slutbag when she already hated the wife and was jealousy the reason she hated the wife? Did they ever mention why she hated the wife?

Why did he feel so trapped with her at the end? Why not just leave? Why not try to record her? She was obviously getting careless when she said she killed for him and he was fully clothed and could have been wearing a wire.

What was the significance of the dementia dad? There must have been something. Why did Affleck only visit him once in a year he had been in the old people home?

What was the significance of the parents borrowing from her trust?

And last, how in the world did Amy find out that Affleck was banging this girl in the fathers house, in the woodshed, etc.? 




 Awaiting the eventual comment you're all thinking. 




 Assuming their striking is equal, I assume the wrestler would go for a TD if he has no advantage on the feet, then the BJJ guy would sub him since the wrestler doesn't know any BJJ, no? 




 What kind of symptoms do you still have? 




 I guess the period was the FG in that case? 




 A touchdown for every letter in RELAX. 




 I mean four losses is the end for anybody though. How many people with four losses have they kept around for another fight? I can only think of Hardy, and that was b/c one was to GSP. 




 Dude's got the gift. If MM goes out and they need someone to fill his place ala PSH style, they know who to call. 




 Am I the only one who enjoys being called on and attempts to participate each class? Granted I'm a 1L so I have no idea if this is gonna fade over the next few years. 




 NO. Absolutely do not talk to the police anymore without a lawyer under any circumstances. 




 Ok, so purely from a financial standpoint, this is stupid. HOWEVER, it depends how much this is worth it to you intrinsically.

From a loans standpoint, you're decent. Your $30K in loans at 0% interest is about equal to $21.5K in loans if they were at 7% interest, a pretty standard rate, for the standard 10 year repayment period.

So if I were you, I'd figure out if your total loans after studying abroad, equal to $30K at 0% and $20K at 7%, are going to be in excess of 10% of your salary after graduating and getting a job. I calculated that you'd need to pay about $5700 a year in loans to pay them all back in 10 years, meaning if your expected salary upon graduation is above $57,000 then go for it, and if not don't. 




 Personally for me that would be close of a margin. Can you tough it out for another year? In general, with more job experience you will have an increase in salary and that might allow you to float by longer if the house goes vacant. Additionally, you can save an extra "vacancy fund" in this year's time. 




 Oh I completely agree. I just think everyone should be given some sort of due process, even if it is just a hearing. But that is just my opinion and has no effect on what is "right." Like you said, the NFL is a private corporation and can suspend anyone after an arrest. 




 I think the issue is very clear that AP did commit the abuse. He hasn't denied that in the least. You don't always have to let the justice system play out, if guilt or innocence is excessively obvious.

HOWEVER, I believe that everyone should be given due process. What this does not mean is that their due process must come from the govt directly. But a small hearing with impartial judges deciding AP's fate after hearing all of the evidence available? Yea, I think they'd be fine suspending him after that. Do you agree? 




 Shamrock had almost zero BJJ experience. My argument was both for someone smaller and with a moderate amount of experience. 




 I'm making a pretty mild claim here: that someone moderately athletic but with a massive size advantage could take down and punch someone with extremely limited grappling experience. 




 Oh I completely agree. 




 I'm talking hypothetically based on the dudes comment that untrained guys cannot beat champions. 




 Even an athletic 250 pound dude taking on a 125 pound champ?

There's a limit somewhere. 




 Dude 50's got at least 60 pounds on the dude and could probably get him down to the ground if he just charged at him. I think it'd be at least a semi-interesting fight. 




 So whichever of the three concurring opinions has the most senior justice is the majority?

Also your link does not work. 




 I'm not an expert but...

Although my below posted link does not explicitly say the residents did not receive money, it is heavily implied by the fact they were viewed as second class citizens who were wild.

http://history.howstuffworks.com/revolutionary-war/louisiana-purchase3.htm 




 I agree but you can't say you may want to pursue an action at a later time and at the same time turn down a police report on the matter. 




 Say there are 3 concurring opinions (with 2 justices each) and a dissent with 3 justices (and say the CJ is in the dissent). Which opinion become majority? 




 More than that, when he said that the driver offered to call the cops instead so they could make a ruling on the case and he goes "oh no, I don't talk to cops." Really dude? You don't get it both ways. 




 Ok your options seem to be: 1) drop out 2) go talk to your school's financial aid office and see if by some miracle they have a program that will help you 3) apply for private loans immediately and get your parents on as co-signers if you do not qualify by yourself 




 I don't think they are requiring that the jurors have no prior knowledge of the case or they would have moved jurisdictions already. 




 I'm by no means an expert in the subject but I'll try to answer. The number of deaths from 9/11 is massively higher than the vast majority of terrorist attacks. Just to give you a statistic, in 50% of all suicide terrorist attacks, the only person that dies is the suicide terrorist themselves. Not to mention that 9/11 was the mark of an absolute explosion in suicide terrorism across the world. If you were to look at a chart, you would see the number of deaths resulting from suicide attacks drastically increases in the following years. It's also just a marker that life as we knew it was over. Between the PATRIOT Act, increased airport security, and the creation of a new Dept of Homeland Security it just changed so much about our way of life. 




 I'm honestly not sure. Like I said, I didn't actually CAP, just went to UTSA, looked at what CAP required (I think a 3.2), figured as long as I had at least a 3.5 they wouldn't say no, then filled out another app for UT and got in.

Maybe someone else will know the answer. You can always post again on here, people are pretty nice about the whole thing since we were all in your shoes pretty recently. 




 Hey just to give you some hope, my SAT score was horrendous, like way below yours. I hadn't studied or taken school seriously at all in highschool, and I wasn't in the top half of my class, rank wise.

I didn't do CAP, but I did a year at UTSA and it was the easiest thing in the world. I made A's in all 10 classes including Fall and Spring then transferred to UT and actually just graduated (finished all my classes in July). And UT isn't exceptionally hard either. I can count on one hand the number of classes I didn't make A's in while there. Granted, I studied my ass off my entire time at both UTSA and UT. I say all this not to brag, and really hope it doesn't come off that way, but just to let you know it's not that bad to spend a year somewhere else and it's totally do-able. Good luck and let me know if you have any questions. 




 Wait are you the guy in question? I'm on mobile and the 'in context' doesn't go back far enough for me to see. 




 Ok, I'm not disputing that its taboo to have sex with someone besides a spouse.

The ONLY point I'm making is that a cheater (someone who has sex with someone besides their SO without their SO's permission) is a terrible person, in my opinion. 




 You don't have to. Nobody has to.

I'm judgmental because cheating destroys lives and is a horrible thing.

Are you judgmental on anything? Murder? Rape? Kidnapping? We all judge things we deem morally deplorable. Nobody is required to live up to another person's morality, but must suffer the consequences of their actions. One of the consequences of cheating is I will find you a terrible person. 




 It's highly implied that the spouses are not ok with it in the original posts. I think either one of them would have said so if their SO's were aware.

But if their spouses are ok with it, then nothing is wrong and they aren't scumbags. I stated this a couple replies up. 




 Those are not reasons why cheating on a spouse is legitimate. MANY things are more important than sex in a relationship. But a child growing up in a house where a parent has so little respect for their spouse that they cheat on them does not set a good example for that child. Do you disagree? 




 I see that and agree. But there's plenty in here that is just consensual stuff going on, whereas this is non-consensual to their SO's. The cheaters should not be encouraged, in my opinion. 




 There are no legitimate reasons, therefore it makes the person a shitty person no matter what.

What you're saying is tantamount to someone admitting to killing their 5 year old child in a gleeful manner (which is the attitude this guy and girl gave off bragging of their cheating) and you saying you'll "wait to hear all the facts." A reasonable person can conclude that its not necessary to hear much more, and if there was a justification, the people would have said it. 




 Give me a legitimate reason on why someone cannot/won't leave their SO.

What else would they do? LEAVE THEIR SO. That is the alternative to cheating.

I am commenting on what a reasonable person could take from the post, that they are having sex with other people, without the permission of their SO. It seems a reasonable person would take those to be the substantial facts here.

 




 I'm pointing out that their SO's don't know the cheating is going on. If you're cheating on someone, it makes you a shitty person. Leave the person if you really can't stop yourself from sleeping with someone else. 




 This makes you and her both pretty terrible people, assuming both if your SO's don't know. 




 Appreciate the support. 




 I never said the case was clear. I merely said it was not alleged, it was a matter of fact. The United States court system allows for an allegation to become fact upon conviction by a jury of your peers. That is an indisputable fact.

Edit: Just for fun, I'll comment along with you. You didn't give context and I haven't read the interview, but I'll assume the quotations are from Tyson.

Point 1: Tyson says he did less time b/c the judge did not believe he committed the crime. This is where I introduce the concept that correlation=/=causation. Just b/c he was given less time than others does not equate to the fact that the judge believed he was not guilty. There were several other mitigating circumstances, such as the fact that some of the evidence was not as strong, or the fact that he had no prior felonies. Further, a Court of Appeals certified that the evidence was strong enough that he should not even be granted a retrial. If he really thought people believed he did not commit the crime, then why didn't the Court of Appeals vacate his conviction or at the very least give him a new trial?

Point 2: Tyson says that just b/c she falsely claimed she was raped once, she should never have put herself in that position. What position? The position of having entering a hotel room? The position of hanging out with someone you don't know alone? Any of these contentions are absolutely ridiculous and have no bearing on proof of his guilt or innocence and the very fact that he made these contentions is insulting to all rape victims. 




 No but it's ruling is taken as fact. 




 Hey just a note, but it's not an "alleged" rape. He was convicted by a jury of his peers. He is for all intents and purposes guilty of rape and therefore it is treated as a matter of fact, not allegation.

Edit: LOL to all the haters. Feel free to downvote me. It's a matter of fact that upon conviction by a jury of your peers, an allegation is seen by fact for all intents and purposes. If you wanna hate on me for stating a something that is unilaterally true, at least have the decency to comment with a reason.

Edit 2: Goddamn you guys are just a bunch of whiners about this. I point out one factually relevant point about a post and you guys fly off your hinges. I always assumed my fellow /r/MMA-ers were a cool bunch of folks, but I have been proven otherwise. Have fun debating others about how facts don't apply to you bunch. 




 Contact the police in the meantime and have record of ownership (vet records, if your dog is chipped, adoption records, etc.). You will get your dog back immediately.

In the meantime the guy can sue you for $1000, which I would guess you MIGHT be obligated to pay, but not anything above that as any judge will find that $1000 is a reasonable reward.

If you don't know where the guy lives who has your dog, I would set up a fake meeting, telling him you have the $1500 then call the police once he shows up unwilling to give you the dog, and follow him if he leaves the meeting spot while maintaining contact with police. 




 As the other guy said, implied consent.

Here's a hypo:
Man in car crash. Man loses consciousness and suffers severe lacerations. Emergency medical workers show up and treat the lacerations. Man regains consciousness. Man refuses ambulance ride after stabilized and walks home.

Do you think the man would not be required by a court to pay for his treatment?

 Anderson Silva was probably the GOAT at one point between Fedor and Jon Jones. 




 Should've been a no contest like the Maynard fight where he knocked himself out in the slam. 




 No judge will count the cost of wood flooring under a carpet and padding as ruined by cat pee. If I were you I would tell her she has no evidence of ruining the wood and it is unreasonable for her to count it in your damages.

In most cases, you are required to give 30 days notice, even after a lease runs out. You will automatically revert to a month to month tenant with no lease and this is one of the requirements. You're saying you gave her 26 days notice? I am not a lawyer, and you should consult one for an answer, but I would think you would only have to reimburse those four days so for example if your rent was $500 then you would have to reimburse 500*(4/30)= $66.67

I would consult a lawyer for advice on these issues if I were you but ultimately take her to small claims court without a lawyer. In many states you can sue for 2-3 times the money that is rightfully yours. 




 So the carpet wasn't new when you moved in. She is entitled to charge you proportionally for the life expectancy of the carpet for the damage you did. Say life expectancy was 10 years and carpet cost $500. If it was 5 years old, and the cat pee ruined it then you owe $250.

If I were you, I would let her know that you know you are aware that you only owe for the life expectancy you prematurely ended. You ask her to produce a receipt or official record of when the carpet was purchased, what the cost was, and what the life expectancy was. If she refuses and continues to pursue further you take her to small claims court. 




  I'm not a lawyer, but I am in law school and studied several cases taught by law school professors in undergrad. And something I've learned is that if a reasonable person can imply something then it has at least some consideration. Here, the landlord could reasonably conclude that she had leased the property for a minimum of one year. That is why I came to my conclusion. 




  she basically said that even if she filled the apartment, she would continue to charge us until December due to inconvenience.

This is generally illegal. I do not specifically know the laws of your state, but in general you can only sue for ACTUAL damages. If she is not losing any money, she will not win any damages.
 




 If she has emails of you implying you know your lease is for a year, then you should be prepared to lose in court. I am not giving you binding legal advice, but absent of any other major factors, this seems like a 50/50 case.

Have you looked into subleasing? You should be able to find someone to sublease your place for a couple months and usually around the same rent you are paying as that is most likely near the market rate. Also, be sure to check your lease on the legalities of it. But even if it is against your lease, your landlord may be willing to make an exception (GET IT IN WRITING IF SHE DOES) because she most likely wants to avoid a big legal headache as much as you do. 




 Not the same thing. 




 I guess we just look at the concept differently, which is completely ok. To me, a situation is either just or not whereas it seems you are viewing it on an individual level.

To expand on my main post, I feel that if we condone this behavior in any way, i.e. calling it just for one party, then that is going to encourage others in similar situations, resulting in a VERY slippery slope. 




 The fact of the matter is, in this case yes the guilt was kind of clear, and many will argue the punishment fit. But if you allow vigilante justice, you screw the whole system.

What about a guy that's "pretty sure" someone else killed his dog? Can he go destroy that guy's car? What about a case like this, but the driver were not drunk, and merely hit a pothole causing the car to swerve and kill these two kids? Would he deserve to die in that case?

At the end of the day, we as a society have agreed that anyone, guilty or innocent, deserve their day in court before they are punished. The driver in this case was deprived of that. For me, that is injustice. 




 Fair point. But that doesn't matter. Walmart will pay out the ass before this goes to trial and if they don't a jury will still find that the Loss Prevention guys clearly went above what was reasonable in hitting him in the face once he was on the ground. 




 Classic case of jury nullification. I read another article with more/different details.

Basically the guy was pushing his car (ran out of gas) with his two sons in what was basically the middle of nowhere, but still near this guy's house. Drunk driver plows into sons and kills them. Then drunk driver is shot to death almost immediately. They are 100 yards from guy who just had his son's died house. The ammunition the drunk driver was shot with matches ammunition that was found in guy's house.

Defense's argument was someone else randomly came and shot the drunk driver. Small town jury felt sorry for the man and acquitted in face of obvious beyond a reasonable doubt evidence. Due to double jeopardy the man will never be found guilty. Justice? You decide.  




 Unfortunately that dude is gonna have a LARGE payout. Walmart employee caught on video battering an unarmed man already on the ground? That's a 6 figure payout. 




 Why would you ask that? Are you a bloodist? 




 Dominick Cruz will be champ within the next year.

 Literally. 




 You are definitely going to want to contact a real estate lawyer about this. They will let you know if you need to be on the contract as well as help you write up an agreement regarding ownership. 




 Wrong. In many states the age of consent is 16. I think it's 14 in Hawaii.

 Well that's that. It is his building. 




 Hey I know this isn't a budget post, but just some rough advice. If I were you, I'd consider one of two options:

1) Move in with parents if they have room and allow it and put ALL available money towards the loans. Even if you are only making minimum wage, at 40 hours a week (and if your job isn't full time, get a second one), you should be earning $1100 after taxes per month. Live like a pauper on $200, and pay $900 a month towards the loans. Do this as long as you can.

2) Pick up and move to the oil fields in the Midwest or Texas, or go work on a fishing boat in Alaska. Yes it will suck and it's dangerous, but you'll clear $100K a year and have the loans paid back in 2 years. 




 Curiosity compels me to ask what exactly do you do as an independent contractor and how you were able to grow your income so fast. 




 What state, if you don't mind? 




 While I agree with the advice, there's almost zero possibility this person will agree to meet at a police station and suggesting so may spook them so that OP will never get the car back.

Why not meet in the store parking lot with a guy friend? 




 Red's Saloon. I just moved here too and its my go to Packer bar. 




 Just moved to San Diego in July and that's the bar I go to! (Although I didn't make it out tonight, so I'm not in the picture.) 




 No problemo! Glad to spread the knowledge! I was an econ major and did plenty of statistics studies in undergrad, so I can see it from your view. 




 I was hoping someone would catch that. 




 I'm betting you paid with a credit card, no? You can always do a chargeback with the CC company.

If I were you, I'd politely request a refund, minus some money for the work they have done already, and if they refuse do a chargeback, then negotiate with them for the amount of work done already. 




 Well my opinion is that that fact is mind blowing. 




 Wrong. Quoting from the article: "The fixed ratio of AS/H in our population was 1.02 for males versus 1.01 for females."

AS/H means arm span to height ratio. The ratios are virtually identically.

Here's your peer reviewed source written by Phd's in the field: http://m.erj.ersjournals.com/content/37/1/157.full 




 But they are heavily correlated and the average person has a wingspan equal to their height. 




 That just sucks so much for him. From Romil's point of view he spent 21 years completely alone just to die a couple hours later. 




 Yea. Here's the thing, this movie was what, 100-200 years in the future? I'll grant them that they have an artificial uterus that can house the eggs until birth, but then what? Anne Hathaway and the robot have take care for hundreds of babies? I mean even if that robot is 100% about the babies all day long, doesn't the ship only contain a few years worth of food? So Hathaway has to farmer the crap out of the planet for her and 500 other mouths and simultaneously raise all these babies into at least 10 year olds until they can start contributing. I don't envy the task. 




 Saw a theory in these comments that said something like: it was an alternate timeline where humans survived the first time around, but decided to set it up where this timeline's humans survived most likely b/c it is a better existence than theirs. It stands to reason that if the future humans could control the 5th dimension, they could control the alternate timeline.

It's not perfect logic, but it works for me. 




 Neither. They said in the movie that "them" was humans far, far in the future, like hundreds of thousands of years, that had evolved into being able to control the 5th dimension. 




 Marcus' reach is 4" longer, but he's 3" shorter. Weird. 




 Is THIS what's going on?

I raise my hand to ask and answer questions at least twice a class, and some people just seem to hate me. I've played on IM sports teams with different groups at my law school and people seem friendly to me on the team and I get along with people in small groups, but I'm never invited to any group study sessions and nobody wants to work with me on the group research project. 




 The wording is a little weird, but they mean the unemployment rate in terms of full time, JD required jobs is above 20% for all but 20/200 schools. 




 I'm with you. What percentage of the population is open to torturing a child to death? 0.1%? I mean seriously, what are the odds they got together? Insanely low. 




 This. OP's parents should spend a couple hundred dollars to verify this with a lawyer who deals with international law issues on a personal level. 




 Next time just say "I had a very large soda for lunch, please excuse me for a minute" and go to the bathroom. 




 This prompted me to look at other terrible games.

I found Kim McQuilken, who went 5/26 with 43 yards, 0 TDs and 5 Ints. How the hell does he not get pulled earlier?! 




 That seems to be the consensus between other posters. Because if Romilly had gotten the robot properly working, he would have realized a all the supposed resources the planet had were nonexistent. 




 I too hated the paradox of future self giving info to past self causing him to become future self and it is the one thing I noticed in the film as someone with a modest to low knowledge of theoretical physics that just doesn't jive with any part of sound theory.

For the embryos part, I assumed they were scientifically advanced enough where they had artificial wombs to birth the children. Although it would still be a massive pain in the ass to care for all those babies. 




 Out of those movies , I have only seen Cloud Atlas so I can't speak to the others. In my opinion, Interstellar had the perfect recipe of tiptoeing just on the line of unbelievableness without crossing that line. I've yet to see a movie that placed itself above Interstellar in that respect. 




 It has a 71% rating mean that roughly 3/10 reviews say it is a bad movie overall. That fact is almost more mind blowing than the movie itself. 




 No way. I've seen all those and they don't compare at all. This too science fiction elements of several different kinds and blended them into a tale that stretches across about 90 years with significant portions at different points along the way. Further, it expands with physics to a point jusssst on the edge of unbelievable but theoretically sound enough for the average person. 




 That's just his Texas twang for ya 




 As a former Realtor, it is absolutely LAUGHABLE that any reputable company, let alone a bank, would use Zillow to calculate a home's value. Zillow is damn near worthless for accurate home values.
 




 You're right. It's tens of thousands of people who voted the exact way he described! 




 I misspoke. It can't be enforced below minimum wage. 




 They can't go below federal minimum wage. 




 And maters gonna mate 




 Or make election "day" 2 days long and everyone who works day 1 is not allowed to work day 2 and vice-versa. 




 I honestly believe he'd rather be playing. Do you not? 




 Ok. They willfully intoxicating themselves knowing it would vastly increase their risk of killing someone. 




 Completely agree with you. When someone beats their kid that bad and just doesn't see it as wrong, I feel like it is extremely hard to get them to turn their views around. I don't believe anything less than a couple years could make someone feel genuine remorse, especially not missing a few weeks of football.
 




 I mean it's only child abuse, right? 




 People that drive drunk don't intend to hurt anyone, but sometimes they kill people. Apply the same logic. 




 Here's a fun comic on entrapment. Kinda long, but you'll know entrapment pretty well if you make it to the end.

http://thecriminallawyer.tumblr.com/post/19810672629/12-i-was-entrapped 




 First file a claim with your insurance for the accident.

Second, do you have a lawyer helping with the lawsuit? If so, he can probably best answer your question. If not, just be honest in court and tell them everything. 




 If they haven't been paying their loan for 2 years, then this isn't "out of nowhere." In fact, that's about the longest a bank will go without payment before starting foreclosure proceedings.

In short, they've been duped by this "negotiator." While he may help some people, a bank WANTS people to pay the loan. They will help you go through modification to a certain extent, usually. Rarely, does a person need a negotiator to talk to the bank for them. If the bank wouldn't negotiate after a year of non-payment, it seems they would never negotiate, which is exactly what happened here.

Here's some food for thought. How long have they owned the home? More than 10 years? It's likely the bank would LOVE for the family to stop paying and foreclose on the house at that point. I'm gonna make up some numbers:
Lets say they bought the house for $100K, taking a loan for $90K
After 15 years, they only owe $60K
Meanwhile, the house is appreciating 4% per year and is now worth $180K

In that scenario, and the numbers in real life might be worse or better for your boyfriend's family, the bank would be able to sell the home and PROFIT $120K. They would be insane to renegotiate any loan when they could profit by letting the home go to foreclosure. I'm strongly suspecting something like that is what's taking place here, and is the reason the bank refuses to renegotiate.
 




 /u/hansSA is right. You need couples counseling. Here's the thing: you're in denial over your husband meeting a man for a gay relationship on match. That's understandable in this situation. What would never fly in any situation would be if I asked my SO to go to counseling because I perceived a problem in our relationship that I thought required professional help and my SO refused to go to counseling. Right then would be the time that I would look to get out of the relationship, because at that point I would know the person does not care about your feelings in the relationship.


Suggest couples counseling, and if he refuses, I would start looking for an out if I were you. 




 I would 100% mention that you do not live in the US and do not intend to return. That is the only leverage you have, because otherwise they will just wage garnish like they do with all the others. 




 

Since it is legal, and the original owner has no recourse, everyone should tweet/email/FB Spirit about how shitty they are for stealing this person's idea. 




 Thanks! 




 So I've read all the comments and I'm still not sure who the fighter is. 




 Oh gotcha. I see the argument both ways. Seems like the UFC and any other media need to define p4p next to the ranking. 




 Can you expand on your second definition? You just repeated "pound for pound." 




 "Yea, this will make us look real tough! Let's shove our fingers in their butts!"

I sincerely don't understand the logic sometimes. 




 Or repeat business if he just seals the cat in again! 




 Can you go to a therapist or perhaps have one come to you if you are unable to leave the house? You could do some therapy with the boyfriend and ultimately tell him with the therapist there. He would have someone to tell him "yes this is real and its not going to change" and also help him deal with his feelings on the matter. 




 Chael vs Vitor

I know people like to hate on Chael, but he's my guilty pleasure.

I thought he could wrestle Vitor and with it, I'm sure he would have gotten a title shot. I just want him to get the title he promised his dad he would get. (tear) 




 Could be any number of reasons. Maybe the suicidal man came to the window and pointed the gun at them and SWAT was outside the whole time. 




 Lots of times these kinds of waivers will not hold up in court. If there was a case of actual negligence you can still sue. 




 In bankruptcy, in most cases the court cannot take your house, or car. 




 They have been stripped of their firearms and are on suspension. It says it right in the article. It's standard procedure for any officer involved in a shooting. 




 I did that in middle school then they banned it. So I just had to be more sneaky ;) 




 Maybe it reflects upon them. But I would never assume the actions of an individual were with bad intentions merely because they belonged to a government organization where there had been stories of unlawful actions before.

You guys are literally assuming these guys are guilty until proven innocent. That's not how a society should operate. 




 Let's put you in that scenario. You're on the SWAT team that responded and the suicidal guy points a gun at you. Do you fire?

I would argue that any cop in that situation has "no choice" but to fire at the man. 




 The fact that you're referring to it's only what you've seen is the very definition of anecdotal evidence and therefore no air quotes are needed. 




 So you're going with the assumption that they are guilty until proven innocent, just to be clear? 




 I said "So are you just comfortable judging **this** SWAT team..." and you answered "Basically yeah..." and now you say "I wasn't specifying this SWAT team..."

You're backing out and spewing some good ol' fashioned cop hating, when all I'm doing is reiterating the point that none of us know the true facts and we shouldn't based our opinions of **this specific case** on a news report that doesn't give us the full story of what happened.

You have some good points, but your blanket hatred of all cops seem to have clouded your judgement. 




 These exact people on this SWAT team? 




 You don't know that these specific people on this SWAT team have done anything, unless you know something more than the rest of us. 




 Well I hope you never sit on a jury in that case. 




 I just don't understand how this is a rebuttal to Dolce. I think BJ had an off night and could have performed better. The fact that Dolce thinks he had amazing conditioning and was beating up the guys they brought in has nothing to do with that and why BJ blames Dolce for his loss blows my mind. 




 So are you just comfortable judging this SWAT team based on your preconceived notions with absolutely zero evidence? 




 Your story is nothing more than anecdotal evidence. It does not show it reflects the intentions of SWAT teams elsewhere.

Here, we don't have the full story. It is entirely possible the suicidal man got frustrated and aimed his gun at police who at that point would have no choice but to shoot him. Or its entirely possible something much like the scenario you described played out and they killed the guy on purpose. 




 I don't understand how people pick split decisions. Are you deciding the judges will suck? Or just that there will be a round that is a legitimate 100% toss up round?

If it's just close rounds then you'd pick the winner of the majority, no? 




 Aldo. Listen I'm not crazy, I know Aldo gasses. I know when he gasses he is susceptible to getting laid on (Hominick). I figure he'll stuff some TD's, maybe get taken down once or twice in the first two rounds but pop up soon enough where it doesn't count against him too much, and outstrike Mendes through the first 3 rounds to take them by a close margin, then get laid on for 4 and 5 but not finished from the bottom. 48-47 Aldo 




 I like how it took him 15 minutes to think of that last reply. Like he kept thinking of a follow up, but would erase it over and over thinking "no, that's not good enough" and THAT'S what he settled on?? 




 I'm not saying it's not possible but just be aware that there is a remote chance he was the beneficiary of a trust or his wife is or they won a small lottery, have a rich uncle or any other possibility. 




 Could the kid not wash it off themselves? 




 What was Rumble's deal? I remember Dana saying he was in danger of being permanently banned and I remember it was for what I thought was BS but I don't remember the specifics. 




 Before anybody bitches about it, the grammar in the title is correct. 









 I really thought that was going to end with "gay." Not that the premise would necessarily line up with the conclusion, but damn it just fits. 




 That ending. He was SO close to getting out. 




 It's quite possible he has a wealthy spouse or a trust fund or any number of other things. Just because someone's job has them making less money than they're spending does not always mean they are corrupt.

Have you considered that maybe since he's home by 2 every day that he's putting his time to good use and running a successful online business or something similar? 




 Wait, why? 




 Is this true? Can you cite a law, either Federal or state?

I just moved to California and nearly every single business here asks to see my ID when I pay with a credit card. 




 The first step would be talking to other employees and getting them to go with you to talk to a lawyer about the matter. Most likely, the other side will get audited by an independent accountant who will calculate the damages. 




 Of course, it's happening right now. China claims Taiwan, but many regulatory bodies recognize Taiwan as its own state and Taiwan did not win a war over China to gain independence. 




 Yep. 




 Thank you for taking the time to answer! 




 Disagree again. What if the UN and every other country in the world recognizes the new country but the host country refuses to go to war with the new country. In that case would you recognize that a Declaration would be a legal document? 




 I might be misunderstanding myfunnynamewastaken's question, but I think he's asking how one would know if they truly don't want to be an attorney whatsoever or if they're just having 1L blues. 




 Another 1L here: So does the lawyer for one side say the evidence is prima facie, then the other lawyer can rebut it and it's no longer prima facie? 




 What about nations that just declare their independence and do not go to war with their former host country? 




 ALL law was created at one point or another by its own institutions. You say emancipation is a legal process. The courts who made it a law gave itself that power. That is my argument for why the Declaration was a legal document.

Also, I never said anyone could reference the Declaration, only that  




 I guess we'll just have to disagree. I think one country formally declaring they are no longer part of another is inherently a legal procedure.

I would liken it to a minor declaring independence from a parent by emancipation, which I don't think you would disagree is a legal procedure. 




 My mistake on the source, however the Declaration most certainly is a legal document. It is breaking off connection from another country's rule. 




 Well I was just going by what the founding fathers defined as rights. 




 I completely disagree. Sweden doesn't have MORE of a right, they just have less chance of their right being taken away, an important distinction.

Nonetheless, for your Colorado example, the Constitution doesn't guarantee the degree of a right, only that there is that right. 




 Yes, there is a "right to life" even if we have the death penalty. I am arguing that the govt can validly take away rights. It's the user I was replying to that is arguing otherwise. 




 No, both are ok. I'm not arguing either is not ok. The power to veto is a check on power and is the very essence of our democracy, as is the power to filibuster. 




 Obama would never let that happen. He can manufacture a trillion dollar coin, simply order the debt payments continue as a matter of national security, or any number of other scenarios. Also the Republicans took a beating in the polls last time they pulled that stunt, and seem unlikely to try again.

Also, can you give me a source on him saying they would default if they won the Senate? I had not heard that. 




 No. How could it be? 




 Dana does, and he watches it the whole fight. You see it in a lot of his vlogs. 




 I guess the moral is, most challengers think you gotta have something extra up your sleeve if you wanna beat the best. 




 That's not true. There is a right to life, which can be taken away by the death penalty. There is a right to liberty, which can be taken away via a prison sentence. And there is a right to property, which can be taken away via seizure or eminent domain.

Were you thinking those weren't rights or that we shouldn't be able to have any of them taken away?
