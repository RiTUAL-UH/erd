 I posted the original 4 months ago, but here we are side by side.

 Its a good lesson for all our boys. Take it in stride and be humble...that's the attitude that got us our Smythe! 




 They hate us because we are a top house at our school. It's pretty funny. 




 We got a lot of positive feedback, even from our rival chapter! We still get the hate but, hell, with enough Yaks you might see a second video. 




 The reaction has been incredibly positive by all sorority women as well as our rival fraternity on campus! It's a good idea, just make sure it's executed well!   



















 Definitely a Blow Job shot...unless they're into that sort of thing. 




 No more farts!

 Find the rest of the trash can and then write about your experience. You can call it National Treasure 4 




 It's my honest belief that everyone is in some way, shape, or form a secret freak that needs a little bit of Jesus in their life. 




 Kill Bill! I've seen it maybe 20-30 times now.  









 When you're so excited about the movie and you watch it with your friends, but they have the most disinterested look on their faces.  




 Wow, I just read that comment too! 

I know everyone has a different situation, but I just came out to 160 of my fraternity brothers and was called, texted, and messaged from so many of them saying that they were proud of me and that they loved me!

The only advice I have for someone in the closet is to come out when you're ready, but don't take forever!

 




 Well, at least your Mom didn't use your laptop one day only to find that you didn't catch that hidden gay porn pop-up window that pushes itself to the back of all of your open windows.

That was a fun conversation. 

 




 Coming out of the closet.  




 Pizza is the circle of life.  




 We're into old ladies. 




 I've never seen Goonies and now I'm too afraid to even ask to watch it. 









 It actually bums me out that people are taking this negatively. Sheesh man she's just trying to support us, not drag us out of the closets.  




 Does anyone know who this man is of when this was taken? He looks like a regular that comes into my restaurant!  




 The perfect bathroom for...some people. 




 TIL that people on reddit have bad teeth. 




 I just wanna pick your cheeks 




 "Thank you officer, I feel refreshed." 




 Pizza...pizza dat ass. ;)

 "I feel okay about feeding my child McDonald's now, because books!" 




 This is so terrible, I'm tearing up.  




 I don't know how to do any of that 




 I lived with an Asian family the first semester that I transferred to my university. It was weird, so I decided to join a club so I could branch out and meet new people. Turns out that after the first semester, one of my club-mates asked me to move into his 5 bedroom house. Life was good after that.

Then I joined a fraternity and made like a million more friends. 




 My open palm. 




 I'm from Southern California and confused about all that white stuff on the ground behind you. 









 These are so annoying 




 I want to eat it. It looks like delicious marzipan candy. 









 I would sign a blood contract and pledge to you my first born.  




 Your parents are related. 









 You really couldn't walk a flight of stairs to go pee? You are so lazy! 




 Kill Bill: Instead of a story of revenge, it a really sadistic story about a man stalking his ex lover, killing all of her friends and family in order to find her and kill her.

Sounds more like a horror film than a kung-fu movie. 




 Its NYE and everyone in the office is pretending to work. 




 I fell in love and out of love and that gap in between is what I remember the most.  




 Whatever movie that made Nicholas Cage famous. 




 When you're pooping in a stall next to somebody.  




 Your taste in music.

I was in awe once the film ended and all of my friends hated it. They literally laughed the entire car ride home about how stupid it was, which almost ruined it for me.
