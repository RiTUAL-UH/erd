What started off as a project inspired by Shaco, eventually lead into a piece of music I used for a university performance. 
Feel free to throw it in your playlist for when you're play Shaco!  









 Hi, Foxdrop.
I'm a Shaco main, and seeing your opinion in the comments about how Shaco will receive an implied buff to his early counter jungling is very nice to see. 
My question is, what, in your opinion, would you say is the best jungle item to build for Shaco? At first glance I thought it would be the one that marks an enemy, but I'm not sure if that would break his stealth, which removes his crit damage. 





























 Thanks for the compliment :)
But what exactly do you mean by what you said? :) 














 Thank you!! :) 
























 Thanks mate :) 
And I think you have to go into the game's folders and replace the audio track for the menu screen 




 For any other Shaco mains who like listening to creepy carnival musics when they play Shaco, or just anyone who's interested in hearing music inspired by a League champion, I'd love it if you checked out my composition inspired by Shaco.
