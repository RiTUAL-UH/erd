 We just have the anatomy of raptors in our heads from what we suspected them to look like millions of years ago.  Over that time I'm sure they have been able to evolve enough to put their long claws up to their mouths in order to think. 




 Like a whole bag of dicks! 




 And after too many uses you had to find just the right sweet spot on the switch to make the RCA input work through it. 




 That's because it's still the best multiplayer system to date! 




 I usually try to use a self checkout anymore so i can cram as much into as few bags as possible.  But you're saying that by putting my items together like this when going to a person would avoid the bagger person from using 13 bags for 15 items? 




 Oddly I agree with you here.  When I was in college and used a computer lab, cleaning the roller was one of the things I usually did. 




 The Big Lebowski is a good one to do this to considering how many times you have to watch it to get everything. 




 I don't think the success kid would hit the wrong link in the first place. 




 Goddammit!!  I lost! 




 Heck, everyone knows you can drive 5 mph above the speed limit and still not get pulled over. 




 I absolutely hate it when someone stands there and holds the door when you're 50 feet away yet.  It makes you feel like you should go faster since they are holding the door, but at the same time it pisses you off because you can't walk at your normal lazy pace! 




 You'll read anything on the cue cards.  And I mean anything! 




 If we were living 100 years in the past, then we wouldn't be able to read shit like this on the internet! 




 I'd say it's worth the risk of jail if it's already been censored for everyone. 




 So is the guy on the left his translator then? (I'm aware it's not Jackie Chan, so that answer is not necessary) 




 It definitely beats drinking at the bar the entire night.  Especially when you're going to be with the same group of people regardless where you drink. 




 I wonder how many facebook friends God has? 




 Bi-force? 




 You are very strong willed if you can wait until Christmas for all 3 of those games! 




 Is the guy in the bottom left supposed to be Canadian? 




 Team America!  Fuck Yeah!! 




 That would be fun to randonly run up to a mime like that and act like you ran into something.  Probably would catch him a bit off guard. 




 It looks like a shoe according to Family Guy. 









 I hear ebay calling for this little gem! 




 This is so true!  And then you don't even have to clean the dishes when you're finished! 




 I think concept 2 looks the best. 




 Wait, Gamestop was allowed to sell another game aside from MW3 during the launch? 




 Better learn some Austin Powers driving moves in order to get out of that situation! 




 And once one light goes out, they ALL go out!! 




 When my parents buit their house (in 1992) the entryway closet is where he put the switch for the outside outlets.  Although, they still take the lights down each year. 




 Yes, I'd say I agree that the method "works" better when working on inanimate objects. 




 He must not be very big.  Her mouth isn't open very wide. 




 So cussing up a storm to try to get something fixed doesn't work?  I never would have thought that. 




 Totally agree with this.  I've given up on even thinking that I'll actually do something in the morning before work. 




 With the lighting it sorta makes it look like a cult waiting for the time of ascension. 




 So the princess is in another castle then? 




 Some day I will have my own DK Arcade machine! 




 I'd say definitely good job for a last minute costume! 




 I like how the Rep says they have a rule saying they do not do refunds on downloaded games.  Then immediately following that statement says they will refund you with credit and remove the downloaded game from your account. 




 But it's always better on the original system compared to a ROM! 




 But it's worth it when you kill someone in a shooting battle with your last bullet that you just loaded into the gun! 




 Sorry, I meant it was after the system first launched, as in the first 6 months to a year.  Not just the actual launch titles on the first day.  Later in its life the prices decreased overall though. 




 I recall most 3rd party games being $70 when the system launched and 1st party games being $60.  May have been a few that I saw that were $80 though.  And later in the systems life these went down to $60 and $50 for the most part. 




 Good costumes.  Although you're missing the best driver....Donkey Kong! 




 Couldn't they have at least made the game a color version? 




 Hmm, so that explains why people have to wait so long to get actual assistance for Battlefield 3 problems. 




 It must come with free controller converter cables that aren't visible in the picture. 




 Oh, I see what you did there! 




 Same here.  Someone wanted me to join so i did just to check it out.  What am I supposed to do, write the same exact stuff that I put on facebook for the same people to read? 




 Looks like they just wanted to use you as a test dummy to see what would happen beyond the corner. 




 I can't stand it when people do that either, even when they aren't my games.  I'm glad I trained my younger brothers years ago that games need to be put back in cases and regardless how mad you get, you shouldn't throw a controller on the ground.  Or else you may face a week of not being able to play.  Now a days the game collection is in great shape and everything still works like new! 




 Is your wife's name Sheryl by any chance? 




 Holy balls, that is sweet! 




 Looks pretty interesting.  A slightly different take on a game that actually might require some thinking. 




 That is 2 1/2 minutes of my life gone.  But I'd say it was worth it. 




 More like a double crime since you technically took 2 great games down! 




 When he said 64, he may have been referring to a Commodore 64.  Either way....fail! 




 Must be a pretty exciting game if they don't even want to use the chairs right behind them! 




 Hmm, I must say that after almost 2 decades of playing the game I never noticed a difference in speed with the coins.  Of course I always use DK Jr when I play, which would be a faster top speed than most of the others to begin with.  I might have to do some testing to see if there is a noticable difference with coins now. 




 Sorry, only TWO people can have the same joke.  You're the third unfortunately. 




 That seems like the most logical way to go about this. 




 You just made me lose The Game!
http://www.losethegame.com 




 You got me.  I guess you get your free punch on my arm. 




 Don't forget to wash your hands!  You wouldn't want those shit particles accidentally being posted onto reddit! 




 On the older versions of the game the blue shell goes after the person in first at the time it's fired.  On the Wii version it changes targets to who is in first when it gets up to the front of everyone. 




 I don't think the coins made you go faster if you had more.  The point of the coins was so when you got hit by another kart you didn't spin out.  Each hit would make you lose a coin and when you were out and got hit by another kart you would spin out. 
























 Looks like you forgot to list Steam in the pic. 














 Vendor: Can I help you sir?
Me: Yes, I'll take a Big Dick and a Fuck Cunt please.
Vendor: That'll be $2 please.
Me (thinking in mind): Why haven't I come here before for this stuff? 









 My brothers and I still play Wrestlemania 2000 over No Mercy.  For some reason that game just stuck with us better. 




 Looks, good, but I think it would be better if she would have dressed up as Samus! 




 I was looking for Leo walking in the background. 




 The Cubs actually win the world series in BTTF.  That's who you need to bet on in 2015. 














 So um, how did it taste when it was ready? 









 The best I've ever found that was thrown out was a PS3 controller.  It needed taken apart and cleaned up, but it works just fine! 




 Good lord it's the loch ness monster!! 




 I was thinking the same thing in regards to people saying it's a relatives first meme. 



















 Haha, good one! 









 I always hope for this to happen when I get a friend request out of nowhere.  Never does though. 









 So apparently black clothes was the choice for the picture.  Looks like Will didn't get the memo. 




 And that means a lot more coming at the end of the year as opposed to the beginning. 




 At least the comic doesn't tell them about the arrow to the knee.  That could ruin the entire game for someone! 









 She could probably get the abortion at Costco. 



















 Doc, I think we've hit 88 mph! 




 But since this is random just for the sole fact that Ellemeno pointed out that is should be random, does that make this random pic relevant? 




 That's a start! 









 I agree on overhand on being the correct way too.  But it can vary per person. 









 And here all these years I thought you were supposed to bend backwards when playing limbo. 




 Holy crap, I had to do a double take with the picture.  My parents have a setup almost identicle to this one.  Except, they actually did put up a christmas tree in a different spot. 



















 That selection looks about right. 




 Why would you stop in the first place if it's only going to make you mad that you have to wait on a person crossing the road?  And it was your own choice. 




 When I was in college cars would stop on a regular basis and they were the LAST car going by.  Doing this only made things take longer for me walking and the driver. 




 I lost mine about a year ago.  GGG kept the cash for himself as a reward, but was kind enough to return everything else at least. 




 Oh, I get it. [Filmsy](http://www.filmsy.com/) 




 And then goes to the bar! 




 You could hang out a lot in freshly stacked haystacks with people who need hay... 




 Although I have never seen or read any of the Harry Potter's, I still find this pretty amusing. 




 SIMPSONS DID IT....er wait, different episode. 




 I see what a person is doing when paying a homeless person like this.  But lets say someone paid a homeless person $5 just to do this.  To justify that money you would have to be gone for more than $5 worth of parking in that spot. 




 A ticket pulls in more money than an extra $.50 in a parking meter is probably the main reason. 




 Since a little over 10 years have passed already , you actually only have just a hair over 12 years left to wait.  That time will fly by! 




 Ah, I guess I missed the really small one above the plate before.  I'd say it's small anough it shouldn't count anyhow. 




 Watching 6 movies with only 5 screens.  Wizardry? 




 They're going to get neck cramps looking up like that the whole time. 




 So why is he questioning his answer yes? 




 Makes me think of Wrestlemania 2000 on the N64. The game came out in 1999, but it lets you input dates for when you win a belt back to something like 1955.

 




 6 months?  So did Easter get moved back, or Christmas moved up? 




 I believe the blu ray release that is coming out next year for the 30th anniversary is putting the guns back in again. 




 So no one washes their face with soap?  Because when you do that you're also cleaning your eyebrows in the process.  Unless I've been fooling myself this whole time. 




 So where do I place my order? 




 My plan was to buy the book from the store and use it until the last day for full refunds.  Then order the book through the library and use that copy for free the rest of the quarter. 




 Problem 4 on page 87 has been changed.  Because of that, wecan't use the previous version anymore. 




 I kind of feel like I have a connection with each of you just because I work at Ohio State!! 




 She must be an avid Portal player! 


































 [FALSE!](http://qkme.me/3p6rjm) 




 Wha...what's the point of taking all the time to make this when you're just going to eat it a few hours later? 














 Only 303 views of the video as of me writing this, but 555 comments on here?  So apparently only a few people on reddit even watch the video before commenting on it? 




 "How does a human notice that" - Wouldn't it seem more natural to say person instead of human?  Or is the comment from some alien race? 




 There was a time lapse video on yahoo this past week showing the entire progress of the tower.  It was pretty cool to watch. 














 Should have used obtuse instead of stupid. 




 It's a rug, not carpet. 




 Purchase bullets for each shot made in game. 




 My co workers are this way.  It's impossible to get a sentence in as a response. 









 I was referencing one on the advice animals front page using cats that I know has been used before.  As I'm sure mine has been used before too. 









 My brothers and I wonder what we're going to do with our title belts after 2049 for Wrestlemania.  That's as far as the pre programmed dates go. 




 And Miners Cave for me! 









 So who else looked real close to find the one country that said something other than "people"? 









 So you are showing her that prayer actually does work? 




 I loved the original game, but unfortunately never played through it all.  The time and amount of load screens was unbearable.  I would love a remake it that was taken care of! 




 But why did you each make a full sandwich on your own and then put it on the earth?  You should have each just used 1 piece of bread with toppings on one side and put that on the ground. 




 Or a homeless man just looking for a good location to be a 4G hotspot
FTFY 




 a brief history of [Playstation controllers](http://imgur.com/1GHkf). 




 I was always aware that running at an angle was faster, but how do you know the speed difference as being 1.41? 




 I beat him this way as well since I didn't know about the controller port change. 




 One could only hope that is what his activities involve. 









 Good luck making that cash.  That comes out to 62.5 smudges you'd have to average per minute.  so roughly one per second. 




 Sorry, I don't watch the show myself, so I'm not sure what websites might have it posted for you to watch. 




 Now if you use this at work, is there a way it can block your internet browsing activity from the company too? 




 New episode this coming Wednesday after the new South Park actually. 









 Looks like OP spelled Taco Bell wrong. 




 Had the same thing when I was younger.  Now I've got the dvd in place of it. 




 I know it's no building, but an [elevator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator) is a start. 




 Repost, of course. 




 I have never worked at a small local pizza place, but I agree with you.  I grew up in NW Ohio where all the towns were small (~1,200 people) and the price of pizza is around what you are saying. 




 So was OP sitting in a shopping cart also when taking the bottom picture? 









 He doesn't look very happy.  Must have to go to work for the day. 




 Why did that show ever have to end? 




 TMNT - Turtles in Time 




 Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo 




 Donkey Kong Country Returns 




 Did you say [2-ply toilet paper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EE01Sbb8CU)?  It's at the very end, just wait for it. 




 True, the opening sequence would show it before each episode, but we were thinking in the actual show. 




 My brother and I were wathcing an episodes of King of the Hill last night and he brought up the fact that he couldn't think of a single episode where there wasn't at least one alcoholic beverage (usually beers in the alley) drank.  He's more of a fan than I am of the show, but I was trying to think of one as well and could come up with an episode.  Anyone know if there is a way to verify something like this? 




 Mario Kart 64 









 Just start clicking and eventually you find your way to safety at the end and everything is finally explained about what happened. 














 If Midway's building was on fire, this would make sense to all of us. 









 Read this on my phone and kept rotating it to read easier. The damn meme kept rotating with the screen and I couldn't win! 














 Exact same thing I was thinking. 




 Michigan....sorry to hear that. 




 You mean the long long ago. 




 Everyone has to start at the bottom!
