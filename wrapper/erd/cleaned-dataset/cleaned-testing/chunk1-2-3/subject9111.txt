 That's hecka creepy. Imagine if someone hacked into a nanny cam along with the monitor. They could watch you and talk to you but you would have no freakin idea who/where/why. 
























 That would be horrifying, but at least there is plenty of evidence. Also, a basic drawing or blueprint of your floor would help greatly. 
























 Ugh, this is too real. I sleep on an air mattress with only a snuggie for a blanket. So I'm low to the ground and barely covered, and the other night I woke up at like 2am and my blanket was hanging over the back of my desk chair. Long story short I was very cold for the rest of the night.
