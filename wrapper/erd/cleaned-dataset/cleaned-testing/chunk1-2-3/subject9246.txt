 Mine generally have to be in omelet form. Scrambled is a weird texture, and if the yolk and whites are separate, I can't stand the taste. Mushroom, tomato, onion, pepper, and cheese omelet is my favorite. 

As a kid and even a teen, I hated beans, but since becoming vegetarian I have tried them again and opened up to them. 

Ice cream is obviously delicious, but milk has always been my beverage of choice. 

I looked for my main nutrition book to see if I could find any more information, but it's back at my parents' place. When I go home for thanksgiving I'll see if it has anything else to say about it and if it has anything about nutrition and depression. 

Where are you looking to attend and what do you want to major in? Anything science tends to do that until enough information, research, and studies are available to come to a definite conclusion. In all of my classes I have been taught omega 3 is beneficial. 

Me too, I just searched my schools courses to see if any went over nutrition and depression/anxiety, but I wasn't able to find anything.

I've started searching online for local psychiatrists/therapists, and it is slightly overwhelming.  

Respecting my likes and dislikes is something I need to work on. I don't mind going to the bar and being social, but I'm kind of past the drunken college party scene. 

I know you said changing your diet helped, but are you also currently taking any medication or seeking counseling? (I apologize if you've already covered this, I'm on my phone and I'm not sure how to see previous posts while typing a reply. :/) 




 Such a simple phrase, yet that would probably solve half the problem. Thank you for sharing.  




 I keep telling myself it will pass, but it hasn't.  




 I eat eggs occasionally, but have always been super picky with how they have to be cooked, otherwise I don't like the taste. 

The best sources for protein are definitely from meat, dairy products are also good and grains have some protein, but not much. I get most of my protein from dairy products and beans. I absolutely love milk and skim actually has more protein than whole milk.

If you're interested in studying nutrition, go for it. There is a lot of information out there and you could easily purchase books and learn a lot on your own. Just make sure they are credible. Nutrition is just my minor, but in my spare time I try to learn as much as I can.  




 Nutrition is one of the things I'm studying in school, and what you're saying makes a lot of sense. I've been pescatarian (vegetarian but eats seafood) for about 8 months now, and I'm sure I have several deficiencies based on my diet that hasn't helped my depression.  




 Exactly. If I could pinpoint it, then I could fix it. 

I'm sorry you're in the same boat. I wouldn't wish this feeling on anyone.  




 The word mate makes me smile. 

Have you found anything that helps? 




 Definitely not the answer I was looking for, but it makes sense.  




 Are meds really the only option? I was on some meds for about two months and I hated it, haven't been on them in almost a year and I really don't want to be. :/  




 Definitely going to print that off the next time I'm in the computer lab.

Thank you.  




 Words cannot describe how much what you said is what I needed to hear.  




 Thank you. :)  




 I also really don't want to be put on medication, and when I went to my family doctor, that was the first and only thing she did. 




 I know for me to actively seek out a therapist is probably the hardest thing for me, but probably the best step for me as well. I've admitted to myself that something isn't right, but if I admit it to someone else, that would mean I can't pretend that I'm okay anymore. 

One of my biggest fears is being told by a therapist that I need to just get over it - I know how ridiculous that sounds.  




 Which is more helpful, seeing a therapist or a psychiatrist?  




 I've thought about seeing someone, but I'm really bad at communicating how I feel and opening up to a stranger. Was it hard at first for you to open up? 




 Thank you. :)  




 I'm finding more and more uses for the blowtorch. Just used it to make Smores in my kitchen. Best investment ever.  




 Used this recipe http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/vanilla-bean-creme-brulee-recipe/index.html and used an entire vanilla bean instead of only half. Struggled with the blowtorch part a bit though, in the pic you can see some of the sugar wasn't completely caramelized, but on other ones I ended up burning it. Any suggestions? 









 I used to have a hedgehog named Popcorn, and this makes me miss him. This is adorable. :)  




 In the basement of Robinson is also an old butcher area and the freezers are creepy.  




 Even if the save battery dies, they are super easy to replace.  




 I feel your pain, the only internship I could find was nonpaying, but what makes it worse is I need the internship for graduation and thus I am paying for the credits.

I pay to go to work everyday... 




 What to expect: They will prick your finger before you can give blood to test your iron.  




 Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs - any good? 




 Call at age 5 to explain that there was nothing I could do to stop my grandpa and uncle from committing suicide, and to not waste the next 17 years trying to please everyone and feeling like a failure when I'm not successful. Because 1. It is impossible to please everyone, 2. Pleasing everyone won't bring my grandpa and uncle back, and 3. Even if people seem happy on the outside, it doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside. 




 I got glasses for the first time in 2nd grade and made the same discovery - I told everyone because I wanted to make sure everyone knew that trees had leaves. 
























 I'm not good at showing emotions so I just ate them and said how great they were.   




 My sister thinks I'm going through a phase and am crazy, yet at the same time she is one of my supporters.  




 Exactly. My parents keep vegetarian burgers, lasagnas, etc in the freezer for when I come home to visit. It's nice then even though I don't live with them, they want to make sure I have quick and easy access to food when I'm around.  




 I've been a fish eating vegetarian (pescatarian) for about 10 months now and the hardest part is family gatherings especially around holidays. Today is my family's Christmas get together and for Christmas we do a lot of finger foods: meatballs, ham rollups, veggies, etc. One of my favorite foods are my mom's ham rollups. I could easily eat a whole platter. I have never asked my family to change their recipes or make special accomodations for me - it's never been an issue finding something to munch on. Well today as we are setting the table, I notice something different, my mom made vegetarian ham rollups. Instead of wrapping the pickle and cream cheese spread in ham, she wrapped them in a spinach leaf. They tasted so good, even some of my meat eating family were snacking on them, I actually had to make sure I got some because the regular ham rollups were being ignored. 

This small gesture meant a lot to me, and I just wanted to share with you how awesome my mom is.  




 Inconceivable!  




 I'm sorry. I suppose I have some pretty understanding friends/family. I've received some grief from meat eaters, but I tend to brush it off and move on. I also found not mentioning it helps. Many of my friends don't even realize I'm pescatarian. Got to be stealthy. ;)  




 I'm pescatarian and it makes it easier. Make fish or order fish at a restaurant is easier than ordering vegetarian or vegan. My family loves that I'm not full out vegetarian because they can cook one meal everyone will eat. 




 WARNING: Has the emotional stability of an 8 year old.  




 Do you still need six and seven? 




 I know the feeling. I actually deleted my Facebook a couple months ago and it was the best thing for me. 
I've gotten closer with my few close friends, I've stopped worrying about what is going on in the lives of people who I used to know and comparing them to myself. I've even had some old friends reach out through phone calls and texts to see what's new in my life. The things I would want to post and sometimes did post, I now turn to my friends about and they've been a lot more helpful than I'd ever imagine.  




 As a Stephen King fan, I am super jealous. I own maybe ten of his books, but my goal is to have a Stephen King bookshelf one day. Thanks for sharing. :)  




 You are correct. Anyone can call themselves a nutritionist, but a dietician requires school, internship, and then an exam to become certified. 

Source: Once was a Dietetic major. 




 I will. Thank you!  




 Thank you. 




 Thank you for sharing what you went through. It's nice to know others have gone through the same thing. 

I've started searching for a good psychiatrist near me. 

Funny you should mention reading. Growing up I'd escape inside a book daily, but with school and work I haven't found time lately. Well last night I pushed everything aside and read just a few chapters of a non school related book. I've missed that.  




 I've contemplated driving recklessly into a tree. 




 To me up north was always the UP. 




 Mt pleasant is not up north....is it? 




 That's why I generally resort to saying "I'm tired" or "I'm stressed"
 




 True, I wouldn't want to put someone through that.  




 Thank you so much for taking the time to respond to all my questions. It really means a lot. :) 




 I've gone to the free services on campus before, but they don't really know how to deal with things like this. You get x amount of free visits and they are more for homesickness, help adjusting to college, balancing work and school, and various things like that. Their advice to me was "get involved on campus" and you'll feel better. Not really helpful in my case. :/  




 Thank you. I'm not ready to give up yet.  




 Getting hit by a car is another one that crosses my mind sometimes.  




 Have you had any negative side effects from taking GABA? 

Thank you for sharing what worked for you. :)  




 Same here.  




 Couldn't have said it better myself.  




 I work out when I can, could probably do it more often though. 

Slightly afraid of AD side effects, but also against the idea of them in general 
- I don't like taking medication in general.  
























 It has "Schick" written on the case and the end of the handle. I've done some research and I think it is a Schick Krona, but not real certain. I've been lurking on here for awhile, doing research before I went and bought my first razor, but then I found this while on vacation and impulsively purchased it. Is this a good choice for a first razor, or should I look for an alternative?  









 I've found that keeping my hands busy really helps me. Lately, including tonight, whenever I feel restless and in need of a distraction, I grab some hemp and make a bracelet. Something about the different knots and the repeating motion is soothing and helps distract me and calm me down. 




 Sounds exactly like my past two days. Hope yours goes better. If you need someone to talk to, I'm a good listener.  




 I may regret this, but all jokes are welcome.
I've been feeling down all day, so if it makes me laugh - I'm game. 




 I'll pick someone at 9:00pm Eastern Time


*Update

Thank you everyone for all of your jokes, they have brightened up my night. I was unable to just pick one, so I've selected ClassyAssBitch and johannvaust. I've messaged them and waiting to hear back.


**Update ClassyAssBitch has received their gift card. Still waiting on johannvaust 




 I tried to make some a couple years ago and forgot to grease and powder the pan. Trust me when I say that is the most important step.  




 I live about a mile from campus and walk, unless the weather is really bad or I'll be on campus way past dark. I hate when circumstances arise where I feel like I need to drive. I end up having to leave earlier because otherwise I won't find a spot, or students walking will cause me to sit at a stop sign for a solid 5 minutes. On top of that, there is the problem of feeding the meter every two hours so I don't get a ticket. Driving to campus really is more of a hassle than walking.  




 My roommate and I are both vegetarians. When we need our fast food fix we go to BK for the veggie burgers. Asking for a whopper with the vegetarian meat is my favorite.  




 I'm 22 and still have some servers treat my friends and I like shit because they think college kids tip poorly. I have always tipped upwards of 25% or more for good service, but if a server is terrible - I'm not afraid to leave as little as 5% tip.  




 I'm terrified of all dogs. I'm that person that would jump in front of a car to avoid a dog - big or small. Growing up I wasn't around dogs, and thus they make me kind of nervous. Maybe they lady wasn't breedist, just uncomfortable. Just a possibility. :)  




 I deleted my Facebook awhile ago and traded it in for linkedin. I'm connected to people still and in a much more useful way.  




 If I recall correctly, it ended when he went off to college.  









 Did that when I moved into my first apartment. Luckily the maintenance man was a genius and prepared for all the idiot college kids moving in and had his truck loaded with towels and some magical spray that more or less killed the soap bubbles.  




 One of my best experiences was at Wendy's. There was an older gentleman working and I asked if it were possible to have a sandwich with no meat. Many times I've been charged full price for a meatless sandwich. This guy went out of his way to get me a deal. Punched in the items individually and put it on a Jr sized bun, was about 70 cents and I think I had cheese on it as well.  




 Books.

I have a thing about owning the books I read, so I hardly go to the library. I have a favorite used bookstore I frequently visit and if I have the intention of purchasing 1 specific book, I leave with at least 2 others.

When I buy a house, first thing I'll do is convert an entire room into a library. So at least my hoarding will be in a central location?  




 I'm paying my own way through college. I'm a full time student and I work 35-40 hours a week. If I had the option to have my parents pay for my school, I'd accept in a heartbeat.

For the most part I'm indifferent to people who have parents that pay for their college. I've met a lot of different people in school, some that have their school paid for through loans, through scholarships, by working, or from their parents. How someone pays for school doesn't define them though. A good friend, coworkers, etc. wouldn't change how they think of you because of this.

The only time I've had any issues with someone who has parents paying for their school, is when they act spoiled about it.

As long as you don't walk around bragging about it, it's nothing to be ashamed of. 

TL;DR
I think they are pretty damn lucky.  




 I'm assuming you use a wood burning tool and then just spray it with clear polyurethane and it stays nice? Will it ever rot or should it last forever (or a lifetime)?  




 Did you text the number?  




 Thought I had it figured out, texted the number and apparently I'm not as good at math as I thought I was. Trying to figure out where I went wrong. :/  




 Maybe I'm reading this wrong, but were you the one to find your mother and discover she had died? As a five year old that must have been pretty traumatic and could have played a roll in not having you attend the funeral.  




 Glad it turned out alright! :)  




 I'm not an ASL major or minor, but took ASL 101 for kicks and giggles, and really enjoyed it. Had Kevin and he is awesome. I need a few more credits before I graduate in May and decided to take ASL 100 with him because I enjoyed his class so much.  




 As a broke college kid, I love Christmas for the same reason. That and small used book stores. I saw some people recommended going to the library, but there is something about having books of your own that feels so good.  




 Sometimes people cave. It's a personal choice. My family made prime rib for dinner last night. My older brother made it (an amazing cook) and it took so much will power not to eat any. Every side dish was vegetarian though, so that helped. 

I've caved, I know I'm new to this whole thing, and I accept I'll slip up sometimes. My reasons for being pescatarian aren't moral reasons, so if I slip and eat meat I just start over and try again. 

Tell your fiance you love him, but were really hungry and what you eat is your decision. :) 




 I'm sorry, that puts a damper on the holidays. Hope you have a merry Christmas and enjoy the time with your family despite grandma trying to trick you. :)  




 I've taken my own food with me places. All summer I kept vegetarian canned soup/pasta and microwaveable vegetarian items in my car because I never knew where I'd be when I was hungry and didn't want to burden the person I was dating with having to feed me. When I go to bbqs I always bring my own veggie burgers. I never expect someone to make accomidations for me, but appreciate it when they do. However I didn't grow up vegetarian and made this change after I had moved out on my own. When people order pizza, they generally get half a pizza with what I want on it. I'd suggest talking to your fiance's family and asking about being more vegetarian friendly. Maybe they don't understand it or don't know what to make.
