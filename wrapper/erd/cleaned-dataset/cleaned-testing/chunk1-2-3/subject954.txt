 Increase the maximum allowed players. my friend had this error just recently and that fixed it. 
























 There was a very similar thing with the forestry mod in the old tekkit. long story short the tekkit people were making money through ads on their sight and the forestry dev didnt like that so he made an update for his mod that only came out in tekkit and it erased the critical 32x32 area of chunks around spawn therefore corrupting the world. the mod was then removed from the pack 2 hours after this was found. 
























 yes ive seen this a bunch on reddit today
