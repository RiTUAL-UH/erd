 I think the driver had his seat belt on, but he took a tree limb to the face. 




 An earlier post got me thinking. We know that they went to school together, was Petey sneaking up the stairs (boys can't go up the girl's stairs) as a rat to crawl in bed with Bertha?

It's my headcanon that that is how Peter piqued her interest in Albania, because they had known each other at school.

Pimp Daddy Peter.  




 
I like the way you think. I think some of the other girls in the dorm might have noticed a large black dog or a stag coming in. Maybe not so much a rat that could sneak up and crawl in bed with.. I dunno, Bertha Jorkins perhaps? 




 ..and he put him through the motions three more times to try to show them how it's done. "Look at his eyes." 




 This is pretty much it. Riddle had to kill Harry in order to destroy his own bit of soul inside of Harry, essentially a creator destroying his own horcrux.

Albus has spoken a few times about certain types of magic...

Edit: I know that Harry was not a *true* horcrux, but he was still carrying a bit of Voldemort inside of himself.
 




 [This](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Cornelius_Agrippa) is another appearance of the word. 
























 Was George losing his ear an homage to Van Gogh? It wasn't specified in the book as to which ear he lost, but the film had his left ear bandaged. 









 "Say, what's your name?" the bartender asked the first duck.
"Huey," was the reply.
"How's your day been, Huey?"
"Great. Lovely day. Had a ball. Been in and out of puddles all day. What else could a duck want?" said Huey.
"Oh. That's nice," said the bartender.
He turned to the second duck, "Hi, and what's your name?"
"Dewey," came the answer from duck number two.
"So how's your day been, Dewey! ?" he asked.
"Great. Lovely day. I've had a ball too. Been in and out of puddles all day myself. What else could a duck want?"
The bartender turned to the third duck and said, "So, you must be Louie?"
"No," she said, batting her eyelashes.
"My name is Puddles." 









 How fcuking awesome was Minerva McGonagall? Such a powerful person, and the penultimate school marm. 

3.. 2.. 1.. GO! 




 He's just a big stoned kitty. 




 Would have taken over the DADA position after the second war? We know the jinx was lifted when Voldemort died, so would it have been a student from Harry's generation or would Minerva have brought in someone from the outside? 














 When they're on the hut on the rock, Petunia says that her sister would come home and turn teacups into a rats. That's big magic for a young witch.

Do you think the *Fera Verto* spell in CoS film was based on this bit in the first book? 




 I know that we only saw them one time with Lockhart, but damn those fuckers can do some damage. I would hate to have a nest near my home.

Same goes with Doxies. How do they even get in your home to begin with? 




 A laywoman was driving down the street in a sweat because she had an important meeting and couldnt find a parking space. Looking up toward heaven, she said, Lord, take pity on me. If you find me a parking place Ill go to Mass every Sunday for the rest of my life and give up drinking wine.
Miraculously, a parking space opened up right in front of her destination.
The woman looked up to heaven and said, Never mind, Lord; I found one on my own. 














 It just seems like they should have had some sort of protection around their wands. Perhaps a magically reinforced thin piece of steel that slid over your wand, except for the handle and tip, to keep it from breaking. That would have helped Ron, Neville, and Harry at least.

Does this seem ideal for anyone else? 














 You can hang the picture with only one nail. 




 Obviously, Voldemort used him for his savagery. Do you think there was ever a time when, like Draco, he regretted it? 

Seriously, that man was the foulest of the foul. Do you ever think there was a time Tom Riddle sat back and said, "DAMN!"?
 




 That's okay, the right side was weak. 




 When I bought DH at the midnight release, I stayed up all night reading. Around 06:00, my wife was getting up and getting ready for work. She came in to the living room just a bit before Percy tumbled out of the portrait of Ariana in the RoR. At that point, I sat the book on my lap and started clapping, "YAAY!" She looked at me like I had a third eye in the middle of my forehead.

My question is, what was an exciting part for you on your first read-through? 














 Ready.. steady.. GO! 




 To cast Gemenio on a human? 









 Bitches hate that. 









 What are your favorite chapters of the series? and why? 









 Two guys driving through Texas get pulled over by a state trooper. The cop walks up and taps on the driver's window, the driver rolls it down, and the trooper smacks the driver in the head with his night stick.
"Ow!" says the driver. "Why'd you do that?"
The trooper says, "You're in Texas, son. When I pull you over, you'll have your license ready."
The driver says, "I'm sorry, officer; I'm not from around here."
The trooper writes the guy a ticket and gives his license back, then walks around to the car's passenger side and taps on the window. The passenger rolls the window down, and the trooper smacks him with his night stick.
"Ow!" says the passenger. "What'd you do that for?"
The trooper says, "Just making your wish come true."
"What the hell does that mean?" asks the guy.
"Two miles down the road, you were gonna say, "I wish that lousy asshole would've tried that shit with me!" 




 Half a dog. 














 I only have three jets recycling because only three of my 38 hero roster don't need training.

 How jealous is Meg of Lily Mae? 
























 Mine would be Beedle. I read them to my daughters as bedtime stories for a few months when it was released. 














 A 6-year-old and 4-year-old are upstairs in their bedroom.
"You know what?" says the 6-year-old. "I think it's about time we started cussing."
The 4-year-old nods his head in approval.
The 6-year-old continues, "When we go downstairs for breakfast, I'm gonna say something with 'hell' and you say something with 'ass'."
The 4-year-old agrees with enthusiasm and they head down stairs.
When their mother walks into the kitchen and asks the 6-year-old what he wants for breakfast, he replies, "Aw hell, Mom. I guess I'll have some Cheerios."
Mom slaps him -- Whack!
The older boy flies out of his chair, tumbles across the kitchen floor, gets up, and runs upstairs crying his eyes out with his mother in hot pursuit, slapping his rear with every step. She locks him in his room and shouts, "You can stay in there until I let you out!"
She then comes back downstairs, looks at the 4-year-old and asks with a stern voice, "And what do you want for breakfast, young man?
"I don't know," he blubbers. "But you can bet your ass it won't be Cheerios!" 









 
about bullshit? 









 How envious of Harry was Draco? 

He seems like the sort of guy that would expect preferential treatment from his peers, then Harry comes along and produces a corporeal patronus in their third year, something that is seventh year magic or beyond.
I bet there are some fics on this, but let's hear what you lot think.

Edit: Does anyone care to speculate on what Draco's patronus might have been had he not been branded?

 Pirate walks into a bar with a steering wheel hanging out of his fly, bartender says, "Hey, you know you have a steering wheel on the front of your pants?" Pirate says. "Arrrrgh, it's driving me nuts!"

 My wife and I watched them all last night, and when it was over we looked at each other with confusion. We were trying to figure out how they would go back to jail, instead of just the ladies and Donna. 




 Was Carla's face while Perry* is trying to save his buddy that could have waited another month for a kidney in *My Lunch.* I always get misty watching that. 




 What do you buy?
 



















 Sirius or the other Azkaban escapees got their wands back? 



















 Why did JK choose that name? Doesn't it translate literally to 'pretty sticks'? 














 As each book was coming out, I would re-read in preparation. After 07/DH I have read the series five or six more times, but it has fallen off lately. Now I just read for certain moments or excerpts, since I pretty much know when things happened.

I guess I am saying that I use the books as more of a reference point than reading cover to cover, unless I'm on a long car ride.

What says r/harrypotter? How many times have you read, and do you still? 




 A man lay sprawled across three entire seats in a theater. When the usher came by and noticed this, he whispered to the man, "Sorry, sir, but you're only allowed one seat." The man groaned but didn't budge. The usher became impatient.
"Sir," the usher said, "if you don't get up from there I'm going to have to call the manager."
Again, the man just groaned, which infuriated the usher who turned and marched briskly back up the aisle in search of his manager. In a few moments, both the usher and the manager returned and stood over the man. Together the two of them tried repeatedly to move him, but with no success. Finally, they summoned the police.
The cop surveyed the situation briefly then asked, "All right buddy, what's your name?" "Sam," the man moaned. "Where ya from, Sam?" the cop asked.
And with pain in his voice, Sam replied, "The balcony." 




 We know from *Snape's Worst Memory* that Remus was a prefect, and he sat and watched James and Sirius *levicorpus* Snape, and the hoopla with Lily, and Remus still did nothing. 

Why would you give a werewolf a prefect's badge for starters, and do you think Severus ever held a grudge while he was brewing the wolfsbane?

 














 How a phoenix is born? Are there a limited number to begin with? 





























 We know that Harry did a bit of magic during his primary school days, that must make a lot of work for obliviators. Some schools have over 3,000 students. 




 My daughter has a large stuffed chimp that she calls "Monkey" and all I can think of is Grandma's Boy. We just had a lengthy conversation about Monkey, and me being 8.5 I couldn't stop laughing.

 Turn it inside out and shake the fuck out of it. 














 Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) and Emma Thompson (Trelawney) were co actors on an old BBC show called Tutti-Frutti.

If this doesn't belong here, I apologize. 




 I enjoyed the bits of Grawp, especially when Harry found out during the Battle of Hogwarts the "Grawp was, in fact, an undersized giant."

My point is, was he unnecessary? Order of the Phoenix was the longest book, and I think it could have been better if JK would have left out the parts about Grawp. 
 









 Mine would be Half Blood Prince. What a total mindfreak that was, always trying to find out what Draco was up to, Snape killing Dumbledore, Bill getting mauled, Fawkes singing his lament to the grounds, and the part that always got me was Fleur and Molly at the end. "And I shall do zat!" 




 Hello all, I'm new to reddit, and I have been a Potter fan since the first book came out. I just found this subreddit through the grapevine, and it looks fun. I look forward to having some good discussions! 
























 We're going to WWHP in August. I would just like her to get a grasp of the basic story before, because she was too young to know when we went the first time. 




 Absolutely ABC. 




 Was Fred Rapier or Rodent? 




 I know! It was almost two years between GoF and OotP. 




 School always starts on September first, but it is sometimes a weekend date also. 




 The older two have already read them all. 




 I don't either, but Lucius never got the chance to rise to the state of power that Bartemius did. 




 I wanted to pass on my knowledge, my father's knowledge really; and make some humans, because the entire act is glorious. 




 Not Bellatrix? Not Rodolphus? Not Rabastan? Not Dolohov, Mulciber, Rookwood or Travers? 




 This is brilliant, great job.

The only problem I have is that Lucy didn't know that Snape was a good guy, but then Mister Malfoy was not necessarily a bad guy either.

 




 Regardless, I think Barty Jr. was guilty and just thought he could get away because of who his father was. I imagine Barty as the previous generation's Draco.

Barty didn't like it when his father heard about it. 




 Potions and sweat. 




 Tasty buds.

 I just re-read it, chapter 30 GoF. 

As far as Sr. renouncing as his son, that didn't happen that way either did it? Or was Sr. simply complying to his wife's dying wishes?
 




 She's not having any trouble at all.

Love my little eaglet. 




 He was still caught with the other three.

I think it was a necessary punishment.
 




 I get that, but it wasn't until he mentioned it in front of Dobby in the staff room that his message got across. 




 Cheers!
 




 Well, you got the bit in the first book when they serve detention with Hagrid looking for whatever was killing the unicorns.

You got the bit in the second book when Hagrid told Harry and Ron to follow the spiders.

The bit in the third book when Hagrid walked his CoMC class deep into the forest to get to the hippogiriffs.

And I would also like to ad the scene in OotP when Hagrid introduced the trio to Grawp, and also when Hermione led Umbridge, Ron and Harry deep into the forest where Grawp was.

Edit: Ron didn't go with Harry, Hermione and Umbridge. 




 Not sure he was. Brings to mind the scene with the spider when he was showing the fourth years the unforgivables and he used the cruciatus curse in front of Neville, when he knew in fact that he had tortured Neville's parents to insanity using the same curse. Sure Neville didn't know his true identity at the time, but that was still a shitty thing to do. 




 Yaxley. He was an extremely powerful wizard with nothing but malice on his mind. 




 As you could probably read the book in an hour, I would start there. They are making this a trilogy all penned by Ms. Rowling herself, so it will go far and beyond the book I am almost sure. 




 Probably one of the first three. 




 They did say Voldemort in the cafe, but because of the fidelius charm on 12GP the DEs knew the general location, but they couldn't see the house. 




 There is a huge gap between canon and the films my slithery friend. 




 Chudley Cannons please. 




 LOL, all good man. 




 I love the entire arc of the book, but to me it drags on more than DH does sometimes. 

The main thing I dislike about it is fuckin' Umbridge. If any character in the history of fiction has ever made my skin crawl as much as Dolores Umbridge.

But she got hers in the end didn't she?

*clop clop* 




 Its not like the Death Eaters would be smart and keep them in separate evil lairs.

That made me laugh. 




 I agree completely my fellow lion. 




 I get the parenting thing, because I am one and I would do anything to get my daughter back, but I would not have resorted to telling my enemies/daughter's captor where the good guy was just to get her back.

I'm just saying that was a shitty thing to do. Why couldn't Xeno have just helped them, and let them leave in peace?

Edit: I'll answer my own question. That was after a bit of a lull in the story, so it brought some excitement.
 




 And he didn't even get Luna back after he said the taboo. The DEs just laughed at him.

*Treacherous little bleeder*
 




 Yea man, but stick to your convictions is what I say. 




 Xenophilius Lovegood. He was all about helping Harry until the DEs took Luna off the train. 




 If a person believes what they are saying, veritaserum can be tricked. It's the same reason a lie detector cannot be used in muggle court. 




 [The Greater Good](https://youtu.be/OGHBwk0quxs) is pretty awesome. 




 Correct, one is a curse, and the other is a charm. 




 If it were as simple as sending Voldemort an owl, don't you think the ministry would have thought of that? 




 If you read the text, chapter 13 of DH Hermione specifically uses the *Gemenio* charm to reproduce the locket. Chapther 26 of DH, Griphook plainly states that they have added the *Gemino* curse in the vault. Two different spells.

 I try to forget about Badenhop. 




 Don't know why you were downvoted, but this is correct. 




 did moody have the option of having a normal eye and chose to have the mad eye?

It's my headcanon that Moody made the eye himself, that would be the type of thing that would be dead useful for an auror, wouldn't you think? 




   And the security at Grimmauld place wasn't for Snape

No, Moody set up the tongue tying curse specifically for Snape, so he couldn't tell the other death eaters where it was. 




 Piertotem Locomortor

I've always wanted to use that spell. 




 What if d-o-g really spelled cat. 




 Definitely Helena Ravenclaw. 




 Yep, don't come here unless you want spoilers.
 




 That's what I thought. 




 I stand corrected. 




 Leave him be, the bible is as good a work of fiction as Harry Potter is. 




 He had seven after he attempted to kill Harry October 31, 1990, but it wasn't a real horcrux. 




 Correct, right before the start of year 4, so it might have been 93 even. 




 I don't know man, but if he is one of the best, they're sunk for the season. Chappy has already lost one this year, coaching perhaps? 




 Gemino curse was what caused the objects in the LeStranges' vault to multiplty. The Geminio charm is what Hermione used to replicate the locket after she took it from Umbridge, IIRC. 




 Only a knut to join SPEW. 




 It would have been a charm if anything and not a curse. I just think they sent that many. 




 He didn't make Nagini until 94 way after the basilisk was dead. Whether he knew that she was dead or not is another question. 









 What college do you go to? 




 I'm American, and I thought this was funny. Have my upvote OP. 




 Okay, I'm going to type slowly..

Kreacher belonged to the *Noble House of Black* and when Sirius told him to "Get out!" Kreacher took that as a command because Sirius was his master and he disappeared over the winter months, remember? Sirius was not very kind to Kreacher and the poor guy was locked up at 'Grim old place' with no one to talk to but Walburga's portrait. Padfoot even said he was crazy in the book.

When Harry inherited 12GP from Sirius he also inherited Kreacher, and that is why Kreacher was silenced when Harry told him to shut up in the chapter you spoke of, *Will and Won't?* One of my favorites. 




 Kreacher betrayed Sirius because he was abused and Sirius told him to, "Get out!"

Dobby on the other hand did what he thought was right, and punished himself accordingly. 




  it'd be quite beautiful if his last wand was the one he made for Luna.

I love this! 




 Ahhh, across the pond. I'll get there someday. 




 Gorgeous, where is that? 




 I think he would have been grateful, and would have probably made James, Albus, and Lily's wands for free.

If Harry had not come to Malfoy Manor, Garrick probably would have died there. 




 Been their many times. 




 Chum is FUM! 




 I like these, I watch these, but sometimes it's blatantly obvious that he did not read the books. 




 The Basilisk was a girl. The male are identifiable from the purple plume on their heads. 









 Da fuq?
 




 Correct. Hagrid made them walk deep into the forest, remember Ron and Harry thinking they were going to Aragog's lair? Hagrid probably just took down the corral and let them roam. 




 No, Harry is no where near as whiny as Luke. 




 Something like [this?](http://i.imgur.com/3woAuBW.jpg) 




 I don't know, it's hard to come up with an HP related pun for Parmelee.

Edit: Dumbledore's Parmy?
 




 Hippogriffs!

How sweet would it be to have a frickin' horse-eagle in your backyard anytime you wanted to go anywhere? 




 Dumbledore's Parmelee, FTFY. 









 How funny was Mel Brooks to work with on Mad About You? 




 Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition  




 Way to play it safe. ;o) 

I would expect nothing less from a classy lady such as yourself. 




 Hello Ms. Hunt. Who was your favorite actor to work with? 




 Sorry, it's a bad habit. 




 *Ob... viously..* 




 AHHH! My world has gone fubar for the day! How exciting would that have been? 




 One looks to the other and says "You know, I've never come this way before." The second replies, "Must be the cobblestones." 




 He shut the basilisk in the chamber and put it under a magical sleep until his own true heir returned to Hogwarts to awaken it, and that's what Riddle did. 




 How's Sunnyvale?
 









 That was the true veela at the QWC, and that is just the way they are. They weren't as nice looking when the leprechauns broke up their  chance at distracting the referee, were they?

Was it Mostafa? 




 Now that you mention it, I think I only know one or two people with real black hair. 




 Not sure what basis you're going on here, but they're described as beautiful creatures that have an ability to attract men. 

If you're on about the film, then that's just the way they chose to cast it. 




 Knew that Harry had Snape's old book? 




 I think Ron did in the film, but I'm almost sure Slughorn did when Harry approached him the first time about the horcrux after Albus gave him the task, it could have been another time. Maybe Hagrid's hut?

Edit: I mean the book in the second examples.
 




 that Slughorn called Harry the potions "Prince?" 




 I like to think that they shared little hints and such, and that was why Lily was so good? 




 Absolutely. Albus says something to the effect of Horace likes collecting famous and powerful people, and that he would try to collect Harry.

Dumbledore thought that because Lily was Horace's favorite student, and that Harry was her son, that Harry would be able to extract the memory to further the plot. 




 Thanks, I just know what I read in the books.
 




 I believe it was GoF after the graveyard that Dumbledore says that Harry Potter and Tom Riddle had gone farther to unite themselves than any two wizards in history that he knew of, so (paraphrasing) it was inevitable that there would be no way to completely keep them apart.

Albus was over 100 by then, a brilliant man such as himself would surely know wizarding history by now. 




 Regardless, Cornelius was literally ignoring the facts from someone that he would take advice from in the past, (Albus Dumbledore), nothing could have been said to assuage him. 




 Fudge would not have believed it anyway, and memories can be tampered with. 




 Still love your flair Boog. 




 There is a great book that starts out, "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four Privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much."

I'd start there.

Edit: I would avoid all of the films until you have read each book. 




 I was never a fan of the Lemon strains. Lemon Kush, Lemon Haze... they taste great but the high never lasts as long, and it's mostly in your head. 




 Not really as Kingsley was high up in the auror office at the time, I bet he could probably do whatever and wizards wouldn't give it a second thought.
 




   I assume Dumbeldore hooked him up somehow

I've asked this question before, and some have suggested that Kingsley nicked it from the ministry for him. 




 To add to your post OP, one of my biggest pet peeves is people that actually think that death created the hallows when in fact it was just three powerful wizards. 




 Right, the leaf doesn't reflect UV like the bud does. 




 I like that one. 




 I think it's just UV light. 




 I would call it albino.
 




 Not sure I'd risk naming my kid after my brother. What if he turned out to be an asshole? I would rather go with some folk that have already established themselves. 


































 Correct. It was less than a week before Sirius went to Azkaban after the death of the Potters.
 




 GoF is still on HBO, but it's probably the worst film, so who cares? 




 Ayup.  




 Yea. I went through the same thing. My parents adopted my mom's brother's daughter.

(I'll throw in former roommate for the joke) 




 Now that you mention it, he took a shower after every quidditch match.
 




 Yea, he only took one bath. Kinda gross. 




 If you buy the super expensive copies they have the deleted scenes on an extras disk, but ABC Fam just edits them all together.. most at least. 




 That's a good point. He would get new ones at the Dursleys. Not sure about the UK, but an adopted child gets assistance in the states. 




 Why is there no mention of Harry getting larger glasses as he ages? Certainly the glasses he had as a child would not fit him in his later years. 




 ABCFam also includes all  the deleted scenes. 




 You are right. But it just seemed tedious on my first read, I wanted to get into the action! But in my re-reads, it actually does fit in quite nicely. 




 You could start over, or join Pottermore. 




 Starts at 3:30 EDT today. 




 Gof or HBP.

Goblet was such a *whodunnit*, and Voldemort comes back, and Albus and Cornelius are on different planets at the end.

For HBP, it grabs you in the second chapter. I remember my wife and I reading it the release night thinking, "What the hell is Snape on about?" (we had always thought he was a good guy) Anyway we learned all about Riddle's past and the horcruxes, and then the ultimate act of bravery(?) happened, and there was nothing but speculation for the next 18 months. 




 I like you. I would tongue-punch your fart box all night. 

However, you seem a bit centered on the color of a person's skin. We all bleed the same color.

And... We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are. 









 No they didn't.
 




 He probably would have tried to kill Malfoy or at the very least completely discredit him.  




 It would have been interesting if She allowed Sirius to live until HBP, and he died because of one of Draco's failed attempts at Dumbledore. 




 Harry not using the damn mirror before rushing off to the ministry and an ambush. 




 You're on top of that story, aren't you. 




 I would think Sirius would teach the same things Harry taught the DA. Wasn't it Sirius and Lupin that gave Harry those defense books for Christmas in OotP? 




 It's common for only the first child in the states. 




 Four months is still a bit early for a baby shower though. They're usually done in the last trimester of pregnancy, but then I have no clue about English culture, 




 True. 




 Could be referring to Lily Luna. 




 A: One less drunk. 




 Once again, your essay does not disappoint. Bravo. 




 Perhaps she pricked him after his darkmark was fresh.
 









 My way home is my favorite also. Like /u/Best_Roommate says, My Lunch is a real tear jerker. 

I don't understand why so many like My Musical. I usually skip that one on the Netflix.

My Philosophy is a **GREAT** episode.

Edit: More would be: My Own American Girl, My Screw Up, and My Cake like everyone else.
 




 Probably Megadeth.
 




 I like it, but it looks like a cover-up with all the black. 




 I put mine between the cellophane and the pack. 




 Even worse is people who litter in state parks. (I'm American) These places are reserved for wildlife to grow abound, and people throw trash on the trails. When I hike, I pick up everything I see and put it in my pocket, even the butts. 




 Their grammar. You are the product of four billion years of evolution, act like it. 




  Firstly, the toilets aren't the only way in

They used the floo network also, but I will say that flushing yourself in was only implicated after Voldemort took over the ministry. 




 I'm 38, and I re-read at least once a year. I'm envious of you on your first read. 

Side note, I would stay far away from this sub until you are finished. 









 Darkmark goes on the left arm unless that's a mirror image. 




 The fifth house is Tigera. The founder was Taranus Tigera, the colors were orange and black, and she preferred her common room just outside the herbology department on the outskirts of the Forbidden Forest where she could be close to nature. 




 Yea, I think he sold them. Sorry. 




 I would imagine they could use the floo network within the castle. We saw it once when Snape wanted Lupin to look at the marauders map. 




 EDT* 




 It's mentioned plenty of times. Honestly, will you ever read *Hogwarts, a history?* 




 Well, Ginny did name Pigwidgeon. 









  She's not a doormat and she's not an angel.

No she wasn't. Lily was a fiery, strong headed ginger. That's where Harry got most of his bullheadedness from. Everyone thought Harry was so much like James, but I would propose that he was *most* like Lily wearing a James mask... except for the eyes of course. 




 YAY!
 




 Good enough for me, good night. 




 Professor Black did not hear everything they said. He only heard 'forest of Dean' whe Hermione opened her bag for the tent. When her beaded bag was closed, all he heard was the jumble of things. 




 I like that assessment, but I think the locket would have killed Harry. I don't think Snape would have been watching. 

Snape didn't know they had the locket, he was just trying to give them the sword.

Side note: How did Severus get it under a sheet of ice? 




 Half Blood Prince was my favorite, followed closely by Goblet of Fire.

We learned so much that tied the first five together in HBP, and GOF was the first one I read cover to cover in one sitting. My wife had read it first, and after I got to. Exciting after a werewolf runs the grounds.  




 I will. One of my friends in High School and I hung out simply because we had *Hem Hem,* connections. He was my age, and our mutual desire was two years younger.

From our junior year to our senior year, we fought over who was going to take her out. She broke up with him so I assumed she was free game our junior year. I took her out on dates for about three weeks, then we split amicably. 

Long story short, come our senior year we became good friends tying to cock block all of her new male interests. 

Not really *good friends,* but we hung out a lot more the last year.

Edit: We always had a discussion if the guy she was with was good enough for her. 




 That scene or the puff scene... 




 I've always liked this one. Reminds me of a time about 25 years ago in high school, when a frenemie of mine liked the same girl.

 /u/chimpwizard but he's in Australia and asleep now.

You could always check out hpcompanion.com, that does a chapter by chapter analysis also. 




 Yep! 




 Watch *In Bruges* totally different character. 




 A little boy goes up to his father and asks: "Dad, what's the difference between hypothetical and reality?"
The father replies: "Well son, I could give you the book definitions, but I feel it could be best to show you by example. Go upstairs and ask your mother if she'd have sex with the mailman for $500,000."
The boy goes and asks his mother: "Mom, would you have sex with the mailman for $500,000?" The mother replies: "Hell yes I would!"
The little boy returns to his father: "Dad, she said 'Hell yes I would!'" The father then says: "Okay, now go and ask your older sister if she'd have sex with her principal for $500,000."
The boy asks his sister: "Would you have sex with your principal for $500,000?" The sister replies: "Hell yes I would!"
He returns to his father: "Dad, she said 'Hell yes I would!'" The father answers: "Okay son, here's the deal: Hypothetically, we're millionaires, but in reality, we're just living with a couple of whores." 




 Probably a 7-2 offsuit, and she was repping a full house.

In all seriousness, I don't like kool aid. I do drink a lot of gatorade.
 




 Tell me a bird story. Ever had one get loose in the store? 




 I like the placement. 









 Way to catch up! 




 Allowed* 




 Oh yea, she had some serious necrosis. They had to amputate most of her calf muscle. 




 My cousin was bit on the right calf by a brown recluse, and lost a lot of her muscle in the same fashion. 




 She said so in an interview like Cronos said, but it wasn't at Hogwarts, it was in Hagrid's hut. 




 Albus used HR to know that Ron and Harry were in Hagrid's hut under the cloak in CoS. 




 TIL..
 




 What does a thestral have to do with death? I understand that only those that have seen death can see thestrals, but it still makes no sense.
 




 So? 




 Sure there is. One of the Slytherins biggest traits is self preservation. While the Gryffs would run into a fight (bravery), if a Slytherin knew that the outcome wouldn't benefit them, they would run away. 




 I'll have a Bertie Bott's, three chocolate frogs, three pumpkin pasties, and two licorice wands please. 




 I got it. 




 How do I change it? 




 Why change my flair?
 




  (as believed by Dumbledore)

Isn't that enough?

 




 Ravenclaw

Whichever position

I would like to be on the team

I have played mod quidditch 




 Harry! Harry! Did you choke on your toothbrush? 




 All well and good, except Ignotus Peverell created the cloak, not death incarnate. 









 OOHHH! My bad. I had to wait for each book.
 




 I had never thought about that aspect of it. Kudos!

Not to rain on your parade, but the quote is, "..why on Earth should that mean it is not real?" 




 I am old enough to have read each book prior to its corresponding movie

There was only one book. 




 That gave me a seizure thank you very much. 




 I would add that Universal was totally going under, and that addition saved and revitalized the park.
 




 I have no idea about Discworld. Just what I have read about the Potterverse. 




 She more than likely summoned them from the kitchen.  




 In the book, the glass never re-appeared, Dudley just fell in the water. 




 It's explained as *obliviate* in the film, but in the book she didn't wipe their memories per se, she modified them to make them think they were Wendell and Monica Wilkins, who's life's dream was to move to Australia.

Just another time the films took liberties to try to move the plot for the audience. 




 I think he was referring to the clothes they had on before they took the polyjuice. They all didn't have an identical wardrobe like in the film, just clothes that would fit. 




 Me too. In Bruges is another great one he's in with Ralph Fiennes. 




 On the rare occasion that a male werewolf meets a female werewolf while they are both transformed, and they mate, the offspring will in fact just be highly intelligent wolves. 

There *are* some of those in the forest, so perhaps that's what Riddle was referring to? 




 Ahhh, my bad. 




 Don't forget Crouch Jr. was under the imperius curse a long time himself.
 




 They're on Youtube.
 




 Listen to me, Potter. Your pal Diggory? By your age he could turn a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour is as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust, but Karkaroff's is not. They'll have a strategy. And you can bet that it will play to Krum's strengths. Come on, Potter, what are you strengths? 

In short, they were all exceptionally powerful. 




 Book would be GoF and film would be HBP. 









 I live under a bridge thank you very much. 




 Bob had bitch tits. 




 You know they float... 




 The duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore in the ministry.
 




 Not sure, he never talked about it much, but his nails were always wonky.
 




 Not really, it was still a boggart.

I re-created the feelings a dementor gave Harry, but it could never have kissed him. 




 Viet Cong shoved bamboo shoots under my dad's nails.
 




 Very nice. 

One question, are you implying Severus and Lily went together or do you mean that one of them did it of their own volition? 




 That's cool, how does she like it so far?
 




 Yea, we have all read them, and they are well worn. Some are held together with duct tape, and there are dog ears and underlines and notes.  




 She will more than likely be a Gryffindor. I see the traits in her already. 




 But of course. If there was ever a truer Slytherin in the series, it would be Lucius Malfoy. 




 But of course it's my fellow potterheads on Reddit. I have learned more from you lot, than I ever did in my 20+ rereads. 




 Someone preparing a Brazilian wax. 




 I ordered a pizza the other day, and when the girl was reading me back my order she says, "So you have one large, thick, sausage, anything else?"
I looked her dead in the eye and said, "Yes, I also ordered a pizza."
