 I watched Sunset Blvd for the first time a few months back and it didn't really do much for me. Maybe it's because I've seen bits and pieces of it used and parodied over the years, but it seemed mostly silly and hokey and old fashioned.

I watched Double Indemnity after that and I was like, "Holy shit, why did nobody ever tell me this movie is so good?". That whole film is so good from beginning to end and it seems much more modern, if you can say that about movie made when Hitler was still a going concern. 




 The show has been in repeats for a couple years now, but this is still very sad news. 

Nothing like driving around on the weekend, running errands and listening to the Tom and Ray yak it up on the radio. He will be missed. 




 I think Will will eventually out himself, maybe after another suicide attempt. 




 Please add me. test_subject96 




 For me, Cloud Atlas was a movie that tried too hard to be clever and ended up being much more clever than good. 

For example, the idea of having actors portray several different characters in the movie, some of different age gender, race, age, etc probably seemed really cool on paper, but I found it distracting and often silly. A lot of times when the film moved to a different time period I'd spend a good amount of time trying to figure out who was who and what that meant. When your effects and makeup get in the way of your story, you've made the wrong choice.

Which is really kind of sad because I did like a lot of it. I found parts of the stories very compelling and a lot of visuals were interesting, but in the end the whole thing just didn't hang together for me. 




 Dude, seriously? You're working fifteen hours a week and your boss thinks it's some kind of long-term career for you? How could anybody expect anyone to live on that?

Get a solid start date from your new job and two weeks before that walk into your boss's office and tell her you're giving your two weeks notice. Thank her for the opportunity and ask her what things she'd like to finish up/document before you go.

If she gives you trouble, just tell her how sorry you are but the position offers more money and the opportunity to transition to a field you're more interested in. You can also offer to take on freelance work if they're stuck, especially since the new job isn't F/T. Just remember that your freelance rate should be at least double your W-2 hourly rate.

Lastly, don't worry so much about what other people do can do or can't do or make or whatever. Focus on yourself and what you can do and what the value of that work is.

Good luck! 




 Yeah, maybe part of my problem with the movie is that the trailer raised the bar so much and the film just didn't deliver.  




 The Papa Johns one was the worst. The others (Cinnabon, eHarmony, etc.) passed mostly under my notice, but the Papa Johns really pulled me out of the film. 




 I hope this is not too basic a question, but does anyone have any simple tips for taking pictures of merchandise for sale online?

I have a client that own an antique lighting store. He has hundreds, maybe thousands of items in inventory: chandeliers, floor lamps, table lamps, etc. He wants to take pictures of a lot of his stock to put on the new website that I'm building for him. 

I've done a lot of searching online, but nothing I've found really seems to address this specific thing.  




 The thing is this. Wind turbines kill about 500,000 birds a year. Cats kill one to four BILLION birds a year. If the people complaining about this were truly concerned about bird deaths, instead of looking for a reason to criticize wind power, they'd be pushing to ban or at  least restrict the cat population.

Also, wind power is about 4% of US energy production. If we built enough wind turbines to power the whole country and the bird death rate per kwh remained roughly the same, wind turbines would be killing around twelve million birds a year, still less than ten percent of the number of birds that die from just flying into buildings. 




 Yeah, this. 

I got two TouchPad's during their $99 fire sale. I used the native WebOS for a while. It was slick. Better than Android in a lot of ways. But eventually not having any apps made it less and less useful.

I eventually installed CyanogenMod on both of them.  




 I imagined the title of this thread being read Werner Herzog's voice and it was glorious. 




 I wouldn't feel all that broken up or morally conflicted about taking the better offer. 

The smaller firm obviously thought they could hire a new employee at well below market rate if they put in an offer very early on in the process. It's a negotiating ploy. You don't have to fall for it.

FYI, $6.00 an hour is roughly $12,500 a year if you work a 40 hour week. That's a huge sum of money and something that will likely influence your earning power for the rest of your life.

Take the better offer and don't look back. 

 




 The Last Starfighter is still one of my personal faves from the 80's. How can you beat the great Robert Preston as a interstellar con-man/recruiter?

It's a decent film, although it's hampered by a muddled third act and some pretty unimpressive villains.  




 6/21/04 for me. 26,351 e-mails in my account. 




 Borat. I find the whole concept of the film, tricking average, everyday people into looking stupid or foolish or racist or whatever so that other people can laugh at them to be morally reprehensible.  




 I can't speak to your specific experience, but if you feel you've been misclassified as a 1099 worker, then there are steps you can take.

http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-should-you-do-if-youve-been-misclassified-independent-contractor.html

The IRS does often bring the hammer down on companies that improperly classify their workers as independent contractors. 




 Thanks, Remo! Went to bed and woke up with a pile of donuts and other goodies. 

You're the best! 




 You can't just declare employees independent contractors to get around minimum wage laws. The IRS has [fairly strict rules](http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses- -Self-Employed/Independent-Contractor-Self-Employed-or-Employee) about this and they're more than happy to rain fire and death on you if you try to play cute with them.

 




 "You'll get over it"

Said to my Dad by my Mom when he was trying to get back together with her after leaving for the third or fourth time. 




 Nothing that you would find very interesting, most likely. At that stage, the only real differences you would find would be typos, misspellings, grammar, punctuation and maybe some word usage. 




 A DAW editor gave it to me back when the book first came out. 




 I do web sites for small, local businesses. An issue I've been running into more and more is that the business will have a Google Places listing that was set up for their business by someone else some time ago. They have no control of it and have no idea who might. 

Right now I have three clients who are in this situation, a small HVAC contractor, a pizza place and a lighting shop. The pizza place is really in bad straights because the Google listing points to a domain that is now owned by a domain squatter.

I have submitted the recovery form and then followed up with an e-mail, but no luck so far.

Any help or directions would be appreciated. 




 So I'm decluttering and getting rid of a bunch of old stuff I don't want anymore. I have the original bound galley of Name Of The Wind with the note from Betsy Wollheim  on the cover. 

I know that this was considered quite the collectible at one time, but I can't find any listings for it online. 




 Where would I find that phone number? 




 The show been soapy for a while now. I'm just waiting for someone's evil twin to show up during sweeps week. 




 On a related note, has anyone had luck recovering a Google Places/Google Plus listing for one of their clients. I do mostly small, local businesses and it seems like a lot of them have a listing that was set up by someone else and they have no idea who it was or how to get control of it. 




 Women received over 57% of the bachelor degrees awarded in the USA in 2012. Can someone explain why there should be general, women-only scholarship funds at all?

 I live in a 60 year old house in Long Island, New York. It's a two story house, 1400 sq ft house with a single zone and 13 cast-iron radiators for hot water heat.

When we bought the house in 2010, one of the first things I had done was to replace the old, oil-fired burner and cheap , gas hot water heater with a new Burnham Alpine Condensing Boiler and a Buderus S120w indirect hot water heater.

Now when the system works, it's great. The house stays nice and warm in the winter and my gas bills are low.

The problem is that during the transition from heating season to non-heating season and also from summer into heating season, I get a lot of air in the hot water system. The system gets air bound and I have to turn the system off, close a valve and open the water spigot and let water run through a hose into a bucket until all the air is out.

This obviously creates several problems. One, I have no hot water. Two, the circulator runs and runs until I fix it, which can't be good for it and third, when It's cold out I have no heat because the burner is programmed to heat the hot water before it heats the house.

The guys who installed the system don't seem to have a good solution for me. The added an air eliminator right above the hot water circulator, but that didn't seem to help.

The system was fine all summer, but then it got a bit chilly, the heat kicked on and now I'm down in the basement bleeding the system on a daily basis.

Today I tried running the heat and then opening the bleeder valves on the radiators to try and clean out some of the air. No joy there. The problem remains.

If anyone has any idea of how to either

1)    Keep the air from getting into my system or
2)    Have it be automatically eliminated or other wise dealt with

I'd appreciate it 




 There's no requirement under the FLSA to pay you extra money for working a holiday, so, by that metric, you were paid 7 hours at your OT rate, whether they call it holiday or OT is probably not relevant.

Although I can say that when I get extra pay for working a holiday, I also get OT if I go over 40 hours a week, holiday hours included. 

You might want to look at your company handbook and see what it says on this subject. 




 I doubt that FX is going to cancel it, given all the positive buzz it's been getting. It used to be that all that mattered were ratings, but I think positive critical acclaim has a lot of value these days and I can't see a cable channel like FX ditching a show that everyone is writing about.

I loved Legit, but pretty much nobody wrote about that show or even mentioned it, especially during its second season where it may well have been in witness protection. 




 The bad guy is kinda meh and that hurts the movie quite a bit, I think.

When your big bad is a sleazy defense contractor whose evil plan is to just continue ripping off Uncle Sugar by making defective/substandard weapons, it takes some of the juice out of it.

Otherwise it's a fun flick. The Remo/Chiun stuff is great. I loved Kate Mulgrew's snarky femism. 

It's interesting also as an example of how movies have changed. There's not much in the way of a big action setpiece. And there's no way they'd cast a white actor as Chiun in 2014. 




 The comments on that page are priceless. 









 I did work for ZapMyTax.com and I also used them to file a grievance.

My taxes didn't go down, though.  




 It's like what Michael Mckean has said about Spinal Tap in concert, "We pretend to be a rock 'n' roll band, and they pretend to be our fans," 




 Wrong. You are never allowed to make employees work before punching in. Never.

If they show up early and you're swamped, have them punch in early. If business rules prohibit this, then they can not work.

All hours worked by an hourly employee must be be paid. 




 I wish I could upvote this comment a zillion times 




 I have the same issue on my Galaxy S2. I have a ton elixir to spend now too. 




 Yeah, the game kept crashing on me this morning and now I can't get to the game at all. It keeps bombing out. 




 The thing about Babylon 5 is that the idea of it was just so much greater than its execution.

J. Michael Straczynski (the show runner/creator) promised a strongly serialized show with a predefined, complex, multi-season story arc about war and politics between multiple, star-spanning empires.  There show would have compelling personal drama and an emphasis on hard, science-based SF.

What we got was, more often than not, a muddled mess with terrible dialogue, lazy plotting, poor acting, cheap-looking sets and a giant helping of sledgehammer o' message on a regular basis.

One thing people may not know is that not only did Straczynski create and run the show, he wrote 92 of the 110 episodes of the show.Apparently, even the 18 episodes that were done by other writers were extensively re-written by him. There's a good reason why that kind of thing isn't done.  Nobody can  produce content at that rate (and run the show too) and maintain any kind of quality.  

There's a great quote from, often attributed to Mark Twain but actually penned by Edgar Wilson Nye, "Wagner's music is better than it sounds". 

This kind of sums up my opinion of B5. When I watched the show back in the day, I was often unhappy with what wss on the screen, but there were hints and shadows of great things just around the corner. There was, I think, a much better show hidden inside, but Stracznski's limitations and his control freak nature basically smothered it.

What's interesting, looking back, is that B5 was in many ways a prototype for modern, serialized, mystery-driven, genre TV shows like Lost, Battlestar Galactica, etc. 




 Even with an epidural, jiggling your diaphragm with your uterus cut open can be pretty painful. 




 Hodor? 




 My wife had a c-section, so she couldn't see the baby right away.

"Hey, she looks like your dad."

"Really?"

"Yup, bald and angry"

Pro-tip, don't make your wife laugh when she's just had a c-section. 




 It's kinda cool, but what would you use it for?  




 It's important to understand that employers are liable for all hours worked or suffered to be worked by all their employees. If you worked overtime, even if it of your own volition without any direction from your manager, you have every right to put it on your time card and the company must pay you for it.

I'm not sure how long ago this was, but the company owes you this money and you can file a complaint or file suit to recover it. 




 I've been on Ting for just over a year now. The Missus and I both have Galaxy S2's that I scored on eBay.

My wife's major issue with the S2 is the camera. Her friend showed her  all the great pics she took with her S5 and there was much envy. I can't really swing $600 for a new S5 now, so I'm looking for an alternative that might serve. 




 Did you watch the video? Obviously you can only afford this if you already have a BMW. 




 My dad always had dreams of being a Jewish cowboy. 

When I was growing up, my house had tons of western memorabilia.  









 I really should know better than to read the comments at espn.com. 




 While I'm not particularly interested in taking sides in a squabble between Katy Perry or Rhianna and the NFL, it's hard to overstate how tone deaf this is.  

You have some of the biggest, most popular acts in the world and the NFL is not only asking them to play for free, but to actually pay for the privilege like they were some garage band at a bringer show. 
 




 Seriously. Why not just auction it off to the highest bidder? 

That could end up being a lot of fun. 









 The key with using CraigsList is persistence. You have to look every day or even several times a day and then jump on things when they pop up. Don't dither or fart around.

I got almost all my home gym stuff on CL. 500 pounds of Olympic Plates, rack, bench, treadmill, elliptical, dumbells, floor mats, etc. The only things I've bought new are an incline bench for situps and some smaller plates to round out my collection. 

Pro-tip, you can set up RSS feeds of specific searches and view them in your favorite feed reader. No need to even visit the site. 



















 I have one. I've been using it since I joined Ting a year ago. 

I like it fine. I play some games on it and watch movies (Netflix/HBOGO) and it works OK. It's gotten a little wonky of late and I think it needs a factory reset.

I've been thinking of getting an S3, but honestly I prefer the S2's smaller size.  









 On the one hand, that's horrible and disgusting, but on the other hand...you do have to admire their dedication. 














 Um...isn't it obvious?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIVe-rZBcm4 




 I have a Sprint-branded Galaxy S2 that I bought on eBay and brought to Ting. Lately it's been acting up and I'm thinking I'll reset it to factory before considering a new phone.

If I do this, is there something I have to do to make it work with Ting? I remember entering some codes that Ting sent me when I first acquired it. Do I have to do that again? 




 Umm...it's like...a joke. 




 It's not like he's working much since they wrapped production on Serial Apeist 2 









 He was out. 




 Thanks, man! 

I just know, deep in my heart, that if I'm not being charged a convenience fee, I must somehow be being inconvenienced. 




 I bought two S2s off of eBay last year to use on Ting. Pretty good deal and no problems so far. 




 So, I've been on Ting now since August of 2013. Before Ting I had VZ and I was paying over $160 a month for me and the missus, with a preferred employer "discount".

I don't make a lot of phone calls. I rarely text and I almost always use my phone somewhere where there's WiFi.  So I was a little shocked the first time I got a bill from Ting.

Twenty six bucks and change.

Not twenty six bucks per phone. Twenty six bucks total for two phones. That's...kinda crazy, isn't it. 

I almost want to call them up and say, "Are you sure that's enough? I can pay a little more if you guys are strapped." 




 Still no actual trailer for Tyrant? Seriously, this thing starts in just over a month. Shouldn't they have some actual footage from the show to show us by now? 




 [Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band](http://www.feelnumb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/The_Beatles_Sgt_Peppers_lonely_hearts_club_band_hi_res.jpg)

 http://www.wpthemedetector.com/ works pretty well, I've found. But, as noted above, this site is not a WordPress site. 




 Seriously? How many options do you think the average person has for internet access? Most people have one good option and maybe one or two more increasingly crappy ones. 

I myself have Optimum Cable Internet. If I wanted to switch away from that, my only option is a craptastic DSL line. A lot of people don't even have that.

How can you have competition without any competitors? Do you think, in the absence of government regulation, companies will spring up to run fiber to my house so that they can go head to head with my cable company? They'd be better off piling their money in the middle of the floor and lighting it on fire. 




 Looks nice. 

Could it be easily modified to work booking appointments in a nail/hair salon? 




 The real key to this is not that the sequel was so, over the top, bad. I mean, it wasn't good, but there are certainly worse sequels. 

The key bit is that ads for the sequel started SIX WEEKS after the original movie hit the theaters. The sequel itself was out just a few months after that. B2:EBOO represents the epitome of a sequel for sequel's sake.  




 I've used this in the past and it works pretty well for what you want

http://wordpress.org/plugins/catablog/

It requires a reasonable amount of work to bang it into shape, though. 




 Job Manager. 

The last site I did for, which was not a WordPress site, him had a nice, job board feature that I custom wrote in PHP/MySQL. I figured I'd save a little time this time around and use a pre-existing plugin.  




 Long story short, I created a site for a client last year using a free plugin from wordpress.org/plugins. I evaluated a bunch of premium plugins, but the free one was clearly the best for my needs.

After setting it up and turning it live, I noticed that there was one bit that wasn't working correctly. Going back to the support forum, I then read that author had moved on to other projects. Now I'm concerned that some future WP upgrade will just break it completely and my client will be unhappy (to say the least).

Has this happened to you and what have you done about it? I could maybe switch to another plugin, but it would require a fair amount of work setting it up, work that I might not be able to bill for. 

I've also considered trying to fork the project myself. I've never written a WP plugin, but I've done a lot of PHP work over the years and I figure I'd be up for it. Has anyone else done this?
This is a fairly complex plugin 




 WP-Client looks like a useful bit of software, but I don't think I can give money to any company that autoplays a video with audio right on its front page.

 Ratings were marginal, although it was up against American Idol, which was a ratings juggernaut back then.

I really thought it was a good show. Ray Wise was great fun as the devil.  




 Champion! 




 You can watch the trailer for "DOOMED! The Untold Story of Roger Corman's THE FANTASTIC FOUR" and see what you think.

http://youtu.be/mNLcjWIzQHM 




 The movie was made seriously on the cheap and a lot of the people who worked on the film took very little money to work on it in the hopes that the exposure of being in a major, superhero film would pay off for them.

Ooops. 




 That was...not good.

The parking garage fight was just a lot of guys randomly flailing at each other and once they get into the elevator, they just wave huge knives around in the air until everyone falls down. 




 I'm actually a big fan of smart, mixed-used development. But, as I noted above, there were a lot of unaddressed issues with The Lighthouse project, especially with respect to transit and infrastructure. Wang though he could just ignore them and push the project through by setting deadlines that he insisted the local authorities had to meet.

Not to mention the fact that the development rights to the area around the Coliseum were and are tremendously valuable. Why should Nassau give them away for free just because Wang happens to own a hockey team? 

And, since this is Nassau County, the bribe envelopes were probably just way too light. 




 Hey, you're young and swingin'

No time to think about tomorrow

But there ain't no way to deny it

Some day, you're gonna buy it.

Plan today,

Go with Ferryman tomorrow!

Ferryman, Ferryman,

he's the man with the plot, the man with the plan!

Ferryman, Ferryman,

He's the mortician man who loves you!

A lot!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG9Xj5cCSZk 









 Wang wanted to build a huge, mixed use development around the area of the Coliseum, the Lighthouse Project. Problem was, there are a lot of issues with dropping a huge development like that into the heart of one of the most densely-packed counties int he nation. And, from what I remember, all of the serious issues, from traffic to parking to water and sewer, were essentially dismissed with head pats hand waves.

When that fell though, Wang turned around and asked Nassau to foot the bill for a 400 million building, which the people of Nassau wisely rejected.

It's sad that the Islanders are leaving, but these kind of huge development boondoggles can haunt local governments for decades if they go all pear shaped. Ask the Brooklynites how the Atlantic Yards thing is working out for them. 









 I still consider Dragonslayer one of the best Fantasy movies of all time. It engages seriously with a lot of the classic fantasy elements and slyly comments on them as well.

And, then there's this 

No, of course not. They never do tests. Not many real deeds either. Oh, conversation with your grandmother's shade in a darkened room, the odd love potion or two, but comes a doubter, why, then it's the wrong day, the planets are not in line, the entrails are not favorable, "we don't do tests"! 




 Bah, this could be such a cool show and they morph it into another CBS procedural.

Limitless would be cool as a Fugitive (or Incredible Hulk, if you prefer) "man on the run" show. You could still have the procedural element as the main character solves crimes and helps the downtrodden as he's tries to avoid being caught by the shadowy government agency that wants him dead and looks for the secret to NZT before he runs out.

Actually, sounds a lot like The Hulk. Man, I loved that show. 




 I'd say that L.A. Story is my favorite Steve Martin movie, but this one is certainly one of my favorites. It's such a rare thing for a romantic comedy to have both good romance and good comedy.

Martin is just so good as a romantic, leading man in this film, it's a little sad that he didn't do it more often in his career. And Daryl Hannah, while not bringing a lot to the table acting-wise, is at her peak hotness.

Plus I love that the nose is just so over-the-top, cartoonish and ridiculous, but everyone just plays it straight. 




 I asked my wife to marry me in a similar fashion. 

No cake, though. Ring rolled in a note tucked inside a piece of 1930's-era art pottery. 




 Here's what it means.

We're not going to pay you any actual money because we don't have any. Even though one of the biggest reasons for startups to fail is under capitalization, and not being able to pay employees is a huge, red flag, not to mention illegal,  we'd like you to risk everything on this supremely bad bet. 

 But, in the unlikely event that the company takes off and your equity is actually worth something, rest assured we'll find a way to screw you out of that too. 




 Not me. 

I don't mind a few ads, but because their ad inventory is so limited you see the same fucking ad over and over and over again.

I binge watched The Good Wife on Hulu+ and the only way I stayed sane was by pulling the earbud out of my ear whenever the ads started to roll. 




 In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. 




 Did you actually sign a non-compete agreement?

It's pretty unheard of for non-competes to be enforced against low-paid, hourly workers. Generally, you need to be fairly high up in the food chain and the business has to have legitimate business interests to protect, clients, trade secrets, etc. They can't enforce a non-compete just because they don't want you to work somewhere else.

What state do you live in? Non-compete laws vary widely by state and some states don't allow them at all. 




 Maybe he was dictating. 




 Generally, mandatory tip out/tip pools are limited to employees who regularly receive tips. A valid tip pool may not include employees who do not customarily and regularly received tips, such as dishwashers, cooks, chefs, and janitors.

 You don't have to type up an official letter. You're an intern.

Once you have a solid job offer from campus IT (very important), just meet with your boss as soon as possible and let him know when your last day is going to be. 

For something like this, it's always good to thank him for the opportunity and tell him how much you've enjoyed working there. Then ask if there's anything he wants you to finish up or document before you leave.

Then shake his hand and say thanks again. 




 Have you tried replacing the .htaccess file with a a blank one and then setting the permalink settings again?

I could probably help you with this, but you're probably better asking on /r/WordPress 




 Yeah, over 20 days you should get 2880 elves max from spawning and a potential 240 from tapping the elf cave, although in practice it would be pretty hard to do that unless you log in every eight hours on the dot.

That's 2920 elves. According to my calculations, the cogwheels to elf ratio is roughly 1.2. Tapped elves drop four cogwheels roughly 30% of the time. So your theoretical cogwheel max is 3504 from elves. Plus another 200 from your daily bonus once a week. That's 3704, which gets you to a level 16 cannon. 

You're still over 3000 short from level 20. 




 I'd like to see some DC animated stuff on the CW in prime time. I'm a little surprised that this hasn't happened already. 




 I'd say Arrow took about a half a season to really hit its stride. Things started to come together with the Huntress arc and really took off once Slade Wilson and Felicity Smoak became regulars.  




 Bottom line? The show is just a lot more fun than Arrow.

Don't get me wrong. I like Arrow and I think it's a fine and entertaining show, but we've seen a lot of that stuff before in other places. A lot of the tone is similar to what we got in the Nolan Batman movies. 

Flash is a more accessible character. The show has kept the brooding and self-loathing to a minimum and played up the lighter, more entertaining aspects of the story. Barry has a cool power and he enjoys it.

Plus, the CW really caught lightning in a bottle with Grant Gustin. He's got a ton of charisma . 




 You also might want to consider the possibility that you're being hazed. Blue collar jobs often involve some hazing of newbies. I could see that expecting you to remember the whole schedule could be a joke they're playing on you. 




 What kind of idiot runs a company based like this based on employee memory? You're talking about over a hundred different bits of data every week. I have a very good memory and there's no way I could handle that. 

What is it that your "too slow" about? If it takes you a couple minutes to look up data on a spreadsheet the world grinds to a halt? That's just very odd. 




 Some interesting responses so far. 

I've always been the guy, when random new things come up, I figure out how to make them work. That's kind of how I started doing web pages. I wrote my first CGI program in compiled DOS basic so it would run on an EMWACS web server. 

I'm also the guy who often figures out what the solution to a problem is, even if I don't personally have the skill set to implement it. I can usually find the right tool or the odd bit of software or the best person to do a job. Plus I have a knack for listening to people's problem and finding out what the real issue is and how to solve it in principle at least before we even get to the technology part of it.

I have one old client who calls me up when he has these kinds of seemingly intractable problems. But how would you market and monetize that to other people? 

Hey, I'm a lot smarter than anyone you have working for you. If you have something nobody you work with can figure out, I probably can.

Sounds pretty dubious and not a little bit douchey. 




 I believe that it is, in fact, mathematically impossible to get to level 20 cannon without dumping atomic shitloads of donuts into buying cogs.

If I did the math correctly, the total number of possible elves over the course of the event is 2880. That's six elves an hour times 24 hours times 20 days for the event. 

To get to level 20 you need over 6000+ cogwheels. 
 




 Dude, are you telling me that your bosses don't know the phone number for human resources? I find that hard to believe.

That's who you need to call. Tell them you're being paid the tipped minimum wage even though you receive no tips, in clear violation of the FLSA. Even if you were a tipped employee, you would have to be reporting your tips and Applebee's would have to make up the difference if your tips didn't push your earnings up to the minimum wage.

The odds that these people are just shining you on, telling you how hard they're working to correct your pay while not doing anything are pretty good.  

Good luck. 




 I've been doing part-time, freelance IT work for about two decades. I've done all manner of different and varied IT tasks for small and medium sized business. 

These days I mostly do WordPress websites, but I have one client, my oldest client, who calls me up when they have random issues that they have no answer for. For example they had a client whose website was built in some crappy, custom , undocumented PHP CMS and I was able to transfer it over to a new server and keep it running for a couple years while the new website was being built.

So, it occurred to me this week that this might be a way I could market myself. I'm a decent enough coder and I have a raft of general IT skills, but my true talent lies in being able to poke at a problem until I find the soft part where the solution lives.

I do a lot of this kind of random problem solving in my day job doing scientific research support.

So, the questions are are these. One, is there a real need for this sort of thing? And two, is there a way to market this without sounding like a self-important douche bag?  




 Except that this is not true at all. 

The US Attorney's office released some "get tough" press release where they said Aaron was potentially facing thirty or fifty years in prison or whatever. They took all the crimes he was charged with, added up the max sentences and voila, he's spending the rest of his life in prison. You see this kind of thing all the time. Blah blah person is facing SIX HUNDRED YEARS in prison or some nonsense.

Except that Federal sentencing doesn't work that. There are guidelines based on intent, damage caused, the number of offenses, etc. Given the circumstances it was very unlikely that Aaron would have gotten more than a year and even possible that he would have gotten off with probation.

It's a little confusing for some people because the CFAA, like a lot of federal crimes has a hefty max penalty, 20 years in this case, but no minimum. 




 Why was it wrong? What was wrong about it?

Swartz broke the law. He broke it knowingly and caused a lot of issues for people on the MIT campus.  It's certainly not unreasonable for a US Attorney to want him to spend a few months as a guest of the Federal Government because of that.

It was sad that he killed himself, but that's nobody's fault but his own. We don't even know that killed himself because of the prosecution. He didn't leave a note or other indication.  




 What's the point of that? If donuts don't give you much of an advantage, people won't buy them. 




 I'm thinking I might quit the game for a couple weeks. The whole tap the elves thing is boring as hell and there's no way I'm getting the island at this point. 




 I know, right. Every time I hang out Mike Colter he's all like, "The  Wire is the best show ever on television" 

And I have to go, "Dude, you know I love you, but season 5 still stinks" 




 The other reason to ask for a higher number is to discourage this from happening in the future, at least discourage it from happening routinely.

I assume that, since you quit, you don't want to work there anymore. If they feel they can call you back at your old salary, what's to stop them from doing it all the time?

If they really really need you to come back and train their new hire as a one time thing, double your original rate is very cheap. If they don't really need you to train this new person or if they actually want to see if they can get you to come back in and do more work from time to time, then double your rate is too expensive and they won't pay it. By this method, you determine their true intent.  




 The correct answer is at least double your regular hourly rate. 

Look, you're doing them a big favor here by coming back and training their new hire after giving them more than ample time to find a replacement. The least they can do is pay you for your time and inconvenience.

And tell them you want payment in advance. 




 The only thing I would say here is not to make a decision out of fear. You've got a year to go before your job might go away. Don't take a demotion and less money because of that.

A year is a long time. Anything can happen between now and then.

Believe in your own value. If it were me, I'd call the recruiter and tell him that you're not interested in a Tier 2 job. You've got the requisite experience and have been working in the Tier 3 role for some time and you can't see any good reason to take a step down in salary and responsibility.

Of course, that's easy for me to say. It's not my job on the line. But with a year to go, a good skill set and the economy on the upswing, I like your chances. 

Good luck.  




 You're being seriously underpaid. How are you getting your work? Is there some middleman or agency that's finding work for you?

What subjects are you writing about? 




 Why would you consider taking this offer? What's the point of going down in title and responsibility for a $5K bump? 

Do they offer something else that you want? Is there more opportunity at the new place? And why would you even think that you're a "self-entitled jerk" because you're unhappy that they pulled a bait and switch on you?  




 The underlying idea  is very cool. 

Scientists devise a way to record experiences and play them back. Not unlike Strange Days (1995). Some guy dies while wearing the recording headset and then the race is on to get that tape.

It's worth watching, if you've never seen it. I believe ut was Natalie Wood's last movie. 




 Brainstorm (1983)

 Approach it like it's just something they overlooked. 

"Hey Boss, I'm sorry to bring this up, but I checked the provincial overtime regulations and blah blah blah. I just wanted to bring this to your attention because we could be in trouble because it seems like we're not following them."

For a small business with few employees, they may not know all the relevant regulations. Even if it's an intentional oversight, playing it like it's an innocent mistake lets them correct the error and save face. 




 I don't think you have to mention the other job at all. You work there five days a month. What you do the rest of the time is none of their business.

Just tell the Job A boss that you've decided that driving an hour and a half to work four hours just doesn't make sense for you anymore but that you'd be willing to telecommute. Then stop talking and see what he says.

Be prepared with particulars, how they'd verify that you're working, how the work would get done, etc, but wait until asked.

Then just be polite and firm about it.

 Except that if you had a magic space drive that could give you constant, limitless 9.8m/s^2 acceleration, you'd reach near light speed in less than a year and make the 4.24 ly trip in something like five years.  




 You've made an error. The universe is not Newtonian. It is not possible to travel faster than the speed of light.

After about 354 days at 1g acceleration you've reached nearly the speed of light and traveled about half a light year. After that, you travel at close to light speed until you turn around and decelerate. 

So you spend a year traveling .5 light years. Coast at .9 C for about four years and then turn around and decelerate for a year.

That's about five years or so for a magical 1g drive to get to Proxima. 




 Any company that fires people when they give notice doesn't get notice. That's all part of the karma wheel.

Also, all commissions earned must be paid. You can take them to court if they don't.

Congratulations and good luck in your new adventure. 




 It always is. 




 You need to be compensated for any time spent on work tasks assigned to you by your employer. If they ask you to come in for a meeting on your off day, they must pay you for that. If they ask you to complete a self-evaluation form, they must pay you for that. If they expect you to study materials they provide to you so you can pass a test they give you, they must pay you for that.

In my job, I have a lot material to read, understand and pass tests on to remain qualified. All of the time I spend doing that is paid.

Frankly, a lot of this stuff sounds cuckoo bananas to me. I'd be looking for the exit door ASAP. 




 I don't know whether you can do the work or not, but I can tell you that everyone feels like this at one time or another. Google "Imposter Syndrome" and read up on it. It's very common.

Nobody knows everything. Everybody has to look shit up. 

Put your head down, work hard, use your brain and if you feel unsure of yourself, just fake it 'til you make it.

Good luck!  




 I loved this movie. My friends and I used quote it to each other all the time. 

"We only have sex twelve times a year"

"Once a month is not too bad"

"No, nothing all year and then twelve times in one night"

I think this ones is the list of movies that could never, ever be made today.  




 First a plum, then a banana...I think I know what he is trying to say, eh.  




 That woman was trying to sell you the Kirby Home Maintenance System. I was a Kirby salesman for a couple of months in 1986. 

Nice to see that the basic pitch hasn't changed in nearly 30 years. 




 Just tell him that vacation days are part of your compensation, just like your salary, health insurance, etc. They're not freebies that the company throws in because they like you.

If there's too much work for you to take time off, that's certainly a problem, but it's not your problem to solve. It's not right for your boss to ask you to forgo time off because there's too much work  any more than it would be right to ask you to skip a paycheck because the company had cash flow issues.

You shouldn't be thinking about snappy comebacks. You need to sit down with your boss at the beginning of the year and tell him that the company gives you X number of days a year for paid time off and you intend to use them, so when would be the best time of the year to schedule them. 




 It seems pretty dead at the moment. There was no I-Con in 2014 and probably no con in 2015.

It's very sad. My first I-Con was VII, I believe. I worked on the con for many years. And now it's gone. 




 You can look on fiverr.com and see if there are small jobs you can do for a few dollars here and there.  




 I don't know about that. I bought a cheapo Acer Chromebook and the battery life is pretty ridiculous. I can usually get eight solid hours of work out of it. 

MacBook Pro probably sucks a lot more juice, even though it has a bigger battery. 




 First, because race, as we commonly talk about it, is a social construct. There is no scientific, biological basis for the concept of race and no credible researcher in the field of human genetics talks about race.

Second, intelligence is a pretty mushy concept. How do we determine one person is more or less intelligent than another? The only tools we have are tests, all of which come with their own racial and cultural biases and very few of which have any success teasing out innate intelligence (whatever that means) from education and culture.

Third, the question has very little value, especially compared to the damage this topic has caused. 

So, anyone who really wants to talk about race and intelligence in a serious way is almost certainly ignorant, a crank or a stone racist.  




 A lot of times, breed rescue organizations will go through local shelters and take all the adoptable dogs in their specific breed. Sometimes they'll even take breed mixes. So what ends up happening is the only dogs you find are pits and pit mixes. 




 I was telling a guy at work about Blazing Saddles. He's from China and has never seen it. 

I had to speak about it somewhat indirectly because you can't say half the things in the movie at work without risking your job. 




 Not my work. My video editing skills are rudimentary at best and my artistic talent sadly sub par. 

I just found it on the interwebs and wanted to share it because I thought it was cool and I love the movie. Glad you enjoyed it. 




 This film pre-dates the PS2 by 16 years or so. 

I don't think I was that impressed with the effects when this came out. It was very different than what I was used to. 

I don't think anyone had seen anything like this before, so there was a lot of slack given. This was the first movie to use CGI visual effects for almost all of the space battle scenes.  




 I loved this movie when it came out. Saw it in the theater with my geek bros the summer after I graduated high school.

It's a little shocking that nobody has seriously talked about re-making this. It has all the YA elements those kids today seem to like. Maybe a lot of people just don't remember it or never heard of it. Maybe the rights are all tied up? Who knows.

And, of course,  who could replace the great Robert Preston? 









 No mayor is that stupid? Rob Ford? Marion Barry? And those were just two that were in the national news. 




 The value is pretty low, though. I'd guess that for this game you'd be able to pick up tix on StubHub or TicketExchange for pretty cheap.

Still, if I were a young kid and a big fan I could see doing something like this. Spend a day shoveling out the stadium with your fellow fans and then watch the game knowing that it was partially your sweat that made it possible.  




 There are no credible arguments against man-made global warming. While there's quite a bit of debate about the range of temperature change, the severity of the issue and so forth, the facts that the global climate is warming and human beings are at least somewhat responsible for it are not in dispute by any reputable scientist who actually studies the issue.

It's important also to understand that "scientist" is a pretty broad category and scientific research is broken up into fairly specialized fields. Someone who is a chemist, for example, has no more standing to talk about the scientific research with respect to climate change than any other well-educated lay person. The fact that you can line up a bunch of people who could be called scientists and get them to cast doubt on this subject means less than nothing, other than that they should know better. 




 How much do you want to bet that the guy did this on purpose to get some traffic on his website/twitter feed. There are multiple stories about this, many of them on some major sites who link back to his Twitter account.

Seems like $1,200 well spent to me.  




 Here's the trailer fot the movie.

Not a bad film, for what it was.  














 Dude, you should Google for Autopen.  









 By the way, this is Percy (Lemon Beagle pup), Charlie (Great Pyrenees) and Samson (Great Pyrenees Mix). 




 To answer your direct question, no, you're not an asshole. You've been doing this job for a year without title or compensation. It's more than reasonable to ask for both. If this wasn't a family situation, nobody would even bat an eye.

Obviously there's a question about timing, but when would be good timing? Are you really expected to wait around until he passes away and then a respectful interval afterwards? That could be years.

And really, after all that, there's no guarantee that they don't find another relative to take over the production manager job. It's a family business. That's how they roll. My wife went without a raise for years because the family-owned company she worked for was short on funds. Not so short on funds that they would get rid of the owner's husband's job, which was essentially a no-show.

Whatever they decide to give you, accept it graciously. Then get your resume together and start looking for a new job. 









 That's awesome. Thanks! 




 My understanding is that the major actors in the film were mislead and not informed of the porn content of the film. The unsimulated sex acts were shot separately from the main action of the film and edited in. 




 The songwriter royalty from an iTunes purchase is roughly 9 cents. That means that Spotify made him the same amount of money as about 140,000 iTunes song sales. If you assume that the average iTunes purchaser listens to their song about a hundred times, that's about the same number of "spins" for the same amount of money.  
























 It's based on web browsing stats, so probably not. 




 Can't someone just put a bullet in Teddy already? The man is just too stupid to live. 




 Papazian appeared, disguised as a human being. He checked quickly to make sure that his head was on right. "Nose and toes the same way goes," he reminded himself, and that was how it was.

All of his systems were go. His psyche was soldered firmly to his pineal gland, and he even had a small soul powered by flashlight batteries. 









 I have a couple of XP machines left, but nothing I use for anything vital. 

At work they won't let any machine running XP connect to the network at all, not even the guest WiFi. 









 Generally, if you do any work (paid or unpaid) while you are on unemployment you must report that and your unemployment payments will be reduced. In New York it's 1/4 off your weekly check for any day you work, no matter how much time during the day you spend working.

Not to mention that, under the FLSA, any work you do for an employer must be paid. You can not work for free.

On the other hand, you could turn this into a networking opportunity and use your old work e-mail address to ask your old clients if they have any positions open.

Really, this just sounds like a bad idea all around. 




 And I think that's part of the problem. If you have a combined universe you're going to want to save the best characters for the movies and the TV universe becomes a second class operation with the left over characters.  




 More to the point, AOS spent a lot of season one spinning its wheels while waiting for Winter Soldier to hit the theater.  




 Go watch the episodes of Agents of SHIELD that aired prior to Winter Soldier and you have your answer.

Trying to connect the two universes would hamstring one or the other or both. Having them separate lets each universe do the types of stories that suit their medium without having to worry about continuity with the other.  









 Seriously. Asians make up 4.8% of the US population. African Americans are 13.1%. Asians make up 14.5% of the shows viewership while African Americans make up 14.9%.

 I'm not opposed to movies that are sad or have a sad ending per se, I'm just not very interested in movies where that seems to be the whole point. 

This is a somewhat trite example, but I have no interest in seeing Marley and Me either.

 My experience with Kirby was 28 years ago, so take this with a that caveat.

When I was hired as Kirby salesman, I was promised a small base salary with commissions. I never received any salary and  I'm pretty sure they didn't pay me all the commission owed when I quit. I sold four units in the six weeks I worked there and was paid a total of $300 plus some gas money.

The units are very expensive. It was over $900 when I was selling them back in 1986. I hear they're close to $3000 now. That's a huge ask for a dirt sucker. You can get a top of the line Dyson for 20% of that. 

When I was hired, I was promised training and guidance for the first four weeks as I shadowed an experienced salesman. I went out on my own after being with the company for two days. 

There are people who make a lot of money selling these things. And, in all fairness, the lessons I learned going into people's houses and pitching a $900 vacuum cleaner two or three times a day for those six weeks have served me well in my various jobs since then. 




 Can't say that I was too excited about this. By the end, the show had become a sad parody of itself, but it is nice to see the guys back together. 




 Why are you concerned about what's legal or not? Why would anyone take a job like that? Why would you work for a company that would offer a job like that? It's insane.

Figuring a three hundred mile distance (five hours at 60MPH) between both cities, you'd be spending over a $100 a week in gas alone, assuming you have a decent car and gas prices don't go back up. You'd put over 75k miles on your car in the span of a year.

Seems to me that somebody at this company is trying to cheap out, hiring one engineer to fill in at both locations instead of hiring one for each. 
 









 Yeah, I'm pretty sure that modifying your hourly pay on a week-to-week basis based on how many hours you work so that your weekly pay remains the same is not in any way legal.

 What's the point of solar in space?  I get that you can get power 24/7 instead of worrying about day/night cycles and weather here on Earth plus you get better efficiency , but isn't  going to be cheaper to just build more solar panels and some kind of energy storage here on the ground than launch a huge solar power station out of the gravity well and then maintain it in orbit? 




 I recently binged the entire series and I think it holds up pretty well.

There's a lot of meh in seasons 1 and 2, but I think you can say that about any of the Star Trek series. Once you get to season 3 things are really clicking and season 4 was very enjoyable.

I bailed out the first time around after season 2. In retrospect, I should have kept with it.

The finale was terrible, though.  




 Nicely done.

 Before the the whole FEC thing came down, my plan was to pick up a used LG G2 on eBay, once that model became available for transfer, and retire my old Galaxy S2, which has given me good service, but is getting a bit long in the tooth.

Then I figured I'd wait a bit after the new year, figuring there would be a lot of used phones for sale after people got their new shiny for X-Mas. Well, that was a mistake.

So, what to do now? Is there some resolution for this in the pipeline? As far as I can tell, my only decent option now is to wait or buy a new device from Ting.  

I really don't want to switch to GSM. My workplace has Sprint repeaters and I get excellent service.

 Song Of The Sea. 

What a lush and beautiful film. Every scene in the movie was like a painting and the story was sad and haunting. A little too sad for my six year-old, who likes her films to be more upbeat.

 I saw it today at the Cinema Arts Centre in Huntington and the place was sold out. Makes me wonder why it didn't get a wider release. 




 I think I actually used to know that. Gotta love the Golden Age.

 In science it often happens that scientists say, 'You know that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken,' and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion.

Verbal directives from the partners mean nothing. 














 I loved it when it was on, but back in the 80's there was a real shortage of SF/Fantasy/Genre shows so we  tended to latch on to whatever they deigned to show us. I loved the 80's Buck Rogers show, which has little to recommend it these days except Erin Gray in skin-tight spandex outfits.

GAH is a show very much of its time. It has problems common to superhero shows of that period including a lack of super villains and terrible VFX.

I'd give it a few episodes if you're interested.

 MIT reportedly wanted him to serve some jail time as deterrent to someone else abusing their open computer resources to make a political point. 




 If he thought what he was doing was legal, then he should have gone to court and argued the point.

It's clear that he knew what he was doing was illegal because, instead of downloading the JSTOR files from his desk at Harvard, he went to MIT and abused their open computer resources to make his political point. 

In the process, he created no end of headaches for the network admins at MIT as well as students, faculty and researchers who had their access to JSTOR curtailed while Swartz evaded their attempts to kick him off their network.

 You handle it like you'd handle any other job where you had a falling out with your boss. Be honest about having difficulties with your supervisor without getting too specific about the gory details. Explain that, due to your interpersonal issues, you don't expect to get a good reference from them. 

If you can, you find someone, a co-worker or client, that you worked with who can give you an alternate reference for that job.

Since it was a family business, you can calmly explain without getting into to much detail, that you had a falling out with with your parent in part because you make a clean break and strike out on your own.

Best of luck to you. 




 That's neat. I didn't realize that Gotham and Rome shared the same creator. Gotham certainly has its issues, but I'm enjoying it overall and given how great Rome was, it gives me some hope for the future of Gotham.

Interestingly enough, I saw the parallels between Gotham's Bruce Wayne and Rome's Octavian right from the beginning. Gotham may run into the same issue that Rome did if they decide to time jump and replace David Mazouz.

 




 Seems like a good lineup, although I'm not a big fan of any iteration of Hawk and Dove.

Disappointing not to see Cyborg and Beast Boy in the lineup, but making either of those characters look halfway decent on a TNT budget is probably nigh impossible.

Not that this was ever going to happen anyway, but I guess that ends any possibility of another Birds of Prey TV show.  




 What did your boss say when you told him how much the recruiter was taking? 

If I were you, I'd go back to the recruiter and tell them you want a 30% bump effective immediately or you're going to start looking for new work and you're going to tell the client exactly why. I doubt they want to queer the relationship with such a valuable client.
