 Metamucil FTW! 




 more beanz! 




 1 thing I don't see mentioned about 4HB is how cutting out dairy has affected people...for me it was a life-changer.  I've been a huge milk drinker all my life but also suffered from gross psoriasis on my scalp, elbows, and knees.  I'd say within a month of starting 4HB, I was completely psoriasis free.  All those years that docs had me on creams, steroids, lotions, whatever....crazy. 




 if 2 glasses of red wine per night is ok - I'm calling 2 beers a night ok too... 









 Amazing. 




 SKYDART FTW!!

You had me at "oh my Cthulhu" 




 oh stop it. 




 \m/ 




 FTW - Fuck The World! 




 I made a girl vomit w/ a fart once. 









 Man, I never talk about it....when my daughter was 2, I was out front flipping my 800lb strongman tire in front of the garage.  I had been drinking w/ friends and was showing off.  I was just finishing a flip whe I saw my daughter out of the corner of my eye run right under the tire just a fraction of a second before it smacked down on the concrete.  She would have been crushed to death.  That was 8 years ago. 



















 Vermiculite. 




 Slater's 









 I'd say 700-800lbs 




 awesome! 




 totally. 




 yeah, strongman or powerlifting, but folks here seem to enjoy the pics...and really it's for anyone wanting to get stronger.  Thanks for posting Kenny! 




 NorCal here. 




 Yes, unloaded w/ just the tires it's only around 150 lbs. 




 The Log 




 Where you at? 




 48" stone platform....will now be 48" stone coffin- thanks! 




 we call it the ugly yoke....great for yoke presses and awkward yoke runs... 




 awesome man thanks! 




 most stones you see here were inherited from past competitions, but we've made many ourselves using Slater's stone molds...

then just buy your concrete and get after it! 




 a lot of technique involved in stone lifting. 




 looks awesome! practice those events - 700lb yoke for 75ft sounds BRUTAL!! 




 like anything else, just watch your form and listen to your body! 




 awesome!  Shouldering a 235lb stone is no joke! 




 a friend bought it from an old Navy guy - they were piled up in his front yard. 




 I started w/ a tire - any place that has big tires will be happy to get rid of one.  Then take it home...and flip it. 




 330 stone...

the grass gets mowed w/ stones, sleds, chains, and tires... 




 Thanks 




 thanks...yup, me a couple of years back 




 Some of my equip there but mostly a friend of mine...I have many bodybuilder friends come out to The Field for a day of training.  It's always good to switch things up...whatever your goals are. A 180lb stone would be awesome...it's hard to train for much volume w/ a 300+ lb stone.  




 Thanks man! 




 I was thinking the same...give me 10 years or so.  He's already the biggest 1st grader around. 




 You'd be surprised, not everyone in strongman...is strong.  You can still train light.   




 Thanks! 




 700lb drag...

 Thanks! Nautical links...50lbs per. 




 Atlas stones from 250 - 400lbs...I think my son is on the 360 there...

 man I love bandcamp - it's given me a new resurgence in love for metal - it's like it was 30 years ago - just browsing the metal section and seeing a tape w/ a killer cover and going for it...can you link me so I can follow you on Bandcamp? 




 NICE! 




 nice, the fam and I may be in!

 This has been one of the most enjoyable reading/listening experiences I've ever had.  As I read this book, I would listen to the albums I was reading about in real time on Spotify.  I could hear the evolution of metal as I read.  I did a quick search here and didn't see this book pop up so I wanted to recommend it to my fellow Shredditors.

 I recently picked up Ultimo Mondo Cannibale / Faceless and  Horror Of The Zombies on vinyl from Hells Headbangers on a whim - so glad I did - awesome pioneering stuff! \m/ 




 awesome man, just saw the SF show - CARCASS!!! 




 yea good point - have you heard Vastum though? 




 nice, I might have to make that my next show! and when did Oaktown become such a fucking hipster-fest? I went to the Vastum record release show w/ Christian Mistress at First Church of the Buzzard a few weeks back and it was ridiculous! 




 love Carach! dude, just looked at the line-up for that show - gonna be awesome! 




 dude that's gonna be fucking brutal!!  I just recently picked up a WarpVomit cassette from 20buckspin on a whim - bru-tal.  \m/ 




 Worldwide Plagues Tour w/ Sabaton opening for Iced Earth May 3 in San Francisco - never seen Iced Earth but I can't wait to see Sabaton again!  What's the next metal show you're going to see?

\m/ 




 a great highlighter moment from the book...

""Me and () had been awake for a pretty long time, drinking, and cutting ourselves, and the whole house we were in was full of vomit and blood."" 




 "Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult" was one of the best reading experiences I've ever had.  As I read, I would listen to the album/band I was reading about on Spotify in real time and I could hear the evolution of metal as I read - I highly recommend it! 




 "let us pray."
 




 "how much can you bench?" 




 saw them in SF last night - amazing show! 




 seeing them tonight in SF! 




 20buckspin FTW! 




 saw it on the top list - listening now - nice!

 October 31 debut album - The Fire Awaits You

 Sonicare...hands-down. 




 we got married at Garden Valley Ranch - I don't hear it mentioned often and it's really a gorgeous place.

http://www.gardenvalley.com/ 




 YIKES! 




 yet another great discovery for me from Hell's Headbangers :"Probably one of the most wanted old school death/thrash albums of the 90s. Originally released by Euronymous' label Deathlike Silence, 'The Awakening' is a slab of unholy metal violence brought back to life by Osmose Productions, and featuring bonus tracks from the legendary Uppsala gig. Here's your chance to grab a piece of underground history before it disappears into the dark again..." 









 MANIMAL! 




 finally tried it and had explosive diarrhea for 3 days...

 I must say, I avoided it for years thinking it a hipster-haven, but a buddy recently came down from Portland and took me there for a Pliny, and I'm totally sold - refilling my growler whenever I can. 




 I always picture Jim Carrey dancing to this song when I hear it. 




 just a bummer - that trail is beautiful once you get past downtown...

You are now an official backer of BurtoNZ bakery. Time to tell the world about it! 




 KROKUS! 




 funny, I haven't been in years but it's one of the first places I though of as well.  Do they still do their jug-wine on Sundays? 




 kept me up too - had to close the window....was right behind our house from like 2:30 - 4:00 or so... 




 wow. 




 I love that trail/bike path! 




 $8.99 lunch buffet? 




 totally amazing - I'm usually broken for the rest of the day after a lunch buffet there simply because I cannot stop! 




 thanks all - bummer, I had high hopes for an amazing meat-fest! 









 I was in the middle of the forest in Napa State Park and saw the flashes - crazy! 




 I was camping in a yurt at Napa State Park...it was absolutely insane...truly awesome in the literal sense of the word.  I too saw what appeared to be lightning - weird!
