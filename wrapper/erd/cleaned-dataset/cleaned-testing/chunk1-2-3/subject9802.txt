 If there was, I guarantee that not a single attractive man on there is actually a virgin and is there just to pick up chicks they can deflower. 




 Tech support associates see that kind of shit all the time. They'll laugh about it behind the scenes and then forget it the next day when something weirder happens. I used to work for Apple and this was a common occurrence.

 I help rich old people with their travel plans... Visas, itinerary advice and my personal favorite: "is there a hair dryer in all of my hotels?" 




 Kale. All of the kale. I buy it frozen and put it in soups, stir fries, smoothies, etc... Also, garlic and spices as flavoring and I refuse to buy junk food. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but frozen grapes are a great alternative to popsicles and ice cream. 




 All in good fun ;) 




 Poutine fucking rocks. 




 I am prescribed Adderall. 




 Ha, that is pretty awesome, considering I'm a Jew. 




 Playing devil's advocate... I can understand her question, but that doesn't make the question at all okay. If she was dressed provocatively, sure, she is more at risk of harassment... Should she be harassed REGARDLESS of what she is wearing? Abso-fucking-loutely not. I would be pissed, too, but I'd see it as an opportunity to educate your girlfriend on why that kind of thinking perpetuates that kind of problem rather than just getting confrontational. 




 Tell the difference between "should of" and "should have" 




 My mother is bipolar and an alcoholic. She abused me growing up until I was 14 and reported her to my therapist. I went into the state's custody and bounced around from home to home. It was hell and I was completely fucked up from it but I became stronger as a result and after a LOT of hard work and seeking therapy/medication/help and not holding grudges or pointing fingers, I'm starting to really like who I've become. It isn't easy because I'm a very sensitive person and certain comments and events will trigger knee-jerk reactions where I can act emotionally or get angry at someones insensitivity but I think if I didn't persevere, I'd be a completely different and much sadder person...

 It shouldn't if your using the right stuff! Try making a conditioning mask that you leave in your hair... Perhaps a raw honey and avocado mask left in your hair for a few hours will help. 




 I meet amazing people all the time just by being open and not intrusive.... Just the other night I met someone who I talked to for 3 hours and he told me "I'm telling you things I don't even tell my closest friends!"
I just am really open, honest and curious about people and what they do or what makes them tick, so asking about their life and being genuine has always been what works for me. 
I also draw or write whenever I sit at a bar, which usually instigates people to inquire what I'm doing and it just kind of goes from there... 




 Believe it or not, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, etc are all fruits, despite being regarded as veggies. 
Vegetables are basically lettuces, root vegetables like carrots, etc as their seeds aren't contained/protected by the fruit (save for a few examples like strawberries where the seeds are outside) 




 It's $28 for 4 fl. oz... I believe $90 is for the 16 oz.

e: It's so dense and rich that it really only requires a small amount of conditioner. I used to use it when I got it for free when I worked in body care and it made my hair feel like bunny rabbit hair. It is amazing. 




 I doubt it will affect you any differently besides psychologically... If you're worried about it when you take lsd, you're probably going to really worry about it when you're tripping which could cause you to have a bad trip 




 [This is pretty great, albeit expensive...](http://www.johnmasters.com/hr.htm)

Also, try not shampooing your hair except for once a week or less, and only using conditioner. You can rinse your hair with raw apple cider vinegar (1 tablespoon to 1 cup water) and massage it into your hair and let it sit for a few minutes, rinse with water and apply conditioner... Shampoo strips your hair of natural oils which causes your scalp to try to compensate for the lost oils and also the shampoo just dries out your hair follicles...

 Tetsuo: the iron man? 




 My father was arrested in 1988 for being the leader of an Israeli cocaine ring. I think the story about his lifestyle and subsequent arrest would make an interesting story. My mom was also a model and a bipolar alcoholic and I ended up in foster care after 14 years of abuse and witnessed a lot of fucked up stuff in the system... I've always joked how cool it would be as a movie/documentary, even though growing up really sucked...

 Awww, the poor little guy! I genuinely think, while a lot of cats don't form emotional bonds to their owners in the way that people assume dogs do, cats that have gone through significant trauma and were rescued really are capable of recognizing it. I think it's cute that you gave him his tail and he tried to get cleaned up for you. You're a good cat mom!  




 What a pretty cat! Do you know her/his breed? 




 Definitely went to the vet, hahaha... That would be incredibly inhumane of me to perform surgery on my cat.

 He will be four in february, so here's hoping he sticks around! He eats better than I do so he might outlast me! 




 He is doing very well! He was 9 pounds at his sickest and now he is a healthy 13 pounds (which for his size is appropriate). He also never meowed or made eye contact when he was at his sickest but now he is quite talkative and is a big happy goofball :) 









 You look stunning!!!!  




 That's reassuring! I am definitely impatient when it comes to seeing results, but it's good to know I don't have to do some crazy regimen either, I guess... I don't want to become obsessive with fitness.

 Yep! I remember refusing to participate in swim class in high school and my gym teacher made me do laps walking around the pool. He also gave me a VHS of [My First Mister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E24SGpVrs-s) because the girl in it reminded him of me. In retrospect, it was kind of creepy that he put that much thought into it, and the title is kind of wtf. 




 Note the fanny pack in the first photo... I don't even know what to say about those earrings, either. Heh, I remember he used to joke around and wear my **scrunchies** and jokingly call himself "Tina" in order to mess with my cousin and me... How he turned out to be a *relatively normal* human being is beyond me.

He also was diagnosed with [vitiligo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo) when he was a freshman in high school. He used to get picked on a lot because he wore makeup to cover the blotches. He was able to stop the progression of it by doing radiation, I believe. By the time he graduated, he was one of the most popular kids in high school. Complete 180. 




 I thought it would never happen. I still feel like that frumpy little girl who got picked on constantly... Thank you!  




 Thank you! :) 









 I did! The fist photo you can kind of see them. Derp.

 Bullet is a solid rye, even if r/whiskey has differing opinions, you can't "disagree" with someone's palate. This is helpful for that reason especially! 




 This is in Boston. Everything is expensive and nothing makes sense.  




 This is in Boston. Everything is expensive here :/ 




 Awesome, thank you! High west campfire is great. Rye is my favorite of the spirits so this is really awesome advice, thanks! 




 Thanks a bunch! This is good information :) 




 Haha this is a fantastic response. You hit the nail on the head with your assessment. I always prefer rye for my manhattans and scotch to sip. I'll have to think of a few more options because I'm not fond of very "sweet" whiskeys so I appreciate the direction to focus on :D 




 Thank you so much! This is incredibly helpful! I've tried quite a few, but honestly ony can remember about one or two from most categories as I wasn't drinking them with the intention of selling it, heh. I really appreciate the feedback and will keep it in mind until I have my own go-to's as ammunition :) 




 Hey all!

I just got a new job as a cocktail waitress at a bar specializing in whiskey/whisky... A lot of patrons will ask for suggestions on recommendations for a good bourbon/scotch/rye of varying conditions/batches/etc.

I was curious what r/whiskey thought about some solid go-to's and why.

[Here is the full spirits list for anyone curious.](http://www.saloondavis.com/documents/Saloon_Bourbon8.9.13.pdf) It changes often, so anything outside of this is encouraged, too, but try to stick to the list if you can :)

Thanks! 




 A lot of people seem to think they're crows, but they are actually starlings! The collective noun for starlings is called a murmuration. [Check out this really awesome video of them in a flock!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRNqhi2ka9k)

 came here to say this. It's too perfect! 




 Just made a ton of flash cards and have been taking notes and making sure I'm pronouncing things right (like Cynar for example). 

As far as customer service goes, I have that in the bag and I know I'll kill it in that department; I just need to make sure I don't fuck up my drinks!

I am going into the bar before they open today to do a little practice. I'll report back after. Thanks a bunch! 




 Awesome advice, thank you!!! 




 The bar is more upscale than that, which is why I'm intimidated...

http://www.saloondavis.com 




 Thank you! This is a great help!

Also, how do bartenders usually memorize so many drinks? Do you normally study it when first starting out or did a lot of it come with practice?  




 Great job! 




 This comes off more creepy and stalkerish than awesome. I feel bad for celebrities sometimes. Cool photo either way, OP. Workaholics is great... Maybe next time take a mental picture when you're in a situation like that? 




 So, I just started a new job as a hostess at a local restaurant and not even a week in I was asked if I would be interested in cocktail waitressing. I have server experience and a really great analytical memory, so I enthusiastically agreed... Cut to yesterday, I show up for my shift and was pulled aside from the (lead?) bartender and asked if I was interested in bartending. I was honest about my lack of experience which he seemed fine with (he said he prefers training new bartenders over acclimating existing bartenders with attitudes). I am heading in on Sunday to do a little training and I'm extremely nervous. I've been in myriad positions where I've had to learn on the fly, and the staff seems to really like me here but I can't help but feel like they're insane for asking me two weeks into my new job.  
  

Any help or advice on how to kick ass and learn fast would be appreciated, along with any useful tips that any new bartender should know. There's a possibility this is just a trial run and won't end up with an actual bar position, but I want to be prepared for all possible outcomes.  
  


**TL;DR:** I was asked if I wanted to be a bartender with no previous bartending experience because my managers think I am organized and a fast learner (I presume). Please help with tips/opinions in any way!  
  

Thanks for reading :) 




 Seriously, you have helped me get through SO many shitty days at my horrible job. I put a post-it on my desk that says "You didn't get mauled by a bear. You can get through this day!!!"

As much as that sounds like a back handed compliment, I read your whole thread and your attitude and just overall sense of fight has seriously been such an incredible inspiration. Thanks for coming back to check in!!! :D
