 I don't know any satanic music... 




 a system based on rules and works to get you 'whatever the goal is': enlightenment, nirvana or salvation in the case of Christianity 




 they're not exactly rules, it's a little more complicated than that

and it's a place holder title, atm anyways 




 one of the criteria for porn is:

The work as a whole must lack "serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific values".

so porn is meaningless other than for sexual purposes 




 it is compelling, because suicide is a popular 'solution' as well as other various coping methods and your testimony can be used to demonstrate the joy, love and hope in the cross.

if it's not compelling, then it is not convincing enough that there is a God 




 you say you were raised Christian, you need to be more specific

You are taking a theological approach to this, which I don't recommend.

What I do is understand that you should start over anew and go back to basics: what and why Jesus did what he did and go from there. 




 I honestly couldn't think of title and I just needed this post for a different post, that's all

it definitely needs a better title, sorry 




 not referring to those genres

I mean what I say 




 there are only 2 commandments as rules (there are other commandments):

**Matthew 22:37-40; Mark 12:30-31; Luke 10:27** 
1) Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind
2) Love your neighbor as yourself
______________________________________________

**1 Corinthians 6:12, 10:23** "I have the right to do anything," you say--but not everything is beneficial. "I have the right to do anything"--but not everything is constructive.

**1 Corinthians 6:19**
Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;

**1 Corinthians 10:31; Colossians 3:17** whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.

**1 Timothy 4:4** For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving

**Philippians 4:8** whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things.
_____________________________________________
**Matthew 5:17**
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.

Background: when Jesus came to die on the cross, it is to take up our sin, only because he kept the law at full (thus no sin in him), and bury into the grave and we no longer live in sin but we are free from sin because Jesus resurrected from the dead.

So in everything that we do it is based on discernment and conviction not based on rules.
_____________________________________________
note: was with anything, there will be exceptions
examples:

1)tattoos:
-if you are getting one to spite or rebel against someone that is not a good reason to get one you might hurt yourself (no longer love yourself)
-you can honor God by getting a tattoo and with right intentions

2) (secular)music:
-songs with positive messages (who says by Selena Gomez, Skyscraper by Demi Lovato), love songs can help you lover yourself or others, your neighbors
-songs that have no meaning but can be fun (anaconda by Nicki Minaj) are just meant to be fun with right intentions
-satanic music cannot be redeemed by God, avoid these

3) homosexuality
-it's the sexual act, not the marriage
-it provides no (evolutionary) advantage, it is meaningless, lust and flesh therefore it is not honorable for God
-STDs, and general sexual consquences

4) Porn
-lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific values, therefore cannot be redeemed for the honor of God

5) Drugs
-obvious

etc.

In conclusion, it is not a matter whether it is a sin or not but what your intentions are and discernment (exceptions to those who have clouded judgments and outliers). Sin is transgression of the law (Exodus, Leviticus and Deuteronomy) and you are free from those but it is a matter whether it is beneficial to you, others or God or not. No, you cannot just name something n honor of God and hope to redeem it.

**1 Samuel 16:7b**
People look at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart." 
























 I used to

but the problem is no lane presence and/or how will you get past all the cc 




 it now comes to the point whether you can reliably apply the cc, correctly

for example, tf's stun card takes time 




 it's possible but then it comes to the question to whether you can stun kat reliably 




 the support role cannot just be filled by anyone

all adcs are viable, but not every adc can fit into just any team comp

some people try to be unconventional with adc lulu, adc ahri, adc kennen, etc 




 oops 




 not all of them are viable, so the number is actually lower

compared to adc which have 18
it makes sense at least 15 should be enough 




 it's a root, not hard CC...

even then, it does not stop kat ult... 




 simply put: there are not enough champions to fill in the role and it gets tedious trying to rotate among them (I counted 14 using my definition) when there isn't a lot to begin with. you can only play leona so much before you go crazy

the way I define support is: can you stop kat ult? (reliably, such as in the case of morgana, is a different story though)
this is what honestly is keeping the support role from being able to fit in other champions. if we just nerfed (preferably delete) katarina then this will be better.

1) traditional supports:
-alistar
-blitzcrank
-braum
-janna
-leona
-lulu
-nami
-sona
-soraka
-thresh
-taric
total: 11

2) mages that went support
-annie
-fiddlesticks
-morgana
-vel'koz
-zyra
total: 5

3) situational supports or those that fail to meet the criteria (usually no hard cc)
-lux
-kayle
-karma
-zilean
-all other mages 




 Saying her spear does less damage is not exactly fixing. The spear can still do a lot: if it used to be 90% of health it's 70% of health, so that reduction is not meaningful, plus she can just go in and execute. She's strong range and melee.

These are not counterplay:
Dodge the spear,
Cc her,
She has to put herself at 'risk'(what about a champion like talon?) 
























 or she can just jump to you?? 




 people insist this as a form of counter play lol

you can say this about every melee champion 




 they removed his silence (do you not read?)

also, she could be last pick (assuming not banned) 




 not all champions in the other 4 roles must have some form of cc to be a decent team comp

for example, people would just go that once thresh is picked, he's all the cc they would need

and you're the one that's incompetent 




 I'm not entirely sure on this, some sources say that the pillar doesn't

how can cait stop a kat ult?? 




 This is about her ult, only

here is a list of champions that CAN'T stop kat's ult:

-Akali
-Caitlyn
-Corki
-Mundo
-Eve
-Ez
-Fiora
-Gankplank
-Graves
-Jinx
-Karma
-Karthus
-Kat
-Kayle
-Khazix
-Kog
-Leblanc (since she lost silence)
-Lucian
-Lux
-Yi
-Miss Fortune
-Mord
-Nasus
-Nidalee
-Nunu
-Olaf
-Rengar 
-Rumble
-Ryze
-Sivir
-Swain
-Talon (since he lost silence)
-Teemo
-Trundle (?)
-Tryndamere
-Twitch
-Varus
-Vlad
-Yorick
-Zed
-Zilean
total: 41/123

champions with UNRELIABLE cc:
-Ahri
-Amumu (must use bandage toss to stop her; his ult does not stop kat)
-Anivia (ice ball is slow, not sure about wall)
-Ashe
-Brand
-Cass
-Elise
-Fizz
-Gnar (must be mega gnar to stop her)
-Heimerdinger
-Irelia
-Kennen
-Morg
-Nocturne
-Shaco
-Shyvana
-Syndra?
-Twisted Fate
-Viktor
-Xerath
-Xin?
-Yasuo
-Ziggs
-Zyra
total:24/123

a grand total of 65/123 champions that cannot be picked

conclusion: just by picking kat (some might argue akali, yi and fiora but roots do stop these champions, unlike kat), you invalidate half the champion pool. Not many of the adcs (not everyone is gonna pick ashe, vayne, tristana or quinn) can stop kat's ult and because adc is necessary, we only get to choose 4 out of 58 champions and it's not even 58 as some are not viable (for example: zac, urgot and galio)
and yes she has high win rate and high banning status (especially in korea, don't know about NA):
http://www.op.gg/statistics/champion/katarina/

my problem with kat, not that I lost to one, is that she is the reason you cannot just pick any champion into any role and well forces picks (mainly support since the support is required to have CC just so you can stop katarina) where as sometimes I want to support with zilean and karma, for example but cannot.
 




 how is it wrong...

-ashe
-caitlyn
-corki
-ezreal
-draven
-graves
-jinx
-lucian
-kalista
-kog'maw
-miss fortune
-quinn(if you are going to indicate this one is not then fine it's still a total of 15)
-sivir
-tristana
-twitch
-urgot
-varus
-vayne 




 taric (maybe he is viable?), alistar (better in solo lane or jungle) and lulu(better in solo lane), 
blitzcrank and soraka are binary or situational picks, for example you wouldn't ALWAYS pick blitz, 
thresh (this one is a mix: some will say he's not viable, others will argue he's still relevant; I've just never seen a good one since the last sets of nerfs)

fiddlesticks got nerfed out of viability 




 veigar is wasted as a support

and did you not read, karma and zilean are not good picks (despite utility) because they lack cc

so that's 15 and then, not every support is viable so it's less than 15
