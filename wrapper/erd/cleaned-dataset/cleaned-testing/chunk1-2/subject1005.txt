 "Kill Bill Siren" was awesome. These seriously make my week. You should do them for Better Call Saul!!! That subreddit would be extremely grateful.  




 crazy bastard 




 What I hoped for this post: something other than the obvious.  




 I didn't find this scene funny, but the fact that you did kills me.  




 Bill from Kill Bill. Not saying the five point palm exploding heart technique sucks....but he's a dude we have waited through TWO movies to see die. And he falls. On the grass. Cool. 




 Jump to Conclusions App.  




 There has to be some angle in this decision. Surely he's not ACTUALLY thinking he's above Rick's group and their decisions. He still carries the guilt of the people he left to die AND he knows he would be dead if it wasn't for Grimes and Co. So I'm thinking there's another angle that we just aren't seeing yet. Thoughts? 




 These are my new friends; the Van Buren Boys.  




 No dough....no show. 




 I seriously cant stop singing that song. "Arizona moon is shining" 




 "Great! You shot the invisible swordsman!" 




 Goodnight Ned. 




 Infamous is when you're more than famous. This guy El Guapo isnt just famous....he's INfamous.  




 Ha! My bad. I'm in.  




 I think he means that if you- SHUT UP!! 




 Tell us we will die like dogs.  




 Can I have your watch when you are dead? 




 I saw this movie as a kid and absolutely loved it. Watched again as an adult and still am drawn to quoting it and singing along. Chevy Chase, Steve Martin and Martin Short are perfect in this movie. I don't see this movie mentioned very much, but I recommend it to ANYONE who hasn't seen it.  




 I gave you a downvote.  




 I think you'd be in serious trouble if this subreddit ever found out where you live.  




 Hahaha!! That is exactly what I was looking for. The Lost Boys is so damn good btw.  




 I wasn't referring to famously misquoted lines. But personal lines that you just misheard and said wrong for a time.  









 After going through OPs post history, I have concluded he is 12 years old and needs to find another site to be annoying on.  




 I think you overestimate redditors and their love for posting absolutely anything; even if they literally just read the same post. 




 Hollywood's best kept secret in transforming characters: glasses  




 Greg Kinnear. Every time. Always. Forever. Captain Amazing.  




 Because Andrew here is very interested in pursuing a career in the custodial arts. 




 What're you referring to exactly? I feel like the obvious answer is 'no' and maybe you just got unlucky and saw a bunch of slow-song trailers in a row.  
























 Totally. I'm really enjoying these! 




 Longest yet! 




 I love this one. 




 or A Walk to Remember Me Myself and Irene 




 What is the longest title you can make using movie titles. 

For example: License to Kill Billy Elliot  




 I know its for comedic value, but its so overdone, that yes, it needs to stop. A joke is only funny so many times. 




 "Kids get scared." "Whats there to be scared of?" "No, no, I didn't say I was scared." "I didn't say you were scared." "I know." 




 In Carl's defense, he's always liked that word "gargantuan." Its so rare he ever afforded the opportunity to use it in a sentence.  




 Don't forget the constant one true dog posts.
 




 Yeah, and Bryan Cranston would play everyone. Every single role.  




 Or the OVERUSAGE of "plot armor." 




 Yeah, agreed. I think this sub is willing to post even the most absurd "theory" just for the sake of posting something. I don't think anyone honestly believes there are Ms.  




 This isn't exclusive to this sub, but I see it a lot on here: When someone comments with just "this" 




 Same with Morgan. They've made it clear that Morgan will return in some fashion but every episode that passes, Reddit tried to create clues that lead to Morgan. Knock.It.Off. 




 Actually that's a good call. I was thinking about others roles too and I'm inclined to agree with you.  




 Yeah this gets old fast. It's even worse when they are right about something though because then they feel like they have a license to FORESHADOW CONSTANTLY.  




 I'm over reading about the Rick/Shane transformation personally, and every comment in regard to Eugene being "That's classified." What're yours? 




 I don't exactly agree, but this is the kind of answer I was looking for. Actors who could play each other's roles convincingly enough. Thanks.  




 Not necessarily looking for doppelgangers, but actors/actresses who could play each others roles. 




 Don't Judge me.  




 YEAH! Best level in the game. I can never quite make it all the way through without shooting the scientists and failing the mission :/ It's just too much fun.  




 I don't know why it is being downvoted either, BUT if we're talking Bond....Peirce Brosnan hanging upside down and punching the Russian in the face while he's on the can in Goldeneye is probably better.  




 There's Something About Mary also comes to mind. 




 Detroit Rock City is such a great movie. So much fun to watch.  




 Nothing off limits. What do you got? 




 Well I want you to try....rearry...hard to get a missile.  




 My dad says that Tom Hanks looks like his mouth was ripped out and then taped back on. I don't know what he means by this, but thought you should know.  




 I take pleasure in downvoting assholes who just post "this." 




 This movie has my all-time favorite trailer.
