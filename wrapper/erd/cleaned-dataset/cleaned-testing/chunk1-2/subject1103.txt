 Don't tell me you're  16 year old, because if you were then I'd  get angry. A day old infant isn't depressed. You probably fell from grace around 7 years old. So if you are 16, you had angst for about 9 years. It will go away if you change your attitude about life - irony. Good luck.  




 Did the guy walking cause the accident? How come the other people aren't walking in the intersection and he is? Doesn't make sense.  




 That's the sad part OP. We have to suffer to the point of insanity, then one of two things happens: 1. You break and will never be the same. 2. You break and realize you need to become apathetic and figure out the sodomoty of life and play the game, take no prisoners.  




 If OP mentioned SpongeBob and the "son" has to ask why there is semi-naked people in public.  10th grade.  




 Koons? 




 loved the kid's  apathetic reactions. "I like hockey, and I don't know why", "I'm so happy right now I don't know why". Poor kids, growing with the social outcasts with the beta dad. 




 Green moose? I'm not the intended audience.  




 Makes way more sense if you watch from the beginning. I feel like that part was left out on purpose to not make him look like a huge dick. Clearly he knew exactly where he was going. 




 Why? 




 I'm not a fan of this message. Too many people work too much and dont spend time with family or kids or doing something they enjoy that's not work. What is the point of having all that money if I don't have time to spend it or enjoy time with my loved ones? 




 Mischievous Kiss in Tokyo. You'll thank me later. 




 Hey OP. This doesn't sound legal to me.  Is there some kind of legal  council? Try ombuds.  




 Don't be. Everything may not be okay, but you still got love. 




 You're the devil. : p  




  Did you know only 1% of the world is college educated? People don't want to think, if they think they will think about all the things they have to think about doing.  All they want to do is watch something to feel good about themselves, and so they give them what they want. I stopped watching TV in 2012, because once I realized my IQ went up, so did my standards. The laugh tracks infuriates me with such  passion, I get mad. I can no longer be near such a vicinity.  




 How ironic if it was the board game: Life. 




 Names Jorge.  19/m/US. I like asains and traveling. sometimes I read, I love music (understatement) and I enjoy learning languages.  




 There was this movie. All I remember  is people in a cage and a small human girl approaches  the cage and sees a little boy, the girl runs to tell her father and he comes back with a scanner and scans the boy. He's a robot, too.  




 What was step one again? I'm confused.  




 People don't fall asleep in less than half an hour?  




 I totally  agree with you, no one comes from the blank slate credit competent. However, I don't  agree on the "fuck ups" one enough can fuck your life up. E.x. 50 credit that you can't pay off.  And the traveling, it's  for the "miles" Again neophyte trying to figure shit out one 1% at a time.  




 You left everything  vauge. I'm just going to reply with a vauge answer. What ever your problem is, isn't the end of the wrold. No problem is. Cancer? Surivable. Frostbite?  Surivable.  Not being able to make friends? **NOT SURIVABLE** as humans we're  social creatures, buy an animal or get a job and hire escorts until you get confidence start meeting people who love you not for you but for who  you are. Best of luck, OP! 




 Maybe it was a perky female attendant that day? Men have fallen for worse.  




 As long as you're still willing to fight, you haven't lost yet. Failure is when you admit it. Keep working OP, I know it won't be easy, but you got to do it for your daughter.  




 Depends where you are in life. For me, I'm just starting. I use my credit to get free $$$. Welcome to America where they pay you to spend money. I got $40 in 1% rewards just buy using a credit card. I always pay in full. Post-college I'm getting a traveling card, and fly more often and get "miles" 

**tl;dr Credit is only for people who can handle it wisely**  




 Why are you here if you already know? 




 How about a barista? 




 When I was 18 I got my first credit card. No job until I was 19. My credit score is better, why? because I started 7 months ago. Time is ticking you only have about 340 months to really enjoy life. Don't wait until month 200 to get one
 Just don't get into debt. Have fun! 




 Nice headphones! I want to get the HiFiMan HE-400, but after I upgrade my car speakers ($400-1k) Same here! I'm going to apply for subway tomorrow. Good luck on your job search.  




 Hello,

My name is Jorge. I am a university student in CA. I'm going to travel to Japan this summer. I enjoy the culture and want to learn everything there is about Japan. I don't expect you to teach me anything, I'm already studying the language. I want to send gifts and receive gifts ( small items, but it's the thought that counts) I just want to make more Japanese friends. I plan on working in Japan after I graduate so I want to start now. You can either email me or snail mail me. my email is drummergeorge@aol.com   




 Take them to to the people who are starving. Offer them 10 potatoes for every head they bring to me.  




 Nice, nice. I play League. I used to have a gaming adiction, but it's mostly extinct now. Which headphones do you use?  I get out next month :( I work as a tutor as of now, btw. You like your job?  




 Vist /r/SuicideWatch if anything goes atrwy. I can answer your question, OP. I live life for romance. Everything I do in life is for the sake of love. To me happiness is being healthy and seeing a beautiful asain girl, I approach her flirt with her, let her know I want to bang the shit out of her and hopefully  not get rejected. I will always do things for love. e.x Work - love - better production 
 School - love - great time, fun memories. Home - love - cook, Clean house
 I'm just in love with life. Oh as an aspiring psychologost, I highly  recommend you find love- whether platonic or promiscuous, you need love as an individual  in order to feel like living. If you're really desperate try an escort services and after the first experience  you'll fathom. Best of luck! (also worst come to shove, please be an organ donor)  




 This is the most easiest problem to fix. All you need is to learn to how socialize and boom. Read 48 laws of power, How to make and influence friends, and 7 high habits of successful  people. By the time you finish these books, I'd  say you wouldn't  be suicidal  by July 20th. Have fun, PM if anything confuses you.  




 Nope. I used to but not anymore. What are your interests anyways? Bang any girls yet? Future goals? Best memory last week? How is the weather in your State? Been to anything cool  over there?  




 Yeah,  my closest ones from 3rd grade. Out of all of us,  I  only went to university, one went to college and the other two didn't. They have no ambition, stay at home all day. I started seeing the gap several weeks ago, but I was in denial. I realized it yesterday  when I invited them to a party at my school, I drank a little but my friends were total losers. They didn't  want to do anything.  I wanted to approach women and I did- got rejected, twice- but they didn't want to do shit besides go home. Killed my buzz. Also, it was a built up from that, always telling me about "my debt" that I'm stupid for doing  all these awesome things. I work as a tutor as of now, I go to the gym, just cardio but am going to start lifting soon. I'm an audiophile, I spend 300+ on headphones, currently saving 1k to upgrade my car speakers. Love electronic/ambient music. I don't watch TV, I abhor the laugh track, makes me furious. The TV producer tells me I'm so stupid I don't know when to laugh, what a moron. Other interests? hmmm.. I love romance a lot. I dedicated my whole life to it( platonic or promiscuous ) I love helping people, that's why I'm going into therapy.  I volunteer at a orphanage to "save the children".As far as talking to people at school, I got rejected  four times last week, so now I'm here. See, i go for the 8s and 9s, those babys are hard to crack. I got a few after me, but I know my worth. Trying to bounce back though . I do meet people at my school, but I think reddit will just falciiate  my social circle ten fold. 




 You want to be Reddit friends? My name is Jorge, I'm the same age as you. I'm in CA though. What's up.  




 I'm a heterosexual male attending a Cal State. I just realized yesterday that my friends were losers. And am looking for other friendships as of now. 

My interests: Learning Japanese (Going to Japan this summer) I know  a little french and fluent in Spanish and English. I love to read, travel and buy stuff online. I'm an audiophile; plan to practice therapy in 2017. 



**tl;dr** **Looking for people who are great socializers.** 




 You deserved  it \s 




 So you're suicidal because a girl won't talk to you? Damn, you won't live to 20.  




 I break my phones w/o a case. I can never buy this phone, I just buy a external battery case phone. 10,000mAh keeps me happy.  




  But I don't want to be manipulative or anything

You're associating manipulation from a negative cognition. But did you know a positive connotation is referred to as: persuasion? People use each other all the time, for good or bad. Relationships are exactly that. Men get the sex, woman get the security form it. It's a give and take. (This might not make sense, depends on your level of apprehension) 

Honestly, I don't think you would be able to handle it. You need to be angry or uncomfortable. Then you have passion to change. I got a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/PrXxF5k.jpg) for you OP. I can go on and on about the subject, but I just want to plant the seed and hopefully one day you'll transpire from it. Good luck! 
 




 I came up a with an analogy for you OP. Consider woman dogs. When you're little they all look strange and interesting. You want to touch them. When you have the courage to do so, some will be pleased with your touch and one day one will bite you. Now it may be an ER visit type or just a small bandage. You've been bitten OP. And you're in psychological pain. But that's the worst one. There is plenty of material on the internet to spot dogs (woman) and how to get them to wag their tail in your presence, but it's hard to find what works for you.  




 This used to happen to me. You just learn not to invest that much into it at first, since it's unpredictable. Hopefully, you'll learn from the mistake of being too attached real quick. Unrequited love is horrible. Hope you feel better, OP. 




 I went through something similar to what you went through OP, not as drastic but just as traumatic. When I was 17 I got hit by a car. I broke my neck-C-7- If it was one bone down-C-6- I would have been a quadriplegic. My mom wanted to go to court to sue the driver. But I couldn't. I told her if she did I wanted nothing to do with it. It was a moment of time where I didn't want to relive. I had my neck broken for fucks sake. I had to wear a neck brace for 3 months. Can you imagine being in high school for that duration? My friends were awesome about it, making fun of me- I liked it, it made it less threatening- but I still got looks and empathy from people. I just wanted it all to go away. I still keep the torn helmet from the crash to remind myself that life goes on. I'm not sure how old you are, but no one can force you to do anything, in the US-long as you're not incriminated. You can tell your therapist to eat shit, you're not talking. Sure, maybe the cops will be involved but so what? Plea the 5th. You don't have to say shit, if you don't want to. But don't repress that memory or else it will manifest from within. I was at peace with the accident, and so should you. Let it go, there is nothing you can do about it now. Just accept it happened and move on with your life. You're not going in that direction why look there? Keep moving forward. Good luck.  
























 How much for the books?  




 I think you meant to post this on /r/UnmadeBeds 




 Isn't entropy the best? :) Everyone should die ;)  




 MURICA! 




 comments  




 As a college student, I am successful in my studies and refer  to myself often. Every time a quarter ends, I scan all my notes/papers/projects. I then store then in two places. Online and hard drive. I delete the hard copy, and enjoy a clutter, but organized academic folders.  




 Where do you work? I want free stuff 2 




 People get this sitmiga that education is affordable. It is, if you can afford it. Since you are not a candidate for any government assistance, you should invest into to look into third parties who will give you a loan with interest. Depends what UC, but tuition at UCR is 14k a year. If you tend to graduate in 4 years, you would owe. 56k in just tuition, not including the textbooks, parking passes, misconlanious purchases. If you're poor, it's better to stick to a CC, I've seen people who were in the same situation as you only to fail the 2nd year and owe 30k in money they aren't investable anymore.  




 How much $ do you make a year?  




 Here is a smile for you young adults entering the big scary world. Titties control a man, boom that's some wisdom you learn when you're 19.  




 Can confirm, seat is too small, to really protect against such events.  




 this is why you should bleed red.  




 I thought that wearing shirts is counter productive while swimming?  




 Why is he wearing a shirt?  




 I've been studying and experimenting  on this topic for a few months now. Thanks to your suffering and cried for attention I'm reaching the end. Since you helped me, I'll  tell you something. **YOU'RE MISSING LOVE**. You don't lose yourself if you want to die, voluntarily. You need love to fill your life. From reading your capricious text, I concluded to this analysis. Make yourself look/feel good and be promiscuous or just love yourself. No bulshit. I'm a year older than you and I got my life together- give or take. I've  never been where you are unlike the miliqtoast of commentators who  have. Don't listen to the people that spiral in the circle we call: depression.  




 CA Please.  




 Pm me a pass plz.  




 I bought a nike one 2 years ago, does it really help you? 




 I eat pigs, every Friday. You're no better if you do too. I would have eaten the pig alive if I had a choice. 
 




 How was inmate #39e? 




 Such a good read. Haven't read this good  since it was only 1k. 




 Where did you buy that bag? I want it.  




 Reddit Remind me, 'Never forget" 60 hours 




 What rules? 









 I'd be happy to shit in front of that 




 I was upset about this at first. Similar when to eReaders came out, then I got one. I can't wait for theses suckers to come out!  




 In the show you were always into asain chicks. Have you ever plan on going to Japan?  




 spoliers! 




 I lost it at, "only dog I saw". 




 All we need is a Shity Bot Moderator.  




 Get zerolemon battery case. 80$ on amazon. 10,000mAH. I don't charge my phone every day, but every 2 days. Good if you're in college or use your phone for work. ( I use GPA a lot)  




 tic tac toe  




 Dear Obama,

I have my bond money now. Please set me free, now. My people need me.


Love,
Prince Nigher. 




 

This is basically what it would be like if male armor in an RPG was the same as female armor
 




 When I come home from work and see the kids waiting for me from the windows. 




 Seems like you lack discipline. I'm currently facing the same issue and that's after some insight. Assuming you're psychologically stable and all, of course. Just need to make it a habit that's all.   




 When I'm talking to a cute girl and she laughs at my jokes.  




 Love the apathy. You need to consider a program to mitigate these unwanted behaviors or thoughts.  Like life, nothing is easy. Good  luck!  




 NTIL YOU REJECT YOUR MUDMAN WAYS OUR ALLIES THE SEA LIONS WILL CONTINUE THEIR ASSAULT!!!! ALL HAIL THE ALL FATHER!!!!! 




 Coming out is my cage.  




 Everyone wants an audience. 




 Honestley, no one will care. You might be talked about if you exit violently,  e.x Elliot Rogers,  or send a suicide  letter to blink 182. But you're  here now.  so what's troubling you friend?  




 High four? :p  




 what does pronhub say??
