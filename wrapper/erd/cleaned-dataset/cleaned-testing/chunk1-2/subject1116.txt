 Pretty similar wr group in a 16 teamer, except I have Fitz instead of Cruz. I actually got Marshall and Blackmon in trade. I ended up trading Moreno Steve Smith and Broyles for those 2 plus Jerome Simpson. I feel like the trade worked out well for both sides.  




 I think it could be a misprint. Ian rappaport, on twitter, is saying that he's getting an mri on his foot. Either way we still have to wait for more info.  




 Which the week the giants come off their bye :) 




 If someone has the luxury to drop a lot of cash on fantasy football then he doesn't have much to bitch about.  




 Update on the situation: https://twitter.com/ConorTOrr/status/388765847554383872

From rotoworld:
"That's not the way it was presented to me," Coughlin said. The Giants' coach gave a "vague timeline" on Wilson's return at 3-4 weeks, although none of this really matters until Wilson gets a second opinion on his neck during Monday's visit with specialist Dr. Robert Watkins. Wilson owners should still fear the worst, but keep Wilson rostered until the Watkins results are known 




 I wouldn't say RB2 just yet.  This was the first game that the giants oline looked competent but that could just be a result of the bears defense being incompetent.  Also Andre Brown should be back from his injury after the giants bye.  




 Dude get over it.  It is just fantasy football, this on the other hand is a pretty serious and career threatening diagnosis.  Show some empathy. 









 Has the Bears run defense been this mediocre this year? 




 Shocking the VP of Officiating defends the decision by the officials. 




 Didn't Cruz benefit from this rule 2 years ago as well? I think it was against the cardinals. 




 And Randle is soooo stupid. 




 Lets hope. 




 This is my internal dilemma.  As much as I love technology, I know whatever I decide to buy will just promote a business model that includes exploiting another human being.  The only way to stop this is to just not buy from companies who are complicit in this type of behavior. And that is why I've started to purchase second hand items.  It doesn't directly support firms who allow for these awful working conditions, I end up buying the product  at a cheaper price, and I'm not being completely wasteful and adding demand for a new product that really isn't that much different than the one that came before it.  

Also is there a site or subreddit that keeps track of companies that force their workers to work in such awful conditions? Is there a site or subreddit that keeps track of the companies that do the exact opposite and pay their employees respectable wages or even living wages for producing all these consumer goods?

EDIT: And this is why I also don't necessarily bitch about prices on products.  There is a limit I am willing to spend on something but bitching about prices is just silly.  The price of a product is a derivative of its cost and demand.  If I want to buy something new that is cheap it most likely means that the cost of labor associated to it is cheap, which in turn means that person or people who created this product are most likely not being paid a sufficient amount to make the item. 




 Looks like Stacy will get the bulk of the carries:

https://twitter.com/jthom1/status/386880914292105216 
























 He suffered it in the 2nd to last drive.  He had a couple of good runs at the beginning of the last drive and then came in for that last atrocious play. 




 No details at the moment. 




 According to the post game press conference, Fisher vaguely stated he has a sprained ankle. 









 Unfortunately he was taken for x-rays.

 Since when has the US government been concerned over the privacy rights of its citizens? 




 I agree.  I would like to keep MIR to a minimum.  But I would have to ask my friend. 




 Hey everyone! I'm trying to build a gaming rig for my friend.  He wants it to be under $800 including the price of the monitor.  He plans on playing Elder Scrolls Online and BF4 at 1080p.  Here is what I've quickly come up with.  All opinions are appreciated:

 You can a VPN in the Netherlands and then go to gamepass.nfl.com and watch all the games there for free.  The NFL as an attempt to spread football has offered free game streams there.

You could also just use an antennae to watch local games in HD.

Check out [r/cordcutters](http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/) for more info regarding ditching cable. 




 We have the inalienable right to say and express any idea we want.  If an nfl player is willing to deal with the consequences (ie fines or media/fan attention), he should say whatever he wants.  I really don't see how this is a slippery slope. 




 I feel like a simple, but costly solution concerning player health and safety would be that the NFL just covers the cost of medical expenses for each player for life after they retire from the sport.  I feel that is a fair compromise considering NFL players do not get guaranteed contracts and that the NFL owners do nothing.  The players provide the entertainment, not the owners and not the other NFL executives.  I just really wish the NFLPA was a better run organization and actually used that reality as leverage. 




 I think it would be "pretty dumb" to jump to the conclusion that the Chargers would run it like that based off of a one game sample size against a bad run defense.   From what we have seen ALL season, not just one game, the Chargers are more likely to be passing more than they will be running it.  

As for Allen's value, he should be a top 30 WR.  It is a positive that he did well despite the fact that the team went so run heavy.  I'm not saying he will put up the same numbers he has had the past 2 weeks but he will be a solid WR3 for standard 10 team leagues. 




 Chiefs D, Moreno, Fred Jackson, Reggie Bush, Julius Thomas, Jordan Cameron, Desean Jackson, Gordon, Blackmon, and Allen. Although the latter 2 still have a small sample size of success this year.

I would also put Peyton Manning and Jimmy Graham as steals.  These guys were drafted in the 2nd or 3rd round and are probably worth a top 8 draft pick. 




 Yesterday was the first time this season that the Chargers were so balanced.  They have consistently been a pass first team during their 5 other games.   




 The biggest issue with the healthcare in the US is that it is a for profit industry. Ideally the development and applications of medicine should be motivated by benefitting the well being of humanity not concerned with increasing cash flows.   But unfortunately people just aren't that intelligent or empathetic,  especially in the US.
