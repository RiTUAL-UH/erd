 For me it's not the movie itself, it's the general atmosphere I can't stand anymore. People playing candy crush the whole film, or on their phones the whole movie, etc... 





























 Whatever happened to this series? Do the arcade elements not translate to modern consoles anymore?  




 More choices. I love that video games are becoming more like movies, but the reason I love video games is that YOU control the plot and story. 




 Safe. It's a bizarre film where Julianne Moore gets "20th Century Disease". Basically it causes her to mysteriously break out in sores and have seizures due to certain chemicals and fumes like car exhaust. Nobody understands why she is having these ailments and the film is full of these sterile, long static shots that make you feel uncomfortable.
