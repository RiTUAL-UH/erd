 By relatively cheap I mean under $2,500. 














 It's not a perfect book. The mystery is actually the weakest part of it and the main character, Claire DeWitt, can be a little off-putting, but the whole thing is so unusual, mystical, thought-provoking, richly evocative of post-Katrina New Orleans and even occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, that I thought I'd give it a rec.

It's vaguely reminiscent of The Boy Detective Fails by Joe Meno, so I'm going to give that a mention too.

 You'll often hear people say something like "I (or a friend) doesn't really like reading, but I like book X." I think of these books as "books for non-readers" and I was wondering precisely what is it about these books that appeals to non-readers in a way that other books don't? 

Also, is a book that appeals to non-readers similar to books that I call "brain candy" -- books that are light and fluffy and silly and require no brainpower to process at all, mostly romances but not necessarily?

Your thoughts? 




 It seems to me that a lot of SF and fantasy today engages in excessive worldbuilding to the extent that plot and character development almost take a back seat to description. The most notable example of course is Harry Potter and I think this is the reason why when people finish certain SF or fantasy books they wish for more is because the worldbuilding is amazing but the meat of what a book is supposed to be is lacking.

By contrast, things like LOTR, Star Wars (the movies, not the expanded universe of books), WoT and GoT do not have such extensive worldbuilding. They tell a story and when it's finished, it's finished, and you feel satisfied with it. "I wish WoT was 20 books longer" said nobody ever.

Conversely, Discworld has fairly extensive worldbuilding but you also feel satisfied at the end of most books because Terry Pratchett is great at telling a story and giving you interesting characters. 

Edit: Now that I think about it some more, I see that I can't name as many series off the top of my head as I thought I could. My memory's been influenced by the many threads bemoaning the fact that people can't get enough of X or Y world that must make it seem more common than it is. But the point still stands that it is entirely possible to engage in excessive worldbuilding to the detriment of the characters and story. 









 As I was reading it, I felt like Mr. Mercedes was Stephen King's answer to the Cuckoo's Calling. When a character named Trelawney popped up, that confirmed it for me.

I think that Mr. Mercedes was the better book. Though Cuckoo's writing was a bit smoother -- some of the dialogue in Mercedes was eye-rollingly bad -- Mr. Mercedes worked better as a mystery. Stephen King uses all the conventional techniques and even comes up with a couple of new ones, while Cuckoo came across like Rowling didn't know the first thing about conducting an investigation. And while the characters are a bit silly in Mercedes, at least they're vivid. As soon as I put down Cuckoo, I couldn't even remember how the mystery got resolved, let alone anything about the characters.

I read that the Silkworm is better than Cuckoo and a sequel to Mr. Mercedes is coming out next year, so I'm hoping they both will be improvements.

 There are some authors who were turning out decent books up until they died and some that seem to have run out of ideas but keep churning them out anyway. Who do you think should retire or should have retired from writing? My answer in the comments. 









 First the good. Besides for the utterly boring first 70 pages and the weak, college freshman essay last 70 pages, most of the middle was fairly engrossing. Also, I laughed a couple of times.

Now for the bad. It was engrossing, but not good. The writing was weak and unedited, as judged by the spelling errors and inconsistencies, and by the plot errors and inconsistencies. She repetitively described New York using an overabundance of banal and seemingly randomly-chosen adverbs. 

The main character, Theo Decker, is a cypher. He tells us what he's feeling, but we never quite feel it ourselves. He doesn't particularly have much agency either. He mostly allows himself to get dragged around by whatever dynamic person who's around at the moment. 

The plot is incredibly weak and relies heavily on having a death every 200 pages to advance the story and/or a Dickensian coincidence. In fact, toward the beginning of the book, I was sure that this had to be a parody of Dickens, it was that bad. Later it seemed to be a bit of a Harry Potter AU fanfiction and when Theo's friend Boris starts calling him "Potter" and does so for the rest of the book, I felt entirely vindicated. There also a lot of retconning. She wrote the book over a period of 11 years and I think it shows. 

It's too bad the book didn't end with Theo successfully committing suicide. Then it might have been compared to Shakespeare or Greek tragedy and would be more meaningful for it. Instead we're treated to a long and pointless essay about art, which does nothing to life the book from its mediocrity. In 770 pages it says absolutely nothing original or insightful about art, humanity, or anything else. I am completely baffled why it won the Pulitzer. 

One positive review I read started with something like "I can't explain how much and *why* I liked the Goldfinch so much." If even people who like the book can't explain what they liked about it, it can't really be all that good. It might be appealing, but appeal and quality are not particularly correlated.  




 It's really supposed to be Burn, Read, Rewrite, but I don't believe in burning books, even for fun.

 I went shopping for Fathers' Day cards and by the end of the week almost all the "for father from daughter" cards are sold out while most of the rest are going strong. Who decides what cards to stock? Don't you think they'd notice from year to year which cards are the most popular so they'd stock more of those than the rest? Sometimes I wonder the same thing about milk in drug stores, but my guess is that milk is a loss leader so they don't care too much about that. But greetings cards are expensive!  




 There's a story behind this question but I can't remember what it is.

 When the critics like a movie a lot more, most likely it's artsy and a little dull. When the audience likes it more, most likely it's a dumb crowd-pleaser.

 It's a children's book that probably wasn't published later than 1985. It was about a boy that had a paper route but for some reason wasn't able to do it so his sister took it over despite the fact that people didn't think a girl could do it. I think I remember her having trouble collecting money from the people she delivered the papers to, and there was a dog, a chow, that bothered her and drooled a lot.

 I originally [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2191s4/amateur_shelf_reading/) about my amateur shelf reading in /r/books because that's where I learned the term, but apparently nobody there was interested, so I decided to give you guys a shot.

Last week I did some shelf reading at my library and found a bunch of misshelved books (see previous thread). I decided to do it again this week, but I only managed to get through three shelves on one bookcase because a library worker started hovering around and I felt self-conscious. 

So now I'm wondering if somebody noticed the post or they noticed the books I'd left to be properly shelved and had the brainstorm that maybe people who actually work there (whether as employees or volunteers) should actually be doing it? If so, it's really awesome that I made an impact.

This week I looked at Par- to Patterson. Most of the misshelvings were relatively minor, though I did find a Sarah Pekkanen in there.  









 If so, what book(s)? Or author(s)? 




 Plot summary from Wikipedia:

Five of St Aubyn's novels, Never Mind, Bad News, Some Hope, Mother's Milk, and At Last, form The Patrick Melrose Novels, republished in a single volume in 2012. They are based on the author's own life, growing up in a highly dysfunctional upper-class English family, dealing with the deaths of both parents, alcoholism, heroin addiction and recovery, and marriage and parenthood.

They're sort of depressing and nihilistic at times, but the prose is clever, funny, easy-to-read, and thought-provoking. The best books are the first and fourth, which are written from a child's perspective. 

The other books are weak (especially the second, which comes off like a re-written Bright Lights, Big City, and the third which barely seems to have Patrick Melrose in it at all) but despite how much you pity but also despise Melrose, you feel compelled to follow him on his journey. 

The last book is a bit old hat, like the author ran out of new things to say, but it ends on a high note that doesn't lie and say that everything *is* okay, but that it very well might be okay, after all this time, finally. So you feel glad that it really is possible to transcend even the worst kind of childhood and upbringing.

Highly recommended for people who are interested in the subject matter, particularly the British upper class.  









 How do you go about renting an apartment without a real estate agent? Aren't all the listings in the newspaper or Craigslist fake or get snapped up the day they're listed? 




 After the discussion last week about shelf reading and my admission that it was unlikely that I would ever formally volunteer at the library, I decided to do some shelf reading on an amateur basis. It was pretty gratifying and I intend to do it again.

I did this during my lunch hour so I only had time to look over two bookcases. The books ran Sta- to Stevenson. In the two cases I found minor misshelvings such as SteiNberg ahead of SteiMberg; SteelE ahead of Steel; a book of essays that nobody seemed to realize was non-fiction and will probably be misshelved for the rest of its poor little life (because good luck trying to convince a library worker that it needs to be reclassified); some slightly worse misshelvings such as Strohmeyer; also Inferno by Dan Brown. 

Yup, Dan Brown. In the S's. 

Can't wait to see what'll turn up next. 

ETA: There were other errors but I don't remember them all. Some misshelved books I put in the right place, others I left out depending on how easy it was to find where they really belonged. 




 I hope this is okay to post here; I figured you guys would be more familiar with plays than other subreddits.

(Background) I was writing a story that suddenly occurred to me would work better as a play, which is bizarre because while I've written a number of (unpublished) novels and took a couple of stabs at writing a screenplay, I've never been particularly interested in plays before. Plus, I've read plays, but I haven't seen too many performed.

(Question) So, what is your take on telling a story in a novel versus a play versus a movie format? Is there a particular type of story that lends itself to one format over another (aside from the obvious like action movies couldn't be plays)? What is the selling point of a play?

(Also) Would anybody be able to recommend to me plays with approximately five characters?

 Maybe the question doesn't really make sense, but I couldn't figure out how to phrase it better. Lately I feel like I've been reading two books around the same time that have nothing to do with each other but funnily have similar aspects or elements.

For example, Friday I read Where'd You Go, Bernadette by Maria Semple, which is a modern-day domestic dramady set in Seattle, and Saturday I finished The Abominable by Dan Simmons, which is a historical drama/thriller largely set in England and Mount Everest. But both books have a connection to Antarctica. 

I didn't read these two books together on purpose, in fact I didn't know that Antarctica figured into Where'd You Go, Bernadette -- I took it out from the library without even reading the book jacket. 

Has this happened to you? 




 Has been writing for a long time and/or has written a lot of books, and the opposite. 




 Seems they're trying to prevent people from crossing from the middle of the street, except I didn't see it stopping anybody but me because I was afraid the traffic agents would give me a ticket -- except they weren't paying any attention to what people were doing. (Do traffic agents even have the authority to give people tickets?)

Theoretically this is a good idea because far too many people cross when the turn signals are green and I'm amazed that nobody's gotten run over in front of me yet, but at the same time, the way this intersection is set up, if you wait to cross legally to get to the train station, you'll be waiting for much longer than if you cross in the middle. There should be a legal diagonal crosswalk light. 

I'm pretty annoyed right now.

ETA: And now they've added a big flashing sign saying not to cross, to use the crosswalks. Like, duh, as if people don't know that. But the traffic agents are gone.

 I'm reading Blue Has No South by Alex Epstein. It's a book of really short stories, flash fiction, I guess. I'm finding them incredibly hard to understand. Here's one story. What do you make of it?

The Man Who Lived in an Elevator

In his last years in the elevator old age had disposed of his hair (in the mirror he saw the reflection of a caveman whose hair was turning white). His children, who were ashamed of him, used to stop him on the lower floors and give him pictures drawn by his grandchildren.

 There was a recent thread that had a list of classic heroines and one of them was Katniss. The Hunger Games was published in 2008; it cannot possibly be considered a classic yet.

I was thinking that a book can't be considered a classic until it's been in print at least 20-30 years. In other words, it needs to be read a generation after it was published. (50 or 60 years would be even better -- two generations after it was published.)

And if you want to talk about a series, it's 20-60 years after the *last* book was published, not the first.

Your thoughts? 




 I remember a softcover science fiction novel that was probably published in the late 1980s or early 1990s. It had something to do with cat people and for reason, I'm thinking tea. I think the author's last name was toward the beginning of the alphabet.  









 I find that I prefer Russian, Japanese, and Spanish over French and German. Maybe it's the subject matter, maybe it's the translations or maybe it's the quality of the original languages themselves, I don't know.

 And by women's novels I mean stuff by people like Maeve Binchy, Elin Hilderbrand, Jodi Picoult, Fannie Flagg, etc. -- relatively serious books about women's lives.

I do not mean chick lit like Bridget Jones or the Shopaholic series. I also don't mean romance of any sort, whether hardcover or paperback.

 This past week I read Life After Like by Atkinson and First Sight by Steel and I rated them very similarly (3/5 stars and 3.5/5 stars respectively). 

Atkinson's book is ambitious, creative, and fairly-well written, but overall it's just not that good. The characters and relationships aren't engaging, the basic story has been done to death, and the most creative aspect of it didn't pan out in the end.

Steel's book is pretty bad, actually. It's a dumb romance, dumb characters, fairly bad writing. Though there were a couple of plot twists that I genuinely did not see coming and that's what kept me from rating it lower.

So in the end, I slightly preferred First Sight because I wasn't disappointed by it. I knew what to expect and pretty much got it. To me it feels worse to have my hopes dashed by a book that turns out to be overhyped. 

How do you feel about books that don't live up to the hype versus mediocre bestsellers that do what they're supposed to do? 









 I'm looking for creative ways of including movement/exercise in my day. I have a 9-5 desk job and overall I'm pretty sedentary. Currently I walk at least a quarter of a mile every day and stand at least an hour a day, on average.

Is it fair because not wanting to keep reading a book is a pretty good indication that there's something not good about it?

Or 

Does it depend based on what they didn't like about it?

 Agree, though MIT is a specialized science school, so I suppose it's a bit more prestigious in its field than Oxford or Cambridge, which I don't even know if they offer science degrees.  




 Interesting etymology of the -crat ending.

-cracy 

word-forming element forming nouns meaning "rule or government by," from French -cratie or directly from Medieval Latin -cratia, from Greek -kratia "power, might; rule, sway; power over; a power, authority," from kratos "strength," from PIE *kre-tes- "power, strength," suffixed form of root *kar-/*ker- "hard" (see hard). The connective -o- has come to be viewed as part of it. Productive in English from c.1800.

 Some of you might remember from a little while back that I was doing some amateur shelf reading. Someone recommended that I avoid doing non-fiction and I wholeheartedly agreed until today. I was looking for a play and discovered the non-fiction was in just as bad shape -- if not worse -- than the fiction.

The play I was looking for was listed in the catalogue as available but was nowhere to be seen. Which was not surprising considering what I found. It might have been anywhere. 

There was one thing I didn't understand. A dual-language book of poetry had the Dewey Decimal Number of something like Gle 891.621 N Dhomhnail. (I don't think this is the exact book, but it was a similar number.) I couldn't figure out what the Gle was supposed to mean so I just left the book on a shelf and hoped somebody who worked there would find its correct home, which, now that I'm looking in the catalogue, appears to be on a different floor entirely. 

I have the feeling that this poor little book will never find its home. And nobody will ever take it out because it's not where it's supposed to be and then it'll get weeded because nobody's taken it out in X number of years.

Oh the humanity!

 Absolutely. When I was younger I pretty much only got books by browsing the library shelves, but as I've gotten older, that hasn't worked out for me as well. So now I keep extensive to-read lists. 

Though I still love browsing. Looking at the different covers and reading through summaries are great, even if I don't even up taking the books. 




 It's actually recommended that you don't read right before bed because reading is stimulating -- it makes you think, and thinking can keep you from falling asleep. I have personally found that even a boring book can be stimulating. Once I stopped reading right before bed, I started falling asleep a lot faster.

In his autobiography, Tony Bennett claims to have created "...the first music video" when he was filmed walking along the Serpentine in Hyde Park, London in 1956, with the resulting clip being set to his recording of the song "Stranger in Paradise".[8] The clip was sent to UK and US television stations and aired on shows including Dick Clark's American Bandstand.[9]

 Here's a site selling them. They don't remotely scream "Jewish" to me: http://www.leelach.com/tichel/sinar-tichel.html 




 I watched the movie a couple of weeks ago and am currently in middle of the book. It's a very faithful adaptation so it really doesn't matter which you experienced first, and anyway, it's almost always better to watch the movie first. 




 I'm going in early spring. I'm interested in the arts, hopefully with a local flavor. 




  I love her for who she is, not because I have to as her mom.

I don't see the problem here. That's exactly how a parent should love their kid -- for who they are. In my opinion people who only love their kid because it's their kid are usually pretty messed up. Having both is ideal, but if you only can have one, I'll choose your way over the other way any time. 




 At my work, back in the day when they issued paper checks, employees were given an extra 15-minute break on payday in order to go to the bank. 

I'm not sure why "most people" in OP's question can't go to the bank during their lunch hour if this extra break isn't a perk they get. 




 It's been a while since I've read them, but IIRC in Very Bad Deaths and Very Hard Choices by Spider Robinson a character had uncontrollable telepathy and couldn't stand to be around anyone except this one guy. (Not romances.) I didn't like them as much as I wanted to, but I'd generally recommend Spider Robinson so long as you're willing to put up with blatant political preaching. 




 Thanks! 




 A bunch of university libraries and the NYPL have it. See if you can get to one of those libraries or if your local library can request it via interlibrary-loan. Unless you want to buy it for upwards of $100. 




 I've read books with that premise. Maybe not with vampires, but the person who can read everybody's mind except for that one special someone. 




 Thanks, but I guess I should have specified how is it that they play the game so well? I've played various levels of, say, Angry Birds, like 50 times and I'm lucky to get 1 star and they're getting 3 stars. 




 ETA: I meant how is it that they play the games so well? I've played a level of say, Angry Birds like 50 times and I'm lucky to get past it with 1 star, forget 3 stars. Sometimes I can't manage 3 stars even when I'm copying the walkthrough.  




 It's a relatively common phrase/sentiment that's been around way before the Office (started in 2005) and Reddit (started in 2005). 




 MI5 comes to mind. It's not "the MI5." 

Honestly, I don't believe there's any real answer to this aside from "that's just the way we talk," but certainly the answer is not "there needs to be a the." There doesn't *need* to be a "the." 




 That's not an answer. In America we don't say "the ABC" (American Broadcasting Company). 




 Yes, 35. And that's one of my problems with the books -- I don't get the feeling that Rowling has any idea what 35-year-old men are actually like. 




 Too old. Despite the fact that Strike comes across as old and grumpy and decrepit in the books, he's only 35. Dominic West is 45 and looks it. 




 Weird fonts. Right now I'm reading a book that looks like it came out of a mid-1990s inkjet printer. It's so distracting. 




 I'd say I read 90% genre fiction. Literary fiction almost always disappoints and I like to take my time with classics, so I tend not to read very many of those types of books. 




 See if your library has an interlibrary-loan service. 




 Ha-ha. 

"a recessed landscape design element that creates a vertical barrier while preserving views" 




 People who have trouble backing out of parking spaces usually taking 2-3 times the amount of time than usual.

Can't say I've ever seen this particularly. Though maybe they're being careful. That's a sign of a good driver, not a bad one.

People who insist on yielding to you when it's clear they have the right of way.

Have experienced this all over NYC, nothing to do with wealth or competence. People think they're being polite by yielding.

People who drive well below the speed limit in broad daylight and perfect weather.

Do you live in a city with a lot of old people?

People react much slower whenever the light turns green at intersections.

Yup, you live in a city with a lot of old people. 




 I hear it everywhere that it had a big influence on today's world.

Where have you heard that? In relation to what? 




 Da Vinci worked on commission. 

Galileo worked in academia.

Wikipedia is your friend. 




 Yup. I don't think the art linked in the pictures is particularly good. In fact, it barely qualifies as fine art. As far as I can tell it's the artistic equivalent of Muzak -- bland and uninteresting. 









 What are some things to do in the cities in the evening besides for bars and clubs? 




 NYC housing market -- Mitchell Lama is mentioned but not public housing? 




 Me too. It recommended the Monster at the End of This Book. While that's a super book, I'm not sure it follows as a recommendation based on my ratings.

Also, a lot of books I searched for didn't come up. Maybe they would have if I had the ISBN's, but I don't have time for that.  




 That's right. It's old school sexism. Huge difference between sexism and misogyny.  




 I had to look at the picture three times before I saw the swastikas.  




 "Lincoln, sometimes I think I've walked into a Quentin Tarantino move when I'm talking to you."

The Skin Collector by Jeffery Deaver. Not one of this best. 




 The Book of Raziel the Angel. I found it somewhere and thought it was cool, so I stuck it in my bag and never took it out. It's about two inches square and the print is so small you can barely read it without a magnifying glass. 




 but don't know enough of the back story to understand how it came about

So that's the thing. The person wasn't necessarily "involuntarily" put there like they were committed to a mental hospital, but more likely were pressured into going most likely because the family didn't want to and/or couldn't afford to take care of them at home. 




 It's not an old wives' tale, the toothbrush makers do suggest this, but it's really just their way of trying to force you to buy a new toothbrush. 




 French, German, Dutch.

Laotian, Tagalog, Malay.

So, the answer is that neither of these is a typical ending for either language group, they're just ones you can think off the top of your head. 




 Sure they do. I once interviewed with an editor of a mystery magazine. I don't remember how it came up but she said they didn't take stories from bestselling authors because they refused to be edited.  




 Nobody's perfect. I recently watched a news interview from the studio that the station also streamed online. When they went to commercial, the screen was supposed to go blank and the mikes were supposed to cut out, but the first time they went to commercial, the mikes stayed on. They kept talking. I don't think anybody embarrassed themselves, but what they said wasn't really meant for public consumption either.

Point is, the camera and the mikes are controlled separately. You assume that when the camera is off so are the mikes, but obviously it's not always the case and there's no little red dot to show you that the mikes are off. 




 In many cases, curing a disease would have to entail gene therapy and we're very very far away from that being a typical treatment. 




 Like anything else that people try to do, learning a language requires a bit of talent. Not everybody has it. So when they hear a foreign sound, they simply aren't able to recreate it. Or they can't hear that they haven't pronounced it correctly -- like being tone deaf and trying to sing. 

Also, not everybody learns a foreign language from a native speaker. My French teacher in high school was American and her French accent wasn't that great. So it's not like I had anywhere to learn a French accent from in the first place. 




 I can't understand that thinking. People I know either enjoy reading or they just don't read. I never knew anybody who felt the need to force themselves to read if they didn't enjoy doing it. 




 Psalms are always good for when you're feeling bad. 

I wouldn't recommend talking to a rabbi regarding serious psychological issues. It has nothing to do with respect for them, that's silly, they're pastoral leaders, it's part of their job to help congregants, but at the same time, if you're have serious issues, unless they're also trained in psychology, I don't think they'd have much to offer to you any more than a close friend would. 

Unless you're specifically interested in learning about Judaism and Jewish rituals. Then by all means, go for it. 




 Not everybody affiliates themselves with a denomination. They just recognize that they were born to Jewish mothers and then don't incorporate a Jewish identity into their lives in any way. Considering that Lisa Bonet and her mother both married non-Jewish men, I'm going to have to go with no denomination. 




 Why do people who read have to have goals? I mean, what are your TV goals for 2015? What are you music goals for 2015? 




 It's because if a series is successful, the editors stop editing. They just publish all what the author wrote and particularly when it comes to fantasy series, these authors have a tendency to be wordy.  




 There's really no way of knowing why it hasn't come out yet. Things were happening behind the scenes that prevented it from being published, that's all that's possible to say. At the moment it's scheduled to be released in July 2015. 




 HP wasn't good, it was a phenomenon. The next phenomenon will come around sooner or later but you won't be the right age group to appreciate it. 

The Percy Jackson series is almost entirely for preteens.

You say that like it's a problem. Not all books are written for teens, you know. 




 A while back I had this type of dream. I interpreted it to mean that I was going on the Internet too much and was yearning for it like an addict. 




 Good on you. 




 It's inappropriate, that's for sure. Considering your friend is 16, family counseling might be better idea than going into foster care. 




 I could use $1,000 right now, so yes. 




 I liked Infernal Affairs much better though I kind of got the impression that if I hadn't seen The Departed first, I might not have known what was going on. 




 Beats me, I thought Viggo was severely miscast.  




 Not that I particularly disagree with what's already been said, but my grandparents had opaque glass, so clear glass is at least partially just a trend. If you Google "frosted shower glass" you'll see that it's around. It's just not as popular as clear. 




 The difference is that Santa Claus has its origins in Saint Nicholas, who was a real person. There's nothing to believe there in the first place. It's just a story and everybody who isn't 6 knows that. 




 No.

This sort of thinking made me want to throw Divergent across the room. 




 I bought one, but I guess it wasn't good quality because all it did was give me a headache. And honestly I don't feel like spending hundreds of dollars on a lamp. 




 114 so far. Huh. That's on the low side for me. Though I will definitely finish at least 6 more by year's end. I already posted the best books, so here are my worst:

2.5/5 stars:

- The Monkey's Raincoat by Robert Crais

- Murder on Bamboo Lane by Naomi Hirahara

2/5 stars:

- The Contortionist's Handbook by Craig Clevenger

- The Death Trade by Jack Higgins 




 Entirely true, but might be more appropriate to post in /r/writing. 




 Definitely keep it. It can never hurt to work on yourself to be a stronger, happier, healthier person. 




 25% or less. 




 I only wear concealer to cover up the dark circles under my eyes and the occasional spot. Takes a few seconds. 




 Entirely depends when and where the person died. On someone's doorstep, probably pretty quickly. Under a bridge, not so quickly, especially in the winter. 




 Einstein's Dreams! Definitely go with that. In terms of readability, it's short and very easy reading, very easy to understand, but it gives you a lot to think about.  




 I don't use Goodreads, but I just checked a few of the books I've read recently against Amazon's ratings and Goodreads seems slightly more accurate. Not by a lot, but on Amazon, almost every distribution of ratings is the same: A huge amount of 5 star reviews and then fewer and fewer of the rest. While on Goodreads the distributions don't have any kind of pattern. 

But I don't really find overall ratings all that helpful anyway. Usually it's the 3-star reviews that have the most objective reviews and you can get 3-star reviews on both sites. 




 Agreed. He's projecting his own stress, unhappiness and resentment. While I'm unhappy with my work I'm not especially stressed (not a secretary, but still an underling). My bosses on the other hand, are super-stressed. They have high-power, high-pressure jobs and bosses that come down on them harder than anyone ever comes down on me if I mess up. They have a lot more responsibility than I do, and that creates stress.

When I moved into a windowless cubicle it definitely disrupted my sleeping pattern to the extent that it was night for me twice a day. Ever since I started taking Vitamin D about a month ago I've been sleeping better and losing weight without altering anything else in my life.  




 It is frowned upon.  




 How is obesity escapism?

Eating in order to drown your feelings is definitely viewed negatively. So is laziness, if it's excessive.
