 There were some notes on windows phone 7 but I haven't read through them yet. I'll make a note to go check it out. 




 While the formatting on most of those is garbage it might be easier than this big txt file, I'll play with it thanks for the link. 




 I had thought maybe I would use admob for mobile ads but goddamnit I hate ads. So for now I don't want any money. If for whatever crazy reason hosting gets expensive I'll worry about that then.

 You bastard. 




 That would be pretty awesome. I'll look into it as soon as I've made my way through the MASSIVE amount of books still left to add.

Also if anyone knows how to quickly do it chime in as I'm sure it will be a while before I get to it, though I do want to get to it. 




 or use apps like [securely](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/securely-password-vault/id470475299?mt=8), [1password](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-for-iphone/id285897618?mt=8), [splashid](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/splashid-safe-for-iphone/id284334840?mt=8) etc. 




 you can search by images in google, drag your image into the search box. http://bit.ly/ofLiP8 




 Do this:
Restart everything and flush your cache by opening terminal and type dscacheutil -flushcache
That should take care of your troubles. And if not, I'm so sorry, because iOS 5 is amazing.

Make sure you flush everything with itunes closed. After that reopen and it should all work.

 I would post a screenshot of my audible library but it isn't really as impressive as a shelf full of books :| 




 To be fair you can create a work path in a jpg giving it transparency on the outside of that work path. 




 Most of these actually look worse with helvetica

 They have changed my entire outlook on life. I am quite literally a better man because of the OP. 




 oh google, you bring me joy in the smallest of ways 




 Very well done, I really enjoyed it. 




 My wife loved it :) Now I just need to buy a crazy over priced custom frame and I'll send you a photo of it up. 




 Message me with a price if you're willing to sell it. It would make a fine xmas gift for my wife :) 




 Awww no old Sierra adventure games :( 




 How do I watch this in the the US?  




 Making maps on the BUILD engine was so much fun. 




 I really like this artists handwriting.

 Holy hell that was awesome. 




 For reproduction you are probably best going with something like blurb or lulu. Here is an example of an artbook project I just finished with a bunch of other artists. Granted this one was all digital work submitted to me in an approved template, but you can see the final pdf's, images of the printed work from blurb and how it is setup for sale (no profits are made on this).

 There are lots of them, they are usually called an infinite zoom, or a quilted zoom or something.

 I wish I had hair like that :( 




 I like how grumpy the viewer looks in the 5th picture down. 





























 I'm not the best at getting my thoughts written down. I thought I made the point that if you have been designing for a while it is part of the natural progression of things, or at least it seems that way for me.

A huge portion of my job recently when developing apps or websites is the UX end of things, and it naturally lead to choosing to do that full time as opposed to just doing it along with developing the UI and actually building it all (html, javascript, Xcode etc).

If your job already has you doing these things, and you enjoy that end of it, then you should consider doing it full time as it is a good way to step into a higher position and make more money. I should have been more clear on that point. I didn't mean to come across as saying you should do UX only for the money, as in my experience that is one of the last reasons to do work. I think I actually had an entire section about doing work you enjoy but my friend who read through the article told my I had too many tangents :) 




 Sorry I've been in the digital end of design for so long now I just assume everyone knows what it is :)

Part of my new years resolution is to "not be such a shitty writer" and I suppose part of that is not making assumptions about the audience. It actually took me most of the day to write this. I didn't know getting my thoughts out on 'paper' was so difficult. 




 It's partly an exaggeration..

I know none of those ask for a decade of experience and a masters degree, but I have seen those posts in the past. I always assume it is just someone in HR posting a bunch of stuff they don't understand.

 I didn't realize cafepress was still around. Maybe take a look at society6, I've been using them for a while for art prints and the quality of their work is pretty great. 














 For others that don't read much, or any manga, read from right to left. 









 the verge is a nice site for many reasons. i guess i dont get the joke.

 Getting off the internet usually helps. Also music. 




 They were tiny wrestlers. I don't remember what they were from or why I had them, but they were awesome and were always in the sandbox with my hotwheels and micro machines. 




 Thats good thats actually what I was drawing. 









 You're right, what was I thinking :( 














 I went from an Intuos3 to a cintiq and I'm happy with the switch. The intuos is a bit faster and more responsive, but I only have a 21UX. I imagine the new 24hd and 24hd touch are better.

I still love drawing on the screen more than on the intuos, but as you said the price jump is pretty significant. 




 You could use [behance.net](http://prosite.com/?utm_source=network utm_medium=footer utm_campaign=network_footer_references), they have a pro site for portfolios.

 We went on vacation to Venice last year and my wife got really annoyed with me pointing out things that were in Assassins Creed.

It was pretty awesome.

 Am I the only one who thinks 2.5 hours for each tuesday bombcast isn't nearly enough? 




 It looks good I like the 'Maintained by Urag gro-Shub" at the top. This might help you btw a lot of the crap is edited out and formatted. Also it is just a simple .txt you can do with it what you want.

 I was actually going to make this an iOS app first but I wanted everyone to be able to use it, so I went web app route. 




 i could put everything into a .mobi file and you just email it to your kinle and it can convert it all sexy like. 




 oh shit i should make a mobile icon for android and ios. maybe one with a poop on it. 




 Scream my name while pushing. My goal is to have nerds the world over yelling my name while dropping bombs.

 I made some updates, did it help with anything?
