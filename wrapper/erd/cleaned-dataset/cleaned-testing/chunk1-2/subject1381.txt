Transcript of Recording

Subject #2907: Id like to start with where I think it began. You know, the cassette?

Martin Howard: Sure, why not. Just let me update your status first.

Subject #2907: You werent recording that?

Martin Howard: I just didnt want you to feel pressured, like you had to put on a facade. [clears throat] Patient [NAME REDACTED]

Subject #2907: Please, doc. If you could include my status after I have already left, Id appreciate it.

MH: Well, its like I said earlier - although we can acknowledge that the paranoia exists, we shouldnt give in to it.

2907: I know, I know, but could you just humor me this once?

MH: Alright. So, then, start with the cassette.

2907: Well, as you know, [NAME REDACTED] and I read about geocaching and decided to try it out. Theres so much potential in that area. Its all so wide open, uncharted, beautiful...in places like that, theres bound to be hidden shit. 

MH: Right, of course. Go on.

2907: So, we spent the week doing just that. We didnt find much, just trinkets, really. Kinda seemed like people kept getting caught up in the adventure and forgot to bring stuff to replace it with. So they just tossed out whatever their pockets happened to be carrying. [laughter] We found a penny from the seventies, an empty lighter, things like that. We wouldve been bored with it, if people hadnt made it so damn hard to find.

MH: Thats the point, isnt it? From what youve told me.

2907: Yeah, it is. So we didnt mind. But then we finally came across our first big find. Something that wasnt junk. It was a VHS tape in this tin can that looked old as fuck. I was kind of bummed at first, because there was enough damage on the actual film that I didnt think it would be playable. But I decided to try it out anyway, and after dropping [NAME REDACTED] at home so she could go to work, I popped it into my old DVD/VHS combo.

MH: So, [NAME REDACTED] wasnt around when you saw this? I thought you said she was.

2907: No, no, I just said I felt like I wasnt alone when I watched it. Like there was someone there with me.

MH: Someone like God?

2907: Definitely not. More like I felt like someone was watching me. Shit, I hope God wouldnt make me feel like that.

MH: Why did the tape make you feel this way? What was on it?

[long pause]

2907: You sure I have to repeat this? I thought we talked about it before, when it was recording -

MH: [talking over Subject] We did, but I actually didnt have it recording then, and I figured it would be better to get it now, now that your memories of the incident are a little more clear.

2907: Alright. It, uh, didnt really have anything at first. Just some static-y darkness, like when you first start a VHS, but before the actual film? And then, with those VHS blocked letters, it said 5:55 AM. Then, right under it, it said, SNOW in capital letters. And then the text went away and it showed this snow covered place. It was still lightly sprinkling snow, and you could tell it was late at night. The clouds were doing that thing when it snows, where it just forms one big mass? And no moonlight can get through? So the streetlights and whatnot reflect off it. I liked it before then.

MH: Where exactly was this video taking place?

2907: Near this one intersection. But, remember, there was a shitload of snow and no tire tracks or footprints or anything anywhere. It was a pretty even layer, and I remember that area usually being pretty heavy with traffic, regardless of the time of day -

MH: So youve been to this area before?

2907: Well, yeah. Kind of hard not to, being that its right next to [REDACTED]. I didnt recognize it right away because of the all the snow, but as soon as I did, the camera sort of panned downward and then behind. This person was walking barefoot through ankle-deep snow, maybe higher, and the only sign of, you know, life, were her set of footprints that seemed to go on for miles. Then it came back to the persons point of view, facing their surroundings again, and I noticed [REDACTED] had all of their lights off and appeared closed, which I thought was really weird.

MH: Arent they usually open twenty-four hours?

2907: Yeah, thats what made it so weird.

MH: Maybe they were constructing it at the time.

2907: But they had all of their advertisements up, and it looked the same as it does now, just dark and sort of abandoned. 

MH: Okay, that is strange. Continue.

2907: So this person walks a little longer, almost to the intersection, and they just stop. It was sorta peaceful, like you could hear the snow softly falling, and this persons even breathing. I listened closely to see if I could hear any traffic, just any background noise, and I turned my TV volume all the way up, but I couldnt hear any signs of it. Thats when they turned the camera on themselves.

MH: And who was this person?

2907: You already know. Dont get why youre -

MH: Im just trying to get every detail down.

2907: ...It was me. And I dont mean like Hey, she could pass off as me! or Wow, we have similar features! No, it was me, like I was looking in the mirror. And I was smiling super wide, like I was excited or trying to take a ridiculous picture of myself. They - she - I, I guess? They got the camera pretty close to their face, or my face, and I could see that my gums were bleeding. And all you could see was my mouth when they said, They know about you now. 

MH: They know about you now?

2907: Yeah, thats all she said.

MH: Do you know what they mightve meant?

2907: Nope, havent got a clue. But after she said it she pulled the camera back to show my whole face, and grinned even wider before turning the camera off. 

MH: Was that the end of the tape?

2907: I think so. Kind of. It tried to show some other sort of text, but that mustve been where the tape was most corroded because I couldnt make it out. And then there was a blurry shot of a street name, or a building name, maybe [REDACTED].

MH: I see. Well, what did you think of it?

2907: Are you serious? What the fuck was I supposed to think? It freaked me the fuck out. I called [REDACTED] but then remembered she was at work, so I hung up and texted her. 

MH: Before we move on to what happened next, I just want to clarify a few things. Do you have any memories of recording this tape?

2907: Of course not. Why else would it have freaked me out? Pretty sure I wouldnt be here if I did remember it.

MH: I know it seems pointless, [REDACTED], but I just want to get everything on the record.

2907: Who the fuck cares if its on the record? It doesnt matter anyway, seeing as it everyone keeps saying it didnt happen. If it didnt, why do you keep questioning me?

MH: Im sorry, [REDACTED], you have a valid point. Why dont we give it a break for today? Okay?

2907: Yeah, okay.

MH: I want you to really try to get your memories in order, though, so we can accurately document this. This will be important to your case. Just remember that.

2907: Ill try. But I honestly just want a break from thinking about it.

MH: Then let it come naturally. Just keep in mind that the sooner we are able to identify your problem, the sooner you can be out of here. Lets work on that. Okay?

2907: Okay. 

MH: Have a good day, [REDACTED]. Go ahead and ask for some water on your way back.

2907: Alright. Later.
