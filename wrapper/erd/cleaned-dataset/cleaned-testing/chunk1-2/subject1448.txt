 HUEHEUHEUHEH 









 Same thing here. It used to happen with me last year, i had 2~3 ''visions'' per day, and I got used to it just like you. My ''visions'' were from minor events of the day, not only when someone was about to call me. Nowadays, i think i have 1 ''vision'' per week, don't know why this happened =/ 




 Edited, lol 




 I'll soon turn 18, and i play poker since i was 15. I really want to invest in my poker career, but i don't know where to start.

EDIT: I played in pokerstars since i was 15.

EDIT2: Thanks for all the answers, means a lot to me! 




 Wow!! That's an amazing experience/writing. In my country, the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms is a very discussed (and studied) thing: the presence of trusted people alongside you, during the trip, is very important indeed to the trip travel safer roads.

One question: do you remember the species (and the dosage that you guys used that night) of those shrooms? It is a valuable information, cause the totality of the trip fully depends of those partcular factors.

Again, nice experience, bro. Would have gilded if i had gold jajajajaja. 




 And you've been high for how long in this particular trip? 




 And you did not feel like trying crack again? 




 Wow, and with such an unusual metting, are you guys still together? 




 All types of drugs are accepted. 
























 Good point, but no one in my family smokes... and that one cigarette had some drawings in it (which my friend had done).

It was, with no doubt, the same cigarette. 




 Yea mate, ain't nobody is american :D 




   Well, so I'm on my class waiting for the last bell rang, so we can go home. My friend, just for fun, puts a cigarette (which is very prohibited in my school) in my ear. I immediately take it off my ear and it falls in the ground.
  But the thing is, we looked down so we can hide the cigarette again, but it completely disappeared. We looked for it for what felt like 15 minutes, looked our backpacks, the ground, everywhere. I even went to the bathroom so I could take my clothes off to see if it fell within me: nothing, the cigarette was gone.  We just accepted it and went home.
  This was 3 days ago. Yesterday, I was using my PC when I noticed, on the top of my desk, the same cigarette that fell on the ground and disappeared. I was like: WTF?!? The first thing I've done was to talk with my parents to see if they found it in my clothes: they didn't. I even talked with my brother who, somehow, could have found it: he didn't. The cigarette just TELEPORTED to the top of my desk (which I am always using) 2 days after he fell into the ground of my class and completely disappeared.

Glitch? Probably.
