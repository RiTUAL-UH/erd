 Got a ship from Stephen last year, clapped out near Uranus and I'd to hitch a comet the whole way home. Frozen, I was. 




 I'm against it as the consequences of failure could lead to the irradiation of an entire province. Plus our electricity demands don't require a nuclear power station.

To look at Germany, Spain   Portugal achieve 40% upwards of their needs via renewables last year - it would seem irrational of us to go with nuclear.

Then the cost of the radioactive waste disposal is a bill our childrens' Ireland have to pick up, and most countries with the capacity will not accept another country's waste. IIRC there are ships with nuclear waste which simply circle the globe while governments fight over who is going to take it.

I think nuclear is a solution to a problem we don't have, and there are better solutions available. Finally, when a country with the engineering expertise and reputation such as Germany reckons they can do without - why would we join the nuclear party when everyone else is leaving for very good reasons. 




 Cheers for the tip Eamon!

I've no interest in this government or any other one privatising domestic water provision by stealth. And it's unlikely this can be anything else, plus I really don't appreciate having to pay for the metering such companies will have to rely on. In fairness, Phil Hogan is in charge of it - and we all saw the suspicious fiasco he caused with Greyhound.

On a more general note, I'll do my upmost to make sure that any issues that effect the whole country will be "trawled in the media" at every opportunity I get.

Of course, in case anyone has forgotten here's a [little link](http://www.broadsheet.ie/2011/06/01/say-it-aint-so-eamo/) to just how two-faced that travesty of a TD truly is. 









 The closest I know of would be this image:

http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=62 t=2713

and there's a few more community images here:

http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=77 t=3410 

The U2 / U3 images are interchangable 99% of the time, so don't let that put you off.

The user who creates the majority of these images 'robroy' is fantastic, so asking in the forums would be the best thing.

The first image should fit the bill. I'd certainly start with the images from the forums, rather than creating your own isos, as they work 'out of the box' and take away most of the fiddling around for drivers etc.  




 I absolutely love them. Versatile and small, I'm setting one up for a friend who wants a pc on their TV and I'll be able to velcro the odroid to the back of the tv for extra tidiness.

Here's a quick comparison [photo](http://i.imgur.com/hQ7KFAx.jpg), U2 on the left and the U3 on top of the Pi. I'm not sure they sell the U2 anymore.

If you do go for one, I'd also get an 8gb eMMC card rather than boot from an SD card - the eMMC are really fast. 

Though it's very handy for testing to use SDs and a lot of people have SDs sitting around unused. 




 I use an Odroid U2 as a home server, NAS, book server, torrenting machine, motion server and all of that barely stresses it.

They've upgraded it now to the [U3](http://hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php) (an extra USB port, slimmer profile). It's $59 before shipping and is even slightly smaller than the Pi :)

There's loads of tips and projects on the [forums](http://forum.odroid.com/) too. I use one as my main desktop too as they're fanless and silent.

Just to add, I still use my Pi for XBMC as its gpu is better at 1080p than the Odroid's, though not by much.

 It's something I've had experience with recently, horizontal lines on the nail mean a trip to a doctor would be worthwhile and possibly overdue.

If they're not on the other nail then I reckon it's the bullet and not such a big deal.

Seeing the youthfulness of the skin I wouldn't expect to see either horizontal or vertical lines on the nails, verticals will happen to most (eventually) - horizontals are worth a check-up. 









 Wow, that looks painful, ghastly   eventually relieving! Your pain threshold must be impressive at this stage.

Hope you don't mind the question but the horizontal striations on your big-toenail, are they on the other big toe too?

 




 It's the Last of Us for me.

I enjoyed Bioshock: Infinite, its weaker parts are better than many other games' good parts - but I think the game doesn't work as a complete experience in the way TLoU does.

B:I has nowhere near as much tension, and so doesn't pull you in or make you care to succeed / survive to the extent TLoU does.

Often during B:I I felt like I was wondering around a deserted museum. A museum filled with glimpses of the game that could have been, and I suspect a game that was diminished so it could be coded for current-gen consoles (e.g. the difference between the final game and the initial [years old trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajCiS0_ssLE) which still to me has more tension than the acutal game).

I felt I played all the game that Naughty Dog wanted to make and I would have played hours more of it.

I was glad to reach the end of B:I and kinda finished it just to see the end for myself - I was ready to finish the game hours earlier.


 









 I let Steve Ballmer weigh in on that one:

["We released fantastic games, and, **most importantly**, we expanded Xbox to go beyond great gaming to deliver all the entertainment people want  sports, music, movies, live television and much more."](http://kotaku.com/the-new-xbox-boss-is-steve-ballmer-638364468?utm_campaign=Socialflow_Kotaku_Twitter utm_source=Kotaku_Twitter utm_medium=Socialflow) 




 We released fantastic games, and, most importantly, we expanded Xbox to go beyond great gaming to deliver all the entertainment people want  sports, music, movies, live television and much more.

So, maybe the multimedia focus wasn't all Don Mattrick's idea? I guess it had to be signed-off further up the hierarchy. 









 Do you think the XB1 has more compute units in the GPU? Wouldn't MS have mentioned that by now? I guess they can't seeing that it was an MS engineer that let slip the info that the XB1 has less.

As for the 'current leaks', that refers to the GPU clock speed. I'm sure if it was a differentiator between the consoles, the console with the higher speed would have announced it already.

If there was an XB1 tech-spec sheet with the same level of detail as the PS4 then we could all settle the differences between the two, when are MS going to reveal more details I wonder. What's the delay?
 
 




 See for yourself: 

http://www.anandtech.com/show/6972/xbox-one-hardware-compared-to-playstation-4/2

On the graphics side its once again obvious that Microsoft and Sony are shopping at the same store as the Xbox Ones SoC integrates an AMD GCN based GPU. Heres where things start to get a bit controversial. Sony opted for an 18 Compute Unit GCN configuration, totaling 1152 shader processors/cores/ALUs. Microsoft went for a far smaller configuration: 768 (12 CUs).

Microsoft cant make up the difference in clock speed alone (AMDs GCN seems to top out around 1GHz on 28nm), and based on current leaks it looks like both MS and Sony are running their GPUs at the same 800MHz clock. The result is a 33% reduction in compute power, from 1.84 TFLOPs in the PS4 to 1.23 TFLOPs in the Xbox One.  




 So why not provide some links that contradict what is a well referenced post? 




 Oh I reckon they'll keep the eSRAM for games whenever possible - TV / Skyping etc. wouldn't require the time-critical benefits of it. If MS are aiming for 1080p games running at 30 or 60 fps - they'll want all the juice they can give it.

I'm sure it could be put to use when games aren't running. Though with the consoles expected to be on shelves in 5 months, these drip-feeds of info better not be what developers are also getting. 




 I reckon it's a blisteringly fast pipeline of sorts, as it's on the same chip and all.

To be honest, I think the article creates as many questions as it answers.

A detailed one-sheet spec from MS themselves would be handy at this stage, the speculation won't go away until there are some solid numbers.

I won't be getting either console until they've been 'out in the wild' for a while anyway. Though if details don't come soon - I'm betting that MS could end up with a warehouse full of lemons by January. Word spreads a lot faster than it did 7 years ago. 




 What's been said now suggests that the eSRAM is even better than MS thought but the details about speed   bandwidth (skimpy as they are) don't form a solid picture.

Either one hardware part has been slowed-down on purpose to achieve read   writes at the same time or one of the numbers is plain wrong. 

The story is incomplete - be that on the journalist's side or from the story's source. 




 The PS4 hardware has clear advantages.

The XB1's response to these apparent advantages is its eSRAM - if this works as planned it should balance out, some to most of, the hardware differences.

There is only 32MB of the eSRAM available. So it has to used for something important, and also something that isn't (in data terms) very big. Probably data that needs to be quickly delivered and then replaced with an updated version and delivered again. Software will have to be written with that in mind.

If the eSRAM can't be used like this or if it's too tricky to make it useful that way - then devs might avoid it and the processing of the game will suffer. PS4 games would look better and cost less to get looking that way. 




 Yeah, they dropped the number of shares from [5 to 3](http://uk.gamespot.com/news/sony-getting-stricter-on-ps3-and-psp-game-sharing-6344077) but it's still going.

 It's not that the TV part won't allow me, but that the licensing agreements across Europe are so problematic that there isn't even a standard Netflix catalog.

As for sports, I don't think there's any hope Microsoft can provide on that while even fully licensed national stations can't agree with each other pan-europa.

Plus each nation has its list of national free-to-air sports events that must be shown free-of-charge. Disallowing Microsoft from showing them to Xbox Live only subscribers - not a business incentive for them. 




 Oh, I know there's no solid info - yet when Kinect came out initially there were similar claims to have 'not-abandoned-the-core-gamers'. That didn't pan out and neither did a ground-swell of Kinect fans.

Microsoft will be in a great position if/when they've 8 new games to tout at E3 for the X1 but they don't have a previous delivery on promises to back it up.

Sony have presented many PS4 exclusives already, and they haven't shown the machine yet.

It's all very crazy, but either PR companies are toying with them both for shits/giggles/profits, or one of them will have some pointless advertising bills to pay.

I'm in Europe so the TV part of the X1 won't sell it to me - there needs to be very compelling games; the spy-in-the-cab isn't helping either. 




 So certainty   comfort all round, that's nice.

I guess hedge-funds won't be using Microsoft this Christmas. 




 True, but I don't think Microsoft used this as a springboard to E3 - now they really have to bring the fireworks.

Yesterday's announcement should have encouraged many more enthused people for their E3. I think it's creating the opposite. 




 If they had gameplay to show, they'd have presented it - an arbitrary wait wouldn't be mandatory (unlike the mandatory infrared Kinect camera   microphones)

 That'd be shocking really though, there's no work in the construction sector generally but there's loads to be done in this country. Money is becoming less of an object (at the government level, our bonds are doing well).

 Yeah, doesn't inspire confidence that the diary is filled out after the fact. I'm sure other ministers can confirm whether that's a regular occurrence.

Plus, we don't need this speculation at all. We can just ask 'Alan Shatter   Officials' when the meeting was held and check their diaries.

I'm sure the Taoiseach doesn't drive around on his own either, so wouldn't the driver service have a record of where he was that day and when they drove him there?

 




 Yeap same day as Sinn Fin are asking about.

I'd be inclined to go with the harmless interpretation that "I wasn't in Dublin until around 4", grand, the meeting in the Shelbourne was at 4.30; plus "Sunday morning meetings are rare, but I wasn't in Dublin at all." [at that time, but I was in Dublin later].

However, considering the early morning Shatter meeting was in the diary for the 23rd and is about the Garda business - it's all seeming a little suspect. Alan Shatter had no intention of resigning back in March. Plus the idea that the diary is filled out retrospectively is bad practice or just smoke-screen.

I'm for water charges in principle   practice, but as a conservation and infrastructure maintenance measure. Not this cludge from a government that still hasn't told us the cost per litre. Do they not know or are they not saying? Well, it's election time so I'm guessing it's both.

Putting in meters rather than fixing the leaks first, tells me this is more the prelude to privatisation than an environment resource measure. No commodity suits the needs of hedge funds better than water - people will always need it. And the push for privatisation has been going on for some time.

 Smithers, Release the Cows! 




 It absolutely would. But what are the chances that the other 2 taxes we pay for water will remain in place?

This is a cash-grab, not a conservation measure.

Irish Water are spending our money on meters now, not fixing leaks which would be the ultimate conservation measure. 




 We are already pay for water via taxes (twice). The new water charge is not going to be spent on water infrastructure for some time. It's to pay off county council debts. That's the reality there.

There are many other deserving sources of revenue generation that could be tapped, rather than another charge on our tapped-out citizenry.

Anyway, it's such a non-story there are four links about it above. Plus no-one's being charged for water yet, many things could change, though we'd have to be non-defeatist about it.

 Don't let [Superintendent Foxtrot](https://imgur.com/Sc8af2c) have anything to do with your life (page 306).

And from [RT](http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0509/616164-guerin-report/):

The report concluded that Mr Shatter did not heed the voice of Sgt McCabe despite the high esteem in which he was held.

Mr Guerin said that was despite the minister having specific statutory powers in the area of complaints from members.

Mr Guerin said there was a "near total absence" in the papers he had examined of written records of submissions made, or advice given, to the minister by his officials.

He said he had seen no written internal records of decisions made by the minister.

Guerin said the approach adopted "had the result that there was no independent investigation" of Sgt McCabe's complaints.

He concluded that the absence of written records was a "matter of some concern", saying it appeared that the minister had acted "on foot of advice received by the commissioner", without that advice being questioned or analysed.

That is atrocious, Shatter looks like he completely sided with whatever Callinan wanted.

Labour sure know how to pick 'em. 




 I'm going to put this in the same box as the Russian lad who wanted to mine helium 3 on the moon by 2015, or the giant inflatable ring they were going to orbit beside the moon about 20 years ago.

 I'd be happy to overtake the UK, Japan's education system though creates a fair few zombies (I taught an 11 year old over there with grey hair) so let's not aim too high. 




 Here's another one, though I've no idea about the paper mentioned - maybe someone here knows it:

 You can use [ES file manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop) to connect to the Pi and thus it's harddrive and download them to the tablet that way.

Though if it's simply to watch movies on the tablet while within range of your home network you are much better off streaming the movies to your tablet. Use either the tablet's built-in video player, many come with network streaming now, or use something like [YAACC](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=yaacc fdid=de.yaacc) to provide the bridging-link between the Pi, your tablet and its video app. 









 I see he's going to give Defence to a [current minister](http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/fitzgerald-confirmed-as-new-justice-minister-629934.html), wonder who that'll be. 




 Which I can totally see, what I can't see is how the volume of water used by 13 million people is ultimately cheaper than the volume of water used by 4.5.

Together with the Tube, the awkwardness of city infrastructure in general - I imagine digging up for repairs is more costly in London also. 




 I know one person in that situation, it's an old row of houses in a small town - so I reckon it could be very common.

And then there's my brother's house where nobody knows where to put his meter. He even called the original builder (in his 70s now) and he'd no clue where it met up with the town supply either.

Three different people called my brother about it from the contracting company without knowing about the other calls, so you can imagine phonecall #3 was shorter and louder than 2 previous. 




 The situation I mean is where the branching points from the main pipe to all the other houses (after house A) are under house A or otherwise inaccessible. 

Making house A the only one that can be metered, or the piping has to be redone from scratch for all the houses. 




 According to the Irish Times we'll be [paying 0.2 cents per litre](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/bath-set-to-cost-16-cent-while-a-shower-will-set-you-back-25-cent-1.1787308).

So 0.2 cents per litre = 200 cents per 1000 litres or

2 per 1000 litres.

So we'll be more expensive than London, a city with a greater population than our whole country.

Wouldn't it be great if Phil Hogan or Irish Water actually told us the charge? 









 One thing I haven't seen resolved are the cases where a row of houses share the one pipe - making it impossible to individually meter each house's usage.

What happens if the house that can be metered (or simply one of the houses) refuses to pay the bill - do all the houses have their pressure reduced to a trickle? 









 I can really see a motive for Microsoft in this,  they are facing a future where windows becomes a legacy OS. With only a few copies of windows required inside a VM even within an enterprise context.

Then I looked at the permissions for the new android version of Firefox today, I reckon Firefox is more deserving of an arched eyebrow in this case and in a more general sense - than the purists posting user controlled solutions on forums

 You're too kind, it was an underage rent-boy and the cocaine was bought with tax-dodge money. 




 Cheers, but don't worry it's outside all year round!

It's an Irish [Ash tree](http://www.treecouncil.ie/irishtrees/ash.html), not to be confused with all the other 'ash' trees around the world.

Here are its [bigger brothers](https://i.imgur.com/7q5pGDd.jpg), that always come out earlier.

The one in the blue pot I'm minding for a friend while her dog gets out of a chewing habit :) 




 I wonder will he go to the Dil committee he scheduled to attend tomorrow!?

edit: He is. 




 Ireland wasn't given 14 billion, the Royal Bank of Scotland propped up its own failing subsidiary (which happened to be in Ireland) to the tune of 14 billion.

 Much apologies, I may have my wires crossed on this one!

Looking at both, I'm having a hard time deciding which species I [have](https://imgur.com/U0ca2sU).

Either way, I only know one other person who's training them as bonsai. Cheers for the other plant name!
 









 Ah, not where I'm from (Ireland), every mention of a Money Tree is a crassula. 




 Seconding the money tree [(Jade Tree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_plant), will tolerate a fair amount of neglect and can look very bonsai after a year or two.

I recommend they should be grown in a regular sized house-plant pot for a year (or two) until the roots have developed. Then placed into a shallower bonsai pot.

Ficus drove me bananas, I swear they have a passive aggressive nitrogen deficiency thing going on. 




 I reckon that's a completely accurate way of looking at this blast from the past.

Here's another, Eamonn Gilmore will say anything while not in power to get votes - he's just a politician after all and not exceptional in this regard or example.

Yet this can tell us 2 things:

* Eamonn hitched his ride to the Workers Party on principles of a fair society / water provision that he no longer adheres to.

* He has yet again (his Lisbon treaty flip-flop) kowtowed to an EU directive over and above the directive's intent (reasonable decision making reforms / water conservation) and decided it's more about cash for institutional fuck-ups. Or at least, let his 'betters' instruct him so.

In any election there are 'turkeys voting for christmas' - e.g. the ~17% who voted FF in the last election - but Eamonn's turkeys and christmas are movable feasts. He doesn't have to worry though, his policy choices do not have to read as any egregious compromise for the country. He'll simply blame the majority partner with a 'what would it have been like without us' reasoning. He may be expecting the limited communication abilities of 80s here, as his stance won't wash in our internet era. 

I've heard plenty of secondary school students get riled up about this blithe indifference to the net, netizens and it's technorati. As if the net's only an exaggeration-engine and not also the 'printing-press' with a power Irish newspapers envy.

His eyes are on his life after politics. I think his leadership will retire what 'Labour' is left of the Labour party, and his party seems fairly fine about it.

That Ireland's electorate vote via reflex, in pluralities, is a daily awful reminder that the Dil is us. We have done this to ourselves to a very large part.

That is no excuse for the failure of its cheerleaders, such as Gilmore though. 




 I don't reckon he's a puppet-master either.

A combination of minence grise and experienced solicitor should be enough to cow a taoiseach who is unable to debate his own policies in public.

I'd certainly claim Enda is a puppet.

I'd put Shatter at set-designer   back-stage bouncer though, not p/muppet-master 









 ~~Anne Hathaway~~ Catwoman for #2 




 That box of rocks is scared of a public debate, nevermind a party contributor. 




 Ah, Elaine Byrne isn't likely to be anyone's stooge:

["The chair of the Revenue Commissioners, Josephine Feehily, noted that although 289 cases of illegality were identified in relation to the largest tax evasion scheme in Irish history, not one person has been prosecuted over the Ansbacher tax scandal."](http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/elaine-byrne-major-reform-is-essential-to-tackling-whitecollar-crime-29383431.html)

Corruption is long established here, we'll need a generational die-off and more like her - with unfettered outlets for their research - if we're to bring it down to 'normal' corruption. 




 Jaysus, Billy Hawkes finally grew a pair!?

It'll probably be like the time he found one of Facebook's privacy invasive practices "completely unacceptable" and then let them carry on with it for 6 months (enough time to rehouse the activity outside the EU).

This will be overturned on appeal, then Alan can brush the shit off his shirt to let it drop on Billy. It's not like 2 people have lost their jobs after tangling with him, or anything.

Alan S must have some shit on E E that they expressed confidence in a Minister for Justice that broke the law on national TV. Has a minister (for Justice) ever done that before? 
 



















 this is **sometimes** false

 Sure that's easy to fix, just prove that the claims are inaccurate. 




 Yeah, will suck to be those without the nanotech defenses.

 In fairness, all of those points are **their job** - for which they are paid more than adequately.

Have we reached a point where we expect so little from the Dil that TDs turning up and doing what they're elected to do is laudable?

Here are some other achievements:

* Held a referendum on a stability fund that we can't access a year and a half before we would have needed it anyway. Losing a negotiating position in the process.
* Asserted the need for a pay-cap in public positions, which is then flouted by the Taniste.
* Let the Minister for Justice mislead the Dil after he revealed a TD's penalty point situation live on national TV. None of which jeopardises his job.
* Failed to address the shortcomings of the Data Protection Commissioner which has now lead to the drafting of new EU laws, one of which is specifically designed to avoid the need for EU citizens to go through that Irish office to make complaints.
* Allowing a debt defaulter to be in charge of the country's biggest budget which, surprise surprise, he can't balance.
* Failed to address the egregious loopholes exploited by foreign multinationals which sees a certain company pay 0.14% in tax, instead of 12.5%. Meanwhile Irish companies the absolutely vast employers of people in Ireland see new levies, taxes   rates while remaining on 12.5%. Corporate welfare at its finest.
* Introduced a Property tax   soon a Water charge which makes a mockery of maintaining basic social welfare rates and rates of income tax.
* Increased school classroom numbers which are now the highest in Europe.
* Fails to acknowledge that much of recovery in this country would not have been possible without the ~400,000 people who have left Ireland over the past 5 years for work.
