If not, do you really want to privatize it which means turning it over to Wall Street and having fees charged every quarter for managing "your money"?    I don't understand you as much as I try. 




















































































  http://www.netrootsnation.org/  I went 4 years ago and had a great time.   


































 This interview made me very anxious.  The interviewer sounds very reasonable.  How did Simpson get appointed to this committee?  And wouldn't it be great to have an intelligent interview with a committee member? 














 I'm a liberal, but this is getting too much for me.  Is it time that we "ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country." 

















































 My laptop picked up some virus on reddit last November.  There was a post on it at the time, but it was already too late.  If I remember right, it was not in windows or directly in reddit.  Now, I have to unplug my computer and remove the battery almost every time (not always, but most times) I boot up.  Does anyboy remember this and know how I can fix it.  I would appreciate any advice on this. 




















































































































































































































































 I told them I was a Democrat voting for Obama, but I am still getting thier robo calls! 




 The original was one of National Geographic's most memorable photos. 




 I posted the Guide as it can be helpful, particularly in nonpartisan judges races when you don't know who they are.

This is the progressive guide. 




 I guess when Republicans were crying about voter fraud, they were talking about  their own members.  I haven't heard or read of one incident by Democrats, but have read about destroying ballots in mulitple states. 




 How about government which doesn't create jobs, but Romney will create 12 million jobs as President? 




 I saw my niece's photo yesterday volunteering in a Romney campaign hdqtrs.  She had two children under medicaid, although she is now married to the father. 




 Harry Reid is a Democrat and a Mormon.  I know other Mormon Democrats. 




 Want to come to my house?  My pool needs replastering and repair! 




 Romney is Bush on steroids. 




 I'm watching CNN now stating Romney won.  Drives me crazzzzzyyyy. 




 I have a friend who is a CPA AND is an Oracle programmer.  Travels everywhere she wants. 




 That I could have done better. 




 I love you Paul Krugman. 




 Wow.  A lot of comments!  A co-worker and I discussed it.  We would offer $1 million to each co-worker who would walk away with us that day. 




 1890 or 1990? 




 I like that. 




 They also didn't want the economy at that time. 




 Yes, it is one more form of corporate welfare.  People need a living wage. 




 Wow.  I appreciate you summarizing it like this. 




 I been doing that for 40 yrs.  Getting too tired.  Just hope others can take over in greater numbers. 




 I agree, and their sleasiness. 




 I haven't read the article, but there is still too much talk about the grand deal.  We need to change the premise first. 




 Who would have thought Bush would win a second term?  Yes, these guys will stop at nothing.  Did you read the article about Bain owning the company that supplies a lot of the voting machines? 




 The existing super rich will end up with it ALL. 




 JFK, RK and MLK assassinations, and who was behind the plot to overthrow FDR. 




 You are so right.  Now, how do we convince others? 




 This is common.  The Post Office is a good example.  Congress voted them to keep 70 years (or 80, I don't remember the details) in retirement funds, which meant they would not have enough money to operate today.  Then they blame the PO mgmt for not being able to meet today's expenses. 




 Didn't the last guy who was going to testify about the 2004 presidential race in Ohio die? 









 And I can't even get some of my closest friends or family to see. 









 i am so tired of them, and their baby-like tantrums. 









 I used to play Diplomacy, but you need 6-8 people to play and it can be a long game. 




 Awesome view.  You can see five mountains lined up out the window.  I got a photo too, but was on a clear day with blue skies. 




 It is my biggest scare.  I don't have a choice though - Romney who promises cuts to SS, and Obama who has shown indication to deal with the republicans on this issue.  The last time there was a ss compromise was a disaster for some of us.  I'm looking at my future ss cut of $400 due to the last agreement.  What will they do this time? 




 Doesn't matter.  There are still enough people to vote for him no matter what he says or what his policies are. 






























































































































































































































































 I see these ads that you can build your own panels from factory seconds.  Has anyone done this, and does it work?
