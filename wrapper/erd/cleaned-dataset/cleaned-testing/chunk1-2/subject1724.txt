 Just got one, and it was setup in under 5 minutes. 

(StillGoing) ChicagoVPS - 2048MB RAM, 50GB Disk, 2TB Bandwidth, 2x IP address $40or$30/year - 4 Location Choices
ChicagoVPS is now offering a 2GB VPS for $40 per year, this time with 2 IPv4 addresses and now offer an additional location option (Atlanta)

UPDATE: The wiki went bye-bye, don't know why. Look at post 5 for most of what was in there.

UPDATE: I just found a code that seems to give you almost the same deal at $30, 2GBYR 
More info from Kevin: 
to clarify about the $30/yr deal. It is valid for the "Enterprise" plan listed here: http://chicagovps.net/openvz.html. It only includes 1x IP, and is only valid for our Chicago, Buffalo, and LA location (Not Atlanta). The $40/yr STEALOFADEAL offer is separate order links like I gave you earlier, and includes 2 IP addresses. It is also available in our new location Atlanta.

This is not technically a repost, because the other thread about this particular deal got deleted. The STEALOFADEAL offer actually costs $10 more than the previous deals, and it comes with 2 IP addresses. 

2048MB (2GB) Dedicated Ram
50 GB Diskspace
2TB Monthly Bandwidth
100Mbps Port
2x IPv4 Address with STEALOFADEAL
1x IPv4 Address with 2GBYR code, but $10 less, but no Atlanta
SolusVM/OpenVZ
Instant Setup (most of the time)
Free Backups
3 or 4 Location Choices: Los Angeles, Chicago, Buffalo, (Atlanta on the $40 code)

$40/year with promo code "STEALOFADEAL"   2 IP addresses
Order in Chicago, IL - https://billing.chicagovps.net/ca...dd pid=160
Order in Buffalo, NY - https://billing.chicagovps.net/ca...dd pid=161
Order in Los Angeles, CA - https://billing.chicagovps.net/ca...dd pid=162
Order in Atlanta, GA - https://billing.chicagovps.net/ca...dd pid=163

$30/yr deal. with 1 IP address and no Atlanta
http://chicagovps.net/openvz.html - Choose Enterprise, 1 year recurring


The promo code to use is STEALOFADEAL or 2GBYR- over $200+ in savings Just be sure to select the 12 month billing cycle when ordering then on the next page you will find the option to enter in the promo code. This price doesn't go up after the year is up either.

When signing up, use an easy password, and change it later. Some folks had trouble with complicated password during signup.

Disclaimer: I don't work for, nor am I anyway associated with ChicagoVPS. I have one VPS with this company, and I paid $40 for it. They aren't giving me anything. Yes, I know they should, but they haven't. 

What is this, you may ask? It is an online Linux computer that you have root access to, and can install and run practically anything. Read the TOS, 'cause that doesn't include P2P sharing, folding, bit coin mining, seti stuff, and anything else stupid like that, that might kill the performance for everyone else. 

Anyways, like I said, you get root access to a Linux box, and when you screw that up, no problem, they give you a control panel that lets you reinstall a new OS in minutes. Pretty cool. With a small effort, you can even vnc into it with a full GUI.

Don't expect the world from this, you get more than you pay for. Think twice before you bet your business on this, although I think there are people that do.

 Cool! 




 I guess NewsBlur changed it from 64 to 12 free feeds due to the incoming traffic? 

 




 I think because FeedDemon relies on Google Reader for synchronization. 




 The few times I requested support he responded. 




 Nick Bradbury, the author of FeedDemon is closing. See http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/the-end-of-feeddemon.html

That was the nail in the coffin for me. I hate to say goodbye to FeedDemon after a decade of working on it, but it's time to say goodbye. When Google Reader shuts down on July 1, FeedDemon will also disappear. 




 Same here. Most of those have disappeared over the last few months but I also went premium.  




 If you are concerned about privacy then I would look into a self-hosted solution like  http://www.feedafever.com/ ($30) or http://tt-rss.org/ (free) maybe. 




 Yes, I like it as well. Seems to work well and it looks like it imported most of my feeds in one shot.  




 http://tt-rss.org/ is back up but it's a self hosted solution (free). 




 Same, I am most likely going to go with a self-hosted one like http://www.feedafever.com/ ($30) or http://tt-rss.org/ (free) as those seem to be the best for me right now.  




 This is probably from the crush of traffic? Mine updated automatically before all this.  




 I had trouble with some feeds on import. But then again I can't be sure if this was due to the load. It was simpler to manual subscribe to the ones I had problems with.  




 I'm using http://theoldreader.com/ now to test. I also need to check out and recommend looking into https://www.newsblur.com/ http://www.feedafever.com/ and http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki

 Yeah, looks like you have 90 days. Via http://blog.reybango.com/2013/02/04/making-internet-explorer-testing-easier-with-new-ie-vms/

Time Limits on the VMs

All of the VMs have a time limit before the images will become either limited or unusable. Heres what they are:

IE7  IE10: 90 days of total time from the moment you first use the VM. Basically its 30 days usage with two 30-day rearms.
To rearm, go into a command prompt and type in slmgr rearm
IE6 on WinXP: Will expire 90 days from the time we upload it to modern.IE. Theres no rearm it but well keep this refreshed when the 90 day kill date nears.
At the end of the 90 days, heres what will happen:

IE7  IE10: Youll be able to use the VM for an hour before it shuts down
IE6/WinXP: Youll be prompted for an activation key with no way to get past it 




 So do these still expire after 90 days?

 I don't think you can run the game or let alone install it without Origin. Like Steam, Origin needs to run while you play Origin games as far as I know.

 Summary:

If /lib64/libkeyutils.so.1.9 or /lib/libkeyutils.so.1.9 exist on your server, it is very likely that your server has been compromised. Removing this file appears to be a temporary fix, but since the attack vector is still unknown, that is not guaranteed to be a permanent fix.

Based on community input, it appears that RHEL-based servers are the only ones affected so far. Servers with control panels such as cPanel, DirectAdmin, and Plesk are also affected.

From Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_fly

 Contrary to myth, crane flies do not bite humans, nor do they consume mosquitoes. The larvae of some species are carnivorous on other small invertebrates, sometimes including mosquito larvae. **Many adults, however, have such short life spans that they do not eat at all.**

Stuff in bold makes me sad.

 Last paragraph...

 To this day, no mobile telephone standards committee has considered
or adopted any end-to-end (phone-to-phone) privacy protocols.  This is
because the big companies involved, huge telcos, are all in bed with
NSA to make damn sure that working end-to-end encryption never becomes
the default on mobile phones.

 The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us -- there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.
