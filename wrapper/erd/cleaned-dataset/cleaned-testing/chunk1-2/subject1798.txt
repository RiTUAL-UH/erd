 Forget the ads unless you want to compete against a hundred other applicants. No matter how good you are, if you're coming off the street you're going to get lost in the pile.

Instead, identify 5 companies you want to work for. Think about what you are actually **qualified** to do, even if the only thing may be to push a broom and scrub a toilet. Try to find out an important person in that department and arrange a 15 minute meeting with them. Almost everyone will give 15 minutes to somebody who shows initiative.

Now, you have to know what they're looking for, and know something about the culture of the company. Do your research. Explain to them why their company is a fit for you and vice versa. 

If you get the job, remember 3 things:

1. Show up 5 minutes early.
2. Do something every day that isn't asked of you.
3. Stay 5 minutes late.

 I would. You'll have plenty of chances to drink KJ at parties and weddings. When you are searching for yourself, try something different. Those vineyards are trying to make a name for themselves so you might discover a real gem. I have a friend who is an excellent sommelier. He started a winemaking operation a few years ago and just released his second vintage, a 2013 sauvignon blanc, for $16.99. He put a TON of time into getting it just right for him. 




 It's always a gamble, whether at $15 or at $100. I think what you enjoy is very personal. My wife and I have very different tastes but neither is "wrong." What I like about $15 is that I'm not out a whole bunch if the wine makes me say "meh." 




 It depends on the vintner. Some $20 bottles might as well be $8. But for more reputable small-batch vintners, a $20 wine probably has a little higher quality of production. The sugars are monitored more closely to determine harvest, the destemming is more thorough, the blending is a little more deliberate to create more complexity and balance that the winemaker is seeking, and it's probably aged a little more and perhaps finish-fermented in oak or cement. 









 Thank you, Ohio State, for showing why we needed a playoff. 




 Urban Meyer has always been a gambler. We'll see if it bites him in the butt this time.

 At the end of the day, it's still about viewership for ESPN and the SEC can deliver that better than any other conference. 




 **This** is why we've needed a CFB playoff. Because OSU obviously deserves a chance to make it to the championship game. 




 Damn, Alabama is the best tackling team I've ever seen in CFB. 




 start delayed to 9 pm EST. 




 Ohio State is the only team that will give Oregon a game. Alabama would get steamrolled. 




 You will get your wish. And you will regret it. There is no school in the SEC that is prepared for the Oregon offense. It's one thing to watch film and come up with a game plan. It's a completely different thing to be on the field. 




 FSU defenders not used to defending an option. You gotta make a decision. You can't be undecided. 




 Now let's just hope for no injuries. Ducks deserve to play the championship game at full strength. Well played, Oregon. 




 Exactly. Keep your team in the game mentally. If you don't convert a 4th down, the game is over. That was not the time to make that decision. That's a last-5 minute kind of decision. 




 I can not believe the coach was willing to put the entire game on the line in the 3rd quarter. How much is FSU paying him?? 




 When a coach makes a call like that, they're telling their team that they are panicking. Dumb decision. 




 FSU deserved to lose after that stupidest decision of the entire year of any coach. 




 No way. They are risking the entire game in the 3rd quarter? Dumb decision. Bad decision. Take 3. 




 That was seriously an awesome play. FSU defense has never seen an offense like this. Class is in session for FSU. 




 Oh boy, now the ball goes back to Oregon with time left for them to score. 




 FSU can definitely move the ball on Oregon. They're just not sharp inside the 20. 




 Cry me a river. Fucking white people.

 Correct rule, wrong interpretation. You should round down to 20.  




 The rule is half plus seven.  




 A progressive tax does not necessarily eliminate the incentive to having higher income unless it's up near 100%. There is, of course, a curve--The Laffer Curve. All economic models show that a progressive tax will produce the most tax revenue while still enjoying economic productivity.

In the 50s and 60s, the United States enjoyed a tremendous boost in productivity and wealth yet the top tax rates (for the top 0.1%) are almost double what they are today. 




 No tax targets only the area in which a corporation or individual is based. It all goes into a pile and is apportioned. To look at taxes as being earmarked would lead to a gross misunderstanding of the federal revenue and apportionment system of the United States.

Second, corporations do not benefit themselves. They are set up to benefit individuals, from wage earners to shareholders. By shifting the corporate tax burden to individuals, you can more accurately tax the benefit that the individual receives.

Third, eliminating the corporate tax also eliminates the incentive for keeping profits overseas and brings more money back into the U.S. where it helps Americans, rather than helping foreign economies. 




 If you ask economists, some of the proposals that almost all of them agree on would include:

* Eliminate corporate taxes - companies can reinvest more money into their businesses and create more jobs.
* Eliminate mortgage interest deduction - this deduction distorts the housing market and tends to give more benefit to wealthier people.

There are others but these are the two biggest ones off the top of my head. 




 As others have already stated, Duverger's Law is at work here. The "winner takes all" system practically guarantees that up to half of a district's citizens will be disenfranchised. I see it as a major reason for today's voter apathy.

 Glucose is a monosaccharide, meaning that its a single sugar molecule. It's pretty much the only thing cells burn for fuel. You are right that when you eat glucose, it goes directly into the blood to be used by your cells. Fructose heads to the liver where it's metabolized into lipids (fat). Here's where you went off track:  sucrose is a disaccharide, meaning it has two sugar molecules bonded together. Sucrose is 50/50 glucose and fructose. HFCS is 55% fructose, 41% glucose so the two really aren't that different. It's best to get your glucose from grains and avoid sugar altogether.  




 "You can be whatever you want to be."  Bullshit.  




 I had an awesome BK experience a couple of days ago. I put in my order for 2 whopper combos and I watched as my cashier overfill the French fry holders (what are they actually called, anyways?). He actually pounded the scooper and holder on the counter to get as many fries into the holder as he could. Then, after putting the fries and burgers in the bag, he took the scooper and dumped a bunch more fries into the bag. That has never happened before and may never happen to me again.

 There are a lot of social and financial factors at play. Essentially this is the result of cheap, easy debt and the 30 year mortgage. The price of something is set by how much somebody is willing to pay. If somebody is willing to spend 30 years paying for something and are able to get a loan with a monthly payment of upwards of 35% of their gross earnings, it will likely drive up the price of that item. And because the fed keeps the lending rate so low, banks can charge lower interest rates on mortgages. Does that mean people will lower their mortgage payments or be willing to pay a higher principal for homes? The latter. Again, this drives up the price of homes. 

But that money comes from some other part of the economy. Food, clothes, vacations, retail goods. All of these suffer.

 The ratio of the national debt to the U.S. GDP isn't high compared to historic levels. 

The idea is that a free or low cost education would be incentive for more people to get post-high school degrees, thereby attracting companies with a smarter, more capable workforce. This in turn would increase salaries and result in higher tax revenues. 




 Yes, and thanks for a better explanation than mine. 




 My response assumes you're referring to the U.S. economy.

The U.S. borrows at an incredibly low interest rate, in the tenths of percent. That's because the creditworthiness of the U.S. is high. People like buying U.S. debt because it's a safe place to park their money.

The U.S. gets enormous benefit from this. Let's say you make a really cool widget out of your garage. By yourself you make one a day. A rich uncle is willing to loan you $500,000 at 0.15% interest. You can use that money to buy more equipment, hire and train workers. Now you are earning 10X or 100X what you were earning before, AND employing people. That's a multiplier effect on your GDP. You'd be stupid not to take the money.

The U.S. uses debt to build roads, networks, satellites and pays for research that benefits everyone, and a military to protect all of it. In other words, that debt helps the producers produce more in a safe and fairly well regulated market.

 This example is about lying after receiving immunity. Maybe not exactly what you're looking for? You may not get charged with making a false statement if you have more serious charges in front of you, but it wouldn't look good for you if the case made it to court.

11th Circuit Court of Appeals: 
*Giving a false statement is an independent criminal act that occurs when the individual makes the false statement; it is separate from the events to which the statement relates, the matter being investigated...We agree with the circuits that have addressed this issue before us and have determined that Garrity-insulated statements regarding past events under investigation must be truthful to avoid future prosecution for such crimes as perjury and obstruction of justice. Garrity protection is not a license to lie or to commit perjury.*

 Dude, it sounds like she is way needy for affirmation. That's why she needs you to affirm that you still put her on a pedestal and I suspect that's also why she had the affair. 

It's a double-edge sword. It may be part of why you were attracted to her to begin with (that she needs constant affection from you) but it appears that, like any drug, its effect wears off and she will go looking for more affection from other places. Until she gets some psychological help to understand why she went looking for the thrill in the first place, I'd be pretty careful.

But then, if she somehow fixes what is wrong with her, she may not be the same person you fell in love with. 




 You are right with your example. If the act of drinking itself is a crime then you don't have to admit to it. It's the same as pleading not guilty to a judge even though you did commit the crime; you are presumed innocent until proven guilty.

 Compass headings aren't accurate enough for cross country flight, especially when you have crosswinds (meaning the aircraft's nose is pointed in a different direction than it's actually flying. General aviation (private pilots mostly) use a lot of dead reckoning (i.e. looking out the old window). Commercial aircraft flying at high altitudes tune in to radio beacons called NDBs, VORs (and even AM radio stations) and they sort of zig-zag across the country flying straight from radio tower to radio tower.

 Power (Watts) = Potential (Volts) x Flow (Current)

I'm rewriting my explanation to make it applicable to solar panels.... hold on.

Solar panels are rated in watts. A good analogy is water coming through your garden hose and you've got your thumb on the end of it. Your thumb is the resistance (ohms). When you increase your thumb's resistance, you increase the water pressure (which is comparable to volts) and decrease the volume (which is comparable to amps). Your municipal water pumping station is like the wattage. A more powerful pump (higher watts) will increase the water pressure and/or water flow.

 The three Constitutional amendments that give the Supreme Court authority are:

* The 10th: Federal powers

In other words, States can define marriage but not in any way that would violate Constitutional protections. They can, for example, set minimum-age requirements, who can or cannot perform the ceremony, divorce laws, but they can't discriminate by telling people who they can marry (Loving v. Virginia). 




 Public schools are funded from tax revenue and generally must accept everyone who lives within their district. It's a lengthy and almost impossible process to kick someone out of public school. Public schools are governed by an elected school board.

Private schools get no funding from tax revenue. There is an application process and it's easy to kick someone out. They are not required to administer any of the standardized tests that public schools do.

Charter schools are public schools with an application process. They receive a predetermined amount of money per student that they accept and it's generally fairly easy to kick someone out. They must also perform all testing required by state and federal laws. Charter schools are governed by their own boards established by their own bylaws. 




 Frying in oil produces a crispy texture because it has a high boiling point. Unlike potato chips, fries and tater tots aren't cooked to the point of driving all moisture out. They retain some moisture. As soon as you take them out of the fryer the moisture starts to affect the texture of the food. The longer you wait the worse it gets. The refrigerator just makes more moisture collect on the surface since less of it evaporates in the cold air. 




 In Utah they used a variation of the "Please, think of the children" theme. The Utah AG's office argued to the court that the State has an interest in promoting child birth and stable families, and that same-sex marriages hurts the institution and somehow dissuades opposite-sex couples from marrying.

Never mind that:

* There are opposite-sex couples who can't conceive, yet are still granted marriage licenses.

* Divorce rates and the number of single-parent households are higher than ever under current marriage laws.

 Incomplete compared to what we know today, but not wrong. Evolution (speciation) was well known prior to Charles Darwin. What Darwin did was explain how it worked. Prior to Origin of the Species, people thought, for example, that giraffes stretched their necks through the process of reaching for the leaves on the upper branches of trees and passed this on to their offspring. Darwin came up with the theory of natural selection, that mutations (they were thought of as natural variations at that time) which gave an individual a small advantage would be passed on while variations that decreased survival would obviously decrease the chances that individual would produce offspring. 




 Money is probably the greatest economic invention of all time. It lets people get things that they need without actually having to trade for it, and to let people become specialists which accelerated technological advancement.

Before money, there were no people who only were masons because they would go hungry since they would have to trade work directly to a farmer for food. After money, the farmer paid the mason, which allowed him to focus on farming without having to know how to build his house. The mason took the money and paid toolmakers who then paid other farmers for their food.

Humans being what they are, a moneyless society would break down pretty fast because there would always be slackers who just rely on asking others for help without giving much effort in return. 




 Bold red wines have high levels of tannins at bottling time. The tannins, which help preserve the wine, come from the grape skins as well as the oak barrels during secondary fermentation. The grape skins and the oak add complexity but the tannins are so astringent that you will have a more difficult time tasting the subtleties. The tannins break down over time (depolymerize) to reveal the wine's nature.

You can help a young high-tannin wine be more drinkable by decanting it to introduce a lot of oxygen which depolymerizes the tannins. If you want to do this instantly, use a blender (seriously, works great). 




 Because the value of a car depreciates rapidly. If you finance a car, you are more likely to justify purchasing a new or newer model based on your monthly payments. If you pay cash, you are more likely to purchase a used car where the money you lose through depreciation is significantly less than any income you would have gained from the interest by investing the difference. If you even invest it at all. 




 The amount of debt compared to GNP/GDP is quite low. The two aren't independent. The U.S. debt helps us push GDP to its high levels because it funds education grants to make smarter citizens, police and regulatory agencies to help ensure competition, tax incentives to build factories that employ people, roads to transport goods, and a military to protect that economic engine and keep it humming. 




 It depends on the bread recipe too. Ever tasted old butter? Staleness is mostly caused by fats getting oxidized. Breads that have no fat (like bagels) won't taste stale but they dry out, lose their texture and harden faster.

By the way, the same applies to meats. Ever wondered why meat stews and chilis can last in a fridge but grilled steak, even wrapped tight, doesn't? The meat in a stew is covered by liquid which inhibits oxidation of the fats. 




 I think it mostly depends on the speaker design. A speaker can cap the voltage with a small circuit. It still sounds like shit for exactly the same reason but it won't cause any damage.

 On the positive side, you don't have to see the players you've cut every day.  




 CharlieKillsRats has the only correct answer so far.

Look at this way:  Imagine you're a widget craftsman making widgets in your garage. You're not in any debt and you make a decent living producing 1 widget a day. Now imagine that you're also a cool dude that has always paid his bills on time so tons of people want to give you money so you can build a factory and hire workers, and they only want a couple points interest because you're so trustworthy. You will increase your earnings 10X, maybe 100X, and you're going to employ a whole bunch of people. You'd be stupid not to take the money.

That's the U.S. economy to the outside world. Except they are willing to accept as little as 0.22% interest (that's actually the 1 year t-bill rate right now).

The difference between countries like the U.S. and Germany as opposed to many other "first world" countries is that the U.S. actually does a great job converting debt into production. This encourages more people to invest, which accelerates the productivity, keeps standard of living high and interest rates low. 




 The two things that the amplifier supplies the speaker is voltage level and frequency. When you play too loud, it's not the frequency that is too high for the speaker but the voltage level.

Frequency determines how quickly the speaker cone moves back and forth creating low pitch (slow oscillation) or high pitch (fast oscillation). The voltage level determines how *FAR* the speaker moves during the oscillation, which determines how loud or soft the sound is.

If the amplifier overdrives the speaker, distortion happens because the speaker cone can't go any further, i.e. it maxes out. Instead of the air molecules moving in a smooth wave, there are sharp corners. These sharp corners don't sound good. 




 I was a non-teaching male coach of the girls soccer program at a Catholic high school, and I'm not even Catholic. So I was as outside as can be. I was an assistant when the previous head coach retired and that's how I got the job. Winning a couple of state championships and having a nationally ranked team didn't hurt either.

1. Get a teacher on staff to be a liaison. This is invaluable. They help arrange buses, get grades to you, take care of last minute changes, help get the word out, and their room is a place to hold meetings and for kids to put stuff or hang out while waiting for games to start.

2. Since you're not at the school full time, it's hard for parents to come to you so go out of your way to make yourself available to parents. Find some way to have weekly "office hours."

3. Plan. Plan. Plan. Set your game and practice schedule as early as possible. Arrange the buses. Have it in writing and published to the school and parents.

4. Get good team parents (team moms, if you aren't PC). Have them handle parental liaison as much as possible:  Fundraising, uniform orders, team dinners, barbecues, playoff special events.

5. Make sure you go to all the athletic staff meetings. The other teacher-coaches will appreciate you more. Go to their games and support them. Be a part of the school, not just your particular team. You score big points when parents and students see you in the crowd as a supporter.

6. Make sure you thank the teachers that help you or come to your games. They will in turn support your players in school. This is huge for the kids and since you're not a teacher there, they aren't going to get those platitudes from you during the day.

6. I'm sure I'll think of more....

 Eye contact.



And nice legs. 




 No, the photo will be out of focus for everyone because it was out of focus on the film plane due to your manual focusing without wearing glasses.

The viewfinder should have a diopter adjuster to let you compensate for this. If you wear your glasses you should also push back the rubber cup around the viewfinder so your eyeball is about the same distance away as without glasses. 




 Helmets only reduce surface injuries like fractures, lacerations and contusions. They do very little to reduce brain injuries because that occurs when the brain impacts the inside of the skull.

If you hit your head hard enough to cause a concussion, all that force will get transmitted to your brain regardless of whether you have a helmet on or not. You may not crack your skull though, so that's good enough reason to wear a helmet. 




 Emails are fine but are easier to brush aside so follow up if you don't hear from them. 




 Normally aspirated (ie non-turbo) car engines get their power from compression and so are sensitive to ambient air pressure. Aircraft engines do not. They get their thrust from ignition exhaust. To understand why airplanes work better at 40,000 feet, you have to understand how they fly.

There is a relationship between thrust, drag, altitude and ground speed. Lift causes drag and to keep an airplane in the air, you must have enough thrust to overcome that drag. A plane's cruising *airspeed* for any given burn rate is the same regardless of the altitude. What changes with altitude is *ground speed*. (Disregarding winds)

At lower altitudes, the air density is high thus creating a lot of drag which slows down the plane and results in lower ground speed. At higher altitudes and lower air density, the drag is significantly lower thus allowing the aircraft to fly at a much faster ground speed. 30,000-40,000 feet are well within the normal abilities of the engine to maintain cruise and climb.

TL;DR:  Airplanes get thrust from igniting fuel in a combustion chamber, not from compression. Less drag at 40,000 feet from lower air density means faster ground speed, less flying time and less fuel burned on the trip.

Me:  Private pilot. 




 If you're a franchisee, a gift card sale doesn't go to your bottom line. It's net-zero because the cost of goods is 100%--all of it goes to corporate. They will reimburse you when you actually sell a grande latte. So in other words, you sell gift cards as a duty to the franchise even though you don't make a dime from it unless it's stipulated contractually that you get some percentage. 




 Ignore the ads. Even advertised jobs are likely to go to somebody who knows somebody. Seriously, large companies always have openings that aren't currently advertised, or they can make one for somebody who they like.

If you're terrified, tell them so. Say "I just got in town and I found your company. I really like your culture but coming in here to talk to you is something that would normally terrify me." Nothing wrong with that.

Good luck, and let me know how it goes! 




 Humans are social creatures. Humor greases social interaction and gets you in the club/clan/whatever. Subjective humor is just adapting humor to a community whose culture may "get it" whereas others may not.

Example:  Fart humor isn't subjective. It's always funny. /r/watchpeopledie may be funny to a group who would likely get along with each other fairly well, but not very funny to others.
