 This art looks rather like 100% real TVshop ad. I don't asses scientific side of the thing but ultimaeye website could for sure in tvshop. And this link in reddit has value = 17.5 kupvotes X $5.99 per/app (FOR LIMITED TIME ONLY) = 104.825$ . Not so bad for this type of marketing. 

















































 to be honest guys this thing doesn't look like 3D printer - I would say it's an old plotter
so next guy can hack 3D printer for ping pong player and beat the Chinese  














 doesn't work :( 




 I prefer castAR - for the price and the technology  









 soon will be available live satvideo - you can archive it for yourself  




 shouldn't  we ban this f...ing manufactures? 
they just try to put their hand deeper in our pocked in way we don't noticed this 




 28 hours to go 





























 try to hold you breath for 5 min to discover what your body have to say about safeness of CO2. 




 CO2 from fizzy drink finally end up in your liver after pass the guts. And than start making trouble for breathing cells. CO2 is  a bit toxic so better drink it flat. 




 You have still big problem with rising concentration of carbon dioxide in you lungs - what make you filling like you are drowning. 




 Remember Marcin, you have to develop extract process for it! You could say: look how much we have hydrogen in the oceans let use it us clean energy for good of all mankind!  But devil siting in details. 




 bravo, we support you! 




 I assume you aren't farm boy - so, you should be very careful before you make you decision how you going to do farm work (unless it recreation farm). 
After my graduation I used to be an organic farmer and most important lesson I'd learn was that you don't need PhD or graduation to do this job even more this is mostly useless balance and even simpleton farm boy was much better on this area then me.  
Really small changes what, how, and when you doing could have really big impact for effects.
How to start?  Every thing depend what you decided to growing on your farm, will be this some sort of organic, permaculture production?

I don't want to criticized Marcin's achievement (they did great job) but their farming set isn't ready yet - first you couldn't do all sort of farming jobs on your fields, second: as I came a cross information from replicants, tractor need some sort of repairing wheels after less then 20 miles of run on the road (where it have much less to do than on the field) - (if I'm wrong or miss understanding some info: Marcin, please correct me quickly). I hope they are going to test this sets on the their fields this year - it's spring perfect time for that. And if you couldn't count on some donations you have to concentrate on production where efficiency is the master.
Building community - that's very interesting but much more complicated then starting farming from scratch. Believe me, even here I got my own experience (my idea to organic farming doesn't come from blue sky).

If you interesting in subjects I only just touched, let me know - I'll be more then happy to help you.
 




 it's not necessary to be such negative dude! 
Do you like to give strong, controversial opinion with little knowledge about subject? 




 Marcin, I got a question about microhouse - why you guys make so complicated carpentry job for it? I hope you still here and in the future you will be able to spare couple hours per week/month/or something   for little chat like today. I have to add I appreciate what you done however in some points I got different opinions. 




 I'm sorry for that. Several years ago I had accident at work - I lose a finger tip. The worst thing was when docs wanted cat off half of the rest - to make me better - treating me that later they will amputate whole. I refused. After 2-3 weeks I went back to work. 
I;m afraid your father hand will be  very, very over sensitive. Up to 3 years each touch this place is really unpleasant.  



















 What is sens for virus to carry antibiotics resistance gen? Attacked cell will be destroyed anyway doesn't matter of antibiotics presence.  




 As far as I now antibiotics works only against bacteria.  For viruses is another class of antivirus drugs. 




 great link thx 
























 yep, it's rare disease and still 40 million Americans suffer from it. So, how many got to suffer to be common illness? 




 So, it's look like for me:  - if you got pain in your foot - they can amputate you leg, if you got headache they can cut your head off. 
Brilliant treatment.  














 you can use this as downlink and 2.5GHz(or so) wireless as uplink cos most of data is downloaded. Speed down on virgin broadband is 30Mbps and up only 2Mbps. Maybe in USA suburbs is not a problem but I got in UK constantly 17 different  wireless in my range and as I remember 2.5GHz band has 11 channels but only 3 are independent. That's mean if you can see more then 3 you have overlapping transmissions.
