 Every department pays differently. Attractions isn't that great. 

We get some evenings during the holidays for just CMs. Grad Nites suck ass... but we have had them since the 50's and yes we run all the rides from 10p-3a. 




 Yes I do :)

It was simple. I came down here for school and already knew I wanted to work here. I applied online (disney.com/careers) and a week later I'm hired. 

I specifically work in attractions and in guest show operations. I work at the World Famous Jungle Cruise and Big Thunder Mountain. At guest show operations, I make sure that the parades and fireworks go smoothly from the guests' point of view and I guest interact all day and get to "make magic" as we say. It's wonderful.

It's not hard to be cheerful because it's freaking Disneyland. Mostly everyone is having an extremely good time. I come to work after breaking up with my girlfriend of 4 years and get lost in the show of Disneyland... which is an extremely good thing. Walt made Disneyland to do just that, have it's inhabitants forget about the outside world. 

I actually hear more funny things from adults! The other night at guest show operations (GSO) I was talking to a group of middle aged women and we were shooting the breeze and joking and laughing. The apparent leader said "Michael, we are romance novel writers and we want to write a story about a strong male Asian lead now!" I couldn't stop laughing all night.
Once I had a very foreign Asian man walk up to me outside the Jungle Cruise asking for the King Kong ride (which is at Universal Studios) with a California Adventure (the adjoining park to Disneyland) map.  




 Not this weekend, sorry man! It's down for about a week. Making some safety changes. 




 I'll say them like this:
The "friends" of the characters like Mickey and Minnie that walk around and take pictures, are mainly women except for the tall ones like Goofy.

There is a basketball hoop at the top of the Matterhorn (fact).

In retail, if a CM says "customer" they are referring to shoplifters.  




 I'm going to say this in terms of attractions (which is my line of business), but it also applies to retail, food, outdoor vending, etc. 

You get hired into a certain location. In attractions, you get either Tomorrowland, New Orleans/Critter Country, Fantasyland/Toontown, and Adventureland/Frontierland/Main Street USA (The Best). 
You are "landlocked," and are only allowed to learn the attractions in your area. If you wish to go to a different area, you may, but you would lose your seniority and knowledge from the current area.

So you hire in at a hire-in attraction, something easy and not too dependent on fast paced thinking or experience. Then once you accrue seniority and rapport, you may cross train to other attractions. For instance, I get to work at Big Thunder Mountain, The Jungle Cruise, and Parades next week over a five day period.  




 Have fun over there... but when you're ready for some real magic, come to the west coast!

 I really enjoyed the World Showcase at Epcot. As for a specific ride, I really enjoyed the really cheesy Great Movie Ride in MGM Studios and also the Rockin Rollercoaster. All great rides that play to all sorts of audiences and audience wishes.  




 I've been a Disneyland enthusiast ever since I was little. I went to WDW (Walt Disney World) for the first time in May 2011. I loved the originality and innovation and execution of Epcot and Animal Kingdom. I really didn't like Magic Kingdom and MGM Studios. 

It's such a large place... it's an event park hopping. At Disneyland, it's not like that. You walk 100 paces to get to the adjoining park.  




 On these guys, I sized down one. This was with the intention of curing them myself... as in like fading and all that stuff. So I did that, I cold soaked to get rid of the excess dye and wore them for 8mo hardcore before any problems occurred (see my comment below).
The cinch is what sold me at first. It was really neat. However, the more I wore them, the less I felt a need to call attention to the cinch and the more it just became a thing for me to enjoy.  




 I purchased these denims on two separate occasions. I spent 8mo in my first pair (which I came across in a shop in San Francisco) until I busted a whole in the crotch. It was a tragedy.... so I went back and luckily they still had bigger sizes (I wear a 36) and so I bought the last two pairs in my size they had. 
At this point in my style life, I was really into curing my denim on my own. I was into APC first, then PBJ, then Samurai, then I tried LVC and loved them. 
As far as I know, they only make indigo. It's all I had. And for the record, my third pair is still alive and look awesome. I should post a pic... 




 This exact pair of denim. 




 I have 3 pairs of these. Take care of them and they'll take care of you!  




 Whoa.... 




 More like... it's a hard dock life....

 I like America's Got Talent :( 




 Let me just take a picture of these two random strangers who are sleeping peacefully... FOR KARMA. 




 The problem you may encounter with wearing patterned pants is playing them out. A good colored chino can do you some good... like maroon or dark green. 









 And you are friends on FB with a sixth grader. Chris_Hansen.jpeg 




 Only guy in my fraternity who doesn't drink yet. I have not met someone like this GGG yet.  




 At first I thought you were talking about the fact that it looks like she's taking a huge shit under her chair. 




 It's really funny to click on the link, then clicking again to zoom. 




 I have not laughed so hard in a long time. 




 Andy Bernard/Ed Helms? 




 "Stay there. Don't fucking move. I need to take a picture for Reddit." 









 "Thank you. Please try again." 




 Did this make anyone else's skin crawl? Yuck. 




 Hitting the Bernie. 




 This is more effective than my AA meetings. 




 No. But I'll upvote for OW. 




 On behalf of my race, I apologize.  




 This reminds me of Justin Bieber's recent [run in with the cops]( http://cdn03.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/06/06/Justin-Bieber-Gets-Pulled-Over-for-Speeding-in-LA-2-400x300.jpg) 









 Your wife is very beautiful, otisshredding!

 Things that will never happen to me. 




 My first laugh of the day, thank you! 





























 NNmagic is as legit as it gets my friend. 









 You don't know my life. You don't know my struggles. 




 "Do I belong here?" 
CUZ I LIVE IN A CREEEEK, I'M AN OTTER. WTF AM I DOING HERE? I DON'T BELONG HERE. 




 I don't get why this comment got downvoted to oblivion.  




 I'm happy for her. Like I said its not like I walk in and see this and say "Yay mom!" 




 Haha interesting point. My mom is a single mom and we talk freely about sex without too many details thankfully, but it's not like I'm giving my mom a high five for wanting to dance on a pole for old men.  









 Hence the red arrow.  









 They really outdid themselves with the artwork on the bicycle ass. I'm blown away. 




 Who the fuck would tattle? 




 More like Zack Snyder (300, Sin City, Sucker Punch, etc.) 




 I love pictures like that.

 I see y'all are... dealing with it... pretty well. :) 




 Reverse psychology... DUH. 




 Those pillows are full of fart.  




 Here's the original for anyone that cares:

 Because we have friends. 




 The "pretending to be asleep" face. Classic. 









 NoMo is amazing. Henley and Pralle are like hotels. You are not allowed to chill around... you need to be inside at all time if you want to chill (basically). At NoMo, doors can be open, you can walk up and down the aisle and meet different people or ask people for things or chill inside the quad which is in the middle of the housing. Really awesome, I didn't even live there last year. 




 Thanks! No bragging but occasionally me or my friends get cat called or get numbers passed to us but we never solicit, even though I'm tempted sometimes admittedly.  




 Know how to use fast pass. Know that you can ask for the front row on any attractions. Know that you can bring food and drink into Disneyland.  




 I only look like Grant because I'm Asian. Not opposed.

Weirdest rule... maybe that I'm not allowed to use the phrase "Olympics." I have to say "summer games" if I want to talk about them because the Olympics are owned by NBC and Disney owns ABC. 




 Neither. Just bored and thought y'all may be interested. 




 Working on it.  




 The people who do it love it. The crowds are what make it not monotonous. Each crowd responds differently. There are always new ad libs on every boat. 




 Orlando info is true. The fact that it's underground is an after thought. Pirates of The Caribbean ride at Disneyland is mostly underground for what it's worth. 

And the head info is false. 




 I dislike the Tiki Room songs more than Small World. 




 Thank you! I'm being very careful.  




 The only times I see children cry are when they are spoiled and don't get what they want from their parents (candy, toys, food), when they are too scared to ride a ride their parents are taking them on, and (most relevant to me daily) when they don't make height checks. 




 Soak in cold water first to get the dye out. If you don't like the sizing after, warm soak it for 30min. 




 I'm not saying anything that could get me terminated. 




 It may be because this is not called a Fast Pass. It's called a Guest Assistance Card. These are awesome for people that need them. All you need to do is go to Guest Relations and tell them why you need them and what your disability restricts you from doing ie standing too long. People abuse this shit all the time and it sucks. 

The card lets the holder and up to 6 guests go through the shortest route to the attraction. 




 Ohhhh yes! I couldn't tell if y'all were visiting the school and stoked about it or students. I was at Big Thunder that day. 




 I like the Remember! fireworks spectacular because it showcases the beautiful and nostalgic and classic attractions of Disneyland past and present. 

I get paid a little over $9
