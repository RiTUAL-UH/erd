 try to sound enthusiastic and upbeat when talking when i have watched fm videos the person always sounds dull and bored 




 there essentially actors  




 looks like you're one of those assholes  




 no what i ment is i dont like signing players that are really popular sorry about that  




 hey guys i try not to sign players that are really popular fierro etc beacause i try to find the gems and quality players myself and i try to stay away from the players everyone signs any of you guys feel the same ( bit of a Fm hipster i know ) 




 i agree ! 




 right now i play mostly every day and a few weeks ago i just wasnt enjoying it anymore so im taking a break untill my parents go away hopeful i will enjoy it a little more. so like 2-3 weeks 




 didnt think of that thanks ! 




 Hey guys this may sound like a dumb question but i was trying to figure out a better way to keep track if player growth and things of that nature and i was thinking of making a spreadsheet or something. do you guys have any easier ways to keep track of players growth tutoring ect i tend to never be able to read the notes i make because i have rubbish handwriting. thanks for all the help  




 never reload learn from the mistakes you have made 




 this sounds like the best idea ever 




 dunno thats kind of what im expecting  




 dont worry man one day we will right a hit song about our parents and we will make tons of money and then we will release a follow up and it wont be as good and we will overdose and die ! how does that sound  




 i am also that kid. it sucks 




 thanks for the advice ! 




 ah right thanks for the advice appreciate it ! 




 whats Dbs ? 




 any idea how to make football manager run quicker i play it on a laptop and is sometimes slow and says (not responding) any ideas how to make it run quicker  




 Haha well you said it in a kind of funny charming way so you're okay for now 




 thanks for the advice and the help means a lot thanks again :) 




 you're an asshole 




 its really sad i cant believe that guy what an asshole 




 thanks mate means a lot ! 




 i dont think its Xavis problem i think that since the 2010-2011 season the team hasn't evolved there main starting 11 has pretty much stayed the seam where as teams like bayern and dortmund have added strength in depth and have added a lot of players so they can progress Eg. dumping 42 goal striker mario gomez for mandzukic where as barca have added cesc and jordi alba the team hasn't progressed properly since that season 




 personally i don't think its a big deal when i accidentally spell argument arguement. i really don't think that's worth being a complete ass over not saying you're an ass but a lot of other people are 




 so true thanks for that ! 




 amen brother 




 yeah i know i dont try to find help but after a tough day and you wanna comment on a post and you get like some assholes being dicks  




 yeah the condescending reply was really cool man 




 its just that i like reddit and there are just so many assholes and dicks and when you just wanna say i dunno talk about a movie or something its god dam frustrating especially when your going through a rough patch like me ya know  




 i wish dating culture here in the uk was like in the us but its just not like that people dont really date a lot from what i have seen 




 ok im pissed of im sick of the way people treat eachother on here whenever i try and give my opinion or add something constructive to the post i just get hate and people criticizing my spelling is it really that big of a deal? everyone on here are always posting shitty puns to get tons of upvotes and there are just so many assholes. i have been struggling with depression a bit lately and i dont have tons of friends and whenever i try and reach out on here or whenever i try and be constructive or helpfull and i just get tons of hate for no good reason. congratz you all have tons of upvotes and you're so funny. assholes 

Edit: Thanks for all the advice and helpful words really helped me get it off my chest 




  im not even going to have the argument. fucking moron 




 why is shitty community on the list and not friends  




 yeah i was thinking it would be tough i figured 3-4 years should have wilshire ramsey ward-prowse etc up to there best 




 how Britney survived 2007 




 hmmm well luke shaw and ward prowse i will definatly get. i have always been a fan of rodriguez but dunno if he would cut it at a top 4 side 




 thanks for the advice ! 




 hey hows the weekend treating ya 




 nice what team are you  




 not sure weather to do British or english cause im playing with arsenal and they have ramsey whos welsh so im not sure 




 yeah thats what i thought because i was playing my dynamio kiev save and they have to have at least 7 starters i think. 




 never even heard of him. who is he 




 thanks for the advice mate ! 




 thats great ! lovely to hear a happy ending  




 haha thats awesome  




 did you know something would eventually happen or did it just kind of pan out that way  




 ahhh JET if only he made it at arsenal 




 hey guys first poster here and i was just wondering if you guys have met your SO in weird and unexpected circumstances  




 thanks for the advice wanted to do it with arsenal so i might check redmond out. out of redmond or tom ince who would you pick cause i quite like ince 




 redmond really ? 




 yeah i thought of ward-prowse aswell 




 hey guys really like chatting with all of you on here much prefer here to any forums. anyway i was wondering if any of you guys have tried like an all British team challenge because i was thinking of doing a save where i must have at least 7 English players in my starting 11. if so any must sign players you recommend  




 it sucks from 15-18 i loved life skating everyday always had something to do  met tons of great people through it. but went to uni :( now im sad 




 thanks for the advice might try the academy challenge. i sometimes have trouble committing to them. any teams you think would be good to use for the academy challenge  




 hey guys dont know if anyone else has experienced this but i think i have been playing the game to much because i use to be really excited about playing and use to be really excited to try new formations and clubs and buy new players but now i just dont have the motivation. any tips because i wanna get to the excited stage again  




 skating as in skateboarding dont have the time energy of the athletic ability anymore. shame because some of the best times of my life have been while skating 




 thanks for the tip i find myself carrying so many wepons and armor because of the value 




 40 grand jeeeez ! 




 woah i think we have a winner ! 




 someone once took a shit the size of a baby seal 
 




 hey guys just got skyrim a few weeks ago and im trying to get into it. any advice hints or tips when just starting off the game 




 dodgeball best comedy of all time in my view and people like it but i dont think i have ever watched it without crying from laughter  




 im pretty impressed he managed to do that. thats very impressive  




 how is that even possible haha 




 have a chat. dont have many friends because i think im a dick so a nice chat with someone new would be nice 




 ham and cheese for sure 




 seeing the bad in people rather that the good. its a quality i have and i hate it 




 so we have all seen your amazeing regens but have you had players that you had big hopes for that completely flopped 




 I think its great you have come here asking for help. But if i was you i would just learn by playing its a lot more satisfying identifying your own mistakes and learning from them and when you create successful tactics without any help or guides is very rewarding not to mention when you find that hidden gem that scores you 30 goals a season. trust me no guides and you will have a lot more fun. p.s enjoy the summer you're going to have a great time getting use to fm :)    




 glasses and witty remarks and im out man  




 definitely agree  




 i agree hugs are the best thing in the world after dogs and the mighty ducks movies that is 




 watch the 'mighty ducks' all of them. then watch the movie 'jack' 




 being from london i wish it seemed not weird to go up to strangers and talk to them, i spend so much time in london and i dont have a lot of friends i wish i could just go up to someone and go 'hey cool jacket' or something without it seeming like im a creep. i mean i love london its the greatest city in the world in my view(settle down new york) but very hostile towards eachother 
























 hey guys im trying to create a 4-2-3-1 formation with two b2b midfielders but i think it lacks a bit of defensive steel. do you guys think it can work.because im doing a save with arsenal and i wanted to make ramsey and wilshire my midfield pair but im not sure two b2b's can work 




 me too :) thanks again for your help  




 hey i unistalled it. and it still didnt work so i started a new save and it was fine. guess it was that specific save. weird  




 i dont think its terrible to believe in god. im not religious and i dont believe in god but if some people want to read stories and pray and if that makes them close with there friends and family and if that gives them rules and morals thats great. and i hate fanatical atheists more than fanatical religious people. yeah science is great but fuck off and leave everyone alone. bring on preachy atheists who wanna argue 




 will leave it for a few hours hopefully that will do it. thanks for your help 




 ok will do. i tried doing this and it was suck on 0% for ages should i just leave it for a few hours ? 




 i have 6gb of RAM and 278 of 421 free. when i play i have nothing on in the background. its very sudden and has only just got really slow in the last few days its very weird. would a system restore do anything ?  




 definitely Ronaldo with all due respect to Ribery Messi and Ronaldo are in a differant class to him. Ronaldos had such a stunning year a much better year than messi. he deserves it 




 hey guys i have not had any problems with fm at all regarding running the game. but suddenly a few days ago i load up my save and it is horrendously slow takes ages when i change anything on the tactics screen takes ages to advance forward and to play games. generally really slow and it lagging a lot. i have no issue with memory on my laptop and i have never had a problem like this before and i don't really know what i can do. any help would be appreciated 
p.s i have england as a playable league and all the other leagues as view only.  




 oh wow i always read amazing stories about people getting lower league teams to the prem and i think wow i wanna do that but i never have the commitment to compete in the lower leagues  




 wow awsome i always get bored when i start with a lower league team wish i found it fun managing lower league :( 




 wow that sounds great ! never tried to play in a league to enhance the reputation   




 hey guys big fan of this subreddit. anyway i want to hear about saves where you completely dominated winning everything for years and years. i had a good fm 13 save with arsenal i won 11 titles in 13 years 8 of them doubles 4 of them trebles and 2 of them quadruples. lemme hear you guys show of your most dominant saves !  




 Ukraine winning the World Cup in 2014 beating England 3-0 in the final  




 Winning the league and cup double with everton. In my first season  




 Get a foothold in Scandinavia some incredible talents at insanely cheap prices  




 i always prefer using youngsters but like a few people here said its better to have a mix  




 they might want a meeting with you to discuss staying  




 maybe an advanced playmaker ? 




 thats awsome ! in one save i won the title 11 times in 13 years with a two and a half star right winger he  was a very important cog in my team  




 Bendtner whenever i play with arsenal he always seems to play a decent part in my season  




 sell him mate ! (unless league rival)

 yeah i've come across quite a few atheists on here who act like a complete tosser  not saying they all do its the minority for sure. it just seems unnecessary and the post is what do you hate most about Redditors and that's what I hate most if thats ok with you that's all im saying 




 excuse me ? 




 atheists on here who go out of there way to be a dick to religious people yeah im not religious and i don't believe in any of that stuff but i understand it helps some people live there lives and it helps some people be a good person. leave them alone for fuck sake 




 quoting anchorman every two fucking posts. '60 percent of the time it works everytime' fuck off  




 oh sorry mate i get annoyed easily my fault ! yeah i was just looking for tips but would be feel better if i did it myself i guess haha ! sorry again i have a short fuse  




 this seems like an unnecessarily dickish response  




 its ok actually i will just try and figure it out by myself  




 friend pissed himself infront of two super hot girls.  




 haha i do get a smug look from  people at footie nowadays ! 




 dortmund away shirt with gotze one the back two days before his move was announced that cost me like 60 quid dammit
