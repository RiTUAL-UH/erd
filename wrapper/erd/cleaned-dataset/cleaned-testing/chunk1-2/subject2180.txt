 "because I didn't hear anyone saying any of these in this video? Please, quote me where people have said this." 
I'm sorry but at what point did we relegate this only to the video, you brought up sjw's on tumblr, i assumed we are referencing all instances  including campaigns and instances outside of the video?

"o... do you think that coercion does not count as sexual assault? Because if so, holy shit."

the practice of persuading someone to do something by using force or threats.
"it wasn't slavery because no coercion was used" welp i really used the wrong word in this context, i apologize, i was thinking of persuasion not coercion. It is shown in my original post that the definition i used for coercion does not correlate to how coercion is defined, but yes coercion would be under every definition rape, i agree with this, but persuading your partner to have sex no i do not believe so. 

"Falsely reporting a crime is already a crime. Does falsely reporting rape need to be an extra super special crime? You don't see why this might make people afraid to actually report rapes out of fear that they'll be unfairly accused?"

No it's not, what are you talking about? falsely filing a police report is a crime, falsely reporting a rape even if it is later found not to be true is not remotely criminalized, if you retract your claims they wont charge, if you file a police report, go to court and he is found guilty and later own you retract your statement he will be freed but you still will not get charged, their are actual instances of this occuring, like the highschool football player falsely accused and who went to jail for ten years, while his accuser ended up suing the school district and won, she does not have to repay, the court system has never even attempted to go after her, she got 5 million dollars from the state in tax payers dollars and wasted another couple of thousand by having the state incarcerate an innocent man. 

Wow if you think that false accusations of rapes are actually prosecuted you're extremely delusional. Rape culture, the only culture where men can be accused of rape and immediately have their life ruined yet women still think society is unfairly victimizing rape victims, i think rape is the only crime where a person does not need to provide evidence, testify or show any facts concerning the crime yet somehow their is a high chance the accused will be sent to prison. 

 




 I love this, lets ignore the statement and then ask who is saying this, if i have never heard of it, your point is invalid. Seriously you never heard of the yes does not mean yes campaign? seriously i have a friend in the uk, feminist was telling me rape laws were not inclusive and they need to add more definitions like how being coerced into sex(if your partner badgers you but you don't feel like it, his continued persistence even if you're reluctant) should be considered a form of sexual assault, how regret should be considered valid.

In false accusations should be punished extensively, you can't declare rape is a serious crime and then allow the false reporting of rape to continue, you're making a mockery of rape, you're basically saying rape is the worse crime a woman can endure but it's perfectly fine if another woman lies about rape and deliberately hurting how actual rapes will be treated in the future, has no one ever read a boy cried wolf, same concept applies.

 




 So they did a recent study a few months back, most male on male relations are consensual not forced.  




 But that makes little sense, you're saying that rape culture is based off of men feeling entitled to women's bodies but in reality is the opposite of this, while there are the dbags who think they're Adonises and can get any woman they want, most guys have to work towards just being liked by the average woman, that's why men who can repeatedly have sex with women are seen as an example of something to emulate and admire.

The pickup artist crowd, the guys like the dude who shot up that school because women did not pay attention to him, those are the jerks who believe they're entitled to women by right of being a man, but you can go up to any guy, say wanna have sex and they will feel like they won the lottery and are at that moment king of the world.

 




 Call bullshit, the new world made Spain the most envied nation in Europe, everybody wanted a piece of that pie.  




 Proxy implies we were fighting on behalf of another power, ie France or Spain, both allies in the revolution, which is not factual, in fact France wanted and believed it would gain territory after the war ended(been awhile since I looked this up) but we kind of screwed them over when we made peace with general Cornwallis.  




 Why would Tunisia care? Hannibal barca was Carthaginian which were a Phoenician people, Phoenicia was in modern day Lebanon where their descendants(estimated to be around 20% of the population) reside, their closet relatives would be the Hebrews(ancient Hebrew/Phoenician languages were mutually intelligible, the kingdom of Israel and Phoenicia formed a trading empire together, both were conquered by Assyria and their is speculation that Hebrew writing script derives from Phoenician) so in reality Lebanon and possibly Israel?

Would be the ones not amused. 




 They already do dbag, this guys is more humanized then you treat the israeli's? what about the decades the israeli's have suffered, the lynched soldiers in ramallah? the jews beat and killed for being jews? the israeli's are not the dehumanizing aspects.  




 Yeah i know but i thought it added to the overall title it's more of a play on the struggle is real meme. 




 Palestinian hamas leader khaled meshaal is currently suffering from the trauma,exhaustion and pressure of being the leader of an oppressed, besieged people during the recent war of israeli zionist occupation and aggression. Here he is currently sitting in a gym in nice part of Qatar as another ceasefire was horribly broken by Israel after the brave and glorious  martyr's of the Palestinian captured an Israeli soldier for the first time since this conflict began. 32 Palestinian people have been killed so far in this recent flare up. Please spread this, pray for the innocent gazans and this horribly oppressed leader. The world can not stay blind to the oppressed people of Palestine and their elected officials. LOOK AT THAT BELLY THE MAN IS STARVING! 









 The last time israel allowed in constructions material was about a year ago, they used it to build a terror tunnel into israel. These are the same people who used piping and waste to build rockets.  




 I'm talking about the second intifida.  




 Listen my bad. I get what you're saying the narrative of a freedom fighter is someone else's terrorist is a great point. Even in america after they won the war of independence which we in the us consider the great american revolution many slaves who would of been granted freedom 40 years earlier then they did under if not right after the war had Britain won i'm sure probably consider the american patriots terrorist. Hell the op himself considers the political establishment a problem but believes the military wing are freedom fighters. I can cite the fact they deliberately target kids but he will consider them always to be patriots for their national cause. 

I get that. I understand. I'm just saying from my perspective on why i do not even looking from a Palestinian narrative could consider them either political or paramilitary wise freedom fighters. But that's just my  opinion. In no i'm not an Israeli, i'm an american from chicago southside. Don't want to go into details but lets just say, my mom would of slapped me had i not voted for obama in 2012 lolz. Honestly if i was an israeli... ok not going to say it might just come of as propaganda or biased but if you want look up the israeli left side of the conflict. It seems the jews by and large are more pro-pali then pro-israel so eh. But anyway have a nice day.   




 Bro you need to read the context of my post before spouting off. You clearly posted a point about kids writing their names on missiles then inferred they would be targeted at kids like them, which is not the case. Those missiles are not being targeted for children but Hamas(in the kids who die are not intentional, not even the most biased news sources state such things, unless you live in switzerland or something more then likely you know what collateral deaths are don't try to act like everything that occurs in war is completely intentional), while i may not agree with the idea of pride in your national military forces or patriotism it's entirely common for kids to be taught as such. Them signing their names is nothing different then us pilots marking jet fighters with naked women or writing slogans on their tanks, yes the inner leftist in me thinks why would you be proud of a weapon of war but we know how morale goes in any conflict. Anyway you generalized both sides hate each other, i was trying to show you by the humanitarian rights orgs(many of which are anti-israel government) such as btselem is that's not the actual case.

If i wanted to be a propagandist instead i would post vids from the idf youtube channel showing them sending food to gaza and the great humanitarian programs israel has, telling you about the stories of hamas pm grand daughter being allowed into israel for medical treatment instead i made a simple point about the conflict not being black and white. 

Secondly i never claimed they did not exist. As we understand now the Palestinian Arab people do exist, rather or not this is historically factual matters little. More then 7 million people believe they're Palestinians so they're Palestinians. In the historical context though and the origins of the national identity is what i was referring to. Secondly i never claimed any such thing jesus read my reddits correctly.

"Hamas never called ahead before sending a terrorist (not a fucking freedom fighter)
Seriously dude, it depends on perspective who is a terrorist or a freedom fighter. You are only seeing it from your perspective, try to see from other perspectives.

Ok lets look at this from the arab perspective. I'm a lesbian secular christian Palestinian arab, hamas is a radical islamist organization made up of mostly males between 20-60 with their leadership effectively 40-60 year old conservative religious males. Now please explain to me as a lesbian female living under a radical islamist government, how are they fighting for my freedom to be a lesbian and secular let alone my rights as a woman?"


I was making a point about rather or not hamas can be considered freedom fighters and if so who's freedom are they fighting for. To sunni's in iraq the isil caliphate could be considered freedom fighters but to their fellow shia they're barbaric terorrist whereas to some sunni these guys are nothing but pure thugs etc. Please understand context.

No need to insult me friend. BTW if i was a propogandist i would not put "zion" in my name. That kind of gives me away as a mossad israeli puppet who is trying to promote propoganda:)

 




 Explain to me one good thing they have accomplished then in concerns to the freedom of the Palestinian people? in your point makes no since, how are they fighting for my freedom if i am a Palestinian and apart of these people. How are they representing me? any body can say they fight for the people hell china's army is called the People's liberation army does not mean people in tibet feel liberated. Yeah but here's the difference, even  the worst extremist in israel like lets irgun/lehi who's members like begin later became israel's pms.

Begin for instance was an extremist going by a narrative he could be considered a heroic freedom fighter or a terrorist. But his actions deliberately attributed to the modern israeli state, a state in which he as pm ended the between israel,egypt and jordan. A state where now arabs can live in a secular democracy albeit they're still problems but this state does have equality. If hamas is to be called freedom fighters whose freedom are they for?  




 Wait i can get paid? for being pro israel? really now? how much? are you offering? unlike you moron i'm pro-palestine/pro-israel zionist from chicago. I'm on here because i believe in peace but you seem to be biased all around and promote a agenda. How much does pallywood pay you?  









 http://www.btselem.org/
Bullshit they're hundreds of israeli ngo's name one arab ngo that supports or has sympathy for the israeli's in then you can tell me they both hate each other. Ever heard of chomsky,feinstein?mondoweiss? why are jews the main ones calling for peace and yet the arabs call for deaths of jews?

Look at this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_Peace_massacre
The perpetrator was Jordanian Army Corporal Ahmed Daqamseh, who stated that he attacked because he was insulted and angered that the girls were whistling and clapping while he was praying.[12][1]

Speaking on Al Jazeera in May 2001, Daqamseh's mother said, "I am proud of my son, and I hold my head high. My son did a heroic deed and has pleased Allah and his own conscience. My son lifts my head and the head of the entire Arab and Islamic nation. I am proud of any Muslim who does what Ahmad did. I hope that I am not saying something wrong. When my son went to prison, they asked him: 'Ahmad, do you regret it?' He answered: 'I have no regrets.' He treated everyone to coffee, honored all the other prisoners, and said: The only thing that I am angry about is the gun, which did not work properly. Otherwise I would have killed all of the passengers on the bus.  




 http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-25518813 

Russians are saying. He died of aids ha just kidding but poison is proven to be false. Died of old age. Don't trust wiki it's heavily biased.  




 Bullshit op. Before the infitida you could travel to the west bank you fucked up by supporting hamas. 

 




 This no offense to the op but obviously skewed info. The Sabra and Shatila massacre was the slaughter of between 762 and 3,500 civilians, mostly Palestinians and Lebanese Shiites, by the Kataeb Party, a Lebanese Christian militia, in the Sabra neighborhood and the adjacent Shatila refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon from approximately 6:00 pm 16 September to 8:00 am 18 September 1982.

It was christian phalangist not sharon. Op please don't be biased. In he is a refugee due to the refusal of lebanon to make him a citizen.

In there were weapons next to the kid.  




 Because this aid ship was not really an aid ship but basically a militant organization, the commandos were armed with paintball guns and got horribly ambushed and beat by these "activist" don't believe the media hype it's all lies. 

Anyway israel allowed gaza in tons of concrete and they built a terror tunnel. Now they're allowing it in. http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/10/14/israel-blocks-construction-materials-from-gaza-after-terror-tunnel-discovery/
http://www.jta.org/2014/01/26/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/israel-to-allow-more-construction-material-into-gaza
 




 This is even worse. It ignores the simple fact even when it was not a jewish state you had conflict, go back to the nebu musa riots of the 1920's and the hebron massacre. Israel has 1.2 million israeli arabs, many of these people are sitting on the knesset like haneen zoabi yet she campaigns for the destructing of israel never mind she is only allowed to speak due to the jewish democracy. An arab majority state(not being racist) would be crap, not only for the arabs but for the jews also.

They would immediately vote on a constitution based somewhat on islamic principles and beliefs basically sharia law. The democracy would be a majority democracy, which is inherently flawed. Look at rome, look at how dictators like Caesar and before him sulla. They used the mob to their advantage to cause chaos and control the senate. Later own in america our forefathers realizing this decided against a democracy in favor of a republic. 

Allowing the arabs to control israel would not only effectively end israel it would end the jewish homeland ideals, the main point of israel is to be a jewish state free of persecution of jews and centuries of anti-semitism. This state would probably end up being a theocracy like iran or end up a corrupt nation under a dictatorship like syria or egypt. Secondly israel agreed to the partition plan(it was not offered by the arabs but the un) which would be multi-ethnic. The arabs refused.  




 Sorry but that does not add up to facts. The arabs decimated their own greenhouses and economic prosprity, then they later beg the jews to help them run the new green houses. The arabs always get second chances and they f up.

Um no allot of anti-semitism exist from the pro palestine crowd. In they don't mean the jews. http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-09-13/palestinian-israeli-jews-future-state-israel-PLO/50394882/1

Especially in the west this jew hatred continues by arab immigrants.  




 The rest was owned by the british,turks or absentee arab land owners. If your grand dad has a certificate, talk to an israeli ngo, bring it to the supreme court, it's chaired by a israeli arab(i believe a muslim or druze). If it's valid you can move back. This is what 90% of arabs like to ignore, israel has a proper justice system, the israeli's also keep plots of land open for arab land owners in jerusalem or parts of israel i believe. At worse you may need to simply accept compensation. 




 It's really complicated, they don't wanna give Palestinians passport cause they want them to go back to their country. Palestinians in Lebanon don't even have the right to own anything or even work in public fields... You can read more about this online.. its really terrible.."

Scroll up this is from another palestenian user from lebanon, lebanon refues them citizenship, career access and other basics that could help improve their situation so that they can continuously be used as a way to keep international opinion against israel at the same time keep their populaces distracted from what they do that's usually even worse. Look it up.  




 This is  the part where gazan bias comes in. Israel never stole your water. Israel is the reason the region has water. The gas they speculated and found is there gas. You can have tourist from the egyptian side but they refuse to open the border. Israel stole your sand? seriously 0-0


Because the coastal plain of Judea samaria had few water resources, Theodor Herzl already envisioned the transfer of water from the Jordan River to the coast for irrigation and drinking water supply. In order to realize that Zionist vision, the water company Mekorot was created in 1937, more than a decade before the creation of the state of Israel. In the first two decades of Israel's existence, substantial financial resources were dedicated to create the National Water Carrier, a complex water supply system including the Shiloach Pipeline along the Burma Road to Jerusalem built during the 1948 ArabIsraeli War, a first pipeline to the Negev in 1955 and the transfer of water from the Sea of Galilee in 1964. Furthermore Mekorot began a Rain Enhancement program in 1961, increasing rainfall by 13%-18%. Also, a Brackish Water Pipeline was completed in 1965 to divert brackish ground water from infiltrating the Sea of Galilee.

Water reclamation (1970s and 80s)[edit]


Drinking water being collected by hand in Neot Mordechai c. 1947
In 1969 the Shafdan wastewater treatment plant south of Tel Aviv was completed to treat approximately 130 million cubic meters of wastewater per year for reuse in agriculture. However, wastewater from other cities and towns remained largely untreated. In 1970 there was a cholera outbreak because of illegal irrigation of salad with untreated wastewater. This gave rise to major investments in wastewater treatment under the National Sewerage Plan, which emphasized the reuse of treated wastewater. In 1984 the Kishon wastewater treatment plant was completed in Northern Israel, It provides 20 million cubic meters of treated wastewater per year for agricultural use in the fertile Jezreel Valley, maximizing distribution potential during high-demand periods.

Signing of water sharing agreements (1990s)[edit]
The 1995 Interim Agreement as part of the Oslo Peace Process provided certain quantities of water to the Palestinians, but prevents them from drilling any new wells in the Mountain Aquifer. The surface water of the Jordan River remains disputed with Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians. Only with Jordan Israel was able to reach an agreement on the sharing of water resources in 1995 as part of the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty. 

Israel provided the water in the first place. A full decade before the creation of israel. No offense but you guys refused oslo and israel still gives you their water.

 This is ignorant af. First off the jews never came to anyone's land and told them to go. The original zionist bought the land from absentee turkish/arab land owners, the majority of the land outside of that belonged to the british authority. Even know arabs still sell land and are prosecuted(even killed) for doing it. The average arab "land" owners living in the land was irreverently small to be a joke. Actually yes. Arabs like haj amin husseini recruited for the waffen ss gathering bosnian muslimss divisions, the ss were the main jew hunters in eastern europe. He was so successful by the end of ww2 it was 60% non german.  




 Ok lets look at this from the arab perspective. I'm a lesbian secular christian Palestinian arab, hamas is a radical islamist organization made up of mostly males between 20-60 with their leadership effectively 40-60 year old conservative religious males. Now please explain to me as a lesbian female living under a radical islamist government, how are they fighting for my freedom to be a lesbian and secular let alone my rights as a woman?          




 Um how do you stop a bomb that's already in place and a previous attack was actually stopped by the jewish authority. The brits who had a military HQ there refused to evacuate.  




 Falafel, hummus, and shwarma aren't Palestinian culture. 

 *filfal, from Aramaic pilpl, "small round thing, peppercorn," derived from palpl, "to be round, roll". Thus in origin, falafel would be "rollers, little balls." 

Besides it dates to middle-eastern jews and egyptians.  




 This is incorrect. The jewish peple settled in the land in the 1800's under theodr herzl. Groups of arabic nomads and bedouin were the only people left in the region until more arabs showed up with the return of the jews, not being racist but yes the arabs believed that if the jews returned that the land would prosper and they could get paid by working for them. It's culturally ingrained by people to believe jews have money and can turn anything into a paradise. Which they did... 

Anyway these people living in the mandate of palestine eventually by the british came to be known as palestenians, the only people who identified as this however were jews. The arabs got offended and declared themselves southern syrians. In 48 after 2 decades starting in 1921 with the neba musa riots(jerusalem) in which a man by the name of haj amin husseini tried to eradicate the jewish immigrants living in the land. Shit got cray cray, the jews set up defense forces like haganah, the arabs kept trying to exterminate the jews like during the 1929 palestine riots, the jaffa and hebron riots etc till the point where the jews got tired of there shit in started their own paramilitaries since the british(who controlled the mandate) refused to protect the jews. Something about antisemitism being an ingrained right of people. So the jews developed orgs like stern gang,irgun and lehi. Jewish extremist groups. These groups then basically went on an all out back and forth tug of war between the jews,arabs and the british forces. The arabs killed jews, the jews killed arabs in return, the brits stepped in, got both arabs and jews killed or ignored it, in turn the jews/arabs killed the brits. 

The mainstream zionist authority tried to keep the paramilitaries at bay and calm, which never worked out, they cooperated and helped the british authority. Eventually the brits after getting tired and ww2 coming and going. Decided to let the newly formed un handle this "palestine" situation. The un mandated a partition plan where the jews would get 45% of the land, this land would be about 40% percent jewish and 50% arab. This was in the negev mostly and along the coast. Arabs would get 55% along with some 15,000 jews. With jerusalem now officially being a un mandate governed city. The jews agreed thankful to get this and arabs said hell no. They launched a war and lost to the jewish forces holding their ground. For 20 years jordan/egypt occupied the land allocated for the arabs, after israel retook this territory, the plo formed by egyptian born arafat. They took the name the jews discarded when they founded the jewish state of israel and began a war against the jewish statehood. Since that point we have a palestine national caused based on a political ploy nothing more nothing less.


Way back on March 31, 1977, the Dutch newspaper Trouw published an interview with Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee member Zahir Muhsein. Here's what he said:

The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism. 




 Simply put. Their not claiming your "land" they're claiming the ancestral home of the jewish people. As exemplified by the numerous jewish artifacts,holy sites,cultural sites and historical evidence that points to it being a Jewish state. The country of israel was founded not by religious orthodox jews, ben gurion, theodr herzl and the rest were all atheist/secular jewry. Biblically speaking the most religious jews are anti-israel believing only the messiah can create a jewish statehood, which is why whenever you see an orthodox jew at a pro-palestine rally they're usually the radical guys who don't have a problem chilling next to the former iranian president who host holocaust denial events. They're also the reason why you hear about little girls being spit on and women told to sit on at the back of the bus. They're firmly anti-zionist.
Zionism is exclusively about giving the jewish people a homeland to free them from centuries of antisemitism. 

Hell golda meir the first female pm of israel had this to say in concerns to moses.

"Let me tell you something that we Israelis have against Moses. He took us 40 years through the desert in order to bring us to the one spot in the Middle East that has no oil" 
























 Sir. That's not nice. Your wife is a very nice lady just ask the mailman, pool boy and gardener. 




 Then why are you complaining. Exclusives are a reality, it happens on all platforms. The entire concept of this subreddit is about how your platform is better and more exclusionary compared to console peasants just seems kind of hypocritical to be mad about console segregation when this is what the subreddit stand for and that we're better then the console peasants.  









 You're on PCmasterrace complaining about console segregation. Really? that's the entire purpose of pc masterrace, you're just mad it's on xbox.  




 Regardless of rather or not they were looking for the one shit starter, the men dealt with their issues, unless the women were all chosen because of their personality or lack thereof it could be used as representative. Not to a fault but close enough, i'm pretty sure if the producers chose women who were bitchy they also chose men the same way but still one group overcame this.  




 This was years ago around when i was 10 or 11, it was at this go kart track in Wisconsin dells. Family vacation, me, my sister and her boyfriend were all racing on the track, we were really into it, i love go kart racing and we got extremely competitive between the three of us. I sped ahead, leaning into the curves, began meticulously taking out the kids who all seemed to be Suburban tourist from bumfuck Dakota. I would ram their carts, knock them into walls and do my best to spin them out, i turned a simple go kart race with kids who some were 8 years old or younger into a mix between mario kart racing and death race. At one point i ended up in a fender bender with a kid i purposefully rammed so hard. I was young so i don't remember the extent of the damages but he either suffered a concussion or whiplash. In my defense i was a huge fan of mario, i was go karting and i could not help but get my head into that perspective blame the video games not me!!

Suffice it to say the people who run the track were not please, me and my sis being city kids could care less though. It was the dells, there were a dozen other go kart tracks across the street and within a 2 block walking distance. We cursed them out and walked off, they told us never to come back, we did eventually and they for some reason were still mad,my mom later heard of this in was.... extremely dis-pleasured.

TL:DR Went off into a mario kart trance, gave kid whiplash, cursed out go kart operators and strutted away like a dbag. Mom whooped my butt.  




 Sup fellow 9 goaters, kick out all 6 goaters they can't reddit with us.  









 She's not bi, the imgur did not even explain that fully. She was pretending to be bi, you know like lindsay lohan and miley cyrus. Magic powder is not drugs, jesus it's a trope of fantasy with love potions and magic spells. Read it fully and stop trying to get pissed off over nothing.  














 Isn't it said that we lived in such a self absorbed word where we believe anyone gives a fuck about your MLP fetish or weird porn searches. The list is a lie eat cake and stfu.  




 Good. Fuck your grandfather nazi dog. Sorry for your other grandfather who died who fought on the eastern front.  




 Because one was fighting to stop the imperialistic genocidal racial supremacist expansion of two empires. One being the Hitler Reich and the other being the imperial Japanese army, both who committed massive crimes against humanity. Your comparison is the equivalent to saying why is luke skywalker awesome for blowing up the death star killing thousands of imperial soldiers in the process yet imperials are guilty for blowing up alderaan. Gee idk maybe because the imperials just blew up a civilian planet that's nominally peaceful versus a planet destroying super weapon under the control of a xenophobic genocidal empire. 

Now is that a black and white comparison which is not fair since in war it's a moral gray zone? yes it's unfair but ww2 is probably the closest we can come to a black and white narrative in concerns to historical warfare. While yes the us might have it's own issues, racism, and prejudice at the time, it was not outright directly trying to exterminate entire groups of people, while it might have put Japanese citizens in concentrations camps it did not do horrific human experimentation like the japanese unit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731, it did not force them on death marches and it certainly did not force the women into sex slavery. In this is coming from a guy who actually admired a German general by the name of Rommel, who also knows the common German soldiers were not ideologically the same as the nazi's at the end of the day they were on their side in died defending them.

Also because the Germans were the aggressors, they invaded Poland, started militarization which all led to the eventual crushing of germany. Their crimes and horrors they inflicted on the russians in stalingrad paid back ten fold when the soviets came to take berlin. You want to know why Germans do not celebrate these men? it's simple because they like Hitler were the architect of their misery, if you want to know why a German mother does not celebrate her brave forefather soldiers ask her about the post fall of Berlin soviet rape sprees and killings. 


 









 So originally saw this movie on netflix and fell in love, it my was the first time i had ever seen a asian epic movie without flying people or mystical warriors. So i've been kind of dissapointed that their does not seem to be any info on the other films coming out in english or any information regarding us releases.  




 Indeed. LONG LIVE ZIONISM. 




 So the title for the new total war game  based on warhammer has really been annoying me. I mean come on total war: warhammer it's the most unimaginative and uncreative name for a game, even metal gear revengeance at-least had some type of thought process behind it. I think TOTAL WAAAGH or TOTAL WAAAGHAMMER would be much better, the core fanbase would of course recognize it and newer players would be more interested in this title then something called total war: warhammer the rehammering 




 Nah they have a new algorithm. It automatically has avoid rock slingers and terrorist features built in. It also comes with gps coordinate feature so you can email the idf to send in the airstrike if you take a wrong turn in need a immediate shock in awe on some "peaceful" demonstration by terrorist.  




 "Wow. You literally don't know what you're talking about.
this all falls down to the same claim that to the rate of which college age women will be raped
Are we still talking about how many rapes aren't reported? No we're talking about how you get the estimates you're claiming.  Because this is so far from the truth it's astounding. The FBI/Department of Justice has routinely estimated the number of unreported rapes in the USA every year. Here is a report which estimates that 65% of rapes/sexual assaults went unreported from 2006-2010." where's the report then?"

"This is wholly different from the 1-in-5 figure, which does not come from a 1980s study. Did you actually read a word of what you just linked me? Because in the very opening paragraph it talks about it coming from a 2007 study, and the chief warning from the researchers is that their study was too narrow, only focusing on two schools, and so shouldn't be used as a broad strokes thing." Sorry i was referring to this. http://brown-spectator.com/2013/04/lies-damn-lies-and-rape-statistics/ which cited the original 1 in 5 stat. 

"Because of that, a new study sought to get new data with over 1000 respondents across 500+ schools nationwide, and guess what they found? One in five women and one in twenty men in college said they'd been sexually assaulted or raped." Which study is this? http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail iid=593 the bureau of justice statistics says it's 1 in 40 and has significantly decreased and college men were more likely to be raped then women.
"This almost never happens. Intoxication would be someone who can no longer consent because they're very drunk/high, not just having a beer or two. Deception would be either pretending to be someone else in a dark room, lying about using contraception when you weren't, or the like." Wow a guy lying to a girl to have sex never happens are you this dense.  So if both persons are drunk or the guy is drunk is the female a rapist for having sex with him? lying about contraception? really?

"Anywhere from between 1 in 12 to 1 in 20 of the "average kid" will be a rapist someday, actually. And it's about creating an environment in which people are educated and aware and can help stop it. If you're a frat boy and one of your fraternity brothers says that there's a girl passed out in the other room with a wink-wink-nudge-nudge, you can say "whoa dude leave her alone that shit's not cool." Will it eliminate rape entirely? No, not at all. But it will reduce it - as we have SEEN." Seriously where are you getting these numbers from? i want actual sources.
Then what does that have to do with the rape culture which is usually in reference to america's college campuses.
Rape culture extends beyond the campuses.

It really doesn't it's in reference to the belief that their is a perceived boys will be boys attitude that obstructs rape victims from getting justice and that their is a pervasive system in place that does not support the victims of sexual assault. At-least that's what it was originally in reference to.  




 You're really trying to backtrack, this all falls down to the same claim that to the rate of which college age women will be raped, i believe it was 1 out of 5? i looked up the study and the only source for it went to a study from 1980's yet it's often repeated, even president obama cited it back in 2010. http://time.com/3633903/campus-rape-1-in-5-sexual-assault-setting-record-straight/ 

They based it on the same studies you're citing, honestly i'm not arguing with you i'm just waiting for you to actually stop repeating the same crap i always hear and present factual information. They all use the same anon self report census and the sample sizes if you can call them that are based on individual locales which are not representative of a nation wide epidemic or rape culture. But you can't say that, because it's not helpful when we still have politicians who actually believe a woman can "shut that shit down" so i agree with the scare mongers media campaign for the purpose of awareness but when we use this in a attempt to negatively effect or blame a society at large then it's more then a media buzz word it's an ethical issue. 

Define deception and intoxication? girl gets drunk, her friend says he loves her, next morning they wake up, he says i'm sorry Lindsay i just said i loved you so you would sleep with me. She feeling regret over the situation yells rape. In there you go, you see how that works out? in don't tell me you have never heard a sjw talk about regret being a valid reason to claim rape. 

Sorry let me define it in small words. Telling kids not to rape does not work because the average kid is not a rapist, telling a little girl the average boy will rape her is not factual yet it's being proposed as a viable method.

Then what does that have to do with the rape culture which is usually in reference to america's college campuses.  




 No offense but your post reeks of the same sectarian bullshit, alawites dehumanize sunni's blah blah what you forget is that if the sunni's were in power they would do the same if not worse to the alawites.  




 Better then yours when you claim something and then post a link that contradicts your own statement. Did you not even read that story? there is no other 68, that's the issue. There are not a hundred rapes reported, you just said in your last comment it was all theoretical. No what you're doing is trying to do is redefine rape, educating kids on rape does not correlate to actual rape because it's not in relation to sex or average population figures. Rape is about dominance and control, not sexual violence.

You can't find any numbers yet you just stated around 88 women went to jail for false accusations of rape. Do you just state things out of the blue? 




 Wow good on the uk. Now lets bring this to the rape culture of america. Um it stated clearly in the story if you bothered to read it which i guess you did not, that she was arrested and jailed for falsely reporting a robbery and for the robbery itself which is a huge miscarriage of justice but like i said shoddy police work. Now can you cite this 89 number? i would love to see to it and why america has not done it yet.

Rainn great org, http://time.com/30545/its-time-to-end-rape-culture-hysteria/ nice to see even they are tired of the rape hysteria. Yeah that's what i was waiting for the hyperbole line, you do know what theoretical means right? it has no practical application. In other-words your only 10% line is bullshit, you're claiming a stat which literally has no basis in reality. That's the height of bullshit claims.   

No wonder we can't actually fight rape when the advocates fighting for it are using such fanciful claims and misleading statistics. Rape culture= if you don't want to get raped, do not wear revealing clothing, such stupid logic. If we don't want men to rape, tell your boys not rape women. #facepalm

 




 "But we are allowed to prosecute them. People are prosecuted for false accusations. Not many, because the burden of proof is very, very high to avoid something like the Sara Reedy case."

Alright please link to me a case where someone was falsely accused of rape and the accuser went to jail.

"She was arrested and charged with falsely reporting a crime. This is a fact." I read the story, posted exactly what it actually stated and it said nothing of the sort. You said she was arrested for a false accusation, it clearly stated she was arrested for false reporting not an accusation. Am i insane or something? when did it say she was arrested for false accusation against a rapist??? it says clearly false reporting and robbery.  False reporting is a crime, false accusation which is the entire point i was making is not, are you ignoring this?

"We are basing these numbers on studies of our legal system. The most stringent analyses we have suggest that 2-8% of reports are false. The most recent, Lisak, came in at around 5% - right in the middle of that range. Coincidentally, that's roughly the same rate at which other types of crimes are falsely reported, too.
The 2-8% figure comes up time and again. Study after study.
Of course, even 5% means that with tens of thousands of reports per year, we'll get miscarriages of justice like Brian Banks. But a handful of high profile cases is in no way an epidemic."

So.... explain this to me like i'm 5. Where does the statistic only 10% of rapes are prosecuted? 




 Oh had no idea bruh, thought you were being a right asshole mate, my bad. Did not know i was asking for that, i didn't want people to make a build for me but this is my first time so i made a post over at buildapcforme tho since it seems simpler. Thanks for that, i thought this subreddit would be able to help guide me so i don't just randomly buy parts and other things. But i clicked on the sidebar and i'm going through it, once i have a better view of what i want to build and parts could i post a thread here with that defined build in get some tips to fine tune it? 




 **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

Gaming mainly strategy games like rome total war 2, shogun total war, mount and blade, but also hoping to play fallout 4, witcher 3 and chivalry. 

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

700 dollars is my maximum



**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 


Around july 14. 

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

Tower, i was thinking of buying rebuilt and maybe just replacing parts but depending on the best build i will buy a tower case also. OS matters little unless it effects gaming, won't the best monitor i can find but not going to blow my budget on it, a decent monitor for a decent price even used will do. 
**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

Illinois/united states.

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

Starting from the bottom, no reused parts except if i find a really good cheap monitor on ebay or amazon.

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* Replace this text with answer.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

Depending on rather or not a game requires a large memory, cpu or w;e then parts relating to that will be paramount to my build. 

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

Nope this is a basic pc build, but if it does not mess with my budget having a nice custom full tower would be a good finish for my first pc build. 

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

Windows 8.1

**Extra info or particulars:**

 




 Well like i said i'm new here, thought this would be a good place to get a helpful start and i prefer to actually talk to posters instead of going through sidebars and helpful guides, which is why i came to reddit, if i wanted the 1,2,3 of how to build a pc i would just gone to youtube.  




 Nope consoles also.  




 I am. The game is the only new ip that blew me away. The forums are blowing up.  




 In the case i cited under any definition, it was malicious yet it was still not prosecuted. How do you accidentally accuse the wrong man of rape? most rapes like murder are not due to strangers but close personal acquaintances. You're really reaching, of course, but they cannot be innocent until proven guilty if we are not allowed to even prosecute them.

"Following further inquiries, Reedy was arrested for theft and false reporting and, pregnant with her first child (by her now ex-husband), thrown in jail. She was subsequently released on bail, but lost her job. More than a year after attacking Reedy, the man struck again, but this time he was caught and confessed to the earlier crime." wtf i read the story and that's not how it went down at all. She was jailed by a idiot detective who did not believe her story of being forced to give head at gun point to a guy who robbed her gas station which by all accounts is kind of hard to believe at the outset, i mean what kind of idiot would put their penis in somebodies mouth they're threatening to kill. But yeah crap police work, she was not jailed for falsely accusing any man tho she was jailed because they thought she had stolen the money. 

Either-way your comparison falls flat because that was not a false accusation being prosecuted and then later being proven true. So only a quarter of rape's with actual evidence lead to actual arrest strange. So it takes actual evidence for people to go to jail? that seems like b.s and needs to be stopped right now. 

Tell that to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Banks_(American_football) unless you have facts to back up such statements we're going into hyperbole. How can you state only 10% of rape reports and then say they're not false, how do you know if they're false or not, if only 10% are being brought to court then maybe it's because only 10% are actually valid. What are we even basing these numbers on?
 




 Convicted. Look up the data for minorities convicted of crimes and giving harsher punishment and whites convicted for the same crime while receiving more lenient punishment.  




 Bro whites have a bigger population of course more whites end up getting shot, that's not the point, out of all those cases how many of them were unarmed and were they currently commiting any crime that justified the use of deadly force? did you see the homeless white guy who got shot in california or arizona? he got plenty of attention and the cops were charged with murder. Allot of this has to do with rather or not the shooting gains traction in national news, we can't be pissed if we have not heard about it.

That's not how it goes at all, just because black people are more likely to be involved or commit murder does not relate to instances where they were not committing a crime at all, if anything the fact that black people are being killed in instances where no crimes are committed is much rarer yet it seems to be occurring very frequently which is an alarming trend. 




 Wtf is up with you guys always trying to define everything as non racist. Nobody is claiming white people are hunting down black people but there are cops who happen to be white in the majority of cases shooting unarmed black civilians, pointing towards inner city crime statistics in saying oh look more black people killing black then cops killing black people obviously the problem is not that law enforcement is shooting unarmed civilians it's that black are killing eachother. It has nothing to do with what black people are concerned about or why we're mad, it's the equivalent to citing the rate at which jewish husbands murder their wives and then using it to excuse the holocaust. Just because a crime occurs that involves both groups of people does not mean they're related or have any significance in the other case. 




 In how many guns and drugs do they have exactly? 




 Wow black people being killed in high rates and the first thing i see is racist jumping in awesome. 




 Rachel dolezal for the last 37 years has pretended to be black, artificially darkening her skin, wearing black hairstyles(styles frequently worn or originating from African american communities or popularized by black people) she has also been investigated for false claims of ethnic/racial discrimination, filing police reports stating that her branch of NAACP(which she is the president of) had received hate mail, it was later found out by police investigators only two groups of  people have access to the mail box in question, the postal workers who were ruled out and the box owner who happens to be Rachel dolezal here's a video of a reporter who led the unmasking of miss dolezal, she had also attempted to apply for city jobs and positions citing her ethnic background as "black" and her parents have claimed she is claiming her younger adopted siblings who are African american are her biological children https://twitter.com/deray/status/609179032006041601
