 I wrote a paper on zebra stripes for my intro evolution course last year.  It was difficult to find studies on zebra stripes because everyone has just gone with the explanation someone came up with in ~~1890~~ 1867.

EDIT: Looked up the date - it was 1867, not 1890. 




 I'm an undergrad and do research in an ecology lab on my university's campus.  In my ecology courses, I learned about Optimal Foraging Theory (OFT) and even did some small experiments in those courses pertaining to OFT.  In my lab the other day, some of the professors were talking during our weekly lab meeting about behavior and one said that ecologists haven't used OFT to explain behavior in decades, ehoch surprised me since most of my courses devote so much time on the topic.  The professors in my lab are always busy and are out of the lab half the time, so I figured I'd ask other ecologically inclined people here!

Are there major flaws that make OFT a bad explanation for behavior?  




 Here are a [couple](http://www.care2.com/causes/wind-farms-and-eagle-deaths-the-dilemmas-of-green-energy.html) of [articles](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-impact-wind-farms-get-pass-eagle-deaths) about what /u/DonnieS1 is talking about.

I know that wind farms kill far fewer birds than other forms of energy production, but they should be held accountable if they commit the same federal offenses as the other guys.  If they aren't made to pay the fines though, I'd like to see wind farms that kill birds put money towards conservation of affected bird species (if they don't already do that). 




 I just got a friend request about 20 minutes ago from someone I didn't know, but whose name I had seen before but couldn't remember where. When I read your comment,  it dawned on me, and sure enough, this person's name appeared on my phone's caller ID when he tried to call me last week (I don't answer for names I don't recognize). That's really unnerving... 




 Taylor Swift's reaction looks eerily similar to [this](http://i.imgur.com/NMNqH.gif). 




 These headphones definitely make the vast majority of the songs I listen to sound glorious, but I've never listened to any other headphones so I can't say whether or not they're the best out there.  I would recommend them based on my experience and general stinginess though, at least until (or if) I come across another kind that I think sound better and are in the same price range. 




 I got myself the Audio Technica ATH-M50 a few months ago for about $100.  This is my first non-earbud listening apparatus and I'd definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a decent pair of headphones at a fair price, especially since I've spent $150 for Bose earbuds before.

 Dr. Ingrid Visser has [permission](http://www.orcaresearch.org/index.php/marine-mammals-regulations) to participate in these interactions according to the website of the research trust she [founded] (http://www.orcaresearch.org/index.php/research/our-team).  She's written an [autobiography] (http://www.amazon.com/Ingrid-N.-Visser/e/B003BWZFFO) and there's a BBC [documentary] (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0147dw3) about her research style, if you're interested!  Also, here's a BBC [interview] (https://soundcloud.com/orca-research-trust/bbc-swimming-with-whales) about what it is like to swim with killer whales, the New Zealand population of killer whales in general, and Dr. Visser's feelings concerning cetacean captivity. 




 Mmmhmm. 




 Last year, as I was walking down a campus street in the afternoon, a middle-aged couple approached me.  The man began to tell me this story about how his lady has been in the university hospital, so they needed money because their car was parked in the hospital garage and was also out of gas and they haven't eaten all day and needed food.  The lady even showed me a "hospital ID bracelet" she was wearing to prove she had just left the hospital.  I knew this story was BS, because they were in the academic core of the university which is about 10 blocks from the hospital and they both looked homeless.  I told them I was a broke college student, but they wouldn't take that for an answer.  The man kept adding to his story and was getting closer to me and the woman started to move to my side and was heading behind me.  Since there were 2 of them and 1 of me and the street was unusually deserted at the time, I gave them the change in my pocket and they immediately left.  I figured it was better to give them ~$1 in change and get out of there than to stay and potentially get robbed.

 What was it? 




 Are there any particularly fun/unique experiences you've had with your dog? 









 There was speculation among anti-captivity circles that this application had much greater implications for the import of wild-caught cetaceans to the U.S.  Had it been approved, some believed that it could open the door for the capture of Alaskan killer whales that ventured into Russian waters, which would be of great interest to SeaWorld in particular, as the genetic variation within their captive population is deplorably low. 









 Are these rubber-tipped sticks?  If they're not and the guy has decent chops he could probably do some damage to the treadmill. 




 Here are the links to the papers on [blue whales](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1765/20130657) and [beaked whales](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/9/4/20130223), respectively, sited by the article.

I'm surprised the authors of the beaked whale paper were able to get published with a sample size of two individuals, but since beaked whales are so rare, it was probably not feasible to use a larger sample size. 









 Congrats on the long term relationship! 

I've never met anyone from Ohio that is happy to be from here.  Either they already left and are glad they did or are planning to leave after whatever life milestone comes next (graduation, retirement, etc.).  The only problem is that it's like a miniature black hole of terrible that's nearly impossible to escape from. 




 I'm surprised Ohio hasn't shown up yet.  Do non-Ohioans not hate our state as much as we do?

We don't even have a real flag, we use bodies of water as directions (north is called "towards the lake" and south is called "towards the river"), and our unit for measuring time is "days until the next Ohio State University football game."  Oh yeah, and soybeans.  Soybeans.  Everywhere. 




 I was an idiot today and was playing with a power strip with a wet hand while the other was in an aquarium and I was standing in a pool of water.  I felt a buzz in my finger when I turned on the strip that I hadn't felt before when using it and realized I'd just been shocked.  That freaked me out because I could have potentially died and not even realized it. 




 I wrote the previous comment at work and guessed on the date.  In his 1867 book *Mimicry, and Other Protective Resemblances Among Animals* (and later, his 1879 paper published in *Science*), Alfred Russel Wallace suggested stripes evolved in order to provide camouflage from predators by allowing zebras to blend in with the surrounding area.
This particular hypothesis was refuted by Darwin and others since the stripes do not blend with the usual zebra habitat of short grasses, but the more recent adaptation is that the stripes confuse predators by making it difficult to single out an individual in the group.  However, zebras tend to live in small groups or are solitary, so this might not even be the case.

Some other hypotheses are that the stripes are for social benefits (sexual selection or communication), thermoregulation, and protection from parasites (tsetse flies in particular).  Darwin thought it might be for intrasexual selection and described an experiment in which a female zebra and a male wild ass are placed together and the female zebra would only let the wild ass mate with her when the researchers painted stripes him.

Personally, I think zebra stripes are least likely to be for predator avoidance, but that seems to be the one that has stuck in society's list of animal myths.
