 Shame and thanks for the confirmation. Ill just have to back up a bunch of the music, even the ones I have not fully decided whether I "like" them currently or not. 




 What happened with Ozzwald and his/her youtube channel and all the associated music/remixes they made? I could not find any information other than that they are all gone.

Its a real shame at least to me because I really appreciated their Gypsy Bard remix but all I can find is a speedycake and one poor quality upload such as this. http://youtu.be/v4rNysM51kA 

sidenote: I have his original song still and I was trying to tag it with a link to his youtube upload. 
























 Thank you for the link. That should come in handy! 




 Thank you for such a thorough list! I was in a hurry when taking pictures and the tools were everywhere, so it was kind of chaotic and I appreciate you taking the time to go through them like that! 




  **Thank you for all the responses, that should be all that is needed for now. I really appreciate it.**
 

So I am in kind of a predicament where I need to sort a lot of tools in 7 days before the house I am in is being put up for sale and potentially everything in it thrown away if not removed at that time.

   My great grandpa was alive from the 1920s up until the 1990s.
A lot of this stuff I have found I know what they are. But I need to prioritize what is actually of value for keepsakes and what is not.

 I will be going back down later today to snap a few more pictures of items I missed. I would appreciate any kind of help I could get.

If you see a specific type of tool or item in the pile please circle it or identify in someway I can understand since I do not know most of what these are called.
