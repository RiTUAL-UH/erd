 I live in a Canadian town along the St Lawrence river.  I moved here with my parents when I was in my early twenties (ya, still living at home, pathetic I know) and until I learned to navigate this retirement community with little to no activity for young people, being along the river was pretty much all I thought this town had going for it.  I have spent long hours walking and biking by that river, getting into some very secluded areas.  Im pretty burly for a girl and sharp enough to be able to just talk myself out of most problems, so during the day I feel safe in a lot of different situations.  And maybe I shouldnt.  

At the time of this encounter I was not even in that secluded of a spot.  I was sitting by a stream in a wooded area of a public park.  Nice day, and there was a bit of walking traffic.  A college class from the school nearby even came down to the stream where I was sitting to get some water samples and catch fish, by the looks of their instruments.  The teacher (prof, whatever) seemed increasingly alarmed as he led his class down to the water.  I gave a head nod like hey hows it going, dont worry, just sitting here watching the water.  Still, he hurried his pupils to another spot along the water looking horrified but I just thought whatever.

Hearing a rustle in the bushes right beside me, I became aware of what the prof had seen and why he was horrified.  I also realised the head nod Id given him made it look like I was in on this, but I honestly had been oblivious.  In the bushes next to me was a woman, which was confusing because she was clearly playing with her penis.  Had breasts, was presenting as a woman but was clearly a man.  She looked over at me, then down at her erection, and in my stupor of disbelief she had time to actually point to it, like look!  

As I noped out, I actually said nope! and started climbing up the hill to the path.  He (?) jumped out of the bushes, still playing with himself and trying to get hard in a hurry.  His face was really focused as he came at me and I was really glad it was me in this situation and not some tiny matchstick girl because looks dont scare me and I give as good as I get.  Like, Ive been in scuffles.  This guy was especially puny, but you really never know whos got a knife or blood diseases or just how nuts someone might be, so I was just rathering not and hurried up the hill.  

I guess I could have screamed something at him and in retrospect it really weirds me out how quiet the scene was.  I guess we were both just focused.  As luck would have it, the students and teacher were still close by.  Its funny, I didnt call for help or think to walk up to them for help (which is too bad, because maybe we could have caught the guy), I thought to walk through them to dislodge this creepy predator.  Which I did, and it worked.  I then thought I really should keep looking back as I head to the police station and report because no effing way am I leading this guy to my house if he is following.  Still, my number one priority was getting the hell away.

I reported the flashing, gave a statement and all.  The officer asked if Id seen a backpack around when the guy was in the bushes.  At the time I said no but looking back, there was a ton of rope in a coil and some other things that Im not really sure of.  I guess the makings of a rape kit.  There was a possibility this guy had been following me and knew when Id be by the water, which I find unlikely because my routine is incredibly random and I dont even know when Ill be by the water.  The officer guaranteed me this guy would do something like this again and hopefully theyd get him before he really got serious.  Makes me wish Id tried to beat the shit out of him as an early deterrent.    

So, fledgling rapist, lets not meet again.      
 





























 i don't really know how else to put it, (s)he was a gender bender. 




 me too!  it was a real shock and trying to make sense of what i was seeing took a minute.  i must have done three or four double-takes before it sank in!
