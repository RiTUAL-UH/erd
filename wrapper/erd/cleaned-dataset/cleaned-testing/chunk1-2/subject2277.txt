Suspended cops get no extra pay.  Just base salary.
 




 If there's no money in the government coffers, there's no pension.

How could you **not** know that? 




 Do you take any solace knowing his corruption was investigated, Prosecuted and he was fired by his own police forces internal affairs?

They did the right thing, It's the law in Ontario that suspended officers retain their pay. 




 Metal poles are deadly weapons.

 




 Old people are terrified.

Middle aged are scared.

Young people want to party in the Street. 




 Guards were likely paid not to notice. 

It's how things operate in Mexico. 




 Very often when you make a bad loan, you can collect by seizing real property, garnish wages or accept a negotiated new payment plan.

You don't necessarily have to walk away empty handed.  Neither does Germany.

Pay what you owe.  Problem solved. 




 What you call pushing insane terms, I call pushing realistic terms. 




 No love for that genre, but that video was hilarious.   




 You find the results online, it was studied...by this man.  Get a hint of what's in the dust if you read the story.

"Your" dust isn't a rare specimen that likely won't deviate greatly from the mean. 




 I can't even imagine the crazy that /r/conspiracy will come up with. 




 You can still carry concealed.

By your silly argument, every business in Canada is regularly shot up by armed bandits, what with our strict gun control laws and all. 




 You can't just fire all the union members.

You can shut your business down though.

 




 It's not a community garden.

It's a privately owned garden on the city owned easement. 




 Hmm, seems like you could have asked him. 





























 From the story, OPS is the 3rd most understaffed in the entire country.

Those 130 accommodated cops don't help. 




 No.

You must reside in Ontario. 




 From the story;

10% of the OPS is on light duties;

"That senior officer told CFRA there are **130 officers** who cannot do their regular tasks because of things like injury or pregnancy.

"That's 10 per cent of all our sworn staff," the senior officer told CFRA. "That's huge."

I'm told morale is horrible in the OPS, undoubtedly 10% of a force getting out of regular jobs doesn't help. 




 'Outside Canada


We no longer process Canadian Police Certificates for persons living outside of Canada. Please refer to theRCMPfor this service.'

From the Ops website on the background check FAQ

 




 The fact that this even went to trial is a travesty.

The police and the Crown clearly have too much time on their hands.

This man's life is in shambles. 




 Go to the bank in person, see a teller and you'll be able to withdraw some cash. 




 Free speech isn't free if we self censor out of fear of violent reprisal. 




 There are no laws governing abortion in Canada...where I live.

Medical guidelines yes, laws no. 




 People cheering on those who would make Death threats in response to provocative and robust speech should hold their heads in shame.

 




 A fetus alone in the womb will become a baby.

Semen alone will **never** become a baby. 




 Semen needs to fertilize an egg.

Semen can never become a human on its own.

I've honestly never heard someone comparing semen to a fetus before.


I'm pro-choice, but your analogy isn't convincing. 




 I'm prochoice, but the **rare** late term abortions where the baby **would** survive outside the womb, I find quite distressing 

 




 Start.ca

Im perfectly happy with them and I have a VoIP phone with them as well. 




 TIL factual recounting of real events constitutes an attack. 




 Won't make a difference to any claim. 




 I'm happy to see that the police investigated themselves, prosecuted him internally under the PSA, convicted him and then fired him, which was upheld by the OCPC. ( Remember these cases when Canadians claim cops can't investigate themselves)

There **should** be a mechanism in place to suspend officers without pay on a case by case basis.

No such mechanism exists, so dirty and corrupt cops get their top base salary of 90K while they work their way through the system.

So, the government needs to legislate this power, that is currently unavailable to police Chiefs.

The Ontario Association of Chiefs want the ability to suspend with pay on a case by case basis.
