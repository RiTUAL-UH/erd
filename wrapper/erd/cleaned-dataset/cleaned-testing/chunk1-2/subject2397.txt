 Yeah I'll have to check that out 




 I'll have to find some to try 




 I have them all downloaded on my laptop. I watch the Christmas one every year 




 Idk I've noticed a paradigm shift in which the top comments are always "the nice things" to say 




 IPA's are my favorite type. Elysian is my fav brewery so really anything by them.

Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is always a good go to though 




 Pretty much any Stone is a good time 




 I love that episode so much. Makes me want to give Hermes a hug 




 I've submitted a few now and gotten a couple interviews. It feels a lot better once you get an invite but now I'm all anxious about the actual interview 




 Grab the pitchforks! 




 It's lines from a very famous song 




 I eat my skittle's out of a bowl with a spoon 




 Why this deserves to be in /r/pics:

Good action shot complete with blurr lines

Ornate wood floors and stairs

Segue to discuss dog social behavior

Or ya know, put it on facebook 




 Is there any real point to having a dildo that's 2 feet long? 




 I know budgets can be tight but you'd think between now and 1970 they'd upgrade the phone and calculator 




 Lately I've come to realize that beer is actually the only thing that has kept me sane in college 




 I see OP is taking full advantage of the new Nudity rules 




 Are a combo of Bloodflood pt. 1 and Fitzpleasure? I just listened to it for the first time and thought that was awesome 




 Owen libary is my favorite. 6th floor has a great view and usually empty, and the downstairs has the best computers.  Basement of Holland Terrell is also great. or if you like some distraction the first floor of  the CUB is pretty nice 




 This may sound weird but how old are you? I really can't tell 









 You should have that little dog to the right blow up in some Michael Bay esque way 




 Dammit now I don't know what to believe. How do I know lions even exist?? 




 People complain about that? That's like most of Jim's job at the office 




 It's the cheerleader effect 




 "Oh my gawwwd" 




 I think there's another Pink Floyd song where at the beginning you can hear the Beatles playing, and it's because they were in the same recording studio.  




 /r/thatpeelingfeeling 




 Well the lack of anything substantial in this picture would suggest /r/pics, and the content would suggest /r/mildlyinfuriating, but since this is so incredibly not funny it's gotta be /r/funny 




 Wow yeah you know my life so well from one exaggerated post I made earlier 




 Not sure where you live but most places internships/volunteer opportunities are scarce

I guess Im in the minority here. I need to volunteer at pharmacies and theres only like 2 with dozens of other people goin for it as well 




 At least 3 nights a week my roomates and I bust these 2 games out and play for hours 




 I know right? Like whats next cigarettes? 




 I believe this is "standing up". People who stand up don't actually stand all the way up 




 I would partake in the meet up 




 I love the season's tree one. 




 Your smothering me! 




 Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike  




 I always think that too but of course you can wear jeans with other outfits and what not so it's not like $200 for one day's clothing. The perspective is still scary though 




 And Mr. 99999946121081009472 said math never did anything for anyone.. 




 Going to college in the middle of nowhere has its benefits 




 I like the original one posted the best. It has the best "huge" quality too it, my eyes had to scroll up to realize what all I was seeing 




 Apparently the Torpedo is more than just an extra IPA 




 Anyone interested in chatting on kik? Message me your username. I like science, running, video games, tv shows like Seinfeld, stuff like that. 




 Elysian pumpkin beer though. So good 




 Super soakers were the best back in the day. My neighbor had a full arsenal 




 Thanks, now I can study for anatomy here at home! 




 I will judge the swim wear contest. Maybe the talent part too but I'm pretty busy 




 It also wasn't 2014 




 /r/funny has really outdone itself today with reposts. This is 4th top rated thing today 




 This is how I take all my shots now 




 He could not get out of there fast enough 




 Are all those bones named? Are there any lizard anatomists on reddit? 




 I'll take 5 standard packages 




 /r/shit

I'm just assuming... 




 Glad someone spoke up here. I don't really enjoy dubstep but Skrillex has a good sound and was always fun to dance to 




 My cat is actually pretty good at capturing flies but he can't seem to kill them 




 What has everyone been listening to this week? 

I personally have been listening to Woodkid I think his tracks are awesome and has a great voice. 




 Why would there be a doorbell on a chemical plant to begin with? 




 That has been my thought. That was a huge parking lot. Not only that but it is right in front of Scott coman, like they can't even walk outside now type thing 









 Mustache man in the back wants it 




 "I traded it in for  a microphone"

"Yeah I can see that" 




 I'm not the biggest football expert but.. I'm afraid this is a little too true. I think momentum is important for us and Nevada is a school we should be able to beat. Of course if the WSU team that played Rutgers played Nevada I think we would've won. I do however think our home game schedule will be to our advantage since they're against some tough teams but home field advantage will be in our favor. Go Cougs! 




 Not just landfills but the middle of the Pacific Ocean 




 I'm rewatching the show and I just finished Season 7. Over the seasons I think he is one of the most diverse characters  and although it doesn't always make sense I love that he switches persona's each season especially after he gets back from corporate. 




 Don't tell Ayn Rand 




 That's awesome! Now if only the buses were even a little bit on time 



















 I've seen the show too many times so I tend to get seasons mixed up but I'd say for most the show Marshal is a corporate lawyer which according to the show/real life makes a lot of money. Plus Lily has a teacher's salary albeit not great but still. So why are they always seemingly broke? Even if Lily spent her entire paychecks on clothes I don't see how they'd be tight on money, and Marshal's school debt would be bad but I doubt he doesn't have a plan on it. Any thoughts?

 What would cause every stock to simultaneously "crash"? 





























 I got a tent last summer and haven't been able to use it and don't have a car. I'm wondering if there's any secret spots in Pullman that you could set up a tent for the night without anyone noticing. Anyone know of spots? 














 Could be school work, yard work, boat building anything 







































 Learn anything new? 














 These things can't even breath without being loud 









 I know we have spy satellites and what not up there so why can't we just track the plane with one? 









 If a post is bad then it will not get to the top. If something is funny and hasn't been posted then why not post it? 









 I'll always go to beer personally, too much good flavor 



















 What was facebook like when it was limited to college students? 
























 I see a redditor. How many days til someone leaves and how many people leave? 




 Oh you mean that girl over there showing half her ass? Yeah she's just with friends 




 My cat's name is Miles davis cuz I love jazz 









 what.... I almost don't believe that 




 Just because he doesn't remember the conversation doesn't mean it didnt happen. We need answers man! 




 Blond hair 




 Oh right ok. At the moment I'm nervous about a lot of stuff ha 




 What year in med school are you? I'm hopefully going to pharmacy school next year. Just waitin on that email to come 




 I just hate how throughout the series we're led to believe that the whole gang is always together. Uncle barney and Aunt Robin are always prevalent. But no turns out they all pretty much go their separate ways.

Barney's part too. He just becomes a total loser at the end. Perfect month? I'm sorry but no. And then he has a kid with a random ho whom we know nothing about and everything is fine and dandy. Why have we never heard about this kid before. Wouldn't that kid be Ted's kid's friend? Total shortcut in writing 




 I thought the way it was written was classic himym, definitely not the top 5 worst episodes 




 Anything autism related. I don't even know why that gets discussed on Reddit 




 You may need to explain this further 









 Since when is all of france the size of NYC? 




 That's how I got here. I remember back in 8th grade I had a Coach Z shirt. So awesome 




 I have an actual cat, is that cool? Anyone? 




 That's true but at least Barney doesn't introduce the girls to them. I mean I don't break up with someone then show off the latest person I'm seeing to my ex 




 Ok, thank you for actually coming up with a reason. Of course I wouldn't discriminate against other races. I don't think there's a country in the world where every single person is unattractive  




 Are you trying to make me sad? 




 /r/subredditsarehashbrowns 




 I don't get your logic why is it necessary to be attracted to every single Asian group? I mean if you think Italian girls are hot does that mean you have to love Polish girls too just because they're all European? 




 My parents are putting me through college and I thank them all the time. I mean it literally wouldn't be possible otherwise. Working full time at the same time as college wouldn't be enough, and that would be darn near impossible anyways 




 As a college student I can say there's a direct correlation between time spent studying and grades on tests. However I don't really get hw I just have to memorize tons of stuff 




 How is thinking chinese girls are cute racist? And no one asked you to reply to my post 




 Salmobrolas cousin 




 I think it's stupid in most cases. Like at a bar when they pour a beer and hand it to me. I mean really what effort didd that take?

Now for a barber I'm all for it cuz they could totally ruin your life. 




 Peppermint Schnapps. No bueno for drinking games 




 Mandarin and Spanish for usefulness.

Russian and German for fun 




 3. 2 white girls and a chinese girl. I'm 22 now and a guy. I'm white but I seem to be really attracted to Chinese girls for some reason  




 Nyan cat 




 Sports. Skipping class to go on a bus ride for cross country was the best 




 Good thing I'm lipid soluble 




 "Look is this gonna happen or what?" 









 The last episode just really made me bitter towards Robin. I feel like she was the reason the divorce happened. Sounded like she only cared about her career and never spent time with Barney 




 I asked this too awhile back. General consensus was that was just Barney joking 




 And now you're into human sandwhiches 20 years later? 




 Very center of my College's football field. I'll never watch a game the same way now.. 




 Ahh yes, the 500 point turn 




 [Delicious new GIFV format](http://imgur.com/AEUVRrG) 




 I always wanted Ted or Barney (either one really) to marry Wendy the Waitress. She's one of the best looking girls on the show and looks fun. Maybe I just want to marry her :( 




 This may sound weird but I've always thought smoking in old movies or like this picture looked cool. I don't smoke but damn OP's dad just makes it look awesome. Just that relaxed look 




 Hello Dr. Fielder, What is the flu season going to look like this year in response to the Ebola craze right now?  Will people be overly diagnosed?  




 Half of them are of hot girls

Pic I took from the top looking down as he described. Very terrifying!  




 I thought the name of the dog was the best part 




 I toook History of Jazz. Also awesome 




 And is now stalking OP  




 Did she have to be naked for this? 




 I had this as a kid. So amazing 




 $15 of.... in store credit 




 If you think about it most of the crime in those places isn't even reported in the news. So more than likely they're worse 




 You gotta love crab 




 Well I'm glad someone did 




 It's pronounced thermometer 




 Yes in fact these 2 motions are analogous to said fingerbanging 




 Did anything cool happen or did you just mail them back? 




 I can just hear those ribs cracking 




 Chucks/vansheels. always 




 My cross country team was an absolute joke. We did far worse stuff than wave, like skipping across the finish line. It was fun though 




 Yep, had this happen to me once. The dude came to my car, opened my door, and yelled at me.  To OP, that is a horrible situation and I hope the guy gets thrown in jail for a good long while 




 Chad's bad 




 I definitely agree. Although I did love Archer Vice. Glad it's goin back to the original format tho 




 I thought it went well. They were pretty casual and only asked about 5 or so questions that were all what I'm sure any pre-pharm person would have answers to.  Then they let me ask questions; I had a notebook of them written down so I just asked away. And they were all super nice 




 Did everyone back then just have thick black hair with perfect hairlines? 




 MC Escher that's actuallly a genius title for this. I'm still confused.. 




 Plus the timeline seems all screwed up. I watched Death Note in like 36 hours and I couldn't believe the plot of the sho was over the span of like 6 years 




 All mine was accurate except math. It went from 73 to like a 63. I was not happy 




 Thanks for the advice everyone. If anyone else has questions about the interview process I could probably answer them after today 




 This dude I work with said he only ate ramen for a whole month. He said he didn't go to the bathroom once the whole time and by the end his gums were bleeding. He's pretty sure he got scurvy 




 This gave me call of duty war flashbacks 




 Pirate skulls were so 1600's 




 Then get rid of the parking ticket I got 




 My collar is baby blue not purple you jerks 




 Drinking coffee now

Straight black cuz creams for bitches

And teas for snitches 




 But microbio  bio 









 Why can't he write it? 




 This would be awesome framed 




 I can't believe I even finished Face/Off 




 It's been awhile since a good Reddit safe heist.

*prepares popcorn* 




 I need that song in my life. Anyone? 




 Why does KISS look the way they do yet sound the way they do? 




 Seriously, I've asked a few questions that have gotten like 20 replies with only a couple upvotes. Only to be buried with the rest of them 




 For some they actually paid attention and learned a thing or two and enjoyed going to class 




 Watch all the cartoons my parents wouldn't let me watch. All those missed Pokemon episodes.. 














 Don't worry you'll be caught up on everything that's happened in the last years within a week or two 




 That is terrifying. I think it's the eyes. And the antlers obviously 




 I love how the buildings are so huge but scattered about enough to not just see one gigantic block 




 I'm in a college town and my friend has met up with a lot of girls from it. Some are cool, some aren't, either way an easy way to meet up though 




 I feel the same way about North Face. At this point tons of people wear the jackets just for fashion, yet NF still makes the jackets for their intended purpose 




 This is an ideology I can get behind 




 From what I heard he also sold thousands of dollars of diamonds though 




 Yes. 




 I'll have the matzoball soup 









 How could I change my channel? 




 I'd love to wear a button up and tie on occasion. I feel like I'd look weird though 




 Sorry you have had bad professors. 

I myself am a Senior here at WSU and have mostly taken classes in the Bio/chem departments. I have to say with the exception of my Engl 101 TA every professor I've had has been great. They are all experts in their fields, have been very good with explanations and keeping the class interested, and all their tests have been fair in accordance with the syllabus. Even the difficult classes I wouldn't complain about because they just require more studying.

If you are thinking of coming here, please do.  This is an awesome college with great programs (especially engineering).  Go Cougs! 




 Funny you should mention that. I just failed my first Immunology exam, and I too would agree it's been my hardest class to date 




 Rough wasn't it? Feels great to take that last chemistry class though 




 Could be high school, college, grad school etc. 




 I live where it gets sub freezing for the whole winter. Got one of those 3 in 1 Northface ski jackets and it's one of my best investments. Totally worth it if you plan on using one for years 









 How are there 2 of these comments with the exact same replies with different upvotes?? What is this sorcery? 




 It's awesome but looks so out of place 




 Have 5 infants grow up in a room with nothing but 5 instruments, have them learn the instruments but with no outside music knowledge, and see what they play
