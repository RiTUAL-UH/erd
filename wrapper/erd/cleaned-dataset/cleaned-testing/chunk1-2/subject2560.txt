 Never been able to decide between Vancouver and Toronto. I've visited both from the UK and they seem great.  




 It's not that bad. I mean it's expensive but if you're sharing you'll find somewhere you can afford. Some things in London are really expensive - mainly rent, transport and drinking - but there's so much to do for free. Most museums are free, all the theatres do cheap tickets, there's loads of cheap excellent restaurants, loads of parks, and the whole city is like a bunch of towns, each area has its own character. It takes a while to get used to but pretty much everyone gets hooked on London.  




 If I'm having a bad day I just [have a look at this](http://i.imgur.com/rtN6m.gif) and I'm immediately happier. 









 I'm not sure the focus of the study was particularly useful. Equating scientific literacy with just being able to recite scientific results seems both a little patronising and naive. Someone scientifically 'literate' might not know what role CO2 plays in climate change but might be familiar with the experimental processes that led to knowledge about CO2 and therefore be more willing to trust what scientists say.

tl;dr - How scientifically literate can you be if you know the information about climate change but don't believe it? 




 There's a whole heap of ways that stem cells can be coaxed into turning (or not turning) into different types of cells. This study found that slight modifications can stop them turning into fat cells which could potentially be used to fight obesity - bit.ly/1EN16lm 

(Full disclosure: I work at the university that did this study) 
























 Researchers at QMUL have successfully created electricity-generating solar-cells with chemicals found in the shells of shrimps and other crustaceans for the first time. 



















 If your client doesn't currently have any profile and you don't know the outlets you're trying out reach. I'd suggest targeting one or two developing the story specifically for them and pitching over the phone. As other people have said journalists get hundreds of releases a day and if they don't recognise who a release is from they'll probably not even open it unless the headline suggests it's huge news. If you get picked up in one place and send a release to others it stands a much better chance of the story being repeated elsewhere.  




 I'm pretty sure you don't have to eat them or otherwise ingest them so we should be ok.
