 Unfortunately, he is the inexperienced one in our relationship...he is not taking advantage lol. 




 It isn't just about a threesome! It's about the whole situation, the threesome Was one example. Obviously I'm not asking for advice on how to say no to a threesome,.I'm asking how to maintain such a dominant relationship! p.s. please don't patronise me due to my age! 




 I want to make him happy without making myself unhappy...I don't want a threesome, and he does. I want a negotiable solution. 




 We've been together for 6 months, nearly 7 and he is the most dominant man I've ever met. I find this hard, because I'm extremely opinionated and won't back down without a debate...it causes issues to say the least.

 He likes to be dominant in the bedroom, which I'm fine with but now is slightly pushing too much at the idea of having a threesome. It's feeling a little to pressuring and I'm not sure what to do. How to I give him what he wants, without degrading myself or ruining the relationship. Also, how do I maintain a relationship with a guy who is obsessed with threesomes!!!



   
**tl;dr**: How do I make my guy see that I'm not going to back down to his every need? He is too dominant and I'm not submissive enough.  




 She only has a single bed, whereas I have a king size. Literally the only reason 




 I'm not lol! I'm Italian heritage... 




 I stay out every weekend at my boyfriends house, and whilst I do my sibling uses my bed as her shag pad...and then I sleep in the filth without knowing. 

What are your opinions on how to stop this, or how to make it known known that it is not ok!!!!! 
























 I always struggled with not being able to touch myself! It did get worse with a full bladder, and also if I read anything or watched anything was sexual content. The ache would be there, unless I completely forgot about it by doing something else. I'd take photos of myself to please my OH and make him aroused. 

Also, cumming without touching is a very tricky skill that needs to mastered!

Good luck! 




 Elastic bands tied around the nipple for a short time, careful not to leave on for too long due to blood circulation.

Nipple suckers, try getting some suction cups and then play with them when suctioned, should be ultra sensitive. 

or if you are my adventurous, buy a milking machine and have your partner milk them! ;)  




 My partner (23 M) and I (18 F) have been together for 6 months, I am experienced with BDSM and have been for a long time, unfortunately the bdsm I experienced was mixed with abuse and so this does cause problems with kinks..My partner would like to experience things such as threesomes and having someone watch us, however I have bad experience with both of these and so am not so into trying them again. I feel by saying no, I am taking away his kink and I feel guilty for doing so. Does anyone have any advice for overcoming fears caused by bad experiences?

Thanks.  




 If you have nothing nice to say, please leave! I think the set looked lovely.  




 I didn't think there were many VS shops in UK either! 




 UK ladies, where do you buy your lingerie from? 




 Thank you, finally someone realises what I'm asking lol. :)
