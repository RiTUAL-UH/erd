 I am trying to submit Youtube videos of some of my favorite songs that I think others might enjoy. When I click "submit" it throws up an exception in red text  under the that says "that reddit only allows text posts" I don't understand. The sub is filled with Youtube videos, and I thought music videos were the preferred posts there.  


































 She left her ID near the MoneyGram Kiosk, and found it lying there later. As she was leaving she overheard the woman who was standing behind her in line telling the lady at the desk the same reference number and name. She had already received her money, so I don't think this person could have profited from this. Why would she do that? 
















































































































































 What do I say to my family and friends? How do I reach out to my friends? I have suffered from depression most of my life. Is there any advice or words that can help me?  




















































































 I  understand that they're just trying to create a buzz for their product, but I've been in the market for a new interface and honestly wanted to see what they had to offer. Now I'll just find something else. http://www.arturia.com/audiointerface 














 It was all tongue-in-groove with no studs. 
























 So they won't shit during parades. 




 Ed and Bob had just landed the biggest sale in their firm's history. Ed knew he had to hurry home to his pushy wife Mary, but Bob persuaded him to have a drink or two at a nearby tavern. Being a lightweight, Ed vomited all over his shirt and tie after only a few. 

"Aww man, Mary is going to kill me Bob. You know she doesn't want me drinking or hanging out in bars." 

Bob, feeling overly confident about their recent victory was sure he had the solution. "Don't you worry about her.  Just put this crisp twenty in your shirt pocket. When she sees the vomit tell her that someone else puked on you, and gave you the twenty to pay for the cleaning." They continued to drink until the Tavern closed and each took their own cab home. 

When Ed arrived, Mary was waiting, furious at the hour, and his obvious state of drunkenness. 

"Where have you been!" Ed was already unbuttoning his shirt. "You're drunk... and covered in vomit! What is wrong with you? I should have listened to my mother you worthless sack of... "

"Now hold on one minute, woman!" Ed drunkenly interrupted while Mary tore through and examined his things. "I can explain that vomit! It wasn't me! A guy down at the Tavern threw up all over my shirt. Look in my shirt pocket, there's a  twenty dollar bill. He was honorable enough to pay for the cleaning." He was already crawling into bed, and pulling the covers over himself. "You see, I'm not always the bad guy." 

Mary held up two twenty dollar bills. " Ed, there was $40 in your pocket." 

Ed lifted up from his pillow, squinted one eye, and tried to focus on her. "Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you. He shit my pants too." 


Apologies for submitting from a mobile device. 




 The CS2X caught my attention on eBay. I read some reviews and it sounds like an underrated instrument that can be extremely useful. Anyone play and/or have one? 




 I understand this wasn't a very popular virtual/sampler synthesizer. I can understand some of the gripes I've come across on forums. Support being discontinued being the biggest. But, I am impressed by some of the sounds this thing can produce. I like that it can be programmed and then disconnected from the computer. I was wondering if anyone had any advice with programming the thing. I've spent a few hours with it, and I'm amazed by the number of parameters and controls the thing has. The multi function seems really powerful. Does anyone have any experience with uploading patterns? I've noodled around with many of the presets, but still haven't found a clear path toward making my own patches from scratch. Is that possible? Any other general advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. 




 I would like the sequencer on the Microbrute to sync up with the Venom. I have both MIDI cables amd USB. I would prefer to be able to sync them without using a DAW as I would like to jam free of the computer. I understand how to use MIDI to control one device with another, but I'm not getting anywhere with sending a clock signal between two. Can anyone help me with this? 









 I have a Arturia Laboratory, a Microbrute, and a Boss Dr-550mkII. Two interfaces , Berhinger Q502USB and a an old Tascam US-122L. Tascam has an in/out so I've been playing with it. I have plenty of cables. I am trying to sync these devices without using the USB connection on the Microbrute. If I use more than one USB connection for audio, the noise becomes unbearable. I want to use these devices separately without one ever controlling the other. Just sync. The Laboratory has a Midi in/out. The Microbrute and Boss have an input only. Is there any way that I can make this happen? 




 I am going to keep this as short as possible. Whenever I have my computer plugged into my mixer via USB, I get a loud, high pitched buzz.  It went away the other night, and came back tonight.  I tried isolating every appliance and florescent bulb in the house with no effect. I'm wondering if a failing HDD could cause this? Maybe the power supply fan? I really enjoyed combining my analog gear with my soft synth. Now the frequencies of both are affected. This noise is driving me nuts!

edit: first I tried lifting the ground on the PC, but that only helped when I used my best cable. (I have several music USB cables) I realize that the cables were in the inductive field of my stereo.  Moved the stereo box and everything went away. Sweet silence. I then reapplied the ground to protect my machines and house. Sorry if I wasted anyone's time. I feel like this has been a useful thread. I learned more than a couple of things. Thanks to everyone who commented. Y'all helped me get into critical thinking mode. I don't get enough of it. Thanks again.  
























 Let me first say I'm open to any input as long as it is budget oriented.

I recently acquired an Arturia MicroBrute, and I naturally would like to expand the capabilities of the instrument with some simple effects (and later some complicated stereo effects). I was looking at Zoom effects first because of the value of their entry level line (and the seemingly ancient Reznor endorsement). 

My question mostly involves the frequency processing of bass and guitar effects. I know there is a distinct difference between these instruments. How confined are these pedals to these frequency profiles? I am a bassist by nature (bass guitarist), but I intend on using the full range of the MicroBrute through looping and sampling. I just don't have much money.

I can shoot some sexy pics of the MicroBrute and my Laboratory 49 if necessary. 


































 Today I have seen DHS, FBI, state rides,  and an inordinate amount of local police. I realize it's probably just something local, but it's been all day and night. 




























































































































 I'm not too concerned with definitions here. Just want to learn of some new titles. Here are a few of mine in no particular order. Pink Flamingos, OldBoy, Pontypool, Synecdoche, New York, The Poughkeepsie Tapes, [half of the titles in this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_considered_the_worst),  




















































































 Watching The Daily Show's interviews of people at the convention highlights to me, just how ignorant we are of the other party, respectively. Do you think that the situation we are in is the product of the people? 
















































































































































 I see plenty of cases where a user has reposted a link in a different subreddit, and gets plenty of upvotes from it. Is that OK? I was chewed out for posting an article when another article has been posted on the **same story** in either the same or a different sub. Is that OK? I've seen some redditors who post their links in several subs at the same time. Is that OK? There is a bot that reposts everything from /r/news, /r/worldnews, /r/politics, into a separate subreddit, /r/POLITIC . That user will get infinite karma from that bot. Is that OK? I've read the FAQ and I still don't have a clear Idea of what is acceptable and what isn't. Is there a general consensus on this topic? Because there seems to be a lot of experts out there.  
Edit: spelling and formatting 




 Is it not common knowledge that more than 90% of the veteran's walking around are not active duty or retired and therefore do not currently hold a military ID of any kind? I'm posting this because my university sent out an email inviting everyone to a special football game. The email explained that veteran's and active military get in free with an active ID. Only people who are active, retired, or disabled get an ID. In fact not all disabled have an ID. All of these offers just end up being a slap in the face. Have you ever tried to convince someone at a business or institution that you're really a vet? It's disgraceful!  







































 I feel the film deserves a solid seven. Why are these sites so down on comedy and horror? It's not like there are no watchable horror movies.
