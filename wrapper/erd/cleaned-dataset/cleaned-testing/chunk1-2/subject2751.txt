 Great week for me!

Games I've played for the first time:

**Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective**: We played case #1 and we all had a good time. Truly an unique experience, highly recommend if you enjoy detective stories.

**Myrmes**: Solid worker placement game. I heard it could be brutal but nobody played aggressively in my game. The slight concern for me is the replayability of the game.

**Istanbul**: Love the efficiency aspect of the game. As a light (around 1 hour) strategy game it is probably one of the best out there. Could easily see expansions coming out.

**Blood bowl: Team Manager the Card Game**: Not really my type of game as it was quite confrontational but everyone did seem to enjoy it.

Games that I've played before: **Machi Koro**, **Caverna**, **Terra Mystica**, **Castles of Burgundy**, **Fresco** 




 This list is probably what you are looking for: Rahdo's top 10 worker placement games.

These are basically non-standard worker placement games. 

For example: 

In **Euphoria**, it takes an entire turn to retrieve your workers. However, places are never fully blocked, when you go into a space with someone else's worker, you bump them off and so they retrieve that worker back for free.

In **Keyflower**, workers act as a currency to bid for new buildings.

In **Fresco**, you assign your workers simultaneously and then reveal. Therefore you have to guess or double-guess where other people want to go.

I would recommend **Manhattan Project** as well, where you could put all your workers in buildings you have bought in one go, and also you could access other people's buildings by using the espionage action. 




 A mediocre week for me.

Games I have played for the first time:

**Biblios**: I liked the card drafting and push your luck elements a lot. Instantly became my favourite filler.

**Battlestar Galactica**: I understood its charm but it did not click with me. Indecisive players and constant rules clarification (it was a seven player game with 3 newbies, and we played with expansions) led to a 5 hour drag. I think once is enough for me.

**Discworld: Ankh-morpork**: Decent fast-playing game. I liked the asymmetric victory conditions.

**Bling bling gemstone**: Ridiculously stupid sounding game which was actually fun after a few drinks.

Games that I've played before:

**Caverna**, **Manhattan project**, **Russian Railroads**,**Lords of waterdeep x2**, **Kakerlaken poker** 




 Good week for me:

New games played this week (in order of enjoyability):

**Lewis   Clark** - love the efficiency building mechanic where more resource is not necessarily a good thing.

**Glory to Rome** - another efficiency building mechanic where you want to save number of actions and leech on others.

**Guildhall** - sweet short game based on chain reactions.

**Drum Roll** - standard worker placement game. The problem I had was that the cubes were not very thematic and some cards were basically rubbish.

**Packet Row** - good filler with slight deduction element.

**Port Royal** - Good filler where you can purchase cards to hedge the randomness.

**Roborally** - very chaotic, too random for my taste. Probably more fun if played slightly drunk.

**Cheaty mages** - another filler full of randomness.

**Holmes 13** - guess-who style deduction game. Not really much substance to it.

Games that I've played before:

**Agricola**, **Alhambra**, **Ingenious**, **Lords of Waterdeep**, **Splendor** 




 A good week for me.

New games I tried:

**Suburbia**: loved it. Lots of strategic planning, with a moderate degree of interaction so it's exactly my type of game. I love how we all create some back story for describing each of our cities as we go along.

**Cosmic Encounter**: Was somewhat fun but a bit too confrontational and chaotic for me.

**Arctic Scavenger**: Nice deck builder with some theme and interaction. Would like to play with the role cards next time.

**One Night Ultimate Werewolf**: I normally stay away from party games but this is short enough for me to be able to enjoy it.

**In the Year of the Dragon**: Another Feld that I enjoy. Probably the most unforgiving game of his but I really liked the mechanics.

**La Citta**: Was pleasantly surprised by this city building game. Early actions are hugely important.

Games that I've played before:

**Loot**, **Agricola**, **Tzolkin**, **Alhambra**, **Coloretto**, **Quantum**,**For Sale**,**Tsuro**,**Mascarade** 




 I like it a lot and would love to see a computer version come out!

I particular like the skill upgrade aspect which is basically efficiency management. I also like the strategic but not too confrontational blocking of routes which also boils down to managing efficiency.

The drawback I think is that the map and scoring conditions are fixed. This means each game feels somewhat similar at the beginning and at the end. Perhaps introducing different vp scoring bonus conditions would allow for more variety between each play. 




 Not too remarkable week for me:

First time played 

**Robinson Crusoe** - probably highlight of the week. 4 of us played scenario 2 and were so close to winning but the snow hit us hard. We lost on the final round.

**Machi Koro** - nice short dice game. I find the red cards a bit overpowered.

**City Council** - the semi-coop element didn't work out, would never play again.

**Ingenious** - neat little abstract game.

**River dragons** - a short programming game that is mildly fun. 

Played before

**Trajan**, **Libertalia**, **Hansa Teutonica**, **Alien Frontiers**, **Power Grid** 




 1st time played:

**Brass**, **Sail to India**, **Incan Gold**, **Ra the dice game**, **Panic on Wall Street!**, **After Pablo**, **Skull   Roses**, **Ascension**

Games I've played before

**Agricola**, **Notre Dame**, **Terra Mystica**, **Russian Railroads**, **Steam**, **Concordia**, **Manhattan Project**

Highlight was definitely learning how to play Brass! Such a well designed game, would love to try again. 




 In Concordia, you basically draft your own victory point scoring conditions. I think it's quite neat as it 

a) enhances your own strategy as cards provide you with both actions and scores;

b) hides everyone's true vp. Someone could appear to be doing really well on the board but score-wise they might not be; and

c) enables you to block others scoring points by buying the card they want  




 Short games: Splendor, Battle Wizards, King of Tokyo, Fleet, Jungle Ascent

Main games: Trajan, Snowdonia, Hansa Teutonica, Zombicide, Lords of Waterdeep

Only tried 3 new games this week: Snowdonia, Hansa Teutonica and Zombicide. I liked HT a lot but am doubtful whether it gets samey as strategies among players appeared to be quite similar. 




 Fillers: Coloretto, Bang the Dice Game, A Fistful of Penguins, Gang of Four, 7 Wonders, Archaeology

Main Games (played before): Terra Mystica, Tzolkin, Russian Railroads, Pandemic, Lords of Waterdeep

Main Games (first time): Trajan, Euphoria, A Study in Emerald

Loved Trajan so much that I immediately bought it after playing it the first time! I enjoyed Euphoria but somehow it wasn't enough for me to cross the line from a good to great game.   




 I'm a new gamer (~2 months)  but already highly addicted to boardgames and I've played 6 days last week to try find games that I like. It was tiring but well worth it:

*Loved it*

**Terra Mystica** My third time playing it. I bought the game and this was my first time teaching newbies. Enjoyed the game playing the dwarves. Hoping to try the mermaids/swarmlings/alchemists next time.

**Lords of Waterdeep with expansion** Played original game once. This was the first time with expansions. With 6 players it was still very good but I think it would be more enjoyable with 5.

**Russian Railroads** Loved it! I diversified too much and ended with 275 points. Will definitely replay, even consider buying it.

**Tzolkin** x2. Played this many times already. Still loving it.

*Liked it*

**Pandemic** I like how easy to learn the game is and how everyone gets tense during the game. 

**Nations** Played with 3 players. Went for military strategy and was very tight on resources. Will play again.

**Eclipse** My first long game (lasted 6 hours with 6 players). It does give you a great sense of achievement. Just didn't enjoy it at times when it took too long between turns. Not a big fan of war/dice rolling as well.

**Agricola** Learning game, got 22 points. I like the mechanics of the game but it felt a bit too restrictive to me. I enjoyed Caverna more.

**Ra** I quite like the design of this clever bidding game. Would replay.

*Alright*

**Coup, Quantum, Modern Art the card game, String Railway, Marrakech, Serenissima**

Hopefully I could game 4 days this week. Already looking forward to trying exciting new ones! 




 Does anyone know where I could find this in London? Their official website doesn't ship to the UK. Thanks. 




 Thanks! I'm not sure how to get the sizing correct as I've heard many people say it stretches a lot and it needs to be downsized 2-3 inches. So if I go to a retail store the "correct size" wouldn't feel comfortable right? How could I tell if I found the correct pair?

 When watching a live performance (e.g. concert/play/musical), I often think of what would happen if my mind is suddenly swapped with the performer. I would think of how much I'd panic as I don't know their material, and how the performance would stop as the audience jeers.
I have hypothetical stage fright. 





























 It was a good week!

New games played:

**Mage Knight**: Bought this second hand at a bargain and played the tutorial (exploring) game solo. Already now that I'll love it.

**Five Tribes**: Solid game. I find it more tactical/opportunistic than strategic. Just don't play with players with AP.

**Lost Valley**: Tile laying Euro with a badly written rule book. Turns are quite simple so a game was quick. We all felt that this game was just a bit short of being a fantastic game.

**Via Appia**: Fun light game which reminds us of arcade games.

**Valley of the Kings**: Great deckbuilding game with set collection for a small box. I plan to buy this one.

**Glen More**: Fun little tile laying + resource management Euro. Really liked the turn order mechanic. I'll buy this if I have the chance as well.

Games that I've played before: **Ingenious**,**Lords of Waterdeep**, **Agricola**, **Port Royal**. **Star Realms**, **Fresco**, **Dominant Species**, **Greed**, **Biblios** 









 I find that the best way to form a strategy is by looking at the monuments before the 1st turn begins. Decide on building a specific one, with a backup plan on building another one in case someone else built it before you.

Then based on the target monument, you probably have to upgrade your tech tree to fulfil your strategy more efficiently. The first half of the game is probably spent gathering wood/upgrading tech/gathering corn etc just to survive and build up for your long term plans.  




 I agree with the samey feel. Players can practically plan out their strategy before starting a game. Sure you would tweak your worker placements opportunistically, but you would be able to stick to a predetermined strategy more or less. 




 Sounds promising! Hopefully I don't have to throw away most of my games when I move. 




 I'll be moving back to HK in 2015 so thank you for the info.

Do you know any places/forums to meet random hobbyist for games? I'm just afraid there won't be opportunities for me to play Euros/try new games anymore. 




 I'm on the opposite end of the spectrum...
Just started playing board games this year, have played 200 different games already but currently own only 10 (though I'm constantly resisting my urge to buy more) 




 **Martin Wallace** - If you like managing money and cashflows, you'll love his games: London, Brass, Steam.

Also games that are slightly chaotic: A Study in Emerald, Discworld.

Heard good things about A Few Acres of Snow but have not personally tried yet. 




 I played over 20+ new games in August so I'll just list my favourites:

**Ora et Labora**: I love resource management games and this is very enjoyable as there is not much stress of feeding your workers. The only downside is there is no setup variability so I am not sure about replayability.

**Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective**: If you play with the right crowd, this is immensely satisfying.

**Bruges**: This should be in the top 100! Although there are lots of interesting decisions to be made it plays quite quickly.

**Ground Floor**: There are some interesting mechanics and as a pure Euro I still find it quite thematic.

**Thunder Alley**: Looks complicated but actually isn't. Fast paced racing game.

**Star Realms**: Probably the best filler that I have bought. It's good with 2, and decent with 3.

**Dungeon of Mandom**: As a filler this ticks all my boxes. Easy to teach, slightly strategic, fits in a tiny box, and fun!

**Space Alert**:  This has to be my favaourite co-op game. There's practically no downtime, no quarterback issues, and you really feel that you win (or lose) as a whole team. Love the subtle humour as well (Did anyone wiggle the mouse?) 




 This should help you a bit:

I personally quite like boardgameguru.co.uk 




 Just tried **Impulse** yesterday. I like it quite a lot, especially how quick it plays. Not too keen on the battle element, so I'll pass on buying this one but will definitely play it again if it hits the table. 




 Heh, I have ordered it on Amazon last night and the price went up by 9 today! Can't wait for it to arrive next week. 




 Thanks! I'm interested in **Pax Porfiriana** but it seems to be sold out.
**Biblios** is already one of my favourite light games, and I intend to pick up a copy when the reprint is out. 




 Thanks for your suggestions! **Blueprints** is on my watchlist and I just saw that the reprint is available on amazon, I'm tempted to click Buy Now.. 




 I have yet to try this, thanks! 




 I agree with **Splendor**. I know this will lose a bit of its appeal but if I use wooden cubes instead of chips, I could fit the whole game in my pockets! 




 I enjoy euros such as **Terra Mystica** and **Agricola**, but they are difficult for me to transport during the week, therefore I consider them "weekend games". I am hoping to add to my collection some "weeknight games" that are compact (**able to fit at least 2 games in a backpack**) but are still complex enough not to be categorised as a filler. I know that **Glory to Rome** is an obvious choice but it's sold out everywhere..

Thanks in advance!

**Number of Players**: 3-5 players. (the group discourages 2 player games)

**Game Length**: 0.5 - 2 hours

**Complexity of Game**: As complex as possible and as little dice rolling as possible.

**Your Budget**: Not an issue

**Competitive or Cooperative**:Either

**Games I Own/Like or Dislike**: Games that I dislike: hidden roles/bluffing/confrontational (**coup**, **resistance**,**citadels**). Games I own that fit my criteria already: **Guildhall**, **Race for the Galaxy**, **Hanabi**
