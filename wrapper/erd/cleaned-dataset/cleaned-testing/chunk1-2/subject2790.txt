 Was completing a History exam at uni last year. Had finished my first essay question and was taking a little rest before starting the next one.

I looked down and there's a fucking wasp crawling up my top! I had a silent freakout as any noise would have had me kicked out. I swiped the bastard off my top only for it to land on my leg. I then knocked it onto the floor and stomped the shit out of it.

My history tutor happened to walk past at this point and gave me the weirdest look. Really wanted to write an explanation on the exam paper. 




 Jean Grey.  




 "I know what you mean. We'll be all down from early evening so if you decide to pop down I'll see you there, you can give me goss from Blackpool lol"  




 Aged 3/4 I was out at a pub with my family for Sunday lunch. A larger gentleman came in and proceeded to use the fruit machine. His size must have offended me as I immediately turned to my mum and yelled* "MUMMY HE'S FAT!"

My poor mother had to apologise to the man in question and I happily went back to devouring my meal. 




 Vanity Fair - I studied it for my advanced higher dissertation and I struggled to read the book critically as I enjoyed it so much. I still count it as one of my favourites.  




 Philtrum - The space between your nose and lip where it curves. 
























 Some films or TV shows. I remember watching Juno a few years back and crying at the end; I don't even remember why. The worst part was I'd already been laughed at by my mum for crying at the end of Breakfast at Tiffanys (who leaves a cat out in the rain like that?). 




 Community.  




 Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons for the daily reminders now about payment but want to make sure we can all get along to Newcastle in one piece of paper and I have been together just over a year ago. 




 How have I never noticed that?? I really need to hit up IMDB more often.  




 My NSis and NMum do the same. They keep calling FH by his university nickname - he graduated in 2012. He's told them before he'd rather go by his actual name but "That's what he was introduced as so that's what he's getting called."  




 They're the worst, at least bees have a purpose. I actually passed that exam which was amazing considering the panic attack I had following Waspgate.
