 Nothing will keep multipools from mining profitable coins 




 Yup that's a thing 




 They already did at the 1.6 fork/update. It's called digishield and the digibyte guys helped with it. 

The reason multipools are still mining doge is because of the profitability.  




 Sounds like a plan 




 Um hmm 




 I'm a little disappointed. I asked another shibe to post him on his 'roo and he didn't. Now you post without your 'roo. I'm starting to think all my geometry classes and books were wrong about the land down Under
