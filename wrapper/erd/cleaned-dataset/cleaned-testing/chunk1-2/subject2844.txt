 That was confusing 




 Your tramp of an aunt 




 Most people are disgusting creatures who don't wash their hands after touching their junk. Sad, but true. 




 I apologize for all the nice folks in the USA. I've always encouraged my friends to be mean to foreigners. We are still working on it, but hopefully we will have everything in order by the time you visit. Have a lovely day...asshole ;) 




 Shut up Seahawks fan 




 Reddit 




 The Lost pilot is pretty captivating 




 I showed up to my construction site early one day and found this guy that would hang around the site all the time named Vito blowing a guy. Found out later that he got killed in a terrible way. 




 That's a crappy situation 




 Did the Ginger make it? 




 I was at a party in college drinking and having a good time when a few kids came over that were looking for some trouble. We were out on the front lawn asking their group to move onto the next party and stop causing trouble and they were getting more and more riled up. My buddy put his hand onto one of them to ask them to move down the block when another kid suckerpunched my friend and knocked him out. He immediately took off running, as we gave chase, and he started to run across the street. Right as my buddy grabbed the back of his shirt, the kid got plowed into by a car.

It was a grisly scene. The kid was hit so hard that he went through the car window. He was slumped over the steering wheel of the car and the driver was sitting there motionless with a look I will never forget. The kid's leg was backward and his bone was sticking out of his leg. He was unconscious for a while and we called the cops to send an ambulance as quickly as possible. He woke up after a while and started screaming in pain and trying to pull himself out of the windshield. He was cutting his hands up real bad and a few of us had to restrain him from hurting himself any further. 

Several cops, ambulances, and firetrucks showed up and eventually he was removed from the windshield and taken to the hospital. The car was going 32 MPH according to the police after they measured the skid marks from the car's brakes. The dean of student affairs interviewed me a few times about what happened and told me that the kid had numerous broken bones including the compound fracture of his leg, internal bleeding, a major concussion and needed over 400 stitches. My buddy that grabbed his shirt had to get glass removed from his hand and needed several stitches. The good news is that the kid recovered and returned to school after a few months. I will never forget the whole experience, it was such an intense situation. In a flash of time, a kid's life could have ended, but he luckily was spared. We were obviously pissed at the kid for hitting my friend, but I would never wish that on anyone. 

**TL;DR:** A kid suckerpunched my friend, ran into the street and got hit by a car and ended up halfway through a windshield of a car with terrible injuries. 




 Cough....bullshit....cough 




 Can you tell that story again, but in English this time? 




 That's a really shitty situation 




 This sounds like the beginning of an Eli Roth movie

 Chewing tobacco, individual coffee packets and Taco Bell hot sauces.

 I'd save Biggie and Tupac. Have you heard any of the garbage that people like Souljah Boy and Lil Wayne have put out lately? 




 That was a crappy joke 




 And where could we find this porn? 




 Drink and drive, constantly 




 King Joffrey Lannister 




 Kim Kardashian 




 Pissed the bed I put him to sleep in and then blamed me in the morning because I didn't order him, in his blacked-out drunk state, to pee the night before. 




 Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts

Seriously, the best book ever! You all must read it.

 On August 7th, 2007 I happened to be lucky enough to be offered to throw out the first pitch of a San Francisco Giants game, as part of Italian Heritage Night. My family booked the biggest block of group tickets and so the Giants ticket office gave us the opportunity to throw out the first pitch and my family chose me. Barry Bonds ended up breaking Hank Aaron's home run record that night when he hit his 756th home run. I ended up getting him to sign the baseball after the game. The ball has my name, the date and the Giants logo monogrammed on it.  




 What a dingleberry move on your part! 




 Phil....Phil Connors? 




 Zero fucks were given that day 




 My cheeks get flushed and sweaty when I eat green apples. I never really noticed that this was unusual until I was wiping some perspiration off my cheeks and my girlfriend asked me why my face was so red. I told her about it and said that I thought this happened to everyone when they ate tart things. She laughed at me, called me weird and assured me that this was not normal. Am I dying? Is this a actual medical affliction? 





























 Your username leads me to believe this story might not be truthful... 




 Whisky also does the job quite well

 Freedom isn't free 




 They are absolutely incredible! I love their music. Your whole thread made me very happy :) 




 J5 is so dope. I've seen them live several times. They just performed at Outside Lands in San Francisco last year.

 Was it an archeology class by chance?  




 Did your parents not hug you enough growing up? 




 That most of the people in the Reddit community were intelligent, contributing members of society. Some of you should never procreate. This topic has me in stitches...(just to clarify- that means I am laughing uncontrollably haha) 




 I always thought it would be really cool if they rebooted the series with a new Entourage. It could center around a young, upcoming rapper and his entourage. It could have some of the same players (Ari Gold, Billy Walsh, etc) but have a fresh new feeling to it with an all-new cast of characters. I would have loved to see something like that. 




 Maybe a 5 or a 6, I just have seen every episode and picked up on it part of the way through reading your well-written post. Funny stuff. 




 Smoke more weed Turtle 




 KY Jelly 




 Thank God I won't have to hear from this turd burglar anymore. I fucking hate this guy. 




 Godspeed my friend. Happy NYE. I will hit my Roor in your honor! 




 I haven't seen the interviews. I'll check them out!

Was hoping for some juicy stories from high school. 




 Was she a slut? 




 Taking a shower and hearing a loud noise and being worried you will have to engage in mortal combat...butt naked 




 Her eyebrows scare the shit out of me 




 Even before reading this article, I found this ass clown to be one of the most despicable, entitled losers in Hollywood. This just confirms his douchiness for me. Suck it LaDouche.

 The last season of Dexter. Spoiled a show I used to really like.

 A dolphin. No known predators, extremely smart, fast and are one of the only other mammals that have sex for fun. 




 Your son has a fiery temper! 




 Led Zeppelin's "Rock and Roll" was used in a Cadillac commercial and it's just not the same anymore. 




 There would be nothing funny about me seeing those clowns, because I would be sitting in a pile of crap. The poop would definitely be of the nervous variety. 




 Haha I was only kidding. No hard feelings. 




 That is tragic. Sorry for your loss. 




 Sorry for your loss 




 I just threw up in my mouth
