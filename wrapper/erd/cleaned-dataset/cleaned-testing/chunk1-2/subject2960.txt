 This is some excellent advice. My intelligence has made me bitter and jaded, I'm unfortunately a bit of an idealist so when the world doesn't live up to my ideals I become bitter about it. It's something I've really come to terms with, that it is better to be humble and kind than intelligent and cold. I hope it is something that I only get better at as I get older. That being said I really need to work on myself socially as I still see social interaction as a mechanical thing that other people find organic. 




 I have a ridiculously high standard for myself too, perfectionism is something that often leads me to depression. I have similar mechanical thinking when it comes to social interaction. What comes easy to other people, simply talking, small talk I guess, is a painful thing for me. I have to try to perform small talk. I remember being maybe 12, and attempting to analyze the way the "popular kids" spoke to each other so I could maybe mimic it.  I just can't function it seems. 




 Yeah it brought up a lot of problems in my last romantic relationship when I started experiencing depression again. I have it twofold people like me when I have my shallow mask put up, this fake person who likes what everyone else likes and goes with the flow, but as soon as I ever open up and talk about something "deep" with a person they usually remove themselves from my life. So I just expect people to leave now. 




 I should be in my third year, but I've dropped out because of depression. I was undiagnosed until July this year, which is miserable considering how long I've been suffering from it. At least I'm on the road to getting better now. 




 This is exactly my school experience. I was always beaten down for being ahead of my classmates. It was pretty miserable being a ten year old and having no one else around me understand what I was talking about. 




 Yeah, my family moved at very key developmental stages where I lost all my friends and any kind of social circle I may have been building. I'm more of a failed extrovert than a true introvert. My social life is screwed up. 




 Yeah I know how that feels. I mentioned in another comment how I have a numbing existential pain that follows me around no matter how happy or content I am. 




 I like it a lot, it's very underrated. It's all about the characters in the story, not so much the campy scifi that surrounds it. 




 So far all it has caused me is absolute pain. I'd say I'm socially stunted as a result of intelligence, which has lead me to not trust people. I've dropped out of college not due to lack of success, but because I don't trust myself. I would gladly trade my intelligence for happiness. 




 I relate with everything you just mentioned. Even before I was diagnosed with depression I had this subtle knowledge that felt like I wasn't meant to be happy. I really appreciate the quote at the bottom too, thanks. 




 I like Kurt Vonnegut, he has a sad, uplifting, and absurd way of looking at the world and why people do things. I'd recommend Slaughterhouse-Five. Anything by Mark Twain too, especially his short stories and novellas.  




 I've never been tested, though based on my performance I'd guess I'm considered well above average intelligence. I sympathize with what you're saying at the end. I've ruined a lot of close relationships, I'm isolating myself, and I've dropped out of university (not because I was underperforming just because I can't take life anymore.) I feel like I'm either going to beat this and be the person I've always wanted to be, or I lose and kill myself.  




 It's always at the back of my mind, it's like a numbing anxiety that just leads me back to depression. 




 I was like that through highschool, I grew up in a rural town quite literally in the middle of nowhere. All my teachers always thought I was the smartest kid in the school, and I showed it in the last year, came second highest g.p.a. in my grad class. I spent most of my grad year not depressed, so that may have helped. 




 That's very interesting! thanks for sharing. 




 I like a lot of art films. Andrei Tarkovsky, and Wim Wenders are two of my favorites directors. I think there's a lot in their works that speaks to the INFJ mindset. I especially like the movies Stalker, and Wings of Desire. In mainstream films I really like Bladerunner and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind.   




 Recently my therapist brought up the possibility that I may be gifted. I suffered from depression during my childhood and apart from periods where I was too apathetic to care I did excellent in school. I've heard it said that depression is common amongst people with high intelligence. I just wanted to ask amongst this community and get some perspective.  




 Due to some recent circumstances I've started seeking counselling. I've gone to see a psychiatrist and have been diagnosed with depression and some obsessive compulsive tendencies. From what I've read I think I may have BPD.

I'm a 20 year old male. Since I was little I can remember having serious mood swings. I feel very needy when it comes to other people, I'm also very afraid of them leaving me. I've had attacks of anger or crying when someone leaves me or when big plans change at the last minute. I've lied about random things because I feel insecure. Stupid things like going to a certain concert or something like that. During worse parts of my life I've had suicidal ideation and mixed with feelings of abandonment I have almost self harmed. I have threatened suicide, and have a dramatic streak when I feel I can no longer cope. I have had paranoid thoughts about almost anything you can imagine. I drink to self medicate. I always think that people close to me are just looking for an excuse to bail out of my life, and if they do leave I have major panic attacks. There's has been a pattern of people walking out on me so I'm always ready to drop someone else first, this causes problems in my relationships. I always feel a compulsion to impress people that I meet for the first time. I have fairly idealistic or black and white world views and will devalue people who disagree with me. I've been physically violent with people close to me in the past, and sometimes throw things when I'm angry. When I was younger I had a bad habit of acting out in an attempt to get others to accept me. I was bullied a lot from 8-14, partly because I believe I was already depressed at that age.

 




 I can remember from a young age having spells of crying, or on the verge of crying. I can remember having spells of this even up to around the age of 17 or so. I've always just felt overwhelmed by negative emotions at times, and have gotten inappropriately weepy at times. I'm new to my diagnosis so I'm still trying to find out what fits into my description or not. I can say with confidence that I've suffered from depression and anxiety before this most recent spell, but is this not being able to control negative emotions during circumstantial events fall within the realm of my depression? 




 This entirely, it's such a viscous cycle. All I can think about is how I've been weak and failed in the past. How am I supposed to build confidence when I have such an awful track record; then it just feeds into the next bought of depression.  




 Yeah I get that way too. That's when I can take a lot of work load, it's kind of like "buckle down, weather the storm, you should be in a good place when the feeling comes back just do these things in the mean time." Then it doesn't work out and I end up angry and frustrated.
 




 Thanks a lot for the response. I'm not holding any illusions as to continuing this relationship. The thing that bothers me the most about the whole situation is how out of character this was for me. I've never done things like this before and it makes me sick to think that I ever even got angry at her for anything. I'm just trying to get back to who I was before this year with the added experience. I want to be stable longer before I date anyone else let alone her. She does matter a lot to me and if I've lost her for ever than so be it, but I think that things might be better for the both of us if she knows what's happening with me.

P.S. Thanks a lot, it's been really difficult so far, but at the same time it's good to know where those emotions came from in the first place. I've got a long road ahead of me, but I'm taking off time to make sure that I never act like this again. 




 The people who are suggesting counselling are correct, if you have not yet tried counselling than that is a good direction to go. Anger is not a good way to communicate in a relationship and there needs to be healthier ways to go about it. Anger is generally a sign of other issues, it is not okay that he takes this out on you but both of you should seek counselling. If he doesn't seek counselling or seem to make any improvement than you should start thinking of ways to leave. 




 I've been there before, just many years ago now. I'd say this time was a bit different being out on my own though. University can do a number on you. 




 already did, looking for wider feedback.
 




 When I wasn't actively being depressed it would come out as anger in general. I was overly judgemental to a lot of people and was generally dissatisfied with everything around me. 









 I'm a 20 year old male. I've been suffering from major depression for years and only over the past few months have I actually been diagnosed. I've found with my depression I have periods of anxiety that lead to depression, which I eventually push down so I can actually function. So I'm severely depressed at the same time as being able to maintain a fairly substantial work load. That being said I can only focus on my work load anything else is too much. Eventually my depression starts coming out again and the facade that I put up cracks. It usually starts to break down after a few months with angry outbursts, crying randomly and then suicidal ideation until I'm full on depressed again.  

So has anyone else felt this way before. That you can push down your depression for a period of time but it ends up coming out again as anger, anxiety or frustration? 




 Thanks a lot for this. I'm not looking to get her back, I'd be lying if I said that's not what I would like, but I'm not expecting anything and I need to get healthy before I can date anyone again. I just want her to know that I'm sorry and that nothing that happened was her fault. She didn't mention any of this stuff when we broke up, even though I asked. I guess she didn't feel it was needed. Anyway, I'm sure she knows something is up with me, it was pretty obvious looking back, but for me it wasn't at the time. I just don't know how to talk to her about it. I mean calling her up and being like "Hey haven't talked in a while, I've been diagnosed with a mental illness, sorry for all the garbage I put you through" seems a little forward. Thanks for the response. 




 Me and my ex dated for 2.5 years we broke up in april; before we started dating we'd been friends for 3 years I'm 20, she's 21. I didn't take care of myself and I treated her like garbage. She has so many completely valid reasons to never want to speak to me again. I became completely focused on school without any regard to anything else, it was all I could handle. I had what I would call an existential crisis that triggered clinical depression. I went to a counsellor early on when i was feeling a lot of anxiety, they told me I should speak with a philosopher. I wasn't sleeping at night, wasn't eating, was missing showering every other day, and falling asleep in the afternoon or in class. Lost interest in everything I enjoy, was a snob to my friends, and walked around with a chip on my shoulder.
 
I did so many things that were absolutely crazy, and obviously signs that something was seriously wrong with me, but I didn't do anything about it at the time. I became a complete misanthrope, I hated everybody and criticized everyone including her parents. I became dependent on her. In the last few months we ended up fighting a lot and I almost hit her, like raised my hand and said I wanted to, but didn't. I did end up shoving her once. I'm so ashamed about what happened. But wait there's more. I became kind of semi-controlling and I was jealous of one of her guy friends, who I probably was right about but I let how I felt affect me too much. I definitely crossed the line with that too, I just felt like I wasn't good enough at all. I didn't do enough for her birthday and valentine's day. It was just dinner, flowers, and a gift but I felt I should have done more. During all of this I was spending a lot of time playing video games because without realizing it I couldn't deal with my own life.

During a panic attack I had I almost cut myself, I've never done something like that before it was crazy, she stopped me from doing that. I was off handedly mentioning killing myself like an "maybe I should just kill myself then I wouldn't have to deal with" ____ whatever problem I was having. 

After she broke up with me at the end of the school year, I didn't leave my apartment for 2 weeks, I just cried. I couldn't piece things together, I didn't talk to anyone I was just dead. It took me a month to realize how messed up I had been. I've since gone in and had pscyhiatric assessment done. I've been diagnosed with severe major depression. I'm seeing a therapist and am on medication.

I've never been like this before, I've always been a patient, caring and loving person. I was the one who could take the pressure in our relationship, but I lost it. This past year has been so out of character it's difficult to describe. Apparently my friend's and family has been very worried about me but didn't say anything.

Me and my ex haven't been speaking very often since the break up. She wanted to stay friends (for some reason I don't understand) but I told her that we both needed space. She said that she'd be there if I needed anything. I told her I wouldn't. Anyway, now I've dropped out of college for this year while I get my head back together. 

Do you think that I should tell this girl why I acted the way I did? I'm feel so ashamed about what's happened, I have a hard time believing it myself.  She was my best friend for five years and the last 9 months have completely ruined that. 

TL;DR: I've been diagnosed with severe depression. I've acted like a monster for almost a year, my ex left me with good reason. I feel like I should talk to my ex and at least give her an explanation for why I acted the way I did. 
























 When I reach rock bottom with a depressive episode I find that my social boundaries almost completely disappear. I talk to people I wouldn't otherwise talk to about pretty deep, or personal stuff. It's almost as though I just have to dump my negative thoughts on people close to me, to help me carry some of the weight. Most of the time it's alright I have people who I can talk to but I often have a hard time internalizing those horrible emotions when I'm at the lowest of the lows. Do any of you experience this too? 




 yeah I understand that completely, I'm 20 and have been called an old soul so many times I can't count it. I'm not a religious person and don't actually entertain the idea of reincarnation, but I've always identified with the idea of having been around the block a few times.  




 Yeah I did the same thing, it was always trying to push it as far down as possible. I think that by doing so at a young age it actually caused my depression to be worse now. I can remember doing some things in school that were really not alright, and just biting my tongue so I didn't cry sometimes. I've been trying to work very hard at exercising as a way of wasting the energy those negative emotions cause. 

I'm really sorry to hear that you have a problem that makes exercising dangerous. I can't imagine how I'd manage without. 




 Wow that's horrible, I'm sorry to hear it's taking so long. I don't know how I got an appointment so fast. 




 I've become much more empathetic since realizing I was struggling with depression and seeking treatment. Before that though I was about as bitter and jaded as you can possibly get. 




 about a week and a half. 




 Really?, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and an anxiety disorder after my first appointment with my Psychiatrist and I'm from Canada. 




 Thanks a lot for the recommendation. I have to say that now that I know I'm depressed and that I've been seeking treatment I don't feel as cold and jaded as I did before. I know where those negative feelings and coldness was coming from now so I can manage it better. At the same time there is a degree of realism in the way I thought before. For instance most people feign empathy for things happening in other countries, though it is almost impossible for them on a human behavioural level to actually care because they have no invested interest. I guess it's kind of stuff like that that still hangs around in my head, but I've been trying to empathize more as a part of managing my depression. 




 Oh man I understand where you're coming from a lot. I am absolutely polite and helpful to almost everybody, even when I am having a major depressive episode. People have a tendency to take advantage of me this way. I'm very jaded about almost everything though, politics, philosophy, everything. When you read enough, the world becomes horribly small and rather depressing, especially when you read a lot into sociology and philosophy. 

I think that more often than not I'm myself only around strangers, or drunk. Everything else feels like maintenance a lot of the time, I feel like I need to keep a facade to keep friends. 
 




 For me it may have very well have been a lot of anxiety I had as a kid. I can just remember very clearly either saying horribly cynical things, or just crying in class. I got into fights every now and then but I never started them. I just remember being incredibly weepy at times, or over emotional. I didn't cause a lot of trouble, but I did and said some pretty morose stuff at a young age. 




 No it was just about the way I felt about it, that I was pissed off enough about how stupid I felt people were that I felt I had to go talk some sense into the people handing out stickers, instead of ignoring it. Perhaps that wasn't the best example, but I did things like shot people down in class discussions and was just a huge asshole about things. I'm not like that when I'm not in a depressive episode so I was just wondering if other people shared that experience. 




 I relate a lot to this. I'm not out of the woods, but I've definitely been an ass to people close to me. 




 My depression has definitely left me a bitter and less empathetic person than I was before I became depressed. I've become sort of dismissive of most things that other people seem to get very swept up in. I honestly have admitted to myself that I don't have the emotional resources to care about what happens in the rest of the world anymore. I know it's not good that there is war in Syria and drought in Africa, but I just find myself not giving a damn. I actually have started thinking that most peoples empathy for these sort of things is just a big show they put on. 

For example, with the whole Kony 2012 thing, I ripped into that like there was no tomorrow, being bitter and jaded at what seemed like sentimental schlock. It wouldn't usually bother me, I'd ignore it and let it go, but I actually went to the booth some students had set up at my college and basically drilled them to see if they knew what they were talking about, mostly they didn't. 

I don't know, I just feel more bitter, jaded, and down right cynical than ever. Do any of you get the same thing? 




 I've recently been diagnosed with depression and looking back on my personal history I've been depressed since a fairly young age. Probably since I was 9-10. My Psychiatrist and Psychologist both agree that I experienced childhood depression. I can remember being just randomly irritable at times where it wasn't appropriate, or acting out in other ways. I remember just having fits when I was younger that looking back corresponded with periods of anxiety and depression.  




 Yeah we've talked about it quite a bit now, and have decided to talk on a semi regular basis. This was her idea not mine, I've already told her I have no idea why she'd want to speak to me again. So I guess that's good, she's the one who is really pushing to continue at least a friendship. Though I'm not trying to use the depression as an excuse, I think it's fair to say that I only ever behaved in that way while depressed, never before or after. She says that it doesn't bother her and that it's nice that there's some explanation there. 




 Yeah, I went in again to have a visit with the psychiatrist I've been seeing, he was able to better explain what he thought my issues are. I'm still not 100% on it, because I know I've had weird hyper/irritable episodes in the past, but he said most of them seem to be driven by anxiety rather than a mood state. I'm going to keep an eye out for symptoms regardless, and I've been mood charting for the depression that I have been diagnosed with, so I guess time will tell. Thanks for the response. 




 I often feel that humans live very unnaturally, that humans aren't supposed to live in massive groups of hundreds of thousands. I wouldn't say that I'm a primitivist, just that I feel the way things are set up which is for a maximum productivity society hurts the human mind that it influences. Things like television and consumerism, too much information always bombarding you even if you try to avoid it. Humans are built for living in smaller family groups, not giant grids with thousands. I guess that's why living in an apartment building feels like a prison to me. 




 Just that it seemed that these episodes were driven more by anxiety than anything else. I made it clear that I felt the anxiety was more of a symptom than a driver, but he said it seemed the other way. I can't see how an inflated self esteem and grandiose thinking could come from anxiety. In some cases I'd agree with him, not so much in others. 




 Some have an evening, others have lasted about a month. 




 Yeah I make a lot of comments about my intelligence. Yeah, no one suspected that I was depressed, maybe a bit neurotic, but nothing more than that. I built a persona that was the opposite of how I was feeling, I made comments about my looks and intelligence, and was pretty haughty sometimes. It was all just made up to counter the scales. 




 Totally agree. I'd say I come off as very high strung and full of myself, **especially** when meeting new people. I figure that I have to come off as a dominate personality as a confident type personality, but it's all just an act, it hasn't done me any favours. 




 I think we're on the same page, I just took it to a bit of an extreme. I think there's a certain level of depersonalization that goes along with it. I know I just feel like a pit behind the "face" that I put up, and recently I haven't been able to muster the energy to keep it going, and when I could keep it up. When I could keep it up, it would just be the most fake, arrogant, manufactured face you could possibly imagine, as soon as I got home it just disappeared. 




 Yeah that's kind of where I am. I've just spent a year acting kind of like this without really realizing what I was dealing with. 




 I've discovered that I show a fake kind of self confidence in an attempt to hide how horrible I really feel. It's almost as though I'm trying to convince myself I'm someone impressive when I know that I'm really not. It sort of happens more often during periods where I feel horrible about myself. I can convince myself to act self confident even though I'm not. It feels like an equal and opposite reaction to the depression, sort of like well if you feel like crap inside act like you're not outside. Actually it's more in line with the feeling, if you feel horrible inside, devalue everything around you so you feel better. I end up being horribly judgemental and condescending.  




 It's actually terrifying how much like the people in Brave New World a lot of people really are. I'm a horrible idealist who tortures himself with thoughts of "real happiness" or "true beauty." I'm very much starting to believe those things are unattainable and are just fantastic delusions of what's really possible. Off topic, but it does cause me a great deal of strife and unhappiness. I wish I didn't think about these things, I wish I could be content. 




 Actually I brought this movie to my exgirlfriend, saying how amused I was at the concept. That's when I realized I'd become one seriously bitter, angry, misanthrope, and it wasn't 3 months later that I started going to therapy. 

edit: I suppose I should actually reply to your ideas. I've learned not to hate the people who I think are awful and greedy, most of the time they don't know any better. Is it something to lament? yes, is it something I can change? probably not. You see, the world has become a very ugly place, and, I believe, people by and large have also become that way. We live in a world where there are weapons that can destroy whole cities in the blink of an eye. The situation, overall, has become rather bleak, cheap, and ugly, and many people have adapted to reflect this. There are reasons why I find art so lacking in it's ability to provide me comfort or catharsis, it's because there is no group of words, images, or notes that can extinguish the existential anguish that comes from living in our time. A time when everything could be moving toward a hopeful, beautiful future full of peace and promise, but so often falls short of that ideal.  So, while I used to resent those who act horribly or choose to distract themselves and ignore, I now simply lament the state of things.  




 I used to say even worse stuff, I'd off handedly mention killing myself without realizing that saying something like that is inappropriate. I find that trying to keep a positive frame of mind in general has helped, I don't say stuff like that anymore.  




 I'm 20 so I've spent some time in university, but all of my professors knew my name in classes of 50-200. In highschool a lot of my classes like Literature, History and Religion were more or less dialogues between me and the teacher. 




 When I was ten I read the lord of the rings to myself and understood it. I can remember being in grade 6 and reading 1984 by george orwell because I was done all my work. My teacher "made an example of me" and sent me to the principal's office where I then told them I had been sent there for reading in class. I spent the rest of the class happily reading in the comfy chairs at the principal's office. I remember trying to explain the roman senate to a bunch of eleven year olds in a social studies class. 

In my highschool years I basically had free roam to come and go as I pleased because most of the teachers knew it was a waste of time for me to actually attend class. I had a real problem with accidentally talking down to people which obviously didn't gain me any friends. 




 I just don't think that society has the infrastructure to tend to the needs of people with exceptional intelligence. People with higher intellects are usually more emotionally sensitive as well. So when an intelligent child, teenager or young adult experiences the turmoil that comes along with a generally uncaring world they have nothing to truly help or steady them.
