 Nice shot! 




 A zealot hero would be my first choice as a starcraft warrior, but I think there are numerous other possibilities. Ultralisks, roaches, and immortals come immediately to mind. A marauder might also be interesting as a hybrid warrior/assassin. Kind of like Sonya, but instead of getting right into the fray, it'd be more focused on zoning enemies out.

The firebat idea is a cool one, I wouldn't have thought of that. 




 My suggestion is to friend the good/friendly people you play with after the matches. You can build up a really good group very quickly that way. 




 Why does he use such a long knife? Seems like it would be awkward to wield, though he certainly isn't having any difficulties with it. 




 I had no idea you could do this. I hope they bring it back, because I always split Olaf off and control Baelof and Erik together, and frequently wished I could bind the latter two together. 




 His D is rather tenacious. 




 I've experienced this a few times since the patch. It happens infrequently, but it definitely happens, and exactly as you say, as soon as I engage in combat for the first time, the game lags for about 3 seconds. 




  It's basically proven that raving toxic lunatics lose more games, and I'd bet my bottom dollar that the kind of person who would use a mute-all button and that toxic jerk are a lot alike, and I want neither on my team.

You've used the phrase "toxic lunatics". Read your comment history, and tell me, honestly, that you wouldn't call somebody who behaves as you do "toxic". Your last 10 comments are extremely hostile and negative. I stopped counting after that, but I'm guessing that this is pretty much your MO.

I mean this seriously, I really think you should do a self evaluation, because your behavior suggests that you've got some serious anger problems that need to be addressed. 




 I think you meant to respond to the parent of my comment. 




 Patch day is normally the second Tuesday.

According to whom? Just because that's when they usually do it, doesn't mean that it's late if they don't. They never said the patch would be two weeks ago. They said it would be early this week, and it was. You need to adjust your expectations, not to mention your sense of entitlement.

If what you meant is that, then you are thanking them for completing their scheduled B.Net maintenance at the time they promised.

I am thanking them for completing the patch at the time that they promised, because that's something that I want to encourage.

Imagine you're Blizzard, and if, like you, everyone were to complain whether you complete the work late or on time, you've got little motivation to be on time.

Truth be told, my post probably doesn't have any meaningful impact on whether they're late or on time in the future, but they were on time yesterday, I appreciated it, and it only took 30 seconds to say so. So I said so. I wouldn't really call that "hero worship", but if you'd like to, by all means. 




 The only thing worse is accidentally dismounting by hitting the mount key, and it's only worse because there is absolutely no good reason for the dismount key/command. Right clicking the mini-map at least serves a purpose.

But yeah, I agree, accidental mini-map clicking is something they absolutely need to fix. It's definitely gotten me killed more than a few times. 




 You mean almost two weeks late with undocumented changes?

What are you talking about? How are they two weeks late?

They said the patch would be yesterday from 3am to 11am PST. The game was back up no later than 10:55am PST. 




 Am I right that if you're not going to kill the towers that it's best to leave them at 1 or 2 bullets, so they don't recharge after you leave? 




 Gorgeous 




 Actually that was meant as a nerf. Ghost Uther was way to powerful before. 

But they are similar, so yeah, hopefully a change is coming for Tyrael, too.  




 Wow, thanks for pointing that out. I totally didn't make the connection. 




 I so wish this would have included a total rework for Tyrael's practically non-existent trait. Alas.

Tons of great changes, though. Can't wait to try them out! I really hope the performance optimizations are significant. 




 What is this referencing? 




 Worthy cause. 




 Yeah. It's just terrible. It almost never does anything of value. I'd much rather have something that helps me *avoid* dying. 




 Agreed on Tyrael (never played Anub'arak). If they just gave Tyrael a worthwhile trait, preferably something that made him a bit more tanky, he'd be okay. 




 I hate Thrall's. It might be thematic, but he goes from intimidating to... not intimidating. 




 Please this. I so want a true solo queue where all 10 players queued solo. 




 Ah, couldn't find the VODs before. I see them now. Thanks! 




 More taxes on the poor.

If this makes you mad, and it should, consider the impact that all of this hopeless desperation has on crime (spoiler alert: it's not going to go down).

Then take a moment and connect the dots: increasing financial burden on the poor, lowering taxes for the rich, and privatizing everything. Where does that lead you?

In other news, Ted Cruz announced that he's running for president today.

Hmmm.... 




 That sounds great. Do you know if his videos are available somewhere? He's only got one up on YouTube. 




 People using abilities just to use them drive me crazy. I'm looking at you, Gorge Stitches. 




 Seems like it. My game DC'd. 




 Same. Yet to see it. 




 The plants would basically provide better insulation. You'd still save money, but I'm with you. I'd rather be generating electricity. 




 He's a lot of fun, but he needs a different trait. The current one is practically non-existent. He's a tank, so he doesn't die a lot (more often than not I'll end a game with zero deaths), it's super easy to avoid the explosion, and even if it hits, the chances of it having a meaningful impact are pretty low.

I'd much rather him have a trait that will help me avoid dying. Given the fact that he's not the tankiest tank, and doesn't put out very much damage, I think giving him a useful trait would put him closer to balanced. 




 That looks amazing. If I didn't have a strong preference for characters that I really like looking like themselves (such as Tassadar), I would definitely buy this skin.

 What if I told you I wanted to have the right to NOT vote? What if I thought voting legitimatize this violent entity?

Submit a blank ballot.

What if I don't want to endorse either democrats or republicans for executive office?

Vote for somebody else, write somebody in, or leave the ballot blank.

Would I be forced to endorse in candidates I strongly disagree with?

No. 




 I certainly hope so. The Protoss are awesome. I'd be happy with anyone out of the Starcraft or Diablo universes, though. 




 That was what I was most looking forward to, too. Very disappointing.

  Legalization won't stop over-age people giving pot to younger people.

What's your point?

"Drug dealers don't ID," and they won't when it's legal (they will still sell pot to youngsters).

Sure, but there will be a lot less illegal pot, especially as more and more states and countries legalize. You don't see kids buying bathtub gin or black market cigarettes. 




 We ended up using JsonFx, because we needed something that worked with iOS. We found it to be somewhat limited and had to hack our way around a few issues, but it got the job done.

We ended up dropping JSON due to size considerations in the end, though, and went with Protobuf instead. 




 I know, it was a joke. 




 Both pretty lackluster. Are we sure these aren't warrior cards? 




 If you're being vastly outnumbered and I run towards you to heal you so you can escape do not run back into the fight, I cannot keep you up.

I hate this so much, and it transcends support. Countless times I've put myself at risk or pop a valuable CD to buy a doomed teammate a small window of escape, but they read it as "reinforcements have arrived, let's do this thing!" and turn around to re-engage the 3+ enemies chasing them.

The end result is always the same: they die immediately and now I'm in the hopeless situation that they were in.

Thanks guy. Thanks. 




 Yet relatively left, figuratively.  




 Free money for everyone, basically.

Here's a good introduction:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIL_Y9g7Tg0

Check out /r/basicincome for more. 




  If people receive money for no reason, then they will just sit around doing nothing.

If you started getting $1,000 checks each month, guaranteed for life, would you quit your job and do nothing? 




 Basically, you give everyone (without exception) free money (without conditions) every month because:

1. We live in a time where resources are abundant enough that we can easily provide the basic necessities of life (food, shelter, healthcare, etc.) for everyone.
2. Automation and efficiency are crushing jobs left and right, and it's only going to get worse.

 WHY THE HELL IS THERE AN UNMOUNT BUTTON!? IT SERVES ABSOLUTELY NO PURPOSE, AND SOMETIMES I ACCIDENTALLY DISMOUNT FORGETTING OR NOT REALIZING I'M ALREADY MOUNTED. SO INSTEAD OF GOING FASTER, LIKE I INTENDED, I END UP GOING SLOWER!

REMOVE THE POINTLESS DISMOUNT BUTTON OR LET US BIND IT TO A DIFFERENT KEY, BLIZZARD! 




 I'd contact the League of Women Voters in your state. They can probably point you in the right direction. /r/ask_politics is probably also a good resource. You might also contact the show. They research this stuff pretty thoroughly, and seem to like getting people involved, so they might also be able to provide you with some help/ideas.

If you still come up empty, reply here and I'll do a little digging myself.

You might also contact your federal representatives and express your support for statehood for territories. Also, share the video with your friends. Awareness always helps a cause.

Good luck!

 That's clever. Roughly the same effect, but quite a bit more versatile, and thus not entirely dependent on spell power.

I like it! 




 Can't confirm, but I don't see why it wouldn't. 




 And deadly poison :( 




 I meant it's not worth your time to try and take advantage of the system. 




 This results in Mars somehow having even less electricity than it currently does. 




  Little did they understand that they can play the game of using cash when it favours you, and using other payments when it doesn't.

I would argue that you couldn't possibly do this to an effect greater than $1 a month, and your time is worth more than that. Thus, it never favors you. 




 Thanks. Deleted this and the other duplicate. 




 How is Warsong Commander broken? 




 Bad warrior card: Check.

Awaiting amazingly powerful mage card. 




 What? 




 Yeah, I'm sure you're right and the balance will be a lot less one sided over time. I don't need an exact 33% split between the three major franchises, but something a little more balanced would be nice. 




 [Tosh](http://www.styleweekly.com/binary/f593/night15_daniel_tosh.jpg) would be bad ass. 




  I love all blizz universes so im probobly bias :P

Well, I love them all, too. That's why I wish the others had more of a presence in HotS. 




 *More*, sure. I just wish it wasn't *most*. 




 7 Wacraft heroes and 0 Starcraft heroes is believable. 3 Diablo characters is not. 




 Ha, sorry :P. 




 Grats! 




 That sounds sensible. Any suggestions for what to say to steer them politely? 




 Yeah, I think the issue was that I didn't have a background image on my mask, or something like that. 




 Google's RSS reader :( 




 That's cool. I like how it just only uses gravity and the conductivity of the copper. I can't believe how fast it is, nor how perfect the sphere is.

Very neat, very clever. 




 That was awesome. 




 Seriously. What the hell. 




 I'm really excited to see what the next version looks like. If they can slim them down and trim $100 from the price, I think I might be interested. 




 Wow. That channel is a gold mine. I could watch these for hours, and I don't even drink!

Thank you for sharing that. 




 I like it, but it would be better if we could have a "mute frequently muted players" option. If you're a jerk, you get flagged and then people don't have to listen to you, but can still communicate with their positive teammates. After a while, the status wears off, lasting longer the more frequently you end up flagged. 




 What am I looking at? Is this the angularjs.org equivalent of Angular 2.0? 




 Good call. Moving post. 




 Ideally I'd like to see:

* An in-depth preview of and release date for Tomb of the Spider Queen
* 3-4 new heroes announced, hopefully not all Warcraft heroes
* New features, such as spectator mode
* More info on the Diablo map
* Pipe dream: announcement of ranked solo and/or random queue 




 If it was as tight and polished as Hearthstone and had something akin to the arena to hold my interest (and let me build up my collection without financial investment), I'd consider it.

Honestly, I'd probably still be playing Solforge if it was as well done as Hearthstone. I thought that game was super compelling, but the actual user experience was very lacking.

I'd play those other games in addition to, not in place of, Hearthstone, though. Hearthstone is awesome. 




 Lime flies when you're halving fun.

 Your frustrations are certainly understandable. Our electoral system does not promote good candidates. Fortunately, there are a number of easy reforms that could correct (or at least improve) the situation. [Here is one such solution that you might find interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE list=UU2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w), and perhaps even fighting for.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this, and enjoy your first election! 




 Beautiful. Gameplay doesn't look very compelling, but it certainly is gorgeous. 




 Just curious, why did this (rather well thought-out) comment necessitate a throwaway? 




 Oh yeah, love that one. 




 LEDs are pretty cheap now. You can get them for ~$7, they last for decades, and they only use like 6 watts. I get them $3 per bulb from my power company. 




 It's up there with [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YkLPxQp_y0) as best one yet, in my opinion. 




 Good luck with your RL stuff. I hope things go well for you. 




 Aye! 




 Why don't they shoot sequels immediately after, then, to take advantage of those same savings? 




 Dunno. I wouldn't pay it much mind. 




 Definitely a must read. Steuver is an amazing writer. 




 Very pretty. Keep up the good work! 




 Three quick pointers:

1. Don't fight pointlessly, especially in the beginning.
2. Experience is extremely important, don't leave a lane empty unless there's a very good reason.
3. If your team is down a person, avoid a fight. If their team is down a person, pick a fight (or try for an objective/mercs).

Good luck and have fun! 




 Same. 




 this stuff takes time

No, it takes competition. The US pays more for slower and lower quality internet access than most of the developed world, and it's entirely because ISPs have a monopolistic hold on their industry. They have no incentive to do better, because we have no choice.

We're lucky to have even two options in Cincinnati (though that only gets us so far), most people only have one, but Google coming to town would not only give us the option of working with a good provider, and also force the bad (Cincinnati Bell) and terrible (Time Warner) providers to do better. 




 I do agree, we are lucky to have a choice (most people don't), and it's nice that some people in the area can get gigabit speed (though sadly I'm not one of them).

That said, Cincinnati Bell's not that much better than Time Warner in terms of customer service/relations, so it would be nice to have a good company like Google come in and raise the bar for customer experience, service, pricing, etc.. 




 Three things to consider:

1. Cincinnati Bell's gigabit service isn't available everywhere. It's certainly not available to me, or I'd be using it. I'm not sure that they offer fiber everywhere yet, either.
2. Competition will force Bell and Time Warner to do better. There's a reason Time Warner and Comcast are among the worst companies in America, and that's the monopoly that they have on their industry. We're lucky to have a second option, though Cincinnati Bell doesn't raise the bar very much. Google most definitely will.
3. Cincinnati Bell's customer service sucks. It's not as bad as Time Warner's, but it's pretty bad. I can't speak to Google's customer service, but they have a reputation for doing things right and for not trying to do everything as cheaply as possible.

3 is the biggest factor as far as I'm concerned. It would be nice to have a faster connection, but the thing I hate the most about our situation is having to choose between Cincinnati Bell (bad) or Time Warner (incredibly bad, and only going to get worse when they've merged with Comcast) and dreading every interaction that I have with them. 




 Did your parents not notice this pattern and perhaps stop taking your brother's (only) word for everything? 




 [There were a number of them in 2014](https://mayday.us/), and will almost definitely be more in 2016. Mostly democrats, but a few republicans and independents as well. 




 Working (if you can), watching Netflix, playing a game, reading an article, reading a book, looking out the window, Skyping with family/friends, etc.. Pretty much whatever you want to do.

If you want to stare at the car ahead of you, like you would be if you were driving the car, then go for it. But I'm guessing most people would/could find ways to put that time to better use if they didn't have to concentrate on the road.

You'll basically have more options (and a safer journey) than you do now. 




 Sorry, I just had futurgasm

 STV is a little different, in that it's a form of proportional representation. It's basically RCV with multiple seats, which pretty much eliminates the problem of gerrymandering, as well as provides better (proportional, if you will) representation. STV is definitely better, but not every seat can be made into multiple seats (mayors, governors, treasurers, the president, etc.), and where we can't, RCV is the way to go.

Here are videos describing each system:

[RCV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE list=UU2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w)

 Actually, it's already in use all over the country. Colleges and director boards love it (because it's way superior), and even a few cities (e.g. Oakland, San Francisco, and Minneapolis) are already using it.

I totally take your point, though, a whole state adopting it for all elections would be a fantastic example with significant visibility. 




 It's rather unfathomable that marijuana could be legal recreationally but not medically. 




 Well, on behalf of everyone who thinks that women should be able to feed their children wherever without fear of judgement, harassment, stares, etc., thank you all for doing this. As you can see, there's quite a bit of support behind your message, and while there are certainly some regrettable opinions on the matter, I think it will definitely help to (to at least a tiny degree) further the discussion and affect positive societal change. 




 Cool! So how did it come about? 




  but the fact that women can have their breast out in public but I can't have my penis out in public.

You think that women being able to be topless in public, just as men can (as of the 1930's, I might add), would create an inequality? 




 Proof? 




  but pulling out your breasts for all the world to see is overkill and honestly quite rude.

Do you wear a t-shirt at the beach? 'Cause you've got 'em, too. 




  witty

Doubtful. 




 It's for people like you that I post these things. That's not healthy, and it's not your fault. It's society's.

Well, it's more for the nursing mothers who still have the fear, and the experience, of harassment. But for you, too! 




 Fantastic! I'd love to see more of your work. 




 Probably. This just relates to federal law. Individual state laws would still apply.

I'm not a lawyer, though.  




 Same.  




 This is one of the strongest arguments in favor of legalization. Not only is prohibition completely ineffective (and counter productive), but in leaving everything to the black market and cartels (including revenue), marijuana isn't regulated at all. 




 Here's hoping (against all prior evidence). 




 change it when faced with a good enough reason to do so

Sadly, she only changed her mind when faced with a *personal* reason (her son's medicinal needs for marijuana). The good reasons for legalization have always been there.

I agree with your message, and I certainly applaud this woman for recognizing her mistake and trying to right it, but I don't think she's exactly a role model for open-mindedness. I'm fairly certain she would still be opposing it if she hadn't had that personal experience, like the many conservatives that oppose gay marriage until a member of their family comes out. 




  Just because some senile old woman wants medical marijuana doesn't make it any more stupid.

Did you maybe mean to say "less stupid"? 




  Just not sure why people want to put another poison in their body

You say "another", but the thing is, marijuana is already ubiquitous. Kids often choose weed because it's easier to get than beer. If prohibition worked that would be one thing, but all it does is funnel money to drug dealers, gangs, and ultra violent cartels, instead of into the economy and into the hands of tax payers. It's entirely counterproductive.

And not only is there a ton of weed out there, it's all entirely unregulated. I know a guy that unknowingly smoked some laced with formaldehyde and it really messed him up.

Furthermore, it's rather senseless to prohibit marijuana and not alcohol and tobacco, when the first is far less dangerous (if dangerous at all) than the other two.

I should point out that I've never tried marijuana, and have no plans to even once it's legal, but I push hard for legalization because it would be a really beneficial thing for the country. I agree there are higher priority issues, but prohibition causes some very significant problems (and really doesn't prevent any), so it shouldn't be on the bottom of the list either. The political will is there, and it's something most people agree upon, so let's do it.

**TL;DR** - Keeping marijuana illegal causes some major problems, serves almost no purpose, and is easily corrected, so let's solve the issues we can while we work on the others. 




 What are identify politics? 




 Identity politics?

Also, while the republicans are certainly starting to come on board, it's the democratic party that has been leading the way on legalization. 




 I assumed when it fell that you had just shut off the current. It just did that on its own? 




 Chris Rock? 




 I agree, but this really bothers me. If I tell you something in confidence, and you tell someone else, you've violated the trust that I've placed in you. Who you told isn't a factor. 




 How does this video have 4k upvotes, but only 579 views? 




 Explain? 




 Exactly how I feel. I hope the more open bill passes, but I'll take both over nothing. 




 The first Eastern state to legalize is going to make a ton of money. 




 Edit: You may vote for as many as you want, so you don't have to choose this one over others if you support it.

 If increasing your water intake doesn't help, consider if you're getting enough vitamin D. I used to get soylent headaches very frequently, and adding a vitamin D supplement every few days helped me, and now I almost never get soylent headaches.

 Worry not! You can still watch the show, assuming you can afford [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight) ;). 




 Season 2 just started. 




 I know! I don't have any sort of cable, let alone HBO, and I've seen the main segment of every episode. It's awesome.  




 Yes. Sadly it has like 10 names. I think RCV is the best, as it's the most descriptive, but IRV is a little more accurate. 




 For inherently single-seat races, definitely, though I'd prefer [proportional representation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8XOZJkozfI list=PLqs5ohhass_QZtSkX06DmWOaEaadwmw_D) where possible. 




 Works for me. Try again? 




 Check out WolfPAC. They're doing something about it right now. There are a number of other organizations working towards the goal as well. 




 Even if it were 99%, would you really deny the 1% the medicine they legitimately need just to deny the rest legal access to pot they'd likely have no problem getting illegally? 




 Thanks for pointing that out. Deleted. 




 Amazing what a little competition can bring to a monopolized market. What do they call that, again? Capitalism? 




 Yeah, literally. 




 The manzier! 




 Guys already wear bikini tops on go topless day out of solidarity for women who are still forced to cover up and to protest the double standard. Sends a pretty cool message, I think. 




 The caribou you know are too busy being indicted for tax fraud. 




 That's where I'm at. You can sexualize pretty much any part of the body (legs, abs, etc.). Seems pretty silly to me to arbitrarily hide certain parts. Not only silly, but also counterproductive, as you greatly increase the allure of something by keeping it constantly hidden. 




 Wow. Didn't even think about that. 




 He's probably against people wearing feathers, too, so... 




 Yeah... :( 




 Think we'd be able to tell the difference? 




 This is that. 




 I'd be willing to bet the black market brought in even more the year before, especially since it's still in operation and wasn't heavily taxed and regulated. 




 ? 




 Believe it or not, it used to be illegal for men to be topless in public, too, as recently as the 1930's. I think you wore something akin to a wrestling uniform. 




 As I, and many, many others believe that prohibition is ineffective and counterproductive, yes I do.

Indulge me. Why do you think it should be illegal? 




 No word yet on the state-approved list of garments. 




  The party of small-minded government.

 Why? 




 I wish. The guy also wants to ban yoga pants and beige (skin) colored clothing in public, as well. 




 Without the Alex his opponent was dead to the Abomination. 




 Most of us don't understand it either. It's frustrating, pointless, and harmful on a psychological/emotional level. 




 I was just playing along with the joke... 




 I really hope that you're that guy about everything:

"We're out of mustard."

"This calls for a nude protest." 




 Your name is awesome. "MURGHBURLBUGLBE my dear Watson." 




 Sadly it's 20republicans for the next 2 years. 




 Actually, it used to be illegal for men to be topless in public as recently as the 1930's, if you can believe that. 




 Thank you. It may take us some time to really forgive you, but it's a start. 




 That's where I'm at. I've never used marijuana, and don't intend to even after legalization, but legalization is very important, and if we can get this passed in 2016, it gets us most of what a good legalization bill would, and we can correct it from there.

I know people hate this proposal, and I'd rather see something better passed, too, but I'll take "mostly legal" over "pointlessly  and counter-productively illegal" if that's what we can get. 




 Sure, as long as said settings were appropriate, which is to say anywhere where it would be appropriate for a man to be topless. 




 About 5 years ago I saw my neighbors having sex in the shower with the window wide open. Watched for a couple seconds, thinking if they cared they wouldn't be having sex next to an open window, but then thought "nah, that's not cool", and went to bed. 




 It's a ridiculous double standard that makes absolutely no sense. 




 If the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is going to take the irrevocable step of executing a human being, its capital sentencing system must be infallible."

I agree, and it should only be instated once the system is indeed infallible. Which is to say, never. 




 I bet many do. I'm sure they don't love spending 75% of their time in office raising money for the next term. The democrats will definitely be on board, possibly even a few republicans. 




 Probably because it invariably does. 




 Contact the white house and your federal representatives and express your support. There are also a number organizations, WolfPAC, Mayday.us, and NH Rebellion, to name a few, that are actively working toward this goal (in different ways). Check them out and if you like what you see (WolfPAC's organization is amazing), lend your support to one of them.

Finally, keep an eye on [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik1AK56FtVc).

 Nope. 




 It's free advertising and it doesn't cost them anything. So I don't see why they wouldn't.

That said, they probably won't. 




 I don't know, but I sure hope it's wearing cat-scrubs. 




 Why the ranger guild? 




 Do you wanna Unstable Portal a snowman? 




 I feel like for most situations, Vermont is the right place. 




 Uhh... gimme a minute, I need to switch gears. I almost, yeah... 




 Sure thing. 




 I will say I'm glad that we used one for our honeymoon, because we did a lot, but less involved trip, yeah, this doesn't need to be a thing any more. 




 The laws prevent selling Teslas, not charging them. 




 Well, [replacing FPTP is a good first step](http://www.pressherald.com/2014/11/12/ranked-choice-voting-advocates-gathered-36000-signatures-on-election-day/). 




 Do you own a coal or oil company? If not, I'm not sure why a carbon tax and removing energy subsidies takes money from you. The should also reduce your tax burden, in theory anyway. 




 Well, there's one important distinction:

by demanding substantive change from the two parties in DC.

WolfPAC isn't going through DC. It's attempting to invoke article 5 of the constitution to call a national convention, which wouldn't involve congress (as it is the broken body in question). 
























 I really hate when people give these insignificant morons the attention that they seek by doing and saying awful things. If you detest them, don't give them what they want. Ignore them. 




 This is why I question Blizzard's explanation of poor matchmaking being due to a small player base. Everyone I know that wants to play, can play. The game has pretty much been semi-launched for a while now, and I don't see much changing with launch.

I hope I'm wrong. 




 Contact your representatives and voice support for the measure. Be prepared to say why, as they will most likely ask.

And spread the word. 




 What's next? Handing out seat belts in schools!? 




 Working as intended. 




  They absolutely are not "against" bc.

Not sure about that. They frequently promote "abstinence only" policies.

 They're against public funding for it.

That's true enough, though why it's preferable to pay significantly more for the costs of unwanted pregnancies, rather than paying much less to prevent them, is beyond me.

I'm pretty liberal, though, so paying $X for social policies to prevent $6X in long-term costs is right up my alley. 




  abortions were down 40%

The "pro-life" party in action. 




 I think Jaina is the hero that has the most variability. I feel I'm making a choice at every level, which is fantastic. For most heroes, I have a set build that doesn't change, or if it's only one or two talents that might change situationally. Some heroes I have two builds that are like that.

Jaina is the only one that I play where everything is in flux at almost every level, and I love that about her. Almost all of her talents feel viable and useful, and very few of them stand out as the "correct" choice for every situation. 




 Yeah, probably. But likely lower than if we fail to adequately address climate change. 




 I guess is that they'll be closer to actual prices, given that we subsidize fossil fuels rather heavily. 




 Oh, ha. I never take that talent. Thanks for pointing that out. 




 I might care, if I didn't buy my current Moto X on the promise that it would get fast updates, and am approaching 6 months of waiting for the last update.

Probably going Samsung on my next phone. 




 Here are the ones that I've come up with off the top of my head:

* A Starcraft non-combat support unit like an overlord, raven, arbiter, etc., that has no actual combat abilities, just provides information, buffs, and infrastructure.
* A starcraft builder, like a probe that literally just builds things.
* Ragnaros - literally can't leave the base as he has to inhabit a building at all times. 




  Well, my advice for every gaming site is to copy Rock Paper Shotgun to the letter. They are the only ones I know that are doing it right.

What are you referencing here? What is it that they do that you like? I'm not familiar with them and nothing really stood out as I dug around a bit. 




 Yup. Me too.

TL;DR - Me too. 




 Kinda defeats the point... 




 Grats!

How do you deal with really bad teams? 




 Agreed. Very sad to see that his trait is still not being addressed.

  Leave it to PolitiFact to find a way to rate a completely true statement "mostly false".

It's technically true, but certainly not actually true. You really don't see the distinction? 




 [Wouldn't it be great if you had more than two choices?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE list=UU2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w) 




 You'd hardly be the first, but by all means. 




 What have they distorted? 




 You eat all the cookies. Your mom asks if you ate all the cookies. You say no, because there are billions of cookies still in the world that you did not eat.

Just because what you said was technically true does not mean that you did not lie. 




 You really don't see a problem with distortions of the truth? 




 Don't forget religious freedom. 




 Sgt.Hammer decides to go mines alone.

Hammer's wrong.

Sgt Hammer entered siege mode and died almost instantly.

Hammer's wrong.

she rages

Hammer's wrong. 




 Fair enough, though I wouldn't really call confirming something that he said an attack. 




 Not sure anything is worse than free Hammer week. "Don't worry, guys. I'm sieged!" 




 I feel sorry for people who feel the need to rub it in whenever they have a good move or victory. Why isn't winning enough? 




  Sure, you will get some buildings down before you die but I doubt you will reach a fort this way.

I do it all the time.

Don't get me wrong, I think the team should be there to support the terror, but even if they aren't, I think it can still be very effective. 




 You can do a lot of damage with the terror, even if the enemy is responding. You just need to bounce between forts and try and maximize your W. You might not get a fort, especially if *your* team is ignoring you (which is a pretty big mistake), but you'll still make them feel it. And if your team does show up, you'll really do some significant damage. A fort at least. 




 You mean checking the facts of politicians? I agree. 




 I'm not sure I agree. A well-used terror can easily get 2-3 forts. That's massive. If the other team is ignoring my terror and it results in a 4v5, I think it's on my team to simply play safely while I absolutely wreck the opposing team.

The only times that I think it's all that appropriate to fight as the terror are:

1. If you're near enough to a kill/fight that you can secure it without sinking too much time into it.
2. If you're in desperate need of defense.

Perhaps I'm wrong, but in my experience, you want the terror pushing, especially if the other team is letting you do it. 




 inform themselves of optimal strategies

Agreed, but I think it's worth pointing out that this is not a case of a "non-optimal strategy" so much as it's a "rather significant mistake". 




 Hearthstone crawls. It goes months, often many months, without an update. 




  Also dislike having it select according to team composition, though i can understand and respect that change

I feel the same way. It's pretty much just a "random support" button. But it's better than the alternative. 




 I'd really like to see Mephisto, Baal, Maltheal, or any of the members of the Angiris council. 




 I've updated them many times over the last year. I try and stay current. 




 Zagara is incredibly strong. She dishes out insane amounts of damage from far away and has the ability to zone enemies out very effectively. She almost always dominates her lane, can hold her own in many 1v1 situations (though it's usually a game of chicken), and she's awesome to have in a team fight, especially, though not exclusively, thanks to the incredible power of maw.

Her only serious weakness is her lack of an escape before 20, and you can compensate for that with creep by keeping your route to safety covered and using it to see threats early enough to run.

TL;DR - Zagara is always awesome, just be prepared and informed well enough to run in time, while murdering anything and everything that you don't like (for the swarm, of course). 




  Lv7 Death Touch: A noob trap talent, you should never take this. Frozen Tempest already provides enough damage to kill minions. 

Reminds me of Possession. 




 This is a good idea for Blizzard, because personally speaking, I would never, ever buy anything requiring a timed commitment like that. It would seriously piss me off if I bought a stimpack and then got slammed with work and couldn't use it or something.

If it was based on actual game time or game count, I'd actually consider buying one, but the current form is definitely not an option. 




 Something I ask myself every time I see things like one team having two tanks and no supports, and the other team having two supports and no tanks. Could ya maybe have just... 




 Do many vikings players really soak 3 lanes? Unless it's during an objective, I don't see much purpose to this. I typically put Olaf in a solo lane and keep Baelog and Erik together. As long as you have at least one other person soaking the third lane, you're not gaining anything by putting a viking in it, and you're giving up attention, viking safety, and some pushing ability.

What's the point of having vikings in all 3 lanes? 




 Great save! 




 He's referring to sites like politifact, that attempt to confirm or disprove what politicans say. 




 I disagree. AC could be a 4/3 today and still wouldn't see much play, if any.

OP didn't ask about today. He asked about when I started playing.

 You're not considering the fact that because self driving cars will be much safer, they'll be able to drive a lot faster. So if it's truly a matter of time and patience, you're a lot better off taking those 2 minutes to set up your destination, because you're probably going to get there 30% sooner if you let the car drive.

Also, as has been stated, the state of technology is such that your phone likely knows where you're about to go before you do. So 2 minutes is likely over estimated by about 2 minutes. 




 Looks slick. Wish the gif were a little larger so I could see it better.

Great work! 




  tl;dr: the driver must pay attention at all times to avoid anything the car can't.

Maybe, but not necessarily. Google has recently adopted the stance that a human driver is not a reliable backup for an automated car. A person trying to correct the car's decision making would likely cause more issues than they would prevent.

Of course, we're in very uncharted territory, so we'll see if that pans out or not. 




 It's not a stupid question at all. It's one that is frequently asked, as a matter of fact.

The short answer is yes, it's very possible, and it's something the industry is going to have to account for. 




 I mean after this guy has called for a recorded vote. For example:

17 representatives in the room, Boehner says it's 218, guy runs in and asks for a recorded vote, they count and record a vote, and it's now very clear that there were nowhere near 218. Why hasn't Boehner committed a crime by saying there was? That rule exists for a reason, and he has very obviously broken it. 




 If this angers you, why give them free publicity? They publish outrageous and crazy things to get people's attention, and clearly it's worked on you. 




 Serious question: when Boehner declares a quorum of 218 congressmen, and then the actual count commences and then it is proved that there are like 30 congressmen there, why doesn't Boehner go to jail? Is that not a blatant and undeniable example of fraud and abuse?

And are the records of these obviously false quorums publicly available? I'd love to see what he's tried to get away with. 




  The people in power are afraid it could actually pass

Just the republicans. The democrats voted in favor of legalization. 




 List them? 




  I always thought they were FOR personal freedoms, am I just mistaken?

You are mistaken.

 Beats me. I just play the game. 




 He's super fun and very effective. I don't think he's considered a top-tier hero, but I certainly enjoy playing him. 




 I've had to forfeit several winning games because of this, now that the game is available on mobile. It's my own fault for trying to squeeze in very fast games, but it still sucks. 




 Impressive. Great work! 




 Clever. I like it. 




 Many, even those of us with relatively high end machines, suffer from periods of lower frame rates (30), stutters, etc.. The hope has always been that the game hasn't been optimized yet, and that it would be before launch. 




 What do we think the difference between "open beta" and "launched" will be? 




 As long as you're actually going to monetize it. If it's just going to sit in a repo and die, you might as well let open source it. Otherwise your work is just going to waste.

Looks fantastic, BTW. Would love to hear how you did it. 




 Looks great! Nice job.  




 Thank you. Is totally confused.  




 Sure, here are several key points.

1. Prohibition doesn't work. People that want pot can get pot, and all we're doing is denying ourselves the opportunity to tax and regulate it. It's the exact same thing that happened during alcohol prohibition. In fact, many kids choose pot over beer because it's easier to get.
2. We're taking money and jobs out of the legitimate economy, and giving it directly to gangs, drug dealers, and ultra violent cartels, who, along with marijuana, deal in harder drugs, weapons, and slaves (and who knows what else). To say nothing of the massive tax revenue, and the fact that we're packing for-profit prisons
3. Marijuana is very likely a gateway drug, not because people that use it are inspired on to harder drugs, but because anyone that wants pot has to know a drug dealer. CVS is not going to push meth while it's selling you pot, but your normal weed hook
4. Weed is, by virtually all accounts, harmless. In a free society, you don't need a reason to make something legal, you need one to make it illegal.
5. We're packing for-profit prisons and destroying the lives of many law-abiding citizens. We lock them up, ruining their jobs/careers, and when we do release them, they're now in a harder situation and with many more criminal contacts.
6. We're arbitrarily denying people medicine and treatments that could really help them. Medical marijuana is often the only thing that can relieve pain and siezures for many people, and is now even being shown to be an effective treatment to some types of cancer. People are suffering, and in some cases dying, all in the name of (not really) inhibiting the use of recreational substance far less harmful (if harmful at all) than alcohol.
7. The only people who have something to lose by legalization are drug dealers, cartels, for-profit prisons (and the industry built around the monetization of incarceration), and beer companies. The rest of society, even non-smokers (like myself, don't plan on ever even trying it) will benefit almost immeasurably.

Oh, you said arguments *against* legalization! Yeah, I've got nothing there... 




 Well, if you lock them out for a period of time, those players will simply be in (and thus leave) fewer games. 




 Legitimate disconnects and reasons to leave the game exist, sure. I'm talking about the ones that do it frequently. The first one each week should be free. If you're quitting more than that, it's almost surely not due to emergencies. 




 It's entirely redundant with her kit, it serves absolutely no purpose in a team fight, and Wailing Arrow is insanely good.

Honestly, if you removed the increased CD for mercs, I'd still take Wailing Arrow. 




 Sounds good to me. 




 I think so. 




 Yeah. Maybe the first game you quit you can't queue until it's over, but the second in a week gets you a 24 hour suspension, with higher and higher times.

Clearly these people aren't that interested in playing the game anyway, and the rest of us sure won't miss them. 




  I still don't see what the benefits are of legalizing it other than some hypothetical talk about how much money it'll bring in from taxes.

It's far from hypothetical. Look how much Colorado has already brought in.

I don't want people getting stoned and then possibly getting behind the wheel or doing something that ends up hurting or killing someone else.

Here's the core thing to focus on: prohibition isn't prevent people from using pot. They already are. Tons and tons of them. Many kids choose weed over beer because it's a lot easier to get. The only things we're doing by making it illegal is giving up the opportunity to regulate it, and funding criminal enterprises. 

If they go making it legal for cancer patients as a pain management drug, do they really believe those patients are going to be the only ones using it?

This is a particularly disturbing comment. If you'd let people suffer in an attempt to keep other people from using marijuana recreationally, I think you really need to re-examine your priorities.

Sure it might slow down the black market for pot

When is legal all across the country, there will be no black market. If you want proof, try and find a liquor bootlegger.

the bigger problem is what pot does to you when you smoke it.

Alcohol is far more harmful than pot. Do you support a return to alcohol prohibition as well?

TL;DR - Prohibition doesn't keep people from using marijuana, and it does far more damage than it prevents (if it prevents any at all). 




 Didn't mean to. Thanks for letting me know. 




 The problem is that in almost all cases, you're better off closing the distance and doing something else.

Much of the time, yes, but not almost all of the time. Knowing the difference is what makes it good.

It's not that the long-range banelings are a hard-to-land skillshot on the Zagara players' part

It's not always about landing the banelings. Often it's about zoning your opponent out.

Anyway, feel free to disagree. I think it's a good talent. 




 The only thing I disagree with is that Baneling Range isn't good. I find it very useful. When you get good enough with it, you can put it to some really great effects, such as cutting enemies off from a route of escape, splitting them up, dissuading a chase you want to avoid, disrupting objectives, adding presence to a fight from afar, etc.

I'm not saying that it's better than the regeneration, but it's definitely a worthwhile talent, once you've gotten good with it. 




 That number, and the ones in the comments, are way, way lower than I would have thought them to be.

Reddit has a maximum population of Ohio... 




 True. It's not a bad pick. I just prefer Hardened Shield. 




 Really clever. Nicely done.

I build a little differently, though:

4: Amplified Healing if we have a healer, if not deadly strike if their team is especially squishy, Swift Reflexes otherwise. SR is nice, but Chen is unbelievably tanky as is, and chances are SR is going to proc during a shield.

13: Enough To Share - most enemies are smart enough to not attack Chen, so extending your shield to allies while you drink is quite valuable in a team fight.

16: Bolder Flavor - You can survive just about anything with this.

20: Hardened Shield - Makes you truly unkillable. I really just take this, though, because the other options aren't fantastic. Bolt of the Storm is redundant with Flying Kick, and the barrel is plenty strong as is. Kind of a lackluster level 20 for Chen. 




 Good for you. Never give up! 




 I agree, but I do really like that there are hybrid heroes like Tassadar, Sonya, Sylvanas, etc., so if there is a change made in this direction, I'd like it to be a small one. 




 This deck was great a couple of weeks ago, but now I can't win with it to save my life. It's just far too slow. Unless I draw early innervates and wild growths (which I mulligan for aggressively), by the time I have enough mana to play anything of value I'm instead spending my turn on healbots to prevent my inevitable demise. Even with the early mana cards, face hunters burn me down too quickly, and I often don't have a way to play around mirror entity. As mages and hunters make up 90% of play right now, those are two very big problems.

Suggestions? 




 What he said:

Despite what Republicans may want you to think, unrestricted free trade is not a Constitutional right.

Your response:

Republicans aren't out to wreck the country just because you don't agree with them on everything.

Quite a leap you took there. 




 As much as I'd like to see poor neglected Diablo get a 7th hero, Fenix would be my first choice as well. I think they could make a really interesting hero out of a zealot, Starcraft needs a warrior, and while they're certainly in better shape than Diablo, they could definitely use a little loving to help balance out Warcraft's dominance of the roster.

And Protoss are cool. 




 That would put it about 3 weeks away, which would really suck. 




 I really hope it's a Diablo or Starcraft hero, especially if it fills a role gap for those franchises (support and warrior respectively). 




 I really want to see Mephisto, Baal, Izzul, Malthael, or one of the other members of the Angiris Council. 




 Making him slightly weaker than the Hearthstone version. 




  Get your shit together republicans.

 Is this a quote from something awesome? 




 Write an op ed.  




 Did it eat the freezing trap? 




 Are you under the impression that people can't get weed now?

Let see how the younger generation is effected, as teens become more frequent users.

Many kids choose pot because it's easier to get than beer. I'd be amazed if actually regulating marijuana, instead of effectively ignoring it, doesn't decrease teen use. 




 Instructions unclear. Punched friend in genitals. Did not hurt. 




 Constance Justice 




 Tyrael. Total bad ass and bully. If only he had a trait.  




 My favorites are Master Tyrael (both white, which I run, and black), and the green Hellscream Thrall.  




 Black master Tyrael is great, but I like the white one better. Fits his character better, and as a tank I want to have a big, bright presence.  




 It's gotten a lot worse lately, too. Never used to be much of a problem but now I see it somewhat frequently. I wonder if I've just dropped in MMR to a place where these immature players are more frequently seen.  




 Suggestion: buy a hero. 




 Or the state could just stop murdering people. That sounds like a pretty good plan. 




 And how will we deal with all of the glaciers!? 




 Majordomo, a legendary so bad that you're better off giving him to your opponent. 




 "These games wouldn't be as good if it wasn't for the opponent across from me".

Classy guy. Wins handily, but he's still gracious enough to compliment his opponent. That's the demeanor of a true champion. 




 "Even though some might say this is just a teenage prank, who knows what this teenager might have done," Nocco said.

Based on that logic, you could charge somebody with murder for picking up a knife. "Who knows how many people he might have stabbed!" 




 There are a number of issues with it, but the primary one, at least as far as I'm concerned, is that it actually makes you *more likely* to die, as it's factored into his kit's balance. In other words, if it didn't exist, they would have to buff him in some other way to keep him balanced. The more they buff his death, the weaker he is while alive, and thus, less likely to remain so. 




 Cool concept, but having faced him in Hearthstone, I don't know that I could take that much of the voice actor. 




 Tyrael just needs a better trait and he'd be fine. He's really fun, and very effective, but his trait pretty much doesn't exist.

A minor stat buff might not be untoward, either, as his stats are very low across the board, but the trait is the bigger issue. 




 Do we think this is for real?

I, for one, would love to see faster hero releases. One of the best things about this game is the variety of the heroes and their playstyles, and I can't wait to get my hands on more. 




 Tyrael is a full tank, he is designed to soak damage, not die.

I main Tyrael, and I build him very tanky, but I disagree with this. I think he does a better job initiating and bullying than soaking damage. He's not squishy by any means, but I would consider him an off-tank, not a full tank.

I think that would change if he had a worthwhile trait that contributed to his survivability, though. 




 The big problem with death traits is that they're factored into a hero's balance, meaning not only does Tyrael's trait do nothing to keep him alive, it actually makes him *more likely* to die, as the rest of his kit pays some price for his death explosion. 




 Disrupting the enemy's positioning momentarily is *very* little recompense for losing your tank. 




 The problem is that death traits suck. They're basically a small reward for being bad, and they do absolutely nothing for you while you're alive.

You could buff his trait to oblivion and it would still suck. 




 Agreed. His trait is practically non-existent. It does nothing while he's alive, and hardly anything when he dies as it's both easily avoided, it's almost never enough damage to get a kill, and even if you do get a kill, your team is now missing a tank.

The big problem with death traits is that they're factored into a hero's balance, meaning not only does Tyrael's trait do nothing to keep him alive, it actually makes him more likely to die, as the rest of his kit pays some price for his death explosion.

It'd be much better if he had something that helped *avoid* his death, rather than making his death slightly inconvenient for the enemy team.

Here's my idea:

 **Archangel's Watch**
 
 Every time a hero deals damage to Tyrael, that hero gains a stack of guilt which decreases damage done to Tyrael by 0.5% per stack. Upon reaching a maximum of 10 stacks, the hero is deemed guilty and one of Tyrael's wings reaches out and grasps the hero. Guilty heroes are always revealed and have an additional 5% of the damage they deal to Tyrael reflected back at them.
 
 If a hero leaves Tyrael's area of influence, all of that hero's guilt is forgiven, and if Tyrael or any of his enemy heroes dies, all enemy guilt is forgiven.

This gives Tyrael some additional survivability (after a while he's taking up to 10% less damage from heroes focusing him), and it's very thematic. You shall pay for your sins, but an enemy's sacrifice can absolve you of your guilt. And Tyrael does use his wings when he fights, because he's a bad ass. 




 Thanks! 




 Good advice. I almost didn't ask for this reason, though I'm still curious. 




 How can you see their rank if they talk? 




 Welcome! Glad you're having fun :) 




 It could even be a boat! 




 If they bring the cast back together and make the show snappy once more, then I'm excited. Season 4 was just a terrible, confusing, poorly paced, unfunny mess, and if it's more of that, then I'm not even going to bother watching. 




 What's wrong with that song? 




 This is huge. I was really disappointed when they removed the AWD option from the 60. Not that I could afford $70k, let alone $75k, but it's nice to know that if I could, that I again would. 




 Agreed. The Kerrigan text is on screen for literally less than 2 seconds.

I would pull this down and put some more time into it. 




 Why Overload? I get your point about not being able to take advantage of Conjurer's Pursuit, but what does the extra range get you that's worth losing the mana that comes from Psi-Infusion? 




 This is why I'm really glad that there's no surrender option. I've been down like this and come back. I know it's rare, but I'm glad that I always have the option to try. 




 Life finds a way. 




 Do you keep inane amounts if glitter on hand for such an occurrence? Or would you have to go (hopefully) buy some? 




 Diversity is healthy for the party. Also, I consider myself a liberal, not a democrat. 




 What does "Basalisk" refer to in this instance? Is that the name given to the theoretical killer robot? 




 Bad form. 




 It is awkward, but play him enough and you'll get surgical with positioning it. It's a feel thing, and it comes in time.

And yeah, I generally ignore the speed boost. It's nice, and on some occasions I factor it in, like if I'm not in any danger but an ally is, I'll use it along with my Q and W to help them escape. But largely I just use it for the damage.

 When I went to WWDTM a couple weeks ago (with Richard Price), I had *so* much fun

You snuck the body of [an 18th century Welsh moral philosopher and nonconformist peacher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Price) into a taping of WWDTM?

Impressive. 




 Agreed. I've come back from some pretty staggering deficits, as well as been on the other end of that stick. The fact that you can be way down, but win a crucial team fight that positions you for the win means that every single fight matters.

One of my favorite things about this game is that it's not over until it's truly over. Players that understand this will have an edge over those that don't, and that's a good thing. 




 Cool!!! Eventually! Someday. Maybe... 




 Awesome! Thanks for posting this.

I know that they mentioned having problems with the chipset, but if fast updates where part of the phones promotion, and it's been this long and we still don't have the latest update, then it's going to make me not want to do business with that company in the future.

This is the big dissuading factor for me, as well. It took 2 months to get 4.4.4, too, and we never even got 4.4.3. 




 Hence the fact checking... 




 The question is, what *did* I do? 




 Good idea, but that didn't have any impact.

Thanks for the suggestion.

 What is "this"? 




 Awesome! 




 I agree. Any time I've used Possession, I've thought wondered what picking up an extra minion per wave was really doing for me, considering how hard I could push lanes anyway.

More importantly, though, was during team fights, I was really wishing I had something that was useful in a team fight...

I like the charge idea a lot. 




 You mean because yesterday was 3/29? ;) 




 I don't know, I didn't go in a Burger King. 




 Thanks. 




 Glad to see both shaman cards are good. Almost as glad I was to see that both mage cards are weak. 




 He's probably referring to the arena where warrior is extremely weak. 




 How did you check your average game length? Time a few? 




 How does one keep game times down? Really fast decks and forfeiting a lot? 




 Pre-grats!

What's your secret? Incredible patience? Do you forfeit a lot to stay at lower ranks and get better opens? 




 'Cause of the metric system? 




 Quartermaster with cheese? 




 Great site. Just need something to deal with the trolls. Auto-hide functionality based on downvotes is probably ideal, but in the meantime you might want to delete some of the more egregious ones.

Also the ability to un-vote would be nice. So clicking downvote twice would bring you back to having not-voted, like reddit does.

Thanks for the effort! 




 How can you see the ranks of your teammates? 




 Though probably not the one he intended to make :P. 




 Great idea. That works be super cool. 

I love the interactions between the heroes. I wish their were more of them.  




 For #2, I generally find the reverse to be true. The more pushed our lanes are, the farther we are from our towers. That's why I try not to push without a good reason (e.g. upcoming objectives). 

Is my thinking flawed? 




 Around $80USD.  




 How did you play it? Straight push? Run from fights and ignore objectives? 




 It's not correct, but it's accepted. "He" and "she" are singular, "their" is plural.

Many of us use "their", though, because "he or she" is very cumbersome, and there just isn't a better alternative (yet). 




 Done. Thanks for the suggestion. 




 My first thought as well. The immortal's shield doesn't proc on lethal damage, but I think it's close enough. 




 Who said anything about the immortal being Fenix? 




 If it's early September it will only come out approximately 2 years before the 2013 gets 5.0.2.

I wonder if the Moto X 2019 will be released before we get 5.1.

Bitter. 




 Similarly, don't pee *into* the hot tub, either. 




 The music was depressing. Kind of killed it for me. 




 Makes sense. I'm just surprised that he uses it for fine work, too. That has to take some serious mastery. 




 Great tips! Would love to hear more.

Thanks for sharing! 




 Got it. Thanks. 




 Makes sense. Really I just want to know if 90 is low or high, and what that number being lower or higher means. 




 Poor Tyrael really needs some love. 




 Fantastic!

One suggestion: lose Title, Role, and Franchise. They don't really provide much (especially title), and they take up valuable horizontal real-estate.

Thanks for putting this together! 




 Before this current free hero rotation, I swear I hadn't seen him within my last 100 games. Not once, on either side. 




 Nice shot. That had to feel good. 




 Which episode is it from? 




 What is this referencing? Sunny? 




 And Ainsley gets to pee in Leo's closet? 




 I say pack token, and if we're going down that road anyway, also implement golden card tokens as arena (but not pack) prizes. These let you change a card of an appropriate rarity golden (e.g.an epic token can make a common, rare, and epic token).
