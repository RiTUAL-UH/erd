 That's how mine occur. During daytime naps. 




 Hell yeah! I was watching that the other day. Awesome thermos. 




 Wth? What are the odds you'd be browsing this thread after that particular comment? 




 Forget reasonably priced, I'd like one to start with. Damn Mississippi is so behind the rest of the country. 




 I haven't read any t replied just yet but I'm gonna say what's probably been said, time machine or a device to simply alter the speed of time. 




 KFC double down isn't available here, such sad. So much sad. 




 I love the peanut butter twix 




 I buy em here in Cleveland MS all the time.  




 I do this. Idc who watches. Be jealous.

 I've got my bed next to my computer desk and my desk is at the right height so my computer is perfectly level. My tv is a few feet from the foot of my bed. Talk about perfect laziness. All my favorite movies and shows are on my computer which is connected to my Blu-ray so I don't have to even get up to change the movie. Ultimate laziness. I even keep a couple snacks and bottled beverages bedside. 




 I'd buy $100m worth of bacon and burn it on live cam and upload it all over the net. 




 Not if he finds this and knows it's you. 




 About once a month or so, I have a recurring dream. Though all the details aren't exactly the same, the main plot is. The dream: I'll be minding my business going along dream world doing whatever when all of a sudden I'm a couple feet off the floor just floating there. I can control where I float to pretty easily. I'll usually float around for a few minutes enjoying myself. After a while a sudden blanket of fear over comes me. The only sound I can make is a wailing banshee or ghost like sound. I hear it in my dream and out loud. My wife wakes me up because it freaks her out. By the way, I can not mimic the sound while I'm awake, it's a way higher pitched sound than I can consciously make. My question to you Reddit is can anyone help me understand what could possibly be going on? Also, has anyone of you experienced anything similar? 




 Anna Gunn. Why not?  




 "White's only pies!"+ runs and eats scalding hot pie. 




 I had one of those blow up pillow fight things or whatever. You put your fist in and beat each other senseless. I immediately felt regretful. 









 I believe I have something like that in both my ears 




 All I can say about most of this is, yes some customers are dicks. The thing is most of you are complaining about customers doing regular customer stuff. Customers have every right to pay with whatever method the store promises to accept. Customers shouldn't put money in their mouths out bras or whatever it's gross. If a customer wants to use a coupon that isn't expired and they have the product the coupon promises to cover, then you can't be mad at a customer for holding up the line. It's not the customer's fault if some stores punish cashiers for slow time. A lot of the comments on here are ridiculous. Maybe you should find a different job. I worked retail and ran into the same stuff. What was different for me? I actually know how to work in retail. Stop complaining about customers being customers. That's like saying babies shouldn't cry or dogs shouldn't bark. If a price rings up wrong and a customer complains about it there is a great chance they aren't accusing you off fixing the wrong price they are being human and just blaming the nearest person. Not everyone that comes through your line thinks like you. Some of your customers have never worked retail, they only know what it's like to be a customer. You find certain things to be "simple" or "common sense" but that's because you're around it all the time. I bet some of your cruddy customers find other things to be "simple" or "common sense" that you might not immediately do the same wary they do. Customers are the reason your job exists. 




 People are stupid. That's what self check out is for. ;-) 




 Not everyone can see well enough to see the menu board until they reach the front. Though I do understand the frustration. 




 Not sure if it's been said but seems like a drop off intended for someone else to find. Maybe it's been too long since breaking bad ended. Either way, pretty cool. 




 That's that hurry up and wait mentality that I miss. 














 I would also have been scared if an Apple iPhone was crawling out of a sewage grate too. 




 I still would love to know how I make driving annoying when he is the one who can't follow the laws and almost caused an accident 




 Because he was in the right by running a stop sign right? 




 I have plenty victories i just don't like being cut off and almost being rear ended when he should have stopped like he was supposed to by law 




 I wasn't in a hurry due to being late i was 30 minutes early. I just didn't want to wait for the last minute to clock in 




 It was a school bus without passengers. You should have read everything 




 Darn it sucks you think it's lame jcravenw, because I posted this just for you. Simple does not equal lame. 




 The taco shell was lop sided 




 Also my thanks was more of a "I'm glad someone else enjoyed one of my all time favorites.  




 I wasn't taking someone else's credit. Like I said. I've not seen it on here so I had no one to credit on here. I've been telling that joke for years. 




 It's a joke. If you don't understand that then maybe you just need to unsubscribe. 




 I don't look at r/jokes all the time. Actually the day I posted that joke was day one. I don't know anyone who looks for the content they're about to post to see if it might be a repost. Plus just because you've seen it doesn't mean everyone has. Reposts give new subbers like me a chance to see the content. 




 Hr ripped someone off. He doesn't want his son to think it's okay to do that. 




 Thanks 




 Little Johnny likes playing hooky quite often and he hides in his mom's closet until she takes a nap. One day he plays hooky as usual but today a strange guy comes over and he and Johnny's mom have sex. Right as they're finishing up johnny's dad comes home early so the man hides in the closet. The following conversation occurs:
"It's dark in here, huh?"
Shut up kid, I'm hiding.
"Wanna buy my baseball?"
No, shut up!
"I'm gonna tell my daddy on you for what you were doing to my mom"
Fine! I'll buy the damn ball if you shut up. How much?
" 300 dollars"
No way I'm paying that much!
" I'm gonna tell"
Fine, ya rip off! Here.

They swap the money and the ball.

A few days later the strange guy is back at it and Johnny's dad comes home early again and the guy hides in the closet again. The following conversation occurs:
"It's dark in here huh?"
Yeah. Shut up.
" wanna buy a baseball glove?"
No. Not this time.
"I'll tell daddy"
Fine. How much?
" 700 dollars"
No way!
"Yes or I'm gonna scream"

Needless to say, they swap cash for glove.

The next day Johnny's dad asks him if he wants to play catch. Johnny says "that'll be hard to do without my ball and glove." And his dad asks what happened to it. Johnny explains he sold them for $1000.
Infuriated, his dad brings him to church to confess.
He puts Johnny in the booth and the following conversation occurs:
" it's dark in here huh?"
Don't start that shit again you little rip off! 




 Lol. I thought I was the only one. I also put my sack of fast food on there to keep it warm. 









 Yes. Mine is active anywhere there are a mass of people that I don't know. Like if I go to taco bell and the lobby is  full of people particularly in line. I just leave. So yes, a church or a library would trigger it. 




 Oh and I understand "tit for tat" quite well. I grew up with petty siblings, lol. 




 Well I'm glad you've done your research. I'm also glad you've found peace. I just don't see it happening for me. I panic in crowds and that panic makes me frustrated. I will probably live the rest of my life this way. Thanks for the concern. Oh and I am aware that my response isn't much but if I yawn one more time I won't be capable of seeing through my watery eyes. 




 Thanks for the kind words but I never mentioned hating anyone. I hate eating around big groups of people or being around big groups of people. I have been diagnosed with social anxiety. 




 I get the same way. It's like I'd rather die of utter starvation than to be around a bunch of people. I don't care what it is, I wont eat it if there are people (especially ones I don't know or rarely see). I'll be thinking "Ooh there's cake.... *goes to get cake* wait, there's people.. lots and lots of people... fuck it, there's a slight chance there'll be some left" to myself "RETREAT!" 






















































 I love that store. I always go there when I'm at the mall. I love cookies. Makes me happy to eat cookies. 




 Congratulations! Merry Christmas. Good luck with the new house. 




 I want mine to get pregnant too. It's also been difficult. 




 Wow I got all misty eyed. That's sad. I'm glad she was able to see you really enjoy your gift first though. Wow. 




 My wife experienced something similar around that age. Her and her younger sister both woke up around 3 or 4 am and cried because no presents. Their parents had been waiting for the kids to fall asleep and ended up falling asleep themselves. When the girls ran to their parents and were sobbing, they were convinced Santa was just late. After the girls went to bed, both the parents rushed to the hiding spot for the presents and rushed around wrapping them. 




 Same for me. Got married on Halloween. 




 It was 2004. I was walking with my brother "C", his girlfriend at the time "M" and her best friend at the time "B". I was about 16, C, M and B were all about 14/15. A beat up old blue/rusty car full of ghetto looking 30 something guys pulls up next to us, I was on the outside of the group closer to the road. I told everyone to go ahead, these guys looked aggressive. The guy in the passenger seat told me to move and let him get a better look at "her" gesturing at M. I told him fuck off and bring his old ugly car to the junk yard where it belonged. He pulls out a very large pistol and waves it sound and then aims it sideways at me threatening to shoot, the rest of the group had already made it to M's house. I ran and he fired one round and missed then they peeled out in a cloud of smoke. I told my dad about it immediately and we got into his big truck and chased them down. Dad shot at them and they ran off the road. Btw we lived out in a very rural area and the entire police department was friends of my dad. I never saw that little blue car again.

TL;DR: Perverted "gangstas" in old car tried to get to my brother's girlfriend and they ended up getting shot at. 




 Glass bottles full of habanero hot sauce. Bottle brakes and cuts the target. Hot sauce burns open wounds. Win! 




 I had a job as a correctional officer at the local state penitentiary. Loved going to work. I had two regular days off but I would have worked those too if they'd let me. I never took personal time off so it just kept accumulating. It paid pretty poorly for that field of work but I didn't care. I absolutely loved that job. I made a minor mistake in paperwork and was fired. It really sucked because that job had potential.  




 TL;DR: born, lived, expects to die one day. 




 Each episode is exactly one hour and four minutes apart. 11:00, 12:04, 1:08 etc. This is only relevant for the episodes I scrolled through. I'm certain it's relevant to at least the 7th or 8th episode. 




 Another one: breaking bad and Malcolm in the middle. 




 Scrubs and Ground Floor. I know scrubs is over but a guy can dream, can't he? 




 Christmas isn't Christmas without a real Christmas tree because of the smell. I don't care for the artificial crap either. There has never been a more Christmas smell for me. 




 I've tried this twice and the first one it did not guess after asking 60 questions. The first was Greg from Hay Day. It guessed Johnny bravo 




 I hate mountain dew. That crap is horrible. 




 Not do the stupid shit that caused me to lose my job. I probably would have continued to pay off my debt with my dad. Oh the good ole fantasies of paying off debt. 




 "Wait... if this is Mr. Goldman, then why does he still have his foreskin? Then he's not the Jew. Damn he almost lost his left nut." 




 Most of the stuff I read on this thread doesn't bother me but when I got to the sleep paralysis thing, I say nay nay. I suffer it enough on my own along with some PTSD sleep dysfunctions. I don't need any help making it worse. Goodbye to this thread. 




 Just realized most everyone here is mentioning age. I'm 25 btw.

 We must be related... 




 Commercials: Not ALL commercials, just some. If your product is actually worth anything, if it does what it should, great. Advertise the Hell out of it. I could rant about poorly advertised products all week. I'll list an example or two but there are many commercial styles that bug me. Amazon kindle paper white. The commercial where everyone is using it and one person compares the brightness of it to the brightness of the iPad (whichever version). I'm not a fan of Apple products but I can't stand complete and total lying in advertisements. They show both tablets screens and the iPad screen is really dim and the kindle screen is really bright. Words pop up near the iPad the read something to the effect of "The iPad is on". They are insulting the intelligence of the potential consumer. As though we wouldn't realize the iPad's brightness setting is all the way down. The kindle is a great product and can hold its own, in the market. No need to blatantly insult my intelligence and lie about the competition's product. If I had to choose one of the two products I'd go for the kindle if they hadn't produced that commercial. Now I would choose neither because I still don't care for Apple. Now example 2: The wax vac commercial. This style commercial is moronic in its own way. Sticking a q tip in one's ear canal might hurt a bit but I've never experienced or witnessed someone experience pain enough to cause me or anyone else to scream as loudly as he had. "OUCH!" really? Tone it down a bit. If your product is as great as you say, don't make alternate methods look terrible, just make it known your product is better. Be factual about your product vs the other one. Like the viewers have never used a Q Tip.- I'll end this here. 




 Or: keep running all the way. Stay in the Army, you miss it like crazy. You'll regret ruining that opportunity. Everyday, wasted on regret. Every moment, hating yourself. If you stay college is still in your future. 




 Don't get involved with her, just stay in college. Avoid serious relationships until you graduate and find an appropriate career. This way you won't end up unable to be qualified for federal student aid until you pay off that fucking Sallie Mae loan. Then you won't be broke and on Reddit because you have nothing better to entertain yourself with. Also, you won't end up owing your dad and step mom 3 grand and they don't show up at your wedding because you owe them money.... got off track a bit but y'all get the point. 




 I used to stripe parking lots and parking garages in New Orleans. I took home $200 a day (18 hours a day minimum). Katrina hit and bam! I'm here in north Mississippi. 




 I don't know how others feel about him, but uncle grandpa. I hate the idea of this show. 




 Taylor swift... she's fictional right? I mean there couldn't truly be such a talentless dumbass, could there? 




 Laughed...too...much 




 No network connection. Or some form of "Reddit is experiencing heavy traffic. Please try again at a later time."- I've paraphrased. 




 Let's try my name. John, who's the lucky hooker? Hur dur. John, you should be in the bathroom so I can take a shit. Real funny people, after about 25 years, it gets old. 




 I guess I'll hop on the greetings train. Greetings from Cleveland, Mississippi, United states.  




 The season after season 8 of Scrubs. They call it season 9, I call it a pitiful excuse for a sad attempt at a spin off. 




 Would be funnier to do this to the cable/satellite set top boxes because then they'd have to boot up. 




 I've got a better one than my last. I'd be wearing nothing but a tattoo and a smile. Drive like 50 mph over the limit and when a cop pulls me over, just sit completely still and quiet. When he goes to his car to call for backup just climb to the back seat and lay in the floor incase he comes back and tries to reach in the driver's seat. When backup arrives, if they open the doors to search, just slowly climb out of the vehicle like nothing's going on. FUCK THE POLICE!  




 Gotta love hooch. 




 Or switch items out like Pillsbury biscuits for store brand or vice versa. Margarine for butter. 2% for whole or skim. Splenda for regular sugar. Tea for coffee. Etc. 




 I'd hold a hundred dollar bill down on the sidewalk and move it when someone reached for it. Like really far and fast. If they got it, they could keep it.  




 Yo momma so fat she walked past my tv when I started a Lord of the rings trilogy and missed all of it..... twice 




 I'm a guy and I can do that. It's all about memory. I remember numbers very well but I suck at math. 




 I have this same problem. It really brings me down because I'm as harmful as a light breeze. You can't tell them anything like "I'm harmless don't worry about me" because it only makes things worse. They'll never know you're harmless. I'm a white guy and this is tough. I couldn't imagine being a black guy built the way I am, I'm sure that'd be harder what with the way society had deemed black guys as bad news.

 Drinking rum does it for me. 




 It may not interest you, but my wife carries a diaper bag that doesn't look like a diaper bag. We don't have any kids. Lis of pockets of various sizes. She loves it. 




 I have three brothers. In order of males, it's me, Chris , Paul, then Brian. As the oldest male, I always expected certain things. Like I figured when the time came, my dad would teach me to drive a car with a manual transmission, but no he only taught Chris. There have been other things in life such as this which have caused me to resent Chris but this one caused me the most because it's one of those father son bonding things. I'm also named after my father which one might think there'd be a stronger connection with father and son, but no. So in response to the original question, driving a manual transmission personal vehicle. 




 I just want cellphone signal bars with a triangle next to them. (Roaming symbol) and the words "the after life".  




 Shoplifting and torrenting. I've got about 20TBs of torrented data most of which I seeded to a 20+ seed ratio (good guy torrenter). I have about $1800 in merchandise from various stores in my house. Things included are countertop appliances, such as juicers, electric skillet, steamer, etc. Blu-ray player, a stack of Blu-ray discs and dvds. 20 1 TB  hdd. I'll stop right here. Let it be known I've stopped and don't plan on continuing the shoplifting. It's boring. 




 Go to sonic drive in. Order the bacon double cheese burger (number 3 here) add bbq sauce chilli and slaw. I order without mayo because I don't like mayo. This burger is the messiest burger I've ever sunk my teeth into and so very tasty. I'm slobbering on my pillow thinking about it. 




 This entire town. Fuck the not hiring my broke ass. Fuck their not having a movie theater, or decent mall. Fuck off Cleveland, MS. Fuck off Bolivar county. Fuck off 38732.  




 Raviolis and a nap. (Not exactly healthy but....) I'm Starvin'! Anyone? 




 A Pok'edex for people.(I can't do the accented "e" on my phone's keyboard). 




 To a fat trainee: "a few less donuts and a few more laps and your tubby ass wouldn't be running in the back of formation, would you Grimace?" The DS called the fat trainee Grimace like the purple thing on the old school McDonald's commercials. 




 When people blow their noses or similar things at a restaurant instead of going to the restroom. It makes me cringe. 




 A thousand upvotes to you.
