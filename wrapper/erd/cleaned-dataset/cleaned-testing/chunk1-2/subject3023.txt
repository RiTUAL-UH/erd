 As well, once you get a bit of gunpowder, you can duplicate it via Alchemic Chemistry with blood, or hand in the repeatable quest "Covered in Ash" 




 Yup. ME^3 's gonna win. GG, m8. 




 Running Red is about being dead. 




 And really, m8? Parcel gets a flair, and I don't?

I see how it is .

:P 




 I'm in Party Mode

 And yes, these are HQM maps. 




 What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? 




 Says the person who loved it prior to being banned. 




 Why is your name VikeStep? 




 It's all good! \o/ 




 m8, not trying to be rude or anything. Your explanation was very good, I was just pointing out some stuff you missed. No need to yell at me 




 I also think the story deserves some focus, as much of it revolves around it. The player is dead, and has to cope with being dead. It takes place between life and whatever happens after. Very light and cheery, right? 














 :O
There's a mods section on the MC wiki? :OOOOOOOOO

 \o/ Amazing!
Suggestion: I don't know if you've done this, but you are able to disable Mystcraft Instability per-age. There's an in-game command to do it. 




 First, put a Fluid Transition Plane next to the lava to soak up the liquids, like Cypher said.
Then, if you want, you can have the AE network output a certain signal when it's grabbed enough Lava. Have it output to the Master Ritual Stone, and bam! It will only consume a certain amount of lava before turning the ritual off. 









 You're amazing at everything, it appears :P 




 Yes, I'll get that out in a few updates. It has the compass texture because I can't texture :P
I've gotten permission to use other textures in an upcoming update, so don't worry! :D 




 Yeah I waited until I had a Igneus Extruder going to make Compressed Cobblestone for my farm 




 I'm doing Blood Magic/Botania, probs Mekanism/Thermal Expansion. Also the big "everything centered around Blood Magic" one, AKA Running Red. 









 Personally, I prefer to play Demoman.

This video shows off the new gamemode I created. All it is is a simple config file that the server downloads, and executes, allowing for anyone connected to play in a Zombie Apocalypse, without any download required by the client.

From "About.txt":
"The game is a four player co-op match where you attempt to complete the original objective of the map. In Upward, you push the cart, in Process, you capture the 3 control points, in King, you try to capture the control point and survive for 3 minutes. Unfortunately, in Apocalypse Rising, the players are hindered by zombies. These zombies spawn in groups of 6, every 20 seconds. Not only that, but each player only has one life per match, adding to the overall difficulty. [There are 3 maps that have support included in this, Upward, Kong King, and Process, all of which represent a different difficulty. Included in the readme file are instructions for adding compatibility to new maps.]

Apocalypse Rising was created in order to give clients a fun, easy way to play TF2 as a zombie game. The policy I had when making this was that I wanted there to be absolutely no download on the client's end, and that policy has held up until the end.

I'll take a moment here to say that Apocalypse Rising is completely open source, just read the configs to see what's happening, and feel free to change or add stuff to it.. Maybe I'll even make a video on that."

Thank you for looking at this. -Gideon Seymour 
























 Immediately after the announcement, I tried to feel sad that I didn't win. And I tried. But I couldn't feel sad. There was no reason to (aside from the lack of communication between the hosts and participants). I would have made Running Red anyway, I'd had the idea for a while, but this competition just gave me a reason not to procrastinate. It wasn't about winning. It was about making a good pack. And I feel I have done that. I've made a pack that sends a message, and is unique, which is something that rarely happens these days. I've accomplished my goal, and gone far above it. Running Red got listed, which is something I've only dreamed of. @PurpleMentat , who has always been one of my favorite Youtubers, did a series on my pack. Plus, I tied what is currently the most popular modpack. I consider that to be a huge achievement. I'm happy to have been part of this competition. It wasn't about winning. It was about sending a message. And you know what, I accomplished my goal.

Thank you for all that you've done, and congratulations to Parcel. 




 It (once I finish the story) will have a great impact if you choose to kill the cows and chickens. 




 I'll look into that 




 Forge version 1217 




 The biggest similarity is that is uses HQM.
Public Pack Code. 




 Sometime in the next 72 hours, and playing the first will not affect the second. Completely different experiences. 




 Yes. 




 The pack team hasn't put it on the launcher quite yet. There's a download available here:

Amazing. 




 I had this dream that the results were leaked to Panda and then we grilled him for information. He didn't say anything, and then the results were released.

You won, because you had a Mini-Me of Slowpoke101. Slowpoke said in the dream post that there was no other reason.

It was the worst nightmare ever. 




 You wish. 




 It's LOL. Apparantly it originated on 4chan. I blame ThatOneSlowking for it. 




 top kek 




 top kek. 




 I like parties. 




 You need slabs on all the sides, and then you can water them with a Watering Can to speed up the growth drastically. 




 I make Running Red. I just want to be First ^ ^
