 During my broke days in college, I tried duplicating this, buying Eggo Waffles and KFC.  It satisfied the craving, but I doubt I'd ever do it again.  




 Damn I miss Josh Morgan 




 Depends on your tone and your approach.  I read your sentence in 2 voices.  Creepy gay stalker voice, and regular voice.  That being said, it's a compliment, but the creepy voice can easily jar anyone.   




 Came here to add the same thought.  Japanese love KFC, but they make it sound like it's the norm for Xmas.  A few weeks there was a similar website where they listed breakfast from all over the world.  They put tofu as a breakfast item for Japanese.  Not even clos 




 I can't say with confidence that Alex is good enough to take us all the way.  Same can be said that if we find ourselves in a shootout where we have to air it out, I'm not confident of resting the game on Alex's arm.  Of course the O-line needs to improve as well, but if there is a free agent QB that's available I'd like to see us pick him up.  The playbook is only 1/2 open, let's go full playbook and see what happens.   




 Congratulations, enjoy!   




 The power of Reddit, helping hemophiliacs one day at a time.  Update:  I since have spoken to our fellow bleeder, and am trying to get him hooked up with Baxter.  Baxter was actually in our office the other day and this story was brought to their attention.  They're trying to take action immediately.  Btw, were you at Chicago for the Annual Meeting back in Nov?   




 Grades might not be the best motivator for learning, but as a whole we've taken out the concept of competition + challenge.  Now this might be due to the fact I grew up in a Asian house hold where grades were the end all be all.  But I notice these days, we coddle our children too much where there are no losers.  Watch this piece on 60 min about "Millenials"  and you'll see the result happening.  (http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/08/60minutes/main3475200.shtml)

The motivation has to come from parents, but grades can be a motivational booster.  Who doesn't want to score the least amongst your friends in class?  It's competition, something we've abandoned and have now let kids feel entitled.

 Here's my St. Patty's Day tradition.  Pick up a 4 pack of Guinness.  Pour 2 cans, (1 is not enough) along with the other herbs, and such.  Add only a bit of water, you want the Guinness to reduce.  Simmer for 3-4 hours till tender.  

As for the cabbage part, I like doing with a modern twist.  Slice cabbage and saute in olive oil, S+P.  Meanwhile reduce some balsamic vinegar til reduces and becomes a syrup.  Drizzle balsamic over cabbage, drink the other 2 Guinness and begin bar hopping.

 And Seattle beat the Ravens also 




 You're question is 2 part.  #1, 49ers are contenders.  Week in and week out we play competitively, enough to make the game close.  

Which leads to #2.  Alex Smith IS not the 49ers.  He's not greatest, we put him in situations that'll help us win.  Call it what you want, he manages the games and he makes enough plays.  But our Defense is legit, enough to be considered a contender.  Our special teams is elite, and our Run Offense is one of the best.  All those make the 49ers contenders.  If you don't agree then you're watching another type of football.  

Stop trolling.

 McDonald's Worker holding a metal rod 




 I was at The Venitian in Las Vegas for a bachelor party.  A bunch of us were partying in the room with strippers, booze, drugs.  
The strippers weren't the hottest, and their attitude really sucked.  They were demanding $$$ for bullshit, for instance 50.00 per dance, 100.00 for their clothes off.  We got sick of them quick and kicked them out.  That pissed them off because a few minutes later, security knocked on the door.  They forced their way in, and raided the place.  5 ginourmous guards stormed in shouting at us demanding to show us where to drugs were.  Luckily we flushed the coke, but couldn't hide the weed.  
They found the OZ of weed, took all our pics with us holding our drivers license, and that's why I can never step foot in the Venitian again.

To this day, I still swear by it.  People have hooked me up, I've hooked them up.  This guy sounds like he's keeping tabs on everything.  If he's keeping tabs on silly things such as trees, imagine if you're in a situation where he's really got you.  No need for people such as him in your life.

 My thoughts are very raw on this matter.  Just a few weeks ago, the whole city commemorated 9/11, by remembering the brave fireman, cops, citizens etc.  There was a feeling of peace, respect, and more importantly UNITY.  The whole world watched as we mourned and came together as a city.   
Fast forward to Occupy Wall Street, and it's like we took a 180 degree turn.  Now don't get me wrong, I am in full support of the protests, and hope their voice is heard globally.  And yes, the COPS fucked up on this.     
Having lived in NYC for 2 years now, I've concluded NYPD is a bunch of assholes, and there is almost a sort of pedestal these guys expect to be on after 9/11.  Now after this last incident, they're rep is back to being shit, and there's a feeling of "Us vs Them"  
As a society, when 9/11 comes around again next year do we all have pity and bow our heads to pay respects to Cops?  This ass backwards behavior US has is least surprising IMO.  And once again the whole world watches as we collide and crash against each other, making us look juvenile and incapable of handling crisis.

 Not literally...

Usually my approach has been direct, sometimes too much. The way I see it, if the girl bites then game one. There are times it gives off the relationship vibe too early, which has come back to bite me in the ass. How do I change this up so I can still appear interested without giving away too much? The backstory to this was that I met a amazing girl that just got out of a relationship. I tried taking the slow route, but it ended up backfiring. And I knew she was into me.

She's turning 28 next month, I'm 33. I'm pretty blunt usually, sometimes too straight forward. It kinda got awkward with the last girl, but at least it cuts the BS. I also wear my emotions on my sleeve, good or bad.

The backstory to this was that I met a amazing girl that just got out of a relationship.  I tried taking the slow route, but it ended up backfiring.  And I knew she was into me.   




 **Backstory**I met a awesome girl recently at a friends house. The only kicker was that her and her bf just broke up recently. I was getting the vibe the whole time we hung out, so I thought. A few weeks ago I got enough brave juice in me to ask her out, she said yes and the following weekend we hung out the whole time.

Knowing she's still fresh out, I acted my best and did not push at all. Ironically, this back fired as she made the move on me. We hooked up, things were great. I thought it was a amazing weekend, shared stories, similar upbringings, partied, laughed..everything.

So then a few weeks pass by, we talk on the phone briefly, was kinda awkward but didnt' think much. Then 2 days ago she asked me out, only to bail on me later. Today I get email saying she only wants to be friends. So with the info at hand, was I the "getting over my ex" booty call?

The only thing I can think of is that I might've given off more a relationship vibe than anything else. I did make her a mix cd, and a short story I wrote. I figured it was a worthy gamble. Also all this happened in NYC, a city unlike any other, where dating can be absolutely amazing or fucked. Often times in 1 week!
TL;DR Met a amazing girl that just broke up with her bf, I hook up with her although I didn't make the first move. Developed feelings, now she wants to be friends.   



















 A few weeks ago I met someone amazing (the white rhino), you know the kind where you can't stop thinking of them, that rare beauty you run into once every few years.  
We've hung out a few times, nothing serious, but I've been getting the good vibe overall.  She even informed me things weren't going well with her bf, and sounded as though things were going to end. (I didnt even ask her) Last time she even said, "I probably won't be talking to him" 
So last nite I finally summoned up the courage to ask her out. Although it didn't come out the smoothest, I still put it out there.  She responded, "I'm still with him..trying to work things out."  I asked how that was going, and all she said was "it's going"...Of course I tried to play it cool, and told her to let me know if anything changes.  
My question fellow Redditors.  I can handle the rejection, but was I missing some huge sign that I wasn't aware of.  Was this a flat out no, or do I still have a shot in the long term?  

 




 The backstory:  I recently met someone pretty amazing, we've hung out a few times so far, and my gut is telling me she likes me.  We went out last night, got pretty buzzed, danced alot.  I went home and ended up drunk texting her.  Nothing insane was written, but I did say I want to hear her story over dinner sometime.  I woke up today realizing what I did, immediately regretting it.  Sorta chickened out I feel like.  I feel like I might've killed any momentum, and she hasn't texted back a reply.

 The backstory:  A good friend of mine passed away in Dec due to cardiac arrest, he had pulmonary hypertension.  (33 y.o)  Three years ago, he met the love of his life, until the dumb whore went to Costa Rica and cheated on him.  The bitch got pregnant as well.  When she came back, she moved out of his apt and out of his life.  Fast forward today:  My friend's facebook page is still up and running, (his parents decided to keep it) people like to leave messages, posts, pics etc.  

Out of nowhere, this girl comes out of the woodworks and starts posting.  Everyday it's something, "I miss your touch, smile..."  Yada yada yada...Attention starving whore

Bottom line it's pissing me off now.  Only a few of us knew she cheated on him, everyone else thinks she's some sweet gal.  Out of respect for his FB page, I'm not going to bust her out.  But I can send her a message.  I need input on this.  Call me out if I'm accused of being a troll.  

TL;DR:  A girl who cheated on my friend who passed away is leaving annoying Facebook posts on his page.  I can see thru her B.S.  What should I do?   




 Last nite I began to feel the onset of a cold.  Nothing serious.  Went out for drinks which consisted of Jameson shots, 2 Stellas, and Henneseey with Ginger Ale.  Fast forward today, I feel fine.  I've done this a few times and it works.  My theory is, either I piss out everything, or the internal body temperature kills whatever strain it was.

 I work in a typical office, cubicle style.  The last 2 days the girl next to me has been hackin 24-7, to the point where it's annoying to hear, and it's kinda nasty.  By no means am I a germaphobe, I'm just trying not to get sick.  Is it wrong to go up and ask/tell her to go home?  What's your stance on this?  BTW, the excuse of I don't want to use PTO/or Sick days is BS.

 If you choose not to attend the wedding, don't tell the fiance either.  My reasoning, is that you're choosing to cut him out of your life completely.  You're acknowledging that he is not your brother.  However by informing the fiance, you're now taking a step back into his life.  Furthermore you're potentially opening up old wounds.  

If you're going to tell the fiance, send a letter, no return address so they don't know who it's from.  At least this way you're not getting caught up in the BS 




 If you're looking for re sale value, I wouldn't go with the studio.  Most young professionals come to NY for X number of years, and by the time they're wanting to settle down a studio is not what they have in mind.  If you can, go with a 1BR.

 Exactly this.  I'd like to know the backstory to this.  Was there hardcore texts being passed back n forth?  Were they drunk as hell?  It was their first time hooking up, and they went dominant rough right from the start.  That's an open invitation right there.  I'm not saying what the guy did was right, but there's many variables that come into play here.   




 What kind of messages were said back and forth leading up to this?    Clearly this guy took it overboard and violated you, but if you showed signs of wanting to be dominated and taken, this goes both ways.  This was your first time hooking up, you're gonna be going 100 m.p.h with excitement and such.

You've got to pony up a little bit and think what drove this guy to lose it.  Was there booze involved, how many texts back and forth were there, nature of conversation, etc.  Cops are gonna be all over this asking you how you even allowed him to enter your house and hook up?  As much as you are the victim here, when the cops question you and the incident, you need to make sure everything adds up.  There is a huge grey area when it comes to this unfortunately.

 Japanese fella here.  Although the dad is clearly being abusive, it's sorta common for the men to just yell at their wives.  It's Old School mentality.  Is it right?  Absolutely not, but the mom doesn't have alot of options. It's not like here in the states where there's support groups, organizations etc.  Sadly, psycho social support in Japan is not on top of the list.  

And unless there is complete followthru, I actually disagree and she shouldn't inform the organization.  She's only staying for a year or two tops, it's a different dynamic she's witnessing than if she were there for 5 years.

 Playin hoop after a bowl is one of the best.  I think i was 17-20 once in a 3 pt contest.  In the zone no doubt!   




 That I like to smoke weed.   




 Ed Hardy shirts.  




 How many people come to the park on drugs?  Artist buddies of mine used to like going to the park on acid and then do sketches while they tripped.  Some of it was fantastic, others not so  




 Pretty much yeah 




 In this order.  

1. Make love to my wife
2. Smoke a blunt with my best friends
3. Drink 3 Belgian Ales
4. Dance my ass off  




 Do we draft a big WR?  I'd like to see us get a jump ball type, ala AJ Green, Plax type size.   




 I think it's partly due to self-reflection and realization of who they are while they are in the relationship.  Once they're out, there's a plan set in motion and you go forth.  I know because I did the same 




 Chef friend of mind in CA recently got married.  During his break, the dishwashers asked him when he's gonna have kids.  He said he was gonna wait until he had a little more money on hand and be responsible.  The dishwashers response, "Have as many as you want, the government will pay for it!"   




 Not sure how much football you've watched or understand, but it takes all 11 players to do their job in order for the play to happen.  Not the 3 out of 11 being a meat shield.  

And from a different perspective, when a play goes right, whether it's a 60 yd run TD, or a 45 yd pass, sometimes it's [poetry in motion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1SFA2UDOc feature=related)

 Red Montana throwback.  It's the only jersey I have.   




 All orifices filled with black dildos?  Check!
 




 Yeah man, "curiously"  is a great way to describe her.  The more and more I watch I get attracted.   




 Any NY'ers gonna be watching the game in Manhattan?  I tried Finnerty's last Sat, was absolutely too crowded.  Any other Niner bars you guys know of?   




 On my wedding, Dec 1, 2011. 




 Does [pruno](http://blacktable.com/gillin030901.htm) exist in jails?   




 Chinese duck, big bowl of rice, and some bok choy.  Could easily be one of my last meals  




 Not sure if it's the worst, but the typical douche's we call Chad's n Brad's 




 Cheers 




 I thought Cielo had the best sound system, but the Jersey Shore crowd makes it unbearable.  Wed nights are awesome however since its usually free till 11, and room to dance.   




 I slipped a hostess cupcake on the seat of this kid while he wasn't looking.  Of course afterwards it looked like shit stains combined with cum, and for the rest of the day he had to walk around with that stain.  I know, I'm a jerk 




 My friend was hiring at a bank, asked for the applicant's email address.  Her response, "littlelatinkitty@yahoo"  There should be a askreddit for worst email address 




 It's more of a shock the Nature Valley bar is totally intact.

 I don't know your family background, but just be prepared that your family will not change.  Issues like this are ingrained in some folks.  Ultimately, this decision will come down to you, whether you want to stay beside him or find someone else to make your folks happy.  It's a shitty situation to be in, I hope there will be a good ending to this.   




 Ever had Chinese fried chicken?  Their secret is cornstarch  




 More of an observation than a stereo type, but I see self entitlement as a common factor especially amongst white men.  That and no rhythm
 




 Have her contact their corporate office.  I smell a great PR response/campaign from this.  Unacceptable

 Game=charm.  Charm has been around for centuries.  Game is modern day charm.   




 New to Reddit? 




 I quit time warner last yr.  For my sports fix I use firstrowsports.com.

 Grab hold of destiny, make it happen.  There's no reason not to be alone tnt 




 Yes esp if its a white collared shirt  




 Live thru them, keep them in your thoughts, and remind yourself how blessed you are that they were in your lives.  I've lost a good deal of friends, what puts me at ease is knowing they played an integral part in my life and that I am who I am because of them   




 Been saying this for awhile too.  These days Kanye should only stick to producing, his flow is getting very 1 dimensional, nursery rhyme style.   




 My coworker in the cubicle next to me constantly clears her throat.  Now I know it's a habit, and she's not doing it to piss me off.  But that sound has been embedded in my brain to the point where anytime somebody clears their throat constantly it gets annoying.   




 I'd go rock, paper, scissors.  I believe in Nirvana, so it's a win/win either way.  I too like to live dangerously.

 Dude you're 20, it's perfectly normal to be single.  You're still in discovery phase, learning about yourself and the world out there.  The fact you're posting this question asking for input says alot.  This stuff will click together, but not overnight, or with 1 chick.   




 My first guess is this has to be a summer camp skit 




 I'm simply calling you out on your "I'm from Texas" statement.  Your references of beef, eggs, and music are all 1 dimensional.  If Texas was even remotely as diverse as SF, I wouldn't even trip.  
 
For example, what's Texas eggs? Drenched in oil, butter, add tons bacon, potatoes.  I don't have an issue if you don't like Japanese eggs, but again I wouldn't bet the house on anything culinary from Texas.  Who is your famous chef?  Tim Love, cmon now.    

Texas Music, first that comes to mind, twangy whack ass country music.  Again how many dimensons?  I can say legitimately that SF is diverse and we can back up our arguments across the board from music to food.  And yes I'm also Japanese so I do know the culture and the gentle complex flavors that are associated with our food.  

Finally fuck the Cowboys!  




 Your explanation was invalid the moment you said you're from Texas
