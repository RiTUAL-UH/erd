 Easily one of the most frustrating things about a relationship 




 I got a lot of weird looks when I busted out laughing in the middle of the laundromat. . 




 I work in at a dueling piano bar and I usually miss everything that happens there. But on this night I got to see two sets of tits. One from a girl who wanted free drinks from me (she didn't get it this isn't r/gonewild ) and the other because some dude convinced her that it was a good idea to show the bartenders her boobs before they take a shot as some sort of "good luck" act. Either both were nice and made my night!

 I rarely remember my dreams but sometimes they are extremely vivid, sometimes not so vivid. I'm curious as to why that is.

 As an architecture major,  I thank you for making my life easier in the future 




 I hate you for this.. it's not fair! 




 This gif is so full of hate

 It was from last night's game, I was yelling too..at the tv though because I had to work afterwards 




 What's clunky? 




 I'm not saying this is physically or feasibly possibly but, it is a great concept. An open source phone with interchangeable parts, like a desktop computer, sounds like a dream. 









 Usually Local has it on
