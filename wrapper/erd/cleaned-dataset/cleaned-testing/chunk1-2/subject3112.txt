 "Sorry dad, my fucking dumbass friend changed the url when I got up to use the bathroom"

Come on OP 




 Hi!  I have several pets on side accounts that I want to show off on my main account userlookup, but I'd like a lookup that was possibly kind of designed with this in mind?  Anybody know of any? 




 If you feed a pet at movie central when it is bloated:

You will get the 'very bloated' status.  That should make it easier to get leftovers, or so I've heard. 




 Nice zap!  I'm working on zapping a poogle MSP on TWO accounts and it's not going so well  x_x  pray neoluck for me as well! 
























 I regret isolating myself from my peers, and not even taking any part in extracurriculars.  Most of the time, I literally went to school and went home to get on the internet, and stayed in my room.

Originally, I was very socially awkward due mostly because of my terrible home life, but was still very sociable.  Just annoying, though.  7th grade was a terrible year, it was my first year at the junior high, and I was quickly learning how cruel other kids could be.  I mean I was annoying, I deserved some of the hate I got, but there were some things that happened that were practically unwarranted.  It was around that time that I moved to my grandparent's house to get away from my homelife abuse, and it just came to me that I was tired of other people.  So very, very tired.  My self esteem was in the pits.  I was tired of being the subject of ridicule, of being a psychological punching bag of my peers and family.  And I knew it had to do with the fact that I was hopeless at social interaction.  

I don't know what happened, but it was like some part of my brain just... slowed to a stop when I realized just how shitty everything was.  Some part of me broke, I think.  I stopped interacting with my peers mostly.  I spent a lot of time studying.  I pretty much only spoke when I had something witty to say.  Soon... people started liking me.  My only friend year later told me that someone from one of my classes told her, "test_subject3112 used to be really weird, but she's cool now".  That's right, I was cool because I wasn't an annoying shit anymore and just shut up.  Because of my bad self esteem, this pretty much only reinforced my behavior.

While I did learn a great amount of patience from my actions, it is terribly regrettable.  I developed severe social anxiety because I have worried so much about making myself presentable to others.  I kept silent, I figured shutting up and being obedient and staying out of others way was the best and easiest way to coast through school.  Now it is difficult to be employed, to leave my house, to make friends.  I am anxious much of the time.  I quit my last job due to a panic attack.  Apathy has encroached on every aspect of my life.  My therapist actually told me my depression is worse than my anxiety.

At the time this all started, I could hardly cope with the stress.  I'm thinking it is probably a combination of school and home pressure that caused me to break and retreat within myself.  I greatly fear rejection.  People tell me not to care about what others think, but I have realized from so many years of being alone that people are a part of our lives whether we want them there or not. 




 *cringe* I checked on the pandora website and the minimum price is like 20-25 dollars per charm...  My grandma got me one of these bracelets with only four charms, so the minimum she would have had to pay would be at least over $100, right?  Now I feel like absolute shit because I literally never wear it.  ):  




 Perhaps some money in there as well in case of emergency?  It doesn't have to be much, but I've heard it's always good to have some money outside of your wallet stashed somewhere just in case. 




 Wait there's a neo group on facebook?  Can't you report that person to the group mod for scamming and get them removed?
