 There will be no collapse.  AT least not in the way you imagine it.  It's not going to be like "Dawn of the Dead" where suddenly chaos erupts everywhere, and the preppers grab their bugout bags and go in the woods.  The ongoing zeitgeist that one day lightning will strike and the proles will rise up is another method of control.  It's far more insidious than that.  Read "The Hollow Men" by TS Eliot and you'll understand.

You'll just notice that every day things will become a little more expensive.  Prices will go up and down, but this constant will always remain: you will need to work longer for less and less.  Young people finishing college will be told at their graduation that "The only way to the top is to start at the bottom," only to see the bottom get lower and lower every year.  Job security will cease to exist as a concept.  YOu'll notice the size of houses and apartments will begin to shrink whilst the price of housing rises.  More and more it will become challenging to find food that doesn't taste rather bland.  You'll see your friends and family less, and one day find that doesn't bother you much.  Marriage will become rare, as will children.  People will begin to indulge themselves in digital fantasies, never actually experiencing the real world.  The modern human will have no religion.  No dreams.  No desires or wants beyond the immediate sating of his bodily desires.  No beliefs beyond the arithmetic (and even that will become a grey area).  One day, still many generations from now, your descendant will walk into a voting booth, and there will be a single choice for him to checK: "Yes."  And every day he will be told from the moment he wakes up to the moment he sleeps, "You are stupid, you are ugly, you are weak.  But together we are free, prosperous, and strong."

That is the true nature of the collapse: the reduction of the modern American man to a feudal serf, incapable of feeling love or hate, and unable to recognize his own self-worth.

 Has this been in planning since Obama was elected?  Just recently there has been a huge political push to overthrow the United States government by its own members, and high ranking members of other nations. Obama has "failed" the military industrial complex by recalling troops from the Middle East and by not sending in troops during the "Syria chemical weapons" debacle, and Obama has "failed" Israel by not being more firm with Iran. Saudi Arabia is at risk of being exposed as a direct financial supporter of the 9/11 attacks, and Rand Paul had a speech about how Saudi Arabia is no longer an ally of the United States.

Netanyahu has been working directly with members of the US congress in an effort to overthrow Obama. 
http://nypost.com/2015/02/18/bibi-why-im-speaking-to-congress/

"Why am I going to Washington? Because, as prime minister of Israel, its my obligation to do everything in my power to prevent the conclusion of a bad deal that could threaten the survival of the State of Israel. "

This means that Netanyahu doesn't believe Obama is working in the best interest of Israel, so he's working directly with members of congress to ensure that something happens to change that fact.

Rudy Giuliani, who was in on the 9/11 attacks, has directly attacked Obama

Rudy Giuliani: Obama doesn't love America

Giuliani, a lapdog, has been making a big scene about Obama. Conservatives love Giuliani and believe everything he says. 

Giuliani states that Obama was influenced by Communists
http://nypost.com/2015/02/21/giuliani-obama-influenced-by-communists-since-youth/

Rudy Giuliani doubled down on his claims that President Obama doesnt love America in an interview with The Post Friday  claiming the commander-in-chief has been influenced by communists since his youth.

DHS intelligence report warns of domestic right-wing terror threat 
http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/19/politics/terror-threat-homeland-security/

They're carrying out sporadic terror attacks on police, have threatened attacks on government buildings and reject government authority.

The DHS was given unlimited power after the events of 9/11. Saudi Arabia has been linked with al-Qaida and the American public wants the "missing" 28 pages of the 9/11 commission reports to be declassified. Netanyahu has stated that 9/11 was very beneficial to Israel. These entities are trying to overthrow Obama and take control of America. Expect a false flag attack in the coming weeks, if not sooner. Afterwards the DHS will launch their plan to incarcerate any that oppose the coup.

 Maybe.  We still don't have her story.  




 What evidence do you have that the son will live a better life in China? 




 They will, eventually.  She won't be able to stay long. 




 She's not a Chinese citizen.  She was born there, but is now a US citizen.  She can't legally stay in China much longer. 




 Massachusetts will give you $2,500 cash back if you buy an electric 




 My son does a lot of small business with companies in Dalian.  He says many people speak English there and it wouldn't be too hard to find this woman

AMHERST  The University of Massachusetts Amherst is in discussions with the Dalai Lama to have him speak at the university this fall.

Nancy Buffone, the universitys executive director of external relations and university events, said the university was in planning mode.

Were expecting a visit in the fall, thats all I can say right now, Buffone said Thursday. Were in very intense planning.

The details of his appearance at UMass are still being worked out.

The Dalai Lama, Tibetans exiled spiritual leader, last came to the region on May 9, 2007, to speak at Smith College and receive an honorary doctorate from that institution.

He was welcomed that day by both Hampshire and Smith colleges. The Five Colleges run an exchange program with the Tibetan universities in exile in India. The Dalai Lama also spoke privately with members of the Tibetan Association of Western Massachusetts.

With a good education, facilities and warm-heartedness, a person becomes fuller and, I think, better equipped to face problems, he said to a group of thousands at Smith. Education gives us guidance, and warm-heartedness gives us the proper use of all our knowledge.

Constance Kassor, a lecturer in the religion department at Smith and the current director of the Five College Tibetan Studies in India exchange program, said she is pleased the Dalai Lama will likely return to the Valley.

Its a really exciting opportunity, especially for our students, Kassor said Thursday.

Some students who have participated in the exchange program have gotten to meet the Dalai Lama and have a private audience with him, Kassor said.

Anna Lee White, a senior at Mount Holyoke College, participated in the program in January 2013. During her stay in northern India, the Dalai Lama visited the university for a week to give public teachings, she said.

It was incredible to attend these teachings along with thousands of Tibetans, White wrote in an email to the Gazette.

During her groups private meeting with the Dalai Lama, White remembers how many groups were waiting to see him, but how calm, friendly and curious he was with everyone he spoke with.

The group before them were all blind Indian children, and he gave each of them a hug before saying goodbye, White wrote.

I remember him telling all of us that he hopes that someday we would have the chance to travel to Tibet and continue learning about Buddhism and see what it is like there ourselves, she wrote.

The experience led her to return to India the following year for a semester and she will be studying Hindi in India next year after graduating in May.

She will miss the Dalai Lamas visit, but hopes to hear about it from her sister, who attends Amherst College, she said.

Elena Read, a senior at Smith, also participated in the exchange program in 2013.

She said the Dalai Lamas teaching sessions stuck with her more than the private visit with him.

Much of the teaching focused on death, and living with the awareness that one day each person will die, she said.

The only certainty in life is that it comes to an end, Read said. And so to kind of not waste time, I think that stuck with me pretty strongly.

Tibetans believe that the Dalai Lama is the reincarnated being of the Buddhist patron saint of Tibet, known as the Bodhisattva of Compassion, according to the Dalai Lamas website. Bodhisattvas are beings who have chosen to become reincarnated rather than achieve nirvana so that they can serve humanity, according to the website.

Born on July 6, 1935, in northeastern Tibet, the Dalai Lama began education as a Buddhist monk at age 6.

In 1950, the Dalai Lama was called upon to lead Tibet in the face of a Chinese invasion. He went to Beijing for peace talks with Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders 1954, but was forced into exile in 1959 and has lived in Dharamsala in northern India ever since.

The Dalai Lama has spoken to the United Nations and governments of the United States and Europe, seeking for Tibet the status of an independent nation and a place of peace. He has advocated for non-violence.

He has traveled to nearly 70 countries on six continents and received more than 150 awards including, in 1989, the Nobel Peace Prize. He has also written or co-written more than 100 books.

While the Dalai Lama continues to be the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people, he is no longer the political leader, having transferred that authority to a democratically elected leader in 2011.

 That guy was pretty lame.  Remember each speaker is invited by the voters of that graduating class, speaks to the quality of the class vote 














 of course this is how it starts.  Look up James Corbett's "How to fake an Alien Invasion" 









 It pisses me off when my grandson's teacher talks about her church in class, but there's really nothing I can do about it.  As long as she's not preaching or praying, that is. 




 For about 15 years, my wife and I donated $500 to the western Mass food bank, so whenever I would see homeless people on the street, I'd convince myself that I'd already done my part.  While I still think donating to the food bank is a good thing, I've changed my thoughts on what to do when I encounter someone on the street.  I now give them whatever cash and loose change I have in my pockets.  Sometimes it's only a couple bucks, sometimes it's a few hundred.  I'm always going to be better off than them, so why not share what I have?  Honestly I don't care where the money goes, and I'm done with judging people on the choices they've made in their lives. 




 I work in an ER.  We see a few of these "cases" a couple times a year.  All of the patients have a history of heroin use. 









 Unfortunately, it's not.  I can't post there 




 OP how do you have so much time to devote to posts like this?  I mean, who the FUCK CARES? 




 Fuckers should donate that money to their own people north of the border.  Fucking koreans 




 Yeah Weebly is great.  Wicked easy to use also has great mobile 









 Dahboo is a moron.  Fuck daboo 




 There's always Fark.com 




 obviously the one with the demon face 




 The mods of course. 

But that's ok because we have /r/Bad_cop_no_donut  









 Didn't Paul play football in college?  That may explain the obvious brain trauma and memory loss  














 I like it "unspecified New England town"  




 Staples on Rte 9 in Amherst will do it for you.  Email them to the copy center through their website, or call and get the email from their copy center.  Then you can pick up at your leisure. 














 Oh sure, I get that, totally!  And that's a great thing.  Scientology is clearly a scam and the movie clearly delineates that in great detail, and does it well.  It's just a shame they didn't dig deeper, into the murders and other conspiracies 









 Thanks for posting that.  I watched the first 30 minutes of it before turning it off.  As I said earlier, none of this is new.   




 I've heard it's not very good, that the book is better and that there's nothing new revealed about the church that isn't already online 




 No thanks, NSA 




 Let us know how it goes.  I'm not really interested 




 There are a lot of cool places where poetry is often part of the "scene" for example the Thirsty Mind coffee house in South Hadley 









 Well an RSS reader like Google Reader is what I'm looking for.  Something that I can share to and can be shared/discussed 




 it's an aggragator, no more no less.  You have to be able to read between the lines.  There are very few journalists/researchers I trust.  James Corbett is one of them.  His agenda seems to be fairly open, although I did wonder at the fact that he took a very long time to open up about his personal history/timeline.   









 You posted this in Northampton too right?  As I said over there, there's not much to do in Amherst except you do have the Fretted Instrument Workshop here which is pretty great.

If you're a hiker you'll want to check out the Metacomet Monadnock trail which is nearby, also the Robert Frost Trails.

Speaking of Frost, there's a museum for him at Amherst College

And if you're really into writers, how about the Emily Dickinson museum on Main St? 




 Has nothing to do with belief.   




 I've been watching episodes of "the Wire"...sheeit 




 I think the bulb show is still going on at Smith College greenhouse.  Worth checking out.

Thornes Market is fun.  We take our grandkids there.

Just walk up one side of Main St and down the other.  There're lots of cool shops to check out.  

Head over to Downtown Sounds on Pleasant St and check out the instruments for sale there.

If you're into music, Turn It Up has used CD, also on Pleasant St.  

A2Z is a hobby/toy store on King St if you have kids that's a fun place to visit. 

A couple nice galleries in Noho.

Amherst doesn't have much to see for tourists.  There are a couple book stores, but the selection isn't great.  I guess the thing I like about Amherst most is the Fretted Instrument Workshop, a great music store with guitars and mandolins and banjos.

 




 Why?  A boat on the water?  An over exposed/filtered picture of trees and water?  I'm confused. 




 Nor can you, Mr Panetta 




 The Birds, The Birds!  Like something out of a Hitchcock movie 




 she's ugly.  WTF.  Guys, you can install big tits on a tin can if you want.  It's the face that matters 




 You're talking about Meta Data, which they've been pulling for years.  Ever watch "The Wire"?

But downloading anything from Wikileaks will get you automatically flagged at the NSA and Department of Homeland Security. 




 I'm not here for numbers.  I'm here to learn something and share a little of what I've learned.  I'm here for a laugh and here for a little fun.  If I can't vote, I'm not going to waste my time on a site.  It's why I stopped going to GLP (I originally went for a laugh, that site is a joke), they started banning any IP that didn't log in.  It became a chore to go there so I stopped.  

As I said, I don't give a shit about Karma.  I just like to learn and share. 




 The VNW was publicized.  Americans saw gruesome battles on tv every evening while they ate their dinner!  The KW was a hidden "police action", largely overlooked by the MSM at the time 














 Clickbait.  If you click on it you will be tracked by the NSA and DHS. 




  Can't download it as it's bigger than a gb.  Post it somewhere so we can watch it online 




 Easy for me, but I'm older than you guys by probably about 40 years LOL 




 "Famous Dutch Band" Isn't that an oxymoron?   




 I guess I use Reddit like an RSS reader.  The only way you can hide something is by voting on it.  But I like the variety of articles on the front page.  It's still my go to site for "pNews" because it's way faster than inoreader or any other rss reader 




 Generally I say what's on my mind and don't give a fuck about comment karma (which is why you see so many -'s next to my comments here on spReddit.  I just don't give a fuck.  I used to care about that shit like 5 or 6 years ago when it really did matter.  But now?  It doesn't matter one iota 




 Democracy now has it listed on their website.  You can read it without alerting NSA there 




 Wow might as well share some fat samoans then.  They are technically asians.  How about Mexicans and Pygmies?  Same genetic code as Chinese.

Indians are not asian 




 wrong kind of asian bub 




 Warning...it's a PDF and will download automatically, notifying the NSA automatically that you're a terrorist 




 Do you remember Richard "Dick" Walton from the B school? 









 THis person is not attractive.  Stop posting 




 clipons/boltons are really ugly.  they serve literally no purpose.  I work in an ER.  Have you ever seen one of these that's been in an auto accident?  Yuk 




 I don't see it.  Honestly I don't, I'm not trying to be a troll.  Business is booming in Massachusetts 









 wow three whole people! 




 It happens all the time.  Training that is 




 What about Iraq? 














 I'm from western Massachusetts and I see airplanes go over head every day 




 OP do you know how government agencies get money for their budgets?  By spending every penny they have!  I worked for the city of Boston in the 1970s.  You could tell a government worker because they would push all of the paper, delay as long as it was legally possible and "hide" whenever they could.  Government workers take the maximum # of breaks that exist, take all of their vacation, and sick time, and know every loophole that exists to keep from helping you or doing their job!

So I'm not surprised to read your story, and I'm positive there's no conspiracy here 




 It won't affect me much as I rarely read MSM anyway 




 The biggest problem with Voat is you can't vote! (until you have 100 comment karma) 




 Fuck the popups on that site.  What the fuck.   




 OP you should know better than try to post a conspiracy thread in worldnews or news 




 Is it true that atheists must be executed in Syria?

Is there a law against atheism in Iraq? 









 I'm moving to Canada.  No I'm too old.  Shit 




 boobs and tats are a dime a dozen.  Let's see her face! 









 Manami Hashimoto 









 Doesn't her face look disproportionately small compared to the rest of her body? 




 If you're an American, you're used to seeing big boobs.  But look at those eyes!  That's what I love most about Asian models...eyes, cheekbones, etc. 




 don't be that guy! 




 Fake tits and eye surgery = White American.  Not interested 









 I don't think there's a conspiracy here...Sure it makes sense to put your rant in /r/conspiracy because there are fewer rules here than the rest of Reddit and the mods are generally great guys.  There's a shitload more "democracy" in this subreddit than the rest of the site!

But what I'm saying is, this is just one of the swings of the site...it's going way to the right now and will probably go this way for a couple more years before it swings back the other way.  I should know, I was here when it first started...I learned about it from a FARK link for chrissakes, back when Mike Arrington had just started Techcrunch as a blog...do you guys remember when there was a forum on that site?  With conversations about startups and great new social media sites.  Those were the days!

Reddit used to be this tiny FARK imitation site where you could vote, share and discuss any fucking thing you wanted without moderation, kinda like 4chan, but with a better setup.

I guess some of us are waiting for the next thing, but for right now, we got /r/conspiracy and that's good enough for most of us :) 




 Are you saying Aaron Schwartz was killed by reddit? 









 hitomi furuya 




 It's an obvious and poorly done photoshop.  If you enlarge the image and look at the arm on the left, it's distorted.

 




 Won't be the first time 




 Camera bag?  Some kind of padded equipment bag 









 As someone who actually went to Vietnam (as a medic), that's an obvious photoshop 









 I'm an atheist and an MD.  I took a minor in religion during College because I was curious.

 The Slaves That Time Forgot

John Martin
Global Research
May 29, 2012

They came as slaves; vast human cargo transported on tall British ships bound for the Americas. They were shipped by the hundreds of thousands and included men, women, and even the youngest of children.

Whenever they rebelled or even disobeyed an order, they were punished in the harshest ways. Slave owners would hang their human property by their hands and set their hands or feet on fire as one form of punishment. They were burned alive and had their heads placed on pikes in the marketplace as a warning to other captives.

We dont really need to go through all of the gory details, do we? After all, we know all too well the atrocities of the African slave trade. But, are we talking about African slavery? King James II and Charles I led a continued effort to enslave the Irish. Britains famed Oliver Cromwell furthered this practice of dehumanizing ones next door neighbor.

The Irish slave trade began when James II sold 30,000 Irish prisoners as slaves to the New World. His Proclamation of 1625 required Irish political prisoners be sent overseas and sold to English settlers in the West Indies. By the mid 1600s, the Irish were the main slaves sold to Antigua and Montserrat. At that time, 70% of the total population of Montserrat were Irish slaves.

Ireland quickly became the biggest source of human livestock for English merchants. The majority of the early slaves to the New World were actually white.

From 1641 to 1652, over 500,000 Irish were killed by the English and another 300,000 were sold as slaves. Irelands population fell from about 1,500,000 to 600,000 in one single decade. Families were ripped apart as the British did not allow Irish dads to take their wives and children with them across the Atlantic. This led to a helpless population of homeless women and children. Britains solution was to auction them off as well.

During the 1650s, over 100,000 Irish children between the ages of 10 and 14 were taken from their parents and sold as slaves in the West Indies, Virginia and New England. In this decade, 52,000 Irish (mostly women and children) were sold to Barbados and Virginia. Another 30,000 Irish men and women were also transported and sold to the highest bidder. In 1656, Cromwell ordered that 2000 Irish children be taken to Jamaica and sold as slaves to English settlers.

Many people today will avoid calling the Irish slaves what they truly were: Slaves. Theyll come up with terms like Indentured Servants to describe what occurred to the Irish. However, in most cases from the 17th and 18th centuries, Irish slaves were nothing more than human cattle.

As an example, the African slave trade was just beginning during this same period. It is well recorded that African slaves, not tainted with the stain of the hated Catholic theology and more expensive to purchase, were often treated far better than their Irish counterparts.

African slaves were very expensive during the late 1600s (50 Sterling). Irish slaves came cheap (no more than 5 Sterling). If a planter whipped or branded or beat an Irish slave to death, it was never a crime. A death was a monetary setback, but far cheaper than killing a more expensive African. The English masters quickly began breeding the Irish women for both their own personal pleasure and for greater profit. Children of slaves were themselves slaves, which increased the size of the masters free workforce. Even if an Irish woman somehow obtained her freedom, her kids would remain slaves of her master. Thus, Irish moms, even with this new found emancipation, would seldom abandon their kids and would remain in servitude.

In time, the English thought of a better way to use these women (in many cases, girls as young as 12) to increase their market share: The settlers began to breed Irish women and girls with African men to produce slaves with a distinct complexion. These new mulatto slaves brought a higher price than Irish livestock and, likewise, enabled the settlers to save money rather than purchase new African slaves. This practice of interbreeding Irish females with African men went on for several decades and was so widespread that, in 1681, legislation was passed forbidding the practice of mating Irish slave women to African slave men for the purpose of producing slaves for sale. In short, it was stopped only because it interfered with the profits of a large slave transport company.

England continued to ship tens of thousands of Irish slaves for more than a century. Records state that, after the 1798 Irish Rebellion, thousands of Irish slaves were sold to both America and Australia. There were horrible abuses of both African and Irish captives. One British ship even dumped 1,302 slaves into the Atlantic Ocean so that the crew would have plenty of food to eat.

There is little question that the Irish experienced the horrors of slavery as much (if not more in the 17th Century) as the Africans did. There is, also, very little question that those brown, tanned faces you witness in your travels to the West Indies are very likely a combination of African and Irish ancestry. In 1839, Britain finally decided on its own to end its participation in Satans highway to hell and stopped transporting slaves. While their decision did not stop pirates from doing what they desired, the new law slowly concluded THIS chapter of nightmarish Irish misery.

But, if anyone, black or white, believes that slavery was only an African experience, then theyve got it completely wrong.

Irish slavery is a subject worth remembering, not erasing from our memories.

But, where are our public (and PRIVATE) schools???? Where are the history books? Why is it so seldom discussed?

Do the memories of hundreds of thousands of Irish victims merit more than a mention from an unknown writer?

Or is their story to be one that their English pirates intended: To (unlike the African book) have the Irish story utterly and completely disappear as if it never happened.

None of the Irish victims ever made it back to their homeland to describe their ordeal. These are the lost slaves; the ones that time and biased history books conveniently forgot.

The man facing down Putin's aggression as secretary of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council is Andriy Parubiy. He oversees national security for the nation having previously served as security commandant during the anti-government protests in Kiev.

Parubiy was the founder of the Social National Party of Ukraine, a fascist party styled on Hitler's Nazis, with membership restricted to ethnic Ukrainians.

Its kind of strange, because in the last five days of the bombing and shelling, we havent seen a single militia compound that has actually been hit. Every building that weve seen been hit by the Ukrainian mortars have been civilian buildings. We personally seen at least over 40 different civilian buildings bombed, that includes a school, an orphanage  we were in an orphanage the day before yesterday that was hit  and the very many large apartment buildings, like the very big apartment buildings have been hit . Some of the apartment buildings  its not like the Ukrainian army miss-aimed or something like this  the same buildings when they are bombed, they hit them very hard. We spoke to one woman who said that in the night a few days ago her apartment building was hit with ten different mortars.
