 I was raised with very limited cooking and food health knowledge and I think this might be a good forum for myself and others. Examples of food facts can be anything food related that you think people might not know, such as: spinach has more protein per pound than steak, or to keep your egg yolk from overcooking when making over-easy eggs poke a small hole in the egg yolk once you have the egg off the pan and on your plate. 

























































































 besides the obvious (healthcare, dental, etc..) what kinds of free stuff are we getting from work? 





























 Because it's humerus. 









 So I am bipolar and just recently started up on my meds while at the same time quitting smoking cigarettes and pot. Its been about 4 months now and my dreams are becoming more and more lucid. Any tips for a new lucid dreamer? Has anyone else here had the same response to these meds? 














 Perhaps atheism is taking a subconscious hold on our youth. Think about what it stands for, you only live once. A denial of an afterlife! 


































 Layman here. I want to be more excited about this thing because I am a science fiction geek. How is this going to affect future technology?  
























 Who's with me on this one? 




 At the end of ME3 you have a chance to meld with Liara's mind in this sexy galaxy scene where she hugs your arm. I am now replaying a new career, and when speaking with Liara I find out that their species mates with any other species of any sex by exploring their mate's minds and their genetic material. Could Shepard's genetic material live on in Liara? Does anyone remember if Liara survives in the end?  









 Mine is the M-11 Wraith shotgun. Small clip size, but very powerful, accurate, lightweight, and very quick to reload.  









 Were you even playing the game? I've almost finished, making mostly a renegade campaign, and I am deeply affected by the choices I've made. I lied to the Wrex about the Genophage, wiped out the entire Quarian fleet and watched the wreckage burn like fireworks in the sky of their homeworld, mercy-killed an Ardat-Yakshi, watched Tali kill herself....all because of choices I have made (or didn't make). I would say in comparison to ME1 and 2, the choices are much deeper in ME3, more emotionally connected. I really like playing the renegade campaign, and found it pretty easy to play along in ME1 and 2, but in 3, I really can feel the emotional impact of my choices. I can't be the only one who finds this a masterpiece of space opera. 

[EDIT] I'm going to get drunk and finish the game tonight so I'll post later and tell you guys my final assessment..but so far its been pretty fun. So far I've gotten my moneys worth.  




 I suggest you buy it.  












































 [Don't kill Cicero.](/d)  





























 Buy it! 
























 Seriously...childhood would have been a lot less suckier if I was allowed some input.  




 uhhh...help? Am I doing something wrong? 









 Who would best uphold the ideals of the hive-mind?

 My roommate felt robbed after beating the game on the Wii. When I was a kid, I always thought the best part was when you made him bleed red blood , blooooody red blood at the end. Why is the Wii version green blood? Green blood stupid. 









 Nobody gives a fuck how many old cartridges you own.  



















 Three things concerning Halo and it's sequels (anyone else feel this way?) 

1. When I'm over at a friends house and the only multiplayer game they own is Halo, I instantly lose some respect for that friend.

2. When I am forced in a situation where I must play one or two minutes of Halo, it feels as if I am defying one of my base morals, and I lose a little respect for myself.

3. WTF? Another Halo? Doesn't anyone realize how much Halo sucks, and how awful it is compared to this generation's FPS (single and multiplayer) greats? 

In conclusion, HALO SUCKS BALLSAKS.  





























 Yeah because I'm sure he does this to ALL of his pumpkins, you twit 




 She was a coward who killed herself. Learn from it and move on, she no longer exists, you do. 









 How do you sleep at night knowing that your profession revolves around the carnal sins of humanity? What do you contribute to the world other than pain?  I would not be surprised if people have been driven to suicide or worse due to your meddling for profit. Shame on you,  you miserable person.

 Boob ruiners and booger-covered face jewelry. I'll pass.

 Clean the crust from your keys, crusader, for your visible dimensions of her are limited.

 I think you have deep-rooted emotional issues and need to seek help.  




 Not to worry, you don't have long. 




 You vomiting rhetoric is what made me call you a pretentious windbag in the first place. The circle is closed! Good show. 









 Hey it's been fun. I hope I make it to 77. Hopefully by that age I have my shit figured out.

 I wish my kid was disabled so people could think I'm a good father. But, sadly, my kids are perfectly healthy so I'm just a douchebag single dad. Fuck this society. 




 Nipple piercings are boob ruiners and a good sign she has an std 




 So you couldn't possibly be a pervert because you have a vagina. You just keep getting dumber. 




 Did I ask for advice?  Go away if you have nothing to contribute. 




 Dead in the face 




 Clever use of the letter 't'. The guy would have had a slightly embarrassing story to tell his grandkids, instead he offs himself. Pussy.

 Personally I feel like some of the things posted to /r/gaming that are labeled "No Spoiler" are in fact spoilers. They are not spoilers because they give away story, they are spoilers because they give away crucial gameplay elements that would have been fun to discover on my own. Now, if it was a movie, any talk about the movie before you have seen it is a spoiler because a movie is a linear thing, it goes from point A to point B and if you give up something in between that line it's a spoiler. A video game on the other hand, or any video game worth its salt, is a non-linear dynamic media that somebody interacts with. I get pleasure out of discovering things about a game, about the little nuances and side-routes. I make it a point to never read a walkthrough guide until after I have beaten the game by my own wits. For example, I saw a "Last of Us" post about how it is a survival horror game with no scare jumps. Well great, that takes away some of the suspense I might be feeling when I finally play it. Or, on a post I have made a while back I labeled as a "Minor Spoiler" because I told people the best way to kill a Cazador in New Vegas. But people complained, said that it wasn't a spoiler. But to me, it definitely was because when I found out how to do that on my own a whole new world of gameplay elements opened up to me in New Vegas. So...I leave it to you...should we modify the spoiler policy or am I just bitching to the wind?

TL;DR I think that certain things labeled "No Spoiler" are in fact spoilers because they give away gameplay elements.
