 It's not private property, it's a public highway whose administration is contracted out to a private company.

 You learned to sew and cook women? What a strange school. 




 Also: I know someone who tried a vegan diet and actually gained weight; you have to be sure you're not eating a lot of fatty foods such as nuts and avocado, or sweets. 




 They generally don't; it would give the fries an unwelcome flavor. 

But you may not know what's in the oil itself (could be part animal fat) or the processing; McDonald's used to use beef tallow on its fries, don't know if it still does.

 Midland and Odessa are towns in the middle of nowhere, and those rents are comparable to what you'd pay in Austin.

For comparison, [here's](http://amarillo.craigslist.org/search/apa?catAbb=apa query= zoomToPosting= minAsk= maxAsk= bedrooms=1 housing_type=) what rents are like in Amarillo -- about 50% lower. 




 Thank you for doing this AMA. You might like this little Christmas story.

About 10 years ago about this time of year, I was visiting my mother in New York City. In December, tree vendors drive to the city from New England and other places, each with a truck full of trees, and set up shop at curbsides all over the city, selling their trees till they run out. 

My mother has a small apartment and doesn't normally get a tree. One day I was walking past a tree seller and saw that he had taken some little branches about a foot or so long that had fallen from the larger trees, stuck each one into a piece of wood for a base, and put them next to a sign that said "Charlie Brown trees, $3." Naturally I couldn't resist, so I bought one and took it home, and my mother loved it. It stayed healthy-looking through the holidays. 

So thanks to you and your husband for this and other additions to our culture. 




 We say there's nothing between Canada and Texas except a barbed-wire fence somewhere around Kansas. North Texas (where Fort Worth is) and, especially, the Panhandle get winter weather. Not as much as PA, but some. 




 a.k.a. canola oil. It's OK for massages. 




 The main difference is cost and the feeling you got a task-specific tool. Coconut oil is as good as anything with "massage" on the label. 




 Other good massage oils, besides coconut, are sweet almond oil and (my favorite) grapeseed oil. The expensive massage oils at the store are just something mundane like almond oil with some blend of scents; it's easy to duplicate at home for a fraction of the cost.

 50 here. I figured out early on that I lack the patience for having kids, and never really felt the urge. I like that I can make decisions that affect only me -- I've made good and bad, but the bad ones only hurt myself. No regrets. These are my priorities and mine alone; if yours are different, I'm behind you 100%. I'm happy to leave the child-rearing to people who want to do it and are reasonably good at it.

 I picked up a futon from the curb a few months ago. It was white, not black, so I could easily check it for bad fluids; found none. Excellent condition including the frame. Someone in that building had been putting nice furniture out by the curb a couple of times a year, no idea why.  




 But the worst World Cup in history isn't scheduled for 2014 or 2018, it's scheduled for 2022. So it makes perfect sense to focus special attention on the people who'll get screwed that year.

 The sideways emoticon is the best part. 
























 I read in a book once about an idea for a machine that could take your brain out of your body and fit both it and your body with transceivers so you'd keep functioning as your brain communicated with your body. 

So your body is outside the glass container holding your brain, and you think, "Here I am looking at my brain. Wow." Then you realize, "Wait, shouldn't I be thinking 'Here I am with my body looking at me'?"

I think the book was by Raymond Smullyan. 




 I did that one all the time when I was a kid and had never heard of yoga; can barely do it at all now, and only for a couple of seconds.

 Some people consider that capability in the language a bug. I say it's a feature. 




 The nice thing about English is how adaptable it is. In the informal register that permeates Reddit post headlines, "AM" meaning "morning" is perfectly legit and easily understood. 




 Damn, you punctuation! 




 The irony (if that's what it is) is Jason isn't my friend's birth name; he adopted it when he wanted to make some life changes including moving to a different city. Not sure how he chose it. So I guess it doesn't matter if your "real" name isn't Jason, you're still in the spirit. 




 I love this. 




 My friend Jason always looks puzzled when I call him July-to-November.

 Not to mention, some people who like both X and Y only have the money or skill to make one costume, and if it's for X they'll still wear it to Y-Con, and more power to 'em.

 When I go to Dallas I try to have lunch or dinner at Cosmic Cafe near the arts district/downtown, it's a funky vegetarian Indian-inspired place. Good coffee. 




 I agree with the commenter above. Owning a plane means you don't spend hours in departure lounges every time you travel for business, or have to take an inefficient route through a commercial hub. When your job is basically to be in charge of billions of dollars, the time you save is more valuable than the cost of the plane. 




 The problem that this county wants to address isn't "some people are homeless," it's "some people are bad." Check out [this article in the conservative opinion magazine Commentary](http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/be-open-handed-toward-your-brothers-1/) that starts out saying we should try to improve the lot of the poor, but Step 1 is "personal moral transformation." Many people in power view prison as a tool for moral transformation -- be righteous or be punished. This is part and parcel of that worldview. 




 A lot of students work on campus, and a good number of them have probably joined the state employees union. I did when I worked there. 




 "effect" as a verb means "bring about," so privatization would actually de-effect those jobs, so to speak. (Yeah, it's a stretch, but I can never resist a bad wordplay.)

[Obligatory relevant xkcd.](http://xkcd.com/326/) 




 This may be in response to the university's plan to privatize a bunch of campus services, which would affect a lot of state employees.

EDIT: /u/robertrulez [says](http://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1xadtq/wtf_is_going_on_campus_loud_chanting_and_marching/cfaes2g) that's what it was. 




 The "Tits or GTFO" sign reminds me of a guy in Wichita during the big abortion protests there in the '90s, he made a sign that said "Show Me Your Tits" and joined the protesters; IIRC he said he was right next to them waving his sign for an hour before they noticed. 




 There's a dog across the street whose entire vocabulary of barks translates to "Hey, scratch my butt. No, don't stop." His tolerance limit has not been found; one neighbor spent about five minutes scratching this dog just to see if he'd get tired of it, and he didn't.

 Skywriting has been around much longer than GPS (nearly 100 years), so it's a skill thing. I don't know, but I suspect that in addition to detailed planning, they watch shadows on the ground for orientation.

 This particular plan may or may not work, but administrative bloat is one of academia's biggest problems, and it's rare to see it actually get addressed. 




 I lived a couple of blocks north of there for two years, and the distance was rarely a problem. Of course most of my classes were in the northwest corner of campus, so I didn't have far to go anyway.

If you can walk to 29th and Lamar, the 338 bus goes to the HEB at Hancock Center. (It may be shorter to walk to 24th and Lamar from where you'll be.) Also the 21 bus goes from the campus area to the Fiesta Mart at 38th and I-35, which is also a short walk under the highway from that same HEB. And Wheatsville Co-op is on Guad at 31st; it's a bit pricey on most items, but you can get some basics there without spending too much.

EDIT: Also, The 338, the 3, and the 22 (the same as the 21 only going the other way) also go to or near Central Market on North Lamar, which is basically an upscale HEB.  




   "... that company blends in the flavor of whatever company is asking for it."

I can't help noting the implication here: That Tropicana, Simply Orange and other brands' juice all come from the same place, they just get slightly different flavor profiles when the shipment is split up between them.

Not that OJ is unique in this regard ... 




 I thought trees made the wind blow. The trees would start moving and the wind would start blowing ... I had to be told that it happened in the other order.

Similarly, I thought when it rained somewhere, it rained everywhere.  




 Houston has 6 of the top 10 and 12 of the top 20. IMHO they shouldn't bother posting such incomplete data.  




 This is somewhere between incomplete and totally bogus. A 49-story building in Odessa? Really? And it's a Best Western? 




 Fred Phelps the head of the clan was a respected civil-rights lawyer before the nuttiness began. He had a lot of friends in the local legal community for a long time after he went all holy war; don't forget that anti-gay sentiment has always run deep among blacks in this country. If he had been Fred Phelps the Actuary he probably wouldn't have lasted long. 




 The bandwagon effect [is real](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6146/647.abstract). Saying you're not subject to it is the same as saying you're a freak of nature, like those people who claim that *they* can text and talk on the cellphone while driving and be perfectly safe. Nope. 




 How about that! 




 A little no-name sixplex near the north end of the Red River shuttle route. It's nothing special, and all the units are occupied ATM. The management company is Beck   Co., and I know they have other similar properties, so you could check with them. But I think a locator service is your best bet, since they deal with multiple landlords. 




 You're gonna need roommates. I'm 2 miles from campus in a tiny $500 studio; even other places in my neighborhood are going for a lot more.

Your best bet may be to use one of the apartment locator places you see on the outskirts of campus; you tell them what you want to pay, they'll show you some in that range. That's how I found this one.  




 Flash Motorbikes on Burnet Lane is my go-to service place. When I need a tow the guy gives me a discount because he can stop by after dropping his kid off at preschool two blocks away. He's had several chances to overcharge me and not done it. 




 In general, if the original increase was keeping pace with inflation, then it wasn't a *real* increase, only a *nominal* one -- it looked like it was going up, but it was only because the counting system in use was being degraded by inflation. It's confusing the measuring stick (dollars) with the thing it represents (purchasing power).

(This is not a comment on the policy in the OP, just on how these discussions often go in general.) 




 So it's a reduction relative to inflation, which does count. 




 Someone said economics is "quantitative psychology." Strewth. 




 Pornography is objectifying -- we don't see the participants as fully realized people. If there's a story involving the participants, it's basically just a frame to get their bodies together. Erotica engages more of our brain, shows us the characters as people with a full set of desires.

It's not a clear dividing line; some porn does some humanizing, for instance. It's a spectrum. 




 "I can't hear when you all talk at once" is one I've heard for that occasion.
