 We have Jesus here.. So yeah. 




 Sorcery... 




 This is true. I see them on a daily basis. 




 The battle in my head right now.. *think happy thoughts, think happy thoughts, think happy thoughts... I CANT!!* 




 My girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me earlier this year... I'd break up with her the day before she broke up with me. That would show her, and I would regain the upper hand! 




 TIL nothing... 




 eBay needs to do a lot of things.. 




 Erection, it does all the thinking at age 16... 




 If we're sharing stories, back when I was an RA I got a call at 3am from my boss saying EMS was on their way and I needed to meet two students outside with them.

Long story short, the boyfriend was at the girlfriends dorm room and while they were getting it on the girlfriend passed out and the boyfriend panicked and called 911.

While we were standing outside with EMS the boyfriend asked the EMS worker if she passed out because he was putting it in her butt... 
























 First thing that came to mind.

"Who's in charge here?" "The Clawww" 




 I don't typically steal, but I feel as though you have called me forth to perform a duty required of me due to the complexion of my hair. I'll keep you posted. 




 I got banned from selling on eBay. Apparently I'm sketchy and they don't think they can trust me. That's cool though, I only spent years building my eBay business to what it was. On the plus side I can still support their million(probably billion) dollar company by buying things from their site. They didn't ban me from that.  




 I'd be fine and dandy if it were this tree.

 Hopefully I'll be able to teleport over to the Walmart. I really hate driving 20 minutes for milk. 




 Ohio State was undefeated until.... yea, nevermind.. still hurts. 




 Thank god you drew a picture for the towel trick. 




 Plot twist: former students are famous in prison. *sings johnny cash covers* 




 I see they've had contact with the Chinese.
