 Holy Mother of God! They are sooo beautiful  




 I like Australis among the flaws that several have reported.  

One thing that totally breaks up the user experience is the sliding tab movement.  

What I've noticed it that is as long as the mouse pointer stays in the tab's area, then movement is smooth and perfect as usual; but the moment i go a bit down and over the Awesome bar or anything in vicinity, the drag movement abruptly stops.  
Honestly, its a total ruin because nobody can be so precise in maintaining the drag movement in such a small area.  

Please borrow idea from the competition and extend the drag-able area to the Awesome Bar also.  
Only then during fast browsing session can people feel the speed, mainly due to lack of disruption. 




 Ah yes, I did read about this, my Seagate cable has the usual plastic covering around it.  
I feel it was the driver problem though, after installing the proprietary drivers all seems fine :)  




 firefox creates a  new profile after install.  
better do the above mentioned method for fixing your problem. 




 Nightingale - though its a media player, it can browse the web too

 98 is just perfect!  
i really wish they rid of all the blue color for the icons, The original colors(Gold, greens etc.) have to be brought back.  
and i personally found the less curvy tabs more beautiful.  
Just wish they bring back what people need.   




 F1 cards 




 im installing it, do i need to uninstall the driver that comes along with fedora? if yes, do you know the package name?

EDIT-  
Ive installed(broadcom-wl;akmod-wl) and uninstalled nothing. Everything seems to be working fine and im able to connect my hard disk and browse for now :D :D :D   

THANK YOU! For your time and help! :D :D :D

Why cant the open source driver just be as good O_O?   




 I so wish they do this to DOWNLOADS. i hate a new window 




 yeah! :D i wish this gets implemented somehow 




 Sorry for the confusion  

i meant that an upward scroll of a few lines and "all the way up"scroll will reveal this toolbar menu.( if you use the new Facebook app you'll probably understand much easier) :)  

At the top position of the page the toolbar should be shown as default
 




 Since most of the highly used buttons of a browser are tucked away and accessing them requires more click or taps, i felt a disappearing toolbar area just like the way the new Facebook app does with 'Status|Photos|Activity' bar on the bottom would be great.  

Screenshot - https://imgur.com/Efav1kc

For  once you start scrolling down, it neatly hides its self, and only reveals when your are scrolling all the way up or are already at the top of the page.  
This way you still get back all the screen space and the most used buttons are always available to the users upfront. 




 unfortunately there is no debug file in b43 folder :/ 




 TouchPal is actually quite popular and free! Please do check it out :) 




 i've had this issue more profound on TouchPal keyboard. After i switched to SwiftKey, its kinda less, maybe RAM freed up?  




 its probably got to do with the google search suggestions thing.  
 




 1) I'm using the ones that came default with the Fedora install. I havn't modified the WiFi drivers in anyway so far.  
2) http://pastebin.com/4eL8pc9p

EDIT - the SSL thing is probably the https everywhere addon. And it include the normal browsing phase, HD connecting and internet inactive phase, and the back to normal phase once i disconnect the HD 




 1) 09:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4313 802.11bgn Wireless Network Adapter (rev 01)  
2) where do i find the logs to copy paste? 




 Wifi works on windows 7 after connecting the external HD.  
It seemed fine in ubuntu(long back) 




 ive got a seagate external usb hard disk and for some reason my Wifi stops working once i connect it. I browse through my android phone and the internet work super smooth at these times.
The current fix is only to disconnect the hard disk and continue browsing.  

Its a Dell N5110 15R system with Fedora 20 completely updated. Any way to fix this issue?   




 just try uninstalling/reinstalling the font support package via fedy itself. Fedy installs infinality http://www.infinality.net/ package for better font rendering. 




 i guess ill have to buy a new good phone without a physical menu button :D XD  

Yeah that's true, its just that it would be great if important buttons are laid out like the desktop version....hey! wait, is it possible to have a disappearing menu/button bar area, just like the new facebook app which has "status | photos | activity" that disappears while scrolling down and re-appears while upward scroll? 




  If the phone has a physical menu button, no menu should be displayed, unless the app has an outdated Manifest (might be the case for Twitter for all I know).  

Yeah that's it, the tradeoff between physical/virtual menu button. i feel it'll be best left to the user if he/she wants to enable the 3 dot menu button on phones with a physical menu button. 

i feel the most important buttons such as back, forward, refresh should be in a much more easily accessible location on the screen, instead of going through a menu.  


And thank you for the mention of gestures- will get an add on right away :D  

 




 on large screen phones, while holding it one hand, reaching the menu key to refresh or reload the page is painfully annoying.   
People need to shift the phone position just to do a simple refresh.  
And on large screen size phone's the 3 dot menu is not provided(due to design guidelines by google), but the Twitter app has still provided it. Some sort of fix or user choice enable/disable menu/custom button should be provided near the tab count icon. 




 The earth also, but we don't share it very well like the internet  




 Found that the twitter app on my phone has the menu option enabled - https://imgur.com/UfPwUUN

Guess sometimes user-experience comes first. 




 but at-least leaving an option in something like about:config would have helped lots of users out, instead of just disabling this menu button completely. :( 




 Its a Micromax A110 Canvas 2.
Yes it is has capacitive buttons on the bottom of the screen.

But the lack of a Soft-Menu button is a deal-breaker :(  
Since this is a phablet type(5-inches) device moving the finger from the screen to the bottom just to access menu button is quite frustrating. 

The FF team should have provided this option to the users to enable/disable the virtual menu button :( :(

Edit - runs on stock android jelly bean 4.1.1 




 I love it! 




 I Use the latest version Firefox Beta 29 (android) on a Micromax A110 Canvas 2 Device which runs on Jelly bean.  
I've noticed a three dotted menu button in various screen shots and other devices, but i do not have one :/  

Screenshot - https://imgur.com/cWb8yKn  

It kinda ruins the browsing experience because it is such a big phone and reaching down to access the capacitive buttons is totally a mess.  

Anyone know of a fix?   




 It is in the works, a project called Electrolysis

 happy to help! :) 




 well, if you have a no-history state, then you can pin in all the sites you enter the first few times. You can Drag and re-order them too.  

You can also pin the bookmarks by dragging and dropping them on any of the thumbnail.

Or maybe this add-on could help you - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tile-tabs/  
There 




 well copying of features works vice-versa in the open-source world.  
That's why good things spread and progress happens :)  

Custom tiles as in? 




 Great going! :) 




 The power that governments have these days can be misused.  
Take a look at Syria, Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, China etc.  
Forget the internet in places like North Korea.  

This is the why Mozilla has taken a stand to support a free and open web among other things.  




 Over the past few year, so many policies and controlling measures have come in to the world on controlling internet usage.  

We have seen SOPA, PIPA, NSA, NETRA(india), CMS(India) etc. that have been proposed to control the flow of content and hamper sources over the internet.  
This Clearly breaks the foundation of free speech, privacy among various other issues.  

Please take a stand and Join the effort - http://mzl.la/QQRcMM

YOU are the change and YOU are in charge!  

Our voice maybe tiny but it definitely leaves an impact in the world community, which the internet truly is, a global one.  

NOTE - Though you may or may not be a user of the Firefox browser. Please consider sharing this piece of info of your fav. social networks!  
It is no way a campaign to download the latest Re-designed version of the Firefox Web Browser(but if you do download/use, thank you for keeping the community strong)   




 Beautiful 




 Felt the same way too :D 
Good move Mozilla by launching Firefox and this on the same day 














 I've made a newbie linux guide. Hopefully you should find it useful! :)  
https://test_subject3336.wordpress.com/2013/09/22/linux-a-newbie-desktop-users-guide/

Share it with your friends, family if you would like to. Peace! :) 




 oh, thats bad :/

But if someone could figure out something like the new linear loading bar, it would be awesome! ;) 




 Thanks a lot for help and time! :) 




 ah yes it is indeed an external mouse. i've used it before without problems, but probably some update package has caused this :/ 




 THIS IS SO GOOD :D  




 I've noticed when I access the Options to tap-click things likes sync, customize, Mozilla etc. there this certain animation of one screen closing and the tap-clicked option opening up.  
Thing is on low powered(512MB) devices, there is a noticeable lag while this switch takes place. 

Is there anyway to disable this animation? 




 Me too!  




 Im having an issue while using the scroll wheel on my mouse.
If im scrolling down a page, sometimes out of nowhere, it bounces lightly and scrolls upward a bit.
This is mighty frustrating on long webpages when, i have to go through this effect every few lines that get scrolled.
The mouse works perfect and I've tested it in windows too without any problems. 

Anybody have a solution? 









 i use the nightly and the beta, the rounded back button still doesn't seem to pushed into beta yet.  
Hope it comes soon, makes the interface equal and standard over different platforms. 




 like the new website idea a lot! :) 




 i initially thought it was a gnome desktop with lots of beautification. 









 http://imgur.com/sXoizoK

Mag lines travel in a particular direction, if im not wrong, so wont this cause and upward force, considering the force lines flow from bottom to top?  
this is what i meant, just wanted to know if its possible. 
 




 Well if that's the case, then keeping one magnet fixed and the other in a container above the stationary one, the magnet should float or hover right? 




 I'd like to know if magnets on their own or using some combo can produce repulsive force of order like 1000N or so? 
What factors hamper such things, like area, material etc?

 Twitter follows the emoji pack - https://twitter.com/Support/status/451399393850052610 




 i'm not seeing the Anti-Firefox page now.
But the damage has been done. A big one i believe. 




 Time to boycott OkCupid.
There are thousands of people who may or may not support the LGBT groups, but seriously WTF is it got to do with a non-profit that makes a pro-privacy browser?

Edit : They(OkCupid) have to publicly apologize and make up for all the lost Firefox users. 




 They should get sued!  









 You'll have the Segoe UI Symbol Fonts i guess 




 well, technology evolves.  
But yeah i agree, there isn't much consistency over these symbols on different platforms 









 Just found that these two packages are available for Emoji support for Fedora Linux - gdouros-symbola-fonts   google-android-emoji-fonts

Made a blog post to help stranded users - http://test_subject3336.wordpress.com/2014/03/29/emoji-on-fedora-linux/

Also color emoji support might come soon if Noto Color Emoji comes upstream 




 thanks a lot, i hope something similar exists on fedora :) 




 The logo instead of the 'O' in fox - awesome! :D 




 I get these  - boxes with number's when i see an Emoji. Is is because im on Linux or is it the browser issue?  
Some of them are rendered pretty though. 




 Good Going! I Just hope more people are aware about this project! :D 














 ah yes, just saved the the top result on google ^ _ ^ ' 









 yeah thats also nice! :D

Though i love the whole shift to Australis, the issues above are worth pondering and acting upon 




 www.nsa.gov 




 The Direction looks stunning in the trailer 




 oh okay :)
Ive been trying to solve an issue involving these option, so just wanted to know if there was a manual page.  
Thanks! :) 




 This is the newer version that works for me(Some inconsistencies are present):

    @namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);

        #urlbar {-moz-appearance: none !important; background-color: #FFFFFF; border-radius: 20px !important;}
        #search-container textbox {-moz-appearance: none !important; border-radius: 20px !important;}

Edit - The code lines posted by @shortkey work perfectly on Firefox for Windows.  
The above lines are for Linux versions of Firefox 




 hey can i know from where you find out parameters like #urlbar and its associated options? 




 Nothing is. NSA clearly has an upper hand now.  
All we as common people do is enforce encryption in the services we use.  
It only increases computation time to break codes then. 




       they have to be manually changed I guess.
 
 Yes this would be most serious roadblock. Also I am not sure if different drivers would be available for these totally different kind of old hardware presen

Installing Linux takes 10 Minutes. Legacy Hardware support is quite good. 




 If its new Machine orders, manufacturers take care of preloaded OS.  
If its in use they have to be manually changed I guess. Once the switch is made OTA updates are possible to upgrade Linux Distro's.

Survival of Fittest.  




 Distro Dev's are contributors to Kernel Codes. 




 The post was about Linux not Unix. Out of the blue a Unix Kernel talk came and its reached so far. I'm done talking.

Have a Good Day.  




 Error Reports dont just go out in the name of UNIX. It goes back to the developers(Here apple and FreeBSD).
If its somebody else who developed the UNIX variant, it goes back to them. 




 Please go use a new good Linux Platform, you'll understand the way in which bugzilla works these days by auto uploading your bug-reports, even without you providing any details of the bug. All you need to provide is your email and password during the initial setup of the bug reporting tool.  

SER as you says only collects and gives to Micro - true, but whats the use if you pay for an OS that doesn't fix your problem??? Why are people wasting $ on a company that chooses if it has to fix your problem or not?  

This whole topic was on Linux and Windows.  
I did mention a bit above that Linux and Unix are two different things.
 




 This whole forum was on Linux.  

And as for Unix, FreeBSD a variant of it does the above. Also does Mac OS X which is a derivative of Unix, they do it well too. 




 It does, it does!

My error was on my end, not the mechanism 




 Damn you've got to be kidding me.  

Linux has Bug report systems like ABRT, Bugzilla. And they do a Better job than Send Error Report(which i haven't seen fix any errors).  

I dont know if you mean Autodesk 3ds Max, Maya, CATIA  as poorly designed apps. But ive got a heck load of problems when i used to work with them. 

And as for so called "unix distros don't have any central company to supply updates"  
Maybe you should use Ubuntu or Fedora and see how wonderful they handle updates.(That includes core kernel updates without breaking the system).
Also you're able to Upgrade the entire OS to the latest version from these central repositories. 

I use windows for my gaming, i love it for that. Its the only place it shines.  For work its Linux, because its reliable and stays solid

 









 Since Fedora is a community based Distro, i feel it'll be great to have some feedback from them itself for the Fedora Project to be leaders again in the Free Linux OS field.

I've been using Linux dating long back to Redhat Linux 7 and onwards.
There have been amazing changes. Since ive used Linux so long, its real hard for me to go back to my Windows OS.

Here are few areas i feel Fedora Project need to pay more attention to:

1. Looks:  
We have all the icons and everything is symbolic. Its perfect. But where it lacks is that its not aesthetically pleasing. People always tend to judge a product by its finish and looks. One amazing example here is Apple - Im sure most mac buyers don't go into the details of the OS or its usage and purpose, but just give into the looks of the product. The color palette needs a refresh i feel. 
Currently its functional not pleasing (from the eyes of a normal user)

2. Tutorials:  
We need to provide the common user an OFFICIAL source of Text and Video based tutorial regarding things like installation, Music, Movies, App Installation etc. It should be clean and no Gimmicks. And the best way to host them would be TORRENTS! 

3. Default Packages:  
This is one part im a bit sad about. Previous version of Fedora came with the big guns of open source like GIMP, games etc. but most of it is removed these days. 
Normal people wont want all the other packages(they consider it junk) just like all the those preloaded android phone apps from manufacturer's.

4. Do NOT scare the new user   
New users Judge a product within 30 seconds i feel. If they feel its complex, they leave, if its too simple, they question and wonder. Just provide what is needed. FAQ are the best way to address.

5. Bug Reports  
This is daunting for a new user. They go through this unknown thing called ABRT, then Bugzilla, (GOD WHAT's Happening :O) They have been scared to death already now. We need to simplify this process. And make them understand how things work on the open source end.

6. Customization  
This was what Linux is all about.  
Fedora needs to point users to where they can find new content like themes, icons (that's what a normal user cares to find)  

7. Proprietary Package  
I know this is the No! NO! but normal user eventually need them for their Graphic Cards etc. The community should make people understand that its OK for them to install but the packages are responsibility of the company providing them. A video might help clear the air. 

8. Media, Formats etc  
Another important area where we should educate users that they can watch their favorite movies, or listen to songs in Open Source Formats, BUT, since half the world moves on mp3, avi etc, options are always available to install player like VLC etc.

9. Social Media  
Maybe the open world doesn't agree with Facebook but that's where users are and that's where users share their content. We need to make a definite presence.

10. Presentation  
Easy to understand, clean and visually beautiful. Hit them right and i guess the world will start following.

We have YouTube/Torrents to share all this Tit-bits of knowledge for free!

Do share in  your views! :)

 









 I would like the make the Awesome bar rounded on the ends, also the Search bar. How can this be done? I've looked into add-ons, sadly didn't find any.   




 Thanks for the update to the nightly channel.

The white outline surrounding the icons, like the bookmarks, home etc. really help visibility! :D. Hope it comes to the actual release!

If you guys could just make the close button rounded like the new "back" navigation icon, it'll just be an epic win!

Go Australis! 









 Does anyone know what's the difference between drivers provided by Intel graphics installer and the original ones that come with the distribution? 




 I used a fully updated Fedora 20 Distro on a laptop with an Nvidia 525M Card. Its Optimus technology based.
I've read that kernel 3.13 comes with inbuilt power management features, so do i need bumblebee here after?
I've tried uninstall and reinstall the packages and drives using "yum reinstall bumblebee bbswitch bumblebee-nvidia" to no avail.
Anybody else here in the same boat?
*the bbswitch package was updated to ver. 8 




 I've noticed that firefox always needs to download the persona to display after launching the browser, this might be (just) okay on the desktop but on mobile its quite a resource hog and slows the start up performance of the browser.
There is a severe lag, when the connection is slow.

Why cant it be stored in the SD-Card or the Hard disk and be loaded straight from there?   




 i would like to know about your favourite clients on xmms2, do you still use the old or the new version and much more, Considering these were(or maybe still is) the best music player Linux will ever have!
To the Devs of xmms2 - please a standard out-of-the-box GUI _/\_ 




 Here's the link to the trailer - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrudC0STJ0U

Its not on the Soundtrack of the film :( It comes from some other source.

From a post on last.fm i found a few words of the lyrics

The lyrics appear to be -- "don't you worry ... about the flight yeah ..." ... "careful and true... we've flown..." ..."sing for the way we've grown... we grow..."
last.fm post -  http://www.last.fm/forum/5/_/527438

It might be an Australian band too, the film comes from Australia.
 



















 how do i know what chords can be played with what notes? I mean to ask if there is any rule that states that so and so notes and only be played using these chords?
And also how do i develop my chord knowledge. Thanks! 





























 i've put up a logcat long back on the page.
What more info is needed? i'll try to provide max details :) 




 i've tried all, beta, stable and nightly...but its still present. Hoping it gets resolved soon :) 




 i did try it out, still a major WIP but a real good effort :D 




 ah yes, very true that opera handles much of the processing on the server side.  

But i've had extremely good browsing experience on both dolphin and the stock android browser. I feel they dont disapper off because they are very lightweight in nature.   

If Firefox has just a bare browser thing on android, it would be awesome.

4.1.1 device here :)   




 it actually doesnt involve particular pages.
For eg. scrolling through general sites like Facebook, Complex just close the browser down. (i did file a bugreport on this issue - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1041968)  

Heavily noticed this happening while scrolling when the page is loading. 




 I've noticed a lot on low RAM devices(=512), the browser just disappears after a light usage run. I mostly suspect an Out of memory situation is the cause of it.  

But if a really light version like the something in the likes of a opera mini version happens then firefox can surely run stable on low end mobile hardware. 




 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1056875 




 i think its the problem with this new switching graphics tech.  
Hopefully someone will give a solution :) 




 Song to Siren - Candy soundtrack 




 ah nope
only H-title, video downloadhelper and downthemall 




 i've tried chrome, and things remain almost constant.  
I've tried on fresh profile, and all addons and plugins disabled.  
Guess ill open a bug report.   




 i really have a strange GPU issue while using firefox.  
My system dell n5110 has an Intel i3 and nvidia 525M optimus(Hybrid) running with bumblebee(Proprietary drivers) on Fedora Linux 20  
Every time i use Firefox, the GPU fan goes on and off over and over after a certain time of operation.  
My normal laptop temp is around 48-54C but when i use the browser its slowly rises above 60.  
The Processor clock jumps from 101MHz-1200MHz  
The Graphics clock jumps from 50MHz-600Mhz  

I've tried switching off Hardware Acceleration but this still happens.   









 thanks a lot for your time :) _/\_ 




 there's a lot of speculation that it could be Shirley Mansion of garbage 




 ah its not, song to the siren is a different one :/ 




 The song appears in the candy trailer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrudC0STJ0U  
The songs appears at 1:15  
Most believe its some unknown Australian Song.  
It's not present on the OST.  

Few of the words in the songs are:  
don't you worry  
about the flight yeah  
careful and true... we've flown  
sing for the way we've grown... we grown  
 




 thanks a ton, _/\_ it sounded so familiar!
i've listened a lot to this and yet it slipped away from my head  




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtIzADkd504

Could anyone let me know the song playing in the background? 




 This post should be stickied 




 lib-ray-off-is 









 Instabug, you guys should get intouch with Facebook, their android app kinda seems like hopeless now. 




 your issue is strange, try browser reset or new profiles (proceed with caution to back up data first).  
And check for updated sound card drivers.  
Incase its still faulty, then please do file a bug report.  

EDIT- webm and vp9 are implemented in Firefox but still needs smoothing out. So if youtube is serving you in these formats, then thats most likely the problem. 




  che, the issue disappears. But it appears again in a while.
 
 I should mention that I am usi

do you have mediasource enabled in about:config? 




 if you're on the stable release, try reinstalling flash and see.  
it looks more of a connection problem.  

If you feel its a browser problem, then try clearing cache.  
Still plauged with the problem, try a browser reset or a new profile.   




 your issue on linux? 




  #tabbrowser-tabs tab:not([selected="true"]) .tab-close-button {
  display: none !important;}

Hey thanks @shortkey :D :D :D
i just needed to change display: inline :D 




 try clear cache? 




 but i guess voting can bring about a perspective on the yays and nays of new features(mainly UI changes).  
Core technologies should be done as per firefox devs, which is much better in their hands.

 




 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856427 




 Why does the close button have to disappear just after 8 tabs?  
Its kinda annoying. Chrome allows upto 18 tabs with the close button present.  

Im kinda sure people have more than 8 tabs opens in a normal browsing session.  
Pic - http://imgur.com/01Eop1T  

Anybody know of a permanent way on keeping them on? 




 All the best to the new man!  
Hope we sail strong through the internet! 




 i guess a simple webpage where people vote yes/no on a new ui change or so could be an easy task for Mozilla, and better for Firefox progress as well. 




 Browser - firefox  
Arts - blender, Inkscape and GIMP  
Audio video - audacious, VLC, Winamp  




 Honestly changes are great as it happens.  
But then there are certain ones which are kinda very different, and need a lot of talking back and forth and agreeing to.  
For eg. the tab screen is really starting to look weird in nightly :/  
Is there any such forum or place where normal people can interact with the firefox development community? 




 also the rounding
 









 Lots of unticks on Chrome and Firefox even when they do support different things. 
 




 search for this 'media.mediasource.enabled' and enable it in about:config.  
its still a bit buggy when playing vp9 encoded videos - plays fine thought -test it out. you might like it.   

edit - To check if its on visit http://www.youtube.com/html5 




 if you really want to take some extreme steps delete the .mozilla folder in your home directory.  
Im also a fellow Fedora user with 2 Firefox versions, stable and nightly, and both are working fine for me.   




  d the Google Talk Plugin, and I've installed NoScript consistently with each new profile.
 
 Fair point though, a bit of digging says SIGABRT is triggered by angry libraries? I'll tinker with profiles (add-ons) in mind. Thanks. 

ill suggest a totally non-addon approach first on new profiles. check if that helps.
Or else remove it via yum and reinstall and see if that helps 




 Thats true. But I've faced similar playback issues on Vimeo as well.
The content would have already streamed ahead by the player will start playing for a few seconds, stop and if it wish continue playing more or until i click the play button again.  

Also the loading(buffering) bar keeps going out of its limits into infinity and beyond.
 









 sadly chrome is much smoother in video playback on linux 




 Try a complete system update and reboot or Try reset the browser.
If thats not helping create a new profile. 




 i would include all video sites in general. 




 codec for playing most web content - http://www.openh264.org/ 




 its happening on both Youtube and vimeo for me. Can't make a switch.  
HTML5 here we come! 




 ah the kernel 3.15.4-200.fc20.x86_64  
and Fedora 21 is still away

EDIT- GNOME yes they havnt updated, they'll be pushing it out on the next version with wayland support 




 oh okay, not much familiar. i'll just shut my mind :| 




 But pretty much everyone installs them anyway, because otherwise your video players don't work.

thats true, but i guess mozilla is trying for an out of box working option.  


and also, i think might be better if a software runs with its own set of stuff, than pulling stuff from the OS every now and then 




 i guess most distro's don't ship the bad and ugly versions of gstreamer.  
Also Windows tech is proprietary  




 i saw this after the latest update 




 Thanks for the link! :) 




 Fedora 20  
Gnome 3.10.2 




 Seriously wish it had a fill background option too. 




 and thank you guys for making a great browser! :D    
i wish i knew how to code properly and contribute. i only know bits and pieces of C++ 









 Is it possible to extend a persona theme as a complete background onto the speed dial area? Im not wanting a background addon that allows me to choose a background image, but something that just utilizes the persona theme itself or the colors in it to give a good back ground 



















 You just need this and all's good https://www.google.com/tools/dlpage/hangoutplugin

 




 Do try out the beta or nightly version. They kinda work better than the stable version for me.File bugs too when crashes happen. 




 It has performed much better in recent times but things like chrome displaying the page as soon as it loads, kind of create a better illusion of speed.
Things need to feel very smooth for the users.
Even the tab movement area is much smoother and of larger area in chrome that in Firefox. Miss the area and you create a new window while reordering the tab. 




 maybe chrome might use google dns built in(not sure).

But since the android app is also not working, it needs to be a DNS issue. Bombard BSNL! xD 




 the instances ive got crash reports, ive submitted, but this as you found out was different  




 thank you for the link! :D 




 yes...you too? 




 Sad state :/  
something good needs to be done to thwart that drm cancer. 




 hmm probably true, i use like a normal user, i'll have apps that maybe running in the background without me knowing also.

ill shall try find the log file and submit soon 




 I don't see how Shumway will allow Firefox to get users back. Most people don't exactly use Flash voluntarily. They need it because video sites require use of patented codecs (H264) and DRM.

Linux users are fed up with Adobe flash(no new versions-except security updates), and most crashes happen due to flash or some flash based content on webpages. Plus lots of people use YouTube and other video based sites a good part of usage, having something inbuilt and stable like shumway like the way Google does with Pepper, it should probably improve the reliability of the browser. 




  Can you please file bugs about these issues? This sounds really strange, should absolutely not happen, and we don't know of any current issues like that. Do you have some task killer or anything installed that's nuking Firefox while it runs?

Sure i shall file a bug, but i just have no content to attach to a report sadly :/
It'll just close down without any message while browsing. And i dont use any task killer.
 
 It already uses very little memory, and will work well on any Android phone with as little as 384M RAM (Firefox uses FAR FAR less, but your other apps will eat up most of that!).

i do know it does uses very less, but when other apps are also present, then things get slow, like using swiftkey, whatsapp, facebook and firefox one after the other :/
  




 i think some DNS server is at fault.  
Unless someone fixes it, it'll be the same situation for people who are routed through that server or ISP.  

The bigger problem is that YouTube is not aware of this issue. Some thing similar happened to WhatApp users in india connected to a particular ISP. Only after the social media and news exploded was the service fixed.  

People need to inform YouTube about the issue! Attack Social Media! 




 Hats off to the developer community for all the work they've done all these years. Truly, its been a great product. And i keep hoping for more good stuff from you guys! _/\_ MASSIVE RESPECT    

A little focus on more important things will probably show a positive change eventually. It will take time to fight back whats lost to chrome, but im sure a good number of them will be Firefox users who are wanting to come back to where they felt at home before.   

I guess Firefox also needs to increase its social media presence, Google can do it for Chrome through their ads system, but Firefox has to fight it out without spending much on Facebook, Twitter etc.

Once Firefox fixes up electrolysis and Shumway, that coupled with the privacy, peace of mind and the add on ecosystem, it will be a great combo to make some groundbreaking ad to get back whats lost, and add more new users.  

it will take time, but these should be worked on with a great pace now, coz time costs everything these days.   




 i agree the attitude of the common man is hopeless.  

only few of us try to make a valid change. I try a lot to convince people to shift to Firefox. Some do but others just stick it to the other competition because it works out of the box and without any trouble.  

I still feel Firefox has every chance to grab back the market it lost, if it starts focusing on the current basic essentials to web browsing.  

Back to square one is the need of the hour. 




 i feel the browser should focus on delivering speed, lower memory usage, per Tab process and shumway.  

Honestly i don't think normal people do care if a browser is super developer friendly with all the features it provides; The general crowd wants the content or webpage to load super fast and with very little to no problems.  

I've tired Firefox Beta on Android and the Nightly versions too, but there are lots of performance issues, when compared to others in the market. Ive got lots of instances when the browser will just close without even a Crash Pop-up to send an error report.  
Plus Firefox Mobile needs to make use of less resources(RAM etc.) of low end phones, since most of them are 512 MB RAM mediatek chipsets.

Its been a really long wait from the browser that was a game changer back then :( 




 i think its a DNS issue, lots of people are facing this, but in certain locations, or based on the browser.  

Cause chrome is able to go through. But the YouTube android app is totally failing to play and same with Firefox.  

Using google dns solves this problem :D
YouTube or your ISP(im not sure whom) has to fix this problem.  

https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/

 




 enabled as default. still no change on Firefox PC version.  

i've also noticed that the android YouTube is also failing to play videos.  
This is totally weird, since its working perfectly on chrome(desktop).   




 same issue, works on chrome.
latest nightly build. FF33.0a1 Linux 




 same state unfortunately :/  
But please do spread the news if you can to others who could help out. :)    

Lots of apps have language support problems because there not enough user contribution   




 i also have a horrible problem on vimeo, where the video stars playing, streams ahead but the player automatically stop and ive got to hit the play button again. Very annoying!
Linux Build.  




 Since the keyboard is now free and everyone can download from the Google Play Store, it would be great to have Malayalam language support for those like typing in Malayalam on their smartphones.

Kindly contribute to testing if you could. Or spread the message!

 same, i was deeply interested in the Gary McKinnon case but everything seems to have disappeared.  
I also feel that's there a lot of classified technology that could be used for the greater good but haven't been made public for political or monetary reasons. 




 Hello 

UFO, aliens and any other cover ups, Still speculation or is such info being suppressed?  




 yea, plus the 400 word message after the limit is just a fantastic move to communicate if all goes well.

Its about as poetic as apps come. It should feel like postcards rather than letters,

Ofcourse i agree to your comment that doubts will be raised, but so far he's been the only person trying his best to cast them away.

 Give This Man(Elon Musk) A MEDAL! 




 so many low cost devices suffer due to thier old policies 




 its sad if its a flash issue :|  
i hope Shumway comes through fast.  
But then all sites have this problem to a varying extent, leaving me totally clueless on what/why its happening :( 




 yeah, they had been horrible with kernel support.  
hope that will change soon for the better 









 I've been noticing this for quite some time now, video's even though fully loaded tend to stutter a lot during playback.
It was more profound on vimeo, when the playback stop and the video  button changes from the pause button to play button. The video was fully loaded though - http://vimeo.com/48043470 - this was the video, while this thing was happening.  

Its also present on facebook videos, though to a lesser extent, and least on YouTube.  


I played the same vimeo video in another browser(chrome) and it was playing very well, even while streaming without any stutters.

 Well, it's like an iTunes clones visually, with support for themes and add-ons. It's good for managing music when you have a large library. It's got SoundCloud, last.fm integration among others. Auto scrolling lyrics support. And the most important of all, it still works as a browser.  
I use it and am definitely happy. Of course there are minor bugs here and there bug for a normal user I don't think it'll be a problem.   
It's the open source version of the now abandoned Songbird media player.  




 its more of an annoyance when people are trying to get work done fast.  
Something like ad pop-up windows ruins your internet browsing flow 




 maybe a few millisecond time delay if you hover over the bookmarks icon, to add to bookmarks, can fix that issue i guess 




  't been fixed yet, along with some tab-tearing and tab-pinning visualization, when Australis is all about "beauty" and "sleek-ness". I guess it's because Firefox ships with tabs on top by default, which makes the lack of this "tab sliding movement" almost unnoticeable (or less painful) in maximized state, because you can just press your pointer against the top of your monitor and when moving the tab (that is

It is however a pain on Gnome shell, because on the main panel on the top, so even if you move up a bit, your off the main firefox window, and eventually create a new Firefox window.  
This exists on the latest Nightly too. 32.0a1
