 Anyone see the guy grab his dick at the end?  




 Works for me on Google Chrome.  




 Those original game cube controllers must have cost you a fortune on Amazon... oh wait, yes it did. 




 He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector... a Cat Knight.  









 Should be The Last Of Us.  




 Does anyone notice her leg on the left is facing the wrong way? If you pulled your leg all the way back like that her knee would be touching the top of her head...

EDIT: Never mind I see it now....
 




 Well that escalated quickly. 




 I think this has more to do with your tastes maturing rather than just the fact of more exposure. If I hate something I hate it no matter how much I'm exposed to it; only if my tastes and attitudes change will my opinions change.  




 No. Just no.  




 Skyrim Total Enhancement Project (STEP). Search it up and follow the directions for a much more beautiful game.  




 Sounds like you need new friends.  




 CATERPIE!!! 




 Mission Impossible 4?? 




 What kind of girlfriend uses sex as a bargaining tool? 




 and the first? 




 The Playstation 2 could: play all Playstation 2 games ever made.

YA DON'T SAY 




 Guy was caught jerking off in the library. Apparently he had came into a few books before.  




 "Black" 




 Pikachu main, here. I use the c-stick for quick down smashes (roll + down smash is king). Whenever I want to charge a smash I use direction + A.

I'd say it's more personal preference than anything, I know some great players who don't use the c-stick at all. I have found, though, that all the insane players I know ALL use the c-stick. So it would seem that it is your friends that are the noobs and you that are the pro. 

C-stick is also invaluable for directional air attacks. Pikachu's are amazing, so I use the c-stick A LOT for that.  




 Your sister is a certified qt3.14 




 Iguana meet this girl. 




 Why girls need to lie about this stuff is beyond me.  




 WHERE'S THE C-STICK? I NEED MY C-STICK 




 You come across a child drowning in a river.
Would you rather save the child's life and have no one know what you did, or fail to save to save his/her life (even if you could) and be forever known as the hero who tried? 




 In Asian countries they have a plastic bin right next to the trash meant for liquids. Why they don't have that here is beyond me.  









 More like scumbag EA. 




 This is such an obvious shop it's not even funny. 




 Why is this in cringepics? 




 I see what you're doing... 




 Hashtags. 




 Your picture actually made me say "oh my god" out loud. First post in a LONG time to make me do that. Congrats. 




 Not on campus, but pretty sure I might have seen it off campus near Shadyside or up Craig Street. Lots of buildings that look similar close to CMU.  




 You are NOT overqualified for anything. Get your ass out there and work! 




 The Social Network. Epic, touching, Harvard and Trent Reznor. 




 haha sorry, I actually am almost out. I know quite a few people who have more than a hundred dollars left though :) 




 This design was submitted.
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29374/Sample.png
Who could possibly say that the design that was chosen is better than this one? The quality of the submissions was not the problem here. 




 Not very good, the teacher is pretty bad and doesn't teach econ very well. Fortunately, I took AP Micro in high school, so I was able to do well. 
It's not a particularly hard class, so if you're able to get through her B.S. teaching you'll be able to get an A.  




 I can't believe CMU ended up with this design. With our amazing design and arts school, I never expected this would happen. 
The petition that was created the first day of voting did nothing, and the creator of the petition was told to take it down because it might offend the creators of the design. I highly doubt anything we do at this point would be able to change anything.  




 it's bytes, like I said CMU's internet is INSANE. 
and Donner looks super ugly from the outside but it's pretty nice inside.  




 I live in Donner, which is really nice, coed by wing (west and east), largest rooms for a double, walls are pretty thick here. Apparently Stever is considered one of the worst freshman dorms so if you liked it you should be fine anywhere. Morewood has the smallest rooms though, almost tiny compared to mine. 

The internet here is AMAZING, I get ~13 mbps download speed on WIFI which in my opinion is incredible. Yes, sometimes it cuts out randomly for like half a minute but it's infrequent enough that it's not a nuisance. Ethernet is the most stable, never ever had it cut out but I get slower download speeds ~10 mbps. You have a 50 Gb download limit for 5 days but you will never EVER go over it, I download large files constantly and have no problem (I once redownloaded my entire steam library and was fine). There are gaming clubs, not sure if for CS:GO but I'm sure you could form one easily.  




 Red 9. You won't be eating very much here, even though there's no buffets except Shatz they give you a lot of food. I'm a dude that normally eats a lot and these blocks fill me up to the point where I only need to eat two meals a day and a few snacks I can buy at entropy. Red 9 gives you $720 DineX which is more than you should ever need (most people don't use it all, and I actually have to make an effort to spend all of it by the semester).  




 go live in any asian country 




 he tried to hit backspace to delete the "i" but he hit "=" instead 




 I heard they gave out 2,000 tickets but they only have space for 1,500... I doubt even people with tickets will be able to get in. 




 Read, sign, and spread my petition. https://www.change.org/petitions/cmu-id-design-2013-2014-choose-better-designs-for-cmu-s-new-smart-ids 
























 Yeah my garage has been duplicating my cars too... weird.  




 From what I've heard the Surface 2 is only a few hundredths of an inch thinner than the Surface RT, so thinness isn't really that big of a difference. Apparently the weight difference is quite nice, though I haven't had any problems with the weight of my RT. I got my 64 GB RT for $200 and I feel no incentive to upgrade to the 2 except for the better screen. I think $250-$200 is the perfect price point for the Surface RT 




 I have the AMD Radeon HD 6630M and I can run at at 40-50 fps. Just run it and play around with the settings a bit.  




 Surface RT runs on flash memory, not a hard drive, so the slowdown shouldn't be from there. Did you run Windows Update multiple times? The updates fix a lot of the lag/slowness issues.  




 Those floors are only accessible by CS students. If you have a friend in the CS department, just have them open the door for you. The elevators work the same way too. 

Or you could get lucky and "conveniently" walk in after someone opens the door.

2. My Killing Floor for his Half Life 2
3. http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1mljpn/h_killing_floor_3_copies_steamgift_w_offers/ 




 I can do Half Life 2.  




 In order of interest: 

* Chivalry: Medieval Warfare
* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
* Max Payne Bundle
* F.E.A.R. 3

Willing to trade any or all my keys for any of these games 1:1. Or counteroffers I'm not particularly picky.  




 I have three copies of Killing Floor as Steam Gifts, includes the game and Defence Alliance 2. Looking for any offers.  




 Just give IE a try. I was skeptical at first too but it really is a great touch experience in tablet mode.  




 Realistically, what do you use NFC for? And why is it so important that if it doesn't have it it's a deal breaker?

Not bashing, just curious. I think NFC is a great tool but I haven't found any practical applications of it that would make it a deciding factor in purchasing a tablet or phone.  




 MathXL puts the CORRECT answer in the box after you get it wrong, so the answer in the blue box is NOT what you input. If you mouse over the box a window will pop up saying "Your answer: _______." I'm sorry but I'm 100% certain you input the y = which is technically an incorrect answer.  




 Well the y = is already given... so technically you DID input the wrong answer. 

I know, I hate MathXL as much as anyone else, but you just gotta learn how to deal with the annoyances.  




 Bought one of these and it did come in original packaging. It arrived packaged and presented as if I had bought it direct from Microsoft.  




 TI calculators, like the TI-83. They were invented 14 years ago and they still cost $100.  




 Really? Send me a link for a flashable rom? 




 Can't believe Sense 5 is on a Samsung Galaxy product before the HTC Evo 4G LTE and the HTC One X.... 




 I will be in an efficiency.  




 Sounds awesome, thanks! 




 Yeah I realized that as I was going about my business today. TJ Maxx also sells pans and dishes, too. 




 Refunded the whopping 1 cent they paid.  




 Well I'm still going to be going to Target anyways, no way I can bring all that stuff in one carry-on :P 




 Thank you! Did they really give you a dining table and a couch?? 




 Yup, I know that. I wouldn't expect them to give that to us. 




 What appliances are included in the Fairfax kitchens? Fullsize fridge, oven, stove, microwave, sink? There's no information on the housing page.   




 New Facebook cover photo right here. 




 Stark didn't say it was vibration proof, he said it *absorbed* all vibrations, meaning the shield can still vibrate but none of that energy is transferred to the wearer. Big difference.  




 I see. In which case decide whether a college degree is really worth it to you. If you foresee yourself getting a better job/being happier once you get a degree then go for it. I don't want you to be like "well what do I do now?" after you graduate.  




 You should go only because of the fact that it's a unique and rewarding experience. College is a unique experience because everyone there is living together and striving to achieve the same objective - the only other place like that is the military. The lessons, skills, and friends that you have there makes it well worth your time.  




 There was an incident that happened during Orientation Week at my school... it is now known as the "Brown Leg Incident."

During the first night of school a guy invited a girl to his room, and they began to get down and dirty. His roommate was trying to sleep on the top bunk and got so fed up that he left to sleep in the lounge. One of the RA's walked by and asked him what was going on, and together they went to investigate the room. 

While the two lovebirds were alone they had switched to anal sex, and were going at it full force when his roommate opened the door. The shock from the door opening and the ongoing sex caused her to unleash her bowels in full force all over the guy's leg, and due to crappy school food it was runny and full-on disgusting. We all ran out of our rooms from the sound and saw the couple covered in shit and fully embarrassed. 

Both students switched dorms after that.  




 On the thumbnail it looks like his nose is made of a dirt block. 




 Looks like Frogger couldn't handle this challenge, either. 




 I've always felt it was the other way around... Name a few games where you think this happens? 




 DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAAAAAAAAY 




 Sounds like your girlfriend's a keeper. 




 Just because someone uses those services doesn't mean they don't like face-to-face conversations. 




 AWWW HAAAAAAIILLLL NO 




 .... How did this happen?? 




 Insidious. The most terrifying thing I have ever watched in my life.  




 Lifeguards will give you so much hell if you bring those to a public pool. 




 It's pretty obvious how to use this machine correctly, too.... wow.  




 I think you should stop replying to his texts outright... To a guy, any response means that there is hope that you will actually get with him.  




 Pikachu doesn't even know what's coming... 




 DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAAAAAAY 




 stoopid hooman... 




 Could have put the rupee ocarina in a pot and had him smash it, too. 




 Typical rich, preppy white girls with Macbooks and Coach bags. Doesn't even look like it's raining that hard.
