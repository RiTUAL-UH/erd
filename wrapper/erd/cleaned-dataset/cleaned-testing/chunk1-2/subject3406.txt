 I am noting the plural, and I wish you noted the singular and capitalization of what I had written.

I said that a cynic might take the position that the Court, singular, capitalized, and in context, clearly the Supreme Court, seems to use standing to hear cases it wants to and not hear cases that it doesn't.

I went on to elaborate about how standing jurisprudence is incongruous. (And it is.)

Which relates to my original point-a cynic might well find that the Court (singular, capitalized) has made these incongruous decisions on standing based on politics. 




 Not sure what the bolding is for.

Lujan creates a new standard for standing. Lujan requires an injury in fact to a legally protectable interest, that has to be concrete, particularized, has to be within a concrete particularized injury within the statute, imminent, actual, and not conjectural. Redressability is another big hurdle for standing that Lujan delves into-in order to have standing, it must be likely that a favorable court decision can redress the harm at issue.

One major element of Simon is that it was a case about redressability. Yes, the complaint described instances in which the individual respondents were refused treatment. This part could not be said to be speculative. But still no standing because the S.Ct. found that a favorable decision would not necessarily mean that the harm would be redressed.

This brings us back to Duke. Many of the harms listed in Duke were not imminent or actual, were not concrete, and were conjectural. The Court in Duke did not run through the full eleven criteria the Court created in Lujan. Why the different standards of standing? Politics. The types of injuries in fact alleged in Duke were not different in their redressability from those of Simon. Ruling in the plaintiffs' favor would not have necessarily meant the harm would be averted or redressed. The Court decided this did not matter and they could still get to the merits. Why the different standards of standing? Politics.

The case law on standing is contradictory and incongruous. Period. 




 Sure. Compare Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, Simon v. Eatern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, and Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc.

All three are standing cases.

In Lujan, the Court finds that there is no relationship between the harm sustained, traceable to the government, and that the harm is too speculative.

In Simon, the harm was, again, too speculative to be considered the concrete injury required by Article III.

In Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., the claims at stake were no more speculative than in Lujan and Simon. Nevertheless, a majority wanted to decide on the merits so they could bring certainty and stability to the nuclear power industry. Sure, the claims at issue were, if judging by previous decisions, speculative, but by finding there was standing, the Court could (and did) then go on to uphold the constitutionality of the Price-Anderson Act that puts a cap on damages from catastrophic nuclear accidents. This cap is required, for practical purposes, for nuclear plants to get insurance and so by taking the case and ruling the way they did, the Court was able to help the nuclear industry. Pure politics.

(And to illustrate the speculative nature of the claims in that case, note that one of the rationals for upholding the damage cap was the argument that in the event of a catastrophe, surely Congress would devote extra resources to relief efforts. A: Is there anything more speculative than guessing what Congress would do in response to something; and B: must have been a sign of the times because today, it would be very much in question if Congress would devote any further resources to relief!) 




 But in practice, it's not so simple. The cynic's view of standing is that it is a doctrine used to decide cases when the Court wants to decide a case and duck cases when it doesn't.

He lit a co-worker's vest on fire. With co-worker still in the vest. How could he not have known he was risking injuries to others?

 If the bill turned out to be counterfeit, not only could you reinstate the fine on the computer, you also had his name, address, and other contact information.

 Casablanca. Just thinking of the opening scene (with the map), I can hear the narrator's voiceover in my head. "....But the others wait in Casablanca. And wait. And wait. And wait." The map itself is visually gorgeous and it the scene sets the tone for what follows. 




 There are plenty of sanctions against the DPRK already, and there isn't much we can do. There was little ability to do much even before North Korea became a nuclear power, and now that they are, there's REALLY not much we can do.

 My condolences on your loss, monolithburger. He looks like a very nice, funny person. You and your family are in my thoughts. 




 I like appointed judges over elected judges. The work of courts is supposed to be apolitical and cases are too nuanced and individualized for campaigning. 

I have never forgotten my freshman government class where we watched campaign videos from judicial elections. There was an attack ad against an incumbent judge blasting him for never once sending a criminal to prison. Well, that was true-the judge did never send a person to prison. The judge was a district court judge, and so only heard misdemeanor cases, where the maximum penalty was 2 and a half years in jail, not prison.

After that, I definitely prefer appointments to elections. 




 The keynote speaker, Dartmouth College Professor Donald Pease, is reputed to be excellent. Friends of mine took classes with him and have universally had nothing but good things to say. 









 Kevin Coughlin's suggestion to require very noticeable green license plates for sex offenders would not protect children, it would lead to executions and assaults of sex offenders. And even for those who believe that's acceptable (and unfortunately, many believe protections of law don't apply to all), the collateral damage of shooting a sex offender driving 55 miles an hour on a highway or the falsely accused offender etc. would be awful.

Not to mention that definitions of sex offender vary considerably. Masturbating in a porn theater, public urination, public sex (which could be getting laid, at night, in the back seat of a car, in a lover's lane or deserted parking lot) flashing, a 17 year old making porn of themselves, high school students sexting, or a high school senior sleeping with a sophomore, can be enough to make the sex offense registry in some states. The sex offense registry has morphed beyond it's purported aims of protecting kidsthere's no evidence that someone busted for some of these offenses make one any more likely to target kids. 




 From what I've gathered, Markey wasn't comparing the substance or equating the two as equally wrong, just that there was an equal need to overturn a S.Ct. precedent. It was a procedural comparison, which Republicans are falsely portraying as a substantive comparison. 




 Replace Geoffrey Rush with Jim Carrey as Lionel Logue in the King's Speech. Just imagine what Logue would teach King George VI to sound like! 




 Study, but don't overstudy. It's a pass-fail exam and every point you get over passing was time you could have spent doing something fun or meaningful. 

Honestly evaluate your skills. How did you do on big closed-book exams in law school? How long did you study and what result did you get? Extrapolate your individual needs and talents to figure out a realistic amount of time you'll need to study.

Beyond that, if you're halfway decent at multiple choice exams, the multistate section is not so bad. And for the essays, treat them like any other issue spotter exam, don't panic, use clear reasoning, and you should do fine. 




 Classic mythology was created by people who were trying to explain the world around them and didn't have the scientific knowledge to give an accurate account. They knew that thunder and lightning occurred, didn't know why, and so they believed that there was some dude on Mount Olympus throwing lightning bolts. And hey, peacocks kind of look like eyes, so, peacocks must be related to eyes! Etc., etc.

People who read news accounts of the legal system don't know the law, don't understand the basics of the system and certainty not the complexities, and so instead, they come up with their own mythology about how the legal system works. The more bits and pieces they come across, the more confirmation bias is at work and convinces them that they are right about how things work. And hey, any little piece that gets rebutted doesn't matter because they aren't experts and it's okay to get a few minor details wrong.

This is how we end up with people claiming that calling something Sprawlmart instead of Wal-Mart or calling it the fast food joint with golden arches saves it from being libel. It's not much different than people running around claiming to be sovereign citizens, claiming the income tax is unconstitutional, or claiming that writing a status message on your Facebook message can exempt you from changes to Facebook's privacy policies. It's the psychology of conspiracy theories, just not applied to conspiracies.

 Ronald Kessler's books are pretty decent... And James Bamford's books on the NSA (The Puzzle Palace/The Shadow Factory/Body of Secrets) were good too.

 There's 2 violinists from a PG County youth orchestra that sometimes played at the top of the Friendship Heights station 3 or 4 months ago. They were really good, the acoustics worked pretty nicely bouncing around the circular stonework (minus the screeching of the escalators), and I tossed a few bucks their way every time and stopped for 5 minutes or so.

Then again, I saw them on my way home. Had I been off to work at the time, I'd probably have just kept going.

Getting in trouble with bosses isn't worth listening to a street musician, even if it's Joshua Bell in disguise. I'd rather get paid and have the money to see him in concert! 




 Dahl also specifically stated, "Theres a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity ... I mean there is always a reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didnt just pick on them for no reason."

Dahl claimed to draw a distinction between being an anti-Semite and being anti-Israel, but it's safe to say he was both. 




 There's a neat museum you may have missed: the Kreeger Museum, in NW near American University. It's a private museum, in the former home of a Geico President, with works from impressionists, American artists, an African art collection, etc. all things that the Kreegers acquired.

It's open to the public Friday and Saturdays without reservations, otherwise, you can call to make a reservation during the week. (They're closed Sundays and Mondays.) The cost of admittance is $10.

 This case should not have gone to the merits.

I join with Columbus School of Law Professor Victor William's difficulty in reconciling Canning v. NLRB with Nixon v. United States, 506 U.S. 224 (1993). Nixon involved the political question doctrine with the Supreme Court deciding that the separation of powers prohibited judicial meddling into/judicial review of the nature of a Senate impeachment trial process that used a committee of 12 senators to actually try the case, and then all 100 senators voting. Professor Williams describes the ruling in Nixon as, "[T]he Court explicitly ruled 'the word try in the Impeachment Trial Clause does not provide an identifiable textual limit on the authority which is committed to the Senate' The nations highest court would not conjure a definition of the word 'try.'" (from http://dccircuitreview.com/2012/12/14/reply-political-question-answer-to-recess-appointment-test/, internal citations omitted.)

Williams then goes on to make that argument that if the Supreme Court wouldn't create or settle on a definition of the word try, courts should not define the word recess either. Quoting the language of Nixon, Williams writes, "Just like the word 'try' in the Impeachment Trial Clause, the word recess in the Recess Appointment Clause 'does not provide an identifiable textual limit on the authority which is committed to the [president].'" (Id., again, omitting internal citation). 




 And she got away with killing Vince Foster, too, right? 




 (And note that I don't give a damn about her political future. I care about protecting the independent judgment of prosecutors, even when I disagree with them.) I am in no way affiliated with Carmen Ortiz, the DOJ, or any government-related organization.) 




 Downvote me all you want, but what precisely is the lesson that you want to teach? 




 MIT didn't call the Secret Service. JSTOR didn't either. MIT called Cambridge Police, Cambridge Police brought Secret Service into it through a member of the Electronic Crimes Task Force.

The Patriot Act established the ECTFs. ECTFs can get involved in crimes with significant community impact. This is a term of art that allows the Secret Service to intervene much more broadly than you suggested, imustbreakyou.

Did the Secret Service have to get involved? No. Is their involvement a sign of a broader, politician-driven conspiracy? Also no. 




 It's not a grand conspiracy. One of the Secret Service's primary areas of responsibility is cybercrimes. It's their area.

I don't see any evidence Swartz's activities were significant enough to rise to the attention of any politicians. 




 I'm not suggesting that they should not both be punishedI'm saying that the punishment for a hacking breaking into a bank's computer to steal money and an 18-y-o high school senior breaking into a school computer to change a failing grade shouldn't be given the same punishment. 




 Unlike some who are (figuratively) seeking US Attorney Carmen Ortiz's head for her office's prosecution of Aaron Swartz [1], the EFF's Marcia Hoffman lays out a practical solutionreform of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The CFAA is incredibly overbroad. If my technologically-impaired mother, who still once in a while needs a gentle reminder on how copy-and-paste works, is capable of committing a hacking offense under the CFAA, the statute is too damn broad.

A senior lawyer with the DOJ's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section has informally taken the position that merely using an open wifi network that does not, in its name or otherwise, explicitly make it clear that it is open to public use, could be prosecuted under the CFAA. The same for use of a coffee shop's wifi network if not in the coffee shop. Use of a neighbor's unsecured wifi should NOT be a federal crime.

As Hoffman points out, the CFAA does not define what authorization means or requires in the context of the state prohibiting gaining access to someone else's computer "without authorization" or in a manner "exceeding authorized access." The obvious fix is to define what authorization is. This shouldn't be a term of art that can be stretched to fit behavior computer owners or the government does not like. (I'd go so far as to question whether the statute should be deemed void for vagueness, but I'll concede that is impractical-I wouldn't expect a court to actually rule that way.)

The potential punishment for violations of the CFAA are not proportionate to the potential offenses. It's one thing to throw the book at someone who hacks a bank or ATM network to steal money or someone engaging in corporate espionage, and another to throw the book at Swartz, or a college student trying to change grades, or a teen banned from a videogame server trying to find a way around said ban.

I have said elsewhere on Reddit, and I'll repeat here, that I don't believe folks should be making an example of Carmen Ortiz by trying to get her removed, anymore than it was appropriate for Ortiz's office to try to make an example out of Swartz. The problem is not that Oritz and her office violated prosecutorial discretion or exceeded the bounds of the lawthe problem is that her actions and that of her office were entirely within her discretion and that her reading of the CFAA statute was entirely reasonable.

 Yes-there was a short-lived midseason replacement run on CBS called First Monday, starring Joe Mantegna, about the Supreme Court. It was enjoyable, but didn't catch a big audience.... (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Monday) 




 There's nothing nefarious or unusual about this. Cases are dropped when defendants die. It's routine. 




 For some other views on the subject, take a look at Ron Coleman's Likelihood of Confusion blog. http://www.likelihoodofconfusion.com/the-making-martyr/ Coleman argues that the potential penalties are too big, but also, "He did steal that stuff.  Information doesnt want to be free  its stuff, and it wasnt his to free.  I think he should have gotten in trouble."

Professor Ann Althouse argues, "He knew what he was doing was criminal, and he was a very intelligent man who chose to do it anyway and conceived of what he was doing as actively virtuous." http://althouse.blogspot.com/2013/01/aggressive-prosecution-2-internet.html Althouse succinctly summarizes the issue in her second to last paragraph: "But he knowingly and willingly committed numerous felonies, did he not? I'm not hearing the lawyer say that Swartz didn't do what the prosecutors said he did. The argument was that the law ought to be different. If you break the laws as a way to make that argument, how is the prosecutor supposed to respond? Your argument is to the public and to the legislators." 




 I don't think the prosecution of Swartz was necessary, not do I think it was a horrendous abuse of prosecutorial discretion. There's arguments for and against prosecution, and neither option would have fallen outside the bounds of reasonableness or proprietary.

Swartz may have been a real criminal committing real crimes. That he thought he was doing the right thing does not negate the resources that JSTOR put in to stopping his activity. From press reports (and yes, making these judgments from press reports is always dangerous), it appears that Swartz knew MIT and JSTOR didn't want him doing what he was doing.

Your argument that we should never prosecute cases like those against Aaron Swartz, with a link calling for firing Carmen Ortiz, is an absurd one in the absence of a fleshed out argument. Swartz's conduct, at best, fell into a gray area of the law (and I'm not so sure it wasn't clearly a criminal violation under the CFAA). Ortiz's conduct was well within ethical constraints-she did nothing wrong. If people don't like the system, change the system. Calling for the head of one prosecutor for doing her job is a bizarre reaction.

As for my characterizations of your argument, that's what happens when someone makes an assertion but not a real argument. Guessing at what your argument is is all you left us with. 




 A: I didn't argue against you posting a link. I questioned what your argument actually is.
B: You still haven't actually made a cohesive argument. What should prosecutors be aware of?
C: If you disagree with some of my arguments, fine, but it's a wimpy copout to say my arguments, or lawyers' arguments in general, are what's wrong with the justice system without so much as identifying what you are finding objectionable. 




 The maximum potential penalties were outrageous, but the maximum potential penalties for just about any federal prosecution are outrageous. That's why over 90% of federal prosecutions end in a plea bargain.

Is it outrageous to believe that Aaron Swartz violated the Computer Frauds and Abuse Act? No. The statute is incredibly broad. Did Swartz have fair warning that his conduct was not welcome by JSTOR? There's a strong argument that blocking his IP addresses, and later his MAC address, were signs that he was engaging in behavior outside what JSTOR permitted.

His actions impacted MIT's relationship with JSTOR, for a time, JSTOR was unavailable to MIT students and faculty, and while JSTOR may have reached a civil settlement with Swartz, MIT had an interest in his prosecution as well. Moreover, the wishes of a victim are not always followed in criminal casesprosecutions are subject to the decisions of the State and not victims or their families.

None of which is to say that I agree with prosecuting Swartz or even with the scope of the CFAA. Arguing that Carmen Ortiz should be removed from office, or that as lawyers we should never prosecute cases like these, however, are sloppy arguments not based on facts. Swartz's behavior reasonably fit conduct that the CFAA proscribed. It is absurd to blame prosecutors for faithfully prosecuting conduct Congress made illegal.

What exactly are you referring to when you refer to "cases like those against Aaron Swartz"? Cases under the CFAA? Are computer crimes no longer illegal? Or did you mean cases where victims are not interested in prosecuting? In which case, leaving aside MIT's involvement or not in the decision to go after Swartz, I take it you are opposed to prosecuting cases of domestic violence once battered spouses are not interested, or able to express an interest, in further proceedings? This is far more nuanced than is being reported. 




 NESL is well-regarded in the area, but there's no justification for paying their dean higher than Harvard, Yale, etc., or higher than Suffolk University's dean. 




 Free speech does not mean getting to say whatever you want to say without any consequences. It means that (for the most part) government cannot sanction you for speech, but private actors can certainly do so.

Time Warner is a private company. Getting to choose what they do and not put out over their cable networks is an act of free speech in and of itself. 




 As others have pointed out, a thief can't gain title to stolen property. As for the issue of statute of limitations, if committed by a US citizen, stealing a trillion dollars could reasonably be called treason. Treason has no statute of limitations and is a capital offense. 




 It doesn't really matter how bad they look to a general electoratethanks to gerrymandering, the risk to most House Republicans these days isn't a general election, it's the primary. Those who are not ideologically pure are getting well-funded primary opponents. Impeaching a democratic President would be wildly popular with their base, regardless of the merits of such an action. 




 Well, yes, I should rephrase slightly-anything that would otherwise be admissible would be admissible... 




 This. The government did not induce anon's actions in any way, therefore, anything they found can be used against the teens involved. 




 There's an argument to be made, it is by no means a slam dunk, nor is it automatically a loser. If decided on the merits, I suspect the current Court would likely strike down the argument as unconstitutional, but there'd be a reasonable chance the Court would punt and not intervene based on the political question doctrine.

Politically, this would almost certainly lead to an impeachment attempt.  Probably not worth it. 




 Isn't there always mass law student drama? :P Grades, whose dating who, fighting (or threatening to sue) over student bar association elections,....? 




 It's certainly legal to restrict public access to a public building. (Can't just wander into a prison, afterall.) Perhaps it would be better to reframe the issue in terms of the school's obligation to leave students out in the extreme temperatures for unsafe periods of time. That's a far stronger argument (if you can substantiate it). 




 Were there any consequences when that happened? IIRC, there's no private right to sue under FERPA, and I don't think the feds sue over inadvertent disclosures unless there is a history of repeated issues. 




 Offending others is not illegal. Flipping off a cop is constitutionally protected speech. I'm sure folks were offended by a guy in a LA courthouse wearing a jacket saying Fuck the Draft in the midst of Vietnam War. It was, nevertheless, found to be protected speech by the Supreme Court in Cohen v. California. A few years after Cohen was decided, the Supreme Court found it was unconstitutional for a New Orleans ordinance to prohibit cursing at New Orleans police officers. If it's not constitutional to prohibit saying "fuck you" to a police officer, the symbolic equivalent in the form of the middle finger can't be punished either. 




 Yes, refusing police orders can be resisting/obstruction/other types of charges, but if you believe a passenger tried to summon your aid, do you keep him in the car with the driver? That sounds a bit off. 




 Seems like an obvious First Amendment violation. The officer's claim that he took the middle finger to be a potential call for help is incongruous with ordering the person calling for help back into the car while making a traffic stop. It may be an unwise decision to flash the bird at cops, and unsurprising for cops to respond by detaining those who do it, but it is a constitutionally protected expression of free speech. It's no more egregious than the actions of Paul Cohen's wearing a jacket saying "Fuck the draft" in a Los Angeles courthouse, an act of expression the Supreme Court said was constitutionally protected in 1971's Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15. Obscene gestures are similarly speech, not conduct. 




 There are certainly specialists in Supreme Court practiceTom Goldstein, David Frederick, Ted Olson, and others. The NYT wrote an article on the practice in 2010: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/1 /us/10lawyers.html?pagewanted=all  




 I'm not familiar with Texas, but my impression is that in most jurisdictions, criminal defense attorneys are disciplined regularly. Even criminal defense attorneys deal with trust funds, commingling funds issues, etc.

 An obvious Brady violation... Unfortunately, prosecutors are all too rarely disciplined for unethical conduct.

 First Amendment rights have been drastically curtailed in school, certainly, but students do have some level of First Amendment rights in school. See Tinker v. Des Moines. 




 Absolutely! No internet would help me not notice what I'm missing! ;-) (In the interest of honesty, though, I should note I'm already a pescatarian...) 




 We would have been better returning to the days of the Clinton tax rates by going over the cliff. It's not as though the '90s were marked by human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together, and mass hysteria-it was a prosperous time. Now, the House Republicans feel they lost on a big issue, and will be even more motivated to be obstructionist in two months when it comes to the debt ceiling and sequestration. I fear that by not allowing us to go over the cliff and return to Clinton tax rates, something that wouldn't have been catastrophic, it sets us up for failing to raise the debt ceiling and defaulting on our debt. 




 When your party pushes to cut food stamps and welfare, when your party opposes providing healthy school lunches, when your party opposes providing health care to those in need, your party's key platform is turning one's back on people who are starving, freezing, and in need of help.

 Um, no. Hedley Lamarr is a character from Blazing Saddles. The actress/inventor was Hedy Lammar (her full name was Hedwig Eva Maria Lamarr). 




 Hollywood actress Heddy Lamarr was the co-inventor of frequency hopping. The original patent involved  using a piano roll to change between frequencies in the hopes of making torpedoes more difficult to jam. Frequency hopping would later be the basis of spread-spectrum communication technology, including wi-fi-, Bluetooth, CDMA, etc. 




 University of Connecticut offers an LL.M. in Insurance Law that may well be worthwhile, given that so many insurance companies are headquartered in Hartford. AFAIK, that program has a strong reputation. I'm not familiar with any other school's LL.M. program, so, it may depend on individual circumstances, the market at the time you're thinking of going (and when you'd graduate), etc. 




 Historically, the law treats pets as mere property-value of replacing a dog or cat or what have you, nothing more. There is a push to change this, but I'd be surprised if it was judicially imposed, especially in Texas, instead of changed via statute. 




 Heh. No ideaI'll have to ask!

I expected a floppy hat at JD graduation. They showed us floppy hats as samples when signing up to rent our regalia. But nooo.... I pick up my regalia to find that JDs get mortarboards, just like undergrads. Bah! Bah I say! :P 




 This isn't so much a legal question so much as one of philosophy, and is a question with answers that vary depending on where you ask it.

Some US states have abolished the death penalty, but on the other hand, in 2012, nine states executed 43 people. Many believe the death penalty to be cruel, or capricious, at risk of executing the innocent, wrong for the state to kill, or what not, while others believe that the death penalty provides deterrence, promotes public safety, and gives victims' families closure. The clamor for extreme punishment in India is not surprising in light of the conditions there-activists are arguing that violence against women has gone unpunished for a long time, and they are working hard to change this.

It is too big a generalization to take conditions in India as a sign that society overall is moving towards more barbaric punishments. It may be true that some in India are pushing towards more barbaric punishments, but there are also places that are moving away from capital punishment.

Uganda continues to flirt with a bill that would criminalize homosexuality and provide life imprisonment or the death penalty for engaging in same-sex acts, same-sex marriage, and the like. In Europe, the constitutions of Belarus, Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montengero, Poland, Serbia, and Ukraine define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. On the other hand, in the United States, nine states (CT, IA, ME, MD, MA, NH, NY, VT, and WA), DC and the Coquille and Suquamish tribes have legalized same sex marriage. Nine other states (CA, CO, DE, HI, IL, NV, OR, RI, and WI) have domestic partnership options for same-sex couples. In Europe, eight countries allow for same-sex marriage and 13 others allow other forms of partnerships.

Why am I bringing up same-sex marriage/partnerships? Because it demonstrates that you can't draw global conclusions from the acts of an individual nation. Sure, Uganda's continued attempts at passing a "kill-the-gays" bill is very alarming and horrible. But it doesn't mean that society at large is moving towards recriminalizing homosexuality. 




 Up until a few years ago, the value of LL.M. programs was primarily for foreign attorneys looking to practice in the US and American attorneys looking for tax-related jobs. Other than the tax LL.M., LL.M.s in other areas were generally not seen as worthwhile until very recently.

In the current legal market, however, that calculus may have shifted. Gaining a focus in a very specific area, getting to work more one on one with professor advisors, and, for the grads who hit the market in the midst of the '08/'09 collapse who need to reduce or eliminate the effects of resume gaps, resetting that gap, are all things that may make LL.M.s in other subjects make sense now.

I'm about to enter an LL.M. program for specializations in health law and policy and administrative law. Health law and policy is a hot area, expertise is required, and an LL.M. may help me land a job. Moreover, I've seen government job postings where a LL.M. would allow me to start at a higher grade/step or make me eligible period.

Is this a gamble? Absolutely. Going for the LL.M. will either be a brilliant move or incredibly stupid of me. But at least I'll finally get to wear that tam hat I coveted at law school graduation when I saw all I got was a dinky mortarboard while the LL.M. students got the nice hats.  *rueful grin* 




 Your high school grades don't matter once you're in college, so, it's only a concern as far as getting into a good college and how well you think you might do in college.

It's too early to worry about the job market because the job market is in such flux. Yes, the legal market is awful right now. But by the time you'd be looking at applying to law school, all sorts of things will be different. Don't let that discourage you.

A lot of very well-meaning people will tell you that it is too far away to think about careers, that you will likely change what you want to major in and what you want to do. This may be true for some, but not for all. When I was your age, I decided I wanted to major in government in college and go on to law school, and everyone told me I'd change my mind. When I met my college advisor freshman fall and told her I wanted to major in government and go to law school, she told me I'd likely change my mind. I majored in government. I went to law school. (I'm now going back for my LL.M.) I regret graduating in the midst of the law market collapsing-that was an unpleasant surprise-but I still wouldn't change my decisions, and I did exactly what I had been saying I'd do since 9th grade. It can be done. 




 Thanks for the suggestionI was thinking about getting a hand creme since they put hand sanitizer on their hands every time they walk in or out of the room. 




 Ooh-that's a great idea! I hadn't thought of a Starbucks gift card. Thanks! 




 Thanks! Would I be better contacting the Nurse Manager, or the CEO, or....? 




 Thanks-I'll definitely be sending in a thank you note, and I think my Mom will be doing the same. 




 Thanks for the suggestions and for the well-wishes! 




 Thanks! :) 




 *nods* That might be a bit tough to surprise them with...
 




 Ooh-good ideas! Thanks! 









 The average person commits several crimes every day. We can't lockup everyone. (For example, Harvey Silverglate wrote an excellent book on the subject: http://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent/dp/1594035229/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1356098597 sr=8-1 keywords=silverglate )
 




 No reason to hang on to casebooks. Books that have actual explanatory texts (there are a FEW decent casebooks out there) and some supplements like E Es may be worthwhile holding on to for more advanced classes within the subject, but casebooks that are purely edited cases? Useless after the class is done. 




 Adorable! What is your sheltie's name? 




 Claiming that statistics gives probable cause? Good grief. A 1L could get any and all evidence stemming from these illegal stops suppressed. 




 I'm thrilled to read that NBC's Chief Foreign Correspondent and his crew are safe after several days being held captive by an unknown group. I'm a big fan of his.

I am, however, a trifle disturbed that NBC seems to have asked for a media blackout during the days they were missing despite no specific evidence that reporting would endanger them. There seems to be a bit of a double-standard for reporters in harms way versus everyone else.

"According to NBC, there "was no claim of responsibility, no contact with the captors and no request for ransom during the time the crew was missing." Whether or not one agrees with Gawker's decision to run with the story, their determination that there were no specific or even general threats to Engel's safety if the story was publicized seems accurate according to NBC News's own article (in the link).

Would news organizations not report on this sort of thing, in the absence of an articulable, specific concern safety, were it not one of their own?

 Inherit the Wind is not jut my favorite law-related movie, but in a 3-way-tie with Casablanca and Rio Bravo for my favorite moves overall. A wonderful script and even better acting. Spencer Tracy and Frederic March were both amazing, and Gene Kelly's cynical newspaperman, E.K. Hornbeck, might be his finest performance.

My Cousin Vinny is a great movie so long as you are not required to watch it over and over and over again. I loved it, before I had to watch it (or substantive parts of it) in 3-4 law school classes and the bar-mandated professionalism class. Then it got a little old hat. :P

 andrewthestudent's outline provides a great constitutional framework. As for how the death penalty is defended, common arguments are deterrence, closure for victims' families, a need for finality for the system itself, and the need for especially strong punishment for the worst of the worst. Common arguments against the death penalty are that it is wrong for the state to kill, that mistakes can be/have been made and are unavoidable in the future (the work of the Innocence Project has been especially powerful), that the death penalty is more expensive, that the death penalty is arbitrary and capricious, and that the death penalty is both racist and classist (rich people don't get executed).

If you are looking for resources, take a look at the Innocence Project's website, take a look at Amnesty International's website, take a look at http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org , and take a look at http://www.prodeathpenalty.com/articles.htm . 




 Absolutely no reason to use anything extra other than bar prep course materials. The most important thing is to not panic during the exam. Read the question carefully, and respond the way a lawyer would. It is less important to remember case names or even case law than it is to respond in a clear, logical fashion.

Beyond that, I'll pass along the sage advise one of the barbri lecturers told us: every point you get above passing is wasted effort. You don't need to get 100%. You're not looking for an A. You're looking to pass. Don't lock yourself in a law library exclusively for three months. See friends. Read fiction. Go to the movies or the theater. Hell, go to a strip club. Just make sure you are balancing your time so you don't burnout studying.

Study the prep materials, practice the multiple choice questions, get a good night sleep the night before the exam, and don't panic during the exam, and you should do fine. 




 Even if Arafat tests positive for polonium, that would still be insufficient to conclude that Israel was responsible. Turkish sources are reporting that polonium was one of four poisons found in the remains of former Turkish President Turgut Ozal, who died in office in 1993.(Other three poisons being DDT, cadmium, and americium.) Israel had no reason to poison Ozal-Israel/Turkey relations were strong under his rule. If Ozal was actually poisoned with polonium, it demonstrates that there are other actors in the region with access to polonium and a willingness to kill with it.

Has Al Jazeera looked in to the allegations of Ozal being poisoned? Are there any suspects, and did these suspects have reasons to kill Arafat or have ties to those who would have such reasons?

 Respectfully, Congressman Issa, a law can't constrain Congress from exercising its Constitutional authority to pass legislation. If your bill passes and is signed into law, it will constrain agencies and departments, but Congress can still turn around at any point and pass whatever it darn well pleases. It is advisory at best.

Moreover, preventing the FTC, the FCC, and other agencies from regulating or burdening the internet for two years is a very broad prohibition. Prognosticating the future is hard. We don''t know what devices will be created, what services will be created, how they will be used, how they will be abused, how we may want to impose limits on interacting with children, etc.

If in a year, Google announces that it is selling driverless cars (or licensing the technology to car companies so they sell driverless cars) that use the internet for downloading and uploading navigation, traffic conditions, etc., that could be amazing. It could reduce the scourge of drunk driving. It could empower the disabled. It could be turned into a hybrid of car pooling/mass transit. BUT-it also poses questions and concerns and a strong need for regulations from the Department of Transportation to ensure that the technology is safe for users and for everyone else on the road. Burdening or regulating internet-based driverless technology is prohibited by your bill. That's not good.

It's too easy to say that if something comes along that requires regulation, Congress can pass legislation that modifies or overturns this bill. Given the current partisan gridlock and no signs of relations between the sides thawing, it is dangerous to rely on the ability to pass future legislation to fix problems. As much as is possible, potential problems need to be predicted and dealt with in what passes now. 




 Kathy Greenwood. 
























 As someone who was born 100% deaf and had surgeries as an infant that restored my hearing to relatively "normal" range, I am baffled, putting it mildly, that there is a segment of the Deaf community that attacks cochlear implants for treating deafness as a disability and not a cultural identity. Have you encountered any hostility for having the implants, and how have you dealt with it? 




 Bench trial. No jury, so verdicts can be a heck of a lot faster. 




 Didn't mean to criticize-I was just confused. It was an interesting (and I'm  sure, frustrating for you) story, and I'm glad you shared it! 




 Note: I am not your attorney, I'm not giving you legal advice other than to tell you to seek counsel in your area, I am not advising you on courses of action to take or when things have to be done.

Disclaimer out the way, if you're in Montgomery or PG county, I might be able to give you some names of attorneys in the area.

It's a misdemeanor-a crime that carries a potential fine and/or potential jailtime as well as MVA points. It's probably a decent idea to consult with an attorney in your county-this isn't a mere parking ticket. 




 I strongly urge you to consult a lawyer to advise you how to handle the charges. For one thing, you'll want to investigate if being found guilty or pleading to the Utah charges could affect your current probation. 




 I am not licensed in Minnesota. I cannot give you legal advice. 

I'd continue to keep an eye on the MN case records, but I'm not sure what you could gain by contacting the court or DA's office yourself. If you are concerned, you could/should contact a local defense attorney. He or she can advise you what to do next, if anything, and if it becomes necessary to speak to the court or the DA's office, he/she can do so on your behalf. Remember-anything you say can and will be used against you. That's not just a TV line. 




 Unfortunately, this sort of thing is a common scam as others have noted. It sucks, not just because you're out $50, but also because it means that when folks are in situations where they legitimately need emergency cab fare etc., it's impossible to differentiate oneself from a scammer.

You could contact the local police, since you have their phone number and it actually goes to them, but if it goes to a burner phone, or if your local police are a busy bunch, you're sadly out of luck. :( Sorry. 




 Thank you. :-) 




 That saidI'm not convincing you, you're not convincing me, and nobody else is participating or paying attention. We might as well agree to disagree and leave it at that. 




 Depends who you ask.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/24/AR2010112404510.html 




 Your hypothetical: "if a Senator proposed a sweeping ban on "obscenity". There's already a sweeping ban of obscenity, as you seem well aware. 




 You proposed a faulty hypothetical for a law and actions that already exist, and I'm splitting hairs for pointing out your hypothetical is pretty much already in place?

Senator Feinstein didn't claim that she was qualified to write a law because of her experience with the shooting, she pointed to her 20 years on that Senate Committee and 9 years of experience as a mayor, too.

Yes. There is no exactly analogous ban on obscenity. What this has to do with the price of tea in China, however, escapes me. Getting back to the original argument, that we have plenty of limitations and exceptions to other Constitutional protections like the 1st and 4th Amendments, not specifically enumerating what is and is not obscene is not something that makes it less of a limitation on First Amendment protections. I'd argue that it is a greater limitation because of the chilling effect and, I'd argue (and lose in court, but I'd argue it anyway), that the nebulous definition of obscenity violates the void for vagueness doctrine. 




 Ah! That would make sense. 




 Is there context that we're (or at least I'm) missing, or did this woman randomly decide she won a prize? 














 And if you insist on a Senator arguing for prosecution of obscenity, instead of merely the Romney campaign and GOP '12 party platform, how about a letter signed by 42 Senators (the vast bulk of them Republicans but some Democrats, including Senator Feinstein), calling for prosecuting all major producers and distributors of adult obscenity, with a focus on internet porn. http://www.politico.com/static/PPM153_obsc.html 




 Here's how I can claim obscenity prosecution was a top priority of the Bush Justice Department: http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1125318960389 slreturn=20130216131119

As for your complaint we've moved from your original point, let's recap. Your original point was that if a Senator proposed a sweeping ban on obscenity, you'd hope other Senators would be as zealous (your word, I'd choose others) as Cruz was the other day with the 2nd Amendment.

When I pointed out we already had a sweeping ban on obscenity, you complained I pointed to caselaw and not a statute. When I pointed out the statute, you complained it was little used. When I pointed out that it was a major priority of the George W. Bush Justice Department, you complained that the small percentage of convictions was negligible. When I pointed out that the Republican party and Mitt Romney stated their intent to do exactly what you claimed would be outrageous (going after a wide range of porn on the web and elsewhere), you ignored it.

Which one of us is moving the conversation away from its original point, hmm? 




 Wouldn't the wiser course be to contact the cops and ask them to deal with it? If there are drugs, guns, etc. inside, do you really want any level of responsibility for it? 




 Peter David's "Q-In-Law" is a classic.... 




 I agree entirely-two years as a sample size is not enough to determine whether global climate change IS affecting tornado season. I was more interested in the bottom third of the article where it discusses the competing forces on how global climate change COULD affect tornado season. 




 This is a bit of an odd role reversal given my original comment, but it appears you are arguing based on passion and I am using facts.

How many people are currently prosecuted under the federal obscenity statute? Not many, perhaps, but during the GWB Administration, the DOJ taskforce targeted some big fish, and all it takes is a few selective prosecutions to have a massive chilling effect. You didn't see the internet suddenly devoid of porn, but more fringe pornographers did close shop for fear of prosecution.

Big names that were targeted include Paul Little (AKA "Max Hardcore") sentenced to 4 years in prison(1), Ira Isaacs (who came to public attention for distributing the 2 Girls, 1 Cup video) was sentenced to 4 years in prison(2), the DOJ prosecuted John Stagliano for milk fetish porn(3), and a woman named Karen Fletcher was prosecuted for "fantasy stories...pedophilia, torture of children, and murder of children."(4) Fletcher's work was disgusting, but it was also purely text-no children harmed in the making of the work and all.

I can do better than naming a Senator-how about a major party's platform and a party nominee for President? Yes, that's right, the Republican Party platform in 2012 stated, "Current laws on all forms of pornography and obscenity need to be vigorously enforced," and the folks who pushed for this language made clear that they meant going after porn on the internet, on pay-per-view in hotels, in retail shops, and on pay-per-view on cable/satellite TV. (5) Mitt Romney himself called for strict obscenity prosecutions. (6)

**the tl;dr version is (1) that Bush made obscenity prosecution a major feature of his Justice Department; and (2) that the most recent Republican Platform and Mitt Romney made it clear they intended to use current obscenity law on the books to go after 100s of types of images and movies, and if Senators or others raised hell, we seem to have both missed it.**

 I'm merely a consumer of weather-related information, but to my novice eyes, this seemed like an interesting look at how warming trends may increase convective available potential energy while decreasing wind shear. 









 There IS a sweeping ban on obscenity. Under Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment. 




 Good for you! That sort of mistreatment of employees is beyond unacceptable. 




 Ted Cruz's condescending treatment of a fellow Senator was disgraceful, and your link's describing Senator Feinstein as "lash[ing] out with emotion and hyperbole" continues the misogyny. (Taking a thesaurus to "hysterical" doesn't make the sentiment any better.)

Senator Feinstein wasn't a recalcitrant witness. She was not there to be cross-examined. Cruz was free to make his argument, as silly as it may seem. (There ARE limits to the First Amendment. Child porn is but one-material support to terrorists, fire in a crowded theater, fighting words, obscenity, time, place and manner restrictions, etc. There ARE limits to the Fourth Amendmentvehicles is certainly a huge one.) But Senator Feinstein was free to make her points, and was under no obligation to answer Cruz's haranguing questions. 

Senator Feinstein made her points based on her years of experience as a US Senator and politician, her experience with the previous assault weapons ban, and her experience putting her finger through a bullet hole on Harvey Milk's neck as she tried to see if he had a pulse. 




 Wired magazine has a decent writeup explaining the court's ruling and its significance. http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/03/nsl-found-unconstitutional 














 Um, story time? When was this? Do you know what happened next? 









 The only advice I can give you is a caution that "If anyone has experience with copyright law (particularly in Canada)" isn't the right inquiry. The only thing that matters to you (assuming that you're in Canada!) is Canadian copyright law. The copyright law in the US, UK, or the Federated States of Micronesia won't help you in an actual legal dispute (as opposed to an academic conversation).

Try finding a clinic, a public interest group (like the EFF in the US), or whatnot to help if you can. Otherwise, please do speak to a lawyer in your jurisdiction. 




 The kid on both teams wasn't Danny Alamonte. This wasn't a 13 or 14-year-old ringer on the 10-12 year-old team. I don't see how this team got an unfair advantage from the kid playing on two teams, and it seems really cruel to strip them of the opportunity to play this weekend. Surely this could be dealt with without the need for collective punishment of kids. 














 If the accident was indeed both of your faults, you might not be entitled to anything from the insurance company. Or what you're entitled to may be reduced. Or you might be able to recover in full with pain and suffering damages. It depends on the state, and a lawyer can help ensure you don't screw yourself over. Proceed without a lawyer and you're likely to eff yourself over. 




 That's adorable! What is the kitten's name? 




 Where in the county? I've had good luck with Medstar Health. I go to their location in Spring Valley, about 3 blocks past the Bethesda/DC border on the DC side, but they have lots of locations throughout the metro area.

Since they're associated with Georgetown Hospital, I'm pretty sure Medstar Health takes most insurances. 




 But there was no evidence, to my knowledge. 




 Incredibly misleading way of phrasing it. Your phrasing suggests that an Israeli film crew actually did hand out candy to get people to dance. 




 Not a huge fan, but I supposed given the conservative nature of the present cardinals, there are few options I would have been a fan of. His position and his past statements on same-sex adoption are particularly disappointing.

 The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a non-partisan office, scored the Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare") as reducing the deficit. Republicans such as Paul Ryan continue to make false claims that repealing Obamacare would aid with deficit reductions when in reality, it would increase the national debt.

Why isn't the President, and the White House, being more forceful in rebutting these false claims? I understand that the President is trying to reach a "grand bargain," and to do so, he is trying to court Republican votes (or at least stop obstructionism), but by not going on television and repeatedly demonstrating that these claims about Obamacare are not true, it allows conventional wisdom to form that Obamacare does raise the debt. That's not helpful for an eventual grand bargain. That undermines national support for the President and for his policies and continues to ossify public perception that the GOP's plans would lower the debt and not merely shift the tax burden from the wealthy to the poor and middle class. 




 This doesn't make a great deal of sense. Yes, he was on sick leave for an extended period of time, but if this was cause to fire him, why wait until now to sack him? The vast majority of the comments have focused on how long he was on sick leave, but that is irrelevant to why he was sacked.

Looking at the stated reason to why he was sacked, according to the Independent, is that if he was well enough to travel to Australia, and well enough to grapple the shark, he should be well enough to work. This does not seem logical. For the sake of argument, let's view things in the light most favorable to Mr. Marshallsea. Being on leave for stress shouldn't mean he is on bed rest, going on vacation seems like a reasonable response. Whether it is in Australia or London shouldn't make a difference. That he was capable of grappling with a shark is not particularly of import because he was not on leave with a physical disability like a bad back, injured shoulder, or what not.

Given that going on a vacation is a decent way of dealing with stress, and that his reason for being on leave was psychological and not physical, what difference does it make that he went to Australia or grappled with a shark? 




 Hmm-perhaps that's what she was going for, but even then, as a former ANC Chairperson, I'd think she'd constitute a public official, and her statements were certainly an issue of public concern, namely alleged corruption and theft of public funds. 




 Good question, and I'm not sure what the best move is. One of the risks of truth serum is not just that one might be found sane, but that one might say something damaging in response to a question that might have led to pleading the Fifth had one been in one's right mind. 




 There's a surprising dearth of articles on the subject, but there are some, and they support what the Guardian reported.

 I agree-it sounds like bad science and like something that should not be admissible, but it also sounds like something that should not even be permitted to be attempted.

You and I are in agreement that this should not be admissible, but I respectfully disagree with your assessment of this as bad reporting. Sounds like the Guardian got the events right, and the judge may have (I hope) gotten the law wrong. 




 I hope it's only bad reporting-if it is as described, it seems rather horrifying. What part of the report are you disputing? 














 I'm not a DC licensed attorney. My understand of DC civil procedure is that the DC courts give a more generous view of pleading than other jurisdictions, but even then, to my eyes, the complaint embedded in the linked article seems incredibly flimsy.

1: The statute Ms. Seegars cites does not state what I think she thinks it does. She cites 23-542 which discusses wire interceptions and interception of oral communications, and yes, certain conduct is prohibited by this section. Unfortunately for Ms. Seegars, 23-542(b)(3) states that "it is not unlawful under this section for...a person not acting under color of law to intercept a wire or oral communication, where such person is a party to the communication." Joshua Johnson was a party to the conversation, he recorded the conversation, and unless he recorded it with the intent of using it to commit a crime or other injurious act, it's okay under the statute. In other words, DC is a one-party-consent jurisdiction, both parties were in DC, are DC residents, Ms. Seegars is suing in DC court, and the statute she cites is one of the defendant's best defenses. Bwah?

2: The statute she cites is not related to libel and slander. It's a wire/oral communications interception statute. Bwah?

3. She does not specify in her complaint what exactly she is claiming to be libel and slander. As far as I know, and if I recall correctly, DC does not share the same heightened pleading requirements for defamation that other jurisdictions have in place, but even then, the allegations need to be specific enough to allow a defendant to form a responsive pleading. Merely saying "libel and slander", without specifying what the defamatory remarks are, is not sufficient to my knowledge.

4. Unless there are remarks the article is not referencing, it would appear the defamatory statements are things she herself said. In which case, bwah?

Is there a logic or merit that anyone sees to this pleading, or is it the rantings of a pro se plaintiff abusing the legal system?

 Indiscriminate? Hypothetically speaking, if the strike that killed the infant in question WAS an Israeli, would it have been indiscriminate, or would the determination that "Palestinian militants were firing rockets at Israel not far from the al-Masharawi home" persuade you that an errant strike, while awful, happens in wartime? Collateral damage is not avoidable-mistakes happen. 




 She was thinking about buying flowers and therefore she should still get the promotion? By that logic, a guy who was thinking about going to medical school until he flunked organic chemistry and switched his major to film should still get to practice medicine. 




 There are sites where you can do research for free. If you're having trouble using them, well, as I said. Law is hard for the layperson. 




 Law is hard. You can't just google symptoms and get a sense of what the range of options is. Every case is different. Your options, how much you can recover, statutes of limitations, etc., all turn on the individual facts of your case, and moreover, it's not just what the facts are, but what facts you can prove and how you can prove them.

There are real reasons why lawyers licensed in jurisdiction A can't practice in jurisdiction B without getting admitted to the bar or being allowed to hire local counsel. The cynical, and partially accurate reason, is a monopolistic attempt by each state bar to protect local attorneys, but the other reason is that every state's laws and rules differ, and even in areas of law with a lot of similarities between states, it's easy to screw things up.

Saving yourself the legal equivalent of a callout and labor can quickly lead to completely screwing yourself and leaving you with no remedy or no defense (depending on which side you're on). 




 The customer isn't always right, but the customer is sometimes right. Had the exception been printed on the receipt as it was supposed to be, fine, but it wasn't. That's not on the customer. That's on the store. Shifting explanations to vague "health and safety" concerns would likely only make one more suspicious/angry.

You wrote "I'm getting a bit tired of her, and she's clearly just lying at this point", but it would have been perfectly reasonable for the customer to have been getting tired of you and thinking you were lying, given you claimed something could not be returned due to a clear policy on the receipt, that turned out to not be on the receipt.

Not your fault it wasn't on the receipt, not okay for her to yell at you, but even leaving aside your later comments/actions, the customer wasn't wrong to expect a return if the policy wasn't given to her.

 I don't understand how there hasn't been an immediate response from Congress to place compounding pharmacies under the auspices of the FDA, given the amount of harm NECC caused and the high possibility that it could happen with other compounding pharmacies.

This isn't to say that compounding pharmacies should have to follow all of the same requirements of manufacturingmanufacturing in large quantities poses much higher risks that what compounding pharmacies are supposed to be doing, namely creating 1 medication for 1 patient. But placing them under the umbrella of the FDA's regulation and giving the FDA the authority to inspect them, demand compounding pharmacies follow Good Manufacturing Practices, and the like should not be overly burdensome for small businesses.

I was at a T-intersection, where the road becomes two-lanes a few feet further on the right of the intersection, but traffic coming from the left is still one lane. A car to the left stopped and waved for me to go (since the traffic light a block up on the right was red). After checking for traffic coming from the right, I started to make my left turn at the T intersection, only to have a bumper-to-bumper strike on a car that went around the car that stopped for me on the left (slightly going over the double-yellow to pass). Neither of us could see the other based on lines of sight until getting past the stopped car where we collided.

Unfortunately, the only car that stopped was the one that hit me, not the person who stopped to let me in, and the driver of that car claimed to not have noticed passing a car.

Since I couldn't prove the other car was there and the other driver couldn't prove it wasn't, and since we had the same insurance company, the insurance co. said it was assigning fault equally. Not much damage to either car, scratches to the paint, really, but I'm still ticked off about this one.

Had I had a dash cam, I could have proven I was not at fault.

In the event of more serious incident, a dash cam can definitely be useful. 




 You have GOT to be kidding. Palestinians are NOT Israeli Muslims. One can argue about whether there is a distinct Palestinian identity or whether Palestinians are displaced Jordanians, but nobody credible on any side of the argument defines Palestinians as Israeli Muslims. 




 Employers can generally monitor company email at all times, but there ARE exceptions. If there is a published policy in place stating that the employer will not snoop in email except in certain circumstances, said employer cannot snoop in email except in certain circumstances.

All the comments here saying variants of "it's their server, they can do as they please" misses the issue. The issue is whether or not the deans in question fall into the category of faculty or not. If they are not faculty, then yes, the general staff policy allows Harvard to do as it pleases. If they are faculty, however, and there seems to be a strong case to be made that they are, the faculty policy seems to prohibits Harvard from taking the actions it did. 




 Um, it's almost certainly not the IT Department's policy, it's likely the law. 




 Dawww.... Very sweet looking. 




 Good grief-in my jurisdiction, removing a shopping cart from a store's property is a crime carrying a $25 fine, and there's legislation pending that would raise the fine to $100. 

I'm amazed the EC was stupid enough to complain that the carts she swiped were accumulating, and for that matter, I'd even be appalled if she was complaining that other people caused the accumulation. 




 Wow. I am impressed! (And my apologies for suggesting you erred.) 




 $5 each for the skittles or $50? (I'm trying to picture what $50 of skittles would be!) 




 Fortunately, it's not up to doctors. HIPAA requires giving patients access. 




 Depends. Some allergies can kill people. Others can make people pretty darn sick. (My mother is allergic to dairy products, and sadly, lactaid and other types of meds don't help.)

On the other hand, according to a 2008 article in the British Medical Journal, many "allergies" are actually a manifestation of mass psychogenic illness (AKA epidemic hysteria). http://christakis.med.harvard.edu/pdf/publications/misc/023.pdf If this article is accurate, it makes sense for food allergies to come in waves. 




 What is the process for writing the Rachel Maddow Show? What is the blend of direction from you versus from producers versus what your staff comes up with? What is the process for becoming a staff member? 




 It's state specific. In Massachusetts, some vehicle-related offenses are criminal, and some are Civil Motor Vehicle Infractions. See http://www.mass.gov/courts/courtsandjudges/courts/districtcourt/faq/faqs-cmvi.html#1 . 




 I disagree. The difference might be meaningful if judicial review down the line gave further process, such as a right to a de novo hearing somwhere along the way. It didn't. And so it creates a fiscal balance for due process in the civil arena, and not just in the administrative law arena. 




 Many, even most of the characteristics of a criminal charge? Sure. But it is still a civil violation, and therein lies all the difference in the world.

It's a civil matter, and just as in other civil contexts, there can be a filing fee. The state never pays a filing fee, but it's not exactly the initiator. (Not that it would matter if they were. To quote Mel Brooks, "It's good to be the King." The State doesn't pay filing fees. And why would it? Who would collect it? The State!) Anyhow, the initiating party, when it comes to this review process, is the person with a ticketit's an appeal.

How is Matthews on point? Because of the language I cited. The Massachusetts judicial system was (and is) underfunded, and the courts responded by putting a fee in place, both to raise revenue and cut down the amount of appeals. Unfair? Absolutely. Contrary to due process? I'd say so, but the Supreme Court doesn'tTHAT is the point of Matthews. Conserving scarce fiscal and administrative resources and balancing harm suffered to individuals versus the cost of providing due process.  




 Almost certainly not. Woman who received the package did not realize the package was misdelivered until after she opened it. Moreover, she did not lie about possessing it. She said she didn't have the package and she no longer had the package, both true statementsthe police had already come and taken it. 




 Violates ABA standards and the school could theoretically be penalized if it fails to penalize Cody Wilson. I doubt anything will come of it, but it was pretty stupid of Mr. Wilson to admit his skipping classes on the record. 




 I agree that it seems remarkedly unfair. Hell, it IS remarkedly unfair. But it's constitutional.

Matthews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), is a Supreme Court case that discusses the impact of finances in due process. The Court essentially comes out and admits that fairness and process can have a price tag attached. 

The Court says, "Financial cost alone is not a controlling weight in determining whether due process requires a particular procedural safeguard prior to some administrative decision. But the Government's interest, and hence that of the public, in conserving scarce fiscal and administrative resources is a factor that must be weighed. At some point, the benefit of an additional safeguard to the individual affected by the administrative action and to society in terms of increased assurance that the action is just may be outweighed by the cost."

(Before I get blasted or downvoted for laying this out, please note that I disagree with Matthews v. Eldridge, and I disagree that entry-level appeals of tickets to a clerk-magistrate should involve a non-refundable fee, but sadly, nobody in power asked me. :P) 




 Even if someone legitimately has a seizure-how does that translate to free food? You call 911, they check him out, take him to the hospital if need be, etc., where does free food come into the picture?

(I know, I know, I'm trying to understand insane troll logic, but just...erngh! The stupidity burns.) 




 Not necessarily. It really is a state-specific analysis. 




 Board of Education v. Earls (2002). Reading the majority opinion alone, it may not seem terrible, but compare the reasoning with that of its predecessor, Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton, which the majority supposedly relied on as precedent, and you'll see how the Court completely ignores all the key factors that made warrantless, suspicionless drug testing okay in Vernonia.

In Vernonia, the school had a real problem with drugs, limited the testing to student athletes who had unique safety concerns given the potential harm drugs could do to students with that level of exertion, involved a population that already was used to a lesser degree of privacy due to situations involving communal nudity (i.e. locker rooms) (and yes, this is a dumb argument in my view but still, not mere dicta to be ignored in future rulings the way the Court did in Earls!), etc.

Compare that reasoning, which the Court claims to rely to Earls, with the situation in Earls. In Earls, the school did NOT have a serious drug problem, it involved students involved in any extracurricular (and it's hard making a plausible argument that students in show choir or on a chess team present an elevated safety risk), and the unique lesser expectations of privacy of people used to locker room situations did not exist.

Instead, the Court took a South Park's Mr. Mackayian view of the situation, said "Drugs are bad, mmkay", and handwaved their way past precedent. O'Connor said as much in her dissent in Earls. (Well, minus the South Park reference.) 




 Yeesh. Glad to hear things worked out for you! I admire your restraint. 




 All the drama you can shake a stick at with very little authority to get much accomplished beyond throwing some social events. You'd be better devoting the time to being a staff member of a journal or brief. 




 Any advice may be state specific. Unfortunately, many, many states still permit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientationyou may not have a remedy if you complain and get fired. I suggest talking to a local plaintiff-side employment lawyer. 




 Yeah. She was going to steal it. Even had you not seen the box knife, her response suggests she was going to steal it. 




 I have to give you points. You called this one. 




 That looks delicious! Thanks for posting! 




 What's really scary is that the way you were treated is pretty much standard operating procedure, and its why false confessions can be such a big problem for the criminal justice system.

Put teens, or those with some form of mental issues, or even just scared adults in an interrogation room for many, many hours (sometimes double-digits), with police officers lying about what they know, intentionally or unintentionally coaching suspects with what the "right" answer, saying "just admit ____ and we can all go home", etc., and you end up with people falsely confessing to homicides, rapes, pretty much you name it. 




 I have the same set and I really like them. Cook's Illustrated rated them highly-it's why I bought them. 




 What are you used to? That's the only criteria that really matters.

When I was a JD student between '05-'08, the school was still majority PC but barely. Now that I'm back as an LL.M. student, I was surprised that the vast majority of laptops are macs. At least 70%ish. 




 A Restaurant Opportunities Centers United Report, admittedly a biased source but most sources are, claims that employers frequently fail to actually pay out more than $2.13 when tips are not high enough to bring an hourly wage to at least $7.25. (ROC-United, Behind the Kitchen Door: A Multi-Site Study of the Nations Restaurant Industry (BKD), 2011.) http://rocunited.org/2011-behind-the-kitchen-door-multi-site-study/ ) 




 Ad hominem attacks are not helpful, and your assumption that people tip at a constant 15% is a rather large assumption. Plenty of people don't tip-see http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/23/tipped-workers-left-out-as-minimum-wage-rises/ where a bartender talks about foreign tourists unaware of the custom.

Many servers DO make more than the $7.25 minimum wage. Many make at least around the $7.25 minimum wage. And a more useful point to make, which I should have conceded in my first post, is that the $2.13 wage is allowed only if tips bring up the total wage to at least the $7.25 minimum wage. BUT-reports claim that employers frequently fail to actually pay out more than $2.13 when tips are not high enough to bring an hourly wage to at least $7.25. (see ROC-United, Behind the Kitchen Door: A Multi-Site Study of the Nations Restaurant Industry (BKD), 2011.) http://rocunited.org/2011-behind-the-kitchen-door-multi-site-study/

Tipped workers are often forced to participate in a shared-tip pool, bringing down their total earnings, sometimes below $7.25 an hour. 

Restaurants with policies that make servers responsible for dine and dashers or for meals sent back can also reduce wages below $7.25 an hour.

The low minimum wage for tipped workers is one more reason for a gender pay gap. According to http://www.nelp.org/page/-/rtmw/ROC_GenderInequity_F1.pdf?nocdn=1 , non-tipped workers (minimum wage of $7.25) are 52% mage, while tipped workers are 66% female (with sub-minimum wage of $2.13). 




 This is unconscionable. The cost of bread, milk, public transportation, gas, etc., between 1991 and 2013? Heck, I was in second grade the last time the minimum wage for tipped workers was raised. I'm now an attorney. WTF? 









 The minimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13. It has stayed at $2.13 since 1991! (Since 1991, for non-tipped workers, the federal minimum wage has been raised five times and has gone from $4.25 in 1991 to $7.25.)

Think of how much bread, milk, gas, public transportation, etc. cost in 1991 versus now.

You don't have to tip for crappy service, but sequestration is NOT an excuse for not tipping. 




 Sometimes Reddit confuses me. Collective outrage at prosecuting Aaron Schwartz and cries for more exercise of prosecutorial discretion, but then in a thread like this, many suggestions that the authorities should intervene when a neighbor puts a note in another neighbor's mailbox. 




 I can't offer you legal advice, but you may want to consult with a lawyer in your jurisdiction. Generally, a false accusation of stealing is slander. 




 As _yours_truly_said, I would take a big grain of salt from the pessimistic attitude towards classmates and professors. The method can be worthwhile, as far as getting certain books and reading ahead to know the black letter bedrocks of subjects before the classes start. 




 Um, no? But if they are aware of a patron that is intoxicated to that extent, in many states, they may have certain legal duties to summon or render aid beyond placing a guy in the passenger seat of his car. 




 Fair enough. :-) 




 I can also imagine the liability if a bar did not do this and it had tragic consequences... 




 I'm a fan of personal responsibility and most of the blame falls on the dude who vomited everywhere and passed out. But. Doesn't some of the responsibility fall on the bar for overserving? (At least it would in some states.)

Also, if someone is that intoxicated, isn't a call to 911 more appropriate than dumping him in the passenger seat of his car? Alcohol poisoning can be fatal. 




 It's worth noting that according to USA Today, McMillan was indeed murdered and a person of interest is in custody. http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/02/28/gay-murder-mississippi-politics/1953187/
