 Your bot could keep some kind of database with entries for every user it encounters, and the link to their wiki page. I'm not sure how you would go about creating the wiki page, but your biggest problem would probably be retroactively adding users who posted their first post before the bot became active.

 I was driving home the other afternoon, as the sun went down. The light had begun to get redder, and the air to cool. I was feeling happy and relaxed, and then had a thought. What if sunsets are beautiful because it signifies another day survived? From an evolutionary perspective, we've evolved to feel good after surviving another day, which drives us to keep going. /notabiologist
