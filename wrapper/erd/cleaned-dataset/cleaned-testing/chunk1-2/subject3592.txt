 I get 6.98 MBPS here in Talbot :( 




 The union one has this system where if you work for an hour for them, they'll give you $10 worth of posters. And the work is simple -- hand out fliers or put posters back into their covers etc.  




 Yeah that's what I'm saying. Sometimes things will be fucked up. But that's not a reason to not try. 




 I just made the move, and things got fucked up royally...But while I'm hoping that things get better, I still don't regret doing it... 




 Sounds awesome...But $20 :(

Oh the concerts I'm not going to because of my "Penny wise Pound foolish" policy... 




 I just heard from someone, that it's better to be an asshole with integrity than a nice coward. That's of course, assuming the situation has given you only those choices. 

Otherwise, I completely agree with what you say. 




 Came here to say this -- Chinese Eggplant with Basil Sauce! 




 Maybe I missed something, but how did he know the "teenager" was texting? 




 I think BBC America releases it online the same day as the broadcast now. Not sure because I will be watching it on the 27th anyway. 




 Thank you...that makes sense! 




 Thanks! 




 While I don't agree with you, the fact that the photo doesn't convince you otherwise made me look at the photo critically.

I wanted to convey a feeling of vagueness and uncertainty through the photo. I'm not sure at all if that's coming through.. 









 I came here to say Turkey Run too. I've been camping there too.

Forest Glen is also a good option. If you want to go a little farther (4 hours), Shawnee National Forest is amazing. 




 I'm sorry, but I cried a little there. I wish you the best and hope you make it through. 




 Song of ice and Fire, LOTR, The foundation Series, The Hitchhiker's Guide books, the Space Odyssey Series by Arthur C. Clarke, and anything by Ursula LeGuin

EDIT: Must include Dune in the above list! 




 Been 2 hours, no reply yet. And I'm stuck at work for 2 more hours, so still waiting.. 




 Yeah thanks! I'm the one who's out right now. So I guess, I go back and face the music.. 




 And now I will learn the same lesson, I guess :) 




 Ooh thank you for your logic, LogicalSpider :D It helps that even though I chose email out of cowardice, there might be a small silver lining to it! 




 Oh believe me I tried. And it seems I do have a lack of balls, otherwise why wouldn't I have said anything for a year :) But we'll have to talk about it now...so hopefully the rejection won't be too cruel! 




 Yeah thats the impression I'm getting .. Oh well, my first time! 




 Oh no...I'm hoping we can continue to be friends...or it can't work like that? :O Shit..maybe I should have asked here before the email 




 Oh no, it was a reasonably long email explaining why I took so long and it ended with me saying that we should talk about it ... 




 Well I did say we should talk about it...So I get consolation prize at least .. 




 Yeah true. I did the former...and now it seems like a bad idea! 




 Shit...yeah...but it's been a year...Oh well .. 




 Well it was awkward for me for a long time...so I guess now it will go both ways :) 




 Some showers are good, some not so much I guess... 




 Thanks! 




 Outside 




 You would think  


That if you sat in the bath tub  
Long enough  
With the shower on in full force  


Hot water  
Slowly turning cold  


Your feelings  
All those crazy thoughts  
Would run down  
Your body  


And drain themselves  
With the water  


You would think that  
Wouldnt you?  


But let me tell you  
What really happens  


The water comes  
Hits you  
And then it goes  

  
Well, its water,  
What did you expect?  


Your feelings  
They stay where they are  
After the water is cold  
And you turn off the shower  


Youre the same as before  
Slightly cleaner maybe  
But the same.


 




 You can't replace the beatles drummer. He knew exactly what he was doing, what the song needed and what sounded best:

Example 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axb2sHpGwHQ
Example 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6tV11acSRk

If what you meant that any drummer can play the Beatles songs, then I agree with you. But the band drummer also comes up with the grooves and beats...I think Ringo was a perfect fit for them
 




 Very unusual and well written!  




 Tired, Burnt out  
Where do I go from here  


Hello rock  
Meet my bottom  
Ha ha ha  


Laugh  
Bass guitar plucks on my heart  
I laugh at the...  

The drums start  
Before I complete my thoughts  


Which are slower today  
Because you're in the other lane  
Coming towards me  
Your face going bigger  


I can see the shape of your breasts  
I don't want to look  
No I want to


Hello rock  
Meet my bottom  
Ha ha ha  
 




 Wow...wow..wow.

At first I thought -- Street drummer, is probably just going to play real fast and OP doesn't know anything. Well I'm off my horse! Real musical playing, awesome feel, lots of dynamics, brilliant rolls that aren't just straight Left Right Left Right, a right foot that has a mind of it's own .. a left foot that has brilliant sex the right hand ... 

He better be playing for a real band!! 




 That is way cool! 




 Yes..That was the intent. It was an unexpected moment and I found myself thinking about it days after it happened! 




 Thanks :) 




 
Smile
--------
Her hand was  
Covering her mouth  
As she turned up  
From her book  

And looked at me  
The edges of her lips  
Showed themselves  
From behind her knuckles  
And curled up  
Into a smile

I think the cafe was bright  
And one of the lights  
Was shining in her eyes  

The world stopped  
And then started again 




 Really nice! 




 My friends and I used to use such riddles to play a game. One guy would present a situation and everyone else would ask him question that he could answer only with "Yes", "No" or "Not relevant".

It sounds random, but we almost always got to the right answer within 30 questions. 




 Oh come on, that's just the shadow of the spaceship from Independence day 




 It supposedly works by taking many pics at once with varying degrees of focus, kind of like a compound eye. I wonder if it can zoom. 

Since there are so many mini-lenses, resolution is supposedly a problem. Hopefully they can work that out. 

Awesome concept, really! 




 Oh the Bengal ones sacrifice lots of animals. In the nepal animal sacrifice (which was recently banned, thankfully), thousands of animals are sacrificed at once.

Some of our customs have us cutting a pumpkin and putting red powder in them. This is nothing but a euphemized (okay that's not a word supposedly, but please let it pass) version of animal sacrifice. 




 Yeah, you're right of course :) 

However, it's also important that we don't really have a religious text. Some say the vedas are it (Sanathana Dharma), some say the Bhagavad gita is it (ISKCON), some say there's no text and we're awesome because of it (the moderate ones)....EDIT: To add, there are even some that say that we are not even a religion, only a way of life.  




 Because the facilities suck at all levels. I was in my undergrad team and we had a coach who didn't really care (he wasn't paid much at all, to be fair). Even then, when we once played against a "professional" (equivalent of the third division in other countries) club, we had better uniforms than them. They came to the field by public transport.

There's no money going into soccer. Two of the top clubs in the Indian subcontinent -- Mahindra United and JCT, disbanded recently because of a lack of money. LINK: http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110621/jsp/sports/story_14140274.jsp

And course there's the famous story of the Indian soccer team not going to the world cup because no one sponsored shoes for them. They qualified by default though. 



 




 Oh the caste system exists and is alive and well. People marry in the same caste. People kill for caste. People look away for caste. People get reservations for caste. People get votes for caste. Like you say, the exceptions (us, probably?) don't make the rules

And there are brahmins who eat meat religiously too (fish eaters in the coastal regions), though I agree, they are a minority. I'm a brahmin and I'm vegetarian :) 

Ninja EDIT : I mean, I WAS vegetarian :P 




 Yet there are Brahmins that eat fish (like I mentioned in a different comment). For every "rule" in Hinduism, you will probably find that the opposite is just as true. 




 No. It's religious. There's a lot of pain infliction in our religion. There's even animal sacrifice, though in general cows are left alone and considered sacred for some reason. 




 Umm...actually a lot of Hindus eat meat. Even among those that "do not", some eat fish and classify it as vegetarian. 




 Indian here. Sporting in India deserves a whole other discussion. The national level meets in our country have about as much support and facilities as high school meets here in the US. 




 The pleasures of a pope are none. 




 Depends on what makes you scream. 




 Hey reddit, what determines what kind of pasta will go into a recipe? They all seem to taste the same to me...

I like experimenting with food, so it might help to learn to see the difference! 




 Oh I'm 28 too, don't like what I'm doing, am in a ForeverAlone phase and have no clue what I want to do.

Not sure that helps you in anyway, but if you need company, I'm here! 




 This thread maybe useful:

 Was this actually posted on some news site or is it more like a warning? 




 Descent!!!! Many hours were spent playing this!

I never made it past Level 9 in Descent 2 without cheat codes. Couldn't find the bloody red keycard! Ten years and I still remember it, was a very traumatic experience!

 I'm not american or extremely knowledgeable, but this article still made me sad. It reminds me of the way I'm angry with my advisor (I'm in grad school), but still have to suck up to him sometimes.

 I can't submit comments while using RES on Chrome. I have to start Firefox (don't have RES installed on that) to comment. DAE have this problem? Is there a fix?

 Thank you very much :) 




 Aah..I don't really have an explanation for this. I was looking at/thinking of the sky when I wrote it -- I'm not sure that helps! 




 Thanks! I'll try to post more poems...hoepfully will get feedback on them as well! 




 Oh really good advice! Reading the poem again, I agree with you completely about the claims to pain and torture, especially the narrow perspective.

Unrelatedly, I don't see how honesty and being-a-dick are related, and you're completely in the former zone! 




 The sky is grey

The morning is blue

There's a knot in my stomach

I'm thinking of you


There's no sense in this

The torture, the pain

There's no question if it's worth it

Because I have nothing else

To be worth anything



In my head

I'm fading out

Losing meaning

Each day

I am less than I was

The day before
 




 Who?  




 Whenever I've seen people fishing, it's been with kids :) Though I've seen them catching fish continuously...

 There's Homer Lake (Urbana - 20 mins away) and Lake of the Woods (Champaign - 20 mins away) and Clinton Lake (30 mins away) all of which offer fishing. I've seen many people fishing in Homer Lake for sure. Don't know if you need a license...

There's Kickapoo State Park (30 mins) and Turkey run (90 mins) if you're looking to do some Kayaking/Fishing/Boating/Camping

 Hey, 

Sorry for the late reply, but I would totally be up for next semester. I have an electronic drumkit since I live in an apartment..

I am into pretty much everything, from metal to pop and a little bit of hip hop. These days, I'm listening to a lot of jazz and reggae though I haven't really played anything like it. 
 
Really, any kind of music will do. I just want to actually play with people instead of the computer.

 That just means that she wasn't running as fast she could have without falling down. 




 I'm a reddi. I was born reddi.

On further thought, I may have stopped a sentence halfway there. I tend to  




 Yesterday evening, I realized reddit was the greatest website ever when I saw that these two things were on the same page:

1. The hottest youtube video I've ever seen: [Hot youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs8YthlglKk)

2. An AMA with an astronaut: [Astronaut AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gm8rh/iaman_astronaut_who_has_been_to_space_twice_and/)

So the two most important things in life for me were in the same place at the same time...Couldn't ask for much more in a day! 


P.S : I'm still new to the whole reddi 




 Actually, the poem was written in three paragraphs with the same lines as above. When I pasted it onto reddit, the formatting disappeared, and I couldn't get the paragraphs to work.

However, when I reread it, I saw that the paragraphs weren't really adding anything in the sense that everything I wanted to say, I was still saying, so I let it be.

I'm no poet though and I don't know the rules. I just press Enter when I feel a pause in my thoughts to start a new line :) 




 That's a nice quote. I'm no Hemingway, though I could be the boy. Or the fish :) 




 They are an actual wolf and an actual stuffed monkey, not metaphors or anything :)

Thanks! 




 On the sand

By Michigan Lake

And in the forest

By the sand

I thought

Of holding your hand

And walking with you

Instead of beside


After I moved a log

To make way for the queen

I buried my hands

In my sweatshirt

And played with

The lighter



Yes, the same lighter

That refused

To light our cigarettes

And robbed me of that moment

Where I would be sitting with you

Smoking by the lake

Listening to the clamour of the waves




In the curiously romantic

Silence of winter brown trees

I burned your

Stuffed monkeys tail

And felt the

Pleasant distraction

Of the heat on my palm.



You stopped

In your tracks

To look for the wolf



I looked at you

And lit the flame

on my palm again

---

This is my first poem post here...please criticize freely! 




 Ok wow. I was going to post something similar - actually the same thing. I'm doing my PhD in Aerospace and am currently extremely frustrated. Then I found this...The replies are awesome. Instead of a problem being my first post on reddit, it's a Thank you! 
























 Makes sense...Thanks! 




 It's not hard...I just like to leave the shirt untucked because it gets that way through the course of the day anyway. 




 I've recently tried to graduate from zippered sweatshirts to cardigans/sweaters. The problem is that I like to leave my shirts untucked.

If I do however, the part of the shirt below the sweater looks like a skirt. Is this conventionally acceptable, because I think it looks silly :-/

Should I stuff in the shirt under the sweater or something? If I tuck it in and then tuck it out later, it comes out all wrinkled. 

Any advice will be appreciated!

EDIT: Well, the internet seems to tell me that if my shirt is long enough to be looking like a skirt, it should be tucked in anyway! What do you guys think? 




 Yeah...exactly.

The last few years have taken away a lot from me. I'm prepared to spend many years getting it all back, even if I have to do it one step at a time.

Whenever you feel like you can't go on, just let a few days go by. The weather will change or a grocery store girl will smile at you...I never can tell when it begins and when it ends. When it ends, I exercise... 

Very glad to be of help... 




 I am new to this subreddit, but only because I didn't know it existed.

Reading through it gives me so much hope. 

To the people who post their problems here:

I am truly inspired today by your courage to lay your heart out on reddit and take advice. This gives me hope about me, and tells me that no matter what I'm feeling, there are always people who will care.

Thank you. 




 I tried again and again for 4 years before finally giving up on trying to be confident. After 8 months of soul-wrenching self-reflection and a reasonable amount of hurting myself, I decided the following:

I'll make a small change, and stick to it. I won't worry about any other problem. I can't work? It's okay. I can't sleep? It's okay. I am disappointing people who think the world of me? It's okay. The world sucks and the girl I love is fucking someone else? It's okay. I just turn the other cheek and let the world slap me there. I am a loser and by definition, losers don't win. That's okay too.

As long as I can exercise regularly, everything else doesn't matter. The hope is that once I'm able to exercise regularly, I can take the next step. And some days, I can't get out of my bed. That's fine too. I'll just let those days go by and wait for the day I get out and go to gym.

The point is the hope, of course. Exercise gives me endorphins and for all I know, the endorphins might be what's letting me live.

I post to r/Fitness and get encouragement from there. I see stories on reddit and I laugh. 

I'm not sure what I'm trying to say to you any more. But I went through all that you did. Maybe not or maybe my situation was worse, we can never be sure. But remember it does not matter that others think of you as a failure. 

I am afraid sometimes that my family will see me for what I am and their hopes will come crashing down. But these days, I have learned to accept that too. I am what I am. This acceptance sometimes make me smile and sometimes it makes me punch walls. 

But whatever I am, I will exercise regularly and then sleep well, and then dress well. And then we'll see. Fuck everything else.

I'm not sure I'm getting my point across at all, but I hope your understanding is better than my expression. 




 The hurting is in the front of the kneejoint, especially when I'm climbing stairs.

Thanks for your advice about the stretches. I was doing only general stretches, but will include these specific ones as well. 




 Relevant username? :D 

Okay...I guess I'll take you on your word and try! 




 I have two questions...I'm not exactly new to r/Fitness, but this seems to be the thread where I can ask basic questions freely!

1. I used to be a competitive runner about 6 years back in school (400 m, 800 m, 2000 m and 5000 m), but then I stopped. I started again a few weeks back. I run 3 times a week, 3-5 miles in each run, with an average pace of 7:30 per mile (8 mph). 

The problem is that my knees are hurting. I've just attributed it to not running for a long time, but the pain hasn't gone in 3 weeks. Is this normal or should I be worried?

2. I see squats being recommended over and over. But I don't have a partner and I am not confident of my squatting form. Will I get the same advantages if I use the squatting machine at the gym?

I'm a grad student in university, so have access to good equipment. 




 Thank you all who commented! I will be listening to all of these tomorrow.

 I don't have answers to any of those questions :) 




 I know...thanks :) 




 I would tend to agree with the general gist of your comment, especially the part where I'm putting in more effort than her. But changing that requires changing me, which is a lot of effort...

Well, I am going to take your advice to heart and we'll see how it goes! 




 Sort of..we're flatmates :) 




 I would like to say I don't have enough strength to do that. Circumstances too...but well! 




 No...Circumstances prevent the stopping of hanging out to this day. It's been six months now and I'm very tired now. Where are the other women?! 




 I physically proposed the act and she didn't talk to me for a day. I verbally proposed the act and she didn't talk to me for a week and even cited said physical proposal as a sign of my betrayal.

 Also, I will be there. If you come in, and shout "Reddit!" in a loud voice, I will buy you (or the first person to do this) a beer. 




 Esquire in downtown Champaign has no cover and a live band. 




 Reading through the rest of the comments, I wish this was at the top. I believed strongly in the article till I read this comment. This goes with everything I've learned about nutrition as well. 

I wish they had done a more long term study with more gradual weight loss.
 




 "Put down the damn fork" believe me, is easier for some people than others.  




 No. I think the point is that what you call "lack of effort" is rooted in genetics. While some people use it an excuse, it is unfortunately very true for others.

I think of it in the same terms as depression. What you're doing is equating depression to a bad day. 




 Wow...Can't believe I searched the rest of reddit and missed Fitness...

I see that this article has been submitted to r/science (http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/nuhrp/a_full_year_after_significant_weight_loss_these/) and health...but I subscribe more to this subreddit, and would like to see responses to this thread here. 




 I don't know...If the enemy is dropping pamphlets during a war, which government would want their people to read them?

 Oh wow...I stand completely corrected!! An internet apology and thank you to you, kind sir/madam. 




 Thanks! You have now given me specific words to go find the meaning of...Off I go! 




 I did say "rest of the internet", didn't I? Google is it, and I asked.

While I showered in the torrent of information, I came out only wet, not cleaner.

It's more reliable to ask a forum where people seem to know what they're talking about. 

 




 I'm getting conflicting opinions both on this subreddit and on the rest of the internets. Some say they exercise only the arms and some say pushups are an awesome all-round bodyweight exercise.

Which is true? I have a feeling the truth lies somewhere in between...but well, I can't build my exercise routine only on feelings.

Thanks! 




 My mother is a yoga teacher, and I've heard her talk about this:

There are two different schools of Yoga (I'm not sure what either is called, so I won't take names):

1. Stretch as much as you can - This means go only to the extent you feel slight tension in and then hold that pose. Don't push yourself. You'll eventually get to the point where your heels are on the ground. 
2. Use "props" - This could be a something under your heels so that they are resting. Maybe a pillow. Anything.

I don't know for myself which is better. My mom teaches yoga the first way, so that's how I do it. You'll get better at Yoga the more you do it. 




 The study talked about cancer and heart disease. Is that all health is these days? 




 i know this is probably not the answer you're looking for, but it did work for me: Try to enjoy cooking. Look at it as part of your fitness routine. It is also a lot of fun and very interesting to try out various things.

Start with simple things and keep expanding. I used to cook once a week, and now I cook almost daily and keep trying new things. Of course, I don't make anything that takes longer than 20-30 minutes, but there's a whole world of cooking hidden in that time frame too. 




 To be fair, my mom went against her religious beliefs and out of her way to make sure we got protein through eggs in our diet. She'd never even touched eggs before in her life and still cooked it for us for breakfast.

 




 Came to say this. But then saw it said and realized I don't really like the joke. Sorry HighSorcerer!

The written word truly is different. 




 Ah..Shit! 




 I don't know. I like Sex better than Racing though. 




 That doesn't look half as bad as I thought it would. 




 How was your year? 
 




 About the reason for eating this way: I really have never considered health. My mother is a dietitian in India. She's strictly vegetarian for religious reasons, but allowed us (my brother and me) to eat eggs because she realized as sportsmen, we would not get enough protein otherwise. Come to think of it, she also used to give us Vitamin B-12 capsules regularly. She also did tell me recently that for the amount of lentils and beans we eat (approx 0.5 cups per day) plus the beans and the eggs, she was making sure that we got enough protein as kids. 

While I was not religious at all, vegetarianism stuck with me mainly out of inertia. 

When I went to Singapore once, I was out with friends and had steak and loved it. So I plunged headlong into meatland with gleeful abandon!

However, I am also a poor graduate student. So, I don't eat out very often (i.e. I cook at home) and I don't know enough about cooking meat. And meat is more expensive in grocery stores, so vegetarian it is. I started working out in earnest recently and hence this thread!

Though as I write this, I am having delicious prosciutto with fresh mozzarella and basil.

Sorry for the long reply...Am a little drunk and happy with  my cooking!

Also, thank you for the advice on supplements! I will buy some whey protein next time I visit a grocery store! 




 Thank you! This makes perfect sense! 




 Yes, I'm looking it up...

Look at this article: http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/you-illuminated/201102/does-vegetarianism-make-you-dumber

Though this is about memory...Seems Creatine does not help memory in omnivores, but increases it in vegetarians! Crazy shit!

EDIT: And a similar trend for bodybuilding/exercise: http://www.vrg.org/journal/vj2003issue4/vj2003issue4weight.htm

"Vegetarians have lower levels of creatine in their blood, urine, and red blood cells.21,18 This does not necessarily mean that they have lower levels in skeletal muscle, which is where it most matters during exercise. In one study, vegetarians and meat-eaters took 7 g of creatine three times a day for six days. The vegetarians' power output over three bouts of exercise improved significantly after the six days of supplementation, while it did not change for the meat-eaters.18 In another study of vegetarians, creatine supplementation did not improve power output.22

Generally, a daily total of 20-30 g of creatine, broken up in smaller doses over the course of a day and taken for five to six days, has been shown to increase performance.17 There appears to be no benefit of taking this dose for longer than six days.17 After the initial "loading" phase, 2 g/day maintains creatine levels for at least one month.17 Some researchers suggest taking creatine only every other month to maximize its effects.10" 




 I don't even know that word! But off I go to Google...Thanks! 




 I am mostly vegetarian. By mostly, I mean I eat meat only once in a while, maybe once a week and I was completely vegetarian till a year back.

I am also Indian, which for my diet means I eat a lot of vegetables, lentils and rice. I was always told my required protein comes from lentils and eggs. So I assumed I had everything required for a healthy life from a vegetarian diet.

Looking at some threads on this subreddit however, has given me the impression that I still might need supplements.

Vitamin B-12? I'd never even thought about that before, though someone said milk which I get enough of, I'm sure.

Is there anything else I should be worried about, especially since I started exercising regularly and reasonably intensely (mainly running 5 miles, rowing 2000 m and some dumbbell exercises 3-4 times a week)?
 




 Yeah, I don't want to read the logs either. I just want to have a way of knowing when I move from home to office if I've missed a message.

Chrome does that very well with the Google Talk extension.  









 I didn't realize the mistake there, and kept wondering how the first sentence and the rest were connected! 




 Yes, I have to agree...MFA is a great influence indeed! Thanks to this amazing subreddit, I'm now wearing clothes that fit, and thinking about what I'm going to wear depending on where I'm going! 




 Somehow, your amazingly weird analogy makes perfect sense! 




 In that first link, Beckham looks like he's wearing a towel :O That's supposed to look good? Even if it is, no way I have enough confidence to carry that off.

The second one's cool...

Thanks...that did help! 




 I need some guidelines on wearing a scarf. I've figured out the knots, etc. after watching a few youtube videos, and have on basic question:

Does the scarf go inside or outside the jacket?

Okay two: (How) Does the answer to the above depend on what I'm wearing? 




 Oh I had completely forgotten about the Google Talk Gadget...Thanks! 




 I really like empathy too, but I also like the ability of Google talk to automatically sync chat logs as I'm chatting between my laptop, home and office computer.

I used empathy for a few weeks before I realized that if I forget to sign off at home (which I always do), I miss everything that's said till the time I get to the office, unless I open up GMail and look in the Chats folder.

I know I'm griping about really small issues, but it would be cool if it all worked. And it seems like it should!  




 I recently switched back to Firefox because it looks and feels so much better on Gnome. 

The only thing missing is a Google Talk extension. I don't want to open up a page of GMail because I have thunderbird running all the time anyway. Chrome has a Google talk extension available that runs in the dev version with panels enabled. 

Are there any alternative solutions for Firefox? 




 Also, looking for deals on the Transformer always gets me more results on Transformer toys.  




 Oh shit, me too!  




 I did nothing all year. 




 The version on the album is more than 9 minutes long...and when listened to as part of the whole album, is a completely different listening experience. 




 This be very good advice. Going to class and doing homework not only lets you learn better, but also gives you good work ethic.

I took the easy road in undergrad, which has made my current road very thorny indeed. 




 I really can't get myself to do it. Was supposed to be coding, but here I am...I've lost my whole week :D I installed StayFocusd on Chrome and Leechblock on Firefox. The extensions lasted about two days before being disabled!

And I'm sure I'm not the only one. 

Part of the problem is that my work depends only on me and how much I can motivate myself. But I'm sure there are still solutions. 




 Yup...doing that right now! 




 That was unexpectedly pleasant! 









 So it happened again tonight as well? The power plant must be going full swing for the winter...  




 Yeah that's what I'm thinking too...But then it must be hell for the people close to there! 




 Does anyone else hear that loud continuous noise that's been on for the last hour or so? I thought it was the wind, but when I opened the balcony door, it sounded more like a big engine.

 




 I would love to exchange stuff too...Email ID pritamps+writing@gmail.com 









 Really? That's complicated Math? That's some of the most beautiful concepts you can find expressed in a cool, simple form...
 




 Well, Mint's numbers are higher on distrowatch, so it's a reasonably good rumor to believe.

Distrowatch numbers don't mean anything of course, so I would tend to agree with your statistics. 




 I posted this question when I was new to reddit, and didn't get any karma. It made me hate everyone. 




 I have light grey jeans...thanks! :) 




 I really thought for a moment I could pull them off! Guess it's going under shirts, then! 




 By pants, I mean jeans and Dockers Khakis... 














 Was talking to my friend in Miami who has a motorbike and complaining that I really wanted one. She said we should do a motorcycle trip. 

So in 3 days, I rented a motorcycle from Chicago, rode to the Smokies and back alone. I didn't have a jacket and I didn't have glasses (for the first seven hours before i finally gave up and bought a $5 pair at a gas station). She and friends rode from Miami and we met at the Smokies and did "The Tail of the Dragon".

My eyes were red, my skin first chilled to the bone and then burned and chapped. Best trip :D

 




 This is how I read this:

1. Oh nice, a guy got a homeless guy fried chicken.
2. What? The homeless guy was black? He got a black homeless guy fried chicken? So? 
3. Wait? *Reads the status again* He didn't say the homeless guy was black? 
 




 Are you currently a backpacker?

Yes. But never longer than 2-3 days.

 Do you know how to use your equipment well and repair it if needed?

I can use it, but can't repair it.

 Do you know basic first aid, especially for blisters?

Nope :) I guess my preparation has to point in a different way!  

Great advice on the rucksacks walks. I've done lots of hikes with heavy weights, but never trained. This is a good time to start, then.

 




 My goal is to stay healthy, and fit enough to do the Appalachian Trail in 4 months two years from now. However, I have very little knowledge of the Science of fitness and my regime is based only on personal experience of the following:

1. Playing sports all my life (Soccer mainly). I was a competitive swimmer as a kid and a member of my collegiate athletics team in India (long distance)
2. Yoga. My mother is a yoga teacher and I learnt the basics (only) from her.

This is my new fitness regime. Please criticize freely! I alternate days because I was told I should not do the same exercises on consecutive days.

** Days 1,3,5 : **
 
1/ Run 4-6 miles (It's been 6 years since I've run, so I run at the slow pace of about 8:30 per mile)

2/ Row 2000 m (in about 10 minutes) 

3/ If I feel like it, I swim a little and pay a visit to the sauna.

4/ Stretch. 

**Days 2,4,6 :** 

1/ Yoga for stretching (about 20 minutes). 

2/ Push ups (I am currently on 60 in sets of 12-15) 

3/ Sit-ups (On 70 in sets of 12-16).

Then I repeat. I use runkeeper and android apps for the pushups/situps. That's about it. Like I posted before, I have never really used gym or machines before, so any suggestions, help will be greatly appreciated!
 




 That makes perfect sense! I will try squats, deadlifts, etc.. and post again for more feedback.

Thank you! 




 I've grown up doing a variety of athletic activities and exercises, but I never really had access to a gym. 

Now I do, and what I want to know is this: 

What advantage the machines in the gym (and weights) offer over say push-ups, sit-ups and pull-ups, which I regularly do anyway. They do look like fun and I see that a lot of people are really into it, which must mean there's solid reasons for it!

 




 I'm going back now to see this girl you speak of! 




 I just saw the guy. He's pretty boring. 




 I will be dare  
I will be dare   
To be there!
 




 I am a graduate student. I live paycheck to paycheck and I currently owe my friends+brother about $6000. I make $900 or $1700 per month depending on the semester and what course I'm teaching.

Most of that money goes in rent. I have no car and don't eat out to save money, which means I've become one mean cook! 




 Ah...I see your point. So I came up with a clever line where it wasn't relevant...shit. 




 Well, independent story. I was the Instructor for an Engineering course and caught 6 Indians cheating. I am an Indian too and I cheated when I was an undergrad too. 

However, they still got zero credit for their assignments. 

**tl;dr**: Rules are rules when you have to enforce them. When you have to follow them, use your judgement! 




 I really can't believe someone's complaining that their girlfriend wants to have sex.

NotAlone Problems -- Stranger to ForeverAlones than FirstWorldProblems are to ThirdWorldPeople 




 She isn't really that impressive or stylish :-| Just more impressive than Bad Romance indicates 




 I don't know why there's such a backlash against violence. You didn't mean any humiliation with your slap, only retribution. Violence, like everything else is good in moderation.

Her cheek will heal, you'll have your revenge and everyone will laugh at it two weeks from now.
 




 I like ketchup on the side...not in things. 

Ketchup with fries = good
Ketchup on burger = NO
Ketchup on Chicago Hot Dog = NO WAY! All those other things go so well together. I can't imagine why anyone would imagine adding ketchup is a good idea!
 




 This is only for rich people to say. 




 Okay that just made my day, night and week. Have been thinking similar things all of the last few months, but I guess Neil Gaiman just says it better. 




 I'm south Indian. I don't hate north Indians. And the ones I don't hate, don't hate me. 




 There's a bus which goes to Iowa City

https://www.burlingtontrailways.com/

Costs $56 round trip...Not sure about amtrak! 




 Just curious. I came to the first world from the third world and while I would laugh at all the silly problems "those guys" would have when I was there, I think they're all very real problems when I'm here!

Well, some of are funny, of course. But most of them seem like real first world problems to me. Is it just the fact that they're not problems in the "third" world that makes them funny? Because when I face the problem (like going to pee when I'm already asleep on a comfortable bed), I don't laugh at the fact that I didn't think this was a problem before, because it is one now!
