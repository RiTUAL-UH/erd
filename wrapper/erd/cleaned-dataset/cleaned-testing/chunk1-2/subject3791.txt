 Hmm, where is that? I'm using KitKat also (AOKP ROM). 




 Just tried that. Blocks calls fine, but messages gets through. 




 What, in your opinion, is the best way to completely block unwanted calls / SMS of unknown / unwanted callers?

I'm using Call Filter. The problem is that it doesn't block the call, it just rejects it (like pressing No/red button). So, if i'm near my phone, i can see the screen going on. Also, my provider sends me a text message of a missed call (cause, you know, that what he thinks this is, after Call Filter rejection). So, i get notified no matter what.

As for the SMS messages, i"m yet to find a way to block them. Call Filter doesn't block, they get through. The only way is by mutting the conversation on Hangouts. But i get to see the message eventually, so that's not a solution.

Any solution is more than welcomed.

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: I'm using a Galaxy Nexus with Android 4.4.2 KitKat.

Spyros Panagiotis Skouras was born on 27 September, 1892 at Skourahorian, Greece, the son of a local sheepherder. After initially studying for the priesthood, Skouras, with the help of his older brother, [error], joined his younger brother, George P. Skouras, and traveled to America. While working as a bus boy in St. Louis, Skouras would spend his nights studying English, business practices, accounting and law. In 1912 the three brothers pooled their money and purchased a rundown nickelodeon in a poor neighborhood in St. Louis. After turning the theater around the brothers were able to build on their success and borrow $150,000 to buy and refurbish the old Grand Central Theater in St. Louis. Eventually the Skouras brothers would go on to control 650 theaters spanning coast to coast.

Skouras, along with his brother George joined the Army Signal Corps during the First World War. After the war they returned to St. Louis and their theater interests.

The Skouras brothers sold their theater franchise in 1928 to Warner Brothers where Skouras and his younger brother George were made officers in the company. Charles Skouras went on to become president of National Theaters Inc. In 1931 Skouras left Warner's to work for Paramount and the following year was lured away to take over Fox Metropolitan Theaters in New York, which was loosing a million dollars a year. He was able save the franchise from bankruptcy and by 1942 was in a position to take over the presidency of 20th Century-Fox. During his tenure as president Skouras is credited with embracing cinemascope technology in an attempt to save the movie industry from the growing competition from television. By early 1960s, mounting losses compounded by the 30 million over-budget production of Cleopatra (1963), led to Skouras being forced out. He remained on as chairman of the board though, retiring in 1969 to devote more time to his shipping line business, Prudential -Grace Lines.

Skouras died of a heart at his home in Mamaroneck, NY on 16 August, 1971. He was survived by his wife of 51 years, the former Saroula Bruiglia, two daughters and two sons.

 Contacts+ already have access to SMS messages, but, because it's a wifi tablet, these apps doesn't support SMS functionality.

I'm looking for something like Market Helper i think that could be a solution for installing SMS apps and allowing access to pushed messages.

http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2146216

I don't want to use Market Helper, since it's asking for some Google permissions that i don't know what they do (so, it's a security concern for me). 




 So, Pushbullet is successfully mirroring my SMS messages from my Nexus 5 to my Nexus 7 2013 (WiFi edition). But, since it's a wifi edition, i don't have an app to view them and can only view the message from the notification (Evolve SMS is not compatible, Contacts+ wont show it's SMS features).

Is there any solution for that?

Thanks!

 Something like that I guess..  




 Yes. They are unable to do something about it.

The only way I found that blocks them is the "I'm under attack mode" on Cloudflare. It totally blocks them. But if I turn it off (or set it to any other mode) they just come back..

And Cloudflare is unable to help me more, if I don't pay for a premium subscription... 




 Yes, I'm using WordPress, secured in many ways. 









 Nope, only GETs. 




 There is. They are accessing my homepage. Some stop there, some others access content on my wp-content/uploads and wp-content/themes. That's all. they like. Mostly images.

Others stop when accessing my pixel.gif, which i have created by following http://kb.site5.com/security/how-to-block-bots-that-dont-respect-your-robots-txt-file/. They don't get block, they just stop. 




 Unfortunately, yes. 




 I have blocked several countries using Cloudflare, so every visitor from these countries must now complete a captcha to proceed. They are unable to (since, i guess, they are bots) and i'm now on sustainable levels, but this is not a solution. Every country that is not blocked keeps on hitting me.

Nope, no exploits on my site. 




 Hello everyone. Starting yesterday, i'm facing a major problem with my website: even though, for the last 3 months, i was having a very small number of visitors (most of them from my country), the number exploded yesterday and now i'm getting several hundreds of hits. This could have been a good thing, if they werent real visitors acting like bots.

So, here is the pattern:

- Hits from every country imaginable, from multiple IPs. If i block their country using Cloudflare, they dont come back (so they are unable to solve a captcha).
- Analyzed some of the IPs, they seem legitimate, no spam or bot records, nowhere.
- Each and everyone of these IPs has a useragent in the lines of Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.11; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64;
Trident/6.0. Some of them have different versions of MSIE or Trident. But they all have this agent.
- Every hit is to my index page. I believe that some of them hit my naked domain, because i see a redirect. They get to my main page, and from there, some of them, hit a few .js, .css or images. But the majority does nothing, stays for 0 seconds and leaves.
- Hosting provider cant help, since they believe that all those hits are from legitimate visitors (so, someone wants to convince me that users from Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore, Senegal, Iraq etc suddenly type the address of my greek blog to their browsers, pay a visit of 0 seconds and the leaves. Nah...).
- No refferal, since they are all direct hits.

This is causing me problems, since im on a limited shared hosting account. They also hit my Adsense (no hits, just impressions), so i decided to remove it temporarily (in case Google blocks it for malware activity and fake hits).

The only thing i could associate with this situation is some hits im getting from a bot. They are a distributed computing project, so they
might direct all those IPs to my site. I contacted them (waiting for
answer) and blocked their bot using robots.txt. No difference.

Some of the hits from my logs:

- 46.130.101.177 - - [05/Jul/2014:12:01:28 +0300] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301
138 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1;

138 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.11; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64;

- 78.174.87.179 - - [05/Jul/2014:12:09:15 +0300] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200
20742 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.11; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64;
Trident/6.0)" 

You get the pattern. There is a long list that looks like this.

Has anyone else experienced this situation? Is there a solution?

Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance. 















































































 Sorry. Been having this problem with sharing links from Verge using my tablet. They should implement an automatic redirection. 














 "New icons, including a beautiful new launcher icon. The rest of the icons on your home screen will be jealous of its good looks. They will plot to get rid of it. They will scheme in the night, when your screen is off. They will try to convince you to just leave it in the app drawer, or relegate it to a distance home screen page you rarely visit. Don't let them do that - you know that Trello is the one you want, no matter what the other apps say."

 That's right, that's what i told. Link Bubble allows you to share the bubble without even opening it, something that saves me tons of time. ;)

But Javelin looks promising. If it implements a way to share bubbles faster, maybe i'll use it as my main browser. 




 Just tried javelin. It's good but, from what I see, you are not able to quickly share a page by dragging the bubble to another bubble. You have to open the full browser page, then open menu, go to share etc. Am I wrong?
