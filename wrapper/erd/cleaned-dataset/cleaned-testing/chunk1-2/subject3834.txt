 Yep.  I'm loving how easy the BB onebro run is so far in comparison, though I know some parts end game are gonna be much togher :D 




 Is the auto record always set on by default?  Because it seems like it is, as I notice that when I go to the share menu, there always seems to be a video recording, and it gives me the option of "save this video clip."  I never realized it was on from the jump I guess, it just seems kinda obtuse, and I thought the menu was just wonky. 




 Right now it's Heynryk, cuz that bastard killed the crow lady on my level 4 BeastBro runthrough, and I was really counting on getting that Hunter Oath rune from her to help the waste of skin build not suck ass.  The other Oath runes fuckin suck, and this guy is a dick.  My viscerals only do like, 100 damage with a +4 hunter's axe, he has a couple thousand HP, and he one or two shots me with either his pistol or cleaver.  Ahem.  Did I mention what a dick he is? 




 So, doing it the way you mention doing it (double tapping to start, and letting it just go on its own) you have to be careful then to make sure you save the footage you want, if say, you reach the end of a 15 minute loop, because then it will start recording over that original loop?  Thanks. 




 When people refer to monsters, yes, one-shot is the instagib, but when a lot of players say it in regards to boss fights, they mean they beat it the first time around.  Speaking of which, I just one-shotted the cleric beast and papa G on my current 4bro (lowest level you can be) run-through.  I think I forgot papa G, who sucked, but I did record the cleric beast fight (if I worked it properly).  Will try and figure out this PS share crap and upload it soon.

Edit:  goddammit.  Looks like I recorded 15 minutes before the cleric beast, but not the actual cleric beast fight.  Still have yet to figure out these annoying share features on PS4   So is it double tap "share" button to start recording?  And double tap it again to stop recording? 




 That is way too much work.  I also one-shot killed Gherman in like, 60 seconds on NG+.  He is so easy to parry, and with +30% and +20% clawmark ruins, he died in like, 4 viscerals  :D 




 Really?  That's kind of shitty.  Can I expect the same solid performance once they fix it?  Or from the next one? 




 Ok - so I've had this PS4 for a few months, hardly used it before BB was released, I've never shut it down improperly, never dropped or damaged it in any way, and I think it's only gone into rest mode once or twice, and out of the blue it initiated in a weird loop when I started it up today.  I am currently googling potential fixes and what not, but any suggestions or known fixes in the mean time?  Thanks in advance for your replies.  This is pretty damn disappointing for an expensive piece of hardware :/


Edit:  I tried starting the PS4 in safe mode, but it won't even do that.  I'm stumped...


Edit:  It's seemingly now on, with the PS4 noises/music playing in the background, but my input screen on the TV (HDMI2) is blinking repeatedly on and off, but it isn't staying on enough to display an image or menu.  I know both inputs on the TV work fine, as I have already tested them.  Not sure what to do or where to go from here.


Edit edit:  Found a fix that worked!  The problem lay somewhere in between the TV itself, the input channel, and it's communication with the PS4.  I followed the instructions below, and it seemingly cleared up the issues, and now the input channel is staying on, and BB is loaded up and ready to play.  Thanks for your input  :)

1- Power off TV

2- Unplug TV from outlet

3- Press and hold in the power button on the TV for 30 seconds (while it is unplugged from the wall)

4- Release the power button

5- Plug in the TV into a different outlet

6- Power the TV back on 




 Eh. With how OP you could easily make your gear in DaS 2, the difficulty spike wasnt as noticeable. BB seems more akin to the leap in DaS, but the jump is less and less noiceable, especially as you learn the game and get better at it. I definately felt the pain a bit through NG+, but I'm In NG++ right now and have one-shot every boss so far, and am currently on my way to go kill darkbeast Paarl and then the shadows. Even in chalice dungeons at depth 5, I'm finding hot dogs and undead giants and ebriaites ridiculously easy to one shot.  Now I'm sad, because I'm worried I'll bore of this game quicker than the other titles...  Will probably wind up doing a level 4 run sooner rather than later.  




 Eh, even then, I was more enraptured by Halo, in both story and gameplay, and that was a long time ago. Even Defiance had a better story and comparable yet more original mehanics, and that was years ago too. Destiny is the epitome of "meh."  One big over-hyped, well-polished turd :/ 




 Depends.  If you are going to mostly solo on your toon (as i do on my main), you can do whatever you like, but if you wanted to keep it more co-op viable, for ease and quick matches, I'd stick to somewhere around 100-120, and just make different toons for more focused arcane or BT builds. 




 What level are you?  If you wanted to stay within majority pvp/co-op range, you're looking at pumping your two weakest stats (BT and arcane), and that could likely put you over range depending on what you wanted to do with this character.  I'd say this toon is already geared towards STR and dex, and stick to those weapon types with the quality build, and just make an alt character if you wanted to focus dex and arcane or BT. 




 For most grab attacks, you can mash your L+R buttons (supposedly any buttons) to get out of the attacks quicker, take less damage, and in the case of the brain suckers, only lose 1 or 2 insight.  Knowledge is power! 




 Wow. That's pretty good. My girlfriend would totally fap to this :) 




 Yeah, I'm in the same boat as you.  I bought a new PS4 for this game, and as great as it is, the frame rates and stutters are particularly obnoxious, and quite frankly, dissapointing.


The caves, old yharnam, chalice dungeons (or anywhere the witches summon the dreadlocked slender women) and quite a lot of places in general experience frame loss, and originally when I went into Old Yharnam, I was getting some terrible frame stutters where the sound track/game would make machine gun noises and almost seem like it was gonna crash or crap out.  Woohoo next gen?  As for solutions, well, I'm not sure.  I'd suggest installing some new RAM and maybe getting another video card or two to put in there, but, ahem, it's a console :D 




 Dude...you're totally right! 




 Nice write up, but one thing:  do you really think Destiny was even "mildly amusing?"  I never understood how people could play that game for more than, maybe an hour?  Between the lack of remotely interesting story and characters, the uninspired gameplay and unoriginal mechanics, and the fact they were already recycling levels/maps by mission number 3 or 4, I just don't understand how anyone could stomach that game for more than a few days at most.  Seriously.  How did more people not take a shit on that game and mail it back to the devs and demand their money back?  No offence to the people who liked it, but that was the most hyped turd to ever turd on a turd and then ask for even more turds!  Sure, I get game-play compulsion, but even then, that game was terrible!
 




 Yeah.  Now I'm one-shotting ebriatises and hot dogs and amygdalas and undead giants and ghermans in NG++ and in chalice dungeons level 5... makes me kind of sad actually :( 




 
Shut up and take my money! 




 But who was the mummified hot-dog you got the gesture from in the first place?  In keeping with the lore and the story, I think it was Elvis Presley or Michael Jackson.  Vaati is confirming this right now. 




 All for the PC if you can (with a controller), as there are solid mods to increase the frame rates and graphics, which are pretty mediocre on a console. BB had some terrible frame rate issues too unfortunately. 


That being said, yes, you got better (as from games demand), and you learned from your mistakes. Just be warned that the pace of DaS is quite different from BB. Don't expect to use the same methodology and style as you did in BB. Just be patient, and apply the same ability to learn or try new angles to fight and exploration, and you'll no doubt enjoy the experience.  




 Well - I like how beasthood and insight are inverse to each other, as it fits the story and lore so perfectly, but I wish it had been used more, or if it was relevant or useful at all. That being said, people got way too hyped and spread too many rumors about theoretical besst-mode before the game was ever released, so the fail of that hype is on them :D 




 All the other hunters and humanoids (logarius, gherman, and shadows included) are a joke compared to Eileen's hunter.  He just heals so much :D 




 Yep.  So far, the Cathedral Hunter was the only (non) boss I truly cheesed after dying to him repeatedly for an hour, and I've been in the habit of one-shotting undead giants and Ebriatises and hotdogs and amygdalas in depth 5 Chalice dungeons.  Killed Father G on NG++ in 1 minute, killed Gherman in NG+ in like, 30 seconds (3 or 4 parries), one-shotted The One Reborn in NG and NG+, and still, I have nightmares of the Cathedral Hunter on NG... 




 Play blind your first go through:  no spoilers, hints, help, or anything your first run through, as you only get that experience once, because once you're well-practiced and learn the maps and methods well enough, the game becomes super easy and is actually quite linear, though the great level design helps hide how straight-forward the game truly is.


Edit:  But it is definitely a great game, and the main game is challenging at first, as the way you fight in the previous Souls series just can't and won't translate to success in Bloodborne.  Relearning to fight in BB is fantastic.  Also worth noting, the higher depth chalice dungeons can definitely be challenging, and they keep the game challenging, but I don't know how it will translate for longevity. Also, the multiplayer system kinda sucks, and PvP connectivity sucks as well - can take a long time to find a match.  Hopefully they fix it soon. Have fun! 




 Haha.  My favorite so far was two bell maidens on a higher tier right next to the lamp where you entered the later at, so as soon as I spawned, red spiders were landing on me, then I ran into the room next door with the spiders still and continually following me, and the room was filled with undead tomb prospectors and dogs and the cannon-armed undead giant making a cameo as a regular enemy... yeah, lots of lube indeed! 




 Hotdog Asshole in cursed Lorain dungeon, Chester the Mollester and his Bag of Dead Hookers, Crows that Think They Are Dogs, and That One Fucking Asshole Hunter in the Grand Cathedral. 




 Eh. I felt the same way as I chored my way through the easier dungeons, but I enjoyed the... Challenge of some of the lower ones, and by the time I could make a lot of the community posted chalices by collecting all the chalices, I had an excess of all the highest tier crafting mats (except sage's hair).  And the coolest thing is, once you make a root dungeon of any type, you can create any of the community dungeons that were made with the exact same materials (ie, cursed or defiled) for free.  Worth noting, some of the dungeons are ridiculous with enemy placement and difficulty. Nothing like fighting a cannon-armed undead boss giant in a room fille with dogs and undead tomb prospectors :D


Edit:  it's worth it. And if you do them in progression order, you should wind up with more than enough crafting materials so there should be no extra grind at all. So far I have collected 3 blood rocks from different dungeons of different types, and I b-lined it for all the runes I use the most (like tier 3 claw mark).   




 Yeah. Some bosses you have to work out their timing and you can actually use the jump to your advantage, but most of the time it's a liability. To work around it, I just walk instead of run, and depending on how bad the camera angles are, I lock on and strafe, or just walk and roll to a favorable position, like being at the bosses side or back.  




 Don't worry, the deeper chalices are often harder than the main game :P 




 Even though it took forever, FROM (well, B team) eventually implemented what started as a player idea of having a ring (or item or w/e) to absorb souls to keep soul memory locked and not increase.


Hopefully that lesson remained with them (or was absorbed by A team), and they are implementing some arenas or summon signs and other technical improvements to fix these issues.  I don't understand why they used the wonky-ass bell system.  They could have just had your messengers hold up a bell for you that could have thematically and aesthetically matched the game, yet function in the exact same way that the summon signs did in previous games.  And also, that shit shouldn't use up your insight unless you actually connect.  Here's hoping they fix it :( 




 Don't we all miss soul memory now :/


Sure, it was an annoying system at first, but at least you could find quick matches  




 Not to mention, they are often PvP built and equipped, and often are experienced trollers, er, invaders when it comes to the souls series :P 




 I wanted to like the wheel for some smashie smashie, but honestly, the range sucks ass and it's just way too slow and uses a lot of STA.  I like Kirkhammer, because again smashie smashie, but the moveset on hunter's axe for both untransformed and transformed is just too fun, too universal, and too badass to pass up.  Between the 1h and 2h moveset, I have found a solid compromise between slash and smash. 




 I remember a few people posting about how it bugged out their game - and I can't remember if it was progression, or optional areas, but in all cases, to do what they wanted, they had to restore their saved files.


EDIT:  It might have been some of the other skips/bugs in game, but either way, players should know the risks of possibly bugging out their games. 




 In all seriousness though, don't let other people and reviews and all the hype of the 'hardness' fool you.  The one deciding factor worth considering is you:  will you learn how to play the game, learn from your mistakes, and in general become a better player in the way that FROM demands that you become a better player?  If so, yes, go for it.  If not, then don't purchase it.


While other games play more like movies (quick time events, and simple, easy narratives) that are almost impossible to lose even if you try, Bloodborne (and FROM in general) utilizes the gaming experience in a way that seldom developers do, not just in their mysterious narratives, but they force you to learn from your mistakes, as when the rubber hits the road in these games, there really is no just derping and dragging your way through these game.

Again, the game is hard but fair, and if you can learn from your mistakes, learn the mechanics, learn the attacks and methods of the enemies you are fighting, and in general, become better (as the game will demand that you become a better player) than yes, I would advise you to get it.  If you're not looking something to really challenge you in the video game medium, than no, don't get it.  Good hunting to you o/ 




 Whoa.  Thank you.  I have no idea how gold works or what I can do with it, but I assure you I will put it to good use.... does it by chance un-ban me from the subreddits that have given me the boot?  :P 




 Yeah.  I've seen a bunch of posts from people who messed up their games using jump skips and things like that, asking about the problems it has caused for the games, which seem to be irriversable.  It's still a short run, even without the skip.  Good luck to you! 




 But they clearly bark in both the 'waking world' and the nightmare. 




 Be warned - FROM will ruin gaming for you, and other games will feel like Hello Kitty's Island Adventure, where you run around slapping little girls with wet noodles that have no impact, and there is no risk and little reward. 




 Careful though, and be sure to back up your save files.  These skips aren't intentional, and they have been known to bug out the game or make you miss out on certain opportunities due to the nature of the bug. 




 This game follows same format as Dark Souls.  Dark Souls 2 was B-Team's ideas and methods.  That being said, the game is actually super linear and you can get back to the end game content within an hour or two if you memorized the game fairly well, as so many areas are either optional, or easy to run past.


To get to the first part of the nightmare, you only need to kill Cleric Beast, Papa G, and then Vicar.   Then just head to forbidden woods (or the other houses with lanterns) and get the tonsil stone.  To get to the second half of the nightmare (game progression, not the first optional part of the nightmare), Just add Shadows, Rom, and The One Reborn to the list, and boom, you're there. 




 Yeah. It's fun when they show up as normal enemies in the chalice dungeons... Surrounded by dogs and those weird undead fuckers... 




 No. It's a short cut to midway point in that elevator. If I remember correctly, you walk across a tile type roof top, and if you look at the elevator shaft, there are tiers like steps and you can hop back down to the bottom. Sorry to spoil it for you, but it's nothing too exciting :) 




 PSA - depending on your play style, The -HP ones aren't worth it. They cancel out your rally potential every time you take a tick of damage. 


Also, i feel like cursed gems are kind of unnecessary, because there are plenty of solid non-cursed ones. I use a regular hunters axe at around 490 on the stat screen, and the only downside is one of the gems has +2.9% Stamina usage on its +22% physical damage. No other curses on that thing though.  




 Yeah. Levels don't make that much of a difference once you have a specialized build at around 100-120. That being said, I wish there were more things to spend blood echoes on :/ 




 Ha.  We have the exact same build - except I rounded up to a nice even level 175 with 28 arcane instead of 25.  Now I'm running around in NG++ with a million+ echoes at most times, so I'm debating on raising up to level 198 to 50 arcane...   




 LOL casuls 




 Title says it all.  But yes, I have googled it, yes, I have read multiple posts that say the same thing, but it doesn't seem clear, since I get nothing but error messages from dungeons I try here on the reddit list and elsewhere.  Also, yes, I read the chalice dungeon reddit wiki, and it said something like, "you must have created the exact same chalice," but I tried that, and even then when I try to use a glyph, I still receive the message "you do not meet the requirements" or whatever it is.  And if that is true, that you must have already made one of the same exact dungeons to use a glyph, isn't that a bit obtuse and redundant?  Does that mean you need double the crafting materials for every glyph you want to use?  And does that mean you must leave both tombstones occupied with those chalices if you want to create similar glyphs?


For example, I mainly wanted to create this dungeon:  http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/805577-bloodborne/71574146

It is a Lower Loran with fetid + rotting offerings


Yet, if I try to even make a lower loran chalice dungeon, I don't even have the options to use the offerings of fetid and rotting - so how can I even create a chalice to use that glyph in the first place?  Point is, I am thoroughly confused and frustrated.  Thanks in advance for your replies -_- 




 I sort of agree with him on a lot of it.  Insight isn't relevant enough, the game needs more invasions, it would have been cool if the game wasn't so linear, and I am mixed on the blood vial thing.  On one hand, some boss battles are challenging, and can be drawn out if you play carefully and patiently, so less blood vials would suck there.  Also, enemies can still kill you super quickly in some combos and fast or hard hitting attacks, so the numbers aren't so much of a problem there, but on the other hand, 20 is a lot of vials to carry, and yes, sometimes it makes the game way too easy.... 




 Is this the memory leak type deal everyone talks about? 




 If you stick a bit to his right, not too far from his foot, he will mostly just stomp at you, leaving one of his left hands hanging in the air that you can whack on (don't lock on at all for the whole fight).  You gotta be ready to dodge though, because he will flail and go crazy and slam his fists around here and there.  Anyway, you can totally take him down quickly using this strategy, and once he gets to his final phase, just cheese him by chasing his tail, because he will only jump forward, not backwards.  Just stay behind him, and mind his foot stomps, chase him when he jumps, and whack his tail again.  Rinse and repeat till dead.


Edit:  no memory leak or anything like that.  It just baits him into certain attacks and moves and turns this fight into cheese mode. 




 And to think, I fought Amagdala for the first time in NG+ the good old-fashioned suck-ass way - got my ass handed to me and took a lot of patience 


That being said, it's kinda lame that if you barely stick to his right, you can just whack at his hand and he mostly just stomps his feet :/ 




 Ha.  Just beat him.  This did the trick:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dsd9S_Crp0

No memory leak or anything.  It was hard to get past the first phase or 2 for me, as I got hit a lot, though I dodged even more, as I couldn't bait as expertly as this dude did, but cheesing him in the last was easy. 




 Yup.  Just got to this asshole, and after a quick test go to see what it's like, I've decided that the "defiled dungeon" is the stupidest shit mechanic ever 


Edit:  I don't know if I'm gonna have the patience for this fight. Gimmie a challenging, punishing boss fight, sure, but don't inflate the difficulty by giving me half HP for a boss that would likely 1hKO me anyhow. 




 That might help.  I'm too high level to help you though, not that the levels make much of a difference in this game, but i wind up rolling in 1 million echoes at a time in NG+, so what else am I gonna do with em other than level up? 




 What level?  I'm close to this boss in my game. Just soloed the hot dog last night. 


Edit: but honestly, these bosses take patience, an more people seems like more of a liability than not.  




 There is no proof that Rom is human.  That, and every other human in game gets a lot of screen time in item descriptions, dialogue, or interaction, yet there is none of that in regards to Rom, which would seem like a huge oversight.  What we do get are several references to the Bygenwyrth spider (Rom), who keeps the master (the great ones) away from it's seekers/pupils (the cultists).  A lot of people interpret that note to mean Rom keeps wilhem from his peeps, but I don't think that is the case.  Rom somehow cock-blocks or mutes the rituals the cultists are trying to create, hence, once you kill Rom, the blood moon or paleblood moon or whatever lights up the sky and the crazy people in Yahr Guhl finish their ritual to bring forth the one reborn and turn people to stone and other crazy shit.  This is further supported by the notes that say, "the spider keeps rituals from us," and other crazy shit like that.


The point is, people keep interpreting Micolash's vague madman speech to mean that Rom was granted a gift of many eyes by the great ones, but that is just one interpretation, never-mind the contradiction of, 'why would the great-ones help Rom in any way? specifically since he is obviously somehow blocking their rituals and blocking the cultists from contacting or bringing forth the other great ones?'  It's just as likely that Micolash just means, "make me as you made rom," like someone might say, "I wish I could fly, like the birds in the sky."  Worth noting, Micolash says the lake has turned to mud or whatever, which again, is reference to Rom somehow interfering with the other great ones and the cultists' rituals.  I've posted about Rom and Micolash and other relations in many related posts - might be worth looking at the other lore theories people have posted for sure. Either way, we still don't know the how's or the where's or the why's of Rom....and it all only brings up more questions. 




 I LOL'd way harder than I should have.  Also,I like it how you have zero bloodtinge :D 




 Yep.  I only fought the dude in NG+, so I can't speak of the NG cycle, but even in NG+, I could kill the sword in the ground with either one hit from my weapon, or even 1 shot from my +9 hunter's pistol (I only have like, 6 bloodtinge), so you don't even need a strong shot on it. 




 Well, it's not like rocks are all that common either, but there is a lot less gear to upgrade :D 




 I can confirm similar results.  With 250+ (slightly higher) discovery (2 eye runes+25 arcane stat) I found about 8-9 chunks in using exactly 15 BHM's (started with 45, but ended with 30), HOWEVER, I only killed the first 4 easy and quick to get to werewolves.  I never bothered with the 5th since he was up the stairs, down the hall, and out of the way :D 




 Haha.  I like how you over-simplified everything.  Shit gets crazy in-depth complex.  Just look up "lore" in this subreddit, or go youtube "davecontrollive" or "vaatividya" bloodborne youtube videos (they are some of the go to's when it comes to making money off youtube souls content, I mean, lore)  :) 




 Dead hookers.  First time I saw that fucker, I said to myself, *"I know the type."*  Those are with out a doubt, sacks of dead hookers.  Vaati already confirmed it bro. 




 Question is in the title. Thanks on advance for your replies.  




 By life-swallowing, I just mean those organizations that heavily indoctrinate you from an early age, from all angles, and that essentially try to run your life and be the central, most important facet of your existence.   And a follow up:  How did you come to find that it wasn't for you?  And how did you come to find your own identity in the world? 




 As the non-spoiler title doesn't say, What's through the locked door at the bottom (or middle) of the pit trough the door/lift in chapel ward that unlocks after you kill BSB?


I'm not talking about the door to the abandoned workshop. But IIRC there is a locked golden-ornate looking door (guarded by a werewolf iirc) either at the bottom of that pit, or maybe the middle section. Can anyone please tell me where that leads to? I accidentally beat the game and never got around to opening it up. Thanks. 

 




 Hey all.  I already accidentally beat the game in a no-spoiler/help run, so I am going through NG+ trying out all the optional stuff I missed or was barred from completing upon being booted to NG+, and with the tonsil stone/Amygdala, are there any immediate consequences for defeating that boss?  Will it change the progression in anyway, or bar me from completing other quest lines or cut off any other optional areas?  Also, since getting to the Amygdala puts you in Nightmare Frontier early, can you progress through that at all?  Or is it just a portion of it, and you have to follow the normal progression? Thanks in advance for your replies. 




 The chest right after father G in the study on the way to the Oedon Chapel had a kin cold blood in it. I swear it had a regular cold blood in it the first time round, because I think I would remember an item that gave me 20k souls at level 15, and the first time i saw a kin coldblood in my first play-trough was when i killed Ron the Grumpy Caterpillar. Can anyone else confirm or deny?  Or did you find anything to make you think otherwise?  Thanks in advance for your response.  




 U r all HIV bluud fagetz cuz u killt ravid siff!  wreckt 




 Mainly, what the fuck?  I somewhat fancy myself a pro when it comes to piecing together FROM lore, but even with playing part-time detective through Bloodborne, what the fuck just happened?


Also, super annoyed that it automatically kicked me to NG+. I didn't even get a chance to +10 a weapon  




 Loving how the game keeps getting weirder and weirder!  As odd as the fight seemed at first, I really loved the Ron the Angry Caterpillar encounter!  I kinda felt bad killing it though, since it started off just sitting there, minding it's own business like some kinda funky, own-business-minding, giant outer-space slug :/


And then the stuff that's coming after that... whoa!  I am thoroughly confused and confounded, though I have my conspiracy theories as to what species had sex with which to make all these vicious magic monsters!  All critiques aside, this is a fantastic game! 




 Be honest please.  I don't want to hear disclaimers, fluffy plattitudes, PC nonsense, or rationalizations and justification.  Just be honest, and feel free to be extra mean about it :)

edit:  derp ta terp 









 You know, that one guy, who is in the tower with the gatling gun who mows you down if you stop to lace up your corset?  Does he drop anything of consequence?  I ask, because, after dying to him stupidly a bunch, I accidentally killed him by kicking him out of the tower, and he fell to and died on the walkway below, but the item(s) he dropped were just floating in mid-air above the ground, impossible to pick up.  I tried reloading and dying, but the items just dissapeared.


Loving the game so far, but some of the little bugs like this, among the stuttering and frame loss has been a bummer.  Anyway, thanks in advance for your replies. 




 LOL Fagz amirite?  My beby alreadyy staurved to deth cuz I to buzy playin Bleedbourne Soulz to feed teh littul faget.  Stupid casul babee faget got WRECKT!1  I tuld it to git guud an now I use it as a doorsttop!

 









 This subreddit is awesome, I can't wait to participate, and I have a serious question here:  To go more in-depth than just the title, what if easy going, non-greedy Joe-Bloe has one reddit account, and posts once to get in on the drawing, and donates his part, while Joe-Bitch and Joe-Biznitch are friends, and together have 100 different reddit accounts each, and they can and will join the same drawing with 200 entries.  Is there anyway to weed this out?  I mean, never mind one person with multiple accounts, there could be multiple people pooling in, or any number of Joe-Biznitches out there.  


While I understand the necessity of paying as a donation rather than buying in, it's sort of a bummer to know that it can be so easily abused.  Never mind the possibility of someone using a bunch of accounts to enter the drawing, but there is a chance that they wouldn't even be donating their part to the actual winner anyway.  Not trying to be a bummer or anything, and I still plan on participating, but I was curious as to what everyone thought about it, or if there are any security measures in place to try to help weed out things like this?  Is it just one of those things that 'goes with the territory' of this premise and subreddit?  Thanks in advance for your replies.

 Hi all.  As the title said, I haven't really played much since the month of the last DLC (Ivory King), and I was wondering with all the news of the Sin of The First Flame and patches, if anything has really changed in game?  I don't mean the basics, like, katanas were buffed and lightning spears were nerfed again, but I'm just curious if they added any new areas or NPC's or more experience-changing elements like that.  Thanks in advance for your replies :) 




 And found it near completely lackluster, flat, and...boring?

 nbsp;

I mean, once upon a time it was great fun to me (haven't played it seriously/competitively since wrath) - and I was dissapointed to find it as seemingly dull as I have as of late.  I suppose my expectations and I have changed a bit over the years, but the fundamentals of WoW haven't.  That being said,  I remember it once seemed like a high point in PvP play for MMO's, but I'm thinking that I might be comparing it too much to all the games I've played since then.  


I mean, GW2 does large scale/siege combat much better, and is a little bit more action oriented, Rift did class trees/systems and basic combat better, Tera has more interactive and fun comat, EvE carries actual risks and rewards that will get your heart pumping, but WoW combat just feels so flat and dated.  I'm sure a lot of people still enjoy it, but I was just wondering what other's thought of it nowadays?  I was hoping to pick up WoW PvP like I used to in between hardcore raiding (now I play casuls lulz), but I jut couldn't do it, though I did appreciate the quick que times.   


At heart I still love WoW, and it will stay where it is for me: my de facto PvE game, as I still think WoW is the most consistent and best general PvE experience for MMO's.  At the least, it's the most polished and well-funded experience :)  Would love to hear other's thoughts.

Thanks in advance for your responses.  




 Hi all - as the title says, I just bought Witcher 2, and I have very little familiary with the plot and characters, and I was wondering if there are any must knows when it comes to the story or lore so that I won't miss too much of the 2nd game's plot?  Any recomended reading or videos before I start playing the second game?  Normally I'd be quick to play the first title in a series like this, but when the reviews say the combat/mechanics/etc are so much better and smoother in the second, it makes me want to skip the first, especially since the third is coming out right around the corner, and my gaming time is limited.  Furthermore, I ask because I don't want to risk stumbling across too many spoilers by accident, so I appreciate any directions you wticher fans may give.


Without reading too much on plot and setting, so far, the games and ideas in it sound awesome, and I was especially craving low-fantasy, dark-souls esque game play, and other than a few odd or similar titles, this seemed to fit the bill close enough.  The rest of the factions, political intrigue and backstabbery spookiness is just icing on the cake :)  Thanks in advance for your replies. 




 Hi all,


As the title says, is this game still live?  While I've never played DAOC, I've heard mostly good things over the years, and I ask because I was interested on joining to scratch my PvP itch.


That being said, how are the populations on live?  Does it require a sub?  I mean, I have no problems with a sub, but I was wondering what the differences were between live, and the emu servers?  How are the population on the emu servers?  Also, how are the populations on the emu servers?


A few more questions:  what are the different types of realms/shards on live?  Ie, PvP?  PvE?  Free for all?  That sort of thing?  How are they organized?  I've read that DAOC was 3 v 3 realm factions, but I was wondering how they further organized it.  Lastly, how does this game hold up compared to more modern games?  Is the UI/organization/etc. fairly smooth and intuitive?  I have no problem with old or aging graphics, but a clunky UI and lack of features will always be a big draw back.  Thanks in advance for your replies :) 




 Hi all.  I was watching game-play footage and reading up on Albion Online, and seeing the game made me crave some similar sort of play - that is, some sort of pvp/crafting focused exploration open world fun.  The closest game recommendation I could find in searches for similar, yet already released titles was UO.  I've known about UO a long time, I've just never played it, as back in the day I wound up on EQ, and never tried UO.


That being said, for all you UO fans out there, care to give me a brief run-down of the game?  Some must-know tips for newbs maybe?  Any in-game recommendations or hints?  In the mean-time I've been reading up on wikis and websites, but I always enjoy talking to established fans and players.


Thanks in advance for your replies :)

 




 For those of you who have been following the game and/or playing in the alpha, can anyone deny or confirm if this statement is accurate or not?  Of course I don't mean that I expect it to be exactly the same as EVE, but what about a fairly close approximation?

I mean - from equipment slots being filled with abilities just like mod slots give you abilities in Eve, to the devs trying to control RMT, to the 'you are your equipment' (in eve, your ship=you), to the security statuses of green, yellow, and red, to controlling territory, to losing your gear on death, it all seems pretty similar.

So far from what I've read and looked up, it seems like an awesome idea, and I'm sort of excited, but at the same time, it is also sort of horrifying.  If let's say, resource collecting is as boring as it is in EVE with mining (target rocks, turn on lasers, move, ship, store, compress, bring haulers, etc) or needing to multi/cheat box 16 accounts to truly get anywhere, then it loses a lot of its appeal.  Or let's say with grouping and fleets, if combat is as simple as being an F1 monkey like it is in EVE medium to large fleets (ie, you target who you're supposed to, turn on damage, and that's the fight), or any other number of quirks like that, it just seems like it would be boring, redundant, and, uh... not fun?


I mean, I've been playing EVE for a long time, but I mostly play to spend time with my brothers.  We only do PVP in a large null-sec alliance.  But even with the focus being combat, honestly, I don't feel like I'm playing a game with EVE - I feel like I'm tooling around and manipulating old, simple mechanics that resemble a game.  Ie, I feel like I'm just playing with the bones of a game, not the actual flesh and blood of it.  I enjoy it, to a point, but also, even with blowing up big spaceships and ruining many people's days, it's still kinda boring.


Anyway, those are my ruminations.  Just wondering what people think so far.  Thanks in advance for your time and responses. 




 Hi all - As the title says says, do you get the resources you used building buildings back in any way shape or form when you remove or replace them in your garrison?  I googled it in various ways but never found a straight answer.  Thanks in advance for your response. 




 Hi all.

As the title of the post says, I have questions on armor. Specifically, I know equipping an armor set is based on secondary stats, but is there a quick way to tell how much of your stats an armor piece uses?


I was taking armor pieces on and off while looking at the stat sheet and I noticed the stats going up and down, but is there an easier way to keep track of it?  Or a way to hell how many stats total a piece of armor or full set uses?


Also, aside doctor buffs, are there other ways to increase those secondary stats?  What about the reallocation (or whatever its called) option?  How does that work?


As far as HAM goes, I noticed things die when one of the 3 bars runs out, so does that essentially mean you're only as good as your weakest ham bar?  And with the different consumption levels of HAM from abilities, and enemies doing damage to different bars, is there an easy way to track this?  I noticed my abilities seem to drain different HAM numbers on enemie - does that occur based on the weapon I use or from the abilities themselves?  (Ie., basic attack or overshot with a rifle, or regular attack and 2h lunge attack with a heavy axe)


right now a lot of this stuff seems pretty arbitrary and nonsensical to me, so any clarity would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for your replies :) 




 Hi all.

Whether or not you played the original Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning (which closed down in 2013), I'm curious if anyone here has played or plays on the private server?


http://www.returnofreckoning.com/about.php

I never had a chance to play the original game, but I plan on registering/setting it up the emu soon, and I was just wondering if anyone had some opinions or tips or ideas to offer up on the private server.  Specifically, how is balance between the two factions?  How is the game play in general?  That sort of thing.  As it stands, I know they are still ironing it out quite a bit and working on bugs and stuff, but so it goes for private servers.  Thanks in advance for your replies 




 Hello all,

I've just reinstalled MW4 Mercs on my newer Win 8.1 machine, and just like my old machine on windows 7, it's been working great.  

The only problem is in the title of this post - any changes I make in the MW4 config ap don't seem to save.  Does anyone have any suggestions or know a fix for this?  Thanks in advance for your replies. 




 Seriously.  I don't know what it is about this game that sees that a good portion of the time your retarded pickup group loses terribly back to back, but I can't take much more of this (some things have not changed since beta).  In short I'm looking for people who are at least as competent as a pickle or a jar of mayonnaise, who are looking for other players to group with.  I'm on Pacific Standard time (CA, USA). 

Drop me a line here on Reddit or in game.  My IGN is Balcombe. 




 Ok - not to repeat what anyone else has said because I've searched it many times over, but is this UI really what were left with?  I mean, it seems so piss-poor that it's hard to believe, so please understand tht I make this thread just to make sure I'm not missing anything:

So I log in last night for the first time in a year, and I didn't even get a chance to play because I spent about 2-3 stupid OCD hours after a years worth of patching sorting trough mechs, trying to find parts, figuring the terrible UI out until I stripped all my mechs, called it a night, and went to bed. 


Now. I've tried a buncha searches to see if there was a fix or if I broke something, but it seems this new UI was put out nearly a year ago, and almost immediately the MWO forum blew up with players talking about how terrible it was to use and how it made te gaming experience a shit-show. Anyway. That was a lot of complaints from a lot of people almost a year ago, and it's still there?  So that means some dip-shit at PGI saw all that, experienced what a piece of crap the UI was, and somehow said, "it's acceptable. Working as intended."


I mean, I ask because, WTF?  I checked the patch notes today, stupidly thinking it would say the UI is fixed, but I guess to them there is nothing to fix?  Thanks in advance for your replies.  




 Anyone know of good current or in-development games that are what MWO should have been?  I play Hawken here and there as a sort of filler for FPS meeting mech action, but that is more FPS/twitch based, and it lacks the ideal of a mech game:  
the mechlab/strategybrawling and twitch combat (though the brawling should fill its niche in there somewhere).  I looked into perpetum, both good and bad reviews, and it is too reminiscent of Eve, which I already play, and I refuse to try to get into another game like that.  Eve can be brutal and time consuming enough.  Essentially, I want to play MWO, just not the MWO that has been derped and rederped.  Anyone have any suggestions?  Anything with a solid mech/lab, decent options for builds and chassis, etc, that doesn't gate so much of the piddly amount of new content for absurd real money prices?  I mean, cash-shops are fine, but not how MWO has done it:  how many hundreds of dollars do they want to keep asking for a sub-par game before the diehard battletech fans kick in their monitors and quit the game?


I don't say these things to continue what I see as a fairly justified bitch-fest about the state of MWO, but from the bigger picture, that MWO is that crack-baby that was dropped on its head too many times and wound up in foster care and the only people willing to adopt it also abuse it.  Us long-time fans want to love it, but it's lacking in so many ways, and in the mean time PGI is golding the IP hostage, never mind the fact that us founders got screwed, the dev process has been clunky and slow, and PGI has more than bled the community dry in constant, shameless, bull-shit cash-grabs, and continues to do so.


Anyway - I say all this to give you an idea of the game I'm looking to play.  I don't mind in game cash-shops, so long as it doesn't gate content, specifically when that content is minimal.  A little bit of pay to sparkle or even p2w is fine.  I'd prefer a nice mix of strategy and twitch, and I'd prefer there be giant, powerful, robots smashing each other into oblivion.  Bonus points if the robots actually take skill, patience, and attention to drive.

Cheers, and thanks in advance for your responses. 




 As the title says, for crystal use purposes, what are BAMs considered?  Boss monsters or regular monsters?


That being said, does anyone have a good, up-to-date guide for leveling up via mob grinding?  I google searched it, but a lot of the information I'm finding seems out of date or changed.  If anyone could provide a link or put up a quick list of optimum mobs/locations to grind, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks in advance for your replies. 




 Hi all.  I just started playing the game and I am thoroughly enjoying my first few hours.

I'm writing this post to see if there is anyone available to join me.  I started a warrior (named Heavy.Meddles) and a sorcerer (Balcombe), and I'm having a hell of a time trying to decide which one to main because they are both fun to play so far.

Drop me a line here or in game if you'd like to level/group with me.

Thanks. 




 Hi Everybody,

As the title says, I haven't played since 2011 or so, and I was just wondering what some of the major changes were, as I have been looking at playing the game some more.  When I left the game, my main was a level 50ish (I don't remember exactly) magician (or whatever they are called), as well as a mid level assassin and warrior (or whatever they were called).

And yes, while I have been looking/googling this stuff a little bit at a time, I also figured why not ask the friendly reddit people for a more concise answer, especially to a few specific questions:

1.  I left a little while after they released the kromede/judge and lower level solo missions.  What are the major game/class/etc changes since then?

2.  PvP was fun - the abyss being one of the primary hunting grounds - are the PvP battles still hearty and large scale and super laggy?  Also, being that it is a korean MMO - while the PvP gear was good, it was also an insane grind (just like the PvE gear) to get any of it.  Is this still the case?  I mean, I don't need or want gear to be handed to me, but korean farm-style playing is madness!  Has this changed for the better?

3.  Is the game still PvP centric in general?  What are the primary servers, and how is the balance on them?

4.  Offhand, I can't remember if you paid straight kinah to reskin items, or if you just bought a consumable.  How is reskinning/wardrobe handled nowadays?

5.  How about the Classes/Professions or whatever they are called?  Any one care to give me a quick run down?  Ie, "PvP is dominated by so-and-so, so-and-so massive DPS OP, so-and-so massive under powered, so-and-so is a joke, etc"

6.  How is the economy?  As usual, I remember this MMO being dominated by gold-sellers and bots, everything was super pricey, and kinah was slow to grind, making everything a PITA.  Has this changed for the better?  Is it more stable?  Still bot dominated?  Etc?

Thanks in advance for your replies.

 Hi.  As the title says, PC, top tier SM bracket in NG+ looking to trade my rampart golem armor/helm for a pair of rampart golem gloves.  Will be around for a few hours tonight, and maybe tomorrow night.  Drop me a line if you're interested.  Thank you.

P.S. - I tired posting this in r/wheelanddeal but I kept getting error messages 




 This conversation came up within a post of this subreddit, so I wanted to ask the DS community at large what their suggestions are when it comes to finding other games that are challenging and intriguing enough to play through, ie., games that raise the bar like the Souls series, or at least, games that don't feel too easy or stale, especially when compared to the Souls franchise.  While I know this isn't directly DaS2 per se, I feel it is in good taste, and could help other people find new and fun games to play as well.  I'm a PC gamer, but I do plan on getting a PS4 in the months to come for Bloodborne, but any system suggestions are welcome, as other people can benefit.


Point is, while there are many fun games out there, few have the risk and reward factors, immersion, compelling and mysterious stories, lore, and fun gameplay wrapped together as well as the Souls series does.  I'm not necessarily looking for Souls clones, or games that are even in the same fantasy genre or share similar combat systems, but just other well balanced, challenging games.  Worth noting, other than saying DaS2 is a better RPG game, but DaS is a better Souls game, I'm leaving out critique on DaS and DaS2 for this post, mainly focusing on what makes them fun and challenging games.


While I'm open to any game, regardless of reviews and opinions, to help narrow it down, I can add a few critiques or reviews of other noteworthy games and series:


Morrowwind, Oblivion, Skyrim, that series:  Fun, to a point, often redundant, repetitive, weaker combat/magic systems, worth their dollar value in entertainment, but the stories and characters were never compelling enough that I ever finished a single game, even after logging 60-100+ hours on some.


MMO's:  Honestly, most of them have terrible writing, bad stories, stale gameplay, and very few innovations.  They often lack any weight, and feel like button mashing with little to no immersion.  Thus they wind up repetitive grinds, even if some of the character, boss, and level design is well rendered.  The treadmill just gets old, and this comes from an old Ultima/EQ/WoW (played WC since WC1, had to know what happened in the story, etc.


Legend of Grimrock:  Right up my alley.  I love old-school dungeon crawlers - for the challenges in puzzles and combat, the change of pace, as well as nostalgia.  Graphics aint everything.  I have been members of Dungeon Master/Chaos Strikes Back/related games and clones communities, and have many user-made dungeons and other emulators and remakes for these types of games.


Dead Space:  Overall, this is my favorite shooter/survivor horror game in recent years.  Great story, great characters, lots of twists and turns, well-written, scary and immersive, and somewhat innovative, or at least, had some noteworthy differences.  Loved that your character was a crafty engineer rather than a soldier.  You used mining tools for weapons!  Was great!


Dragon Age Origins:  Was a great game at the time.  Was definitely immersive, as the characters were cheeky and well-written, the voice acting was good, and the world had some great lore, even if the tropes are old as writing itself.  Looking back, the combat was kinda meh, if somewhat strategic at times, and the levels seem pretty small and thus the game limited, but still a memorable game.  I never bothered with the second, as I was bored within a minute of the demo.


Mass Effect:  While I enjoyed the first and second, by the time I got to the third just this last month or two (yeah, I was late to the party), I dunno, the game just felt stale and limited and so easy, even on the highest difficulties.  The levels and areas to explore just seemed so simple and rehearsed, and at times it just feels like the AI/system is playing the game for me.  While the series was intriguing enough for the first two games, after being ruined by the souls series, now it just seems boring and redundant.



Anyway, all that being said, I'm up for all and any suggestions, preferably with the elements of good writing, fun/challenging gameplay, immersion, and better risk/reward systems.  Saving and reloading constantly definitely diminishes this, but I look forward to what you guys have to say.  Thanks in advance. 




 Hello everyone.  While I know there have already been speculative posts on this reddit about the title question, can anyone confirm or deny if any of the higher-ups at Sony/From/Miyazaki/etc. have either confirmed, denied or even given a maybe on whether or not there will be a Bloodborne bundle?  I've searched the web, but no dice so far.



I ask because, if so, I would like to wait for the bundle, rather than pre-ordering the deluxe edition Bloodborne early, as well as a PS4 separately.  Thanks in advance for your replies. 




 Well, if I had to title this story, it would be, "Guess how many times I died during the tutorial?"  Psshaw, none at all.  That would be pathetic, amirite, or amirite!?

So what started out as a perfect no death chievo run for the first three minutes ended abruptly in Things Betwixt when I derped off the edge of a cliff.  I said, "you know what death, not today."  I then died 2 minutes later when I missed a plunging attack and took an arrow in the ass.  After being defeated by the tutorial, I headed on my to Majula, to ya know, kick rocks and mope around with the rest of the bipolar twits.

After losing my left testicle to one of the piglets, I went forth to brave the forest of the fallen giants.  At this point, my girlfriend started talking at me.  I love her to death, but man she can talk.  I nodded, and I said "uh huh, uh huh, yeah" and then I died.  She kept talking.  And then I died again.  Then I realized I love her, but I don't love her to death, and I got mad at her, and I told her, "not now, you can fill my ear holes with words later!," and that's when she got mad at me, so I took a break from the game to grovel and kiss her ass and apologize.  I told her to stay away from me for the next week or two as I would be very angry.  Very, very angry.  Lots of cursing to ensue....


Ahem, so, anyway, I resume braving the forest of fallen giants with a crossbow in my left hand, a mace in my right hand, and an imported sack over my head to hide my hollowed shame.  I die a few more times  whilst slapping around various zombies and meth addicts, and finally I make it to the last giant.  Speaking of which, did you ever think what a liar he is?  There are quite a few more giants in Black Gulch, and they exist in memories at the least, so fuck you Last Giant, you lying liar.  What else are you lying about?!  Ehrm, anyway, I take him down on the first go, and he died like a punk with no integrity what so ever.  Having a surplus of souls I buy a zillion wooden bolts to slay hookers and vampires from a distance, and with my spirits renewed, I zip over to Heide's tower to go toe to toe with the dragon rider.  I run past all the enemies and bum rush the fog gate.  I was going to duke it with him like a man, cuz I'm a man like that - always working on cars and bench-pressing saber-tooth tigers like a man, but somehow, mysteriously, by no plan of my own, the dragon rider took exactly six steps forward and raised his mighty halberd at me.  I'm no fool, so I dodge right as he lunges forward, and whaddayaknow, the clumsy bastard fell off the edge of the arena and died like a derp!  I was going to raise the edges of the platform so we could spar, but I, uh, just forgot.  Anyway, that is where I paused my adventure so far.  Tonight I plan on going back for fake Ornstein, because ya know, I hate liars.  One more baddie to die in poverty and shame!  I got your number fake Ornstein!


Anyway, after working on various DaS level 1 runs, I gotta say, while easier so far in some ways than DaS 1Broing, the worst of it has been learning the sweet spot on the pitiful dodge roll.  Even at well under 50%, there are like what, negative two i-frames?  I swear, compared to the fast roll of DaS, or the ninja-WTF-flipping, I feel like an obese shut-in with no cartridge in his knees.  Learning to dodge as such has a much steeper curve - especially since my onebro seems to purposefully roll into every arrow that is shot at him.


That being said, stay tuned for more adventures of a DS2 OneBro!   




 After taking a break from Dark Souls 2 I returned to Dark Souls and created a Paladin character. 

I found myself in Anor Londo, stuck at the infamous silver knight archer gauntlet, and while I've had melee characters have little trouble with that part before, for some reason, I just couldn't get past it.  I prolly lost 50k souls total and lots of humanity at this point,  and after dying countless times (like 12 times, but I can't count that high), I die another 5 times, and finally, on like, the 20th try, I dash up that small span one final time, and there in the middle of it is a black vagabond!

I panic because I've never seen one, and I wanna know what's inside it, but I also know I'm in the worst position ever.  He shoots a homing soul mass type projectile right over me, and by the time I realize, "hey, it's the most rare enemy in the game, i wanna kill it for lootz!" and try to swing my sword, he swings his pincer and one shots me, and a second later the dragon arrows start  raining down on my body.  That was the first and only time I've seen a black vagabond to date.  I think I remember seeing a red one, but that was a year or two ago.

Anyway.  At that point, after dying 1,745 times at that spot, and finally to the black vagabond, my hatred turned to laughter, and after briefly contemplating suicide, I finally got past the silver knights.  Sadly, I have yet to see that little black bastard since then.

With that story out of the way, what is your most memorable death?  Also, has anyone killed a black vagabond?  If so, what did it drop?  With how bad-ass they are, it's gotta be the cure for cancer, or an autographed picture of Jesus!  What say you?

-One of the best Simpsons quotes ever, 




 You're welcome on the info thing.

Well, neither of those games play like bloodborne, and most games don't in either style, mechanics, or lore and story-telling, but they have their similarities and are quite different.  Dead Space 1 and 2 are solid survival horror games.  They follow mysterious plotlines that you have to fit together and are slowly revealed, yet even then mysterious, leaving you with many questions.  Also, the game-play is similar to Dark Souls in that it is a bit more slow and plodding and thoughtful, and it can be challenging, especially on higher difficulties, though it is standard load/save type method of doing things.


Darkest dungeon is a RNG party-based dungeon crawling game, where you recruit characters who die permanent deaths, focus on party comps and smart item usage and upgrades of your town hub, characters and armor, and it is pretty similar to the Cthulu mythos of crazed cults and mysterious dark portals and Eldritch truth.


A few others are Salt and Sanctuary - an upcoming 2d souls type game yet to be released, and Lords of The Fallen is a similar DaS style game (die and leavebloodstains, lose all your currency, focus on builds and weighty combat) was released last fall, and even though it isn't anywhere as good as DaS/BB, it is still one of the only directly DaS inspired games out there.  And of course, there are the Original Souls - Demon Souls, DaS and Das2, all worth playing, even though they are similar yet quite different from Bloodborne.


Edit:  Some other good 2D souls like games (death has consequences, risk vs reward, etc) are Rogue Legacy and Shovel Knight. 




 Right, but it depends on weapon scaling and stat investments as well, and the point remains, that there is only one in main game play through, and it sucks having to run hours of chalice dungeons or run to a whole new playthrough if you don't pick it up. 




 Takes a lot of patience - you can't get greedy or you will be killed in one shot.  I stayed at range, baiting out his charge attack (turns into a leap later on, so it changes the timing of when you have to dodge), which is easy to dodge once you know the tells and the timing, or his vomit (which he hardly ever did for me ). 


 If he vomits, and you can get to him quickly, whack his legs 3 times, and it will stun him for a moment, but make sure you don't get too greedy.


When he charges, dodge to the right and behind him, and either do one running or quick attack, and back away/dodge again, as he will quickly retaliate.  With the axe (what I think I was using), I could only get off one attack or risk being killed.


I've fought him in his weaker versions more head on which was easy, but that is the strategy I used to beat him, as I wasn't doing so hot facing him head on, as a lot of times he would charge at me even if I was close to him, and I hardly had the time or room to dodge, and it just complicated the fight too much for me, though in his last phase he hardly would want to charge me at all, so I did some very hesitant, scared shitless face-to-face combat, but I wasn't happy about it :D 




 Dude.  That shit totally reminds me of full-metal alechemist and the creation of a philosopher's stone.  All you need is a large number of hapless, terrifies souls to complete the ritual create it :D


Edit:  And the other ones who didn't get turned to stone were turned into giant lumpy, human flesh-ipedes! 




 Nope.  I don't like the blunderbuss or the cane, but the pistol is awesome and easy to parry with.  Maybe you should mix up your weapon useage and play style?  As much as I enjoy(ed) the plodding, strategic combat of DaS, I definitely think FROM did right with a change, and I find BB infinitely more fun, fluid, intense, and enjoyable when it comes to combat mechanics.  I love DaS, but BB has been a step in the right direction in terms of actual gameplay, though of course it could use more weapons and armor and etc. 




 I'm gonna be sure to leave notes in front of all the dolls and ladders now :D 




 I try to update my cloud save files like, every other day, especially if I make a lot of progress.  Don't know if PS4 automatically does this by default.  Can anyone confirm?  Either way, definately worth doing it manually every now and again to be sure, and also back it up on a USB drive maybe once every few weeks or once a month, that way, you're never totally screwed. 




 There is one blood rock you can get in the main game, and I suggest you get it before you kill gherman and get booted to NG+, as then you will miss out on it, and they are very hard to come by.  NG+ doubles everyone's hp, so a +10 weapon can definitely help you feel like you are fighting with something more than a limp bread stick :D 




 Cool, glad you took that as I intended it to be read, even though I perhaps sounded a bit dick-ish at parts.  Definately.  I liked how you bowed in the first match, even in the midst of his onslaught (also annoying that you can't cancel emotes as quickly in this game), and then you proceeded to beat him in a close match.  And cheers to older etiquete, I just find it amusing when people get mad that people don't act as they insist.  Wish this game had something more implied like red sign soap stones and arenas :/ 




 Ehh, Squid headed Cthulu-esque monsters are always a visiual cue, but often it involves eldritch (sinister/ghostly) type of truths that induce madness, and that somehow bring to light the limitations of humanity and our perceptions and understanding.  Two come readily to mind:


A newer game called Darkest Dungeon on Steam (awesome by the way, and brutal like souls/BB) is heavily influenced by Lovecraft.  Hell, even a game like deadspace (all about evolution, taking humanity to the next level based on this "alien" artifact that induces a madness that believers see as truth and growth) is very Lovecraftian, even though there aren't squid-headed monsters in it. 




 Dude, you don't even want to know it!  The Eldritch Truth will drive you mad!  MAD I SAY!!!!1! 




 Not passive aggressive, I just wanted to crush his moment of triumph and  give him a heads up that it only gets worse :) 




 Yeah - a lot of Lovecraft's focus was psychological, that is, fear of the unknown, and the limitations of human comprehension, hence so much of the focus of the game is about insight, and understanding the sinister truth and perception.  Ie., can you think of a five-sided triangle?  Or absolute zero, or nothingness?  Such things might exist, but they are truly beyond us being our comprehension. 




 You do know that's not the blood letting beast that everyone has the hardest time with, right?  :P


Nice work though! 




 Dude got wreckt, and that's cool, but why would yo ube so solipsistic in the first place?  Does everyone have to play by your rules or even the community's rules either in a game, or outside in the real world?  That shit can get you killed there too :D  Also, there's something to appreciate in how that dude just ran at you all aggressive as fuck, just like the hunter NPCs, no bull-shitting around.  None of the other hostile hunters in the game stop to bow and have tea and crumpets with you bdefore starting a fight, so why should he?


Have done lots of PvP in souls games, and honestly, who gives a shit about it in BB?  It's not like we placed down red or black soap stone signs to duel, and it's not like it's hard to inflict damage. Fighting is so fast-paced, and there are so many items and weapons to utilize for fun, that both people can use, why try and put the same honor code here?  With how long it can take to even get matches, I appreciate the longer and more drawn-out fights, so long as the invaders aren't hiding in a group of NPCs, or totally shitting on both of our time in one way or another.  Don't mean to sound like a dick, but I'm sick of people complaining about this shit or other arbitrary PvP rules, especially since BB is not the same as the Souls games, and it's the perfect game to play a sleaze ball, and use all the dirty tricks in the book, and to have fun with some intense fights, and I think putting restrictions on such a game are just limiting the full experience of the PvP  :D 




 Would it upset you if I told you I killed this guy on my level 4 beastbro run?  That poison is no joke with low vitality :D  Here are some tips.


You can parry him (when he extends his arm all the way back, pretty much as he is just shooting it forward, pow, parry+visceral.)


Save a firepaper, and your oil urns and molotov cocktails for the last phase so you can stay away from the poison, and kill him ASAP.


As others have said, if you stay to his right side, locked on, always ready to dodge, he will never hit you, but again, that poison can be brutal in that last phase.

 




 Don't they aren't definitely afraid of anything? 




 PSA:  You can use the beast claw to deflect objects, including fireballs, bullets, and even the giant rocks those fuckers throw.  You can thank me later :D 




 Plz make a bloodborne movie Disney!  PLZ! 




 Eh, but same thing goes for the rest of the souls games as well.  See Onebros :D 




 Was about to say, if you kill Rom before Amelia, it can bug out your game... 




 I know right?  Dude should get a room if he is gonna be spamming his bone, then he has the nerve to come at you before he even washes his hands?!  What an asshole! 




 Yeah, but the axe does group damage and crowd constrol so much better and easier, and somehow it's even quicker and more versatile.  You think they would have made the whip at least a bit quicker :/ 




 So what if you have deft little delicate hotdogs for fingers?  How do you have the strength to punch your hand trough a pig's ass and rip out its intestines?! 




 Can you confirm that guide/dlc thing? 




 That sounds like a fun fight.  I actually was sort of miffed by hemwick my first time through.  I mean, it was super easy, but it was sort of quiet and I didn't know what the fuck was goin on, in an anti-climactic sort of way.  Then I realized there was a little barnacle covered toad lady you had to whack, then another one, then she was dead and it was easy and I was like, how does this shit fit into the story?  0_o 




 Hahahaha.  Thanks for sharing. 




 I totally enjoy onebro runs or limited items/weapons and other challenge runs, but the tedium and insanity of barehanded and guitar hero controllers just sounds maddening!  I can already feel the frenzy meter rising just thinking about it, feeling a bit sick, but at least I can die human.... rooooAAARRr scREEEACH BLARRRRGHHHeeEeeeeRRRRRRRR RAOOOR! 




 And all those heavy trade-offs are why it's obnoxious that people even bitch and moan about in-game mechanics, items, and weapons that are clearly meant to be used, especially in PvP :D 




 Yeah, how dare people use in game items and weapons and intended mechanics.  From here on out, you are not allowed to use the rally system either!  Rally system is total CHEEZ mode!!1! 




 I'd defeat him with the sprint button :P

Last time I bothered to kill one of those assholes as a regular dungeon mob, he only dropped a bent paper-clip or something stupid like that :/ 




 Is there a cannon armed undead giant surrounded by dogs and undead with a bellmaiden nearby dropping spiders on your face?  That one has been, my, uh, favorite one so far... 




 I wear it with the crowfeather garb, as the black feathers on the bone ash set better matches the crowfeather jacket.  Looks pretty sick.  The whole vibe is a nice angel of death one :D 




 Also a heads up - make sure you run it blind with no spoilers/help/etc., as, yes, the level design is awesome, but it also hides how short and straight-forward the game truly is :/ 




 Goddammit lock ness monstah, I dun told you I aint givin you no tree'fiddy! 




 Eh, say what you will, but Dark Souls 2 was still the best game of 2014, and still gave FROM fans a bajillion hours of entertainment for both PvE and PvP, and still had the best fashion souls and PvP to date of the whole series.  BB would be closer, if not for the lousy match-making and load times and lack of multi-player options and covenants. 




 What you're describing is Dead Space, almost :D 




 U stoopid newb got reckt!

Just kidding :D

Yeah, if only we did something more useful with some of our spare time...man, the amount of souls knowledge and trivia up there is the reason I can't remember people's names anymore :) 




 That wasn't just you.  That was everyone.  DaS PvP was an economy of backstabs, and a lot of lag :D 




 There are covenants in this game?  :D 




 Being human itself allowed summons, bonfire kindling, etc, and also raised your resistances, and the humanity stat itself also increased your item discovery, aside the other affects of AR for certain weapons of ETC.


Point is, I had that thought as well (about insight doing more or being linked to idiscovery), but it would need a better balance.  In general, insight needs more of a purpose in game... 




 And then you join scientology, and they take all your echoes in tax-deductible donations, and the brain-sucker slurps out all your intelligence and free will!  Totally spot on! 




 dON'T GIVE UP SKELETON! 




 Well, I like the idea, and it would balance out since not everyone levels arcane (and honestly, the wizard stuff equivelant in this game is kinda lame anyhow, even for some extra utility and damage), but it would need to be balanced more though - like how in DaS1, your humanity raised your Idiscovery, but you risked losing it if you died... 




 Yeah, my level 4 beastbro is kickin ass and he's half way through the main game, and its pretty much like playing the whole game ond defiled cursed chalice dungeon mode, since a lot of late game enemies and most bosses kill you in one or two hits.  My main who I just like to derp around with is around level 200 or so, so who knows why the fuck he sounds so self-righteous and upset.  What else is my main supposed to do after easily aquiring all items?  Just sit on top of 2 million souls?  Nah, spend that shit.  


The most important part of a build is focus, and then the skill to use it, and a few extra levels (even 50 of them) hardly make a difference.  Anything past a level 100-120 specialized build doesn't necessarily make the game any easier anyhow, as most Bosses can still kill you in one or two hits, and the small damage bonuses are negligible, especially since an extra 10% damage doesn't mean much on a swing, when an enemy will still take two whole swings to kill anyhow. 




 Yeah, at depth 5 chalices and NG++, I find my main wandering around with a million souls fairly easily, so I've just been pumping his levels up.  Almost level 200 on him.


I have a level 4 beastbro who I will never level, and I'm also working on two separate builds I'll keep in co-op and pvp ranges.


Edit:  Also, with how wonky multiplayer is, and how tough certain chalices are, I can safely say I miss soul memory  :P 




 And the rent is too damn high!  Wait, what...? 




 Dude.  I tried the cane last night on a new character, and I got my ass handed to me over and over again at beginning of the game, and I'm in NG++ on other toons, have beaten all the lowest depth chalices, and I even am working on a Onebro challenge run.  Sure, I don't know how to play as effectively with the cane yet, but even then, the weapon just seems so lacking, namely in whip mode.  My level 4 beastbro kicks far more ass with a hunter's axe than my canebro, and onebro is in the forbidden forest, fighting much tougher enemies.  Cane just seems so whimpy, slow, and lacks damage on its whip attacks, as they have a ridiculously long wind up time, yet don't do as much damage as the kick-ass hunter's axe halberd version, nor do they stun as easily it seems.  Am I missing something here?  Or does the cane sort of suck, namely compared to other weapons that do both 1h and 2h modes better in general? 




 Right, and this is all the more reason why they need to focus and fix those issues sooner rather than later, and we know their is a match coming on the 23rd, though I don't know if that is the announced one to supposedly optimize multi-player.  I agree with a lot of your other ideas, but game balances like that can be tweaked later, after we're done yelling "Rabble rabble rabble!" about the critical-mass multi-player problems  :D


You made a good write up though.


Edit:  Also, 2nd most important, is we need covenants that matter, covenants that carry some fun interaction, risks, and rewards.  As it stands, covenants are lame as fuck and pointless in this game :( 




 I love this game, 9/10 rating from me, but there are a few huge problems in it at the moment, and they are brutally critical for a FROM game, and they definitely threaten the longevity and replayability of Bloodborne.  The biggest problems imo at the moment are the invasion system/mechanics, lack of covenants and covenant interactions/rewards, lack of even duels or an arena type system, and the wonky, undependable multi-player system in general.

Invasions - This game needs more invasions, in more areas, even if the boss is dead.  This game was not as exciting as previous titles, as there was far less risk due to a lack of player invaders.  I think bell maidens should spawn in pretty much almost every area of the game, and they should also still spawn after the boss is dead.  *I'm not even a fan of invading or invaders, but I still enjoy the mechanic, because it creates even more of a threat, and adds another delicious layer of fear, precaution, and excitement.*  I myself much prefer soapstones for dueling and arenas, and on that note:


There needs to be better, non-penalized dueling systems (ie, no -30% health penalty).  There should be bells for even-matched duels and fight clubs, as well as an arena system implemented.



Multi-player in general needs to be better, faster connections, less time-outs, and insight should not be consumed until a match is found and you are actually placed in another's player world.


There needs to be covenants in this game, along with all the risks and rewards of being in them.  Oh, there are covenants in this game?  You could have fooled me!  :D


Those are my biggest gripes for now, never mind any of the other critiques.  Still give the game a 9/10 because it is a fantastic game, but the issues that are there for the moment are very fucking glaring and unforgivable in a game like this.  I almost want to say, FROM could have or should have known and done better :(



Edit:  And yes I agree - frenzy is a goofy ass mechanic that needs some tweaking.  Bleed was cool and functional in DaS, negligble and useless in DaS2, and the equivelant in BB is just OP and WTF and kind of stupid...

 




 I don't know why a bunch of random assholes are downvoting you for no apparent reason, but you're right, it's definitely more fun than a heart attack, but not as fun as say, an aneurysm  :D 




 Create a level 4 beastbro for a challenge run?  Or some other type of chalice run?  That's the only other thing at the moment, other than what you mentioned and playing more NG cycles...  or, maybe trying new builds, or something besides quality/ludwig's.


That being said, hopefully they patch multiplayer soon...


other than what you mentionedLevel than what you mentioned and NG cycles and more chalice dungeons... 




 Yeah.  I think that's a pretty dumb way of calculating damage for viscerals... 




 How would you redo the character?  I mean, don't get me wrong. To really go for it ya really gotta use everything in your arsenal, and sometimes it's the environment, so no biggie there.  




 No summons for a true beastbro run for some, but the true deciding factor is not leveling. I managed to get Amelia on my second go, but I burned up my last 3 fire papers and used a few molotovs as well, as well as 10-15 blood vials. I'm currently getting destroyed in forbidden woods. The dogs just fart in my direction and my HP melts. Just lost 70k souls too, which is a lot. After amelia though, id recomend going to cainhurst ASAP to get blood chunks. You can at least get your weapon up to +7 or 8 if you're lucky. 


That being said, if you're around to night, I'd be willing to help u with Amelia in true Beastbro fashion, that way some higher level isn't doing the wimping for you. Let me know.  




 Yo dawg, I heard you like dreams, so we put dreams in a dream, so you could dream that your dreaming while you're dreaming about dreaming. 




 You cheesed him behind the graves and objects though :|


If we're bragging here, I beat him in one go on my first attempt with my level 4 Beastbro.  No, it was not gracious, as I had to do a lot of running and dodging in the last phase, but yes - most of his attacks will still kill you in a one to three hits with a level 4 at 10 vitality too, but don't worry, all enemies and bosses will be killing you with one shot later on in the game. 




 Welcome to Camera Souls, where the most difficult enemy you will ever fight is the camera, and he follows you into every boss battle!


(Seriously though, the camera has always been an issue in these games) 




 So this was right before he beat you to a bloody pulp with his sack of dead hookers, huh? 




 Uh, I thought Yharnam sprang up on top of the labrynth - as a result of blood healing and the further experiments with the splits in the school of thoughts from Byrgenwyrth?  Ie., Yharnam came to exist and thrive because of the blood, rather than being incidentally infected with it?
 




 Dude, after several playthroughs with a dozen other toons, for whatever reason, my mage could not make it up that one arch with the two silver archers shooting him for the life of me!  And the last time I tried, a fucking black vagrant spawned right in the middle of the arch, blocking the path, and it proceeded to 1-shot me!  Good times! 




 Well, I think the weapons they do have are pretty great, and I'd take one or two unique weapons over a whole table of 20 axes that are virtually the same (aside fashion, of course), but still, give us a few more chunks and/or rocks in each play through or whatever so we can at least play around more with the few weapons that are there :D 




 Dude.  She plays it like she's one tough crow, but really she is a super sensitive softy and she's super pissed that you didn't talk to her when she was leaning against that fence that one time... 




 Or just run straight through it all :D 




 Well. What about the 3 dozen or so baby great ones up near the upper ward and orphanage?  They all are drawn to where Ebriatis is - seemingly pining to get back to what is possibly their mother. 


Edit:  or are those Kin babies?  Like a precursor?  Because as a baby squid genuinr great one, we look muh different than the models used as ariannas baby. 


Also. By true ending they mean it is the only ending in which you truly transcend the hunt. The other two endings have u repeat it in some capacity. 
 




 Did you kill Ron the funky caterpillar?  It so, you are blocked temporarily from going back there.  




 Thanks. It's a bummer to hear they made experimentation harder in this game. Shit, I'd rather get blood stone chunks instead of mad men's knowledge :/ 




 You bet. I'm looking forward to it. Also, did you hear that they might be turning it into a movie? 




 For the chalice dungeons?  Yeah. I found a lot of the info on the spread sheets to be inaccurate or incomplete:  one dungeon had an extra rune in it, and another one said the blood rock is on level 2, but it was really on level 3. 


Or, do you mean you've found blood rocks in  each of the dungeons, and now when you try to go to a different glyph dungeon with a bloodrock supposedly inside, you find he madmen's knowledge in its stead? 




 Haha.  I'm sort of in the same boat.  I bought the PS4 as an Xmas present for myself, then played destiny for a few hours before I quit because it was a totally shit game, but then I got into the last of us, played it on and off for a few weeks, and I haven't picked it up since.  I was just thinking recently, *"I should go to youtube and finish up the rest of the story,"* as I tend to agree with you - shooters with controllers suck, and as fun as those sort of mechanics are in general, I tend to tire of them pretty quickly.  Sure, it's kinda fun to stealth around and bash peoples heads in and fight off zombies, for a bit, but then it just starts feeling redundant, and now that BB is out, I don't see myself going back to finish the game.  I'll definitely look up the rest of the story soon! 




 I took out the master race thing, and just put "PC gamer."  It's not about being better than, but if I can play a game on a machine that performs and displays the game better, I will at every chance I can get, which means I will always choose a PC unless the game is an exclusive like BB.  As for the achievements, again, I personally don't care or see the importance unless it's a challenge run (again, for the fun of the challenge, not the badge), or unless it unlocks more content or in-game items. 




 Have you played the last of us?  It's the only other game with it for PS4 (dice it's exclusive). Definitely a solid story game, a once in a generation type experience.  




 Are you a PC gamer?  If so, that is probably why :P


I'm a PC gamer myself, so I don't get the point of it either. The only reason I really see achievements mattering is when it actually unlocks more content or gives ou ingame rewards :D


Edit: I totally get challenge runs and stuff like that, but there aren't any Cheevos in BB for completing those. They're just little badges saying you completed parts of the main PvE game.  




 Do you need red jelly?  It unlocks as a purchasable item in the insight store, but I don't know the trigger for it. 

Edit - also, you should be able to find enough in the main game to open the chalice dungeon in the first place.  




 Really?  Fuckin aye!  I've been wanting to play that game so I am super happy to hear that!  Now I feel like the Bloodborne Player is starting to pull its own weight a bit more, and maybe I can stop calling it that :)


Edit:  But when will they make a new GoW game?  




 If you have the disposable income, sure it's worth it, but if not, I'd say don't do it if it's gonna stress your wallet.  There is The Last of Us remastered for PS4, which is definitely worth checking out and a great story of a game, but so far there are no other solid exclusives, or at least, games you can't play on other systems, and most games play better on PC anyhow.  Before BB, my PS4 was basically like a fancy paper-weight.  Maybe some more exclusives will come out (and next gen god of war plz?!) to make me think more highly of PS4 :D 




 In the pre-set dungeons?  No, there are no blood rocks in those, all the way down to the final boss :/ 




 Lots of people have already completed Level 4 Beastbro runs (onebro equivelant in this game:  lowest level you can be with no leveling, though any base starter class qualifies so long as you don't level for the most part).  


I'm working on one right now, and I'm just coming up on Shadows of Yharnam after clearing Cainhurst, and I can tell you that at 10 vitality for waste of skin starter class, most enemies and bosses kill you in one shot anyhow, so I don't see a vitality of 7 being all too different  :D 




 People need to shut the fuck up and mind their own business.  It's become way too common for people to interfere and be nosy with how other parents choose to raise their children.  There are far too many incidences of people misjudging a situation (which they have no business in, in the first place), say, seeing a kid being left in a car (on a perfectly cool day) for a minute, and calling the cops on the parent, even though the parent was just running in and out of the store for a quick minute.  Or god-forbid, you see a child playing outside, and someone calls the cops just because a parent isn't hovering over them.


The point is, all you pushy, needy, helicopter parents out there need to stop turning your children into pussies.  You're fucking ruining your kids.


 




 Statistics show that most children who are abducted are kidnapped by relatives and friends of the famly.  I'm more wary of the strangers I know than the strangers I don't knot.  Stranger-danger was bull-shit hype.  Of course, shit happens, but such is life. 




 Stranger danger is bull-shit anyhow.  The majority of children are abducted by family and friends of the children.  Don't worry so much about the strangers you don't know, worry more about the ones you do know.  Of course shit happens, but that's life, and more power to the parents, but I totally get the concerns.  Alls it takes is one nosy-ass shit-head who can't mind their own business, and bam, you have family services or cops called when your children are perfectly fine.


Fuck this generation of pushy, needy, over-emotional helicopter parents.  They're only serving to weaken the species, turn little boys into little girls, turn all children into total sissies, and hindering the future of the current generations and our country. 




 Clawmark.  I often use the +30% and +20% ones.  Nothing like killing Gherman on NG+ in 4 visceral attacks.  That, and the +15 and +20% stamina ones.  For the oath runes, imo, the hunter's oath rune is the only one that doesn't suck balls.  I'm totally bummed Eileen got killed by Henryk on my level 4 beastbro run, so now I'm gonna be stuck using the shitty executioner rune :/ 




 I agree.  I feel like Micolash was a wonky version of this.  It was so... anti-climactic. 




 Dude - you saying you don't like the Bag-Lady-Cultist look?  I rocked it for awhile until I put together Bone Ash and Crowfeather sets for a reaper vibe.  Though my level 4Bro is Lemmy fucking Kilmister, so he doesn't even need fashion to be awesome. 




 It's definitely not insight.  My level 4 Beastbro had over 10 insight before killing BSB, and they definitely don't spawn until after you kill the BSB. 




 I'm pretty sure you have to find her first before you kill Father G, as later, part of her dialogue is, "So you killed father G huh?" 




 So no one is sure if we are limited to one blood rock ever for each dungeon type?  Ie., I alrready collected 3 blood rocks from each of the loran, Isz, and Pthumerian dungeons.  Does that mean I will never find a blood rock in one of those types again, even if I use different glyphs?  (The three I found were using other people's glyphs, I have yet to explore the ones I originally created myself). 




 Yes, you can get blood rocks from the lowest depths chalice dungeons.  So far I have looted an additional three blood rocks from the lowest root loran, pthumeryn (sp), and isz chalice dungeon glyphs (two from the reddit spreadsheet, and one from fextralife), though I don't know if these are limited, ie., I don't know if you are limited to one bloodrock ever per chalice root type just like you are limited to one blood rock per play through for the main game, or if you can keep running different variations of a root chalice to farm blood rocks.  Can anyone confirm?  Thanks. 




 The level design in both games was awesome, and in bloodborne, the awesome design definitely hid how straight-forward and linear the game really is, though once you learn the maps in either DaS or BB, areas that once seemed sprawling and large really aren't sprawling or large at all.  Even if you have a few wider areas, most places are enclosed between walls and pits or fairly straight-forward paths.


That being said, I thought the variations within BB were pretty great, from gothic cities to the woods, to the nightmares, to the dungeons and so forth, but I'd rather them keep it focused, rather than trying to cram in a volcano world or any other number of cool environments that might not have fit, though hey probably could have implemented a marsh for sure, and maybe a snowy area (more so than the outside of Cainhurst castle which is very small).  Still, I'd rather see it focused like bloodborne, rather than overly ambitious and thus lacking in feeling and atmosphere.  Even then, Dark Souls design suffered a bit past Anor Londo due to time constraints, and DaS2 was definitely stitched and connected together the poorest out of all the games, though the areas (often small) were still fun to explore the first time around.  



The problem is imo, Dark Souls is just one hell of a game to live up to, and it was so new and fresh and unseen in the gaming world (not including DeS here), whereas BB in all its different glory, is still sort of more of the same.  I bet if BB had been released first, and DaS came years later, we would be saying BB was better, because it made such a large impression on us, and you just can't beat nostalgia and that virgin feeling for games like this. 




 I think the statues are statues in yharnam, as they have base stands, and are very repetitive and numerous, and they are also larger than hunan size. The statues in yahr'gul do indeed look like people who were turned to stone just like pompei as they were fleeig for their lives, and this all happened when the nightmare ritual was completed after Rom's death (there are many indicators and notes in game hinting that rom is blocking communication with the great ones, ie, the lake is mud, the byrgenwyrth spider keeps the master (great ones) from us (the cultists), the spider is hiding the rituals)  nd even his name vacuous somehow indicates he is absorbing/blocking the red moon and the rituals)The rest of the people in yahr'gul look like they were fused together into massive lumps of human-flehipedes. It sort of reminds me of the way philosopher stones were created in the series fullmetal alchemist - you had to sacrifice a lot of people for that shit, and it is possible it was the same in yahr'gul.  




 I would ignore them, as the depth 3 ones are lacking in challenges and rewards IMO. By the time I completed the standard dungeon progression, I had more than enough materials to make 3-4 depth 5 glyph dungeons, and plenty of insight to buy more materials, and I quickly obtained 3 blood rocks in one day as well as the top tier of all my favorite runes. 


Edit; as for the challenge, there's nothing like fightin a cannon armed undead giant as a regular enemy that is surrounded by dogs while a bell lady sends endless waves of red asshole spiders at you :D 




 I'm just glad iframes are no longer tied to stats :D


That being said, the worst thing to me about dodging while locked on isn't the movement, but some of the terrible camera angles, especially for large enemies. Staying locked on can be super handy, especially to take advantage of openings and to put yourself in favorable positions, but I've died more to the camera angles than the actual bosses themselves :/ 




 Thanks for the ideas and tips. Going to cainhurst ASAP is a great idea. Sad to hear viscrals are out the window, but I've still been using parry for the free attack window and to ease the pressure off, but the difficulty has definitely has ramped up after Amelia. I don't think I have the patience for this shit tonight (I just died 5 times in a row in the same spot, mostly in one hits from the big axe guys). I think I'll play my main and go spill some blood in the chalice dungeons to unwind -_- 




 Did you get the bloodrock to +10 your weapon?  There is one in the main game in each playthrough.  I missed it on my first no help/spoiler/solo/blind run through, and NG+ was a bit harsh at first, and having a +9 weapon for most of it definitely sucked :D 




 My pro-tip - dodge/roll/strafe to any bosses right side, just get the timing right for their attacks, and never get greedy, and you can pretty much kill every boss in this game that way (aside the ones you should shoot to parry)...especially this asshole.  He once gave me a lot of problems and had me against a wall for a minute, but now he is trivial and I have farmed him several times, including his funky ass...sick version.  (Same method for Parl/Loran Darkbeast by the way) 




 Eh, even then, not all 5's and 6s and 10-20s are created equal.  I forget the exact way they said it was calculated...but yeah, gems in this game are kind of obnoxious :/ 




 Dude.  I've gotten a bunch of rocks from various dungeons, but I have never seen a chunk to date, and that's with running all the lowest depth dungeons and root dungeons  




 Dude.  You say that now, but when you see the new saw cleaver soaps.... 




 No parries?!  Why would you do that to yourself?! 




 Dude.  Don't get me started.  Sinh's stupid fucking 20 mile-span wonky ass hit box that one-shots you while being a mile above your head is total bull-shit   




 Did you use +flat damage gems on your weapons like raw enchants from previous titles?  Or did you use +%physical damage?  Did you experiment?  If so, which gems come out to be more total damage towards end game for Bloodbros?  Also, what were some of the most useful rune setups you found?  I have a few in mind, but I'll have to see how they play out.  Also, how dare you speak unfavorably about the Great Axe of Cheese!  It served you well!  It loves you!  It wants to make mutant alien babies with you! 




 But I thought you can't use the burial blade cuz of stat deficiencies?



Also, I have a few questions for you if ya don't mind.  It is a post of mine yet to be published that I copied/pastrad in draft form that I plan on putting up soon, once reddit stops giving me it's bullshit "you can't do that message:"



So, I just killed Vicar last night (Reindeer dog bitch ruined my no-death kill streak, then Hynrick proceeded to kill Eileen, and then me repeatedly), so I'm not too far into the game, but I was curious for the OneBros who are further in the game or who have beaten it, what has been your best option to pump up your damage, especially for visceral attacks?  For example, Even with a +3 or 4 hunter's axe with the only gems I have at around +2 or 3% physical attack, my viscerals on Heynryk were only doing around 100 damage, and that dude has a few thousand health, so I set that fight aside for later, though I'm pissed I can't get the only Oath rune worth a damn in this run-through, but I digress.



Another question in line with this is - has anyone found a build (combo of runes and gems) to really maximize visceral damage, and make it more worthwhile?  I mean, either way, it is a valuable move anyhow to buy time and avoid direct combat/damage, but I'm wondering what the end game numbers can look.



That being said, anyway, how does the damage look later on in the game with more options?  Ie, the +flat damage blood gems are pointless on say, my main high level toon with pumped STR/SKL, but for those who have come across the +flat damage gems on their onebros, do they wind up being the equivelant of Raw type enchants for your higher level weapons, and thus are better for OneBros?  I mean, I don't have any yet to calculate it myself (and no clawmark runes to pump damage either), but does anyone have the stats or info on how a +9 or +10 weapon on a OneBro looks damage-wise, specifically whether or not +% runes or +flat damage runes wind up being better?  Thanks in advance for your input, and any other tips or tricks are welcome as well. 




 Ah, ok, that explains why it seemed so wonky, as i'd double tap share to start recording, and it would seemingly then not record my next actions (ie, killing father G and cleric beast on 4Bro first attempts ) 




 Dude.  BeastBro all the way.  FourBro just doesn't sound right :D
