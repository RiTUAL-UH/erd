 Pontypool blew my mind.  There's also this really bizarre one called Resolution.  The Devil's Pass  - based on the Dyatlov Pass incident.  All sooo good. 


































 Barlene!  A kitten, hat-off, huh? (like a dance off. but with kittens and hats instead of my sweet moves)

 My dog, Gregory,  does the head tilt.   Bruce is kind of a weird one.   Perhaps he was a dog in another life.  His favorite thing to do is play fetch with this random ceiling fan chain.  Only that chain though.  He will run for it and bring it back compulsively.  Adorable.
