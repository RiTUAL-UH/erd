 Thanks for reminding me! I forgot to put my NYX eyeliner in my product list haha. i have tried filling my brows in countless times, but the brow pencil I get is either too light or too dark :-/ 

I will look into the eyebrow pomade you suggested in hopes that my eyebrows will look more even. Thank you so much! 




 Products used-

Primer: TwoFaced Primed and Poreless

Foundation: iT Cosmetics Celebration Foundation

Lips: Burts Bees lip crayon in Hawaiian Smoulder

Eyeliner: NYX liquid liner 









 Urban Decay Vice palette please 




 iT cosmetics celebration foundation! How well does it conceal blemishes and dark circles? I've watched various YouTube reviews but none of the reviewers have bad skin like mine. Is it worth the buy?  




 I seem to look "too washed out" at school every day. I usually do just a winged liner and a slightly tinted lip balm. I've noticed that when I wear red lipstick I pop out more, but still I look very plain. Are there any suggestions anyone can give me to stand out more? Any criticism is welcome! 




 If we do adhere to the banshee theory, in certain cultures banshees are know as harbringers of death. Meaning: Their screams tell you when someone is going to die. I would be very careful, they might be trying to warn you, and since you happened to have a warped engine you could have gotten into a serious accident. Watch out OP! 




 I'm from Cary and I remember hearing this!! I was only about 11 or 12 but it scared me so bad I didnt go to sleepovers. I'm sorry for your loss though :( 




 He showed up at school on valentines day with a 6ft stuffed rabbit, sang me a song asking me to prom and offered to pay for my ticket, dress and any accessories I wanted. I thought he was just trying to be kind, and at prom I introduced him to my friends as "just a friend". Little did I know he harbors a ginormous crush on me and I was too oblivious to realize it until the summer when he moved away  




 My dad told me this story as I left for a summer camp that would be held in UNC Chapel Hill's dorms. He told me when he attended university he had three suitemates. One of them was never around as he took night classes. The other was my dads close friend and the fourth guy (Mike) was an ROTC nut. So the say the suites are set up is that there's French doors separating each suite and the French doors had giant windows which people usually covered with curtains or posters. So mike was OBSESSED with pushing the red button on a nuclear submarine so he could start a war, and he constantly told his suitemates this. He also got drunk every Friday night and went out to fight with black people, and this made my dad and his suitemates to never want to talk to the guy. One night Mike comes home wasted and bloody after a night of fighting and my dads like "k cool whatever". My dad goes to his room to study and out of nowhere Mike's hands punch through the window and grab my dad. He takes his lamp and throws it at mike and runs out into the hallway where a VERY intoxicated Mike then calls my (hispanic) dad a "filthy nigger" and tell him how he's going to "gut him like a fish". My dad bangs on the RA's door and begs him to let him in. The RA then calls campus police, and I shit you not, it took FOUR cops to hold him down. My dad said mike went to a mental institution the rest of the semester and when he came back he had totally forgotten (or pretended to forget) that he tried to kill my dad. What a great way to start off freshman year!

 It legit made me cry and shake with anger. I feel so bad for the fathers friend. 




 Also, in Japan everyone is Japanese. I have been here as an exchange student for 5 months and the only foreigners besides my fellow classmates are the occasional tourist. 




 Kyoto, Japan 




 That people with eating disorders are "tragically thin" and will remain beautiful throughout their disease. Thats not true at all. You won't be beautiful when your skin, nails and teeth turn yellow from malnutrition and you wont be pretty when you lose clumps of hair and basically shrivel up into a brittle shell of the person you used to be. Oh, and eating disorders do not only affect women, but men as well. Awareness is the only way to end the cycle. Love yourself and your body.  




 When will you know what you want to do as a profession? I have to apply for college in a few months and I dont know what I want to major in and what field of work I want to work in and the uncertainty makes me so anxious 




 Snapbacks, sagging backs, air jordans and a vocabulary that consists of "swag!" and "YOLO!"

 My city is the home of the KKK, isn't that just lovely 




 I was so relieved that someone told me, and in English no less. Its been weird not seeing many foreigners in Kyoto except in the touristy areas. So far my stay has been amazing despite the incident but my host program not requires every participant to go sightseeing with an adult (before we could do whatever we want as long as it followed our families rules and the counties rules). Needless to say although my classmates were spooked by this, they're a little peeved as well, but are glad I am safe. Thanks for the wishes though! 




 Yeah I brushed it off initially because it was at Kinkaku-ji temple, and if you look it up you will see it is visually striking. So I thought to myself "ah, I'm standing in a good area, he just wants good pictures like me!" I was very very wrong. 




 Oh yeah, I've gotten SO many high school students asking to take pictures with me and I find it quite funny. But this just...this creeps me the hell out. 




 To give some background information let me first start off by saying this has left me constantly looking over my shoulder. 

This June i travelled abroad with an exchange program in Japan where i would be a host student and study at a local highschool for 8 weeks. My host family had taken me to the sights in Kyoto and Osaka but there were a few places we hadn't gone yet. On Saturday we decided to go to a famous temple in the area and only me and my host father went since my host sister was at volleyball practice. My host fathers hobby is photography so he brought his DSLR camera and a bunch of lenses so we could get the best shots possible. We arrived at the temple and there was a good mix of Japanese and gaijins (for those of you who dont know, a gaijin is a foreigner). We proceeded to buy our tickets and enter the temple and my host father whipped out his camera and started to take pictures of the landscape and candids of me as well. 

Pretty soon i realized people were staring at me and i paid no attention to it since it looked a bit strange for an American girl to be walking with a Japanese man. I brushed off the weird glances as i was captured by the temples beauty! As i was taking pictures on my phone, an english man next to me taps my shoulder discreetly and says "there is a man following you taking pictures of you miss, be careful"
I laugh and tell the man that it is only my host father who is taking pictures and the man turns ashen in the face and says "no, not him, the man is BEHIND your host father. He has been taking pictures of you the whole time while neither of you are looking!" 

At this point m heart begins to race and as i turn around i see none other than a short, chubby, asian man holding a digital camera- thats pointed right at me! I act nonchalant and walk to my host father and try to explain the situation but my japanese is not advanced enough to give him the full story. The only thing i can muster out is "chikan" (pervert in japanese) and point discreetly to the man following me. My host dad, who is a whopping 6'2 man, walks over to the creepy guy and converses with him in japanese and gets him to hand over the camera then runs for his life to the temple exit. Much to my surprise the SD card is full of pictures of ONLY me, and they progressively get more creepy. There was even a picture that he somehow snuck from under my skirt which i didnt even notice.

 We contacted the temple's security and the local police and they are investigating and promise to return with more information. Although there was no harm done to me i feel constantly paranoid that now everyone is taking pictures of me or that i will somehow see this man again on the train or bus and that this time he won't settle for pictures up my skirt... 
























 Wow that color looks so good on you! My only recommendation is to make sure to either line your lips with pink liner or to use a concealed pen to outline your lips so the lipstick doesn't run, because its really noticeable when bright colored lipstick is getting a bit messy  




 Super late to ask, but do you find writing with a pencil/pen hard to do?  




 If you have an instagram check out cosplayer Chloe Dykstra's instagram (@chloedykstra)! She did this AWESOME makeup for Lisa Frank about a month ago, like it was spot on!

 Hopefully mermaid will be a good substitute for kitties 3 

And welcome fellow newbie! 




 Ooh hello there! :) I think all us girls had the dreaded raccoon phase... I went through the emo phase and thought "YES MORE EYELINER IT SHOULD BE AS BLACK AS MY SOUL" but now I deeply regret that decision  




 IT is well worth the price! Honestly it covers so well I dont need concealer, but you have to buff well so the foundation doesn't appear cakey.

And about Coldstone, its just the way they're run, but mine doesn't require you to sing unless someone asks :P we're lazy! 

I cant believe youre a cosplayer, its do rare to find them!!! I've done Taiga Aisaka from Toradora! Yin from Darker than Black, Harley Quinn, and im working on a Poison Ivy now that I got my awesome green lipstick from Melt Cosmetics 3 




 I know, but it helps boredom when youre at school

 Well I have some Revlon colorstay that fits my budget, but for Christmas I have asked for an Urban Decay palette. I really really really want Vice3 but I have also heard that Naked2 is way better. I'm open to any palettes, really. I just want something super fun! 




 Thanks for the welcome! Where did you used to live? I currently live in North Carolina. 




 I'm an IT Cosmetics ADDICT! seriously! I have oily, sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts and I find that it really helps with coverage and doesn't gunk up my pores. 

As for hobbies, I'm pretty boring. I work at Coldstone Creamery and I like to cosplay whenever there's a convention, but other than that High school keeps me busy :( 




 Hey ya'll! I'm a southern girl who loves nothing but lipstick and a fierce winged liner. I've just started to experiment with eyeshadow as I'm only 17, and I really hope to improve my makeup skills. I always been fascinated with makeup (even though my middle school makeup made me look like a raccoon *cringe*) and I'm so eager to learn more tricks of the trade :)  




 For Christmas I'm asking for an Urban Decay eyeshadow palette. I've had my eyes on Vice3 for a looooong time, but I'm not sure sure its worth it. So MU addicts.... Whats your favorite and why? 




 I'd recommend Benefit's mascara They're Real!

Not only is it long lasting, but it also volumizes and lengthens your lashes the more you wear it :) 




 Me! I live near Raleigh in the Apex area :) 














 This is amazing! 




 Good idea, thank you so much for the advice! I have a somewhat similar concealer pencil by IT cosmetics and when I get Blow ill try out your tip 




 I love love love Blow! I just purchased it, but now I have no clue what to use as a lip liner. Do you have any suggestions? 




 Is Urban Decays "Vice" palette worth the buy? 




 Good job on the first haul! And I need to say that your cheeckbones are perfect! 




 Thank you so much! I usually do red lips and plain eye or winged liner and natural lips. You rock!
