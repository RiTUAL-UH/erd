 Obviously we will deal with the aftermath of last season but the producers have said that season 1 was mapped out to much fewer episodes as that's what was given meaning the rest of the season was padded out

So they say that season 2 will arc the entire run meaning it will be less panicked and cobbled together so am hoping for a more cohesive storyline with various arcs and can we get the Court of Owls please?

It would drive the whole thing for me not just this season but following ones as well, they're the puppet masters who will eventually reveal the killers of Bruce's parents  




 It was Mark Snow who created the original theme so hope he gets a nod in the new limited run, he also did the theme for Millennium...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Snow 




 Here's my take on his entrance in season 2

He wonders in to Falcone's house during the episode maybe at the end of the first one, he looks around an empty house with a bemused look on his face then he enters Falcone's office with the chair facing the wall

Then all of a sudden, the chair swings around like Blofeld in James Bond, it is Penguin

Zsasz thinks WTF then Penguin grins and begins a sombre laugh

Episode ends

Then next episode, Victor decides not to work for Penguin and goes solo, meaning him against Penguin and Gotham, holy moly 




 She should put too much pepper in a pot or something with her name being Pepper and how about those plants huh, could we see her mixing some herbs or making potions at some point? 




 I think Cat is the most obvious as she basically resembles her future character already but we need more Ivy action, she is more intriguing to me 




 Would be a great little nod to the Adam West series if they put an old rotary bright red telephone somewhere preferably in Wayne Manor

It wouldn't need to be anything cheesy it could be in Bruce's bedroom somewhere as the camera pans across or amongst his possessions 




 Yeah and him tossing his coin, very homage 




 Yeah like spike someone's food with poison ivy 




 We need an extensive archive of all the little Easter Eggs littered throughout the season, I for one have seen multiple bats on buildings and in smoke and obviously in the pilot with Wayne's parents on the floor shaped as a bat, then there's the leaf when Bruce fell down the hill

The Riddler ? on the cup was the most blatant one and there's the Killer Croc reference when Bruce was sketching in the book

Then the collage of Arkham that Pengy did had the speech bubble saying oink 




 Yeah but less Cat and more Pepper 




 We really need the original intro, titles and theme for the limited run if it is ever going to be worth watching, some half assed modern version will not cut the mustard with fans

We need this...

 I sure hope they give her far more screen time next season as she has barely been noticeable in the first season and the young actress Clare Foley is a great choice, very creepy but strangely alluring for a kid but largely under utilised

We need to see her pull more pranks and see her back story with her parents and what she gets up to, Ivy has just as much influence in the Batman universe as Cat but it seems Cat has gotten all the attention in season one 
























 These are the albums that got me in to dance music, the mixed ones in particular were generally some of the best ever released especially the first 5-10 which were the pinnacle golden age but in latter years they went down hill a bit and went too commercial and the mixed era died along with the brand, it still lives on but only to make Ministry of Sound money, the craft and care of the originals were something special and touched your mind, body and soul, the highest state of euphoria

These are about the best euphoric ones they ever released...

 From the season 3 finale, next season could we see Ferguson finally be convicted of attempted murder and with the net closed around her, could we see her behind bars and to make an example of her, could she be put in Wentworth?

Would be great to see her dropped down a peg or two and see her roughed up a bit with Vinegar Tits the new governor or would we need another season to finally see this happen? 




 I wonder if Jim will grow a pot belly 




 I wonder if we may see Vicki Vale who Kim Basinger portrayed at some point, a recurring reporter character would play well especially if she was feisty and snooped around a lot  




 Check out these guys, they are UK based so would serve that area but seeing as the season has done, it no longer matters that there was a massive delay in broadcasting between countries...

 Well, we have had a lot of Fish and Cat and not a lot of Ivy, poor Pepper and then there's Leslie and Montoya then there's Barbara who has been a mess all season, what were the writers thinking and then there's Victor's mistresses, Penguin's mum and various fleeting characters like Robin's mother and that's about it

Outweigh this with multiple sausages and testosterone fuelled nonsense, can we have more totty in season 2 please?

I see the writers may be having more diverse characters in season 2 so hopefully there may be a few welcome surprises in the way of sultry butt wiggling beauties 




 Bad Photoshopping 




 No pics, this is a scam 




 Yeah and Jim as the guy from The OC 




 Also, will the kids grow in to their roles as it's important to consider actor changes as well and if that will alter the show, I think the casting has been spot on and if anyone changes Riddle Man or Pengy for another actor there will be hell to pay 




 So long as she stays away from fetish whips till she gets older 




 Yeah David deserves a shot when he gets older but consistency is the key here, not every season has to be great but so long as it keeps going and the characters remain entertaining then why not
