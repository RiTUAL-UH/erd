 You look like Craig Feldspar. 




 Yes, do this! 
























 Whenever someone puts "the" before a minority.  




 This hangover is killing me. I knew I shouldn't have had that last shot, but man that girl was fine as hell. How could I turn down a drink from such a hot girl? Perks of being the Alpha I  guess. These pledges really stepped up this year. I'm impressed. They even used real handcuffs. They probably could've picked a better place to stash is though. This girl's apartment isn't very intimidating, and the blood is obviously fake. The corn syrup was a good choice, but the food coloring is too dark. Rookie mistake. 

Nothing. I guess he's still out. At least the chair is comfortable. I really have to pee though. They need to hurry this up already. I have class at noon. It's not like I was going to go anyway. 

"Hey! I have to piss! Someone come let me out already!" 

Someone's coming. The steps are soft. 

"So, you're finally awake?"

Wow. Maybe I misjudged these pledges after all. Sending a girlfriend to take care of me? What a bunch of assholes. I deserve more respect than that. 

"Tell them to come out here. They already won, so there's no need to keep the game going." 

She looks familiar. Is it the girl from last night? No, she was blonde. Why is she smiling like that? She must be stupid. 

"I already got them."

Got them? What is she talking about? This doesn't make sense.

"What? You got them?"

"Yes, your friends. I got them. They're gone. You are the only one left." 

"What are you talking about?" 

"You really don't remember?"

"Last night? No I blacked out."

"Not last night you idiot! The party two years ago."

This girl is making no sense. What party? This is so stupid. I have to pee. This girl she does look familiar though. Damn, I really have to pee. 

"Look, I have to pee. Can't you just..."

What is wrong with this girl. Women are so stupid. You can never trust them to do things right. They're only good for sex. Fucking women. 

"You, and your friends, took everything from me that night! Now I'm going to take everything from you."

She's laughing? I don't see how this is funny. This has gone too far. 

"I just want to take a shower and drink now. The game is over. I have to piss, and I have class. Enough is enough."

This day is wasted. Fucking pledges and their stupid girlfriends. 

"You still don't remember? You still don't get it? You... 
Do know I'm going to kill you right?"

"HAHAHA! Ok! You got me! I'm scared! You hear that pledges? Your little girl is really scary! Game over! Let me go now!"

"You are a very stupid person. You'll realize that before the end."

This girl. She is so... She is the girl from last night! I guess she was wearing a wig. I know her from somewhere else though. Where is she going? What is that in her hand? Is that a knife? 

"Two years ago, You and your little frat buddies decided it would be fun to... What's the phrase you used? That's right! You thought it would be fun to 'run a train' on a girl.You thought it would be fun to take the innocence of a helpless young girl for hours! Well, I would take your innocence to make it even, but you don't have any. I think I'll penetrate you for hours just like you did to me. Then, we'll be even."

Wait! It's her! It's the girl! Oh shit! Oh shit no! Oh god I'm gonna die! Oh god! 

"Are you pissing your pants? What a coward. I wonder if you'll scream louder than the others. Apparently having your dick cut off is extremely painful..."

"Wait please!"

"Too late... Asshole."


 




 "Fascist!"
