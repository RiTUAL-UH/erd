 As a part of my get healthy plan, I'm quitting soda completely for a month (I'm only assuming that's how long it will take for me to not crave it, but really I want to quit until it's not something I want to drink every day) and then after that I'm limiting myself to one, per week MAX, whether it's at home, out and about, or at a restaurant. Otherwise my drink of choice is water.

Over the last few months I let myself go and I pretty much stopped taking care of myself and drank a LOT of soda. Before I was always good at drinking it only in moderation but now every time I drink it I just feel like a fat unhealthy piece of crap. So no more soda!

What are some other healthy drinks I can have? I have a hard time trusting anything from a grocery store...everything is loaded with sugars nowadays... 




 I play WordFeud with my wife because it's something that doesn't really require a huge time investment and we can be going about our daily lives and get notified when it's our turn. then I thought, how cool would it be to have a turn based game similar to Final Fantasy I can play but be able to take a turn and then go about my business. Does such a thing exist? 




 Today I went to the dentist for the first time in 2 years. I got married 2 years ago and up until a year ago I didnt know I could still be on my parents insurance. After that I just kept forgetting to make an appointment. I hardly ever brushed or flossed my teeth but today the dentist informed me I have no cavities. He seemed frustrated because of my lack of dental hygiene and yet my teeth were perfectly fine?

What about you Reddit? 









 And I ended up using every single cable 




 Or did they for some reason remove the option to turn that off from swifkey x? 

If so that's annoying because I always end up typing too fast and delete words while I type. 














 When you click on a link to imgur, if it isn't a link to an album, and it isn't a direct link to the image, I wish that the app would load the direct link instead. Landing on imgur's site on my phone gets annoying a lot. 









 For me it's the light and fan switch in my bathroom. They are swapped. The fan switch is closest to the door and the light switch is furthest from the door. Since I spend more time in my house than anywhere else, I am now trained to flick the furthest switch to turn on the light and now when I visit friends and family I turn the fan on by instinct because I forget that everywhere else is the opposite of my bathroom. 














 He said he'd mostly be using his new PC for gaming but he also said he'd be working with things like the CryEngine 3 devkit. I know that the logical cores for hyperthreading is really only useful for encoding, but I don't know much about the CryEngine devkit. Would someone really benefit from the logical cores in the 2600k for that purpose? 



















 And why did they make the chat pad incompatible with the older style headset controllers? 

I personally find the headsets to be annoying since the volume and on/off switch have to be dangling I stead of just being attached to the controller. With the newer headsets you have to take your hand off the controller to turn the mic on or off which is incredibly frustrating and distracts from the game. If someone walks into the room and wants to talk to me in the middle of the game I can't just easily turn the mic off. 

I'd like to buy the chat pad for messaging but what's the point if I have to use one or the other? WHY MUST MICROSOFT FORSAKE ME SO? 




 I've tried setting up security on my Buffalo router but it seems like every device I own will drop and reconnect every 10 minutes or so which is really aggravating. I've never had this problem with my wifi being open though. I know I can filter approved MAC addresses but I don't want to alienate anyone who comes over with their phone or laptop and want to use my wifi. I don't want to have to find out every MAC address from people who come over, and not all of them are even tech savvy so that's not the best solution.

So now I've come to want to troll the people who are using my wifi. I don't know who's doing it because I don't interact with my neighbors too often. I thought about setting up something where they can pay $10/mo per computer they connect with that goes to my paypal, but the paranoid in me thinks they will complain to the ISP that I'm reselling their service and have them shut me down.


Another thing I thought of is to change my SSID to "I can see what you're downloading"


I messed around with some of the settings and so far, I've filtered the offending neighbor's MAC addresses so that they get a max of 1500kbps down and 100kbps up. I'm also in the process of setting up access policies for the same MAC addresses to block all p2p traffic and block websites based off of the keywords "porn" and "facebook"

What else can I do that I can chuckle myself to sleep at night?

With recent events and certain posts, I find myself wanting to scroll through and find a mod's word on the subject but not all the posts are the color they should be 




 But I'm drunk and I love the bars we have here. It's always a good time and I love going downtown at night 









 It seems like everywhere on the internet and out in the real world people always proclaim how amazing that fast food place is. I can understand liking it but anytime someone has a different opinion they are quick to attack it. Why fight over which shitty food is slightly less shitty than some other shitty food? It's all fast food, and none of it is very good. I had it for the first time last summer and honestly it didn't seem any different from any other fast food restaurant. They just have a more "efficient" way of taking orders because they have less items on the menu so people who don't know what they want don't have to stare as long. I don't understand why everyone thinks it's so amazing. I'll cook a burger on my own grill/stove any day.


**edit** Just as I expected. Don't like In 'N Out? Downvotes for you 




 So that leaves me with the only option of making home-made ranch, because let's face it, the stuff you buy at the grocery store just doesn't cut it. What home-made ranch have you made that just blew you away with its awesomeness? 




 I always tell myself I need to do this, and I need to do that, but how do I go beyond telling myself? I can never actually bring myself to do it. Every once in a while I am able to get myself to a gym and I find myself actually having a good time cycling or using the elliptical for an hour listening to my music and I enjoy myself, but despite that it's still a struggle to even get that far. I feel unhappy with my life and the minimal things I have accomplished. I feel extremely unattractive, and it doesn't help that thanks to my family's genes, all my fat accumulates in my belly, so I almost look as if I'm pregnant.


The only good thing I've felt that has happened to me in the last couple years is getting married. I love her very much and I couldn't ever possibly see myself with any other woman. Somehow she saw through any physical or mental facade I had and saw the real me. But my problem is I don't even know who I really am anymore. It is hard for me to get out of bed every morning, and if I didn't have any other obligations, I would lie in bed all day. I set multiple alarms for myself and I cancel each and every one when they go off in the morning. Even if the alarm is on the other end of the apartment. I will get up, turn it off, and go back to bed.


I eat unhealthy food and can't make myself eat things that are good for me. I feel like I'm in a cycle of self destruction and I can't get out. It's killing me from the inside but I only keep making it worse day by day. I need help, what do I do?


**edit** Thanks a ton for all the replies guys. I promise that I've read every single comment that was a reply to the post (I don't know if I'll be able to get through all the subcomments). I am indeed a very disorganized person, and people have given me links to places that can help me keep track and help me set goals for myself. The first step I am taking will be to wake up at specific times every day (save for the one or two days a week where I work until 3am). My plan will be to wake up, eat a healthy breakfast, and go to the gym. I think I'll also pay for a personal trainer so I can get some sort of workout plan since I really don't know much about the gym and when I go I just mindlessly do stuff with no direction (this will help in the goals department) 




 spoilers for anyone who hasn't finished yet (why haven't you?)


I just don't see how the "first" crew could have existed once the "second" crew decided not to open the stargate while inside the star. The only reason the first crew ever got sent back 2000 years is because they went through the stargate, so if the second crew coming through didn't go through the stargate, wouldn't the first crew not exist? 




 Every other subreddit I go to except for this one has both a link that goes back to reddit.com and then another one that goes back to the front page of the subreddit. I'm used to clicking that link to get back to the subreddit because sometimes I enter through comment replies so I have to click on the "my reddits" at the very top and then scroll to r/simcity which is a little frustrating when I don't have to do it anywhere else 









 I don't have cable TV so I had to find a stream and indeed they are airing 3rd generation Toonami. Dear god don't let this be a cruel April Fools prank 




 I can't seem to find a relevant law except in vehicles. Either it is legal or bozeman cops are extremely lax about open containers late Thursday, Friday, or Saturday nights 




 If there's one thing I don't entirely understand in SC4 is having neighbor cities. A lot of people say that the only way to really have a successful city is to have it connected to neighbor cities. I guess I just can't wrap my head around the fact that I can move one city +50 years and the other city sits dormant until I load it up. I just don't understand how that actually benefits me. 




 Looking to get some paints for my wife's birthday because she wants to get back into doing some painting. What are your favorite acrylic paints and what colors should I get? Any brand I look at I can't find "just red" or similar base colors...my wife likes to mix her own colors rather than buy tubes of pre-made colors.

 I was just waiting in line to buy a soldering iron at Radio Shack and when the old guy in front of me got up there he asked if they carried GPS blockers. When the puzzled salesman said no he asked where he could get one but the salesperson had no idea.


Do you think this was an old guy paranoid the government is tracking him every day through his cell phone's GPS? Maybe he read the stories about the FBI putting trackers on peoples' cars and he didn't want it to happen to him?

 I have a couple Renegade Ops gifts in my steam inventory and I'd like to trade for something, I don't know what though. 




 The music. Both Mass Effect 1 and 2's soundtracks have been listened to by me more than any other soundtrack, movie or game. And I'm sure that the music in the third franchise will not disappoint me. I think that they deserve my money. I know there's a whole lot of other shit going on with ME3 and EA, but I hold the value of the music very high, and as such, I will purchase the game, and I will enjoy every minute of music that is heard.


On top of that, Clint Mansell is onboard for music this time around, so it should be interesting. For those of you who don't know, he's responsible for the Requiem For A Dream soundtrack.

The only thing I have to go off of is that the original file name was "The Story" and I bet you can imagine how useful typing in "The Story song" on Google is. I'm just hoping someone else finds this song familiar because I'd like to hear more like it! It has been on my hard drive for years and I still have never heard of a source

I feel like I've looked at every single music related download on TES nexus and I still haven't found it 




 I wish I had taken a picture of the wire management before. This case has absolutely no cable management features, it was rather frustrating for a young me to get things to look nice. Having a smaller graphics card certainly helps!
[Picture of current wire management](http://i.imgur.com/NuWao.jpg)
It's not the best cable management but it is pretty much the most I can do. The only place I can hide the un-used cables is to shove them into the 5.25" slots.

[I can't believe how much smaller the 6570 is compared to my old nVidia 7800GT](http://i.imgur.com/Euvm1.jpg). It was always annoying because the power connector faced where the hard drives were and it was an extremely tight squeeze which regularly made maintenance a pain. I will never own another case where the hard drive bays face that direction again.

 Woke up out of nowhere even though I didn't get any sleep the night before. Starting to feel a bit hungover. ffuuuuuuuu

also, still drunk lol 




 What do you like to drink? What's your favorite alcohol? Do you prefer straight up shots, mixed drinks, or beer? What is your favorite drunk story? Do you drunk call, text, Reddit, or internet?

Auto correct is such a godsend while drunk!

I love fireball whiskey. I bought a whole case of it last time it was on sale. I usually drink whiskey over any alcohol. I hate beer it tastes nasty. I only drink it when I'm drunk enough that my tongue is numb so I can't taste

What do you eat while drunk? I'm quite partial to pizza!

I haven't eaten anything today so I didn't have to drink that much to get drunk! I like it that way. Less alcohol to buy. I'm at the point where my face is numb!

I don't have many stories with me being drunk because I shunned alcohol for a while. But you know what? I don't care anymore. My side job is sitting with a bus driver either Thursday, Friday, or Saturday to transport drunk people around. We usually get 70-100 people per night. That job is so easy and I'd consider myself somewhat of a pro at handling drunk people when I am sober, but I love being one of them. Its awesome when I get on the bus when I'm drunk because I dont even have to remember where I live since I'm friends with the drivers.

Thanks for reading this Reddit night crew. I love social interaction when I'm drunk despite being somewhat of an introvert. My wife and my friend and I are about to get on the bus to go downtown in 15 min 



















 Gonna throw it in my old PC with an ASUS A8n SLI Premium, AMD 4200+ X2, 2GB DDR 400. I know it's a little overkill for an HTPC but it was cheap and I had a gift code to use that was expiring soon. All I really needed was a little improved performance over my nVidia 7800GT and HDMI out with audio.

What software and hardware do you guys use for your HTPCs? I was thinking of also getting the logitech RF wireless keyboard that has the trackpad on it for $40 




 OT XI? :noes::run::greddy: 




 Now i can't get my OT fix for the night. Guess I get to browse Reddit more :/ 









 I can't seem to ever find the motivation to do anything I want to do. I just waste away and do absolutely nothing. At the end of every day I am ashamed of myself of not setting forth to accomplish the goals I set for myself and I tell myself I will do better tomorrow, and it all begins with waking up. 

I want to get around 6-7 hours of sleep, but no matter how rested I feel when I wake up, I still lie in bed, pressing snooze or even setting the alarm to a later time. I sleep until I feel tired from sleeping too much. Any plans that I had that I planned for the morning before I started my day will not get done, there is no time. I feel as though I never get out of bed unless I have an obligation to go to such as work or school. I've tried moving my alarm so it's not next to my bed, hell I've put it downstairs so I actually have to walk down the stairs to turn it off. And what do I do? I climb back in bed and sleep for another hour.

How can I convince myself that going to the gym in the morning is an obligation BEFORE I go to class? I'm overweight, out of shape, unhealthy, and eat only two-sometimes one meal a day. I want to change this. I need to wake up after 6 hours of sleep, I need to go to the gym, I need to eat healtheir, but how do I begin? 









 Everyone must either use a Bluetooth headset or a dashboard mount to talk on the phone (dashboard isn't really hands free but I'm not complaining)

Mp3 players are still allowed I guess.

 When I was a freshman in college living in the dorms, I decided one night that I wanted to go out and get some McDonalds. I had stayed up all night finishing a project and came back and slept away the afternoon and the food halls were closed by the time I woke up.

I don't usually like eating by myself at a fast food restaurant, plus I'd rather have been watching TV/sitting at the computer while eating so I got my food to go. When I got to my car I put my food on top of the car so that I could put my soft drink into my cupholder. And there's the mistake I made. The classic "order something to go, and put it on top of the car, and completely forget as you get into the car and drive off" mistake.

Of course I was completely oblivious that I was forgetting something vital to my nourishment that night as I got into my car. Not only until I got most of the way back (just outside of my parking lot) that I realized something had gone horribly wrong. But that's when I spotted it. It was a miracle, a godsend, a grand triumph. Something was flapping in the wind over the top of the spoiler on my car! Yes, you guessed it! It was my McDonalds bag of food! It slid all the way down from the top of my car, and the bulk of the weight got wedged underneath the spoiler only to have the top of the bag freely flap around.

I quickly parked my car and ran back to retrieve my spoils that I had so carelessly forgotten about in my hungry stupor. The very main reason I had left the confines of my warmly flourescent-lit room made of brick and tile. The safety of the carefully selected position of my desk. The blue glow of the lights emitting from my computer tower. Much to my surprise, the food was still very warm, and all items I had ordered were accounted for.

I rushed up the four flights of stairs to my room. Today there was a triumph. I could have lost something vital to my very identity as a human being. I devoured my meal with much vigor. The fact that it was nearly lost to the solid black rivers of transportation that we call roads made it that much more delicious. The events of tonight had truly went better than expected.

TL;DR: I put food on top of my car and left it there on accident. It got stuck under my spoiler and rode all the way home and I didn't even lose a single fry.

I was thinking about adding on another graphics card, but someone else tells me that it wouldn't be much more than a hot paperweight that costs $350 and that I should maybe invest in a full on liquid cooling system instead of the CPU cooler I currently have in the build. Any suggestions? 




 Obviously, I'm going for a gaming PC, but I also do a bit of music production and would like to do some midi orchestration.

I'm thinking I should get an SSD for the computer, and really my only requirements is that the PC have at least 16gb of RAM.

I don't need any more hard drives other than the SSD, I already have about 10tb laying around. I don't need any monitors or speakers.

Problem is, I don't even know where I should start for the build. And with black friday around the corner, I don't know what deals I should be looking for to get the most bang for my buck 




 "9-1, undefeated in conference and guess who's playing like a high school B squad? Sad day in Bozeman." 




 I recently installed the update for the appstore app and while visually the app looks great, it has been a nuisance ever since. It's all in the notifications. 

I'm fine with a notification telling me I have an update, but not allowing me to close the notification from the notification bar is just plain wrong. There's no reason why I should be forced to open the app to see that update. 

Another notification problem: the app decided to try to download an app/update even though i have it set to wifi download only. But instead of actually downloading, i had a lovely status bar in my notifications that read 0% all day long. Again, no way to close the notification and when I opened the app, it didn't even say it was downloading. 

I tried looking in the settings but i couldn't for the life of me find an option to disable notifications. I went into my Android application settings to see if I could just force close the app but even though i kept getting these notifications every hour it didn't say the app was running. That leaves my only option which is to uninstall it which I don't want to do.  




 Does anyone know how the game is going to be broadcast? We weren't able to get tickets to the game so we'd like to invite a few people to our house and watch it on our TV, but the problem is we don't have Cable TV. Just internet. Does anyone know if someone will stream the game over the internet or if it will be broadcast over the air so I can pick it up with an antenna? 
























 Some friends of mine started up a Red Power/BuildCraft combination server. Both mods work really well together. We were trying to kind of keep the spirit of minecraft but have some improved redstone stuff and basically endgame material. We didn't add IndustrialCraft because it just seems like way too much.

Anyone else use these mods? Have any cool builds you did? Unfortunately I don't have anything to share because it takes a while to get up and running! Though the high amount of gems you can use for pickaxes help a lot! that way you can leave diamonds for pipes and gears 




 I really think that something needs to be done about experience orbs. When a player dies in SMP it creates way too many floating entities. I just died on a server from a creeper and all the experience orbs just about crashed the server. I had to lag my way slowly over to where the orbs were and sit there for a whole two minutes so that I could pick up what felt like half a million experience orbs. Stuff like this CAN'T be good for larger servers with more people online and possibly more than a few dying at the same time. I was the only one online at the time of this happening, so I can't imagine what would have happened if there were more online.


When there is a lot of experience orbs in one area, they should group together and become one to a few large orbs instead of a ton of tiny ones.


As for how hard this would be to implement? I don't really know, but *something* has to be done because it's a near game-breaking thing.



I'm not always up-to-date on my minecraft news, but has Notch ever addressed this issue? If he has could someone perhaps clue me in? 




 Rifle Hunting season opening weekend was last weekend here in Montana. I brought my phone with me, as I bring it everywhere, and as I expected, there was no service up in the mountains. I was messing around with it and much to my surprise and enjoyment, I found out that my phone doesn't have an aGPS chip/unit, it actually has a standalone one, so I was able to use GPS Essentials and plot waypoints and see how far they were from my position and all that all without needing a cell phone signal. Talk about nerdgasm! I wasn't expecting to do anything on my phone but play some offline games I had.


Now this leads to the point of this post: what apps out there are good for the outdoorsman who has no wireless signal? I found that Google Maps caches some maps (I presume the surrounding area of wherever you live, as my entire city I could zoom all the way in on in Maps, but my current position was just a blur). But I'd like to go further, is there an app where you can cache maps from google maps, or load other maps into it so I can see where I am via GPS and plot waypoints to navigate through the mountains? GPS Essentials did a lot but I'd like to take it a step further. I'd like to see maps and record where I went and see how far I traveled. For some reason the tracks function in GPS Essentials only records the distance between the starting point and the end point in a straight line, instead of distance traveled. 

Another awesome thing I could use is an app where I can load maps that show me private and public plots of land. Sometimes while driving along the road we see something but we don't always know whether the land out there is private or public. 




 The wife and I are trying to find some horror movies. We always watch the same movies year in and year out during October. It's hard for us to want to stray from those movies and spend money on something that turns out to be a gorefest. The problem for me is that the horror category groups both creepy/scary movies in with slasher flicks. We like paranormal movies, not stuff like Saw. I mean some death is fine but i just don't like movies just full of people dying gory deaths. I want something that will be haunting or make my skin crawl. 

Any suggestions?  
























 I saw that this was on the known bugs section for the minecraft wiki. But it seems that of the 3 servers I play on, only the one I play the most on is having this issue. Has anyone found a temporary fix for this? 




 I made an underground tree farm in a server I play on. I noticed that when one grew, it only had one or two leaf blocks on it. I thought that was strange so I went to walk over to it and I got stuck where leaves usually are. I logged out and in only to find that the leaves did indeed spawn with the tree...but for some reason they were invisible to me. The only way for me to see the leaves to chop down the tree is to log out and in after the tree grew 














 Usually when i drink with friends I just take a shot here or there but I barely ever get a decent buzz going. So last night was the first night in two weeks I could drink and either not have to sit at home or worry about a ride home so I said FUCK IT. I wanted to take the fast track so i drank 4 double shots of fireball whiskey before getting a ride to the bars. 

I had an awesome fucking night and I don't even know why... We barely did anything! But for some reason everything was funny and everyone was amazing. If you can't tell it was my first real time being drunk. I didn't even realizz I was drunk until someone told me I was... I kept insisting I was only tipsy. I also retained the ability to use proper Grammer while drunk texting/IMing  




 Busy night tonight being it some beer festival or whatever. Last run is gonna be a shitshow 




 This compilation of mods is super awesome. I had some trouble getting it to run without crashing but it was worth it. Millenaire is one of the best mods i've seen and i don't know how I haven't heard of it til now. 

I hope towns in 1.8 are similar to how the ones in Millenaire work or else I might be a tad bit disappointed =/ 














 It seems like every time I have somewhat of an emergency the only thing available is that emergency place that costs a ton of money just for my animal to be physically looked at. At least in Billings I have a 24 hr vet to go to. 

For being such a pet loving town, the vets sure aren't very animal friendly...  




 Not sure if there are any super serious injuries but almost the entire police force has been called down there. Cool car got fucked up and took out a fire hydrant 

It's a good thing there weren't people on that corner like there usually are or it would have expected been a real bad ordeal. Happened just now at 110 AM 




 At almost any time i look at my phone is have a notification for email. It's borderline annoying. I had to turn off sound notifications for it because I get one like every five minutes. I also get annoyed with my Led blinking whenever i'm trying to go to bed. I don't want to turn off notifications because i do like seeing when i have new mail... I just get way too many. Anyone else stuck in this predicament?  









 I looked through all the daytime routes and it doesn't appear that anything has changed unless it was too minor for me to notice. Maybe times have changed but I don't think so. The only major thing is a couple buses have a half hour service for "peak hours"

Both Upstream and Downtown start an hour earlier each night (Friday and Saturday, and Thursday, Friday, and Saturday respectively). So Downtown runs between 8PM and 3AM and Upstream runs between 9PM and 3AM. Last pickup at the bars is at 2AM. As usual Upstream runs up to campus twice within the last run. Once at 1:50 and again around 2:10 (or however long it takes to get up and drop everyone off and come back)

Downtown's route changed a bit. We do not run up to the Greyhound anymore. and we do not go past Catamount and the First Student bus depot, instead we drive right between Target and Costco. We now drop off right across the street from the side of Wal-Mart instead of by the gas station across 7th Ave. And we now drive past the Filler


Maybe one day I'll see a fellow redditor on the bus!


*edit* Here is the link to the LateNight routes
http://www.streamlinebus.com/routes-schedules/latenight-service/ 




 I live in a college town and the city doesn't have any public transportation. Instead we have a bus system that started five years ago that is mostly paid for by tuition and the whole operation is ran by students, aside from the drivers and bus maintenance ... That is contracted out to a company. 

Every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday there is a bus that runs from 8 to 3am.  Our last run is when the bars close and everyone is drunk and needs a ride home. I keep them under control and make sure no fights break out and take the necessary actions if an incident does occur. I've never had anything I've had to call the cops for though... I've had relatively good luck and haven't had too many rowdy crowds. Once we fit 100 people on a bus that seats 23 to go to a hockey game 

I have about an hour to the last run right now and usually this run is pretty quiet so AMA 









 I was just wondering if anyone else uses an app on an android device for a HTPC.  

First i found teamviewer which is awesome for remote desktop which could be useful to me in the future for troubleshooting and also i thought it was damn cool that i could connect to my laptop over 3g to track progress on a download. After this i got the idea that i could use the app as a sort of remote when i connect my laptop to the tv to watch videos instead of having to either get up and lay on the floor to navigate or pill out mt keyboard and mouse and use that on the coffee table. It worked well,  however whenever i would disconnect the application would pop up with a message saying thanks and whatnot. I didnt want to stay connected with the phone for obvious reasons so this didn't work too well. 

Then i came across remotedroid which was awesome. Works like a trackpad + keyboard over wifi.. You just start an application on the computer and connect via ip with the phone app. However it gets glitchy every once in a while and i cant seem to get rid of the keyboard without disconnecting from the laptop. The other problem is that i occasionally have to ctrl + scroll up to increase text size on websites to read on my tv from the couch... And that is not possible with this app. 

So now I'm wondering... Is there any better apps out there that r/Android can recommend to me?  




 Not sure where to go with this one...bought a whole 1.75 liter bottle of Jack Daniels and want to make some barbecue sauce...anyone have recipes?

My cat got a little too playful last night and bit me pretty hard... For some reason this particular tooth mark is really bad... The others are fine. But this. One has been hurting and swollen since the moment he but me. It's difficult to move my wrist as there is a sharp pain every time i try to use my hand. I asked someone at a pharmacy and he said most likely some neosporin will help it but that was hours ago and it still is swollen and still hurts... 


So... Should I see a doctor?  




 I've been busy this summer with travelling and work and recently I've been getting the urges to start a new Minecraft world....but my only problem is knowing that there is going to be a pretty big update...and I don't want to start a new world now only to have to start another new one when the adventure update comes out...anyone else have this problem? 









 I keep seeing the same few people posting up here.  It would be nice to have a few more people up here so we can discuss local happenings! Also when is a bozeman reddit meet gonna happen? We should start throwing some ideas out there for meetup activities as well. 

Here's a couple:

Bars (obviously... But from another post I read not all of us are of age) 

Music on main? 

Follow the Pigsty and hang out where they are lol

Hike to the M

Floating the Madison 

Fishing trip?  




 The bozeman guide to drinking post said that montana spirits and wine was the cheapest... Can anyone else confirm this?  




 I saw them the first week they started up but my schedule didn't seem to meet up with when they'd be out.  Finally got a chance tonight at the reopening of the Rocking Real Bar. It was definitely some good bbq.  Cole slaw on the sandwich and all! I highly recommend to try it out if you like bbq. I'm hoping that this isn't the last food truck that Bozeman will see. I was in California for a couple weeks this month and the food trucks there were awesome and i'm glad it's spreading elsewhere. 

If you want to check out their site its at www.pigstymobilebbq.com
Follow them on facebook and twitter to find out where they will be!  









 I'm driving from Montana to California tomorrow. This is my first road trip I've ever taken. What things should I bring that could be useful or potentially life-saving?

Android appa are welcome as well! 














 When I receive a new MMS with either music or a picture in it, when i view the picture and then press the back button to go back to my inbox, the screen turns white for a second and then goes back to the picture/song. The only way to get out of this is to press the home button..any idea what's up? 







































 If people come to your door selling magazines in order to go on a trip, and they look around 25 years old and talk about "points". Call the police immediately and tell them the direction they went in. Do not let them come into your house to fill out forms under any circumstance. I managed to get my entire wallet stolen with lots of personal information. I've just spent the last 2 or 3 hours cancelling my cards and talking to the police. They mentioned being in Billings so it seems that they are moving West. I'm hoping that by posting this I can make more people aware and hopefully I'll be able to get my wallet back because it's long gone once they leave Bozeman.


*EDIT* I found a site with pictures of the people going door to door:

 I'm trying to get a bunch of raw materials so I'm doing some strip mining but I'm finding that it's an incredible pain because I'm interrupted by baddies every 30 seconds that spawn off-screen. I guess lighting the place up doesn't help, I've been placing torches every 6 blocks, horizontally and vertically. I'm starting to think that right now my best option is to create vertical walls that are just under the width of the screen so that they can't come bother me while I'm working 














 I was recently talking to someone about spaceship design and we discussed how 99% of all games/tv shows/movies don't portray ship movement right and suddenly I had a moment of nostalgia and remembered that demo of that awesome game that never really got released from so long ago. Nexus was still good but it never lived up to what IG3 was supposed to be and the gameplay felt kindof shallow compared to how complex IG3 was. And if you ask me, even when the demo came out, the game was way ahead of its time, especially in the regard to particle effects



Here are some screenshots:

I'm just wondering if anyone else gets in the same nostalgia boat that I'm in whenever I think about this game. It's the same one where we mourn great games that never got to see the light of day. (though this one in some form sortof did). I just tried to install the demo and play it again for old time's sake but alas, the installer won't work on Windows 7 =\ 
























 Is there somewhere where I can suggest this? I like to have my apps auto update but they always seems to do it in the middle of the day while I'm at work where I'm essentially in a Faraday cage so it drains my battery. I don't use WiFi update because my home WiFi is unreliable and using 4g is actually faster and I have unlimited data still so I have no need to use wifi 














 I have no idea what's going on :\

 It's not that it's not exporting a number of tracks, it's picking and choosing which audio sources to export instead of all of them. It exports the sound from the video intro which is on track 2, and it will export the audio attached to the video which is on track one, but the song I've added at the end of the video will not render, no matter which track it's on. playback is fine within premiere but the audio is lost during encoding.

I don't understand how I can make a bunch of videos but suddenly have the audio for the same song I've been using get left out of rendering 














 The last two videos I tried rendering, the 3rd audio track isn't being rendered at all. I can't seem to even find anyone having similar problems via Google. Help? 














 Eventually I'd like to just get a remote for XBMC alone, but I also use my HTPC for browsing the web from my couch and I want to know what everyone else thinks is the best for couch browsing.

I currently have a Logitech K400 but the build quality leaves something to be desired. I've had it for over a year and the little notch on the on/off switch already wore off so it's pretty hard to turn the keyboard on and off now. The mouse buttons feel like you're barely pressing anything at all...it just feels like there is no affirmation that you actually pressed the mouse button. And on top of that, for the first year I just had the wireless dongle connected to one of the front USB ports on the PC and it worked fine from anywhere in my livingroom and even the kitchen, but now that's not good enough and I had to get a USB extension cord to bring the dongle up higher in the room so my input would stop lagging or outright not responding. 




 For me it would have to be family features and sharing. If I have two Xboxes, I can play one game downstairs, and my wife can play another in a different room, but with Steam, only one device can be logged in at a time, so that means only one of us can play any game at a time. I don't really like the idea of having to pay twice for a game unless we are going to play online with each other at the same time, but many games we buy, we don't play online, or there isn't any online.

There are two different ways I can see this happening:

1. They allow multiple devices to be connected to the same steam account on the same IP. So that means my computer upstairs can still be connected to steam while the one on our TV is also connected to Steam. Obviously, if one game is being played currently, the other computer would either be able to screenshare/observe the other player or play a different game.

2. Sharing games with different family accounts (maybe also linked to your same IP). Basically the same exact thing as above except the other computers don't have to be logged into the same account, just one that is linked with the main account. 


I think my biggest peeve with the current way Steam works is that when I open steam in my livingroom, I have to type my password again when I return to my main PC, and then when I go back downstairs again, I *again* have to type my password. It gets tiresome.

So Reddit, what are features you would like to see implemented into Steam?

I'm still real slow at editing video as I haven't really done a lot so I was up pretty much all night getting this together. On top of that I was adjusting the brightness so you could actually kinda see when the nightvision isn't being used. Hopefully we'll get to more episodes soon! 









 I got some discounted, pre-seasoned country style pork ribs the other day and I don't have the time to properly smoke/grill them so I'm going to use a slow cooker. 

But for the sake of saving money and producing more food in a variety, I was hoping someone could provide tips or insight to doing a bit more, like having more meat but not just adding more pork ribs.

Has anyone ever done such a thing and does it turn out well? something I was thinking was adding some different kinds of sausage links to the mix so that those will slow cook as well and I can either go onto reheating them another day to just eat on a bun or slicing them to use in another dish. I want to get the most out of the onion and peppers that will be in the crock pot 




 I'm visiting the area for a wedding and saw that all the machines in the Tilt had pricetags on them so I'm not sure if they're going to be closing or what. Unfortunately I don't remember the prices or all the games but some notable mentions are DDR Ultimate, Initial D, Tekken 4, 5, and Tag, and Star Wars Pod Racer. I just saw a recent post on my front page showing some stuff for sale and thought I'd share my find. 














 I've been trying to play single player and get used to everything before I jump into a server and get roflpwned by someone before I even get started.

What is the best strategy to get going? I built a small ship up with lots of mining lasers after a long while to the point where I could mine entire asteroids but even then I wouldn't get a whole lot of money from selling all that stuff. I always hear pirate hunting is good too, I equipped my ship with some shields and I had quite a large amount of lasers but I wasn't able to take down a pirate at all so I ended up getting my ship destroyed 




 Is anyone else getting this? 




 I'm building a station that requires 12 of these to be docked with it and it will act as a refueling station. My goal is to get it docked with the station without consuming any of the fuel (aside from RCS for docking)

No matter what I do, I seem to come up short of establishing an orbit because of the weight.

 I can't believe they cut one of the main SB lots that students use in half just so they can expand visitor/pay parking. I also noticed they paved the F lot near the stadium. Oh we're sorry we cut one of your lots in half but hey we paved that other lot that's twice as far so you can use that! At this point I wouldn't put it past them to change that lot to SB. 

So yeah, if you haven't seen or heard yet, now you can know what to expect if you're an off campus student when you come to get books before classes start 














 Can anyone point me to a place where I can get replacement parts for a Galaxy Nexus? 

What are frequently broken internal parts on the Galaxy Nexus that I can also buy in advance before they break and before it's too late to get replacement parts, if it already isn't too late now? The wife and i both have the phone and due to money and not wanting to lose unlimited data, neither of us will be getting any new phones anytime soon so I need to make these last as long as possible. 




 Sometimes I just don't have any money to do anything with at a certain point in the game so all I can do is wait for midnight to come around before I can get some more to do something with, and the fast time speed just doesn't feel fast enough, and I'm not talking about the performance issues, because those make it even worse. 




 So I've been somewhat out of the loop in anime for a while, especially since it seems that anything that gets dubbed doesn't catch my interest anymore, so here I am, for the first time, humbly delving into the realm of subbed anime.

The wife and I are huge FMA fans so we've seen Brotherhood already, and more recently we got into Shingeki no Kyojin/Attack On Titan and Free!

If you don't mind, please write a short synopsis of what the anime is all about and why you recommend it

I didn't see a rule against recommendation threads so sorry if this is looked down on, but waiting a week for every Attack on Titan episode is killer and it leaves me wanting to watch copious amounts of anime 





























 I'm just wondering what others' opinions are on thus. I've only ever seem the one in Butte and the one put on by Harvest in Billings and the Butte experience is far superior since you can light off your own fireworks without getting fined so the whole night is a big firework show in addition to the big show at sundown. 

I was finally able to make it to the Butte one after wanting to go for years but always working and it was awesome. It was also fun driving around town blasting Eye of the Tiger waving the American flag out the window. I have to work in the morning but it is worth it

 The wife and I are going to be attending a wedding in Missoula this weekend but we are also short on money to be able to stay at a hotel or anything so instead we are going to make a camping trip out of it. I'm not too familiar with the area around Missoula but are there decent camping areas next to a river/creek where we can pretty much just stop and set up a tent for a couple nights? We also don't want to be too far away from the city just so we're not spending more on gas 









 This probably isn't very revengey but it certainly is the most petty thing I've done in recent times.

At my job, a restaurant, our daily duties are outlined in a list. So in the morning we come in and go about our business and get things ready for working and then we get our lists and unless the managers decide to send someone home early, we're responsible for completing the list in its entirety, hopefully within 8 hours, and if the estimated time for the list is longer than 8 hours, certainly no longer than that allotted time. The list is generated by a computer and sometimes modified by the manager and it is determined by how much product we have on hand currently, and what we are projected to use that day/the next day.

On this particular day, I had probably a 10 hour list, and it was probably a Friday or a Saturday so product that we were low or out of had to be done quickly so we didn't run out. One of the things I had to do required sliced potatoes, and the amount I had to do required 50 pounds of it. No big deal, because as soon as I wash the potatoes, all I have to do is put it in a modular food processor that has a slicing attachment and 50 pounds of potatoes is sliced within a couple minutes. Except someone broke that attachment, and management didn't seem to care enough to tell me that it was broken. Had I known, I would have started on what I was working on sooner, but instead I did some other things that I knew needed to be done and the potatoes wouldn't be a big deal. 

You can imagine I wasn't very happy when I found out the part was broken because by this time we were almost out of what I needed it for, so now something that would take 5 minutes turned into an extra hour of work. I essentially had to stop everything else I was doing and focus on slicing the potatoes by hand. Slicing the potatoes themselves didn't take a whole hour, but that time I spent slicing potatoes between running things to the line and to the expo alley could have been spent doing other things if the part wasn't broken. I even asked the manager there at the time if there was anyone in another area that they could spare for about 15 minutes to help me slice the potatoes so I can get some other stuff done, and they said they would get some help for me, but that help never came.

And this is where the pettiness comes into play. On our list there is the printed estimated time to complete the list, and below that is a line reserved for the computer or manager to add additional time and then explain what the extra time is to be used for. Then there is a line below that to combine them for the total amount of time. I wrote an extra hour in myself and then in the comments wrote "slicing 50 pounds of potatoes by hand"

tl;dr: slicing potatoes by hand is for chumps like me 














 I recently got one as a gift and my last apple product was a 5th gen iPod that just sits in my car nowadays. I've mostly been into android devices so I'm not familiar with the relative apps in the iOS ecosystem. I've always heard good things about alien blue but I don't really want to pay for a reddit app.

For the most part I like it so far but I'm unsure of what exactly to do with it beyond replacing my phone as something to mess around with while on the couch watching tv. 




 My family has had lots of dogs and when I moved out and got married we got a dog ourselves about 5 years ago, but none of the dogs I've ever owned were this high energy and stubborn. We recently went to the animal shelter and we just had to have this little boy. They said he's between 5 and 8 months. People tell us it looks like he's a mix breed but I'm not sure what else he's mixed with.

I know that their energy level means lots of walks/running/playing outside as well as a bigger appetite. The shelter gave us a small bag of Science Diet for his food but once that's up we're switching him to Canadae.

Also, any tips to keep him from eating our other animal's food? Including our new puppy, we have two dogs and a cat. We have our cat's food on top of a container so our smaller dog can't get to it because she made a habit of trying to starve him to death. Our new dog wants to eat both the cat food and our other dog's food. We don't free-feed our animals, they get their daily portions in the morning, but they don't eat it all at once. 

[Here's a picture of the little guy](http://i.imgur.com/2kUzbzw.jpg) 




 I've never done it but I'm considering it since I always hear that it's healthier for the dog and even cheaper than eating kibble

 I just tried using a looping rollercoaster and the coaster just flies backward through the station after the loop and crashes. Am I doing something wrong? 









 First off, forgive me for any dumb autocorrect typos as I'm on my phone, I don't have access to a computer right now. 

My wife had her appointment on Monday with her mom there with her while I was at work. At that point she had the worst panic attack yet, complete with screaming and twisting and contorting her arms. They ended up sending her to the emergency room where they gave her something stronger than clonazepam to calm her down.

At that point I got called while at work and left work to drive 2 hours to where she was. She was calm when I got there because of the meds and I had some alone time with her to talk and she told me that she NEEDS to go somewhere where it's quiet and she needs to stay there for more than just a day and she needs to be monitored while on new meds. Her family wanted her to discharge herself against medical advice in order for me to take her 4 hours to the city we grew up in so she could go to an emergency room there and get admitted to that psychiatric facility.

Her family was convinced that if she stayed and had the crisis response team evaluate her, they would force her into a facility she didn't want to go to, and more specifically, one her cousin went to that didn't work for him. They thought the staff was lying to us but since they have no control over what can be done, I made the decision to stay so we could avoid needing to wait for more blood work and waiting another 3 hours for the crisis response team in that area.

So they came and said she could stay in a facility, and got paperwork together and faxed it to the other hospital and got us set up so we could go there. I drove her the 4 hours and we were both tired and worn out but she stayed up to talk to me and kept me awake since I had about 10 hours of sleep the last few days.

My parents met us at the hospital but it would have been too many people in the room so they had to wait outside and my wife had to sit and answer more questions and by this time that medicine had worn off so her arms were wretching again and her heart rate was high but after a bit she calmed down without needing any meds because she knew she was near the end of the journey and she would get to rest somewhere peaceful and quiet so she could heal. We still had to wait because the damn laptops the nurse was using to record her answers to questions kept freezing so she would leave and we would have to wait for her to come back with another. My wife commented "all this waiting is enough to drive a crazy person sane." After they told us that they were done and soon security would come and escort her to the psych building we could have my family come in and talk for a bit and say goodbye before she had to go. The entire process was about 15 hours including the 4 hour drive between hospitals. I really hope we dont have to go through this process again. Needing to go to the emergency broom in order to get admitted to an inpatient facility is really stupid and expensive. I understand the need to have an evaluation process but can't it be sans emergency room?

She wasn't allowed any electronics so I can only call her through the hospital to talk to her but that would be awkward for her because there are no chairs near any phones and she probably can't talk long before some activity or therapy. There are two different visiting hours that I can visit her at for an hour each, which I've done every time.

She has had a lot of support, I've been there every time, her aunt and cousins have been there a couple and so have my parents. I feel bad that none of the other people in there ever get visitors. She first started some new medication the first day but I forgot what it was. She brought up to the doctor that celexa worked for her mom and they are the same blood type so they gave that a shot and will monitor her to see if that is working. She has the clonazepam which is as needed for anxiety attacks. They also have something to prevent nightmares as well as an optional sleeping pill. I'm not super comfortable with that amount of medication because each one has their own side effects and I feel like this might turn into a game of prescribing pills to treat the side effects and then prescribing pills to treat the side effects of the pills that are treating the side effects. And now I feel like I will have to get a safe for the medication to lock it up in case she gets an urge to pop them all at once.

But ever since being in there she hasn't had any dark shadow thoughts when trying to fall asleep and there aren't any nightmares as well. Over the last few days she has definitely gotten a lot more positive and it feels like this was the best decision. I'm just afraid they will kick her out too soon and then she will regress again and we will have to go through all this over again and it's getting really hard to miss work. I've already missed 3 full weeks and I already have to miss another in May because I'm going with her mom to get surgery done out of state. It was going to be my wife but she is in no condition to get on a plane, especially with that phobia.

Today was a little rough, she had a bad headache that was due to stress in her neck which I believe to be from her slouching a lot. The pain wrapped around her forehead and her depression amplified the effects of the headache and it made her extremely dizzy and weak. Walking was difficult for her and she couldn't concentrate or talk much. I bought a journal and we've been passing it back and forth between visits and writing things in it but she was unable to focus enough to write anything for me today.

She was a lot better during the second visit. A lot more talkative and she was smiling again. Still had some effects of the headache but overall better than this morning and far better than before she got in here. Before today it was looking like she might be discharged Friday but I'm not sure now. I suppose I'll wait and see how tomorrow goes.

Thanks to everyone for all the kind words in the last post. I'm sorry I wasn't able to reply to everyone. Writing everything and putting it out there is therapeutic for me. 




 *edit* I apologize for the huge wall of text. The first paragraph alone is a whole post in of itself when expanded. I already posted about it under a throwaway, and if you really want to read it, here is the link:
http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1atq9f/my_wife_cheated_on_me_last_week_and_then/

To make a long back story short, she started going to a doctor to get something for anxiety of flying because she was going on a trip to London. The doctor also diagnosed her with depression and prescribed her fluoxetine, so she started taking that about 2-3 weeks before her trip. She thought that our marriage was failing and that there was nothing that could be done to save it so she ended up cheating on me with someone else who went on the trip with her (it was basically one of those classes in college where you go somewhere for a couple weeks and write a couple papers on your experience and get credits). She had slowly been falling in love with him over the last year or so. When he was with her on the trip, he used her only to end his dry spell and broke her heart. When she came back, she was more broken than I've ever seen her. 2 days after she got back, she told me what had happened. My heart was broken, but she is the most important person to me in this entire world, so I vowed to her that I will right my wrongs, and I won't let this ruin our relationship. On top of all of this, she had been suffering through school for the last couple years, she didn't want to keep going and wanted to take a break but she felt that her family was pressuring her to finish as fast as she could so she has been overworking herself for the last 4 years. The trip was the final straw.

Fast forward a couple more days, I found her trying to dig into her wrists with a pair of scissors, and not just cutting across the wrists, she was trying to follow her veins "to see if she could even feel it". To this day she still doesn't remember doing that. She said when she looked at the mirror, and then saw the scissors sitting there, something else took over that wasn't her, and next thing she remembered is seeing me coming up the stairs and having scissors in her hand. Luckily the scissors were dull so she didn't even break the skin. She had a counseling appointment that day, and the counselor felt that she needed to stay at a facility for a bit. She thought it might be beneficial too so she went. I brought her things like pencils, her sketchbook, and some painting supplies because that stuff has always been therapeutic for her.

The facility discharged her a day later. The head psychiatrist had a one-on-one with her and told her that she felt she wasn't afraid for her life and that she believes what happened was only an impulse and that she wasn't truly suicidal. After I picked her up, I took about 2 weeks off of work. She told me about the place. They didn't really help her. Every time she sat down and was about to paint, they would pry her away from it to do group therapy sessions, in which she would listen to other people's problems, and then when it got to her and she explained what was going on, nobody had any type of advice for her at all and they moved onto the next person. Over the night she was kept up by someone screaming. When she finally did sleep, she was awoken early by an angry person yelling in the kitchen. It wasn't a very good experience for her.

I spent the two weeks with her and her counselor determined that she was only living her life for me, but not for herself, so all she needed to work on was loving herself again. I spent every second of every day with her, through ups and downs and I took care of her. But after that 2 weeks I had to go back to work. I was more confident in leaving her alone at that time because of the healing we had done, both individually, and as a couple. That week I had 2 days off immediately after the first day of work. My wife was at home, safe, when I got off work. She said she distracted herself all day, which is good, but also not good because I don't really feel good leaving her alone when she has to distract herself to keep herself from thinking suicidal thoughts. At this point, none of our family knows anything about what happened yet. The next day she spiraled down hard. She was talking about the suicidal thoughts and saying how she's trapped and can't get out and there's only one way, and then she had an anxiety attack, so I gave her some more of her anxiety medicine (clonazepam) and it took a really long time for her to calm down. Baths were always relaxing for her, so I got the bath ready and she sat in the hot water with me by her side. Then she put her face into the water and held it there as long as she could and expelled the air from her lungs and I had to yank her out of the water. She apologized profusely and said she didn't know what she was doing. I helped her dry herself and get dressed and we went back downstairs where she slept on the couch for at least 2 hours.

This is where I cracked. I've never had a panic/anxiety attack, and it caused me to make some bad mistakes because of a lapse of judgement. As soon as she woke up my breathing went into a frenzy. I tried calming it by taking deep breaths but it didn't work, it kept getting worse and worse and I was taking deep breaths and I was crying and I couldn't stop. I scared my wife, even though she had panic attacks herself, she hadn't dealt with anyone else having one. I've never seen her look so scared before. She didn't know what to do. She gave me one of her anxiety pills but even then it took me a long time to come down. She paced back and forth not knowing what else she could do. She sat down on the couch and cowered in the corner. When my attack was over and the medication had dulled me a bit, she took me for a drive through town like I did for her, just listening to music and not really driving in any specific direction.

After this is where I made the mistake that I regret the most. When we got home we decided to catch the bus downtown and we could go dancing and drinking. Mixing the alcohol and the medication was something that didn't even cross my mind at all....but I later found out it was on hers the whole time. We drank, and we kept drinking. We had lots of fun. I don't remember portions of that night because I did drink so much. We were able to stumble our way to a friends house where we stayed for the night. The next morning we woke up and began walking the rest of the way home and she was upset...and then she finally said it, the thought that didn't even cross my mind. She said she wanted to go peacefully last night. She hoped that drinking so much alcohol in combination with both of her medications that she would pass on during the night while she slept. Luckily, her depression medication was taken in the morning and the clonazepam was in the early afternoon, and we didn't drink until late at night, so it wasn't as if she downed her meds and immediately started drinking.

After this is where things got real scary for me. Halfway home, she completely forgot what had happened in her life. She suddenly reverted back to being 12 years old. She didn't know who I was, or where we were, and why I was holding her hand. She didn't remember where we lived but she instinctively knew which apartment was ours but didn't recognize it. We were greeted by our dog when I opened the door and she was excited to see a puppy but she didn't really know who the dog was. But she said she had a dream that her grandpa got her a dog around Christmas time and so she named her Noel (and that is actually what happened). After I talked to her for a bit she suddenly became very tired and fell asleep on the couch for at least an hour. When she woke up, she was back to herself but she didn't know how we got home and only remembers walking half of the way. She didn't remember reverting back to being 12 years old.

At this point her mom randomly showed up to run errands in town (she lives in a small town a couple hours away) and wants to have lunch with us, so we eat somewhere and then she dropped us off at the appointment we had for that day with her doctor. Her mom could tell something was up and noted that she seemed down, but she insisted nothing was wrong, and when we got out of the car, I told her that I can't hold my tongue on this situation much longer and that she can't keep avoiding her family. She told me that if I felt I needed to tell her mom then I could do that. We talked to the doctor about the previous couple days and how she spiraled back down as soon as I had to go back to work. He felt that she wasn't safe to herself and needed to go back to the facility. This is when her mom found out because she was our transportation, so when her mom showed up I went and brought her inside and the doctor explained the situation. We took her to the facility, but upon getting there, they said there were no beds left but there were other places that were in the same network in some other cities. Her mother didn't think that bringing her to another facility was a good idea so instead we agreed to let her go home with her mom, where she, her brothers, and her grandmother could keep an eye on her at all hours of the day, whereas I am unable to do so. She can't be left alone for even a minute or else the thoughts could come flooding back.


***My post is getting too long so I'm continuing in a comment***

 I recently got a job and it seems that my most common shift will be 4pm to midnight or 1am. I haven't done night shifts since high school and back then I didn't really have any daily responsibilities. It was just get off school, do homework, go to work, come home, watch a bit of TV, go to bed, and repeat. But now I'm an adult and I've already been conditioned to waking up an hour before I have to go to work in the morning and do all my daily things after work. 

Doing nights now means I can't really do my things after I get off work. Do you come home, shower, and go straight to bed and wake up as early as possible? I seem to have trouble with falling asleep after putting in 8-9 hours at work so I end up staying up really late browsing the net and watching TV and then I sleep until 11am-noon, and after that I only have 4 hours before I have to go to work so I don't do anything because I feel like there isn't enough time to do anything before work as I'm constantly anticipating and watching the clock to make sure I'm not late.

Anyone who has done night shifts for a while or does it for a living have any protips for me? I love this job, but without having something that's mandatory to wake up for in the morning, I'm having a hell of a time trying to manage my time wisely and I feel like it's messing with the amount of energy I have too.

I already took the case apart and reseated the RAM as well as taking the CPU heatsink off, cleaning up the thermal compound and re-applying it. It started up just fine so I shut it off and then put it back together and put it back in its spot and started it again, and then the same boot loop happened

***EDIT:***

So I now am able to get the computer to boot properly. I kinda found the cause, I will have to do a little more testing tomorrow when I have time. Having my external harddrive plugged into the front USB ports was causing the boot loop, even though I have my first SATA port set to be the primary boot device. So now I'm not sure if it's just the USB 3.0 jumper pin area that is bad or shorted or what. But when i plug the drive in after the computer is booted, the drive is detected and works fine.

I haven't checked to see if it will do the same thing to the rear USB3.0 ports or even the 2.0 ports. Or to see if different USB harddrives have the same effect. 




 What do you do with yours? All I have is the paddle, the dough hook, and the whisk, and my paddle is a pain because I'm constantly needing to use my spatula to scrape the sides and that isn't so easy with really thick dough stuffs

Where before it was working just fine in an earlier iteration of the project:

*edit* I fixed the problem, but I'm still wondering why it did that. What I had was an entire PSD project imported into After Effects with all editable layer styles. I don't know why the gaussian blur would do that just because the layer styles were intact. What I had to do was import that layer separately as footage and merge the layer styles and then after that it blurred properly. 


































 What is the best thing that you experience or happened to you this year? 
























 If it is how much more water am I supposed to add compared to what I would add for bleached flour?

I always thought there really wasn't a difference between whole wheat flour and bleached flour 





























 First off I'll mention it is a Verizon Galaxy Nexus. I know there are some LTE radio problems with the Verizon version but after using it for about a week I haven't experienced any of the problems I've read people coming across.


This phone just feels fantastic. I got it used from someone who ended up needing to get an iPhone for work because it was all Apple integrated stuff. Phone is practically brand new, with an Incipio case and the extended battery. 

But now I'm wondering, what reasons could I possibly have to switch to a custom ROM like let's say CM10? What are the benefits of using CM10 over the version of JellyBean I have on the phone? Or any other ROM for that matter?

I am going to root it just because it's a useful thing to have be done, but I just don't know what improvements a custom ROM will have. 




 About 2 years ago my monitor started acting up and then it finally just stopped working entirely. I read that it was common for the problem to be blown capacitors and it was an easy fix, so I opened it up and took everything apart, found some bulging capacitors and took a note of the specifications of each one. Then I went to mouser.com and ordered replacement capacitors. The replacement parts arrived but then I delayed fixing it because I didn't have a soldering iron at the time. I kept delaying it every time I had free time to get a soldering iron I'd be like meh I'll do it later. A year or so went by and I still hadn't fixed it. The stand was still sitting on my desk, the board was still on my desk, and the rest of the monitor sat on my floor. 

I then finally went and got a soldering iron from Radio Shack as well as some solder, and then again I put it off day after day, week after week, month after month. Finally yesterday while cleaning up the room I decided TODAY is the day. I got out my replacement parts, opened up my soldering iron and I went to down. All in about a half hour I had completely replaced all the bad capacitors and was ready to plug everything in and see if it worked, and it did! It worked perfectly as if it were brand new. So I put everything back together and the part that surprised me is that I remembered where each and every screw went. I was afraid I would have forgotten after 2 years of having it completely dismantled.

So here I am, with my old 2nd monitor again, satisfied with life. Here's a small album of pictures

So, Reddit, what are you proud of that you fixed instead of replaced? 




 I see more than one thing wrong here:

Firstly, he's interfering with someone's class, which he shouldn't be doing.

Secondly, he's making assumptions. Somehow he was under the impression that the students were not prepared to put the play on, and yet he had no proof of this. He has no idea how much work had been put into the play. It had been in planning since about the second week of school. If he thought they weren't prepared, he shouldn't have waited until the night everything was supposed to go down to cancel it.

His personal feelings is that the play would reflect poorly on the English department, but in reality, him being a class A jerk is what will reflect poorly on not only his department, but him too. This is not how a department should be run, everyone in the play was genuinely excited for tonight, and to step on that is just wrong down to the very core. I'm involved in the play in two ways. I know people actually in the play and they are extremely upset about it being cancelled because Gaines has no idea how much work was actually put into the play. The second thing is my boss's company is one of the sponsors for the play. It was just a little thing but to have his gesture of goodwill be for nothing is a direct slap in the face by Dr. Gaines.

I'm currently drafting a letter which I will send to him, the dean of the College of Letters and Science, and President Cruzado. Even if you hadn't heard of the play, or you did and weren't planning on attending, please contact these three people and tell them how you feel about this situation. Dr. Gaines needs to know what he did was wrong and he should be made to retract his decision and allow the play to happen.

* [Dr. Philip Gaines' contact info](http://www1.english.montana.edu/faculty/gaines-philip.html)
* [Dean of College of Letters and Science, Paula Lutz. Her info is in the bottom left of the page](http://www.montana.edu/lettersandscience/)
* [President Cruzado](http://www.montana.edu/president/)

Please spread the word about this. The university we attend should ***not*** act this way. 




 I really wish I could go over but I absolutely cannot right now so are there some ways I can cut some corners while keeping the 250gb SSD? Was hoping to upgrade my PC I bought last year with the bigger SSD and putting the old 128 in the new PC.

A couple quick notes because for some reason some items aren't listed at some merchants:

* The Corsair PSU is 47.99 at Amazon

* The SilverStone case is $95 at Amazon

For some reason the Reddit Markup doesn't show the base price before mail in rebates which is $869.92. Adding in the instant discounts, it's $848.33. Adjusting the price for the items I'm getting off of Amazon (the PSU and case) the price is 814.77. I need to get just below $780. All items have to have free shipping, amazon prime, or shoprunner qualifications so that I don't have to spend money on shipping. Everything on Amazon is free 2 day on my list and everything on Newegg in the cart so far is shoprunner. 

Basically all I need to do is shave $40 off the build. What can I do to accomplish that? I can't change the case, it needs to be that one to work. Should I just buy most of it and wait to get some other items? I can temporarily put a stick of ram in my current PC into the new one but cutting out the RAM only brings the price down by $25.

Just a quick note: the first build includes the PVR, the second doesn't have it added in.


Basically for this computer, I want to use it as my HTPC but I also want it to be able to play games. Nothing super fancy at ultra graphics and super resolutions, just basically be capable of playing most modern games at a decent framerate 




 I'm not very familiar with mid-range products and what is better than what, especially when it comes to new mid-range stuff versus old top of the line parts.

The $800 has to include an SSD and a PVR, I was most likely going to go with the Happauge PVR2 Gaming Edition since it has HDMI inputs and I'd rather deal with HDMI than with Component. Does anyone have experience with dealing with PVRs? Can I just split the output from my AV Receiver and send one line to the TV and one to the PVR so I don't have to individually connect my PS3 and 360 to the PVR whenever I want to use it?

Ideally I'd like the computer to be small so it's semi-portable and sit horizontally. I'm thinking maybe a Micro ATX motherboard with a case that can fit at least 2 standard harddrives and an SSD. 









 I was downloading and at first it got stuck on "starting repair" but didn't do anything. It threw the download back up into the active downloads but it wasn't going anywhere. So I paused it and other stuff started to download like normal, but this particular download is still on top of the downloaded saying "starting repair." I'm on a slower PC and needless to say par2.exe and sab were taking up quite a bit of resources because of this. So I ended up having to kill the processes. After I restarted sab it began to verify the files and got to 34/34 and then said repair failed not enough blocks. Other items are continuing to download but this still remains on the top taking up resources. I can't remove the nzb at all, it just stays there.

This is what I see:

 It was a great place to post those catch-all type posts that don't specifically belong in a subreddit. I mean Reddit started out with no subreddits, but then after a while they got rid of the main reddit, why do such a thing? 




 My secondary job is that one to two nights a week I sit on a bus at night to basically make sure drunk people don't cause problems. It's mostly funded through the university here and is meant to reduce drunk driving. It earned the name "The Drunk Bus" but for some reason the student organization at the university thinks that's below them and wants that negative connotation gone, even though that is 100% the purpose of this bus. So we've taken it upon ourselves to turn it into the party bus!

When the bars close at 2am, we get a pile of drunk people on the bus, so I'm putting music onto my old Zune that would be appropriate for a bus full of drunk people to play over the speakers. What are must haves?

So far my list:

* most stuff by Journey

* most stuff by Queen

* The Final Countdown

* Wagon Wheel by Old Crow Medicine Show

* popular Lonely Island songs

* Party Rock Anthem

 It seems like I can never make a craft that has enough lift to actually take off before the end of the runway, and then 90% of the time I catch something after I go off that ledge and blow an engine off or something.

And then by the time I actually do get into the air with something, I don't feel like there are proper wing physics. I end up going into an unstoppable lengthwise spin and crash into the ocean

I just don't know what to do to keep the plane steady in the air, any help? 









 A business on 19th was broken into and I think was set on fire. There were firetrucks there all night tonight. On top of that Journey Church was also set on fire and it looks like the whole building is burnt to a crisp. 

I was listening to the police scanner while riding the bus (it's my job) and they increased patrols tonight, especially near businesses. Thry were looking for someone or a group all night using spotlights and flashlights to either find them or deter them from breaking into more businesses. 





























 For me it would have to be custom rules for word prediction/autocorrect in swiftkey. I love this keyboard to death but there are a few quirks that annoy the tar out of me. When I type just "i" I would like it to autocorrect to I every single time... Sometimes it doesn't. It would also help with contractions. I sometimes type "I'm" or "I'd" or "I'll"  yet when I type "im", "Im", "id", "Id", "ill", or "Ill", the contractions are nowhere to be seen. When I just type "I" I am only given one of the contractions to choose from and sometimes none. It would be a thousand times easier for me to type if I can make custom rules because despite the pattern learning it doesn't seem to get what I want to type. 

What are your must have features for your favorite apps? 



















 I am so sick of bicyclists being all over the road riding at like 15mph, making illegal turns and lane changes, running stop signs and ignoring traffic lights. The wife and I almost got T-Boned in our brand new truck because a bicyclist felt that stop signs didn't apply to him. 

If there is one thing I love about winter here it's that it keeps 95% of these dumbasses off the road. 




 I got two, one I intended to replace using a full PC for my media center and instead reduce it to NAS status. How does using XBMC on a Raspberry Pi compare to anything else? 




 I have a couple of games I want to play but I don't want to pay $5 for the app if I am certain game won't work on my phone or tablet. 




 I was thinking it would be cool to get a group of us together and hike up one of the couple hundred day-hike trails in the area and have a picnic/fish. Post if you're interested and we can try to get something together within the next couple of weeks! 









 Stay safe out there guys and make sure to completely put your fires out when you are camping, we don't need anymore people being evacuated from their homes. 




 A place my wife + friends really want to rent is through them and I'm wanting to know if people have had good or neutral experiences with them. I looked for reviews online and all of them were bad but it seems like most of the problems could have been avoided by documenting the place better when they moved in. But it is also my understanding that it is far more common for people to make the effort to post negative reviews than positive ones. Pretty much all the rental companies in bozeman have exclusively negative reviews online. 


































 I find myself always annoyed by rain. It seems to happen too often and for too long. Almost every time I come up from my mines it's raining. Every time I start a new project or building, it's raining. Whenever I die far away from spawn or my bed, it's dark and raining. So if you were given a way to end it all, would you take it? No I'm not offering something in the way of a mod, I always play online so a mod wouldn't do much good except for optifine where I can turn visually seeing the rain off. I'm just wondering if there are many people out there like me.

*edit* Yes I know there are single player commands and yes I know toomanyitems and notenoughitems have an option to turn off rain, and yes I know you can disable the particles with optifine. I'm not talking about a 3rd party solution, I'm talking first party solution, as in, vanilla minecraft has an option to disable rain like they do for clouds. 









 The *only* semi-viable alternative to Verizon here is ATT and that's only because they just own Alltell's old towers now. Verizon still has the best signal in the area, and besides, there's no hope for me to get unlimited by switching to ATT.

So does anyone have any advice for what I can do? The big problem for me is that my upgrade is a year out, so I can't use any upgrade pricing to get a 4g phone. And on top of that, we don't even have 4G/LTE in our area yet. Last I heard we would have it late this year or early next year but I'm afraid that if I buy a 4g phone in order to keep my unlimited, not only will I be eating the cost of buying a phone at retail pricing, but I'll also be paying an extra $10/mo for service I don't even have.

What do, Android?  




 Or should I say I have none. Not 100% sure what to do in this situation.

It was an illegal left turn, I turned left onto a street with 2 lanes on each side and went to the far lane instead of the closest lane. It was my first traffic ticket and I got it deferred over 2 years ago. 




 I always seem to catch them too late when there's already several hundred or thousand comments so my question just gets buried in the abyss. 









 The other day I opened my mailbox to find what could either be a child support billing statement, invoice, or receipt. It was meant for my neighbor. Luckily we have clips on our doors at our apartment complex so I didn't have to have to awkwardly give it to them in person, I just clipped it to their door and went along my way. 









 I can't find if there are any restrictions on this or if there are exceptions for the restrictions. I might be getting a place where there will be 4 of us, but in a year my brother is going to be graduating high school and moving up here for college and will be wanting to live with me and not on campus. Is it possible to have 5 tenants in a home? 




 Am I the only one who finds this hilarious? 









 Just beat City yesterday. Seriously these the most well done superhero games I've ever played. Obviously this couldn't have been a Batman game without Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill playing as Batman and The Joker. Both games are really great at showing off how dark the Batman universe can be while still being the typical campy Batman we all know. They went to lengths to really make sure Batman doesn't kill anyone. When you do a ledge takedown you think he's just gonna toss them over the edge but he manages to tie them to the ledge and they just hang there. And when you knock people out, in Detective Mode they are shown as unconscious. And then obviously you have everything bat related, the batarang, when he sprays explosive gel he does it in the shape of a bat, his computer is called the Batcomputer.

What I was really impressed with is your encounter with multiple of the big bad guys in the Batman universe. You're trapped in Arkham Asylum or Arkham City with just about every bad guy and his henchmen who want Batman dead. It's like the equivalent of throwing a normal person into a pit of rabid wolves. And in usual Batman fashion, not a single fuck is given and he defeats everyone. Along the way your suit gets torn up to reflect how much shit he has been through in a single night.

If you like Batman even the slightest, and maybe if you don't like Batman so much, you should give this game a go if you haven't already, it's well worth the time. I did everything possible in Arkham Asylum except the challenge mode, and I'm working on doing all the side stuff in City now. 









 I'm looking for a second job but I'd like to be doing something where I'm doing some sort of physical activity and not a job where I'm standing/sitting most of the day. Full time is also a bonus 




 I've been noticing my internet on my phone being exceptionally slow lately so I did a few speed tests today and yesterday. So far the best download I got was around 400kbps, and my upload constantly hovers around 600kbps. Is anyone else experiencing these horrible speeds?
