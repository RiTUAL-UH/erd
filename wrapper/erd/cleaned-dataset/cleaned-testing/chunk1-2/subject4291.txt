 I grew up bilingual. So grateful. Definitely gonna raise any kids I may have speaking 2 or more languages. 
























 I definitely prefer Chii's rendition. In general I don't like a lot of KPP's music, save for a few songs. "Fun" is a good word to describe her music in general, in my opinion.  




 You've given us quite the taxing challenge. How about "Washing"? Could you afford us more characters? This really constitutes a problem...

Sorry I don't have anything better :(  




 I just found this. imo she sounds amazing!

Any redditors want to aid me in supporting her dream?! 




 Is it better to play someone old, that you've played many times and has had quite an impact on your life, or to play something you haven't played, but you know the franchise, the mechanics, the rough story line etc? Is the (relativity small) novel experience more valuable than the nostalgic experience? 




 I feel like I should know this, but what's that from?

 Man, what kind of birthday songs are your friends and family into? That sounds messed up. 




 They will look up and ask "Tell us about Bryson" and I will whisper "no".
 




 This had bugged me for some time, being a Belgian studying in America. I grew up speaking Dutch and French, so whenever an American pronounces a typical Dutch/French word incorrectly, it gets under my skin. 
One recent example is my professors pronunciation of 'apartheid'. In Afrikaans or Dutch it should be pronounced something like 'apart hide', but my profs use the American 'th' pronunciation in the word.

Am I in the wrong here? If no, what are foreign words that get mispronounced that really bug you? 









 Tough project. You may want to start with a clean slate. 





























 Ouch. Maybe you'll find some middle ground that works for both of you? 




 Oh dang. Good to know. Thanks for the replies, it's been very enlightening (since I was considering JET myself).  




 Is that amount of money a living wage in Japan? And I'm assuming you enjoy your job/stay in Japan? 




 Ouch, sorry to hear about that. 




 If/when you do take her out, does she liven up after a while? Perhaps it'll just take some time for her to adjust to being more social.  




 How'd she become an ex, if you don't mind my asking? 




 English as a Foreign Language, iirc 




 What's it like? Are you on JET? If so, would you say it's worth it?

 I was lost while trying to get to a late evening meeting in Melbourne (I was an exchange student). My phone's GPS didn't work abroad, and I didn't have the sense to print a map before leaving. I had no idea where I was or which direction to go in, so I ask a random person on the street for directions. He says I'm about five miles from where I need to be, and there aren't tram that could take me there. He offers me a ride, which despite being super weird, I accept. I would have been late otherwise. 

In his car we got a bit conversation going. I asked him what he does. He was the [mayor of Yarra City](http://www.yarracity.vic.gov.au/Your-Council/Councillors/cr-geoff-barbour-mayor/). I was dumbfounded. Awesome guy. He was up for re-election, so I made sure to tell my Aussie pals about this encounter (some of whom called bullshit).

tldr; lost in Melbourne City, got ride from random stranger who turned out to be the mayor. 




 Sheeple. 




 I owe it to him to never stop searching. But what if he didn't actually throw the ball? 




 I agree with this. There's too much government secrecy as is. That said, the issue of politicians blindly voting along party lines is still one that needs to be addressed, as well as the issue of politicians not understanding what they're voting for (my favorite example is [this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/08/florida-banned-computers_n_3561701.html)). 




 This way, uninformed politicians would be kept out of blindly voting along party lines. As an added bonus, you'd be able to see which politicians are roadkill (i.e. not reading anything, thereby not voting on anything).

The quiz would likely need to be created by professional lawpersons, and would need to be kept in strict secrecy for this to work. 
 




 Belgium here. If you see someone you don't usually see (i.e. someone not from work/school/etc) three times in a day, you must go drinking with them that evening. 




 That pun makes me so angry I might flip a bit.
