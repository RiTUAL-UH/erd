 Mutant-like superfast wireless connectivity in Australias European-styled city of Melbourne 
























 Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds could be used to construct vital components for quantum computers. But hitherto it has been impossible to read optically written information from such systems electronically. Using a graphene layer, a team of scientists headed by Professor Alexander Holleitner of the Technische Universitt Mnchen (TUM) has now implemented just such a read unit. 



















 These materials are predicted to show a phenomenon called the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, and belong to a class of materials known as transition metal dichalcogenides, with layers a few atoms thick. QSH materials have the unusual property of being electrical insulators in the bulk of the material, yet highly conductive on their edges. This could potentially make them a suitable material for new kinds of quantum electronic devices. 









 Commonwealth Bank of Australia will get early access to developments made in this highly technical field, quantum computing. The centre for quantum computation and communication technology at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) aims to make the manufacture of quantum computers increasingly viable by 2018. 





























 We can continue this development towards 2017, we will put ourselves in a great position to challenge for the 2017 World Cup title 












































 The list details 400 cities, suburbs and towns across Australia where homes and businesses will be connected to the network by June 2016 - or 100,000 connections per month. 



























































 Just 18 months after launch, Synbiota Incs global network of biohackers has produced successful Synthetic Biology startups. 









 Philip Nelson, EPSRC chief executive, adds that the hubs "will draw together scientists, engineers and technologists from across the UK, who will explore how we can exploit the intriguing properties of the quantum realm". He adds that "The area offers great promise, and the hubs will keep the UK at the leading edge of this exciting field." 









 Physicist Claes-Gran Granqvist of Uppsala University in Sweden says that Fan's team has demonstrated an "interesting effect".

 Researchers in India have carried out a data mining exercise to determine which are the most important risk factors in increasing the chances of an individual suffering a heart attack. Writing in the International Journal of  Biomedical  Engineering and Technology, they confirm that the usual suspects high blood cholesterol, intake of alcohol and passive smoking play the most crucial role in severe, moderate and mild cardiac risks, respectively. 









 Australian researchers have found that the majority of weight lost when we do manage to shed the kilos is actually breathed out as carbon dioxide. 














 Mice and humans share about 95 percent of their genes, and mice are recognized around the world as the leading experimental model for studying human biology and disease. 









 The term network monitoring can be defined by a system that ceaselessly monitors a network of computers for bad or slow constituents and informs network administrators about the situation via email or any other notifying system. It is an integral part of network management. 









 In the journal Optica this week, a team of scientists from the Netherlands proposes a security system for credit cards and passports that would leverage the power of quantum physics. 









 Curiosity rover exploring Mars demonstrate that not only is methane present on Mars, but the planet may also be periodically belching it out.  














 In the same way as we now connect computers in networks through optical signals, it could also be possible to Opens The Way to Future Quantum Internet 









 Scientists have created a device that can release a single, precisely shaped photon of light, opening the way to a secure quantum internet that is incredibly powerful and impenetrable to hackers. 






































































































































 Feedback from UAT cycles can be fed into subsequent iterations of development, increasing software robustness and usability. 









 UAT directly involves the intended users of the software. UAT can be implemented by making software available for a free beta trial on the Internet or through an in-house testing team comprised of actual software users.
