 I was baptised a second time (first as baby) last year and this thread is making me really regret it and hold some animosity towards that church that let me go through with it. They knew I was baptized once but insisted on doing it again when I came back to God. 




 I was baptised as a baby in an Anglican church then again last year when I came back to Christ. The church I attended at the time inisted I get re-baptized. I am going through this thread and see a second baptism is unnecessary - what should I do? Was a second baptism a sin or...what?

 Well now that you've met Matlock, swiped his pills....""Take one every hour to prevent spastic heart convulsions." 




 Throne of Thunder is considered a Legacy Raid and uses the old loot system. You can run each boss, regardless of difficulty, once per week for a chance to get a Secret. Once you kill a Throne boss, your chance is used up for that week.

Siege of Orgrimmar uses the new loot system. You can repeatedly kill the first 8 bosses in LFR/normal for 1 secret per boss, for a total of 8 secrets.

Additionally, Lei Shen and Sha of Pride have a 100% drop rate on your first kill.

So if you're really unlucky, you can still get 9 per week. 1 Lei Shen, 8 from Siege of Orgimmar if you grind it out until each boss from Immerseus to Nazgrim drops one.

After that, you need 12 Runestones, which only drop from ToT Wings 3  4 and SoO Wings 1  2. Me and a guildie grinded out the Runestones in a single day, as we were very lucky with the drops from Throne of Thunder. After that you need the Heart of Lei Shen, which you can run Pinnacle of Storms again the same week as Runestones and he will drop it guaranteed.

If you have 0 Secrets, you can earn 9 guaranteed this week if you grind SoO 1/2 and kill Lei Shen. Say you are unlucky again and only earn another 9 next week: you will be unable to get the Cloak. You need to get at least 11 Secrets this week to even have a shot at getting the Cloak.

You have 2.5 weeks, as Warlords launches on a Thursday. Good luck. 




 1. Don't go to Wal-Mart.

2. You can get WoW to run a high-medium for about $500. I would suggest going to /r/buildapc and posting this same thread there. They will pick out the exact parts you need if you can (or know someone who can) build it themselves. This is your best and most cost-effective option.

Alternatively, you can get something from Amazon like [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0089KDCIU/ref=s9_hps_ft_g147_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DERpf_rd_s=center-3pf_rd_r=0YT7SJ0R85ZDVP3ZB0KZpf_rd_t=1401pf_rd_p=1880497982pf_rd_i=1000933821) or [this](http://www.amazon.com/CyberPowerPC-Gamer-Ultra-Gaming-PC/dp/B009RRJ1SE/ref=sr_1_1?s=pcie=UTF8qid=1414593804sr=1-1keywords=gaming+computer) which will run the game quite well.

 I read a while back that the government had this big tax break program for students to get their own laptops or something. Of course most ended up using their computers for free games like LoL, causing a Brazilian [Eternal September.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September)

Most Brazilians don't listen (or understand) to instruction, heed raid warnings or even know how to play their class. [In free games like LoL or Dota 2, they are notoriously worse, as the barrier for entry is access to a computer with Internet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1eluep/brazilians_need_their_own_server/ca1qkmp)

I think it has to do with language and cultural differences. Firstly, they cannot read nor speak English and therefore, are inable to read English class guides, communicate with English-speaking players or learn to play their class effectively. Secondly, South Americans, Brazilians in particular, are extremely proud (some would say arrogant) people - look at the World Cup for proof. If you try to offer criticism and help in a game, you either get Portuguese in return (hue), insulted or ignored.

So you have language barriers + cultural differences (e.g. patriotism/pride) + an Eternal September because of the supposed "free laptops" thing + lag = [a recipe for disaster.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1eluep/brazilians_need_their_own_server/ca1hsmt) 




 I'm going to say $300-400, around the price of the Aquila, maybe a bit more. It's less of a combat-capable ship than the Aquila, but serves in a similar role.

  Says who?

As a Christian, God only knows. I believe Jesus lived the perfect life and Christians should try to follow him, although we will always fail. 




 I don't know if you're being funny or not, but the story was told to a Jewish Pharisee. There are many layers to the parable, but one of the subjects of the story is the "good" son, who envied the prodigal son. Jesus was making the point of not being "holier-than-thou" and instead, act in humility and give thanks that your brother has returned from the depths of sin. 




 I am ilvl 558 and primarily raid Heroic (old normal) while occasionally playing Unholy with the same gear. Should I optimize for a DPS build, or stay survivability?

 What? I am saying that Jesus is uncreated - he was there in the beginning as John writes.

The poll indicates Evangelicals believe Adam + Eve, or whatever, came before Jesus, as if Jesus was created. 




 I am only on the first page but the thing that struck me was most DISAGREE Jesus was the firs thing God created. Have none of these people read John 1:1? 




 I would recommend Goblin for a new starting zone. Blood Elves and Draenei still use their old 1-15 zones from TBC, while the vanilla races use revamped vanilla zones.

  How can I better understand inflation?

The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and, subsequently, purchasing power is falling. 

As inflation rises, every dollar will buy a smaller percentage of a good. For example, if the inflation rate is 2%, then a $1 pack of gum will cost $1.02 in a year.

http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp

In World of Warcraft, currency devaluation happens due to a number of factors: an increase in quest reward gold, lower barriers to entry for new producers/extractors, 6.0 currency conversion and gold buying. 

The biggest contributor is the increase in level cap and subsequently, increase in quest reward gold. In Cataclysm, the average daily quest would grant about 7.5 gold. In Mists of Pandaria, daily quests would grant about 11-25 gold. 

Resources have also become more widely available to farm, specifically Ghost Iron Ore. Previously, we had to level mining to max to farm the highest tier of ore. This is no longer the case, as Ghost Iron Ore is available for mining at mining level 1, making the barrier to market entry much lower. As more people sell and buy the ore, more money is exchanging hands and in turn, re-distributing wealth.

Furthermore, with the low bar to entry comes new ways to earn profit by means of production. If I farm all the materials I need for a Sky Golem, an engineering-produced mount, the materials will likely cost around 10-12,000 gold at average market value. But I farmed those materials myself, therefore the cost is significantly reduced. I then sell that Sky Golem for a whopping 15,000 gold or so. Not only did I make a profit of 3-5,000 gold on baseline market value, but I likely made much more as I produced the materials. Those materials I farmed netted me a healthy profit and introduced more gold into the market.

Additionally, the recent 6.0 patch had converted Valor and Justice Points into gold, which will be used as the go-to currency. The average player received about 1000 gold from this conversion, substantially increasing the amount of gold in the economy.

Then there are "intangibles," or things we have no data on as players - namely gold buying/selling for real world currency. Right now, the average gold buyer sells 10,000 gold for $7-10. Let's assume $1/1000 gold for simplicity's sake. There are two kinds of gold sellers - those who manually earn their gold through farming (be it mobs or materials), or those who sell gold from stolen accounts. The former are doing the same thing our Sky Golem manufacturer does; they are converting raw material into hard currency. While buying gold from these people is still illegal, their method of producing gold is technically not illegal. On the other hand, stolen accounts end up hindering the economy by not introducing new gold; they simply redistribute stagnant wealth.

I hope this helps.

TL;DR Greater quest rewards. Lower market entry for new extractors and producers. Currency conversions. Gold buying. 




 You can run Siege of Orgrimmar normal/heroic/mythic repeatedly until you get a Secret from all 8 bosses that drop one (Immerseus - Nazgrim). Throne of Thunder has 12 bosses that will drop one, but you only get one chance per boss a week due to the different legacy raid loot system it uses.

In theory, you can get 8+12, for 20 Secrets if every Throne of Thunder boss drops one (but that is highly unlikely). Lei Shen and Sha of Pride are guaranteed to drop Secrets, so if you do not have time to run SoO constantly to get 8, you can get at least 2 for sure.

After you finish Secrets, you need to collect the 12 Runestones. You will have 1.5 weeks next Tuesday, as WoD drops on a Thursday the 13th, two days after reset. 

If you finish Secrets this week, you can very easily get Runestones done by running SoO repeatedly for 8+1 (Lei Shen), then again on Tuesday/Wednesday the final week.

 Have you played through the revamped Cataclysm 1-60 leveling? If not, I highly recommend. 




 Free food. Any university student will thank you for it. 




 What else is there? 




  celigaycy

Love it, though no homo. It's less bad for me to have sex than it is for you. 




 My advice: ignore schooling, job obligations (if you have one) and nearby friendships - focus on your girlfriend first, since she is the most important thing in your life as I can tell. Is her timezone ahead or behind you? If ahead, skip school to get extra Skyping time when she is at home. If behind, vice versa. As a mature young adult, this relationship will likely last for many years to come and you should do your best to help foster that growth. School, job...these came come later (night school for example). Don't waste this opportunity for romance that some people never have. 




 The female is scared easily by males approaching out of the blue, without any prior relationship. Don't bother - you will come off creepy and weird, especially when you cannot speak Spanish (I presume). 




 My girlfriend of two years found a box of ~~lewd~~ old videos and photos from ex-girlfriends. All of these are several years old and predate my current girlfriend. She was really upset and wants me to throw all of them away, but they have ~~masturbatory~~ sentimental value to me. Should I get rid of them? It's causing a lot of conflict. Never mind that we're a couple - my happiness is paramount to everything. 




 You do have the right to happiness; that's why I said you should kick her out. She can sell all those "pointless" things that she bought you for Christmas like a Game Boy or TV or whatever to pay for her first month's rent.

 While you could try to keep in contact via Facebook or other social media, the best option would be to move and cut off all contact with them. If they don't want to hang out in person, they won't make the effort to do it online.

If they were your real friends they would stick by you, since they should worry about your happiness - that is the most important thing. 




 She raised you for 20~ years, fed you, bathed you, housed you, free of charge. But now that she is a minor inconvenience to your happiness, that woman has got to go.

You did the right thing by coming here, rather than not discussing this with her or your sister. 




 She is a useless bloodsucker; dump her. 




 You cannot get to Perendi in a Sidewinder - the jump range is too short. 




 Yes. Keep track of what bosses drop secrets, so you know which ones to repeat again. Up to Nazgrim, each has the chance to drop 1 per week, regardless of difficulty. Keep running SoO until all 8 have dropped one. 




 Because in-engine replay systems are very difficult to make, not because developers are lazy. 




 Only the SoO bosses allow you to get repeat kills. ToT is a one-kill-a-week chance, regardless of difficulty. 




 I would like to get a whole branding package if possible. [Here is my current organization](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/orgs/HOLST), but I think it could look a lot better.

What do you guys think? 




 But Marge, that little guy hasn't done anything yet, and you know it's going to be good. 




 I would assume the animations are change server-side to be shown to you as proper third person animations. Think of it like this:

Your friend performs a melee. It looks good to them in first-person, but would look like shit, as seen in the video, in third person. The developer creates another set of third person animations that only other players see when you perform certain actions. When your friend performs a melee, that action is sent to the server client, which feeds it back to you, so you get the proper third person set of animations. 

If you played the game with the proper multiplayer third person animations, in first person, it would probably not play properly, if not look entirely fucked up to begin with (e.g. eyeball height, weapon size, field of view are all different when playing in first person). 




  no marketing building expectations.

What the hell do you call all the trailers and cinematics then? 




 In the same boat, my friend. Depression sucks. 




 The sidebar has our subreddit poll with our favourite books. Every book on there is authentic - not realistic, as we don't have their levels of technology yet - but authentic in that they feel realistic and gritty. For example, District 9 or Battlefield 4 are nowhere near realistic, but they are authentic.

 Sprawl = Vast metropolitan area that stretches along the entire North American East Coast, made up of megacities and (usually in disrepair) geodesic domes that help protect people from pollution.

Ninsei = the downtown of Night City.

 You're trying to find your faith but reject any Christian-based teaching people here try to give you. One of the tenants of Christianity is about humility - it's about admitting your wrong and don't have all the answers. I pray that you will gain at least a piecemeal sliver of Christ's humility. 




  does the bible say this is wrong?

Yes it does, many, many times.

 However we would rather have a "traditional" ceremony and have a house waiting for us.

You don't always get what you want. If you want to get married to her, do it. Have the ceremony later. You sound like a flake to me from your OP. 




 Yeah, compared to other old school MMOs maybe. But look at what people are suggesting - FFXIV and ArcheAge. Are you joking? FFXIV has what...3 raid tiers and about a dozen dungeons? ArcheAge maybe, since its emergent PvP content will provide some hundreds of hours.

But WoW has 16 tiers of raiding AND PvP content + professions + dungeons + questing + achievements + pet battles....I could go on. On my one account alone I have sunk over 2,000 hours. My old account (before it was banned for buying gold) had about the same. Still not bored with the game; I do have the occasional couple months break, but I don't seem to ever quit the game entirely.

 Hey folks, anyone here play WoW? With the new 6.0 patch out, we got lots of new stuff to play around with. I help run a guild that was founded on Christian principles, but is explicitly not a "Christian" guild. If anyone wants to play (I got 9 90s), add me at Toxilium#1491 









 I had a Cutlass before they announced the variants. I was excited to see if they made any changes to my existing ship, so I logged in. To my dismay, my hangar is completely empty, as the only ships I own are the Cutlass and Reclaimer (unavailable in hangar). 





























 Socrates died for this shit 




 nitesmoke deleted his account. the admins have /r/wow now 




 There is no proof he received calls at work. Furthermore, the only thing "doxxed" was his dating profile which NITESMOKE PUT UP HIMSELF. 

He acted in a childish, stupid manner, bullied people, and we all know he called people fags on this very sub. Yet here he is as this social justice champion. Funny how he suddenly becomes a White Knight when he's the one being attacked?

He's a compulsive liar, don't listen to anything he says. 




 He deleted his twitter and reddit account to cover his tracks. 




 You all get Nitesmoke Wolf mounts and the title, Liberator of Gay Rights 




 I would be very wary of anything Nitesmoke is telling us. First, he comes out as some social justice champion for LGBT rights. What? That shit is completely unrelated.

Second, he's changed his story multiple times to cover up his own childish behavior. He couldn't play WoW for a couple days and had a suck attack. That's the whole story. 




 He wants to pass blame for having a completely over-the-top, inappropriate and childish reaction to "Wah, I cannot play WoW."

Instead of owning up to his actions, he jumped on the hot-button issue of today (LGBT rights) and became a SJW in a short paragraph of bullshit.

In the words of a famous Blizzard dev: Fuck that loser.

 Diablo 3 is doing something similar with seasons. You start fresh each season (joining it is optional) and level up a new character from 1, with 0 gold or crafting materials. After about 6-8 months they'll reset and start season 2. 




 My first time tanking was on a bought Prot Warrior account. I paid to change the troll to Draenei male and went into Utgarde Pinnacle completely unprepared. No idea how to hold threat, no idea what any of my skills did. The group disbanded before the first boss.

The account was later banned for being traded lol.

 FYI to anyone considering purchasing the account - Blizzard is VERY on the ball when it comes to account trading. They WILL track your IP address, password changes, etc. to the account and will give a temporary suspension, without warning, if they suspect the account was traded (which is against the ToS). It has happened to me twice and I would be very cautious when trading any Blizzard account.

I have traded accounts like elite dangerous and eve online in the past, but they do not go to the extraordinary lengths Blizzard goes through to stop account trading. You've been warned. 




 890 Jump - because I'm an idiot who likes shiny new things.

Horney Ghost LTI - traded elite dangerous for this bad boy.

AMD Mustang - cheapest ship for around $30 that comes with arena Commander. It also looks cool. 




 What the hell are you talking about? Developers don't give money to publishers. The publisher funds the developer(s) and in turn, reaps the largest reward from sales. 




 Watching any sports, esports or similar event will be like that. I don't watch NHL or NFL but when I go to a live game I get super into the match

 Westboro misread the story where Jesus curses the fig tree for not producing fruit.

GOD

HATES

FIGS 




 I am a Christian and one of the last duties Christ gave was for us to go out into the world, preach the gospel and baptize people in the name of the Son/Father/Holy Ghost.

But the way these street preachers "spread God's Word*" is not the best way to go about doing that imo.

I won't go into it much since this isn't /r/christianity, but basically Christians should follow like Jesus did - he performed miracles, signs and aided people *then* followed up with his message as people inevitably asked questions. Most of the stories or parables in the Gospel are told *after* someone comes up and asks Jesus "Hey, Rabbi, why should I do y or how do I do x?" I never recall Matthew 45:16 "Then the Son of God went out into Los Angeles and held up a sign and preached to all the sinful nerds and they were saved that day."

*Funnily enough, most people think "God's Word" is the Bible. In Islam, God's Word is a physical book (the Quran), while in Christianity, God's Word is Jesus himself. The Bible wasn't even completed and compiled yet when John 1:1 was written...
 




 A surprisingly refreshing, calm, straightforward and down to earth thread on sexuality in /r/christianity. Thanks for sharing with us and as always, you have our prayers.  




 Sold to vistoldak. Quick trade (had to run out for some errands, apologies for the lateness on my part). Enjoy the game! 




 Praise the Lord for their safe return! 









 What's new pussycat? Woahhh woah woah! 




 DIE ROBOTS DIE!!! 




 What is a specter? I own the M50 already so no need for another racer. 




 One problem I had: Where were the 3 new planets getting sunlight? 




 Not that hard of a choice. If you're going to focus on dropping off troops and some combat, Redeemer. For anything else, go with the Carrack. 




 Not as good as Sunshine? Where was the super lame slasher flick at the end of Interstellar? 




 Read The Time Ships if you havent. Fav sci-fi book that is a sequel to HG wells The Time Machine. If you think Interstellars ending was crazy, Time Ships will melt your brain. 




 I think you are being a tad extreme. This is an internet forum where we're all anonymous. I don't equate these discussions to persecution of the early Christians.

I was simply raising the point that this sub seems to downvote unpopular beliefs, despite said beliefs being grounded in scripture. A good sub should upvote any post worthy of proper discussion, regardless of one's opinion or worldview. 




 Didn't you know that in this sub we upvote life-affirming reddit-friendly (i.e. usually liberal) worldviews and downvote anything we disagree with, even if there is scriptural proof to back up said views? 




 A Totally Fun Thing That Bart Will Never Do Again made me shed a tear. 




 You can go to the pledge store and trade me a ship there of equivalent value or a ship in your own hangar or RSI$ credit.

You can chane the name of your Commander in Elite on their website. 




 Crimson Deathcharger on my DK.

 Downvote for bad prices when I can get Reclaimer for 375 and Jump for 635. 




 You are delusional. 




 Releasing on the 13th is a deathwish. 




 No explanation, a "feature" that is integral to the genre itself and that every MMO has. Top voted comment.

Good job /r/mmorpg. 




 Uhh...they were referring to the H1Z1 game. 









 So far the [PC port is looking pretty good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1g2XGnN2jM) and the [first review gave it an 8/10.](http://www.videogamer.com/reviews/call_of_duty_advanced_warfare_review.html)

After Ghosts, I'm happy this is shaping up to be a great CoD.
