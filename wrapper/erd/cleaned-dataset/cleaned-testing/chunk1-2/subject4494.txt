 I know canon was the same, but I think it's too implausible that Quirrell happened to come across V just when Tom was about to come to Hogwarts, with exactly enough time for him to get a job. 




 Why is Voldemort known to be Tom Riddle? There seems to be no good reason for him associating them, so why isn't his Voldemort persona anonymous?   



















 The situation between H and Q looks like classic Parfit's Hitchhiker. They each have no reason to cooperate afterwards, but have reason to believe that they will.

So who thinks this is all a leadup to a discourse on how to solve the problem in full generality? 



















 I see a bunch of tumblr posts (see https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/inappropriate-audition-songs) which follow the format of 

Hi Ill be auditioning for the role of X and Ill be singing Y by Z.

What's going on? 














 1. Hypothesis: "Harry" is a trigger that brings back his memories when said by Quirrell, which is why he never said it before.

2. Snape taught at Hogwarts for 7 years. Harry is 11, and was 1 when his parents died. Snape only came to Hogwarts 3 years after Voldemort disappeared, which is 3 years later than in canon. See http://www.hp-lexicon.org/timelines/timeline_snape.html, which sources this from canon. This is probably significant.

3. I'd like to mention my last theories thread, which didn't get much attention because it was posted right before the new chapter. https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w0xiz/last_crazy_thread_before_it_updates_spoilers_102/

4. I think Snape is being controlled by Quirrell also, as I don't expect Sprout to be powerful enough to have downed him. Remember, everyone found it *plausible* that Snape had actually downed Quirrell in Diagon Alley, so Snape must be pretty powerful. 



















 Here, in no particular order, are all my crazy theories/questions that I wanted to get out before the update, from my notes. Assume spoilers all:

1. Why didn't Lucius know that Harry wasn't getting his mail? He should have at least asked Draco to tell him if Harry got anything or something.
2. There's precedent for Harry's thoughts being hidden; Harry's plan to have Draco rule wasn't mentioned until he said it in the meeting (assuming it was true).
3. Why did H C talk to Zabini and then immediately obliviate him? Seems wasted.
4. Why didn't they try to test Lucius to see if he was telling the truth about the Mark?

His own Death Eaters did not know it until afterward, hence the false Mark I bear; though since I did not truly consent, it does not bind me.

Surely someone had a test that would tell whether the Mark bound him? Since they thought that the Mark sealed the lips of the bearers about itself, why didn't they demand that Lucuis tell them how the Mark worked, and test the response? This seems much simpler than Harry's thing with the actual mark.

* 5. Why is the prank when Harry learns about time-turners in his style? Presumably Harry would still cooperate with the prank regardless of whether it matched his style, so what does that tell us about how Time works?
* 6. Why didn't Lucius know at the trial that Harry could cast a patronus? He gave Draco Veritaserum, right?
* 7. Mcgonagall seems to have a *lot* of killing intent. Why?
* 8. Snape is a Legilimens, which implies he's a perfect Occlumens as well. Why did Voldemort think he could trust the prophecy that he took out of his mind?

I omitted a few that I couldn't figure out they meant. Need to take clearer notes to make time-travel communication easier ... 








































































































 The first time I read through HPMOR (until chapter 101), I really didn't think Quirrell was Voldemort and behind both the Hermione plots. The main reason for that was because Dumbledore had a lot of evidence pointing towards him, and I kept on switching back and forth between thinking Dumbledore did one or both of them to Quirrell or some other perp. (What's mentioned in Harry's conversation with Lucius seems to pin it down, as well as some other things throughout the book.)

Then I saw that [Meta Spoiler](#s "EY had confirmed QQ=V in a retracted Author's note, which confused me. I now think it's almost impossible for that not to be true in at least some sense, or for QQ to not be behind both the duel and troll.")

However, all the evidence that points to Dumbledore is still there, and I don't want to blame *all* of that on Quirrell setting things up.

So my hypothesis is that Q and D are in this together, where "this" is some plan involving getting Harry to fulfill both of their wants.

Evidence in favor of this:

1. Dumbledore accepts Q apparently without needing to know who he is
2. Dumbledore doesn't grow suspicious of Q at any point in the year
3. There are pieces of evidence pointing to both D and Q for the same plots
4. Dumbledore let Harry off too easy for the prison breakout
5. Dumbledore plays along with the plot to get Hermione sent to Azkaban

Pieces of evidence against:

1. Dumbledore lost a lot in the war against V, including his brother (perhaps it's not really him/taken over by Horcrux, or brother's death was staged)
2. Dumbledore appears moral (perhaps he still believes in the greater good/ is trying to achieve immortality despite what he told Harry)

I'm willing to bet for this at 10:90% odds (I'll put up 1 to your 9). Any takers or alternate offers?

Edit: archived at https://archive.today/cZlqY for the bets.

Got this email with the subject line "[ATTENTION SENIORS] If you have $20, this explosive cryptocurrency could change your life"

https://imgur.com/a/F6E7L

So, of course, I immediately clicked on the link, curious which alt coin they were pushing.
The link was to http://pro.wallstreetdaily.com/TAOREWARDSUSPRC/LTAOR209/?h=true, and the long text explanation of what was being sold is at http://pro.wallstreetdaily.com/TAOREWARDSUSPRC/LTAOR209/Full?h=true

Some hilarious excerpts

The value of Bitcoins in circulation has now topped $1.5 billion  more than twice the market cap of Apple.
No wonder major companies like Dell, Amazon, and Target, all accept Bitcoin as payment.

Hahahahahahahaha.

Someone must have done the math too quickly, and thought that Apple's market cap was 700 *million* instead of billion.

And apparently Amazon and Target now accept bitcoins. Wonder if they got that from Gaw? That would also fit with the "get in for under $20" hahahaha.

Before I reveal this opportunity in detail, please allow me to **formerly** introduce myself.

Wait, does that mean you already introduced yourself?

No wonder Americas elite are using it too, including Jerry Seinfeld, Robert DeNiro, and Britney Spears. Its rumored that Denzel Washington used this currency to pay for a $30 million private jet.

Yeah, you can say anything in an article and that will make it have been "rumored". This probably can't be topped.

Even President Obama flashed it to the world while purchasing his lunch.

I take that back.

However, Ive discovered an amazing loophole in Americas rewards-points system.

And you chose to share it with all of us, of course. Wonder what that implies about its viability?

The report reveals the company actively mining Americas top rewards points systems...

Ooh! Mining!

I peg the value of your first opportunity at upwards of $56,700.

... and I'll sell it to you for only $9.99. Aren't I nice?

On page 109 Chris reveals how a morning stop to his local 7-Eleven made him a fortune. Since Chris is an avid Snapple drinker, one day, he noticed the stores shelf spaaaaaace for Snapple products had shrunk from two full refrigerators to less than half of one.
He immediately took action, executing his incredibly simple information arbitrage strategy.
The very next week, Snapple announced that its inventory of unsold products had sharply risen, negatively impacting the companys profits.
Chris tripled his investment in a few days.

... is there anything I could even say to this? My guess is that he is either flat out lying, or invested in hundreds of companies and only reports the profitable ones.

Chris reveals how a friends unassuming Facebook post scored him a quick 50% gainer. The post simply said, Oh my! Chuggington?!!! I think my kids have died and gone to heaven!
Within days of observing the post, Chris perfectly executed his information arbitrage strategy and invested ahead of Chuggington becoming a smash hit among children. 

How can I get him to follow me so I can pump everything I own to this very rich person?

Below are a few of the fantastic letters I received from readers last week...

This is in almost every scam pitch I've ever seen.



Final thoughts: I am really disappointed. If you're going to write a scam pitch, at least make sure all the irrelevant facts in it are true. Also, this is dated from October, so why did I only get an email this week? Someone's slacking off.

(The company referred to is http://investor.points.com/, and obviously Robert Williams owns a large number of shares in it.)

 I know that the code says for coins not to be mined eventually. However, bitcon is likely to be hard forked many times by then, and miners are the ones who decide what happens, so why won't they just decide to continue making coins? They won't have the same commitment to keeping the protocol as us 100 years back, and would do whatever is best for them. Assuming bitcoin is still around then, what factors will affect whether coins stop being mined like scheduled?

The same question goes for every halving. What incentive will miners have to play along? 




 I think we're over due for a crazy theories thread, so here! My own list will hopefully get typed up on the 27th if I get around to it.

 In the conversation Harry had with Mcgonagall in Diagon Alloy, we learn that he isn't superstitious:

Um Harry said. He took a deep breath. Thered been some muggings in our neighborhood, and my mother asked me to return a pan shed borrowed to a neighbor two streets away, and I said I didnt want to because I might get mugged, and she said, Harry, dont say things like that! Like thinking about it would make it happen, so if I didnt talk about it, I would be safe. I tried to explain why I wasnt reassured, and she made me carry over the pan anyway. I was too young to know how statistically unlikely it was for a mugger to target me, but I was old enough to know that not-thinking about something doesnt stop it from happening, so I was really scared.

So it is surprising that on at least two other occasions, in Chapter 21 and 38, he does things which are blatantly superstitious. 

And Harry was sitting in the cavern level of his trunk, slid shut and locked so no one could get in, a blanket pulled over his head, waiting for the week to be over.
10:01.
10:02.
10:03, but just to be sure
10:04 and the first week was done.
Harry breathed a sigh of relief, and gingerly pulled the blanket off of his head.

and:

He didnt sit at the same nearby table hed sat down at with Draco, the first time hed prepared to board this train. That seemed like tempting history to repeat itself.

I'm *very* wary of suggesting this, but as it happened twice, maybe it's significant? Could someone have messed with his mind enough to change how he thought about fate? We know from the first chapter that magic caused Harry to believe that it existed without proper evidence (or at least that's how I read it, as confirming that intuitions exist in HPMOR). But Harry still hadn't updated by the time of the Diagon Alley talk, for some reason. 









 death, taxes, and people who can't count. 









 If partial transfiguration is just "enforcing a relation between separate past and future realities, instead of changing anything over time", then why can't it be used for arbitrary time-travel? Enforce a relationship between the me of "whatever now means" and the me of "now shifted to the past/future"? 


































 Harrys own voice said, then, sounding strange in present-Harrys ears, He has a surprisingly good explanation.

Why did Harry say that? Obviously, the direct cause of that statement was that Future!Harry remembered hearing it while he was Present!Harry. However, this doesn't explain the real cause. We know from elsewhere in HPMOR that time seems to do that kind of stuff when there would otherwise be a paradox. So this sentence implies that, had Harry not known of a good explanation coming, something would have happened that would cause him to try to change time. What was that? What would have happened had he not been told that, that was drastic enough to cause Time Itself to twist? Remember, Harry knows Not To Mess With Time, so it would have to be **really really important** for him to try doing something.

(I'd also like to point out that, since he heard the explanation while anticipating a good one, he is automatically subject to confirmation bias, meaning he would notice less if it wasn't good, without any Harry ever deciding it was good by "himself".) 




 I've read a little bit about this "net neutrality" thingy and I don't really get why it is a good thing.

As I understand it, we (the protesters) want the FCC or whoever to keep *more* regulations. That's the first red flag. I haven't seen any explanation of why the free market wouldn't work in this case.

Second, if your ISP started slowing down smaller websites, what would you do? Well, what if there was another ISP that wanted your business, and they offered equal speeds for all websites? You know what would happen? Three guesses:

* Everyone switches to ISP #2
* Everyone switches to ISP #2
* Everyone switches to ISP #2

That's called a free market. Do you know why Sprint still offers unlimited data for smartphones after all the other US carriers started limiting the amounts? Because there's a market for it. There are people who would switch away from Sprint to whoever offered a better service.

If all these people who signed, called, emailed, and otherwise joined the campaign, instead signed a petition that they would switch away from any ISP that doesn't give all website the same bandwidth, wouldn't that create significant incentives to ISPs to maintain the status quo? And companies that might pay for faster speeds will get less people to reach with them, so the prices will go down, and the ISP will not be gaining that much, so they'll switch back to neutrality soon.

I'm willing to change my view if someone can explain what I'm missing. I'm trying to understand, and don't get it. So why does the free market fail in this instance, and why is the government needed to step in? 




 Well in chapter 9:

Though Harry had been right to consult a Ravenclaw prefect first. The young woman hadn't even looked up from her reading or identified Harry, just jabbed a wand in Neville's direction and muttered something. After which Neville had acquired a dazed expression and wandered off to the fifth carriage from the front and the fourth compartment on the left, which indeed had contained his toad.

So there's a prefect (possibly Penelope Clearwater, possibly not) who knows some mind control methods, hanging around Hogwarts and Harry. I don't think a simple charm could have done that, it seems like it would need Legilimency to get the information and Confundus, Legilimency, or Imperious to get Neville to go there. I don't see any way around the Legilimency requirement, which is "incredibly rare", and thus suspicious. Is there any other method that could have been done with standard magic, or should we be *very* suspicious of unnamed prefect?

(I suppose it could have been done by hiding the toad in a known location beforehand, then sending Neville there with a standard Confundus, but it doesn't seem like she was setting it up, and she wouldn't know that she would be approached [or she could have Confunded Harry and Neville to approach her specifically, but we're getting complexity penalties at this point.]) 




 I don't know if this theory has been proposed before, but what if

The curse on the Defence job works like the Comed-tea? That is, only wizards who are going to get caught doing a fireable offense during the next year get unexplained urges to work at Hogwarts? That might explain Quirrell's stated reason for working at Hogwarts, if he is not QuirrellMort.

Are there other plausible hypothesis for how the curse works?

It appears that only documents are included, based on filenames extensions. It also appears that many documents not in txt format were converted to txt. They were then published twice, once in original format and a second time in txt format. Not all documents, for some reason. So the true amount of documents published now is a little over a half of 30,000.

The following formats are in the list:

* xlsx
* pdf
* txt
* docx

This suggests both that Wikileaks published only "document files", not all files (and horrible reporting by those who don't have a clue), and that they only took from the 01, 02, 05, and bonus filesets.

I'll confirm when I have more time whether any documents from the other sets appear in wikileaks list, as the naming *could* just be a quirk.

Edit: nvm, it's up. https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/120/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality 









 As you know, there has been a lot of speculation that we are still in the DATA EXPUNGED. There are a couple of variations on this theme, but they all agree that REDACTED and that it really *was* REDACTED. On my recent reread, I noted all the parts in the text which appeared to support the claim that DATA EXPUNGED, and am collecting them here. There's also a section on WoG confirmations which can be REDACTED.

First, we get this right in the beginning:

Ad-free mirror of the text;

clearly implying that the entire text is inside a mirror (see document 297-T-REDACTED for further elaboration on this).

Second, we see in the intro what appears to be an obvious DATA EXPUNGED:

 This is a rationalist story;

Rationalist comes from ancient Latin from mirror. In fact, if you search google for Rationalist mirror, [hpmor comes up](https://archive.today/KzShE). But this might not be conclusive, because of REDACTED and REDACTED.

Third, we get in Chapter 6 the following

There was an abstracted look on her face (almost exactly the same look that had appeared on Harry's own face while experimenting on the pouch, if Harry had only seen himself in a mirror to realise that).

This is obviously foreshadowing DATA EXPUNGED and DATA EXPUNGED, as well as providing strong evidence that people are stuck in a mirror and can't see through it.


Fourth, there is the widely talked about DATA EXPUNGED from Chapter 6

As his hand touched the back door's handle, he heard a last whisper from behind him.

"Hermione Granger."

"What?" Harry said, his hand still on the door.

"Look for a first-year girl named Hermione Granger on the train to Hogwarts."

"Who is she?"

There was no answer, and when Harry turned around, Professor McGonagall was gone.

This strongly implies that Professor REDACTED was left out of the DATA EXPUNGED, for reasons too obvious to detail.

Further on, we observe (Chapter 10)

I am in essence a sort of mirror with which to trap children

possibly the most explicit confession in-story to date, with the possible exception of DATA EXPUNGED

Then we get to 27

The Weasley twins had tested their new monocles on the "forbidden" third-floor corridor, making a quick trip to the magic mirror, but when they tried to go back, they'd realized they were stuck forever.

Moving on, Chapter 37:

"Yes!" said Dumbledore. "My own great foe was Grindelwald, and him I understood very well indeed. Grindelwald was my dark mirror, the man I could so easily have been, had I given in to the temptation to believe that I was free of the mirror, and therefore sure of my observations.

This is starting to give some clues that the mirror is connected to Grindelwald. I looked through REDACTED to find more clues, and sure enough DATA EXPUNGED:

 I am Grindelwald. I am also the mirror, and have been so all along. I am also [Millicent Bulstrode](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2f7csv/whats_the_craziest_theory_you_can_come_up_with/ck6mynp). Indeed, I am even DATA EXPUNGED. You are also.

So we know where it came from.

Next, let's look at chapter 54

Thirty seconds later Harry was the proud new owner of a curved mirror, and quickly walked into it (which confused his mind for a bit, before he got distracted by whatever he wanted).

And

The mirror lay alive and vibrant in his hand.

And

his mirror was perfect

This confirms that it infected Harry early on, but in case you're uncertain see 63:

 Harry had been infected by the mirror for as long as he could remember

Now, one thing we *haven't* confirmed is whether Hermione is in the REDACTED. Chapter 72:

Hermione reached into her robes, and drew out a little rod with a mirror on the end of it and an eyepiece. The mirror quickly took over her body and mind, leaving her in eternel bliss.

Plus this bit of REDACTED from 77:

Hermione hadn't tried walking past a mirror yet, she wasn't sure she wanted to.

Plus a little later in 84 we get confirmation that the mirror is responsible for Hermione dying:

The mirror cut off abruptly.

Susan, 73:

For an instant, she glowed in a strange mirror-color, like a reflection of herself, until the mirror swallowed her whole

Tracey, 74:

Well, I'm pretty sure I did," said Tracey, sounding briefly uncertain before she rallied. "I mean, I looked at myself in a mirror and I look paler and can make my wishes come true now, and I can always feel darkness surrounding me, and I was a conduit for his dread powers and everything...

Pansy, 74:

After Pansy drew out a mirror and looked at herself, she turned even paler.

Now we know where it came from, who it infected, DATA EXPUNGED and REDACTED, but who has it now? Let's look at 82:

Terrible and stern stood the ancient wizard, like he was carven from stone; beard woven of thread like iron, half-moon glasses like mirrors, and the pupils behind as sharp and unyielding as black diamond.

So there *was* a pair of glasses that [wasn't just that](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2x4lxu/im_way_better_at_having_bad_ideas_than_good_ones/), after all.

Now, there's also a piece of evidence suggesting that DATA EXPUNGED, as well as proving that the REDACTED can hold multiple people at once (84):

The mirror transmitted a sound of muffled laughter in the background, sounding like it was coming from more than one person.

Let's skip to 100:

The mirror was in Draco's hand, and it remained lifeless as his finger mechanically tapped at the surface, over and over.

This is definite foreshadowing of the mirror breaking at some future point, which is consistent with information gotten from REDACTED.

WORDS OF GOD

There are a couple of statements from the author of reality, REDACTED, which provide support for this theory.

1. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xxybs/chapter_116/cp4fzlj?context=3) THEY'RE IN THE MIRROR

2. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xxybs/chapter_116/cp4hnx1?context=3) You're inside the mirror
3. [here](http://hpmor.com/notes/119/) yes they are still inside the Mirror of DATA EXPUNGED.

(Note: this last one is proof that even the events up to 119 are still part of REDACTED.)


Note: this was inspired by https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w3z8p/its_been_in_front_of_us_all_along_spoilers_all/, and also by SCP. This is also a first draft, if you have any suggestions on how to make this flow better I'm open. I'm not too good at structuring long things like this.

18 minutes and counting! 
























 ... or just patent it then sue. It's a lot easier.

 First of all: I've seen parts of this out there already. I came up with this mostly on my own, trying to be original, but there's obviously not *too* much to work with, and I had already seen some attempts.

So. Harry has been told that the first thing done to him is Stunning. The obvious step here, is:

Partially transfigure himself. Harry transfigures two layers of the skin around his entire body. The outer layer is transfigured into dead skin (or something the same color), so he still looks normal. The inner layer is transfigured into a substance which blocks (preferably absorbs) at least the stunning spell.

Two tiny layers of skin coming off should be perfectly safe (have not gotten an answer from a doctor here, so don't try this at home).

He delays while talking to V as long as possible. When he's done, they "stun" him. He falls down, and makes sure his wand is pointed towards his time-turner.

He should have at least a few minutes before they begin chopping off his limbs, during which their guard will be down. He uses this to transfigure his skin into a line of *something* (will elaborate) towards his time-turner. This substance is designed to look like the surrounding air, so it is effectively invisible. Once it is in contact with the time-turner, Harry is able to transfigure the time-turner, then untransfigure it to right beside him. It is still hidden by the camouflage transfiguration. He then gets the time-turner into his hands, and twists it.

As soon as he is in the past, he sends a message to Moody, Bones, and Dumbledore, and tries to leave.

Anyway, if there are any ideas here anyone feels are new, feel free to take them and use them in your own answer. 














 ... the update notices (i.e. "the next update will be") are still there. Has /u/EliezerYudkowsky  gotten lazy or does that mean anything?

 Is it before Harry got the message? Surely summoning all the Death Eaters would notify Dumbledore, and he'd send someone to pick up Harry like by Azkaban. This didn't happen, so something I believe must be false.

Even if it's after, someone would go back in time, or know that they couldn't.

Also, where is this? Are we at the graveyard, or a "real" one assuming the one dosed was fake, or somewhere else? 




 ... that current!Harry is missing some memories, and that was masterminded by the good guys (either himself or Dumbledore). Additionally, this is causing him to act in a way that appears non-optimal, but is necessary for reasons that will be explained. (Possibly because he needs to believe some things to say them in Parseltongue.)
