 Maybe 3-4 yrs old. Could've been Christmas. Eve. Parents let siblings and I open a present. I got a Looney Tunes puzzles cos I distinctly remember porky pig. 




 Religion. And real country music. 




 Led Zeppelin. 




 My dad gave me his belt too from when he was in his early 20s. It doesn't fit me since I'm a girl but I still have it. It has his initials engraved into the leather. 




 Failing my first year of college. If I could just go back and do it all over, I would. I wouldn't lie to my parents about how well college is going. I wouldn't spend the next years depressed, unmotivated, and feeling lost in life. 




 It can happen. I have native cousins who have blonde ish hair, pale skin, and I saw a native baby with blue eyes. My mom made me to over to look at the baby just for his eyes. I also have cousins who are pretty brown. 




 Pistol Annies - Annie Up 




 Electromagnetism. I just can't... understand. What is this witchcraft? 




 Not sure if it's a sixth sense and not sure if it's at all impressive since it requires close proximity but I can sense when someone is close to me. When I was a kid my siblings found it amusing though. They would stand behind me and then let their hands hover over my back and I would feel this weird tingling feeling over the exact spot. It's come in handy though. My family is all fairly close and relatives are often visiting each other at all hours of the day/night. When I was in my early teens, I went to bed early because it was a school night. I left my door open because I was terrified of evil spirits and ghosts and felt safer with the door open. I fell asleep. Then I woke up. My right thigh was tingling. I shot up and there was my male cousin crouched beside my bed with his hand hovering over my leg. He told me he just wanted to ask if I had any CD-Rs. I told him I didn't and he left. Turns out, he'd been groping female relatives while they slept. He grew out of it but the family has kind of ... ostracized him since. 




 When I was living with my sister, we had our first fire drill in our apartment. I ran out the door and went downstairs to the lobby. My sister followed right behind me with her wallet, our cat, and her cell phone. Nowadays I'd probably just grab the kids and dogs and leave. I can't remember where I ever leave my wallet or cellphone so screw looking for it. 




 Family recommended the show to me because it was funny. I watched an episode and couldn't watch anymore. It came off scripted. 




 I watched Glee for awhile so I can say the only episode I liked was the very first one. It all went downhill from there. 




 Homemaker. I'm single with no kids. But that won't stop me. 




 I sent a text message to the wrong number. I inverted the last two digits. I thought I was texting my brother in law. He was with my sister when her phone died so I joked that I was stalking her. The text receiver didn't appreciate the joke. Turns out a girl he knew shared the same name as my sister. I explained myself and apologized. 




 For me, the most useful info is that drowning is silent and isn't the flailing around and shouting you see in movies/TV. My nieces and nephews love swimming and our beach doesn't have a lifeguard. Someone drowned there recently. 




 That sucks. My mom forgot her iPhone in a public restroom. Mine was stolen when I forgot it in a bookstore, so my mom was happy a cleaning lady found hers. Since those things cost about $700, my mom gave her $40 for finding it. 




 US Netflix, Spotify, and Hulu. 




 Had one drink at 18. Didn't drink alcohol for years afterwards. Family has a few recovering alcoholics so I just didn't see a point to drinking. First time I got drunk was on my sisters birthday. Made sure to drink a lot of water. Stopped drinking when I felt myself losing my ability to walk straight. Growing up shy and self aware has only made me very aware of how drunk I am. Tipped the waitress alot but I do that sober too. 




 Punched myself in the face too except i was trying to stuff a sleeping bag into its sack. 




 "We should get a mini freezer and just fill it up with TV dinners." 




 Jack from Lost. I hated that guy. 
























 I would probably have a panic attack. Cry a lot. Call my sister. No answer, travel to her apartment. Cry some more. Then take her car and drive a whole day to my parents house. Find my family and bury them all at the family plot. Take my dogs and live at my parents cabin teaching myself survival skills hoping I learn enough to survive. 




 Not a book but Thomas Nagel's The Absurd. It expressed and validated everything I felt my whole life. After reading that I decided that the meaning of life is to give life meaning. Felt 1000x happier. 




 I'll play Mario Kart 64, Star Fox, Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and Cruisin USA on the Wii every once in awhile. 




 I recently bought the Season One DVD. I can't decided now whether or not it's a good idea to watch it right now. I may binge watch. 




 Glee. It hit all the right teen angsty notes. And the rest of the show sucked after that. 




 Home - Dixie Chicks 




 The saying "it takes a village to raise a child" applies to my big family. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins are not afraid to discipline each other's kids or call each other out on shitty parenting. Sometimes we'll recruit a relative we think will be most effective to talk to another relative about their actions or behaviour. 




 They drive to the next town or drink in their homes where the cops can't see them. 




 I was 12 years old. Hometown has an adult dance after the family dance. This was before the town's alcohol ban so it was a pretty popular dance for the adults. I spent New Years at my grandmas where she was also watching her other grandkids whose parents also went to the adult dance. She didn't have a tv so we played card games all night. At midnight people started shooting blanks from their guns cos thats a thing here for big events. 




 Sunny Sweeney, Lee Ann Womack, Laura Cantrell, Jamey Johnson, the Secret Sisters. Still patiently waiting for their albums! 




 Amazons and Gladiators. The Room. In The Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale. All damn horrible. 




 Get "acoustic earplugs". I got some for $7 after I went to a rock/metal show. Didn't need them at all for country concerts though.. 




 As a girl who didn't know the difference between a tank top and a camisole, i have no damn clue either. 




 Believe what the tv tells them. 




 Boulder to Birmingham - Emmylou Harris

Whats Up - 4 Non Blondes 




 The movie "Giant". James Deen, Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson. I watched it on TCM one boring evening. Now whenever someone mentions they don't like old movies, I tell them to watch that. But it is a very long movie but worth it. 




 The Glass Castle - Jeanette Walls

The Alchemist - Paulo Coelho
 




 I really like being your friend. I think we could be very good lifetime friends. You make me feel like I'm capable of so much more. I'm also happy you're more comfortable with sharing your thoughts and feelings with me because it makes me feel closer to you. I don't want to lose you. But, if you're hoping for more than a friendship, it isn't gonna happen. 




 The Sarah Connor Chronicles. I'd never been so pissed off at a cancellation before or after and I'm still upset at my friend for introducing me to the show. 




 I tried this and my dogs understood but he just didn't care. 




 I sometimes think it's cultural and maybe a little bit biological. My dad is shy as well as my sister and me. My adopted siblings are not shy and neither is my mom. I was shy because I was incredibly self aware and that made me very self conscious. I had a happy childhood and was never bullied. Kids were always nice to me. I was sheltered a lot too. My dad and my sister learned to cope with their shyness by creating public personas but they're still very much introverts. I didn't create a public persona for myself but I learned to control my shyness after years of practice because I was tired of being shy. I'm still introverted though. It took years of practice, years of awkward moments, stilted conversation, and trial and error to learn to cope with my shyness and make friends for the first time ever. Dealing with my shyness is still an ongoing process.

I do think shyness is related to a fear of rejection. When I'm struggling with my shyness and force myself to be confident, I feel a sense of fear and if I feel I'm "rejected", it fucking hurts. But I think "fuck it," life is too short. I heal that rejection and move on.

I also think it's cultural because my old hometown was a very shy town. The people were just shy towards outsiders unless the outsider goes out of their way to be friendly, then they're accepted into the fold. But the new generation is not like this. They're very outgoing, friendly, and eager to experience new things.
