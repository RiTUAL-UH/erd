 Other than 'God bless you', or 'bless you', what is a good post sneeze saying?

Could be popular or original. Witty or humorous. Something out of the ordinary.

Does anybody have a go to phrase? 

























































































 I am biased, because my league gives points for KR yardage, and he has been doing quite well for me thus far. I have seen many people eager to drop him after tonights weak offensive performance and subsequent injury. If not currently starting caliber, would he not be worth at least a spot on most benches due to his speed and breakout potential once Bridgewater returns and/or the Vikings get their offensive shit together?

Also does anybody have any additional information on the status of his hip injury?

I've heard some good things about this kid. What is the inside scoop? 









 I have read many creepy things about certain parts of Black Mountain in Queensland (South of Cooktown), including the disappearance of many people and animals which venture to the rocks. Most notable is Yirrmbal, which is said to be considered "taboo" among the locals.

As an outsider, I am very curious to hear the locals take on the area. Any personal stories, local legends, friend-of-a-friend accounts, or recent strange experiences would be greatly appreciated.

Let's get weird.

 Date of Post: 5/22/2014

Date of Event: 5/11/2014

"I was asleep. I woke up with a need to go outside. I went out, there was a light shining on a rock. I touched the rock and was given a vision. I've never had visions, I'm not mentally ill and not even interested in this and certainly won't talk about it. I've been married to a narcotics detective twenty years with two teenage boys. I'm not a sceptic or a believer to this point. When I touched this rock within 30 seconds I was given thousands of years of history of how "aliens" were here many thousand years ago and what they are doing. I was given information that a planet knew many thousand years ago their planets Sun would die. They wanted to make a new home. They found our planet they found out conditions were comparable to them. They have decided they didn't want to do the necessary things that need done to make the planet functional for them. They showed pictures of different species to develop the planet they experimented with. They showed me the help they have given along the way. They need certain things mined built and ready for them. They have given certain scientists and others knowledge the way it was given to me. They gave us religion so we work together because ants work well together, bees work well together but they had to make us more advanced to get us to work together, religion. They have given us the ability to understand how to process DNA but only the knowledge to use it minimally. They gave us fear of criminals and criminal elements so eventually the world will have every humans DNA filed from birth. They are able to read which of the humans by that they will keep when they come. I'm not religious per say but the rapture as we understand it is somewhat true but based on our genes. Almost like whatever people they need to further them will be used. They have astronauts kind of like we do that intervene if necessary, but it would have taken them too many resources to prepare our planet, that's why we are here and they give us motivations to go in the direction they want. They need mercury gold other metals. They need computers much more sophisticated than what we have, we are laying their groundwork. They will live in harmony with us to the best of their ability when they come,but not everyone will benefit the society. That's why we have been given DNA knowledge. I can't write everything I was shown it would take forever. But the information was given to me in thirty seconds. I don't know why ME, I'm nobody just a mother disabled with lupus. I spent 8 years in army reserves as supply specialist ages ago. There is absolutely nothing extraordinary about me. The light was a v shape the size of a small plane. The beam that came down was like a laser beam and I could do nothing but walk to where it shone and touch it. It didn't hurt it felt like nothing, but in the 30 seconds I was there I was given 3 lifetimes of information. It was specific it was visual and I retained it. I don't want to ever tell anyone this because they will think I'm nuts. I would think they were nuts. But I thought someone should have this knowledge,nd your the only people on the Yahoo I could see to tell. It's not like I can call the president and tell him.
Anyway I wish there was a way I could give you all the things I learned, but I'm a busy mom and don't want to be responsible for this information, I really just want to forget it but my brain keeps putting it back no matter what else I try to think about. So I'm hoping I told you it will be over. A lot of the information I was given I don't even understand. But cave people were not the first people. We have been started over on more than one occasion. They have to be careful we have enough information to advance the planet where they want it but not too much where we blow our planet up and ruin it. They are walking a tightrope of sorts and not even as 'll them always agree and we are a work in progress.
Thank you for taking this information, hopefully it's not mine anymore.

 If you are passionate about e-cigarettes, and more importantly freedom of choice, I urge you to boycott the Vuze brand, which is owned by RJ Reynolds. 

If you haven't yet heard, RJ Reynolds has recently typed up a 120 page report, which it then sent on to the FDA, urging them to make all open air mods illegal. Open air mods include any type of e-cigarette that can be re-filled by the user with the e-liquid of their choice.
 
The report is filled with bullshit reasoning including that open air mods are more dangerous and more easily accessible to children. That's right, one of the leading cigarette manufactures in the world is claiming that open air mods are dangerous and should be made illegal. Ironic that RJ Reynolds has suddenly formed a conscience, isn't it?

Not surprisingly, closed air e-cigarettes such as Blu and Vuze are not mentioned in this write up. 

In reality, this is a blatant attempt by RJ Reynolds to force their main competition out of the market by attempting to sway the FDA with sensationalized pseudo-facts and industry clout. Criminalizing open air mods would in effect give RJ Reynolds a near monopoly in the US e-cig market, forcing consumers who have decided to quit tobacco cigarettes into buying RJ Reynolds e-cig products and continuous cartridge refills. 

I urge all of you who are passionate about this innovative and emerging market to show RJ Reynolds that we will not stand for corrupt politics and business practices.

People are quitting tobacco cigarettes at an astounding rate, and RJ Reynolds is desperate to keep their hands in our pockets. 

Not to mention, I bought a Vuze before i found out about their letter to the FDA and it absolutely SUCKED. Worst e-cig product I have ever had the displeasure of using.

**Take a stand against blatant corruption. Boycott Vuze and all RJ Reynolds products, companies, and subsidiaries.**

 In regard to *hypothetically* seeking employment/potential upcoming drug test.

If you smoked 1 hit /day for a month, as opposed to smoking 4-5 bowls with a group (lets say on average 3 hits per bowl) each day for a month, approximately how long would it take each person to piss clean for a drug test. Would it be the same? Or would the 1 hit method have an advantage?

Lets assume the standard 30 days no smoking to be safe for the 4-5 bowl smoker. I guess the question would be, if somebody only smokes 1 hit per day for a 30 day cycle, is there any advantage in being able to quit smoking maybe a couple of weeks before the test as opposed to the standard 30 days? 









 I have an original CDV (Carte de Visite) photograph of a particularly famous gentleman from the Civil War era. His name is Owen Lovejoy, and he was a congressman, judge, Underground Railroad Conductor, and good friend of Abraham Lincoln. He helped introduce the final slavery ending bill to Congress.

My CDV is also signed on the front. The signature reads "Hon. Owen Lovejoy". The only place I have been able to find an original example of this CDV is in the NYPL (New York Public Library) Digital Gallery here;

+ http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchdetail.cfm?strucID=136488 imageID=115768

This is the exact CDV i have, only the one I have possesses a signature.
 
I believe this is his most famous image, and also the one Wikipedia uses as their main photo, here;

+ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Lovejoy

The photographer is J. Gurney   Son, located at 707 Broadway, New York.

From the NYPL write up, I was able to determine that this photo was part of this collection: "The Pageant of America" Collection / v.8 - Builders of the Republic / (unpublished photographs) / Portraits

That is where the trail ends, as I have been unable to find any other relevant information on this specific photograph, nor could I find much on the Pageant of America collection in general.

The CDV i possess was found in a civil war era photo album and dates somewhere between 1840-1870, I believe.

Is there anybody in this sub who could possibly provide me with more information on this particular CDV such as it's scarcity or possible historical value?

Finally, here are front and back photos of my CDV:

 Firstly, let me say that my condolences go out to the family members of the missing crew and passengers on MH370.

Secondly, I would like to clarify that the following analysis is a THEORY of mine, and while SPECULATION, it is based on known facts and inference relating to the events that transpired since lost radio contact. Trolls are not welcome here, constructive comments only.

I have been following the emerging details of this case very closely since the initial incident. From early on, I have maintained that this was no accident, and either the pilot(s) or separate hijackers were involved in this planes calculated disappearance. The evidence that has emerged since then has only served to strengthen my initial hypothesis.

**Here how I think it went down...**

+ After takeoff, before MH370 reaches the East Coast of Malaysia, the ACARS system is manually turned off by one of the pilots in the cabin.

+ After crossing into the Gulf, before reaching Vietnam, Malaysia air control contacts MH370, informing them that they are about to enter Vietnamese airspace, and their air traffic controllers will soon be taking over communications. The time is aprox. 1:30 am, it is at this time the co-pilot says "Ok. Goodnight" to Malaysian air traffic controllers. (Notice the nonchalant 'goodnight' *AFTER* the ACARS is turned off, indicating it was not done under duress.) **This is the last successful radio contact with MH370**

+ Pilot manually switches off the transponder signal, which now joins the ACARS as being disabled.

+ It is at this point that I believe the pilot(s) manually initiated a leak in the cabin's air pressure control system, slowly depressurizing the cabin. To those passengers inside the cabin, they would not know anything is wrong, and would slowly become drowsy with gradual oxygen loss. 

+ 5 minutes after last radio contact, at roughly 1:35 am, the plane is said to ascend to approx. 45,000 feet. **Keep in mind, this is above the planes service ceiling and this maneuver would never be done under normal circumstances, as there is a chance the plane could stall.** I believe that coupled with the manual cabin depressurization, this move was performed in order to kill the passengers on board. 

+ Following this maneuver, the plane is said to make a sharp turn to the west, coupled with a rapid decent to around 20,000 feet. (In my opinion, this erratic decent could have been planned to make it appear to radar operators as if there was a cockpit struggle taking place. It could also be a result of a stall or near-stall.)

+ When the plane never reaches Vietnamese airspace, and radio contact cannot be made with MH370, ground control contacts a separate airplane to attempt radio contact with MH370. The pilot reports back that he could only hear mumbling, static, and interference coming from MH370's end. **I believe this is consistent with the pilot(s)wearing his oxygen mask(s), after depressurizing the plane.**

+ At this point the plane flies west, back over Malaysia, and follows known aviation waypoints through the Strait of Malacca, toward the Indian Ocean. The movements of the plane coupled with the following of known waypoints indicates an experienced and current pilot being in control of MH370.

+ The plane continues to be pinged for up to 7 hours after initial lost radio contact. This indicates that the plane is still flying, as a crashed plane or one that has landed and been "shut off" will not ping.

+ 8:11 am, over 6 hours after last radio contact, satellite ping information puts the plane on the perimeter of a half circle, either west of Australia, or west of China. (The exact location is not known from the ping, just a general distance from the satellite.) *It is my belief that the plane headed south toward Australia, as a northerly route would take it directly over many countries whose air defense / radar systems would have surely picked it up.*

**I DO NOT BELIEVE THE PLANE CRASHED! It is my belief that this plane was taken, for use at a later date, in some sort of 9/11-esque plot. It is not my belief that Zaharie was the mastermind behind this plot, rather just the executor of this particular stage.**

+ I believe the plane may have been landed in Australia, Indonesia, or somewhere close to where it was last determined to be located on the southerly track of the 8:11 am ping. After landing, the plane will be immediately painted over and 're-branded' so to speak. The transponders will be swapped/updated, and the plane will essentially be ready to fly again with no links to MH370.

+ NOTE ZAHARIE'S FLIGHT SIMULATOR. In a recent interview with CNN, a close friend of Zaharie's says the simulator can be programmed with custom scenarios. **It is my belief that Zaharie may have practiced this particular flight many many times, in preparation. This would also afford him the knowledge of how far he could fly on a given amt. of fuel.**

+ It has been reported that Zaharie's family moved out of their house the day before the flight went missing. Zaharie is also said to be a 'political fanatic', whose idol Anwar Ibrahim, was just convicted of sodomy and sentenced to 5 years in prison, **one day before MH370 went missing**. This conviction is being viewed by many Malaysians as political persecution, and Zaharie allegedly expressed his disgust at the verdict.

+ Recently, a credible threat is investigated after Al-Qaeda supergrass told court that four or five Malaysian men planned a passenger airliner hijack. According to the Al-Qaeda member, **ONE OF THOSE MEN IS A MALAYSIAN PILOT.** http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/10700652/Malaysia-Airline-MH370-911-style-terror-allegations-resurface-in-case-of-lost-plane.html

+ It is clear to me, and anybody in the know, that humans played a direct roll in this planes disappearance. This can be inferred by the intelligent movements made by the plane and the specific tracking features that were manually disabled. While I cannot rule out the possibility of hijackers gaining control of the cockpit, the circumstances and timing of this event lead me toward believing one or both of the pilots were directly involved. **THIS WAS NOT CATASTROPHIC SYSTEMS FAILURE. THIS WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT. THIS WAS A WELL EXECUTED PLAN, THAT LIKELY TOOK YEARS TO DESIGN.**

+ I do not think this was a pilot suicide. The plane is said to intentionally avoid radar installations and detection once crossing into the Straight of Malacca. There is no reason for a pilot to strategically fly 7 hours off course, just to crash the plane in a more remote section of ocean.

+ From the moment of the plane's last radio contact, everything about this case signifies detailed and well thought out planning, even down to the time of morning this occurred. I believe these events were perpetrated at this hour because it would give them the most time to get away and cover their tracks. The plane was not even reported missing until 6-7 hours after last radio contact, and even then, Malaysian authorities made it seem like the plane had crashed.

In conclusion, unfortunately, I think this event is just the first stage of a much larger plan. I do not think we have seen the last of MH370. I really hope I am wrong. 

EDIT: Or they could just find the plane in the ocean... or at least a piece of wreckage linking to a 777. Then the truth should be in the black boxes. But if nothing at all is found wreckage wise, I'd be concerned.

EDIT 2: Updated for new information.

TL; DR - The plane didn't crash. I believe it may have landed for use in future terrorist activities.

Tell HN: Meeting Satoshi

163 points by yuxt 10 hours ago | 98 comments

back in 2011 I convinced my wife who ran a small creperie in DUMBO, Brooklyn to start accepting bitcoins. We were one of the first in the world physical location that accepted this new digital currency [1]. In the next couple of month we received a lot of attention, but no one has purchased anything with btc. Then one day, my wife calls me and informs that there is someone who would like to pay with bitcoins. I got excited and asked her to take a picture of the guy because he is the first one and it's a historic moment for us. He bought 2 crepes and paid using his smartphone and our QR code with btc address. One crepe and a lemonade was 1 bitcoin at that time :)
After he finished his food my wife approached him and asked to take a picture of him for being the first. He blushed and politely declined citing that bitcoin is an anonymous currency. He wished us well, added that bitcoins should already be in our account and left.

My wife called me back and revealed that he refused to take a picture. So I asked her to describe him. She portrayed the guy as a humble polite Japanese man in his 50s. We joked maybe it was Satoshi, but I dismissed the idea. I assumed it was some one from Mt Gox since it was located in Japan.

Today I showed the picture of Satoshi in Newsweek to my wife and she recognized him.

Let's say you were to enter starvation mode, and your body needed to burn stored fat for energy. Would the oldest fat in your body be burned first (FIFO)? Or would the newest accumulated fat be burnt first (LIFO)?

 http://fox43.com/2013/01/09/state-senator-proposes-legalizing-marijuana-in-pennsylvania/#axzz2qr1Lltmn

Here is Leachs letter on the subject:

"This past November, the people of Washington State and Colorado voted to fully legalize marijuana. Other places, including California, have had de facto legalization for some time. This week, I will introduce legislation which would have Pennsylvania join these other states in ending this modern-day prohibition. My bill will legalize the consumption of marijuana for adults over the age of twenty one, without regard to the purpose of that consumption. Heres why:

For the past 75 years, our marijuana policy has been foolish, ill-conceived, costly and destructive, and it must end.  We have been waging a war on drugs that includes treating the use of Marijuana as a matter for the criminal justice system. We have spent billions of dollars investigating, prosecuting, incarcerating and monitoring millions of our fellow citizens who have hurt no one, damaged no property, breached no peace. Their only crime was smoking a plant which made them feel a bit giddy.

People across our Commonwealth have spent time in prison, lost time at work, been forced to hire lawyers and had their lives disrupted and sometimes destroyed because they used a product less dangerous than beer, less risky than childrens cough syrup, less addictive than chocolate and whose societal harm comes from its prohibition rather than its use.

According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, in 2006, an average year, 24,685 marijuana arrests were made in Pennsylvania at a cost to the taxpayers of $325.36 million. Each year we not only waste a similar amount, we leave several hundred million dollars on the table in taxes that we do not collect because marijuana is illegal, rather than regulated and taxed. Aside from the moral issues involved, we simply can no longer afford the financial costs of prohibition.

Further, prohibition of marijuana has done what it did in the case of alcohol in the 1930s. It has created a dangerous black market with violent and bloody turf wars that kill many people in our country and elsewhere. The original prohibition brought us the St. Valentines Day Massacre. The modern prohibition has brought us gun battles in the streets between drug cartels. The murders associated with the sale of alcohol ended with prohibition. The same will be true of marijuana.

To be clear, under the terms of this legislation marijuana would be a regulated product, treated in a way similar to how alcohol is treated. It will still be illegal to drive under the influence of marijuana, behave badly while publicly intoxicated or to sell it to minors.

Further, like alcohol, legalization and regulation will make marijuana safer.  People will no longer have to buy it on the streets from criminals who may have laced their product with other dangerous drugs. People buying legally will know exactly what they are getting and be able to rely on the safety of what they are purchasing.

The sad history of prohibition is that marijuana was legal, and in fact the most prescribed drug in that nation until the late 1930s. At that time, it was targeted by those who had an economic interest in removing it from the market. Today, prohibition is supported by myths, misconceptions and old wives tales that no longer stand up to scientific scrutiny.

For example, in response to my bill, Governor Corbett said he opposed it because he believes marijuana is a gateway drug. But science has clearly established that this is untrue. Well over 90 percent of those who use marijuana never go on to use harder drugs, and the percentage of people who do use hard drugs and had previously used marijuana is no higher than the percentage who had previously only tried beer.

The facts are that unlike alcohol, you simply cannot overdose on marijuana. Unlike alcohol and tobacco, marijuana is not physically addictive. Studies have shown that people on marijuana are much less likely to behave violently or recklessly than people who are drunk. And while breathing a hot gas into your lungs certainly isnt good for them, marijuana smokers on average smoke far less often than tobacco smokers. There is simply no way that marijuana does, or ever can, come close to killing the 1,100 people per day that tobacco does.

Yet despite all of this, you can drink and smoke tobacco freely. But if you smoke marijuana, you are a criminal and can go to jail. This horrific policy must end. People around the nation are realizing that. And it is a moral imperative that Pennsylvania wake up and end prohibition now." 














 Let me preface this by saying that I do not know much about cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, other than the basics.

But in regard to the marijuana industry's current issue with banks..

http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/us/banks-say-no-to-marijuana-money-legal-or-not.html?_r=0

Would it be at all feasible to create a cryptocurrency, Potcoin for example, and use that currency exclusively within the marijuana industry as a means of storing/investing/transferring money?

If that is not realistic, wouldn't a partnering of Bitcoin and the marijuana industry as it expands from state to state be a great idea for both parties?

What are your thoughts? 









 Since grabbing the KC Chiefs D/ST off the FA wire after week 1, the Seattle Seahawks D/ST has unfortunately been left sitting unused on my bench.

I am wondering what sort of trade value i should put on the Seahawks D/ST, if I were to attempt and move them straight up. Give me some examples of players at any position who would have a comparable value.

I like having the Seahawks D/ST on my bench, giving me the option of rotating the position on a weekly basis dependent on match-ups, however up until this point, I have started the Chiefs D each week (rightfully so) and feel like I may be wasting significant trade value which could be used to improve my starting lineup.

Should I keep the top 2 D's on my squad?

 But what if a little bit of the ice has melted, creating some liquid water? Does that make the whole bottle illegal? Or will they make you dump out the tiny bit of liquid water at the top of the bottle? What if the liquid water has formed on the bottom of the bottle, under the ice, and cannot be poured out? 

Will they take you in the back room and touch your b-hole for attempting to circumvent the rules with your snarky "frozen water" is not "liquid water" tirade?

 The Smellmaster 9000. I think Professor Keenbean already holds the patent on that device.  




 I love animals more than people. I would never. Unless I was attacked unprovoked... then it's on.  




 Nice desert wolf, bro.

Actually looks kinda cute, I'd probably try and play with it. 




 I would fuck a bobcat up. 




 u ded 




 Funny thing is you would probably do the same thing if you were locked in some aliens cage, and they were constantly staring at you from a far. Pointing. Mocking you.  




 The lion planned that. From your story, he even smiled and laughed to himself right before he blasted you. When you're locked in a cage, you have to create your own amusement.  




 Got that tektonic chronic that'll make you choke 




 Wut 




 Shut up. 




 Disregard the ignorance. I'm with you, buddy. 

People demand solid evidence when you bring up the topic of extraterrestrials visiting our planet, but fail to consider that the U.S. and other governments keep this subject classified at a level so high that only the top of the top has access to the information. In the past not even the President has been briefed on the subject unless in a "need to know" situation. People who come up with credible "proof" in the form of photograph/video have their original files confiscated or mysteriously lost or stolen. If their material does not go missing, they are threatened to keep quiet or face federal charges. In extreme cases, agents threaten physical harm to the leaker or their family if they choose to continue publicizing their story. On top of all that, there is an active disinformation campaign taking place serving to overload the public with bullshit/hoaxes/fake stories and sighting reports so that when something legitimate does come up, it will not be taken seriously and lumped in with the rest of the garbage. The topic of aliens is constantly met with laughs and jokes, *not because it is so improbable*, but because that's how we've been conditioned as a society to act toward the subject.

Acknowledging that aliens with a higher intelligence are visiting this planet would essentially brand all the governments of the world obsolete and irrelevant. Even more so when you take into account that they most likely do not know why the visitors are here and are powerless to stop them even if they deemed it necessary.  




 Now that's a reality show i can get behind.  




 Underwater cities?? Yes, please.  




 IT'S HAPPENING 




 Mushrooms are no joke bro. I mean any psychedelic is no joke, but your body can have some pretty adverse reactions to shrooms if you're not careful of potency/dosage/potential allergies. 




 mmmyyyesssss 




 Also took acid at the beach. One of the best times of my life. I saw... drones. Lots of them. 

"Actually" saw them, not "acid" saw them.  




  Growing up that's who i wanted to be/emulate whenever I played basketball. 

Ditto. From Philly. AI is legend.

Edit: Just a couple blokes from across the pond, both tryin' to be like AI. 




 Religion, woo!  




 I've got one in my dunge.... basem.... downstairs. I've got one downstairs. 




 Religion, woo! 









 Id hit it. 




 Cheers, m8! 




 Welcome to "The Watch List" 




 Sick! 




 "Good evening sir, I'd like to withdraw my life savings please. I'll take that all in ones." 




 Replace Bill Nye with Stephen Hawking and I'm down. 

Neil would totally be a bro and hold the j for S Hawk. 




 B. The spelunker in the vagina caves. 




 If I had that many tabs open at once, my computer would spontaneously combust.  




 Tabs on the timeline that say: Plot Setup, Foreplay, Blowjob, Cunnilingus, 69, Missionary, Cowgirl, Reverse Cowgirl, Doggy, Butt Stuff, Facial. In that order.  




 Monday. Suicide checks out.  




 Pussy pink like Nuvo and I dog that, Cujo 




 Clever girl... 




 Also, here's a good look at our current menu. 

https://www.trycaviar.com/philadelphia/tuk-tuk-real-958

The dishes themselves are mostly Mexican with different Thai spices and ingredients, depending on which you order. The Lamb Massaman Nachos would probably be our best (and most popular) example of a fusion dish.  




 Cheers! 




 Tuk Tuk Real on South Street. 




 Philly, close though. 




 Awesome, bro. I wish I was this creative.  




 WWED? 




 Bro, I work at a Thai-Mexican restaurant, you would love our Lamb Massaman Nachos. They're killer.

 You should end your life, not change it. 




 Can I hit it in the mornin' 




 Congrats at life.  




 Is all a nigga need. 




 And thank the lord. 




 Look into my big brown eye. A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long. 




 Look forward to trying some of these flavors.

Edit: Bought 2 sample packs. Came out to $40 including tax and shipping with the discount. Or about $3.33 a bottle. Can't beat that! Thanks guys. 




 Illuminati is conspiracy fact. 




 I feel like 90-95% of his target market thinks it's pretty cool too. Disc Golfers and weed go together like mashed potatoes and gravy. 

Edit: Ok, maybe it's more like 55-75% 




 Whatever lens this guy is using... I'll have that.  




 What am I looking at here... ? 




 We did Meth, Fag? 

Picture is accurate.

Confirmed. OP is the worst kindergarten teacher ever.  




 No WAY...

Mind = Blown.  




 I like to think this is how the universe came into existence... inadvertently... by accident.  




 Sounds like it :)

Sparking this bowl in honor of your pops. Cheers m8! 




 I heard this is how the MOB disposes of their bodies. No I didnt, but it would be awesome.  




 Bet 




  My father was one of the founders of Innova (big disc golf company)

Luckyy 




 Hyzer flip the bitch. 




 I need to get motivated to find some motivation.  




 Do it. 




 I think I just saw one in Philly 3-4 days ago. 




 You clever son of a bitch... 




 This is amazing. 




 This article says nothing about them doing anything physical whatsoever... 




 Mmm fried egg and bacon on a burger 




 Soy sauce spray........ GENIUS 




 Why would you soak shark fins in water and drink the broth? Oh yeah, the healing properties. 




 No. Their medicine tastes like root beer. 




 I would go the portable e-cig route with a dry-herb cartomizer/atomizer. Would be very cost effective, customizable, and portable/concealable. 




 Break up the door. Soak the wood in water until it had the consistency of wheat chex. Then add milk and sugar. Enjoy. 




 Those bastards! Honey Pit Cheerios.  




 Dat pineapple kush 




 So THAT'S why Michael Jordan was so good
