 I'm editing a multi-camera live concert video that was shot with a bunch of DSLRs and a BMCC. The BMCC has vastly superior image quality, but as the night goes on, it seems to have developed a dozen or more hot pixels that show up as white or coloured dots and are quite noticeable on a black background.

Any ideas on how to make them less noticeable? Thanks in advance guys! 









































































































































































 So we've been using sennheiser in ear monitors for the last 12 months or so, with the stock earbuds, and recently I had a chance to use the same radio pack and microphones with a set of shure earbuds. I didn't see what model they were, but they absolutely blew me away, the sound was just crystal. Full and clear. 

So as I hunt around for earbud options, I thought I'd consult the pros here - have you guys found nirvana in a stage earphone? What should I check out?

 




 An update to the thread I posted last week...

So today my band and I taped our Starking appearance. We sang with Girl's Day - at least, three of them, Minah must have known I'm dangerous and stayed away.

I never realized just how young those girls are - but they were totally charming, super professional and heaps of fun. Then we did a couple of songs with Brown Eyed Girls, who came across as... Sort of grumpy.

I don't know how our singing went, but we had an awesome time with the new hosts, Boom and Teuk (ex super junior) and it was a pretty damn hilarious day all up, once all the waiting around was out of the way. They seemed to think we kicked some butt, so who knows, it could lead us somewhere. :)

it's going to air in late November, I'll get a copy when I can and stick it on YouTube - but yeah, I thought you guys would appreciate what a crazy day I just had! :D 









 I sing with an Australian a cappella group, we're in Korea quite regularly, this will be our third visit this year. One of the things we love to incorporate in our show is bad imitations of k-pop songs, it's pretty funny since we're all guys.

Long story short, some TV producers saw us singing Twinkle Twinkle earlier this year and they've invited us to do a broadcast later this week.... And it seems like they're bringing Girl's Day in for the show as well. I have no idea what's going to happen, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be hilarious. :)

Wish us luck! 





































































 I've got a nice frontpage setup, but I like to see what's going on in the rest of the reddit world as well. Seeing as there's a few specific subreddits that are super popular but totally not of interest to me, is there any way to filter them out? 




 I've manually created a vignette effect (I know, I know) that I want to use on a dozen or so clips. I'm just dipping my toe into after effects, is it easy to save that adjustment layer and copy it across to the other clips, or am I missing the point? :) 




 I'm starting to shout at my telly now, having just come through the Vice section. The evidence is so weak and the questions so vague at this point of the game that you're more or less just guessing in interrogations. Even when you get questions right, you seem to get bugger-all in return. And it doesn't matter if you stuff every question up, the game goes on. It's like a movie in which you twiddle a thumbstick every now and then to get to the next scene.

The action is pretty ordinary and formulaic, the driving is both boring and unnecessary, the city has little in it that makes me want to explore further, the main character is a bit of a prat... Sure, the stories are great and the character animations fantastic - but the gameplay is so fucking irritating that I'd probably be happier if I left it alone and never finished it.

Next to Red Dead Redemption, this feels like a gimmicky vehicle for the awesome animation work of Team Bondi, a half way step towards future games that might put the technology to better use. But that might just be me. 














 I want to expand my abilities... Can you guys throw out some quick tips on how to make a project more visually interesting with the footage you've got? If you can point to any example videos I'd love to see them.  




 Sorry guys, beginner's question here: I'm working on a 25fps sequence using footage from 2 cameras - a Sony HDV camera and a Canon 7D. We've shot interviews and the like from 2 angles and want to be able to cut back and forth between vision from the two cameras - but it seems they shoot in slightly different frame rates.

If I create a 25fps sequence and just drop in the 23.975fps footage, does Premiere CS5 just sort frame rate issues out? Or do I need to process it somewhere else? Oh, and sorry if this is a stupid question! 









 Hey guys - just a quickie. I've been using prores transcoding in FCP, which does a great job of making 7D footage editable. Now I have to do a reasonably large project in CS5 - should I edit the 7D footage straight, or transcode it to something?

If I need to transcode it, can I do it using the Apple Compressor, or does Adobe have its own tool that works better? What format works best?

Cheers in advance! 














 Hey guys - thanks for the inspiration. I'm on day 2 of keto plus a few weeks into Starting Strength; I'm gonna be a total posterboy for reddit body transformation... heh heh. 

I'm struggling already though... The thought of greasy food for dinner again is making me a bit nauseous, plus I feel headachy and drained. Just checking in to make sure this is normal... Is it? 
























 Hi guys - and thanks for giving me the inspiration to get back to training after more than 10 years on my arse.

I went in and did my first squats, deads and press workout today, and ended up in a conversation with the guy running the place. I've got bad knees as a result of way too much basketball when I was younger, and I'm now carrying a lot of weight (~125kg) - getting my legs back in shape to support dodgy knees is the main reason SS appealed to me. I've been doing bodyweight broomstick squats at home for the last month or so.

The gym guy, an old fella who seems experienced in free weight training, is telling me I shouldn't jump straight into 5-rep heavy lifting in search of strength. That since I haven't been in a gym for 10 years I should spend at least a month doing low weights for 20-30 reps on things like leg extensions, unweighted or low weight bar squats and the like, in order to prepare my tendons and ligaments for the stress, that if not, I'm risking a blowout at the squat rack with severe consequences.

This seems to go against what Rippetoe says in SS - that the squat is not only the perfect conditioner of connective tissue, but that done properly, it shouldn't be dangerous. The way I read it, he seems to be saying learn the right forms and get straight into it. I'm confused... Help! 












































 So we're replacing a band member, and have found one strong candidate who seems to have a lot of the attributes we need - a rare combination. But his groove is non-existant - too much time in the classical world I think.

I've got time to spend with him if we decide he's our man, but I wonder what you guys' experiences are. Is groove innate or can it be trained? Will I be pushing shit uphill if I try to train him? And how would you go about it? Mixtapes? Metronomes? One-on-one sessions? 

Any ideas? 




















































































 Thought I'd bring this one up because it always tends to flush out a bunch of other wonderfully horrific stories about how other dudes lost THEIR knackers. 

SO:

I was lucky, because my nut started to hurt. In most cases, testicular cancer is absolutely painless, which lets it grow and spread to the lymph nodes, lungs and eventually the brain (which is the state it got to before Lance Armstrong did anything about it).

In my case, it was caught early because I'm a rabid motorcyclist and was learning to pull wheelies. When you're learning wheelies, you tend to smack the bike down and bash yourself in the nads a lot. The best guess of the docs is that weeks of testicular trauma due to mousetrapped wheelies had caused a minor bleed into a tumour that was growing in ol' righty. The bleed caused it to swell until the nut was twice its normal size, it hurt like a thousand bastards and I got it diagnosed. So it could be said that wheelies may have saved my life. Honestly, officer.

Apparently most cases of testicular cancer are discovered by the missus, in the bath. Or so I'm told.

The rest of the process was fairly simple. They chop out the diseased bollock (though it's not a simple case of cut the ol' scrotum and pull it out, they actually go in from your stomach, below your navel and off to the side, go figure), you go stash some wigglies at the sperm bank and then go for a short round of chemotherapy, which has a 50% chance of permanently sterilising you.

Chemo sucks, in my case it was just one IV bag of one chemical, carboplatin, which is so toxic that the nurse carries it in wearing elbow-length gloves. A nice touch. The treatment took 45 minutes, after which I had to go sing a gig. That was interesting. It left me with no appetite or energy for weeks, and for the next 3-4 years I felt kind of foggy in the head, as if I was thinking through cotton wool. I can only imagine things are worse for people who have to go through longer treatments - Armstrong is a good example, he had to have five or six, the poor bugger. With just one treatment, I didn't even lose any hair.

Anyway, I didn't find the process overly scary, and apart from the annoying effects of chemo, I can honestly say that one nut works just as well as two (the missus tested it out just hours after surgery). Looks a bit odd, mind you, but then the frank 'n' beans have never struck me as particularly pleasing to look at, even in the best of times.

So hopefully if there's anyone out there that's just copped a nasty shock, found a lump or had a diagnosis, I can reassure you a bit. There's plenty of blog posts, articles and whatnot on the net where fellas make a big deal out of losing one ball, what it means to their manhood, and generally make it sound very scary. It doesn't have to be, though, and your life will go on just fine. The guy at [www.mybollox.com](www.mybollox.com) has a pretty healthy attitude about it all (and incidentally, the same doctor as I had).

As for the rest of you, if this post gets you to fondle your nuts or the nuts of somebody you care about, I'd consider that a win for everyone. Even if you don't find anything.

Fire away! 







































 I'll be doing up a full review in time, perhaps a video review too - but since this is such a breakthrough bike, arguably one of the two most fascinating superbikes of 2010 alongside the S1000R, I thought you motoreddit folk might have some questions. So if you do, ask away! 


































 I know what you want to say, and I know you're struggling to get it out, and I know YOU know I know. What I don't know is whether it's ruder for me to finish the sentence for you so we can move on, or to wait for you to finish and let you hang out there because I don't want to talk over you... 

So, uh, whaddya reckon, should I finish your sentences? 

















































 He might come in very handy as an Oden remedy.  




 FUCK THESE FUCKING CUNTS
 




 11 in the morning here in Melbourne, Australia. Dunno what you're all complaining about. :P
 




 Heeheehee 




 Sure, but it was IMPLIED. 




 Highlights: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsvBg9UQXus

You know, looking back on it, there were some great dunks but the competition itself has always been a joke. Nique's two handed windmill with his head over the rim scores 45 and Jordan gets a 50 for the same dunk he did in the semi round? C'mooonnnn. As a kid this was a really huge thing, but looking at it now, I kind of understand why the name players wouldn't bother with it. 









 I'll give YOU two wet balls in a minute. 









 Vince, MJ and Dominique Wilkins were absolute highlight factories, but there's no argument in my mind that Carter is the best dunker that's ever played in the NBA. 




 'Knoaf mate 




 But you have the athletic trainer of the year up there!  




 I think this serves an important purpose.  




 Dummies would be spat. 




 Gold is a nice way of spreading a bit of joy while supporting the website. Best thing to do is to pay it forward... Here ya go! :P 




 http://assets.dogtime.com/asset/image/4f967276eadf725ead000500/column_dog-picture-photo-puppy-growl.jpg 




 I feel like the Hawks should take this one as a moral victory. Durant made a huge shot at the end, but it was immediately preceded by a bitch-ass push off no call and a rip-through. I reckon we should be able to expect more from KD.

I wanted OKC to win, but... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avr7enrZuJQ

Hawks' offense made a fool of the Thunder through the first 3 quarters, every basket seemed like an easy one, where the Thunder were struggling to get shots off and making some really tough looks. GG Hawks. 




 Blockrates?!? Hahaha!
 




 Plenty of post but it's also a great lens, I bet it's the 135 f/2 L.  




 I thought the same thing, but we did a cheap-arse wedding and it turned out to be one of the best days of my life.  




 For me, yeah. But that's because my camera only had one good autofocus point in the center there and I don't trust the others.  




 I think it might also help to use a fisheye lens or another ultra wide, then you can exaggerate the painted flowers and give the sense of being right behind the canvas instead of looking from a few feet away.  




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z201YXJX3c0 




 It's called a go360. Here's me being a dickhead reviewing one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z201YXJX3c0 




 Doesn't show a lot of class going off for 70 on one of the worst teams in history in a total blowout. Then again, there was bugger-all else interesting about that game. 




 I dunno. He's not real flash at making in-game adjustments, but he's astonishing in between playoff games at taking away an advantage. 




 Well woop de doo. 




 "War is bad. It makes me sad."

- Melo's sole contribution to his University history class. 




 DMC stood on Paul's foot as he was trying to turn and run. 




 Everybody just wants somebody to beat the fucking heat.  




 Slim reapist? 









 He missed that free throw just to fuck with you. 




 It just occurred to me to check what the record for consecutive 30-point games was... Yyyyyeah, Wilt with sixty-fuckin'-five. Dayumn. 




 Amazing figures, considering how shittily he started the 4th quarter.  




 To me it doesn't look like it's quite stopped rising. 




 Good games for their time, but I think the ship has sailed. 




 Really? I think he comes across as a thoughtful, warm, stand-up guy. 




 Then again, I've heard it said that if you get a hold of somebody's chinpiece you can 'make their head go wherever you want it to. ' 




 Aussie here - I never picked a team, I just like keeping an eye on the league as a whole and catching as many games as I can from the teams that are doing awesome stuff at any given time. 




 I think it's actually a positive, kinda like Pop making sure the Heat don't get a look at the full squad before crunch time. 




 Since the Heat beat OKC in the finals, they always seem to be in the Thunder's heads. Maybe this is the year they turn that #2 self-perception on its head. 




 Also not to mention he scored a career high on Iguodala, one of the best wing defenders in the game. 




 On the other hand, as well as KD is playing, the OKC offense has long periods of total suckage. No movement, no plan, just give it to the Reaper and hope he can do something cool. I wouldn't be surprised if the Spurs take it comfortably, even if Kawhi ends up with a KD scrotum-print on his eye sockets. 




 That's not language. Get with the times! 




 What about making video players marginally less stupid so they can play the video vertically?  




 His hook shots have been money lately. 




 I think you're right, he's got one of the biggest verticals I've ever seen and he has a lot of style and flair. Although Blake and DeAndre occasionally unleash those giant destructo-dunks that are even more exciting. What Blake did to Pau, foul or not, was two of the best dunks I ever saw. 




 Ah righto. 




 Because LeBron denies that he's slacking off, maybe he's just running low on energy. 




 Why would he be angry at Deng? It's not like he had a say in the matter.  




 I like your new adjective there. PG got all dunkier-than-thou on the Clips. 




 Heh heh yeah been there - missus not impressed. But that only happens once or twice, after that the adage holds! 




 Looks like a decent rider stuffing around to me. No such thing as an unintentional wheelie. 




 Pacers forgot how to miss... 




 This should be a ripper game. I'm thinking pacers by 10 though. 




 But who the fuck understands the theory behind a pop hit? It doesn't matter. 




 Kids can emotionally connect with music without intellectually understanding it. Try that with your Dostoyevski.  




 Funny that so many cartoons use classical soundtracks. How can we expect kids to understand that?  




 Whaaaaaat? 




 ...scrogged.  




 It looks a bit... Fallen off of. I think you've just munted your resale value - and let's face it, this is a learner bike, you're gonna want to sell it within a couple of years. 




 Awwwwww! That's sweet! 




 YO MOMMA ATE THEM
 




 No way - no two guys move the same way in the air. Look at MJ's dunk contest efforts, there was nothing formulaic about those yet they just looked so damn good in slo-mo. 




 No way, he was saying in the lead-up to the contest that he had 4 dunks prepared that nobody had ever seen before. It wasn't improvised. 




 Nature's *other* dental floss. 




 It was always dogmatix here in Australia when I was a kid.  




 'Tis a bag of wank, sir! 'Tis not for riding. 




 Well you sure told them. 




 Nothing out of the ordinary. 




 Man, I LOVE the countryside, I spend hours just jumping dirt bikes in the mountains. Go play GTAIV if you want to be stuck in a big, grotty city. 




 YOU'RE A CUNT. 

Oh, sorry, are we starting yet?  




 I read somewhere that the uncle had been involved in price collusion with the Chinese over some NK business deals too... 




 You start with the body - tall, lean, strong. Unbelievable athleticism, the league had never really seen anybody who could just hang in the air so long. Watch the old game tapes, Jordan would elevate for a shot, wait for the defenders to drop out of the air, then shoot right over the top, have a coffee and come down. His hands were gigantic too, he could palm the ball at will, giving him amazing control on the dribble, or in the air, or grabbing steals. And his speed was absolutely stunning, in the open court he had an extra gear that nobody could keep up with. 90% of the time he looked like a coiled spring, running conservatively, but then he'd explode and it was amazing to watch.

Then there was the offensive skills - his touch was absolutely ridiculous, nobody has ever come close. He'd make layups the league has still never seen again, changing his mind two or three times in the air and kissing it in with a little spin off the backboard. His post game was just unreal to watch, that turnaround fadeaway was so deadly. He was an absolutely electric scorer, if the ball was in MJ's hands something amazing could happen at any second. Excellent vision, too, finding teammates or punishing a sloppy double - and if he got a sniff of the rim, he'd rise up and posterize ANYBODY in his way.

You could talk about defense - that sprung from his ridiculous motor. The guy was just ON all the time, an absolute energy factory and there were rumours he'd party all night and turn up and still demolish you. He was a constant threat on defense, not just on his own man, but a demon in the passing lanes for steals and most games he'd have one or two out-of-nowhere flying blocks as well. 

The competitive spirit and iron will just burned in him, he was the ultimate win-at-all-costs psychopath, to the point where it almost looks like it's ruining his life after basketball. He took *everything* personally, in fact if there was the tiniest reason to get pissed off with somebody, he'd make it his mission to destroy and humiliate them, and more often than not, these were his best games. Having said that, he never took a game off. You see LeBron and the heat coasting during the regular season - that would never happen on a Bulls squad, they just had a fire inside. 72 wins in one regular season is evidence of that.

And on top of all this and his many other gifts, he was also the most stylish player ever to take the court. Everything he did just looked so damn beautiful and in control. He was loose and fluid, but incredibly strong and athletic at the same time. If you played ball in the 80s and 90s, you'd see so much of MJ's style in the other kids - tongues out, scoop reverse layups, jumpman leg splits, people just wanted to be him. It sure didn't hurt that his Nike PR team concealed what a knob he was from the public so impeccably. 

So yeah - perfect storm. Outstanding physical gifts, unparalleled drive to improve and win, smart, skilled, creative, unstoppable and more marketable than pretty much anything the world has seen since. 




 Ah, you never know. Some people respond to Kobe's glaring style of motivation, others would absolutely hate it. 




 Yeah good call. The old one had much nicer colour and contrast than my 24-105, but it was just useless indoors. Blew me away how blurry every shot was. 




 Canon 5D3 lets you do it in-camera, hence a rash of similar pictures when that camera launched.
 




 Canon 24-70 f/2.8 - I haven't tried the new one, but I had the old one for a year and hated it. Lack of IS really killed it in the low light situations I expected it to shine in. 




 Canon 135mm f/2L. 




 Perhaps the balls dropped? 




 There's a difference between really bad and just completely destroyed by injuries. Bad luck has played a big part, the team was performing above expectations before everyone got carted away in the meat wagon.

 




 He should be there for sure, he's an absolute highlight machine. 




 Plus, y'know, proximity of teeth to balls.  




 Wow. 

If you were a boy scout I'd hand you an advanced turd polishing badge. That is very impressive.  




 Right on, it's no kind of path to peace or happiness. After all, what's the ultimate goal? 




 Forget variable NDs, they're garbage. 




 He acts like a child throwing a tanty. 




 Jesus, what a loser. 




 What's this from? 




 Haha I wrote about this a couple years ago, they're fasscinating! Couple of amazing videos of them at work too: http://www.gizmag.com/nuclear-icebreakers-double-acting-ships-azipods/20903/ 




 I think it's more than that. I think the US relies on massive military spending for such a huge chunk of its economy that it's become addicted to war. The country has deliberately stayed in constant conflict since WW2. Drop that spending and the country would be thrown back into depression.  




 *shudder*

Dude think of it this way: a new chain and sprockets makes the motor and gearbox feel amazing. I change my chains a bit more often than is strictly necessary just 'coz I love the feel of a fresh set.  




 You. You are a bad person.  




 I agree on both those counts, but he also comes off as a total knob end. 




 Yeah, now that you mention it. Aussie here and I reckon Bogut looks like a proper bastard.  




 Not only the initial impact, but the two jagged ends of each bone snagging and pinching all the muscle and tendon as the foot dangles freely. Ugh.  




 "Whoooo, a little more choke and that would've started! " 




 "Better an empty flat than a bad tenant..." 




 I'm not sure that's a bad thing. Aussie drinking culture is pretty gross. Source: ex-piskarn.  




 Unwatchable. 




 It sure seems like every couple of days another great player goes down. Anybody keeping a list? Is there any way to compare this season to others in terms of which seasons have been most impacted by high profile player injuries?
