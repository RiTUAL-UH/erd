 What's the funniest joke you know? 




 Hey guys, we're doing a charity today called Replay for Life!  All money donated goes straight to Relay for Life, an organization helping to fight cancer.  We're live streaming our games today, so feel free to check it out, spread the word, and donate, via www.replayforlife.org! 




 Hello Gabe, Wolpaw, EJ, Ido, and Coomer!  Glad to have you guys here!

I was wondering if you had any tips for wannabe game developers who only have coding experience.  While I can code a game fairly well, I don't know many people who can do the artwork, nor do I know many people who can do the music/sounds, and while I want to get into the industry, it's been a long struggle.  What tips would you have for either meeting people who can do so, or finding ways around it (preferably under a college-student budget)?

On another note, any internships available at Valve, and if so, could I have one? XD 














 I've gotta say, Github made their generator very creative lol 




 Hey guys, a quick compo idea I posted a few days ago.  If this is not the right subreddit please just let me know (not on here too often still), otherwise enjoy!

The name of this minicompo is The Github Name Game.  When you create a repository on Github, it generates a random project name as a suggestion.  The idea with this is to create an entire project based around whatever name you get (for example: I got duck-batman XD).  If you're interested, post the entry on my blog post below.  I'll try to keep an eye on this thread (or elsewhere if it get's moved).  No prizes or anything for this as of yet, but even if there are none, it's still a good resume booster I'd say!

 From what I've seen mostly. The only limitation is the size of the room, which would get better with tech (going to be using the new alpha Kinect with it soon since that can see further).  




 The reason I ask this is because most definitions of it define it as simply a room you can interact within (usually with holograms, though other demos use similar tech as this) and also label themselves as holodecks, so if there's some part I missed, do feel free to say.  




 Maybe I'm missing something then, what exactly do you qualify as a holodeck? 









 Essentially the idea would be to create a penetration testing group (hacking team) and follow them around with a camera on whatever jobs they get for companies.  I did a really in-depth description about this on my blog, so feel free to read about it more in depth here: http://gemisis.blogspot.com/2014/04/hack-it-tv-show-idea.html

This was just one of the crazy ideas I dreamt up while attempting to sleep one night (Why must the mind do this??? XD) 




 Being able to do a ton of them in bulk with a cup was what I was pointing out.  It'll let you make a dozen of them without having to wait for them to all cool individually. 














 I honestly don't really think any current AAA developers will take advantage of VR best.  I think we may see new AAA developers popup as a result of VR honestly, assuming that VR takes off this time around.
