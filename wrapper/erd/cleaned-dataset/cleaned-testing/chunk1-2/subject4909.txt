 What exactly happens ?  




 Either that or Britain's most pressing crisis is an epidemic of loss of eyesight. Or an inability to count. 




 Yes, it can indeed be addictive. It has its uses from my experience. 




 Well perhaps. The problem is that *all* economic forecasts from the IMF or otherwise have a very high error rate. 




 Hi. I'd just like to thank you for the previous reference (Kliman) that you sent me in response to a post 4 days ago on r/socialism concerning an article about the 'neighbourhood effects' of low wages. I haven't had time to read it all yet, but a brief scan makes me sceptical about their idea. It contradicts too much of the economic data available. In any case I will read it sometime soon even though I am sceptical. I'm not afraid of contrary views. What I appreciate is your efforts to actually present a substantive argument. That can be quite rare on the internet.

Take care,

Burt 




 Yes indeed. It does bring up a memory of a book I read a long time ago. Its title was 'How to Lie With Statistics'. 




 Which part ? It covers a lot of ground. 




 This post seems to have generated a bit of discussion, and I have expressed my opinion about its value below. All that I can add is that despite all the deficiencies pointed out, basically because of the purposes of the business unions and the fact it doesn't result in some huge and immediate eruption of working class self-organization, it is still something very valuable, praiseworthy and worth participating in. Massive changes in consciousness and organization don't happen suddenly. They are *always* prepared by a slow gradual back and forth of working for changes that may seem miniscule from a purist perspective. There is no other way. Yes, it is something to cheer. I'll give an analogy.

It's a football game, and you team has just made a 30 yard punt return. Do you grumble that it should have been 50, 60 yards or a TD ? Do you loudly complain about the intelligence of the quarterback or the running speed of the punt returner. Yes, the coach may be an asshole and incompetent to boot. The team manager may be dipping into the treasury, and the QB may be taking bribes to throw games. All of these problems *can't* be solved immediately with any amount of denunciation. Remember, it's still *your* team, and 30 yards is still worth cheering about. 




 Some of these are really creative. I wonder who the artists were. There are tags on some but not all. 




 No, I don't think there is any English translation yet. The book was only released 3 days ago in Paris. Interestingly enough I can't even find the name of the French publisher. I wouldn't be surprised if they were keeping that secret for obvious reasons. So I can't even tell you how to order the French version. A French magazine 'L'Obs' has published excerpts in the last few days - in French of course. 




 They'd probably find a way to have a monopoly on them.  




 The article was published in 2008 in 'Applied Animal Behavior Science' **113** 150-165. This journal is moving towards an open access policy, but at the time it wasn't so. It's there but behind a paywall I'm afraid. 




 I guess it depends on what year you take as a baseline. I think the report refers to the baseline as the last year. 




 Yes, I see what you mean.  




 I couldn't find the ad when I looked again, but that's not unexpected. The Daily Kos makes its money via ad revenue rather than subscriptions, and the ads 'rotate'. When I looked I could check out some sort of high end jacket, remove my brown spots, become beautiful again and have my criminal record erased and so on and so on and so on. Given the political views of the Daily Kos I wouldn't be amazed for them to run a Clinton ad. There are probably some politicians that they'd balk at, but those wouldn't try to advertise there anyways (except maybe Rand Paul).

No doubt Clinton has a whole necropolis of skeletons in her closet - besides being a crook - and some of the Democratic Party persuasion might be fully aware of that. A lot of people, however, are loyalists of one party or another under the 'lesser evil' mantra. It's not my view, but it is an arguable point of view. 




 More than 2,000 actually. He lived in the same 'axial age' that produced western philosophers such as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle and the Buddha in India. 




 My urban experience has been very much with racoons and deer. While I was growing up in the country I would occasionally spot wolves from a distance. I had 'close up' experience later in life when I nursed the loser in a wolf fight back to health. The first time in both the wolf and I were *very* cautious. Two months later he would jump for joy on seeing me. I used to bring people in to watch (behind two sets of bars) while I would raise his lips and 'twang' his fangs.

You know I've never been able to spot a mountain lion either in the country or in the city where they occasionally wander in. I've even been unrealistic enough to try and track them. To say the least this didn't go far. Bears sometimes wander into other cities, but I have a neurosis about them. No attempts to track them even though it's easier. As for the birds I'm not a great observer, but there are city falcons where I live, and I sometimes see them. Never saw them catching anything however. Eagles *very* occasionally and never in the city.

Another story. I hate crows and love squirrels. I once watched as a crow swooped down and grabbed one of the squirrels I feed. Up into the air, very, very high and then...'drop'. Splat ! I used to run into racoons a lot, but a couple of years ago the city police went around shooting them all in the neighbourhood. They have still to repopulate. The racoons never gave me any problems even though I would sometimes mistake them for a 'very big cat' in the dark. Never went "kitty, kitty, kitty" and tried to touch them. All my fingers are still attached.

Sorry to load old stories on you. It brings back memories. 




 Actually I'm not a great fan either. There were much more attractive ancient Chinese philosophers. Still, it was a quip rather than a statement of belief. Viva Lao Tzu. 




 I can appreciate your scepticism, but to be all Chinese about it, "they laughed at Confucius too". 




 Probably so, and coupon clip to the end of their days. Never, however, underestimate the allure of greed and lust for power. These can override even the most obvious calculations of self-interest. 




 You are right about that when I think of it. The item I posted was, of course, gung ho on the concept and ignored the complications. 




 In the end, however, the 'smaller state' rhetoric of various sorts of conservatism rarely becomes reality when they gain power. The role of government and its expenditures continue to expand. It's just that cons spend the money on their own pet projects. 




 You're welcome. 




 Yes I see that. I was totally unaware of Lewy's work. He is **not** the demographer described in the UCLA press release. That man's name is 'Patrick Heuveline'. Lewy is mentioned in the Wikipedia article I cited, and, interestingly enough, he was the writer who produced the *lowest* estimate of deaths from American action in Southeast Asia as is referred to above. That seems to fit with the description of his work given above. The Armenian genocide did of course happen as did that of the Roma whatever the man may say. I presume that Turkish government money had a lot to do with his opinions in the Armenian case. 




 Yes, it is indeed partially a PR campaign, but the nature of what the SEIU and others have chosen for their campaign is such that it has obvious benefits from any success it may gain. Also, don't forget that it is bringing in new people who have enthusiasm that hasn't been dampened by decades of 'business as usual'. This is a great field that shouldn't be ignored. 




 Yes probably true, but examine the numbers given in paragraph 2 above. Once more take the highest number and subtract that from the lowest estimate for Cambodian deaths. It still leaves 90% of the corpses as the responsibility of the Kymer Rouge. 




 You're correct. I got my references scrambled. The 1.5 to 3.6 million is from 1954 to 1975. The 1965 date is from a book by Guenter Lewy where he makes an estimate of the deaths in the Indochinese wars of 1,313,000. There are other references in the Wikipedia article to the Indochinese wars and estimates of the deaths in Cambodia by US action. 




 I don't believe he has investigated that case. Others, however, have done so. There is a [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_war_casualties) that presents the various estimates of the *total casualties* of the wars in Southeast Asia. The references are all there if you care to look at the matter more fully. Most of them are internet accessible. The total human cost of the wars were estimated to be from 1.5 to 3.6 million from 1965 when the US first got involved after the defeat of France. This figure includes all military deaths on both 'sides' as well as civilian deaths in Vietnam North and South, Laos and Cambodia. It doesn't include the genocide committed by the Kymer Rouge.

As with *all* estimates of the toll of genocides the figures can only be approximate and the numbers vary. In any case the numbers killed by US bombing in Cambodia prior to the KR takeover range from 40,000 to 150,000. This is horrendous enough, but taking the *highest* estimate of direct US responsibility and comparing it to the *lowest* estimate of KR murders it is *at best* 1/10th of what the KR did to the Cambodian people.

The *total* loss of human life in American wars in Southeast Asia, including both military and civilian deaths, is in the same ballpark as that of the KR murders. In Cambodia itself it was very much smaller.

Here's an interesting side note about the leftist politics of the time. The left in developed countries generally made 'heroic efforts' to avoid saying the truth about the fact that the USA along with China gave at least diplomatic support to the KR (and perhaps more especially in the case of China) during the time of the genocide. It would really spoil the narrative. The exceptions were Moscow line communists and some anarchists. 

It really threw the 'left' into a fit when their previous heroes, the Vietnamese communists, invaded Kampuchia after what were insufferable provocations in my opinion including the slaughter of ethnic Vietnamese in Kampuchia. It was Vietnam that ended the genocide.

If you wish to blame the USA for anything blame it for being a mouthpiece of the KR regime at the United Nations. Isn't international politics wonderful ? 




 As to the original question it seems to me to be chicken and egg. Does reddit make you depressed or do people go to reddit *because* they are depressed. My observations tell me that 'anger' is a lot bigger problem than depression in terms of having a sensible exchange of views. 

I do a lot of posting on subs devoted to scientific matters, and the general level of aggression there is several quantum leaps below what you'll find on 'political' sites. No doubt people can get angry at anything, but the political sites have a vastly greater amount of sewage in them. 




 "Plumbing" ??? This definitely suggests something about (bull)shit. I wonder if the execs were fully cynically aware while making the decision. 




 Thanks. 




 Thanks. I'm a subscriber to Science so I can access them. The paper edition hasn't arrived yet. Like most Science articles, however, non-members of the AAAS have no access. Too bad. Open access is becoming more and more common, and hopefully it will someday be the norm. 




 Myself I'm not too sure. No doubt the manned missions are often undertaken more from reasons of national prestige rather than scientific value. I still, however, think they have made substantial contributions - the ISS at least if not the Moon missions. The ISS has also build a groundwork for the international cooperation that can help in other missions.

So, I partly agree with you but only partly. 




 It has been repeatedly demonstrated, there is no connection between vaccination and autism (overdiagnosed in my opinion). People search for news that fits their preconceptions. yes, your comparison is quite apt.  




 Thank you very much for your work. I had a quick look at the paper, and to my mind it is indeed well done. Some of the math is beyond me. I know what a 'Fourier transform' is for instance but damned if I could offer an intelligent opinion on its use. In any case I found what I was looking for. The authors use the 'Pearson correlation coefficient' to look at the correlation between their gravitational mass data from lensing and the actual location of galaxies. Fair enough. I know of the test, but I don't know about its limitations.

Still, like I said, this answers a lot of my questions and reservations.

Just as a side note I've looked at the ArXiv before and I often find myself blocked from complete access. Is it truly open access, and am I missing something in my computer skills ? 




 Yes, I guess that is sadly true. There are a lot of problems with regulatory agencies, and the problems aren't confined to the USA. 




 You know I had a look at the map, and from a brief glance it does show such a correlation. My problem is that such a qualitative measure (my eyes) doesn't fully convince me. I tried to get at the original paper to see the 'curve fitting' used, but the dreaded paywall fell down on me. I assume the authors did due diligence on this matter. 




 The full context of the gender wage gap is discussed in the article ie all the various causes. It is also discussed in numerous other items both academic and official. The sudden knee jerk of a *flood* of angry comments to an article like this suggests a few things as does their persistence. This is obviously a thing that has high emotional content to some redditers, an emotional content that the general population doesn't share.

Terms such as 'gender wage gap', 'gender pay gap' etc are the common terms used in *all* legitimate economic publications. Perhaps they "rant" as well. 

As to your claims I see very well how the minds of some work. They (including you) are annoyed and in fact threatened by a presentation of a fact that contradicts their emotional anger/fear. They can hardly deny the facts so they resort to picking out something in the report that happens to be in *all* the educated reports on the matter. In this case it is the multifactorial nature of the *real* and properly named 'gender pay gap'. They think they've made a 'discovery' that allows them to launch an attack. After the attack they will forget about the nuanced nature of the item in question and retreat back to the "there is no gender pay gap" incantation that is so emotionally satisfying.

Fine and good. You can't look at a subject in a rational, dispassionate, **adult** manner. You do know, of course, that people like you have a mirror image 'evil twin' that acts exactly the same except that they switch the angel/demon labels. If you wish to find the "militant feminists" who are "bashing men" you can wander over to a wealth of the SRS reddits where people act like you do except that they have different enemies in a childish 'wargame'.

Your charge of being 'disingenuous' would have to be levied against *all* the economic studies of this matter, things that I read but you don't. Your magical phrase for preventing thought and self justification only works in your mind as the actual literature shows -over and over and over and over.

In any case this conversation is now closed. I had a quick look at your posting history (you are welcome to look at mine), and it seems it doesn't take much to send you into a fury. Please go to the SRS subs and yell at them. You are the 'enemy' they need just as they are the enemy you need.

 International call for solidarity with the case of Nicols Neira




In order to describe heaven, it is not necessary to transport up there earthy materials. It is necessary to abandon earth, its materials, in order to embellish life with its ideal Isidore Ducasse.

 With anger in our hearts and a deep sense of injustice is that we remember Nicols David Neira lvarez, a 15 year old young man, whose early affinity with anarchist ideas led him to be bludgeoned by the Colombian riot police (ESMAD) to the point that the constant banging of his head against the pavement damaged his brain matter. This happened during the heavy handed repression against the anarchist block during the May Day demonstrations in Bogot, 2005. He would pass away on the 6 of March.

 10 years later, we do not want to be viewed as victims, we do not forget and we shall not forgive. Today we face the same repression; peace-talk is no good when femicides are a regular staple, peace communities are persecuted, trans-gendered people are assassinated, when displaced people die hungry in the cold of the street, when death-squads threaten and attack mercilessly any expression of dissent, just as they did before. When military trucks are overloaded with youngsters from all over the country, taken away to uncertain destinations, and when our comrades in jail linger in overcrowded dungeons that the system calls prisons.

 10 years later we are happy to state that we are members of an international community, which has not been segmented by the borders, by flags, not even by language. We have been one with Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, Iberia, the United States, Ecuador, Venezuela, Indonesia, Palestine, Kurdistan, Greece, Turkey, Italy, Australia, Byelorussia, Egypt, Mexico. Every time we have shown our solidarity, discussing in the open or privately problems of places that may be far away in the map but not from the heart, every time we have acted accordingly to our desire to destroy to rebuild, when we have supported not facts, but for ideas harbouring the passions of millions of people; for those brief moments, as brief as life itself is brief, we have been able to be the entire world, the entire galaxy.

 For all this we want to invite you all, wherever you are, to carry any action which you think is suited to honour solidarity with Nico on this 6 of May. We know that you have anger and a deep sense of injustice as well, so we will be very happy to know of different activities, where the yell of Long live Nico! is heard of in different languages, and in different accents.

 Here's the beginning of such a list made up of 'mainstream' news sources from outside the USA. I'll begin with ones that I am fairly familiar with and give a separate list of suggestions for ones I know less about later. The symbol '(E)' after an item means that the source has an online English language section. Most but not all do. Be aware that most of these sources have a two tier system, one free and one paid. Let's start in the Middle East. Begin in the middle ?

[Al Jazeera](http://www.aljazeera.com) (E) Fairly well known left leaning service originally in Arabic. Best mainstream source for news from the Islamic world but also quite valuable in other areas.

[Le Monde](http://www.lemonde.fr) Most reputable paper in France. (E)nglish language edition available only by paid subscription. Centrist to moderate leftist outlook.

[AFP](http://www.afp.com) (E) French public news wire. Political views often very dependent on party in power.

[Agencia EFE](http://www.efe.com) (E) Largest Spanish language news service in Spain. Centrist to moderate right.

[El Pais](http://elpais.com) (E) Most popular newspaper in Spain. Conservative to moderate leftist.

[Telesur](http://telesurtv.net) (E) Spanish language service from Latin America. Centrist to leftist. Main value is in stories overlooked in English language media.

[BBC](http://www.bbc.com) (E) The grandmother of international news. British service spanning povs from conservative to leftist. World coverage makes it a very valuable source.

[The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com) (E) Left leaning, often quite visibly so, British newspaper. The grandmother of leftist sources in the anglosphere. 

[The Economist](http://theeconomist.com) (E) 'Intelligent conservative' or 'liberal' (in a non-American sense) business magazine with extensive coverage of non-economic matters as well. High quality and not ideologically rigid.

[Granma International](http://www.granma.cu) (E) Official Cuban government newswire. Very rigid ideologically but occasionally useful for matters ignored in the American media.

[CBC](www.cbc.ca) (E) Canadian public broadcaster. Moderate conservative to social democratic pov. Much higher quality than usual American sources.

[The Globe and Mail](http://theglobeandmail.com) (E) . Canadian 'national newspaper. Moderate conservative to leftist pov. 

[Xinhua](http://www.xinhuanet.com) (E) Official Chinese state news service. Often surprising for content you wouldn't expect from official sources.

[Global Times](http://www.globaltimes.cn) (E) Officially 'approved' news from China. Once more often surprising in content. Less ideologically rigid than Xinhua.

That's about it for sources that I am familiar with. Next installment will be other suggested mass media sources that I am less familiar with. Following that will be anarchist and leftist sources. 




 Of course it has to do with a pun on 'leftism'. It was right in the title as in 'off topic'. A pun for sure, not a knee slapping, gut bursting rolling on the floor howler of a joke. You know that explaining any joke kills the joke altogether. Now that you've killed the poor bugger I expect you to clean the mess off the floor. 

Not every post can be of world shaking importance or deep profundity.  




 The United States Census where the 78% number comes from are not really concerned about the 'interest' of 'most men' because they know that *most men and women will not have an emotional reaction to their findings*. *Most* meaning well over 90%. Please write letters of complaint to the US Census, the US Department of Commerce, and  the International Labor Organization (who put the US gap at 64%) and tell them how they should abandon economics in favor of somebody's emotions. The wage gap is an obvious and totally well established fact of economics. You may try to explain it away, but you shouldn't try to deny its reality. 




 Yes, unions have fought hard over the course of decades for 'equal pay for work of equal value', and progress certainly has been made. There is, however, evidence that even 'at the top' that women make less. The gap is narrower the higher you go. In my opinion the great majority of efforts should be concentrated at the lower end of the wage scale. The 78% figure is from the US Census. UN Human Development reports put it at 82% in the USA and 84% worldwide ie the USA is behind the world in terms of pay equity. The ILO, on the other hand, puts the gap at an astounding 64%. The reason for the difference is that the ILO includes part time workers while the Census only measures those with full time employment. The USA is dramatically behind the rest of the world in terms of pay equity for part time workers. 




 Glad to meet you. I have recently started a new subreddit r/worldanarchism which will hopefully be devoted to *international* ie non_American anarchist news. Please feel free to post anything you might feel relevant at that site. It would be appreciated. 




 I see you know a lot more about this forum than I do. I wasn't aware that it was *routinely* patrolled by a mass of very angry, very resentful people who have come to place their own personal problems, bad divorce or whatever, onto an abstraction called 'feminism'. It's actually quite sad.

The last time I went through references about the magnitude of the wage gap I think it was either the World Bank or the IMF figures that I found most convincing. I gave a short list of national and international agencies that measure the supposedly imaginary gap in a reply to another post.

The information is all there for people to look at. The trouble is that some people just won't look at it at all. Reality is less important than their need to assign blame. They certainly have a hell of a lot more emotion at stake than I do, and they escalate to anger very easily. Too bad. 




 Ahem !!! The 78% figure quoted is from the US Census. The estimate vary. The UN Development programme narrows the gap to 82% (US figures, the US lags behind the global average of 84%. On the other hand the International Labor Organization puts the gap at 64%. I'm sure the US Census would appreciate hearing from you on how wrong they are. It could be a matter of national importance. 




 Actually not at all. I remembered that there are other indexes compiled annually such as the Human Development Index. So I went to look. In the United Nations Development Programme website there is the Gender Inequality Index under the Human Development Reports. See http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/table-4-gender-inequality-index . The UN's table is **exactly** the sort of thing I was speculating about. It leaves out some the factors I mentioned and includes others that I missed. It's the old **what exists is possible no matter what theory says it isn't**. I've never looked at this particular report before, but its existence says that what I suggested is not just 'possible' but is done on a routine basis. 




 Wow. Thanks for the photo. 




 Ah, the faith that moves mountains. Here's a short list of some agencies that regularly track and report on the magnitude of the 'gender pay gap': the US Census, the International Labor Organization, the United Nations Development Program, the World Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the International Monetary Fund, the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee, the European Commission (technical advisers to the EU), the US Department of Commerce. The list could be expanded into *many* dozens of items, all of them produced by *real, credible, legitimate economists* who are hired for such work. The number of papers on the subject that appear in peer reviewed economics journals *each year* probably amounts to *thousands* if all languages are surveyed. 

The world knows, people who study these things in academic settings know. Business knows. Everyone knows...except for those that deliberately close their eyes for emotional reasons. Please present your stunning discovery that the scientific study of this issue is part of a 'man-hating plot' to the UN General Assembly. The nations of the World await your enlightenment.

All the information is available on the internet. Look it up. 




 Thanks for the info. 




 I said it would be difficult to make a single comparable number out of it, but I also said it wasn't impossible. Somewhat but not entirely subjective. The important point is that many of these metrics are covariant. 




 There's a good history of that available on the internet. See Randall Watters' article [her](http://freeminds.org/psych/propfail.htm) 




 I know. 'Dogan' isn't common slang anymore. It was when I was young. 




 Those are dates when the Watchtower Society predicted the second coming previously. Needless to say it didn't happen. 




 There are other metrics such age of marriage, inheritance rights, divorce laws, female genital mutilation, induced abortions of female fetuses, legal standing in civil suits, different civil laws in other matters, maternal mortality in childbirth, differential spending on gynecology and obstetrics as opposed to other medical fields, differences in status in religious services, etc. that are indicators. It would indeed be difficult to assign weights to the various factors, but I think it is not beyond the realm of possibility.  




 That's good to see. The only possible solution, other than partition amongst the surrounding countries - with the continued war that would mean - is a federal one. One can only hope the various groups can come to an acceptable agreement. The Swiss in times past proved it isn't impossible. 




 Are you referring to the dates the JWs predicted the end of the world or some dates on the video ? 




 No problem. No, not me. I'm an 'ex-Dogan'. I left the RC Church when I was 15, and never looked back. I'm an old fart now with the usual arthritis and reduced eyesight. I have, however, known ex-Jehovahs in my time, and it is indeed a particularly vicious religion. Also, can we say, 'weird'.  




 The original source of the video was [JWStruggle](http://www.youtube.com/user/JWStruggle) . The producer has several episodes of his trial/interrogation there. I'm afraid, however, that he doesn't seem to have any written summary as far as I can tell. Sorry I couldn't help you more. Have a quick look at the site. 




 It's a speculation, but a reasonable one when the other factors are excluded as the authors have done.. It certainly doesn't constitute 'proof', if any such proof one way or the other could be offered in a case like this. As I mentioned in a reply to another poster the UN tracks the gap year by year in various countries. Comparing the magnitude with reference to said countries' attitudes towards women would go a long was towards supporting or weakening the authors' explanation. 




 Yes, it seems to be downvoted. I've been in this argument before. I guess this sub is patrolled by the 'Resentment Patrol'. The gender gap is a well established fact, and every year the United Nations produces a report showing its magnitude in different countries. I think the link is quite well researched and properly balanced. At least somebody agrees with this. Thanks. 




 I don't believe so, but I'll look. 




 The one year that the NYC Anarchist Bookfair was most severely disrupted was 2012. I seem to recall a previous incident, but beginning in 2009 (the year when the Crimethink Conference you mention was disrupted) there have been several incidents in several cities. The Crimethink incident was carried out by a group who styled themselves 'Smack A White Boy'. See http://libcom.org/library/smack-a-white-boy-part-two-crimethink-eviction-2009 for a full account. Also various Crimethink statements at the time.

 Be aware that the "part 2" bit refers to a previous action earlier in that year. that the  'smacky' group carried out . On March 21, 2009 a commie front (Answer I believe) was having an antiwar march in Washington DC. The 'smackies' conceived the idea of trying to block the march. Their justification - are you ready ? - "to stand in solidarity with the people of Iraq and Palestine". I shit you not. How (trying to) blocking a commie front march in Washington 'helps' the people of Iraq and Palestine' I will leave up to your imagination. No doubt they lined up in their millions to sign a huge thank-you card. To my knowledge the commies simply walked around the small group and nothing spectacular happened. All went well, and the cherry trees blossomed as usual.

Back to Crimethink. The numbers of disrupters reported vary. One Crimethink statement said "about a half dozen". By the Smacky statement they claimed " 8 people", and once more according to them "from 7 different locations". The smackies wanted to make a video of their grand victory, but once more to my knowledge it came to nothing except for the following: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dHcRnOOXEA . It didn't go viral. The group dissolved into the chaotic air of USA anarchism, a tangled forest where many things have been lost forever. 

I have further references if you'd like. Now *here's the point that impressed me*. Eight people from *7 locations* ! How well did the disrupters know each other before - *if they knew each other at all beyond the world of email* ? Think about that for awhile.  




 The updates on the situation in Kurdistan are greatly appreciated. For myself I think that the Kurds in Syria and Turkey have a sufficiently laudable program (and efforts on the ground) to be supported, and their enemies are more than sufficiently evil to make up for any deficiencies the Kurdish polity might have. From what I see in the efforts of the European anarchist and syndicalist groups to offer what help they can I think they have made the right decision, that is support without having any illusions about the 'mixed' character of the part(ies !) in Kurdistan. It seems reasonable to me, and I certainly wouldn't try to sum up such a complex situation in a few sweeping generalizations. 

Personally I think the relationship the Spanish CGT has had with the EZLN for quite a few years is something of a model. They offer the support they can without engaging in long distance hero worship, reading things into the Zapatistas that aren't there or (worst of all as I have seen recently) using the Zapatistas as some sort of stick to beat other leftists over the head with for 'thinking unclean thoughts' (colonial maybe ?). On the other hand neither do they hold the EZLN to some artificial standard of purity that is never achieved in the real world.

All that being said I am still not over optimistic about the prospects for the Kurds. This isn't connected to any estimation of the virtues that they have or may not have. It's all about the place in the world and the time in history in which all this is happening. The Kurds are surrounded on all sides by enemies or potential enemies that have significant military strength, Turkey, Iran, Israel, Saudi Arabia, let alone all the weaker players, from Hezbollah, ISIS, other Kurdish factions, other Islamic factions, Syrian 'government', Iraqi 'government' and so on. Then there are the external players from the USA, EU, Russia.

The best that I could envision for the Kurds would be regional autonomy within the boundaries of present states with a greater or lesser amount of autonomy, probably less than that of a Swiss canton. To achieve this the Kurds will inevitably have to compromise, with each other as well as with the neighbours and distant interested parties. The present oil pipelines don't flow through Kurdish Syria, but they *do* flow through Kurdish areas of Turkey. Then there is Iran, a state not known for its willingness to compromise.

With all these shifting interests I also think that the best the Kurds can achieve outside of political autonomy is a more or less mixed economy. I hope that this economy would have a considerable communal and cooperative sector, but it simply won't be anything that Western leftists might dream of. In this case the pipers to be paid have a lot more hardware to use as argument.

Not that compromises, both political and economic, are worthless. I can hope that the political autonomy will be greater rather than lesser and similarly the economic compromises will be more 'to the left' than otherwise, but I certainly don't know and I think nobody can know where the ball will finally stop rolling.  




 I understand that they have set a few 'end times' before, and it didn't seem to depopulate them when the event never happened. Was the book 'When Prophecy Fails' written with them at least partially in mind ? 




 As a point of interest regarding the New York Anarchist Bookfair it was disrupted in past years (twice I believe) by a small contingent from 'Sergeant Fury and his PC Commandos'. I'll dig up the years involved. 




 A Twinkie a day keeps....you from forgetting where you left the Twinkies. 




 Interesting article. I liked the part where Blackwater has changed its name to 'Academi'. Maybe the mercs are being trained in post-modernist torture methods. One thing I don't remember...how were the murders brought to light and how was the government pressured to prosecute ? 




 It's working now. A good project even if the report is dated from early February. Still relevant. 




 Neat. Thanks. 




 A long and tedious explanation of the background to this post will follow soon. The premises at 33 rue des Vignoles in Paris house the offices of the anarchosyndicalist CNT-f, one of several anarchosyndicalist and revolutionary sysndicalist union confederations in France (the situation is even more complex than in Spain). The premises have been handed down over decades from Spanish exiles who were members of the Spanish CNT.

Spanish anarchist exiles played a prominent part in the Liberation of France. The 'Nueve' referred to above and below were the *first* Free French units to enter Paris on its Liberation, riding on tanks prominatly labeled with names such as 'Durruti' and 'Ascaso' Ever since 2011 there have been efforts on the part of the city of Paris to evict the occupants and a continued struggle to maintain the anarchist presence there.

In the meantime here's the English translation of the post.

                    

**33 Rue Des Vignoles Has a Future**

That is, in any case, what has been proclaimed by the presence of almost 500 people who came in to support  the Les Pas Sages des Vignoles association this Sunday, March 22.

The future of this place is first that the entities there, artists, Flamenco in France and the CNT, continue their activities now as they have for more than thirty years. This longevity proves that, despite differences, living and working together is possible. This day under the signs of 'Nueve' and 'antifasacist, republican and libertarian Spain' demonstrated it again.

All available premises were opened, members, students of Flamenco in France and CNT militants; the artists have worked hand in hand for the success of this day which concluded with a concert where the cultures of the Balkans, Gipsies and Flamenco were mixed.

In the afternoon the film '*La Nueve or the forgotten victory*' allowed the new Hispanic generations present, the neighbours of the Quarter and everyone to discover an often overlooked part of the history of the Liberation of Paris and also to support the claim brought by the Les Pas Sages de Vignoles association : to keep the present occupants and also devote a space dedicated to what made the history of 33.

These women and men who, from 1936 in Spain until the end of their days in Paris at 33, devoted their lives to liberty. They 'had' been revolutionaries in the Spanish war, members of the French Resistance, soldiers in the Free French Forces, survivors of the Mauthausen Camp, anti-Franco combatants, they were and still are living members of the CNT. A mini-exhibition in the halls gave life to this reality.

The Association Les Pas Sages des Vignoles will continue its efforts to keep the occupants and the opening of a space dedicated to antifascist and libertarian republican Spain at 33 Vignoles.

Finally, we thank all the people who came to support us who came as individuals or as members of the support committee.

For those who want to support us a petition can be signed online at https://www.change.org/p/mairie-de-paris-d%C3%A9fense-du-33-rue-des-vignoles-pour-que-vive-le-paris-populaire

 **Second Round: Second Libertarian Spring Day in Havana**

El Taller Libertario Alfredo Lpez, Locacin Cristo Salvador, y El Guardabosques

We are calling the Second Libertarian Spring Day in Havana to be held from May 29 to June 7, 2015. An open space with dynamic, anti-authoritarian and anti-capitalist process having forms of sociability and awareness based on horizontality, mutual learning and accountability.

We intend this day to be, as its name suggests, the evocation of a spring shoot of libertarian ideals whose roots, despite all historical adversity, always seek the right keys for a new breath, new routes for further exploration and possibilities for struggle and transformation.

The Conference will be structured along the following lines:

*Practices, resistance, autonomy, self-organization, solidarity, mutuality and networks

*Art and anti-authoritarian creation

*The new scene of interstate relations between Cuba and the United States

*Diversity: racial, sexual, gender, class, territorial, cultural and others

*Environmentalism, technology and action

We hope for your communication and thank you in advance for any help in promoting this event.

Havana, April 12, 2015

 OK I'll be kind. You've designed a 'nutbot' to supposedly identify nuts, libertarian spammers, and reply incoherently to them. The trouble is that the bot is either barely literate or it drinks on the job. What it does is tag mention of certain names or phrases and makes a silly comeback. What it *isn't* doing properly is to actually see what a post is all about. I went through its first 7 or 8 'hits', and two other posts were misidentified as 'libertarian' when they were the precise opposite. The bot needs a lot of work. Either that or taking the pledge. 




 Oh, a 'nutbot'. I guess it's fun for somebody who can't accomplish anything real in life.

 A nit well picked. Tolkien was indeed born RC. His mother converted to Catholicism, and she was determined that her children would be "well Churched". The term 'Anglo-Catholic' spans an expanse of views, all the way from fairly orthodox High Anglicans (Episcopalians in the US) whose theology differs from that of Roman Catholicism in significant ways, through shadings within the Anglican Communion, to independent Churches that are halfway between to the 'Anglican Rite' (a thing that Benedict XVI - fondly known as Pope Rottweiller to some - initiated and is still a matter of debate/negotiation) to full acceptance of the rules and rites of the Latin Rite. 

It's a complex matter, and to me it isn't surprising that Tolkien was 'upset' about Lewis only going 'half-way' from Tolkien's point of view. The shades of opinion in what is called 'Anglo-Catholicism' can seem opaque to an outsider. Very much as debates about Christology/The Trinity are to even the vast majority of Christians. Splits in leftist politics often look exactly as strange to non-leftists. Yes, I still think 'Anglo-Catholic' is a good term for Tolkien because he was part of that broad intellectual milieu. 

Other than that I am glad you pointed out that the man was indeed born Catholic. His religion was, to him, a much more important thing than any politics, and looking at his life from that point of view can really help dispel some of the misconceptions about his opinions. 




 Oh shit. I guess the item wasn't as reliable as I thought. 




 It's an interesting essay (almost a book), and it will take time to read and digest it all. Thanks for the contribution. 




 That's hardly surprising. Like his fellow fantasy writer C.S. Lewis Tolkien was an 'anglocatholic' with all that implied. All politics aside his loyalty to the Church meant that reports of the early atrocities during the Spanish Revolution impressed him greatly. There's more than one level of irony in this. First of all it was not the 'Communists' who engaged in anti-religious action but rather the anarchists. It was many months before the then miniscule PCE was able to exert any influence other than through their PSOE/PSUC allies. The second irony is that the atrocities were brought to an end in the space of about 2 months... by the anarchists themselves who brought the 'uncontrollable' elements under control. The reports of these events lasted longer than the events themselves. The final irony is that Tolkien' s economic views, basically Catholic 'Distributionism' were closer to anarchism than to any other more popular political trend. History can be, and is, messy. 




 It sets off my 'ick reflex'. While I'm not a big fan of chicken (I prefer beef) I haven't had great experiences with 'soy anything'. I guess it would depend upon process as you suggest. I gather you don't have extensive experience either. To be honest the sort of place I'd be most likely to meet such a thing would be in a vegan restaurant, and I avoid them like the plague. There are indeed vegetarian dishes that are appealing, but you pretty well have to go to an Indian restaurant to find them. 




 In a way yes. The researchers in the paper cited plucked hairs a certain distance from each other. What they tried to show was that this action led to the skin cells sensing the 'damage' and sending chemical signals to hair follicles to initiate hair growth. My analogy wasn't really proper. 'Shaving' is more like driving a lawnmower over your garden. Mowing a lawn certainly has effects on subsequent grass growth, though I think it is more a matter of altering the local environment of a grass shoot (more light) than of chemical communication. I might be wrong on this. Digging the whole thing up is like pulling out all the hairs in a given area of the scalp. Thus neither you nor I chose the proper example. 




 Thank you. 




 I never thought of that. Possibly yes. 




 Yes, but this is 'shaving' rather than selective 'plucking'. 




 Not really. From my reading of this the plucking was quite selective and well spaced. It was more like thinning the plants in a garden rather than ploughing the whole thing down. 




 The war widened as Coke came in on the American side, and Pepsi declared its allegiance to Russia. The small nation of Burger King was obliterated as the rival armies fought in out on their buns. China seized the opportunity and overran Siberia in a 'take-out' move. Russia struck back with its nuclear Subway fleet. In the end the combatants met for a peace conference at the Pizza Hut. When the armistice treat was finally signed the Taco Bells rang out across the world. 




 I wonder what the 'imitation chicken' is made of. 




 I've never heard of 'Lyfe Kitchens'. How is it doing ? 




 Thanks. 




 The votes are up and down. The article mentions one other Supreme Court ruling on a piece of Saskatchewan legislation that was taken as a sort of precedent in these cases. I think the answer to your question is that each new piece of legislation has to be challenged separately in court. 




 I guess I'll have to leave out the non-political magazines and sources as well as the ones that come to my door in physical space. I'll put in a list later today. 




 It's good to see that you are posting from both sides of this dispute. That is obviously what *should* be done, and it is the kind of openness that I'd like to see a lot more of. 




 Yes. 'Mostly' is not exactly a precise mathematical term. 




 It's been many years now, but I can remember the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline hearings. Many of the objections raised then would still be relevant. 




 The two pipeline proposals discussed in the article are both exclusively in Canadian territory. The article also mentions a non-pipeline proposal, a railroad that terminates in Valdez Alaska, but this isn't the major subject. 




 It sounds like a Riel idea. I've always wondered how Dumont could stand some of Louis' bizarre ideas. 




 There has to be a fly in the ointment somewhere in there. I got it. Melting permafrost becomes muskeg. Trying to build pipelines on muskeg is a futile task.  




 There certainly are a lot of problems. Can you imagine having to deal with a pipeline breakage around the time of spring melt ? 




 Yeah. I wonder how much (ap)peal they have. That's a bit too slippery to pin down.  




 It actually is amusing. :) 




 This had me going for awhile. There actually *is* an old inactive sub called r/banarchism. Plus one called r/The_Banarchist and a user of the same name. The little cult that controls meta relish the attention no matter how much they may say otherwise. 




 Sorry my mistake. I've made this goof before, but I forgot. 




 There's a lot of unknowns in trying to decide if these protests are a good idea or not. The worst case scenario, aside from a coup d'tat by the right, would be if Syriza fails in its game of chicken with the Troika but retains a broad base of support amongst the population. Guess who will be looked at as 'traitors' in that case.

There are a lot of things happening in Greece beyond the flashy news of riots. I'm thinking mainly of gradual expansion of the self-managed sector of the economy. Health care collectives/worker coops for instance have grown tremendously. This is hardly due to some thought-out plan by anarchists but rather because of the initiative of ordinary people.

Win or lose against the government the Greek anarchists show little sign of having any plans for either victory or defeat.

 




 Yes, they are used in some schools and wanted by some in many others. The first thing that comes to my mind is that such a measure automatically gives an advantage to teachers in schools that draw from a wealthier demographic in comparison to those teaching in schools where the pupils come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. It can happen that a teacher in a poorer school has done a remarkable job in generally inspiring his or her students, but if compared to his more privileged colleague in a wealthy school he or she may comes off in such a crude metric as 'inferior'. This can happen even if the teacher in a wealthy school is quite slack. 




 But I don't think it will give you infallibility. Yeah, I know...the title. 




 Or, from another point of view, be persuaded to give the pursuit of their own interests less importance than the elevation of a new ruling class to power, a class that would 'supposedly' look after their interests for them. Many socialists of Lenin's day saw 'What is to be Done' as not only a naked justification of tyranny but also as a blueprint for how not the workers but rather a class recruited from and directed by the intelligentsia would gain power using the workers as pawns.

The most cogent critic amongst Lenin's contemporaries was perhaps Jan Waclaw Machajski. To my knowledge his 'The Intellectual Worker' is still unavailable in English. His views are, however, well set forth in ['State Socialism'](http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/jan-waclaw-machajski-state-socialism). 




 Yes, that's my opinion as well. It leads to a great 'what to do'. 




 There's a long ideological argument behind that. Many have argued that the people who come to power in a Leninist revolution are generally not from the 'working class' (pretty well universally true) and that they create what is actually a new ruling class over and against the workers whom they claim to be representing. See Milovan Djilas' 'The New Class' amongst many other writings on the subject. If I were a Marxist I'd call this a 'contradiction' between the official ideology and the economic reality. 




 There is a good collection at the [Marxists.Org](http://www.marxists.org/subject/left-wing) . The site has links to archives of various authors who wrote in that tradition. There used to be a better collection, but it has gone bye-bye because it was on Geocities. 




 It might be a difficult point in law, but the general argument would be under the heading of "possession of goods obtained by crime". Suppose you are an ordinary citizen who (unknowingly of course) purchases an item from 'Sneaky Steven'. Further suppose that somehow said item was traced to your possession after Sneaky was caught. The law says, and it has justification, that the real owner is the victim of the theft, and the item has to be returned to him or her. Your loss of the purchase money to Sneaky is not considered to be an excuse for you to not return the item.

These sort of cases happen routinely. Cases involving money are less common, but the same principle should apply. Whether the Church is legally *forced* to return the money depends upon two things. One; their legal objections. Note carefully that they hired an attorney to present their case. The second influence is *willingness to prosecute*. Their apparent escape is probably very much due to the latter.

Once more, think of it as if you were the victim of a crime. Fraud is just as criminal as breaking and entering, and the victim should be able to recover the money lost to fraud, even if a third party now possesses it.

As to the fact that the money has already been spent - that would *not* absolve an individual in the same position as the Church. No doubt a deal would be worked out to repay in installments - just as the Church should. They do, after all, have an income. I doubt they are like the birds of the air and the flowers of the field.

Devil's advocates are always welcome. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints relies heavily on them. It's always good to ask questions.

Natural justice I believe it's called. 




 Well, if I was a contractor hired to install new marble tabletops in the Pastor's house I'd be as pleased as punch. 




 Freedom to keep stolen money is, of course, 'religious freedom', to some. Didn't the Rabbi in the Gospels have something to say about a golden god ? The only 'freedom' here is 'free' money obtained by the 'freedom' to steal. 




 It's a bit off the subject, but there's a Far Side cartoon about dogs and coprophagia. It goes like this:

*The panel has a 'kid dog' with tears streaming down his face standing in front of an older dog in a chair with a blanket over his lap (to give the impression of age).*

*The caption reads:  "I'll have you know that your grandfather ate shit, that his father ate shit and his father before him ate shit. There's nothing wrong with eating shit.... and don't ever let any cat tell you otherwise."*

Yep, it's an old dog habit. 




 No, but it may be a way to get campaign donations from energy companies. 




 It's an expanding field of research for sure. It's interesting that the work described here doesn't involve modification of the microbiome but rather modification of the body's response to it. Two sides of one coin. 




 I see no reason to forbid it. Cooking can remove any potential harm. Personally it triggers my 'ick reflex', but I don't think that things that I think are 'icky' should necessarily be banned. 




 Less 'unified' than a globe-spanning agricultural corporate feudalism by far. 




 It's a complicated relationship for sure. 




 Yep, I had a look and it's pretty wild. The Global Times is actually a government approved site. I read it because despite its status a lot of real news is published there. It's not like in the 'bad old days' when the Chinese press was basically a wall of rhetoric. 




 It's getting harder and harder for the US prison system to obtain the drugs they use. As the article mentions the AMA and the US anaesthetist association have passed resolutions saying it is unethical for their members to supply drugs for executions or for them to participate in them. The pharmaceutical companies themselves have refused to supply the drugs domestically, and they have also taken a position against supplying them from overseas. This is only partly from humanitarian motives. The companies have to be compliant with European law. The 'compounding' mentioned is when a pharmacist takes a chemical and modifies its form ie it is *not* the original drug. The originals are forbidden because of the laws and policies mentioned. Compounded products are only *theoretically* safe and effective. Almost none of the formulations used have ever been tested in a proper trial.

My prediction is that the US prison system will soon start ordering drugs from suppliers in India with all that implies. I'm sure it has been discussed in the proverbial 'back rooms'. The speed bump would be that it would be hard to make a profit with the relatively small amounts that would be ordered, and hence the deal wouldn't be attractive to Indian manufacturers. They presently make good money with antibiotics, but unfortunately not *all* manufacturers in that country have anything like quality control. 




 That might be the most democratic solution. 




 The IWA-AIT *was* present in the form of the Spanish CNT. There is a report on the event on their website. I just haven't got around to translating it yet. The meeting, however, was more of an informal gathering rather than one of organizations. 




 There are more problems with Stanchev's article than just a confusion between anarchists and left communists, but I'll deal with those elsewhere. For now I'll merely add to what you have said.

Saying that the 'anarchist milieu' is "slightly" larger than the left-com one is true understatement. Left communism had its glory days following 1968, and it was incapable of finding any particular field of action that might turn it from an intellectual hobby into a real political force. In other words it missed the bus, and said bus won't be coming by again. 

The ICC, for instance, is to all aspects virtually invisible, and it would be impossible to tell if it had 10 or 20 people worldwide. I see their propaganda now and then, mostly in Libcom, but I can't force myself to read more than a paragraph or two at a time. I also know one person who claims to have met an actual ICC member *in the flesh*. The ICC are so irrelevant that these two claims together may make me something of a 'world's expert' on them.

Be that as it may anarchist opinions vary, as they should, about the nature and prospects of the revolution in Kurdistan. There is nothing wrong with looking at what is happening there dispassionately. The Dauv article, of course, crosses the line into sectarian attack, and it also spends an inordinate amount of time on matters that are either irrelevant or make sense only to those conversant with the private language of leftism.

It should be noted that the British Anarchist Federation is part of the [International of Anarchist Federations](http://www.i-f-a.org) that has affiliates across Europe and South America. Anyone can look at their websites to see the general support for the Kurds, support that like that of the AF extends into the real world and out of the politically correct circles of fans of things like ROAR magazine. You have also pointed out the activity of the platformist oriented groups which hasn't been minuscule. 

The IWA-AIT doesn't seem to have a generally accepted position on the Kurdistan issue, but they have no generally accepted position on a whole lot of things. Judging from the position of the Spanish CNT they are most definitely 'pro-Kurd', and given the nature of the IWA-AIT I think that pretty well goes for the international sections as well.

The anarchosyndicalist unions outside of the AIT such as the CGT of Spain, the CNT-f of France and the SAC of Sweden have been quite active in promotion of the Kurdish cause, and given that they are larger than the AIT affiliates they have also been able to offer tangible material aid. Other IFA affiliates such as the Fdration anarchiste of France have also been consistent supporters of the Kurds.

In sum the non-English speaking anarchist movement has been consistently and effectively active in support of the revolution in Kurdistan. Many have reservations about the nature of events there and have voiced them, but they are hardly sectarian purists such as those Stanchev pillories. Stanchev's article uses the example of *one* left communist author to attack not just other left communists but also anarchists that he knows full well don't fit into the picture of his strawman. One might wonder about his real purposes, but, as I said, leave that for later. 




 I guess that's likely. Ah, *politicians*. 




 You're welcome. I checked, and what I wrote before is basically accurate. There were, however, two fatalities not one. As of now the fire has been classed as accidental. 




 I'll have to check the reports, but my memory says that the fire began in a residential unit near to the AK Press warehouse. I believe there was one fatality. In other words AK was more of a 'bystander' to this event. The damage to their stock was from smoke and water.

I don't know about the general measures that the landlord (they rent a spot in a complex owned by somebody else) took or didn't take as to fire safety, and the legal responsibility of the landlord is they weren't 'up to code'. In many (most ?) jurisdictions in North America landlords are required to have working fire alarms in their units. There may be places where sprinkler systems are required in commercial units, but I *think* there are not many of those. The premises were mixed commercial/residential. I'll be back to you when I check the details of the event. 




 Thanks. I missed the man himself in my search. Much appreciated. 




 I think you're right. My understanding of it is that a mutation in a suppressor gene essentially causes it to make an inoperative product. Perhaps, however, if the mutation weren't in said gene itself but in its allied 'controllers' there may be a possibility. Say that p51 is controlled by a set of promoters, initiators and its own suppressers, and a mutation at a different site "supressed the suppressor(s) of the suppressor". Complicated....yes.  




 It's true about his previous record, but hopefully, as you say, his present opinion is a bit more stable. I know....stable opinions and principles from a politician ?????? 




 Thanks for the warning. I didn't think of the possibility that someone might try foxglove as a DIY experiment. People do things that are inconceivable to me. 




 Arnie as Arnie or Arnie as Conan ? I never knew that. Where can I find him here ?

Edit: It's OK. I found the r/arnoldschwartzenegger subreddit. Neat. Next I'll go looking for Conan. 




 I'm glad you pointed out some of the complications here, but I am puzzled about one thing. I can't think of any situation where licensing is "a tool to keep markets competitive". Maybe it's just too late at night and my mind is in cruise control, but can you give an example ? 




 Oh shit. Trouble follows me wherever I go. As the 'copyee' I'm not too upset though I am quite puzzled as to the why and how. I post in a great number of different forums, some of them quite far removed from the anarchist ideology and some of them not political at all. Occasionally I may make a mistake and 'double post' in the same forum even though I have a general procedure for trying to avoid this. At other times I am #2 in a given forum (usually on matters scientific or technical), and the moderators of a given board remove the duplicate and inform me of same. No problem from my point of view. Reddit is often inaccurate in informing a poster of duplicate status. Gotta go for Easter dinner so I'll be back on this later. Good luck, and I advise diplomacy. 




 Yes, but this situation is a bit different. For one he is a Republican. The second point is his fame because of his film career. As you say there are scores of politicians who disagree with such laws, but 'Conan' is more newsworthy than most others. 




 Why not now ? The guy should have watched himself. The Gayluminaty of Vienna have agents everywhere. ;) 




 You and me both. Trying to find interesting subreddits on reddit can be, let us say, "interesting". I'd suggest that the moderators take a look at further promotion of this site. 




 I once read an article that tried to list all the opposition groups in Syria. To say the least there are many. The groups divide along not just religious, ethnic and ideological lines but also along geographic and even personal lines. To make it worse the groups often change their name, ally and un-ally with others. Makes it hard to keep track. 




 ;) .I guess the old 'da debil made me do it' is out of fashion. 




 Cosmology...the game ?  




 That could be amusing. 




 True, but going from here it comes to the classic conclusion of academic papers..."further research is required". 




 Yes, like you I see progress, but the trend is not inevitable. 




 I doubt that that is possible or it just wouldn't be fermentation. Perhaps, however, my imagination is limited. Culture in the presence of carbon dioxide absorbers ? Reutilization of CO2 for other purposes such as organic chemical feedstocks ? Your point is well taken. 




 Thanks for the contribution. I'd be the last to deny that there are 'problems in the house of labor'. To some extent the unions are already reaching out beyond their membership to other unions, social movements and the public at large. There is still a long way to go. The perceived opposition between 'jobs and the environment' as illustrated by your quotation above is a pretty clear example. Union members have to recognize that they aren't just workers but are also members of the community. Reconciling the two 'goods' is a work that is very much in progress. 




 Thank you. That saves me some work in regards to the Kurds. As for pure 'humanitarian' donations for those who want to avoid all politics there is the [Syrian Red Crescent](http://sarc.sy). Be aware that I am unfamiliar with this outfit. I hope it isn't like the Red Cross where 1)you have no control over *what* your donation goes to ie not always the particular call you responded to and 2) a far too large amount of revenue goes to 'administration'. there is also the [UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs](http://www.unocha.org/syria). With this outfit you can be assured that the money donated will go to the cause specified. I don't, however, know about the 'administration overhead'. It's probably less than that of the Red Cross given funding from the UN itself.

I've got to remember to add these pathways to solidarity in future. The donation path is contained in the SFF, but it is hidden in the website. 




 Thank you. I'll be on alert for that. 




 Not really. The article mentions the natural disasters, but it is mainly concerned with the structural deficiencies due to (mainly) American influence in that country. The two are not necessarily unconnected. A country's ability to recover from natural disasters depends on the capacity of its infrastructure and organization. Haiti's history has left it dramatically deficient in the sort of 'civil society' organizations that quite frequently help recovery more than either the government or foreign aid NGOs. In connection with the latter there are numerous accounts of how aid 'pledges' are not being fulfilled or of how the money is pissed away or wasted on useless projects once it does arrive.

I can appreciate your feeling that the left, most particularly the American left, overemphasizes the role of American foreign policy and corporations in every single problem anywhere in the world. I put it this way; "Americans are the most patriotic nation on Earth. They are under the illusion that all that is good in the world only exists because of the USA. If Americans "catch leftism" they switch over to blaming the US for everything bad anywhere. This attitude is just as patriotic as the first. All it does is switch the adjectives." In this case, however, throwing rocks at the White House is the proper description to a first approximation.

As a side note of interest anarchists have a dog in this fight. In the past the Haitian union Bataille  Ouvrire has collaborated with anarchosyndicalists and other anarchists. I'm not up to date on what their organization has been doing recently. 




 Thank you. I've already made the post I wanted stickied. Hopefully it will work with editing. I'll see. You've been a great help. 




 Stranger things have happened. There are evangelical Christian Churches that are *definitely* on the left on many issues. 




 I wonder if r/anarchism and r/metanarchism are indeed the top of the mocking list at subs like r/SubRedditDrama ? I've seen it said that the two most popular clowns of stage, screen and politics were u/Laurelai and u/volcanoclosto .  




 True. There are advantages. 




 Please see reply to u/audiored 




 The group that sponsors the [Syria Freedom Forever](http://syriafreedomforever.wordpress.com) page is the [Revolutionary Left Current in Syria](http://revleftcurrentsyria.com). If you look at the link 'Support and Solidarity with the Revolutionary Left Current in Syria' on their page banner. You will see the information for donations to their work in Syria.

In the interests of transparency it should be noted that the Revolutionary Left Current are Trotskyist in orientation. They are, however, very non-sectarian, and given the situation in the many sided Syrian civil war a donation to them is also a donation to others such as the Kurds with whom they are in alliance.

Personally I don't share their political opinions, but I still feel that they are progressive in the context they operate in. There are many sides there, the Assad government, ISIS, the al-Nusra al-Qaeda branch franchise, the Kurds and a plethora of other groups based on ethnicity and/or political positions. Within that fractured 'others' grouping some are quite content to be essentially American puppets while others look towards a more non-aligned and/or socialist future.

The Kurds have mounted a much wider network for international solidarity through their anarchist allies. I will provide links to them as well as non-political relief agencies ( for those who are uncomfortable with *any* political group) later today.

  




 Yes, that's interesting isn't it. 




 Yes, I'll agree. The goal is clear and not befuddled by other side issues. Like you I think that clarity is important.  




 I see. I'm not immediately familiar with either the brewing or the wine industry though I am familiar with other parts of agriculture. As a point of interest one side of my family were vintners way back and far, far away, but it is more than a few worlds away. Talk about cows and wheat (or even barley or oats) and I can hold a sensible conversation. I did have an uncle by marriage who worked in a winery (and grew his own grapes from Italy for his own wine in his backyard), but that's about all for an immediate connection.

I thank you very much for your contribution even though I still think that beer and wine are a bit more 'civilized' than bottled water. Nestl has an unadmirable record in many places in the world, not just in California, and I still see the point of the demonstrators. 




 True. My own personal political beliefs favor the maximum possible amount of decentralization *possible*. The key word is 'possible'. There are difficulties in the application of decentralization, and I think it should be more an often unrealizable ideal rather than an ideological 'demand'. How this works out in the gradual process of social change I can't and I think nobody can give simplistic and dogmatic answers. Practice makes perfect, and it also makes real.

Thanks for your opinions. 




 Your numbers appear to be correct. The 'water footprint' of brewing is in the ranges you suggest even though 98% of the *total* water accounting is prior to brewing in the cultivation of barley and hops. 




 That's a good point. My mind got fixated on bottles. As I said I'll look. Thank you. 




 You might be right. The articles I remember were about crops for human consumption. The alfalfa fields that I am familiar with, however, are not irrigated. It might be different in drier places. More stuff to look up. 




 That's interesting. I'm going to have to look up the process. All that I know immediately is from 'home-brewing' where basically 1 gallon of water equals one gallon of beer minus minor loss via waste. Working from basic principles there would have to be some very large dump of waste water from causes I am unfamiliar with given that the main process of beer production after fermentation is filtration to improve clarity. Bottle washing ? Hopefully back to you later. 




 No problem. 




 All microbiology aside the taste of well water that puts some people off is basically from two chemical factors: hardness and nitrate content. The first is basically harmless, but *I* can tell the taste difference. To me bottled water often tastes 'flat'. Despite all the endless mineral content that is sometimes listed on the label it hardly ever seems 'hard'. Some of this may also be due to the lack of the chlorinated hydrocarbons that often give tap water its taste. One thing that should be noted however. There has been more than one case where so-called 'spring water', 'mineral water', whatever has been nothing more than the tap water of the town where the plant is located.

Your illness was probably due to bacterial or parasitic causes which can be a community-wide problem or just leaky pipes in a neighbourhood or single residence. High nitrate concentrations can lead to diarrhea but rarely to vomiting in my knowledge. 




 I don't know. It seems like a question that could be answered. 




 I'd have to consult a time zone map. As of now it's about 16:00 GMT. If you go east 8 times zones then it is indeed tomorrow. I guess that's Beijing time. Yeah, that's right. Noon is quite arbitrary. 




 The water quality of tap water varies with the location, treatment used and time of year. Personally I grew up in a small 'town' (to overstate the case) where all water was well water. It got stinky at times, but few people got sick from it. I guess we all adjusted. Sometimes that's impossible. I know of one reservation that has had a 'boil water' advisory for upwards of 17 years, and there may be worse cases. Back in the days when I had money to travel one of the first things I'd do when the plane touched down is immediately drink the local water. Sort of get it over with.

In any case one thing I know about the issue from reading about it over the years... there is *no* guarantee that bottled water will be any better than tap water except in regards to the market-sensitive matter of 'taste'. Sometimes it's worse. 




 I guess, but try to remember that life is not an online game. It's *real*. Please also try and remember that pretty well *all* of the protestors care about the issue, not about theater. 




 I guess, but try to remember that life is not an online game. It's *real*. 




 Two peas, same pod. 




 Well, now that I`ve been mercifully banned from r/anarchism I can speak my mind. As far as 'leftydom' goes I've been around from before the time most of the r/metanarchism cult's *parents* were in diapers. Here's the problem: as I see it *both* the fake anarchists *and* the 'tankies' as you call them have been gradually dumbed down over the last few decades. There is some commonality between the two groups for the simple reason that both have been sinking in both quality and public appeal for a long time.

Commies are, of course, strange, and given their youth they have no memory of what Leninism in power actually was. They mirror the bizarros who want to reanimate fascism, and their is now exchange of personnel between them, the faux-anarchists and the nostalgic fascists. To a large extent the motives behind adherence to any one of these so-called 'options' is the same - identity seeking amongst a large group of empty lost people.

The faux-anarchists look like the 'tankies' because their causes, their convoluted 'theory' and their motivation are the same. A lot of this, at least the crude justification of it, can be blamed on my own generation. Politically correct Maoists gave up on 'The Revolution', went into academic careers and kept their attitudes intact. They taught them to new generations with different targets for totalitarianism but the same methods.

Have hope. Most of these fuckers took the early retirements from academia that they qualified for. Demographics will do what argument cannot. 




 Yes, I remember reading about water requirements for various crops, and I seem to recall that almonds were the highest. 




 What it is is getting *exactly* the same physical result without the cost of loss of public sympathy and legal complications. All that is 'lost' by using the tactics they did is some sense of personal superiority. People can live without that.

As an interesting contrast I posted this item elsewhere, and an opponent of the action waded in with a complaint that the police "didn't enforce the law". That person made the same mistake you do only he was on the other side. The police got their job done without loss of public sympathy and with far less complications than adding in with clubs swinging.

The protesters knew their job, and the police knew theirs. Each side acted to get what they wanted with the least cost.

Cost and benefit.  




 No where near the amount of guns dedicated to protecting the ability of business to exploit their workers. No where near. 




 That gives all sorts of workers the opportunity to walk out. 




 Ever read the 'Book of Revelation' ? A lot of people in the first two centuries CE believed that it was indeed a travel guide rather than poetry, and they also took the "this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished" bit elsewhere quite literally.

So...in the interim while waiting for the seven angels, seven trumpets and seven seals and all the other sevens there are other things to do. Think about it. 




 On occasion their falsehoods actually cross the line into real criminal libel. 




 I see the article mentions farmworkers and domestic care workers as being left out. There is another category, that of workers in industries where tips are a practice. Most of this is the restaurant industry, but I'm sure they may be others. 




 Support. This will be nothing if not interesting. But you know Post, in the end you're going to regret this. It will only be fun for a short time. Think ahead, think ahead.

On a side note wasn't the r/postleftanarchism addition voted on months ago and had a yes ? 




 Busy, busy, busy Mr Rent Check ? Here's wishing you a fat old time. 




 Actually given the intellectual tools he had he did a fairly good job. A few things should be noted. The first is that his book wasn't just about the fate of state socialist societies. Burnham, like others at the time, saw fascism and American-style corporatism as equally roads that were leading to a 'new mode of production' (Marxist category) with the managers replacing the capitalists as the ruling class.

The second thing to note is that this was a dispute that did indeed begin amongst Trotskyists. There were basically three positions vis-a-vis the so-called 'socialist states'. The orthodox one is the 'deformed workers' state' which saw nothing wrong with a system of nationalized industry and said that the 'proletariat' could exercise ultimate control over such an economy via its political organization(s). The second was the 'state capitalism' position which tried to describe the 'socialist' states as merely another form of capitalism which the workers couldn't control with minor reforms. The final position, Burnham's one, was what is called 'bureaucratic collectivism' which said, as mentioned above, that the managers were a new ruling class and the economies they controlled were fundamentally different from capitalism.

The 'bureaucratic collectivism' position is inherently unstable. It is often a stop-over point to a final destination on either the right, like Burnham, or to the left as in council communism. The internal operations of a Leninist party are simply too obvious and easy to describe as such a new class in embryo to lead to an 'enduring marriage'.

Another thing to be considered is that writers on the 'New Class' seem to be almost always blind to either writers who commented on the subject before. You will find no mention in Burnham of Jan Waclaw Machjiaski and the 'Workers' Conspiracy', despite the fact that this group was well known amongst the Russian revolutionaries. Neither will you find any credit being given to a number of fairly unradical orthodox economists such as Berle and Means who described the process of 'managerialization' in Western 'capitalism' before he did.

Going forward you will find ex-communist dissidents such as Milovan Djilas who wrote his 'The New Class' focused only on East Bloc (and his native Yugoslavia of which he was once vice-president) with no reference to either fascism nor Western corporate structure. This tradition of not giving credit continues today in the writings of the advocates of Parecon who never note the ancestry of their 'coordinator class'. 

Burnham's central idea was hardly his alone, and like all the many others who have written on the subject he would have laughed at the idea that the trends he was describing were due to some subjective conscious "wanting" on the part of the socialists. At the time he wrote he was still a good enough Marxist to bring old Karl's opinion on subjective desires and social change to bear on such an opinion. If a landslide in in process it doesn't matter what the boulders want.

I could say more, but deviating a bit from the subject you will find the essence of Burnham's position described quite well in "The Book" supposedly written by the dissident Goldstein in Orwell's 1984. 




 Yes true. That's a possible explanation as well. 




 My cynical mind comes up with the idea that some people are only happy when they are fighting. 




 mBio is the journal of the American Society for Microbiology which, according to their self-description has 30,000 members. You may wish to investigate their organization before any further comments. The point you raise about 'detergents' may be well taken given other information about such things as a pathway to resistance via active export of antimicrobials being promoted due to 'hand sanitizers' in common use. Perhaps you might want to write the journal about your concerns but please remember the following:

*If certain products are 'always' combinations of certain ingredients and if the products in question lead to certain results one might argue about 'which' ingredient is the culprit, but one cannot argue that the effect is not produced unless, of course, the research fails to be replicated.* 




 The best place to begin is with [Le Monde Libertaire](http://www.monde-libertaire.fr). It's the press organ of the FA (Fdration anarchiste the major grouping of French-speaking anarchists in France, Belgium and Switzerland). Look back to the January issue for the FA's statement and follow the news items for further developments. The anarchosyndicalist CNT-f (Vignolles) and other groups not affiliated to the FA spoke in the same manner.

In Spain the anarchist groups and unions reacted in the same manner. This included the CNT, the CGT, Solidaridad Obrera and the FAI. The most 'heated' item I read was in the pages of Umanita Nova, the organ of the Italian FAI (the *real* one not the shady one).Unfortunately I had to use Google Translate on this, but the blood and thunder came through nonetheless. Nobody can beat the Italians for shear high emotion hatred of religion.

You might also want to look at the website of the [International of Anarchist-Federations](http://i-a-f.org) for links to other groups. I can look up further French links for you if you like.

All the statements and reporting are of a type. They include:

-Clear condemnations of the Charlie Hebdo murderers with *no* hedging or hinting about how somehow the victims "deserved it" because they weren't up to 'anti-isms' of American ~~psychology cult~~ leftism.

-A clear and undisguised statement about how such murderous acts serve the interests of the state and the right by providing justification for further repression.

-A clear explanation of why the anarchists don't wish to participate in many of the 'Je suis Charlie' events because of the use that the state makes of these and the presence of some *very* unsavoury groups in the lineup of these events.

-Warnings of the backlash against European Muslims and statements of solidarity *with the very important provisio that the anarchists will not cease anti-religious propaganda* in relation to Islam and other religions. Nor will they associate with extreme theocratic groups under some pretense of 'solidarity'.

-Statements about the role of Western imperialism in Muslim countries *without trying to lay all the blame on this factor*.

So have a look. In the anglosphere 'PCism' is not the exclusive possession of the anarchists. It infects most of the left to one degree or another, especially in the USA. It's not an affliction that is shared by many in the rest of the world. 




 Don't forget omega191, the banned account from which the person in question snuck back as volcanoclosto. 




 Well at least for pharmaceutical companies. 




 Oppose. Accusations of say 'pedophilia' and rape threats are, of course, serious matters that happen to cross the line into criminal libel if unsubstantiated. Hmmmm. Accusations of doxxing aren't considered an offense outside of reddit where it is the doxxing itself that is considered serious.

In all cases the claims must be substantiated, and truth is a defense. The last item, however, is far more serious than anything covered in internet rules or in the criminal law. To disprove the accusation a person would have to provide evidence that it *isn't* true. In any case being volc is about the worst insult anybody could utter.  




 It really depends on the character of the recipient.  




 The first thing that comes to my mind is that the whole effect could possibly be explained by the idea that the rats became 'laid back'. That is they were putting less stress on the bone to be healed. 




 Thank you. I had a look at the item, and it seems that the lobbying on the part of industry has only been minimally successful. The lobby's target is the Black Congressional Caucus, and they will, of course, look at the matter from the point of view of their interest group. The most likely outcome is likely to be that black legislators will be 'on side' with solar providing it can be demonstrated that the interests of black people are properly protected.

The question is much bigger 'out on the rez', and the general consensus of First Nations is that solar energy is very much in their interests. In many cases the cost advantage of solar is even greater for native communities because of the cost of power transmission to isolated communities. There are cases where native groups oppose certain projects, but they are outweighed by the far more numerous cases where tribes are developing their own solar resources.

I'm not surprised that industry lobbyists will lobby who and where they can. While their arguments are not as dramatically ridiculous as they are in the case of reservations I personally think that the final conclusion of the debate will be that solar energy is of net benefit to black communities as well.

In any case it's very interesting, and I thank you once more for pointing out something that my weak old eyes missed. Gotta get those peepers checked. 




 If you read any of the Latin languages such as French, Spanish or Italian you can see a vast gulf between the anarchist opinion on the continent and the PC reflex so prevalent in the English language press/web. Anarchism is a well thought out tradition in such places, not dominated by the academy and 'professional leftists'. 




 I've gone through the article twice, and I can't find any mention of "race". The "poor" are mentioned briefly. What part of the article are you speaking of ? 




 *Leaving Fantasy Island*

The reason God gave you fingers is so that you could count. I know you'd *like* it to be that min_thamee was banned "4-5 times in the past year", but that's pure imagination. Here's the reality.

On January 29, 2014 min_thamee was banned unilaterally by emma____ when he had the user name of alookyaw. He returned under the new name of min_dami, and eventually he fessed up and asked to be unbanned. This was approved by a majority. The request was made on July 10, 2014. On October 22, 2014 a ban was proposed, relying on obviously false information, and it was carried.

OK, take out those fingers. "*In the last year*" alookya/min_dami/min_thamee was banned a grand total of **one** time. Go back to the textbook, and look it up. Funny thing, *one* is **not** equal to *4-5*. Even if one were to grant that a 'year' is a 'social construction' and has 14 months rather than 12, *two* is still not equal to *4-5*.

The only way you can reach 4-5 is to include the 3 (I think) times somebody posted on meta *complaining* that min_dami hadn't been banned.

As to the three accounts matter the first change is explained above. The second was **publically** announced when min_thamee was under the mistaken impression that changing the account name would lead to a lessening of some of the pressure on him. No such luck. Not a snowball's chance in hell. Still - no sneakiness involved as is plainly shown by the record. 




 My mistake. "W"s don't do well on my keyboard. Good catch. Actually if you think of the utilities as pirates it makes perfect sense. :) 




 Just fyi the user in question is 'the man of a thousand faces' aka jaki/stirner/crabs/syndicate_V/ CGU_Bad_For_Business,  etc., etc., etc.. Good old Mr. Rentcheck has been banned more times, under more names, than you have fingers - in a single year. If you want a permanent ban it's already in place many, many times. Good luck. 
























 "My name is Barack Obama, and I approve these shoes" ? 




 Municipal workers. One of the main grievances is that the municipality arranges to employ people part-time so as to avoid benefits due to full time workers. 




 I've seen some, mostly on the CGT's website but also on that of the CNT I believe. All were solely in Spanish. 




 I've said this before elsewhere. It's the NITPIMBY phenomena -Not In The Pool In My Back Yard. 




 Probably very far indeed. The authors found that there are multiple alleles for the gene coding hyaluronan even amongst the naked mole-rat's closer relatives. The one amino acid substitution un ique to this animal may not work at all in an organism far from the clade like humans because multiple substitutions may be necessary. 




 Living Utopia is a great documentary. There are some other documentaries on the Spanish anarchists and the Civil War, but this is the only one which, to my knowledge, has the English subtitles. Others are only in Spanish. Am I wrong ? Are there others ? 




 Seems like a worthy project. I see you're already a member of the US Federation of Worker Co-ops. You might be interested in the r/economicdemocracy subreddit. Also if you haven't already do look at the [1worker1vote](http://1orker1vote.org) website for an example of another ongoing project. Also have a look at the [IWW](http://www.iww.org) website and see if you might want to sign up. 




 NITPIMBY - Not in the pool in my back yard. 




 That's a thought actually. 




 Terse and very much to the point. 




 You're welcome. 




 That may be true.

Durante la intervencin militar rusa en Crimea, Alexandr Koltchenko organiz manifestaciones pacficas de protesta contra la ocupacin militar, que false el referndum, al lado de ciudadanxs ttarxs, ucranianxs o rusxs. Algunos das antes de una de estas manifestaciones, la polica poltica rusa (FSB) secuestr a varios organizadores de estas resistencias populares; fue el caso de A. Kolchenko, le 16 de mayo de 2014.

Con otras tres personas secuestradas as, se le acus en particular  de organizacin de un grupo terrorista relacionado con la ultraderecha ucraniana . De ah una serie de acusaciones delirantes: a Kolchenko se le acusa de haber planificado explosiones cerca de la estatua de Lenin en Simferpol los 8 y 9 de mayo, saboteado lneas de ferrocarriles y elctricas, intentado incendiar locales de la Unidad Rusa y de la Comunidad rusa de Crimea el 14 de abril, y los de Rusia Unida el 18 de abril!

Alexandr Koltchenko es un antifascista que la polica poltica trata de hacer pasar por un fascista.

Alexandr Kolchenko es un hombre que se considera comme ciudadano ucraniano y que la polica poltica rusa quiere juzgar en tanto que ruso. Est encerrado en condiciones drsticas, sus abogados estn privados de los derechos elementales de una defensa digna de este nombre y el est bajo la amenaza de 15 a 20 aos de campo de trabajo.

A. Kolchenko es estudiante y militante sindical; tambin trabajaba de cartero, en paralelo con sus estudios. Defiende activamente, con su prctica, el derecho de organizarse libremente, ee derecho de crear y animar organizaciones asociativas, sindicales, ecologistas o polticas.

Forma parte de los hombres y mujeres que luchan contra la extrema derecha, que sea ucraniana, rusa u otra.

Puesto que est luchando contra la corrupcin y por la igualdad de derechos entre todxs, A. Koltchenko es el blanco de los clanes oligrquicos en Rusia y Ucrania.

A. Kolchenko milita por el derecho de cada pueblo a decidir de su propio porvenir.

La situacin de A. Kolchenko es emblemtica de la represin ejercida en esta regin del mundo. Pero su caso dista mucho de ser el nico. A travs de A. Kolchenko, sont las libertades democrticas de todxs las que defendemos. Nuestra actuacin, como la A. Kolchenko, se opone a quienes desean menguar dichas libertades.

Por la liberacin inmediata de Alexandr Kolchenko y por las libertades democrticas en todos los pases, nuestras organizaciones asociativas, sindicales y polticas piden, con motivo del Uno de mayo, la ampliacin de la solidaridad internacional con el fin de denunciar el secuestro y la detencin de A. Kolchenko por les autoridades rusas (que decidirn la fecha de su juicio a principio del mes de mayo), exigir sa liberacin inmediata, y para que el Gobierno ucraniano reivindique explcitamente la liberacin de Alexandr Kolchenko.

Despus de la semana de accin de inicios de abril (manifestaciones en Biarritz, Pars, Estrasburgo, Marsella Kiev, Minsk, Berln, Bremen y Tnez) lanzamos una suscripcin para financiar los gastos de justicia y auxiliar a los comits de apoyo para popularizar la campaa de solidaridad en Rusia y en Ucrania. Las ayudas se deben remitir a Solidaires Comit Kolchenko, 144, bd de la Villette, 75019 Pars.

 Erdogan doesn't *always* get his own way. 




 Well the wording of the law is probably just some 'tuck in' put in to satisfy someone in the process of drafting it who is unclear on the concept even though...get ready for it... it is *technically* possible. Let's go to mtf surgery first because it is the easiest case. What the surgeon can do is instead of removing the testicles is replace them in the inguinal area, preserve the vas deferens and reposition its outlet to a place in the new vagina. To my knowledge this has never been done. What it is is an artificial mimicking of cryptorchidism, undescended testicles, the most common birth defect involving the genitals (1 to 3% of regular births, up to 30% of premmies). One possible side effect would be *reduced* fertility, though this may not be complete. Up to 11% of retained testicles can still produce sperm. Another possibility is a higher risk of cancer in the repositioned testicles. Retained testicles have a significantly higher risk. I have no idea of what the risk would be in comparison to congenital cryptorchidism, and because it hasn't been done before nobody else does either. 

There are probably other things to consider that are outside my knowledge, but I can be fairly certain that *no* legislator knows even the little I have described above. The result would be a physiologically fertile male with none of the genitalia involved in actual sex-related fertilization. I suppose any sperm produced could possibly be harvested and used for AI. Boy would that be a good one for a hospital ethics committee.

Just last year the first reported uterine/ovarian transplants were done in Sweden. These were, of course, done on females. How this will work out in terms of tolerance and fertility I don't know, and once more I'm fairly confident that *nobody* knows. Can rejection be managed without enough deleterious side effects so that a normal pregnancy can happen ? Time will tell. Transplant medicine has certainly made major advances over the years, but this is an 'edge of the universe' surgery. Who knows. As to creating a normal and functional birth canal along with this, well the surgeon that could do this would be in line for divinity. This news is also probably unknown (or forgotten) to almost every legislator in the world though it was given a certain amount of publicity.

As to ftm surgery there would be an 'outside' chance that testicular transplants could also be possible though this also involves more than simply a 'new pair of nuts'. To my knowledge the only testicular 'transplants' that have been done are 'autologous' ie the tissue is from the patient's own body. This has been done for patients undergoing chemotherapy which will destroy fertility. Pre-chemo testicular tissue is harvested and later replaced post-chemo. Obviously this can't be done in mtf sex reassignment. There has to be a separate donor. Then there is the process involved in creating a *functional* system like the difficulty in creating a birth canal. The surgeon involved may not be eligible for godhood, but *would* be a candidate for canonization.

So, summing it up the procedures to retain fertility in sex reassignment surgeries are *possible* though fraught with difficulty. I doubt, however, that these details were known to the bureaucrats framing the legislation or legislators discussing it. So, I may be wrong, but I believe that the stipulation was placed in the bills out of pure confusion. 




 I wonder hat their annual production is. 




 I wonder who could have downvoted this and what their reason might be. My imagination says that it might indicate that if I die I might unexpectedly have "benefit of clergy". This canonization has long been a contentious one. The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/22/us/to-some-indians-in-california-father-serra-is-far-from-a-saint.html?_r=0) and, [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/25/pope-francis-junipero-serra-sainthood-native-american-controversy) have covered it last January. Here's a couple of interesting facts:

1)The planned canonization of Serra is being announced *at the same time* as the US Senate is debating the removal of his statue from the National Statuary Hall on the Capital. The proposal moves to replace it with a statue of astronaut Sally Ride. 

2)The first 'miracle' which allowed Pope John Paul to beatify (elevate to the status of 'Blessed') was the supposedly 'authentic' cure of a nun with lupus in 1986. Now lupus is an 'interesting' disease. The prognosis very frequently involves a waxing and waning course including apparent spontaneous remissions. In other words this is a rather threadbare miracle. In any case he became "Blessed' in 1987.

3)There also a couple of other things that even the great majority of Catholics don't know. One is that the old rule that it took *two* authenticated miracles to go up the Sainthood ladder is being waived more and more. A lot of recent Saints owe their title to this change in practice. It seems that every advance in medical science leads there to be fewer and fewer good miracles to go around.

4) But there's still more that is also unknown to even the vast majority of Catholics. Remember the 'Devil's Advocate' (called the Advocatus Diabolicus by the Church ) ? 'Remember' is the proper word. No such thing anymore, for some time actually. This official of the 'Congregation for the Causes of Saints' was abolished in 1987 by then Pope John Paul II. The 'Saint Machine' has an easier and easier time of it these days.



3) 




 If you track through on the reference in Le Monde to the site of the National Assembly you get a complete vote total with abstentions. The three Front de Gauche members voted *pour/for* the bill. There were no abstentions from their caucus. There were a number of abstentions amongst the PS bloc. 




 Have they not 'failed' multiple times before ? 




 The Hubble Site may have more references on it. 




 I see. The data was gathered by a collaboration between the three different telescopes so I guess this is indeed 'different'. 




 I'm afraid that I have a hard time determining what the difference between the two would be. 




 That's interesting. I wonder what the percentages are. 




 Thanks. 




 Yes, Utah is not the only place where this model is being applied. It just happened to be in the news now. The difference is that a need is being met without assuming that you have to punish and 'correct' first. 




 'McCafe' ? Big in the cup but mostly foam ? 




 Yes, generally they are very young and un-experienced. It isn't just the mods. It's also the clique/cult in which they are situated. The life-stylism definitely yes. Their isolation and cliquishness shows over and over. The post-leftism less so - *except* there is a sort of 'alliance' going on. Post-leftists are allowed a lot of leeway that sensible people are not *provided that they make the properly politically correct noises* and especially join in the gang-ups. They are even allowed to make properly *abstract* criticisms of identity politics provided, of course that they remain abstract and don't interfere with the day-to-day application of PC witch hunting and that they join the mob when called. The two points of view are, of course, totally incompatible in reality, but in addition to ignorance about anarchism the clique/cult has an amazing ability to avoid coherent thought.

I've often struggled about how to describe the things I see there, and several uncomplimentary adjectives come to mind. Of course what they preach was pretty well unknown 20 years ago even if it as actually beginning then. Think the faction fights in Love and Rage. L   R had a deeper history. Go back further, say 40 to 45 years ago when I first became an anarchist. Yes, I'm an old fart. The division was even deeper then, but there was something happening then that is very similar to these people now. Think the Weatherman cult, as the New Left was disintegrating and some of it was sinking into the Maoist black hole. All the glorification of mindless violence. Up to and including hero worshipping the Charley Manson cult.The desperation of a declining movement that couldn't accept the fact. The reduction of politics to slogans and simplistic hatreds. The imaginary identification with a caricature of an 'oppressed' that in reality wants nothing to do with them. It's all there. I've seen this nasty mindlessness before, and it isn't pleasant to see it again.

But this is too long. Talk to you later. But yes, irony is well beyond  them. 




 Got it. 




 You mean that it has already been fading for a long time ? Or that it is too short a time to tell ? 




 Ah, but you have to take an actual numerical estimate, and then repeat it in other locations.  




 No, far from it. Lots of people besides that particular cult have a bone to pick with these actions. 




 Good question. I'll think about this and get back to you. 




 I never knew that. I only became interested in moderation at all, specifically in r/anarchism, about a year ago when I noticed an incredible amount of childish aggression and posturing and... went in search. 




 I guess that's within the realm of the possible. There has, however, been tension and disagreements between them before. 




 I'm fairly confident that that is true. 




 Yes, of course, free speech has been a cardinal point of doctrine amongst *the majority* of the anarchist movement since the 1800s. Whatever doubt there may have been was more than resolved by bitter experience, particularly the Russian Revolution but also the Spanish case. I think one of the keys to understanding the strange opinions of the cult/clique that runs r/anarchism is the fact that they know very little about anarchism. The level of ignorance there is truly amazing. I've seen more than one person try to point out the disconnect between what they believe (and unfortunately practice) and the anarchist tradition. Quite often these obvious facts are simply deleted. 

I am not as familiar with the situation in r/socialism, but I assume it is the same though less dramatic. Certainly less silly posturing about violence in imaginary internet worlds. But is this merely my lower familiarity rather than a real difference ? I don't know.  




 As I've said here before it's been years since I've eaten at McDonald's. One thing I remember though. The Big Mac was as likely as not to make me feel nauseous. I don't know why. Maybe the mayo ? I ended up sticking to the plain burger you mentioned. Now you tell me it's gone. Too bad. 




 I guess that's true in the case of a Commonwealth as opposed to a State 




 I haven't disgraced their doors for a long time, but I can certainly see your point. 




 Well, even though I don't agree with your politics I'm glad you are starting this alternative, and I wish you success. There has been at least one other alternative sub on the socialist side of things: r/socialistbeta  that was set up as a hopeful alternative to the generally low level of discussion on r/socialism. One of the big problems is that a crusade for purity naturally attracts the most aggressive characters, and these come to dominate the whole discussion. It also attracts those who, bluntly, *don't give a flying fuck about making the ideas popular but would rather construct an imaginary identity*. From that point of view driving people away very much serves their purpose. In the end the online 'community' comes to be representative not of the general run of the mill person who holds certain ideas but rather of a self selected 'elite' of the most aggressive.

The problem is, in fact, worse on the anarchist side of things, and there have been several attempts over the years at alternative subs that might 'tone up' the intelligence level and 'tone down' the triple distilled hatred. r/AnarchistNews is the most long lasting of these. I've recently started another, r/worldanarchism, which will hopefully concentrate on *non-American* news and views. The shared problem of both anarchists and socialists on reddit isn't even representative of the majority of American leftists, but it is certainly more concentrated in the USA than anywhere else. 

That's all. Good luck. 




 Picture Obama coming ashore wearing a sombrero. 




 I don't think this is universally true, and it certainly is a lot better than in the USA. 




 Most of the people I have known over time who have been 'on call' have been relatively well paid (railroad, medical, seasonal 'emergency', etc..). It can be nerve wracking even if you're paid well, and indeed on call for low wages is an atrocity. 




 I want to thank you immensely for your contribution here. I was thinking of trying to answer some of the assertions myself, but I obviously would have had to do a lot of research to find the facts that are at your fingertips. This is greatly appreciated.  




 Says the fool who doesn't know anything about hat he yells at. I do know quite a bit about the legacy of Stalinism, more than a rhetoric spouting idiot who lumps everything he hates together and has no concept of actual history. What I do know is that good fanatics like yourself are the willing tools of every dictatorial regime. Try to know something about what you pontificate on next time. 




 One can only hope that the US intelligence agents responsible will also be brought to justice. 




 I guess it's a  temporal wormhole from Newton to Einstein, but, what the heck, facts can get in the way of many good stories. Honestly I had a hard time even understanding some of the comments. Information is indeed irretrievably lost, and that string proves it.  




 Yes, it does. The authors found that oxytocin receptors occurred on both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. They were also quite explicit that their discovery of the lateralization to the left auditory cortex was quite important as well. What they didn't make plain, in my opinion, was whether the receptors on the inhibitory neurons 'tuned down' previously existing inhibition of that brain area due to said neurons or whether the inhibitory neurons were stimulated to inhibit *other* neurons that 'tuned down' a prior response to excitatory impulses. 




 I never looked at them. Let's see.

EDIT: I looked, and I see what you mean. It starts with 'white holes' and goes downhill from there. Actually a few of the comments were sensible, but many went into the zone of not even being wrong. 




 Oh Jesus H. Christ. My first honest-to-God serious right winger on this subreddit. Oh boy, oh boy, oh, boy. Please step towards that vat of liquid amber over there. I want to treasure this moment and preserve it for posterity.

In any case this reinforces my decision to try and concentrate this subreddit on *non-American* anarchist news. You may not be an anarchist, but you sure as hell are an American. The USA is the only country in the world, to my knowledge, where ignorance amongst a large fraction of the population (on both the left and the right) is considered a virtue. For the *majority* of Americans, however, and the overwhelming majority of the rest of the world "larnin'" as my old man would have said is a *good* thing.

In any case I'd rather talk to the original poster, but I'll kindly provide a few facts of life to brighten up your dismal world. There is such a thing as 'Marxism-Leninism' which is the *actual* meaning of the word 'communist' when it is used in everyday talk. This thing is *not* the same as the economic system of 'communism' which may or may not be achievable. Marxist-Leninists do indeed aim at dictatorship, but *so do numerous dictatorships, actual and potential, supported by the USA across the world*. There is a big world of political differences outside of crude right wing American rhetoric that said rhetoric tries, sometimes desperately, to ignore. 

Some anarchists may be, shall we say, 'dodgy', but the majority of the movement across the world has *never* advocated dictatorship of *any* sort. It's actually the *exact* opposite of that. If you wish to pontificate on 'anarchism' I'd suggest you find out what it actually is first. 

As for the original poster I will be asking questions of them and talking to them soon. The point that you should know, assuming you are interested in learning anything at all, is that their ideology, so-called 'African socialism' is not, not, not the same thing as communism/Marxism-Leninism. It has resulted in dictatorship in some places in the past, but these regimes have not shared the totalitarian ambitions of Marxist-Leninists. I disagree with that ideology, but your tiny world view blinds you to what it actually is.

 




 No problem. I am just being neurotic. 




 Oops. I will delete and repost. 




 That's an unsettling thought isn't it. 




 I think the author actually agrees with you. What he is doing is posing a question of how information/resources could be exchanged between components of the 'new economy' while maintaining its democratic nature. Is this an easy question ? No, and you pose one of the problems. What I would say is 'keep the risks small'. It's a matter of future discussion. 




 It's meant to be. 




 Yes, it does. It's a sudden burst of color seen at sunset if conditions are right. 




 I suspect that Cheney more or less likes his family.  




 I think that there are two different conceptions of both morality and free will operating here. From what you say the 'free choice' of an agent in a situation of incomplete information is, to Harris, the be all and end all of the morality of said choice with no reference to consequences. I think Chomsky is alluding to the way in which self deception (which he and Robert Trivers have discussed) plays a role in grading the morality of a choice. The information available to a free agent can be *deliberately* incomplete because of a prior decision to avoid certain information. I don't think Chomsky makes this plain, but it seems to be a factor to me. In this case the 'negligence' is deliberate and the 'severity' could have been predicted by information that the agent avoids.

OK, that's all the philosophy that I'm going to do today. 




 The world always holds surprises. It depends every much on how much pressure the USA decides to apply and *also* on what credibility their pressure has in Ecuador today. In Ecuador itself the issue is a 'cross-class' one gaining support from a number of sectors of the population. 




 I'm not that familiar with Harris. Does he make his money by 'punditry' ? 




 Yes, that's probably a valid criticism. 




 Thanks. I forgot about that detail. 




 Are the Libertarians in power in *any* of the US States where marijuana has been decriminalized ? Never say never. It took a right wing Administration to end the Vietnam War and to open up to China. The world is complicated. 




 A few probably have, but an even rarer event is that they have had relatives or friends who have gone to prison because of drugs and either die there or die later when they come out worse than before.  




 I'd guess that the only convictions that would be affected would be in Ecuador itself. 




 Thank you for the information. Can you expand on this ? 




 That isn't hat happens in the real world as European experience has demonstrated. 




 You do realize that meth is pretty well a 100% domestic product. 




 I don't know the full details of the legislation. On a local level probably 'yes'. Export ? 




 Which is spent on military expeditions targeting the peasants. That's the reality, and peasants in the Andes know this very well. 




 A few lesser known historical facts should be brought up here. The first was that father Gapon was a paid agent of the Okhrana, the Tsarist secret police. This was part and parcel of the Okhrana's policy of 'police unionism'. It obviously didn't work out very well. It was, of course, from a police point of view not the *greatest* failure. Looking at it from 'over there' precipitating a revolution was less of an 'oops' than having your agents kill government ministers and even the Tsar's uncle. Oops !

Time ran on and the SRs found out that Gapon was a police agent. A group was sent to kill him, commanded by one 'Azef'. The task was completed in 1906. It took three years for Vladimir Burtzev (yay !) to gather enough evidence to show that Azef himself was an Okhrana agent. Azef managed to escape from France where he was operating at the time due to the fact that the 'trial judges' (mostly SRs but including Kropotkin) were *very* much opposed to Burtzev's claim. It's a long story, but Burtzev had to bring forward the fact that he had corrupted a police officer who passed the info on.

While the idiots forced the delay, demanding that Burtzev "kill himself", Azef made his escape to Germany. Burtzev was pissed. He had to reveal one of his most valuable sources. Kropotkin was on the tribunal, but he wasn't as aggressive as the SR judges. Later K expressed his great gratitude for Burtzev's work. Which all goes to show that the worst people in the world to be judges on a tribunal are Russians. But more seriously it shows what happens when the romance of conspiracy overcomes common sense. Looking at it from the other side it's a great demonstration of how the best laid plans can blow up in your face. 




 Don't forget to factor in airfare and hotel in a projected budget. And, of course, bribes. Lots of bribes. 




 I don't think 'bathsalts' are a big thing in Ecuador. 




 No, it appears to be all drugs. Don't forget that Ecuador has been the victim of the US war on ~~drugs~~ peasants for decades now. Think cocaine, a dirt poor peasant and a US piloted plane passing overhead. If the peasant is lucky and he has paid the proper bribes he might not just live but even keep his crops. 




 I'm not too sure. I haven't seen any numbers, but if European experience is anything to judge by they will indeed decrease. 




 One can only hope that the US pressure will decrease for one reason or the other. 




 Muy bueno por Ecuador. 




 Thanks for the info. 




 I may be wrong on this, but I believe Uruguay legalized only marijuana. I understand that Portugal has legalized 'possession' of any drug across the board.  




 I believe that the use of a pesticide has to be approved in a 'crop by crop' manner. No doubt what you are saying about tobacco is correct, but this is a matter of regulation and bureaucratic rules.  




 I guess you're right on that. Good point. 




 For an introduction to the anarchist side of things see [An Anarchist FAQ](http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/index.html) . 




 Thanks. I was going on only the trail from the Physics World article. 




 No connection to the UAW that I know of. The [federation/alliance](http://www.industriall-union.org) was founded in June 2012 by four international unions. Since then it has grown a lot. In the USA the USW are an affiliate. The USW have been doing a few international things in the last few years. Aside from IndustriALL they are a component of Workers Uniting along with British unions. They are also allied with the Mondragon federation in the [1worker1vote](http://1worker1vote.org) organization to promote workers' cooperatives.  




 Yes, that can be the best thing to do in some cases. I often do that, but in this case the original paper is behind a paywall. I use the original when the full paper is open source. Otherwise I tend to stick to the title in the secondary source, in this case Physics World. 




 ??? 




 It all comes down to who gets to define what the "foundations of Islam" are.  




 Yes, I'm sure the pictures will become more and more informative as the craft gets closer to Pluto. 




 Here are three good books that can help you out and direct you an endless wealth of other sources:

1)The first three volumes of E.H. Carr's 14 volume history of the Soviet Union. These deal with the period you are interested in, and Carr regularly devotes a section on finance within each time period he is describing. Impeccably researched and documented.

2)Alex Nove's 'An Economic History of the USSR'. A less enjoyable read than Carr mostly because of a narrower focus, but in some ways more detailed and useful than Carr.*IMPORTANT POINT - I checked, and to my amazement the book is available on the internet at Google Books.* Carr's history would be available at University libraries, but only the best would have all 14 volumes.

3)Samuel Farber's 'Before Stalinism: The Rise and Fall of Soviet Democracy'. Well written but has less about your particular interest than the other two. Written from a non-Leninist Marxist point of view, and the author's main concern is political ie how Soviet democracy could have been preserved if various factions had made the right choices. 




 There's cold, and then there's *really* cold. It does make me wonder, however, what they could be made of. 




 This is a really good presentation. Thanks. 




 Maintenance in Antarctic conditions must be quite the feat as well. 




 Or whoever owns that robot. 




 From the point of view of the business owners it's the furthest thing from a 'failure'. 




 Those are interesting numbers. 




 It could also fit in as a measure of how many jobs have been lost in some situations. 




 Yes, but in pretty well every existing society things like 'comfort', 'time' and *opportunity* 'to pursue more interesting activities' are as unequally distributed as economic resources are. In fact they are often very much the same thing. OK, that's *now*. Should technological advances destroy jobs history is pretty clear on what happens. Opportunities are *not* equally distributed, and the benefit of the technology goes to a few while for others they get nothing or their situation deteriorates. 

In no way does this mean that technological advance should be stopped; it's just that it has to be looked at in its context, both historical, economic and social. 




 In one way it was a British equivalent of continental anarchosyndicalism. It believed that the economy should be democratically controlled by 'guilds' that were both a throwback to medieval guilds and also the equivalent of continental syndicates. It differed from continental anarchosyndicalism in several ways. One is that it saw a continued need for a state, for government. Another difference is that it was thoroughly non-revolutionary, advocating a gradual transition to a democratic society facilitated by elected politicians. Finally it was never a mass movement like continental anarchosyndicalism was. Continental anarchosyndicalism was perhaps the most authentically 'proletarian' movement that history has ever produced. British Guild Socialism in contrast was more of an intellectual movement even though it had its sympathizers amongst the working class. The guild socialists relied much more on 'converting people of good will' than on anything resembling the union organization of continental anarchosyndicalism. 




 All that I can say to that is that it takes a great deal of semi-religious faith to assign the word 'smart' to a phone. Maybe some people have truly genius rocks in their back yard. But yes, I know people are easily indoctrinated, but this weakness isn't infinite.  




 As an older person I can say that people of my generation would find that 'repulsive'. Interacting with the waiter(ess) is one of the pleasures of dining out. I hope that younger people will also feel that this is taking robotic impersonality to a ridiculous level. 




 I see. Various articles on different subjects on Wikipedia have different styles. It is, after all, user generated. I've never really thought much about the different writing styles there. 




 What are you referring to ? I can see a few grammar quibbles . For instance the "however" in the third sentence shouldn't lead off the sentence. The "-" in the second sentence would traditionally have been a semicolon. I must admit, however, that I also use "-" or a full colon instead of the correct semicolon. In the third sentence the more common term is "wholefoods" rather than "wholefood", but the second is probably acceptable. In sentence 3 there should be a comma in front of the "and". In the last sentence I personally would have left out the comma after the date, but I *think* this is still acceptable. It also is unclear because the author left out what the "170" modifies. Once more, however, the meaning is clear even if clumsy. 

You are probably referring to something more than this as being "weird", but I am uncertain what you are speaking of. 




 As the Luddites realized long ago. 




 In terms of the historical roots (French mutualism which created France's labor movement and later anarchosyndicalism and even the American individualist anarchists such as Tucker, Spooner, Labadie, etc.) it is obviously a 'socialism'. If you want to look at mutualists who self-define as socialists they put forward their own point of view in places like C4SS (Center for a stateless society). 




 Most of the research done has been trying to dice out certain factors from a complex situation. Very few real life situations are simple one factor changes. When the research is done, with the aid of truly heroic statistics, the most outstanding factor that regularly comes up is simple demographics. The higher the percentage of males from say 18 to 25 in the population the higher the crime rate.

New York would be an interesting study because it did indeed have a reduction in crime during a certain period. Those who wish to increase budgets say that this was due to the 'no-tolerance', 'broken window' policy put in place by the Major of the time. The reality is that there are *many* contributing factors, and the best that can be done is to assign a percentage with uncertainty to each factor. One of the biggest problem I can see with New York is choosing an appropriate control ie a comparable city. Most of the research that has been done takes national rates as a control, and that has difficulties. 




 To paraphrase Orwell, "some opportunities are more equal than others". 




 Oh no. I assume the coloring book comes with its on supply of disappearing ink in all the colors. 




 Well done. I like your comeback. The physician involved must have been really old fashioned. 




 I'm afraid that the selling price is unknown at this time. 




 Gracias compaero zeabu.  En beneficio de las victimas del sistema excolar Americano proporciono un resumen Ingls. Los EE.UU es el major ejamlo de un pais de habla Ingls que Deben saber Espaol.Pero la ignorancia es el objetivo de las escuelas Americanos.

Pot favor me corrija si usted piensa mi resumen es incorrecto. La filosofa no es mi puento fuerta.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

A summary of the article  above appears below. I don't have the time for a full translation at this moment. 

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

This article is from the Spanish language 'Philosophy Web', and it deals with a subject that actually may be more relevant in  English speaking countries, especially the USA, than it is in Spain or Latin America. The basic argument is against philosophical relativism. The most outstanding example of this is 'post modernism' in the USA which is being exported along with other industrial waste to the rest of the world. I will try in this summary to bracket my own opinions with an '[]', but I am sure that such may leak through to the summary. 

The title of the article translates as "I don't give a shit for your opinion'. It discusses a linguistic divide between opinion and its increasing promotion as opposed to 'fact'. [This is quite relevant in the present situation where 'post-modernism' holds sway in the university classrooms of soon to be retired (I hope)  American academics. This intellectual fad has spread outside of the USA. Hence this article from Spain. It also reminds me, to my discomfort, of the predictions of Russian sociologist Pitirim Sorokin who predicted an oncoming 'Age of Belief' that would supersede  an "Age of Empiricism'. While not willing to buy into Sorokin's determinism this may be an apt description of what has been happening in some regards.]

The author begins by tracing two concepts back to their Greek words. These are 'doxa' which may translate as 'opinion', 'common sense' or 'uniformed observation'. The other pole is 'episteme' which may translate as 'science' or 'informed statement'. The difference is between 'appearance' and 'reality'.

The essay goes on to how informed views are being discredited in favor of 'opinion'/doxa. The first stage of this process is a [propaganda] effort to maintain that there is 'no difference' between the two ways of viewing the world. This advances into the idea that both ways are 'equal' and that the difference between the two is a  matter of 'taste'.

One of the most important aspects of 'science' is that it is being continually being refined. The author contrasts this to the situation of 'opinion' where there is no mechanism for improvement, and he/she goes on to describe a situation, that of a bank loan, of how the two ways of seeing produce different actions. [The 'opinion' option, of course, may lead to bankruptcy if the bank persists in its folly].

The essay goes on to discuss 'relativism' which in effect denies an external reality, saying that all opinions are equal. [This, of course, is the venerable argument in philosophy between idealism and materialism]. What the media do is present the "stupidity of eqidistance' [from reality], and it uses the example of evolution/creationism as an example. Two sides of an argument are presented outside of any connection to reality that could allow judgement. In this context the 'debates' become 'set-ups'. [Entertainment rather than information.].

The author goes on to express the opinion that such debates become merely 'quantitative'. Right and wrong no longer exist. Simple weight of 'opinion' becomes more important than any way of differentiating between different points of view.

In such a situation no 'consensus' in the sense of a melding of different points of view in a 'dialectical' (non-Marxist sense) is possible. All that happens is an 'exhibitionism' of opinions where opinions no loner require evidence.

[In sum, in the Burt 'opinion', the essay is one more criticism of relativism, and it has political ramifications. I obviously agree because I am at heart a realist.]
 




 Thanks for the contribution. I tend to get a lot of news from South Korea, mostly from union federations and, of course, Labour Start. Korean workers tend to be very militant, and personally I think it is very much connected to the 'patronage' system of South Korean business. Trustification there seems to make Japan look like a truly competitive free market. So many labor disputes in Korea become political disputes almost automatically because the lines of patronage extend into the state as well to a greater degree than in other countries.

To my great disappointment I have found little in terms of *present* contacts with Korean anarchists. It seems to be all history. When the Asian Anarchist Network was really and truly operating posts from Korea were few and far between as well. I don't know what the problem is. Perhaps a more pervasive repression in terms of cowing people not with legal penalties but rather with the 'promise' of perpetual unemployment. But quite frankly I don't know. 




 Yeah, there are some of these do-gooder money machines that I have truly learned to hate over the years. PETA is one. Greenpeace (North American version) and Rainforest Action network are two others. Here's what happens. A local struggle begins. One of the leaches finds out about it. They sent a small contingent of travelling 'suckers' (or leftist bureaucrats on the make) to said locality and proceed to publicize the local struggle as a **fund raising opportunity** across the internet. The process actually predates the internet. Consider Newfoundland and the early NWT before Nunavut.  The people they send are 'weird' from the point of view of the locals *including the locals who started the campaign*. The invaders become a matter of embarrassment for local people, and, miracle of miracles, the whole community is united in hatred of the 'invaders'. Meanwhile the 'other side' uses the 'professional activists' as propaganda against their local opposition. Net result: five points down for the local opposition.

I'm most familiar with this in relation to Greenpeace. Their latest invasion involves a small community in Nunavut fighting against gas/oil exploration. I'm also quite familiar with the way that Rainforest Action Network parasitized the struggle of the Grassy Narrows people in Northwest Ontario. There are many other instances. I just tend to remember some.

PETA is in a class by itself. They can invade situations where there is no organized local struggle, appear, disappear and leave nothing but embarrassment and an increase in their bank account. They did this trick in Detroit during the water cut-off struggle. They parasitized a struggle that had nothing whatsoever to do with their supposed goals (besides making money of course). Besides embarrassing people in Detroit they contributed absolutely nothing, sweet bugger all, to the struggle to prevent the cut-offs.

OK enough emotion. It's not good for an old fart. I'm sure that there are other parasites besides the three I've mentioned above.  




 The subjective experience ? Yes, possibly. 




 Well I once more would say they are the same thing. As air molecules move past and touch the surface of the object some of the kinetic energy of the object is transferred to them as well. The difference between this and molecules directly in front of the object is that only part of the energy is transferred by the contact. 




 Oh God. A song with the lyrics "let the love flow" just popped into my mind.  




 They are sort of the same thing. Take the kinetic energy of the object just before it hits the air (assume a discrete boundary). As it descends it 'compresses' the air in front of it thereby changing kinetic energy into thermal energy of the air molecules. At the same time the air molecules exert an equal and opposite force on the object thereby slowing it down. This is the 'friction' referred to. The energy transferred to the air molecules is equal to that exerted on the object. 




 I'll try. As I said it may be dated. It's an idea that I've carried around in my head for over 25 years. 




 Good. Please do. 




 I guess that's true. It sure, however, has entered the language as a metaphor..."the road to Damascus". 




 Good question. Do spiders have the subjective experience of pain that we (and probably most vertebrates) have ? That's a bit beyond my knowledge. 




 Thanks. 




 There was at least one Greek philosopher who held to a sun centred cosmos. During the Renaissance Galileo escaped the death penalty. Copernicus escaped it by being dead already - his book was published posthumously. I think the heliocentric model was 'one' of the reasons why Giordano Bruno was killed, but I am not 100% sure on that. 




 China: 1)Incredible diversity, unappreciated by the outside world. 2)Oldest (more or less) continuous civilization. Stuff to see. 3)Rapidly changing and therefore interesting. 4)Soon to be the most important country in the world. 5)Interest in Pinyin (official national language). 6)Reportedly very hospitable country. 7)At least in the usual urban area I will personally be the biggest threat to the water quality. 




 Thank you. That seemed like a very informative article. 




 Yes, this guy wins some sort of 'nasty award'. 




 That's interesting. I'm going to have to try and compare them myself. 




 You're welcome. I've read several things over the years about 'muscle supplements' and liver failure, but I can't remember right now which compounds were involved. I'll have a look. Thanks for the comment. 




 You're probably right about that. 




 Thank you. 




 Thanks. 




 Yes, that's true. The thing is, however, that payment due is not an asset. When a private company declares bankruptcy the secured creditors will have their claims (payment due) compensated, at least in part, by funds raised by liquidation of the company's assets. Wages due (claims due) have a lesser priority than other debts do. I don't know how this works with a public entity such as a city. 




 Thanks for the information. I've actually given little thought to the subject of what influence small newspapers have. There are several in the city where I live, and I know that they are often good platforms for commercial advertising, and they may be useful for politicos as well. Thanks. It's food for thought. 




 Well, he's clear if nothing else. One thing I am unclear about in bankruptcy law. Secure creditors get first claim on assets, and wages owing are usually not in that category. I wonder how pension funds rank in the lineup. I imagine it is complicated. What assets do cities have that would be of any value to a pension fund ? 




 Well, there have been numerous epidemiological studies of the effects of economic conditions on mental health problems and yes, depression increases with decreased job security. There are also others studies, once more many, of the health effects of social class, including mental health. I'll see if I can dig up a good overview. 




 Will do. I've seen this sort of problem before, and usually is quite innocent as in somebody not properly undating (or adding) the security certificate for a site or a part of a site. Still, it's not always innocent. 




 I thank you profoundly for the great link. I was unaware of the Cornell project, and the site is fascinating. I signed up for some of the newsletters immediately. I see that their bird count (on May 9) is separate from the long running Christmas bird count. If you are connected to the project please note that when trying to access the count project from the link list at the bottom of the screen that it gives a 'security warning'. It is probably totally innocent, but I've learned to pay attention to these warnings and not proceed any further. Too bad. If you are not connected with Cornell please inform me, and I will try to email them myself about the problem. 




 Indeed. Humans as a group can be tremendously short-sighted. Sometimes it reaches the point of deliberate, malevolent attempts to retain ignorance. Think of politicians in the USA representing coastal communities and their attempts to deny climate change (South Carolina).

This incident also brought the 2009 Aquila earthquake to mind, and the court case that dragged on and on about it. I believe the accused involved have finally been vindicated. Earthquake prediction is a chancy affair, but sensible recommendations are often lost in bureaucracy. The circumstances are different, but there are relevant issues connecting both events (and other disasters). 




 That's been a long standing problem, and there have been numerous attempts to frame legislation to prevent it. None of these laws has yet solved the larger problem. Here's an interesting fact which may be dated but still has relevance. The side effects that you may see on labels, inserts and pharmacists' handouts are **95%** discovered via independent reporting by physicians, veterinarians, pharmacists, etc. The drug companies own reportage accounts for only one in twenty of the cautions. 




 It's interesting to think that the original objects were discovered and named by an amateur astronomer in a citizen science project. Not all science operates with huge budgets and bureaucracy. 




 From what I have read Muhammad was influenced by both Judaism and Christianity. I don't really know how much of each comes through in Islam. 




 Alternative futures. Would Islam have come into being without Christianity ? The classical Greco-Roman pantheon was pretty much past its best before date by the time Christianity rose to popularity. Would another of the mystery religions have served the same functions as Christianity ? 




 Thanks for the info. 




 Thank you. 




 Yes you are correct. I should have left the title alone rather than 'jazzing it up'. 




 No problem. It's something like hearing that 'Bill Jones' will be addressing the Chamber of Commerce annual meeting on the weekend. If you Google 'Bill Jones' you may find that a year ago he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Then you look at the phone book to get a visual on the problem. 




 The report comes from the United States Geological Survey, an organization that I don't think anyone could accuse of being unscientific. 




 Two things you should pay attention to in the references you provided. One is the history of the Energy Foundation China. It seems that this organization founded in 1999 (16 years ago) seems credible to not just the Chinese government but also to several US foundations who fund it. Also have a close look at a photograph of one Eric Heinz receiving an award from the Chinese government, last September I believe. Study that photo.

Now go to the cv of M. Heinz (French extraction now doing a post-doc in Germany). Look at his photo. Different person. Now examine the cv that M. Heinz provides. There's a lot of things there. One is that, if I presume M. Heinz spent the usual 10 years in getting his PhD then he would have been all of 14 years old at the time when he was a 'founder' of the Foundation as claimed by the Foundation's website. Now look at the cv once more. M. Heinz is a *computer graphics* specialist with no connection to anything remotely connected to energy or conservation. There is also **no** mention of the Foundation and indeed no indication that he has ever set foot off the European continent.

How did you confuse these two utterly different people who just happen to share the same name ? 




 I highly recommend subscribing to that site. Some may find it too 'popular science', but in my opinion it sometimes can be as good as Scientific American. 




 Yes, that's a good and striking presentation. 




 The Longshoremen have long been one of the unions with the broadest world outlook, and this is true to the tradition. What I don't see, however, is the duration of the strike. One hour ? Three ? Eight ? A full 24 ? 




 I wonder if there is some pun hidden in the name La Gordissima and the El Gordo lottery ? 




 Young, fresh and full of new ideas. Isn't it true that the 'peak years' in many fields occur earlier than people might suspect ? 




 No disagreement, but the use of the word "dissipate" brought a smile to my face. 




 But that's a 'forecast' rather than a report. A graph there shows positive GDP growth in the first quarter - not 'outstanding' but at least positive. No doubt the 'recovery' wasn't all it was cracked out to be in many ways. I'll agree with you on that. 




 Thank you. I've started to go through the various links, and it will take me some time to put it all together in my mind. 




 That's an interesting and perhaps troubling point of view, and I'm going to have to look further at it. One minor thing though, not the central point of your comment. I disagree that reduction of carbon emissions automatically means lower economic growth - even though energy consumption per capita is often used as equivalent to GDP per capita. Take say an increase in the production of solar panels which (hopefully) leads to lower carbon emissions. This increase is in fact economic growth not its opposite. Take, for instance, the growth in electric vehicles which (again hopefully) leads to lower carbon emissions. This may be any of three options, growth, decreased growth or no effect. The list could go on and on. 




 That's unfortunately a problem with *all* research that is scientific in nature ie reports confidence levels. In reality there is always uncertainty. It isn't restricted to demographic estimates. You will see the same thing in such 'hard' subjects as physics. The 'weight' of the electron, the magnitude of the fine structure constant, the speed of light, and so on and so forth. All of these have the old 'plus or minus' a given number of standard deviations when they are reported. It's the uncertain nature of an uncertain world. 




 Even better. Without janitors they'll have to pick up after themselves. *A collective cheer comes up from the long-suffering mothers of politicians*. 




 I'll have to try and look that up. Thanks. 




 The article that I recently read (see previous comment) is 'Climate Change and the Permafrost Carbon Feedback', Nature April 9. I hope the following [link](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v520/n7546/full/nature14338.html) will take you to the open access article. I sometimes have a problem with articles from the Nature Group being visible to me (I'm a subscriber) but not to others. Get back to me if there is a problem with the link.

In any case the major thrust of the article is that their models say that the carbon release from permafrost will be slow and gradual rather than fast and precipitous. I hope so. 




 That's what some may say. That opinion becomes more and more common the higher up you go in the ruling class. What I find encouraging, however, is that China *is* changing. The feminists are joining labor, environmental, human rights and literary activists, and more news gets out than in years past. I try to take an optimistic view of it. 




 I think you're right about the first statement, but I'm not 100% sure. I know nothing about the unemployment rates at various times, but I would imagine that they would have been highest right after the American invasion. 




 Yes it would be a positive feedback situation indeed. I think the uncertainty relates to the speed of release. I was recently reading about how new research suggests that the release would be slower than once thought. I'll try to dig up that article. 




 Thank you for the information. To me it's fascinating that RNAs in general are now such a rich field of research and even therapy. 




 Oops. Almost forgot to mention that English demands that the first word of *every* sentence be capitalized, not one out of three. My excuse is that that is punctuation not grammar. I still get a good mark in grade 3 English composition. 




 Grammar notes:

1)When using an equational sentence do *not* use a noun as the subject and an adjective as the object unless you mean to say that the adjective is a characteristic of the subject. 'Equality' is correct. 'Egalitarian' is not. Add the 'ism' to the adjective 'egalitarian'.

2)The proper contraction of 'It is' is 'it's' not 'its'. Its is the possessive of the neuter pronoun it.

3)Remember that prepositions are often necessary to make a sentence intelligible. Put the preposition 'of' in front of the neologism 'masculism'. 

4)Remember that the verbal noun in English is formed from the adjective when it isn't formed from the verb itself. The proper verbal noun should be 'masculinism' rather than 'masculism' as the conversion of feminine to feminism demonstrates.

Yes, I *think* about it. I *think* that I am grateful that I'm not caught in a confused mind game of opposing one abstraction to another and thinking it means something. I'm grateful that I can look at actual empirical reality and use language for describing such and suggesting *real* changes rather than playing at philosophy. 




 Oh shit. I'm sorry. I forgot that whether a Nature publication article may be accessible to me as a subscriber it isn't necessarily so to others. Let's try the following: go to a popular science article in New Scientist (something like a British Scientific American) on this research. Use my posting history to find it if need be. See the article there that allows you to 'click through' to the article in Nature magazine. If you can't reach it that way please get back to me. I tend to alternate between laypersons' sources and the scientific literature itself depending on the character of the subreddit I am posting to. 




 It depends what you mean by "allowed". Am I going to interrupt taking a good shit when the 'Batsignal'  says an ancap has posted, run to the computer with my pants around my ankles, take an epileptic fit and ban some commentator because they are not 'pure' enough, yell a bunch of rhetoric that was old when I was young and feel self-satisfied that I have 'done something' ? No ! Obviously ! 

Why no ? It's far less to do with politics than with the fact that I was already a mature adult at the time when the average redditer's grandmothers gave birth to their parents. I have no illusions about the *grand importance* of the internet. I have no identity crisis to work out. I also have 'nothing to prove'. Adolescence  is long past. Quite frankly the competitions of various groups to attack and counterattack on the internet seems more than slightly childish to me. The ambition to be top gunslinger in an imaginary Dodge City has no attraction for me. 

I'm tempted to pull the 'non-American' card out of the deck. This sub will hopefully concentrate on the anarchist movement *beyond the borders of the United States* as was stated in the intro above. The so-called 'ancaps' are one of the 'deviations' (to use an old commie word) that are incredibly unimportant the further you get from the Red, White and Blue. See the 99% number mentioned above. Exclude strange American stuff and that basically takes care of the ancaps in their 99%. Along with things like Maoist political correctness disguised as anarchism, silly dreams about the end of civilization and, to a lesser extent, the making of terrorism out to be an 'ideology' (which, of course, has a large component of zombie Maoism to it as well). 

Personally the great majority of what I see from ancaps strikes me as a 'philosophy fad'. How many syllogisms can dance on the head of a pin. The American political equivalent of Thomist philosophy/theology. What is done is to take a few unexamined axioms and start deducing things *without any reference to the real world* - producing a *great ergo*. That's all fine and good for sophomore philosophy majors, but it is a howling emptiness out here. 

This wasn't always the case. Let's go back to those maternity days of redditers' grandmothers. Take the period 1968 to 1972 for example as the New Left was spiralling towards the Maoist snakepit. At that time people like Karl Hess, Jerome Tucille and even Murray Rothbard in one of his earlier disguises were all gung ho for a right-left alliance, and there were issues at the time that were opportune for such an alliance. Those issues are no longer of any great importance.

The players, however, were quite different. On the right the 'paleocons' were much more of a factor than they are now. Nowadays the religious right is an incredibly more important factor they were then. On the left, confused as it was, the 'New Left' was a *much* more important factor than American anarchism is today, not that American anarchism doesn't deserve the adjective 'confused' as well. Take a broad estimate of how 'popular' anarchism is in the USA today, including all variant definitions of it. Got a number ? Multiply that by another than ranges somewhere between 100 and 1,000. I have my own crude estimate which is about 1 in 7,000. So, for every vague anarchist today there would be between 70 and 700 vague New Leftists. It's a different world.

I have my own ideas of where this sub should go. Perhaps I didn't make them plain enough in the introduction beyond the fact that what anarchists are doing and thinking in other countries can stand as a corrective example to the problems of North American anarchism, bringing it 'back to its roots' as you will. 

Once more I run on at the mouth. I'll close with the fact that I recognize the *unimportance* of the ancaps and see little benefit in playing mudpie throw with them. Just like the fact that I think online diy pop psychotherapy disguised as 'anarchism' is ridiculous and is not any sort of 'anarchism' worth promoting. Similarly airy philosophy debates - the ancaps - are not a valuable use of time. 

To use a couple of old metaphors, one of which was probably not current amongst urban people when it was popular out in the boonies; "The 'usefulness' of some things that pass as 'anarchism' in today's USA makes tits on a boar look like a Swiss army knife. 




 Can you elaborate ? 




       ? Honest to Christ there is nothing about this to be concerned about. If this ever gets out of the house of wild dreams don't forget that it will be built  by the Russian government and Russian workers and then operated by Russians. Actually Russians are very nice people, and they can accomplish miracles - *providing nobody is foolish enough to plan the miracle*. If Stalin hadn't had a nervous breakdown when the Germans invaded the troops on the front would never have made the miraculous chaotic withdrawal they did, and Germany would have won WW2. To quote Chekov from Star Trek, "Russia inwented bullshit".  




 That happens to be the criteria that many anarchosyndicalist unions have adopted, and some such as the CNT-E made and make an effort to have as few paid staff as possible. That, however, seems to be something quite separate from the question of whether paid staff of *another* union can sign up in the IWW. The matter of staff salaries is something that has to be decided in said *other* union, not in another one such as the IWW that works on dual card principles. It's definitely a good recommendation for any union, but it is quite separate from the question of IWW membership. 

I doubt that any of the hugely overpaid executives of various business unions are panting at the door to take out IWW membership so the grossest possible example is moot. As to the lowly pen pushers, door knockers, flac runners, etc. it might be an idea to qualify their eligibility by income, but that becomes so complex that I don't think it is realistic. 




 Glad to have you onboard zeabu. Yes, it will be a great deal of work as I'm finding out, but I hope it will be worthwhile. You raised so many issues with your post, and I can't deal with all of them at once. Let's look at the first one you mentioned, the eternal and unrelenting posturing about violence towards the police in r/anarchism (and other places). It often seems like this is the *one and only* thing that ties the people that frequent such internet boards together. That and not saying 'bad words'. And, of course, a few other selected 'enemies'. All moral questions such as the compatibility of this sort of rhetoric with what anarchism is all about aside there are some practical problems with it that deserve attention.

Let's start with the aura of juvenile 'snottishness' that it casts on the movement. Most people reading such things would assume that the authors were either uncontrolled thugs - or much more likely - bratty 15 year olds showing off how rebellious they are. It creates a situation where the illusion of 'internet tough guy' becomes some sort of weird *principle*. It's mere showing off, and it paints anarchism as a phase of childish rebellion that people who become adults outgrow. Personally I want to present the ideology/ideals as a reasonable proposition that rational adults might want to consider. 

There's another observation that people may and possibly usually draw from seeing the high volume rhetoric. That is the pretentious show-off nature it presents. Fake, fake, fake and fake. That may be an even worse image to present than being thuggish. The violent claims are wildly out of touch with anything that is even remotely possible.

Police tasked with monitoring this sort of thing know that very well. If they were under some delusion that the nonsense was imminent and actually meant - well they would put a rapid end to it. It also, however, provides other benefits to those it is supposedly directed against.

First of all information gathering. It's very nice to have lists of people that *might* in some unlikely future actually pose some sort of threat. Such lists can be used should 'sting operations' be considered to produce a news story that can be 'evidence' of the need for increased surveillance budgets. It can also be used as part of evidence in court where the actual charges are considerably less than the wild internet fantasies. It can be further used as leverage for blackmail should a law enforcement agency wish to recruit informers for more in real life situations. Useful, useful, useful. One of the things I find almost amusing is that the rhetoric spouters often assume that they have some miraculous ways of hiding their real identities from surveillance. Really ! In their imagination they think they can play in a league that only other large governments can do.

The violent rhetoric provides a 'badge of identity' that some think can serve as 'proof' of their 'sincerity', 'commitment', 'bravery' or even in a bizarre inversion of reality as proof of 'advanced political ideas'. In actual fact it is an illusionary substitute for the real commitment of examining reality and trying to devise realistic ways of changing it. Put briefly, it prevents thought. In some cases thinking or learning are the exact opposite of what some people want to do.

Using violent rhetoric that is popular in certain small and shrinking subcultures easily becomes a way of avoiding learning about what a subject such as anarchism actually is and trying to imagine ways of making it realistic and workable, recognizing the problems with that. Anarchism is like any other human endeavor. It is incomplete and has difficulties. You may have noticed that many of the dogmatic guardians of the absolute truth of *their* version of anarchism actually know almost nothing about its reality, philosophical or historical. As long as shooting off one's mouth remains their major activity they never will learn much. 

This getting too long. One thing I'll close on. Hypocrisy is a character flaw that draws almost universal condemnation. It is emotional rather than rational, but the examples of long standing advocates of foolish actions who remain year after year, sometimes decade after decade, immune from the consequences of what they call *others to do* is disturbing. Having being an anarchist for decades I have had more than ample opportunity to observe such 'heroes'.  




 No problem. It certainly seemed related to genetics to me. 




 In the English language 'myth' can be used in a number of different ways, each of them with a set of different connotations. There are other words like this such as the word "theory". In the way the author uses the word it carries the connotation of 'wrong'. Others may use the word 'myth' in different ways such 'widely known story that gives meaning/justification to present social practices'. It may even mean a story that everyone knows is untrue but is widely known and appreciated because of some aesthetic appreciation. There are no doubt other usages that escape me at the moment.

The way the author uses the word is as follows. He takes Smith's speculations about a human propensity to specialize in the production of a certain item or services and says that Smith believed that this was a universal human characteristic. He then says that said products or services will naturally give rise to a 'market' where a surplus will be produced and said surplus will be exchanged for other items or services due to a 'human nature' that naturally gives rise to such a thing.

What the author is saying is that this anthropological speculation is taken as a axiom by most economists, an assumption that they do not question because it is 'self-evidently true'. The author further claims that the actual facts of anthropological study of various 'economies' do not support this axiom/myth/assumption. That is his argument. He makes the comparison to Sorel's idea of the 'myth of the general strike' that gave meaning to the activities of early syndicalists.

There are various points where one may argue with the author, but he does use the word in one of its accepted usages. 




 Time for a little geography lesson here. The article mentions a range of 7,000 km. Now suppose you put the fleet in the enclave of Kaliningrad, a crazy thing to do granted but not outside the range of possibilities for a Russian government of any sort. Now suppose there's big trouble on the Amur and Russia wants to airlift the troops to Vladivostok. They'll barely make it. St Petersburg to Vladivostok is about 6,000 km. They'll be running on vapour at the end. Suppose, on the other hand they want to face off Americans instead of Chinese. From Kaliningrad to the last Russian island in the Bering Sea is 9320 km. Well, they'll get past Lake Baikal, but somewhere over Yakutsk - down they go. If you go west instead of east the fleet would make Britain, but somewhere over the Atlantic....blub ! Could it reach Egypt ? Yes. South Africa ? I'd have to look.

"Anywhere in the world" is a gross overstatement. 




 Yes, the two exemptions have to be harmonized in some way. I think that the two clauses would be better than trying to fiddle with the unpaid or underpaid officials part. I haven't seen the part about the political party officers and officials. I'll try and find it. 




 I'm afraid that's easier said than done. 




 'Asshole', 'plumbing', 'bullshit': It all fits together. 




 The authors of the paper describe the implications of their work in veterinary and human medicine. Perhaps I made a poor job of saying that with my modification of the title. So I`ll expand. 

The authors looked at an uncommon inherited neurodegenerative disease in dogs. They traced this disease to a missense error in the ATG4D gene which encodes a protease involved in autophagy. They speculate that their work may point the way to investigation of inherited human neurodegenerative diseases of presently unknown etiology. They also speculate that their canine model may be useful in designing and testing therapy for such diseases if they are due to errors similar to that found in these dogs. It also has veterinary application. 

I hope this answers your question. 




 I see your point, and I remember that news now. I had instances in mind where the two unions were non-IWW. The Fieldworks situation isn't exactly one of another union though it certainly seems to be in the same category. In the old days we would have called Fieldworks a 'front' and that would be all that needed saying. In the days of highly developed NGOs and quangos perhaps there should be a neologism. Instead of 'quango' (quasi non-governmental organizations) perhaps 'quanuo' (quasi non-union organizations) would be appropriate. 

Yes, the matter *should* be discussed at the branch level and the HQ informed. Perhaps there should be some standard questions to be asked in such cases. I have no idea of how you'd word a proposal that didn't simply forbid such organization efforts. Obviously the initiative should still remain confidential rather than public. I also think there should be a similar if less strict process in the case of general 'lefty fronts' rather than specific 'union fronts'. Think Sisters Camelot.

Definitely worth paying attention to.  




 Yes, anarchists can be highly moralistic at times, and the article perhaps dwelt on that. But as to your major point there have been many instances that I've seen where the staff of a union is represented by a totally different union, and labor disputes have occurred. I never dreamt I should keep count of such things over the years, but I am certain that I have seen more than 10. It's not like electing an atheist Pope. Personally I think the 'staff exemption' (unless a person is involved in hiring or firing ie is a manager) as it presently is should stand. It might be a missed opportunity at some time in the future. I'm undecided about your second point which, of course, follows from the first. Staffers are obviously the recipients of 'pay', substantial or otherwise.

Food for thought anyways. I'll try and get back to you on this. 




 No, I was just joking using cat breeds. I could have included Scottish (Fold) Gaelic and Egyptian (Mau) I guess. If you want to curse your cat, on the other hand, you have to speak in Russian Blue.  




 Two things about cats. One is that they only pay attention if you speak in Siamese or Persian. The second is that they *will* get revenge. But yes, it certainly does apply. In my opinion cats seem to be less trainable because they aren't 'pack animals' like dogs and humans. Not that they are antisocial. far from it as any owner of multiple cats can tell you. It's just that the motivation of "simply wanting to please" is less prominent in them than in dogs. 




 Very often the proper answer is *nothing*. I'd recommend *never* punishing unless the action has just happened in front of you. It just doesn't work. All it does is convince the dog that you are irrational. Here's a scenario that tells the story.


 Dogs can be intelligent enough to learn a great number of words in a human language. In the case of some border collies this may amount to hundreds. What they are totally deficient in is *grammar*. Let's take conditional and future tenses along with 'moods'. If you say, "If you shit on the rug I will kick you outside". The dog hears, "Shit...rug...outside". In their mind the word 'shit' may be either an indicative or an imperative mood verb. The conditional tense doesn't enter their mind. Neither does the future tense of "kick". What the dog does is go over to the rug, shits on it and then goes to the door to be let outside. From their point of view they are doing exactly what you want. Because so much human-dog talk is imperative the dog takes it as such. 




 I swear to God that you're the first commentator who hasn't come from one of the less accepting states. 




 How on Earth does the City justify an *18%* interest rate ? That's heading towards payday loan territory. 




 You get what you pay for, and in this case the lobbyists get the better part of the Congress. 




 That's true. Smith's work has been the subject of a lot of misinterpretation. Both works are available on the internet. 




 Well yes, that's a legitimate question. 




 Sounds more like the computer than the site. I hardly have the most up to date tech either. 




 It's the same way in all federal systems. The USA may be a little bit more 'states' rights' than other federal countries. 




 You're welcome. 




 Thanks for the link. 




 It`s interesting to note that the limitations of `hair analysis, in particular the `false positives' have been known in an academic way for a very long time. The problems with this evidence are well presented in most forensic science textbooks. I can assume that many of the wrongfully convicted were represented by public defenders who gave their cases less attention than it deserved *or* that the defense budget in these trails was so limited that calling expert witnesses to dispute the prosecution's 'evidence' was not an option.

There are similar, if not as glaring, problems with fingerprint evidence, and, of course, 'lie detector' tests are notoriously unreliable. In an issue of The Match a few years ago Fred Woodworth gave a good overview of the problems with fingerprints. 




 Yes, anthropology/archaeology can often be that way. It's like a Sherlock Holmes  story, making conclusions from what looks like scanty evidence. 




 Yes, I guess it's the old 'headline writers' dilemma'. You have to be attention grabbing to draw in readers, but it's very easy to stray into overstatement. 




 I guess it depends on both where you live, where you work and what has happened recently. Someone who has to commute to work over bad roads or poor train service will be more concerned than others about infrastructure. Similarly people who live in communities that have recently had problems will be more concerned than others - even if say the water treatment plant is overdue to collapse as in the next hour. I think (?) that Britain has less of a problem with an infrastructure debt than the USA does, but I might be wrong about that. 




 Just an interesting blog piece about how far dual unionism *should* go. 




 Great. It's very much appreciated.
