 A Siren with a blink ability like mages in wow. I think that could be fun if it was on a low cool down or had the potential to be with her skill tree 




 ATHENAAAA :D PLSSSSSSSSSSS 




 Could you do a Commandant Steele one? :DDDDDDD 




 any chance your friend can dupe me a wep and shield??? 




 so you're saying there are more to come? 




 im on PC unfortunately :( 




 im on PC and i did them on a lower level character because a high level friend helped me with the prove yourself mission 




 i'm ok with the grind i just dunno how to get my hands on a modded wep and shield . 




 A word of warning this is one hell of a grind, there are 3 arenas to beat, each with 20 rounds and each taking about 2 hours to complete, it's not for the faint hearted 




 yeah sure lets go :D thanks ^^ 




 I decided to get back into BL1 recently and have decided to get all the achievements, just for fun, however my lvl 61 roland save file seems to be corrupt or something, long story short, i leveled a siren, im now level 50 and have lost the will to live.

 However to get the achievement for killing Craw im gonna need to be level 61 or have someone carry me, so i was wondering if there are any kind souls out there willing to carry a level 50 noob to help me get the achievement? :P

 I want S S munitions to make a return 




 he asked which bosses could be farmed rapidly. Not what loot they drop... 




 Henry 




 we all know this...... doesnt mean the game inst going to ever happen. 




 "I'm an even better slut when i'm drunk"
 




 What does RNG mean? 




 Exactly why i dont spec into anarchy. Also cos i love using my infinity WAY too much 




 i'd rather no teleporting at all, and you have to ride your mount everywhere and face the challenges a long the way, it'd make the game longer and more challenging as well as adding to the RPG elements of the game and taking less away from the immersion  




 k 




 Mounts! Instead of the old catch a ride system i feel the ability to mount up at any time just like you can in WoW would be really awesome.

I feel like mounts like these could fit really well into the game and it offers more charater custimization if you give the player access to rare mount skins or just rare mounts etc.

 These are so awesome! Think i'll have to get the "my siren's name is brick" one :P

 can someone get me a code for my friend? says i cant get another one on the same IP and he's asleep right now, if anyone can help me out that's be awesome of you :D 









 that looks fucking dope. 




 poop.
 




 Anyone got a link to this unique TF build talk??? 




 What we really said when we all started: "That champ's OP!" 




 Master yi with feral flare here. Get on my level. 









 It says that vandal twitch is on sale: http://gyazo.com/25e2e09742e682d655ed6db51c3b5fe1
However when i view the "on sale" tab in the shop it says that gangsta twitch that's on sale, not vandal.

Im on EUW im not sure it this is the same for all servers. 




 You won! :) check your inbox 




 I can pay it off, it's no worries. Appreciate the concern though :) 




 Meh, i'd rather make someone happy. 




 I accidentally bought 1 too many game Keys for Reaper of souls (it put me in my overdraft and now im going to have to pay my bank a fortune .) anyways i figured i may as well brighten someone's day by giving away the key.

Just leave a comment and i'll randomly pick one of you guys :) Good luck!


EDIT: Jojobtz won! Thanks for entering guys, sorry i couldnt give you all one :/ 




 Im still waiting for an ARAM Team Builder, riot. 




 Really hope they fix the Zed ulti bug :/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UI3c3EY17o 




 Our clients all went black as soon as we got into champ select, anyone else had this problem? Now we get this :D http://i.gyazo.com/5ec486ee15fe51e096f570b8a3429ad2.png 




 i really feel like you shouldn't force us to pick what champion we'd like to play and instead allow us to just queue for the position we want so that it could be used for ranked draft pick. 




 I played 2 before i played 1 and i have to say it didn't really change much, i fell in love with BL2 and it was that that made me want to play BL1. The story is BL1 is SERIOUSLY BAD i learn almost nothing playing through the game and ended up googling most of it to piece the story together. So in conclusion play which ever you like first :) 




 Im down, add Fuzzy on steam :) 




 wouldnt this get me a VAC ban or something? is it legal basically? 




 Im sorry for your loss, i truly am :/ and yeah i agree the whole "it gets easier" shit people say is a bunch of bollocks, the highest suicide rates in america are white males above the age of 80 and people are saying it gets better!? That said I think you'll go far buddy, school was something i never did too well at, but keep studying hard if school is something you can deal with.
