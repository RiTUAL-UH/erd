 I see your bad sweaters and raise you this: http://imgur.com/cJ3Sc 




 This is Jefferton's finest family. 




 Yes, it was staged. We decided to break free of tradition this year with Christmas pictures. To give a sense of before and after: http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/c0.0.403.403/p403x403/12607_447747458619863_115113246_n.jpg -- What fun it was walking around Kmart to get to their photo studio though. 









 oh, usually saw that. was sorta in my own world after reading this... tnx 






























































































 Wow--haven't really heard of anyone using Future Point's Starlight anywhere and I talk to quite a few end users. Going to have to do some research and see how they're approaching unstructured data. Just curious (hey, you said you were bored haha), other than the scaling limits you've hit with Starlight or is that all?  




 Hi, all I meant by vanilla was the raw open source distribution of Apache Hadoop but from what it sounds like that wouldn't be a good fit for you anyway due to some of the overhead and need to just hop in and experiment.  









 "You need to understand computation" ... thanks for that.

I am talking about cost and feasibility here, not possibility.  




 Let's you and me revisit this thread in a few years ;) 









 It's that we reaching the Brick Wall of Moore's Law. There are only so many transistors we can pack on a chip and with those comes some serious power/cooling overhead that negates (by far) any savings on the hardware. 




 Maybe, but maybe not. There's the Moore's Law issue I cited a moment ago, and the cost of powering a system like this expected to increase. It's not feasible for anyone to own one of these unless you're a research institution (like DOE Nat'l lab--not hospitals). It was a cunning play from IBM to show the applicability of HPC technologies in everyday settings but it's far from practical. Unfortunately too--imagine what would be possible with a HAL treating us! ;) 




 I am curious about what made you guys choose InfoSphere Streams over vanilla Hadoop (complexity, learning curve, functionality) when from what I can tell this is the same core Hadoop framwork (down to the HDFS)... Just when you get time, know you're looking for an answer but I'm just curious.  




 I think that Watson's role as an instant "second opinion" from a "doctor" is going to bode well for medicine in general. The issue is that only the most advanced research hospitals (who already have the most outstanding researchers/medical pros) will be able to afford a system like this. Right now the IBM System Z line is more than many universities can afford--getting it into actual hospitals is going to require some hurdling over Moore's law--if you can afford the hardware, the power and cooling for this puppy will kill you. Could be many thousands to run this each month. 









 And they said R couldn't scale. Bah! 




 Okay, fair enough. I like yours better. 



















 Perhaps Iceland should understand this issue and offer a more attractive option to conduct business there on site but as it is, it's pretty expensive to do anything. And besides, not sure anyone (even the most hermit-inclined sys admin) wouldn't be willing to move there. 


































 Yes, imagine that. Doesn't usually happen that way. 



















 Great quote... "data science is a very fuzzy term, but what seems to unite a lot of people is that is theyve come from a lot of different directions and ended up in the same place. It almost feels like this crossroads where a lot of different disciplines actually meet and share and exchange tools and techniques and talk and collaborate." 




 Thank you for rewriting SnapLogic's PR for the enjoyment of all, PanderDaily. :) 




 Mortar actually seems like a pretty interesting service. Hadoop as a service itself is going to be the next wave of services in general--all enabled by AWS (because who really uses any other cloud), I just wonder how the message about such companies is going to resonate with actual users. It's hard to wrap a "sell" around that, especially for those who've already dumped a lot of money/time into teaching a team Hadoop or getting hooked in with a distro vendor. 












































 You know, I know better--and somehow, in my hurry to share it, speed got the best of me. This is a terrible error. Just terrible but it was up and I was off--forgive me!  




 Ha--awesome feedback, that! 


































 Great, well-written story 



















 It seemed for a while like they were keen on pushing some boundaries with their APU but NVIIDA and Intel so strong on the co-processor/discrete GPU front, why bother, I guess is what they thought. Thing is, AMD developed a great deal of this well in advance of Intel--they just do a pretty shitty job of marketing. 












































 They just updated it with full confirmation--China is now far, far above the rest of the world in terms of its supercomputing might. the Cray Titan system at Oak Ridge Lab is a rather distant second... http://www.hpcwire.com/hpcwire/2013-06-02/full_details_uncovered_on_chinese_top_supercomputer.html?featured=top 




 Xeon Phi is really only meant for the high performance computing (supercomputing) market. At least at this point. It's real push seems to be on its lower end Atom-like chips. 




 An update was just posted a few moments ago next to the older ones. The editors secured a special draft report directly from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and are expected to share full details about peak performance numbers (as confirmed) as well as full specs for benchmarks, application range, processor to coprocessor ratio, memory subsystem and ooo...the interconnect topology. Exciting stuff for the supercomputing world. They note they'll post this around 11 p.m. Eastern or midnight. 



















 Wow--that summary (and its companion alliteration) is a better title than any of the others kicked out there so far. 









 That is a wonderful smile--brought one to me today. 





























 That would be...unexpected. 




 Thanks for the explanation Big Pervert. 




 Agreed--I respect that argument and agree that there are some Christian scientists that are....science-y. Still not sure how they pick and choose what to believe based on faith and what to believe based on reality, but to each his or her own. Thanks for calling me on that because you are right. 




 Yes, it's sort of like going to Salt Lake City to drink and gamble, but nonetheless.. 




 I always shy away from CSM because of the name of the magazine, but honestly, they have some damn fine reporters that aren't all....christian-y. As counterintuitive as it may sound, their best reporting is often on science. Go figure. 





























 Baaaaa-dass. 









 It's hard to find things to give to friends that aren't sappy or generic. After searching for a while I decided that I could never express both humor and happiness with Hallmark junk. And so, yes. :) 









 My first thought upon seeing this... "Florida"
