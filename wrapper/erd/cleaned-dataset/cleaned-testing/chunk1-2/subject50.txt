 It's things like this that make me wish I'd not gone into bioengineering but rather something that involves space. 




 What about bodily waste? I assume they're minimizing that with TPN, but that has to be addressed. 




 I was really expecting that lake to be frozen and them skid across it, somehow magically upright 




 The Little Mouse, the Red Ripe Strawberry, and the Big Hungry Bear.

My brother had my parents read it so much he memorized it and then "read" it to me.  He's only 3 years older. 




 Even without owning it, can't purchase... :(

 My girlfriend wants me to wear a batman onesie in the winter to keep warm, is very emotionally stable, plays video games (the first thing she did when she got to work was tell me what the free Xbox game is this weekend) and drinks with me at kickball every week.  She's the best 




 Having a good friend who spent a year trying to find a job after getting a BS in Ag   Biosystems and then an MS in BME, probably not, go for the full PhD.  However, the BME program at my school has a habit of kicking out PhD students who are "under qualified," "problematic," or that they "just don't like" making the MS degree relatively worthless here.

On the bright side, my friend is now studying for a PhD with full funding in Barcelona, Spain.  

The best advice either of us would give you is to not do something too specific.  Do not pigeonhole yourself into a technique that is so specialized and useful in only one way that you're a grain of salt in a pile of sand looking for the other grain of salt. 




 can we call this one "pornographic Penny?" 




 I only wish I knew more people in person that understood this reference 




 Here's a copy of the article:

 Guess I'm watching Scarface for the first time ever tonight 




 They should use this book instead of the sex-ed course materials.  Students would learn something.  If not about sex, then about the world around them as an engineer sees it.

Though the students may be laughing too hard by the end to pay attention if they did learn the engineering parts. 




 In my experience as a Biosystems Engineering grad student, BME students just go to grad school and focus on microbiology or optics a lot more than anything you've talked about.  If you want to do prosthetics, find a professor at a different university and consider the field that his/her appointment is in (whether it's EE, ME, BME, etc).

The two things you mention are very different, so you may want to decide on smart prosthetics (going to be more EE and ME oriented) or the medical substances (probably more BME or material science engineering). 
























 Prosciutto pizza!?! That's pretty classy 




 How's the food there? 




 Just came across these recently and my molecular bio isn't as strong as it should be.  Seems like a new way to treat antibiotic resistant bacteria and other things like Marburg and muscular dystrophy.  How does it work  and why is it better than antibiotics? 




 If only the ISS would test this... 




 This is true. I've seen some truly messed up models as a result of humidity in the support and/or the model material while it's printing.  All you can do is get a new spool and reprint. 









 It'd be nice if they didn't have to use a laser to create the surface.  What I mean by this is that they have to post-process the material after the sheet is made which is going to add to the cost.  The process by which the metal is 'cast' does not produces this surface. 




 In my experience with 3D printed materials, the layers are not laid down perfectly flat on one another and there is a capillary force that pulls liquids through (this applies to FDM, I have no experience with other technologies).  It's possible that if the plastic was heated a little bit closer to being in a liquid state rather than closer to being in a solid state as it is laid down that this might solve the problem, but then things might get runny. 

Also that there is a scaffold interior instead of a solid material isn't going to help with the out gassing problem (I'm assuming you mean the gas in the interior of the part is coming out of the part not the material itself is off gassing). Perhaps if a part was printed solidly it would be less noticeable as the space would be filled with material. 




 How would you adapt today's technology towards medical applications that require sterilization either of bulk material or the final printed product such that they can be FDA approved? Are new materials that aren't currently printed with necessary or is something like PLA that is widely used capable to fill this void? 




 Do you mind some old PDFs from when I took a SolidWorks class?  

Also, check out www.vertanux1.com

I've been learning PTC Creo from him and he's been great.  Maybe check out the final/midterm for SolidWorks/Inventor (or whatever he has, I've been focused on Creo). 




 As a new Ohio resident looking for a corgi, where do I get one here? 




 As someone at the bar, where are you all? Found going away party, but no Snoo sign 




 So this seems to be kind of an odd problem that is currently driving me crazy.  Basically what happened is that my school (university) converted all student email accounts to the Gmail based ones that are great and last forever.  When I graduated, I was hired temporarily by my adviser while I hunted for a job.  Because of this, my email account was converted to a Microsoft Exchange account.  This means I log into an Outlook Web App to check my email instead of going through the Gmail login.  On my phone, I can't add the new account as an exchange account because it makes a duplicate.  Now I have to use multiple email clients on my phone despite there now being support for Exchange.

The reason I don't just delete the account now that I have a job and don't use it much is that I have all my purchases, subscription (All Access) and that sort of stuff tied to the old Gmail account that I used from my university.  

Is there any way to have the account on my phone, but get the Exchange emails (which may or may not go back to the Gmail account, no one seems able to tell me)?
