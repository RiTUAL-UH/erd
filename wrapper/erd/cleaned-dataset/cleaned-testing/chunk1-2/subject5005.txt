 If she was a White man who did this she would have been fired by now. That is all that anyone needs to know and the double standard shows you how the Left wing scum running the liberal arts institutions in America are taking over and they're winning because our media is garbage and won't call them out. News reports about this story aren't calling her out; they are merely reporting on the facts. When the media creates the narrative that people like this have been festering and taking over liberal arts departments in academia in the Western world for decades then I'll be satisfied.

 They should be kept out. Just because one kid in a video tugs at your heart strings doesn't mean we should accept any more third world immigrants into our Western countries. We accept enough immigrants as is.

Chris Kamara: "Well Jeff, you wouldn't have believed me a few years ago if I had told you that Sepp Blatter would be sitting in a federal court and sweating bullets. The scene here is truly as tense as it gets and there are certainly some squeaky bums in this courtroom today. Wait! Wait a minute, Jeff! They're bringing them out to read the verdict now.

 [The thread in /r/CFB about Manti T'eo's fake girlfriend](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/16pi4a/deadspin_manti_teos_dead_girlfriend_the_most/) being exposed might be one of my favorite reddit threads of all-time. The hilarity contained within those comment threads was truly astonishing. This guy's comment from the thread sums it up perfectly. 

 This comment will undoubtedly get buried but I feel compelled to voice my opinion nonetheless.

Watching this story break and unfold over the last hour in this comments thread is what I love MOST about the Reddit experience. From the initial link, to the ensuing denial from ND fans and Te'o supporters, the speculation, the reaction .gifs, and then the real time links to ND's statement - I have never had quite such an intriguing social networking experience in my almost 20 years of using the internet.

All credit goes to DeadSpin for breaking the story but I'll always remember reading these comments in real time as the story was breaking as a truly unparalleled experience in the ever developing social network medium.

   Instead, we have this choice/not choice debate, where by default they're conceding the ground that if it IS a choice, then it's wrong. Fuck that. If it's a choice, it's MY choice and keep the fuck out of it.

 How much is it genetic and how much is it psychological? Why do I get the feeling that you don't have the psychological aspect and feeling without the genetic aspect being apparent.  


































 So you can *feel* homosexual due to genetics but you're not a homosexual until you *act* on your homosexual desires that are wholly inspired by your genetics? Or do genetics play no role in homosexuality?

 Alright, alright, alright.  




 Cool. As long as its your tax dollars that pay for illegal immigrants to go to school while American citizens struggle to pay the costs of college and everything else then I'm alright with your delusional plan. Your tax dollars and money out of your pocket for non-Americans, not mine.  




 Yeah, but it bashes views that reddit feels are held by fat redneck Republicans so the stupid post stays and will frontpage. The wise teenage liberals of reddit probably are cool with ~~their tax dollars~~ their parents' tax dollars putting illegals through college when many American citizens - not illegal Hispanics - can't even afford college themselves and need to scrounge tirelessly for an education. Brilliant. Well done, wise teenage redditors who pay little to no taxes. Read the article and then reevaluate your delusional political beliefs.

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/nyregion/financial-aid-for-undocumented-students-no-longer-discussed-in-hushed-tones.html

When even the liberal commenters in the NY Times are outraged about illegal immigration then you really know how bad the situation has gotten.  




 You are the bravest redditor of the day for posting this may may attacking anti-science Republicans on reddit. You deserve a medal of honor for this may may. 









 I love how reddit's wise teenage liberals think that all of the illegal Hispanic immigrants pouring over our wide open borders are hardworking. Someone offer proof of this and I'll shut up and upvote this stupid cartoon. And no, the top comment and anecdote of this thread is not proof of anything. There are just as many criminal illegals and deadbeats pouring into these country for free shit as there are ones who work just as hard as you and your neighbor. We don't need these people here for anything. At all.

  The discussion quality on TiA has been horrendous. It's easily one of the biggest circle jerks on reddit.

The sub consists almost entirely of image posts because the mods don't allow self posts. I'm not sure what anyone would expect discussion-wise when this is the case. Sometimes articles are posted to TIA and there is good discussion but those posts are in the minority. If the mods want better discussion then they should allow self-posts but they don't want that. We see self-posts in this sub all the time and there is better discussion so I don't see why we can't have that in TIA. The mods just don't want it. This wasn't always the case there.

 So instead of looting and destroying the property of a group of rich White guys from Oregon they destroyed the property of the Black owners of a local mom and pop store? Sounds about right.

 Yeah but girls don't have the societal and necessary impetus to approach men to get any sort of romantic or sexual gratification started like in a bar or a club. Very few girls like you described exist and behave that way. There are more than a few unattractive guys that behave in an awkward and uncool manner but feel the need to try to engage because both society and women put that burden on nearly all males, both attractive and unattractive alike. It just so happens that the former has to do it a little bit less while the latter has to engage with women 99 percent of the time if they want anything to happen. Most of the time this doesn't end well for them while most of the time it ends well for attractive men. 

It's much easier to get labeled as a creep if you're a man who fucks up socially in romantic situations than it is for a woman to be labeled the same.
