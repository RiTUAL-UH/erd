 "There are two paths before us: Where the corporations dominate or where the public says enough. I ask for your help so that the nation takes the second path,"

a russ feingold quote, not that anyone will see this as i am 10 hrs late. 









 GARY FUCKING ANDERSON!  I remember being a little kid and this game seriously wrenching my soul out.  Then to again have my dreams pushed to the brink of reality a decade later and again, now as an adult, having my body shut down from the disappointment that is, the Minnesota Vikings.  




 Hey everyone.  I currently live and teach in South Korea and the community I live in is kicking off a fund raiser for some schools in Siem Reap, Cambodia.  I first visited Cambodia last summer and walked away awestruck and inspired.  The people of this country have many reasons to be depressed and downtrodden, yet they are not.  A mere 40 years ago Pol Pot's reign of terror and genocide tried to destroy this great country.  So many people are still so affected by this, and yet these people are amazing.  So loving, so friendly, and so much desire to better their country!  Well the fundraiser my community in SK and I are doing is simply a spare change fundraiser in which we handed out Piggy Banks to all interested people, and then told them to bring them back to us on December 16th and also decorate them in an original manner, and we would give prizes away for the best original pigs!  I was wondering if the great people of Reddit would be interested in getting in on this?  Obviously you can't send a Piggy Bank full of change, but people could keep the change in a Piggy Bank, decorate and send pictures?  Or simply just keep some change for a while and donate it.  Figured maybe Reddit wanted to do a little good for some great children and people in an amazing country!  Here are a few websites that talk about the projects I am involved with and also how to help, or how to donate.  Thanks for hearing me out.  If this pig thing is stupid for a real broad internet community, I understand, just was curious if it would work on a wide scale basis.  Cheers!

 Where you are from is a major part of what shapes you as person.  I like America man, and I am proud of that.  I am not necessarily proud of some of the decisions our country has made and especially not proud of our healthcare system in particular.  But I know a lot of great people who would bend over backwards for just about anyone.  These aren't the people that everyone hears about, so it is a shame that the gun-toting obnoxious assholes are all people ever do hear about.  I am proud of the people around me that I saw (don't currently live in America -ironic for me to be defending it and then not living there, I know) who are great people and hardworking and are trying to help our country change for the better. I.E. protests around wall street.  




 Oh I am not proud of the American Government, heck I am not proud of many of my countrymen/women.  But I am still proud to be American as most Australians are proud to be Australian or Brit is proud to be British.  Its my identity and I wouldn't want to change my roots, I want to be proud of them.  




 Defending your country is simply being proud of what you are.  Sure, its great to make fun of what you are and where you are from, that is funny.  But when SOMEONE ELSE pokes fun or insults where you are from, it essentially is them poking fun or insulting you.  I am American, and I make fun of some of our ineptitude, but when another insults it I will stand firm and  try and defend it,  I don't think that makes me "butthurt"  I think that makes me someone who is proud of who I am and where I am from.

 it's flannel mother fucker 




 Getting dongchim'd by a student is one of the most infuriating, awkward, hilarious encounters around.   




 A couple disappointed Daves.... 




 Has anyone tried this powerful treat? 









 Yeah this made me laugh really really hard..."pooped a mudslide" might be one of the funnier things I have read. 




 Oh I totally agree it was very buggy.  But it had such highlights and fun playing time that, to me at least, made up for some really brutal bugs. 




 That was the name of the company.  It was an MS DOS game.   









 Am I the only one that things he looks a whole lot like Frylock from AquaTeen?   Like if cursed by some Master Shake shenanigans?  




 That is real awesome.  I discovered long exposure on the beach as well while watching a fire show in Thailand.  Have an upvote, cheers!

 She is indeed the only one in THIS picture. but her face speaks for them all believe me.  Disgusted by this cookie duster on my lip. 





























 Not sure why you were down voted.  I have many friends that are exactly what you described, people that never leave.  I decided, fuck that, saved up my money and moved out of the country.  Its just all about making the decision to actually do it.

Edit: spelling 




 What is this "athiests" you speak of?   




 The only reason I clicked comments was to upvote this inevitably posted comment. 




 That's so meta... 




  Personally I'd be thinking about the first few weeks after our wedding when we'd start talking about fetishes and sexual boundaries/secret desires and all that and I'd tell her how much I want to give her an enema. To be clear I'd want her to privately give herself an enema first so there's no scat then fill herself up with water again along with 3 movie sized bags of skittles and invite me in the bathroom, I just want her to squat over me in the bathtub so I can stare and poke at her anus as she sprays a jet of skittlewater into my mouth as I wildly jack off as the crack of wet skittles spraying off my teeth creates a machine gun sound effect, then finger her as I lick out her gaping anus as it twitches and quivers. She's a bit weirded out at this but she loves me and knows this fetish is something I've been fantasizing about since I was 12. Plus we're married and have a newborn together, what is she going to do, divorce me over this? She's more than welcome to peg me afterwards or any other fucked up fetish most guys would balk at.

That is my personal favorite.  I still can't stop laughing 




 My best friend has referred to Christmas as Newton Day since we were 14.  I have sent him a "Happy Newton Day!" text now for a decade.   




 losing the game, checking in. 




 My friends and I also saw Jawsome very often, but we have now incorporated more words into this style.  Words like "Jawful" or "Jawstruck"

"Man, I am jawstruck by how jawful this movie is." 




 http://www.unitedwisconsin.com/recall-offices

This is a list of recall offices, and many union halls in cities/towns also have outposts where you can sign them.  That's where my parent's and siblings signed.  As I am living out of country, I can't sign. :(   But promote this list of locations if more people you know are unaware and wish to sign. 




 YUP - Love me some Decemberists, last show I saw before I moved out of the country.  So good. 









 Like I said different strokes for different folks! :) Have an upvote. 




 Definitely love some Tool.  Maynard is a genius.  Puscifer and APC are rad too. 




 Obviously everyone has different tastes in music.  Different strokes for different folks.  So I guess I will start, bands I listen to that really just rock my socks and maybe more people should have their socks rocked by: The Decemberists and Limbeck.

Both awesome, in my opinion.  What about you guys? 




 Agreed, resin taste awful.  It was simply a last resort when the city was dry... 




 Was doubtful, then it lined up with the entire "The King is Dead" album by The Decemberists.  Really cool.  Rad find, man.

 Ed Gien and Jeffrey Dahmer were both from Wisconsin.  ALL WE EVER GET IS CHEESE!   




 I am from Wisconsin, and both of my parents work in cheese factories.  Stereotype proven. 




 My exact strategy last time I played, led to my eventual victory after the 9 hour marathon game.  But sure enough...Australia's owner got second place.
