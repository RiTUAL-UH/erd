 I would think the opposite as soft boiled are generally 'softer', also main concern was the egg white not being strong enough and just breaking when you press.  




 No offense but I'm sure the people who are working on this are a tad bit more knowledgeable than you.  Yeah, obviously there are hurtles, if there weren't any it would be imminent and not 10 years down the road (projected). You people always pop up, "well... established knowledge dictates that this is impossible, therefore any advancement is not possible." Or maybe you're not one of those.  




 So you don't know? 




 Stupid tax. I can understand an old trusting grandma falling for this but like, how do you get suckered into buying something from some random person who pulled up next to you and who wont let you even view the product? I'm a pretty trusting person but errp 




 Do you know if this works with soft boiled? 




 I'll just stick to strutin'. 




 I really don't enjoy riding a bike in Houston. It's fine in neighborhoods and less busy side streets but I just feel extremely vulnerable on a bike with cars (driven by Houstonians) approaching from my blind spot (see: I don't have eyes in the back of my head). I walk anywhere 2 miles or less (walking is under valued in today's society) and taxi anything between 2 and 5 miles, which covers most of my territory.  




 Do those bigger buses have wifi? That's one thing I wish the normal buses had. Netflix just eats at my data cap too quick when I'm not on wifi.  




 I fucking love the light rail. Instead of driving to work, I started commuting via bus and rail. Takes a bit longer (30 mins in morning up from 15-20, 45 in the afternoon up from 30) but god damn are my stress levels way way down. I don't call grandma a cunt for driving too slow or get stressed out when I miss a light. It seriously has improved my life in many ways. I'd recommend it for anyone who can, and hope that with the current surge of centralized population growth, the demand and need will be in place for valuable expansion.

Having a car is nice, not relying on a car is much nicer.  




 I can't forgive you. 




 Was talking about the first player mentioned, Reggie Bush - played for USC. It's the white and red #5 jersey on the left.
 




 I'm worried about how little ass I'll have after seeing him in 5 days.  




 I'll be seeing him at Coachella this weekend! Can't fucking wait. 
 









 People who like college sports? I dunno. 




 Maybe in college, which the jersey is from. 




 No they don't. I get them on average within 10-15 minutes on the weekends. Have never waited an hour. Montrose/Heights/Midtown area. 




 The difference between Mario Williams and Clowney, is that Mario Williams didn't have the best defensive lineman in the league taking pressure off of him in his first season. 




 It's pretty irrelevant man. They're the 16th best team in a 16 team playoff. 




 "Huge playoff push" - yeah, for the 8th seed in the East. They're one and done in the playoffs. That's pretty irrelevant. 




 Well this was an imgur album which didn't have your blog accompanying it. Just going through the pictures in the album, all you get is the burger name and the episode it's from. 




 Funny. The two highest payrolls in the NBA this season are irrelevant teams in the worst of the two confrences. 4th highest payroll has the 6th worst record in the league.

 It was actually a law passed before the rise of childhood obesity in America. And it really has nothing to do with Kinder eggs, it was a law designed to ban the use of non-food stuffs inside of food products, pretty sure less to do with choking hazard and more to do with contamination. 




 So in the last picture with the tacos, it looks like you have uncooked sausage or hamburger in there? What is that?

 How would they get across the Atlantic? Their combined naval force is dwarfed by the US' and their combined air force even more so.

 Your analogy might be good if these companies didn't actually pay fines. But let's make up our own reddit-reality and live there instead.  




 It's unrealistic. Human error alone makes it unrealistic. Add in environmental elements and yeah. You're being unreasonable and frankly pretty ignorant. But enjoy driving to work today. You're definitely not part of the "problem" you see.

 You're unintelligent.

 There are DOZENS of us! 




 In my shoddy attempt at defense, I was drunk last night when I made that comment.

What my mother hears: "Spouting racist rhetoric while inviting murder"

:D 




 My mum was convinced I *would* get raped *just because I moved to NYC*. Not for going out and partying every night, but for living in a city.

While I agree that is valid for a parent to worry about their child's safety, I think it's outlandish to be convinced that you would get raped just because you moved to NYC. That's pretty outlandish, no? Just as a numbers game, the rate of rape per 100,000 people in NYC is 14, while the rate of rape per 100,000 in the US as a whole is almost twice that at 26.9. As far as cities go, NYC is one of the (if not the?) safest, at least in the US. So while it might be *less safe* than where you originate (I'm picturing the town from Hot Fuzz), it's not like you're living in Cairo or Mumbai. If that were the case, I don't think it would be quite so outlandish.

So yeah, we agree, moms worry, it's not wrong for them to worry, I just think the comment I quoted was outlandish.

People worry about a lot of outlandish things, it doesn't mean they're wrong, it just means they worry about unlikely scenarios which they have no control over.
 




 You too pal, you too. 




 If you can't afford a new phone, don't be an irresponsible drunk and lose it.

Good point! Wow, such generalized insight!

That's pretty much the whole point of a bar. Though it is possible to go to one *and not get smashed*, *the odds of that are pretty slim*. 

Smells like you have an alcohol problem.

 I don't think you know what "irresponsible"

I think it's irresponsible for you to assume that someone with a fairly obvious grasp of the English language doesn't know what a basic word like irresponsible means.

 I just don't think you did a very good job of communicating your thoughts to the rest of the class.

But we can go with it being too complex if that's what makes you happy. 




 What are you talking about?  




 No Harden is a plus doe! 




 While I completely agree he's acting unprofessionally, he can't just "go to another team". He's under contract for 3 years - a non cap friendly contract - so it's unlikely he goes anywhere.

My guess is he's getting bad advice from his uncle again. Really really bad advice.

Stop being a baby Andre, you signed a contract, honor it. 




 Oh piss off. There has always been editorial news and 'real' news. Not advocating Fox and Friends but it's not supposed to be a 'real' news show. It's full of human interest pieces and editorialized content.

There are tons of shows - that make up the majority of the air time - that are dedicated to 'real' news.

You can find an example of this type of show in every single country.

 Bad sport. 




 Yeah because seeing the Pacers in the finals would be so much fun! Weeeeee! 




 Come off it man, I was just joking. 




 One of many things that make him so endearing.

I love that he doesn't sound like an actual black person and I can relate to him on a 'normal' level. 




 As a spider, I couldn't agree more.  




 He didn't run a third time because he ran for President of the United States, which he was also elected to twice. 




 He's under contract (not a cap friendly one either) for the next 3 years. Don't expect his situation to change. 




 I have an N64 in it's original box with the original plastic stuff and manuals (pretty sure). box isn't in the best quality but I'd consider parting with it. Also have golden eye 64 with box but the box is in bad condition.

 It addresses the fact that less intelligent individuals tend I reproduce more than intelligent ones.

Is this a fact? I think the corollary to higher amount of offspring is socio-economic, not intelligence. Also, smart people predict we'll hit peak population in 50 years or so.

 Despite all the destruction and deaths it left, Ike's aftermath was pretty fun. Lots of powerless house parties. Everyone had their doors open. You met neighbors you haven't talked to in the 5 years they've lived next door. MREs, etc etc.  




 All I wanted was some mc nugs to nurse my hangover Sunday afternoon, but it was closed because of this. Officially boycotted.  




 Can't be as bad as Coachella the first night. Took 2.5 hours after we got in the car before we were out of the lot. Talk about a clusterfuck. People who took shuttles were waiting until 5 am (last show ends at 1am). 

Although perhaps it will encourage more people to take pub transit or bike or car share.  




 I don't think the connection really fits. One of his big character traits is the whole coming from nothing thus fueling his ambition for power shtick.  




 Mack is going #1 




 Not before the morons screaming "queue the morons screaming 'child abuse, child abuse!'" happens. 




 He does work with inner city youth. He's one of the most intelligent and tactful former professional athletes we have.  




 Hawks crushed the Pacers in their first game too. Just sayin'. Rooting for y'all though.  




 Dude! Mo Williams! 




 Keep the canisters to put junk in and throw away the flimsy boxes. I fill mine with bottle caps. 




 It's actually called a string bet but yeah. 




 That would require coaching. 




 He just seemed like a genuine dude. He played with heart, tenacity and humility. He was by far my favorite player to watch outside of TMac pre-bad back.  




 The stats I saw thrown around were approximately best in the league in PNR and worst in the league in post ups. 




 I agree 100%, I just believe that his post up game has improved under Hakeem and you can see it, if anywhere, in his footwork. He is still a bit clunky at times but he definitely isn't the stone handed offensive liability that /r/nba made him out to be this summer. 




 Which is fair, but I did admit that his time in LA was an unmitigated disaster. 

Dude is busting post moves during the playoffs I didn't even know he had when he was playing for LA.

That's because he didn't have them then. He's been working very closely with Hakeem pretty much since he arrived in Houston and you can definitely see Dream's influence on Howard's post moves. Another sign of his dedication to improvement and his game. 




 "i don't see ~~color~~ flair" 




 I bought signed, game worn Carl Landry shoes a few days before he got traded. Saddest I've ever been as a rockets fan.  




 Chuck wagon! One of my favorite ex-rockets. Dude was a brick house and he had the most entertaining fts.  




 It really sucks when people hate you just because of your flair and your comments are automatically viewed through a filter that no matter how poignant or accurate they are, they're already wrong.  




 There's a huge difference between not supporting someone and actively disparaging him. After Howard signed with Houston, the vast majority of visible Laker fans spewed vitriol and disdain. "He's not big enough for the bright lights and pressure of LA", "he's washed up anyways good riddance", "he doesn't try what a fake superstar", "worse at offense than thabeet". Obviously I don't believe this represents Lakers fans as a whole but the vitriol usually trumps realism in environments like this and that vitriol rose to the top.

I don't blame you for not supporting him. His time in LA was an unmitigated disaster and then he left.

Still, reasonably discussing Howard as a player and a person was next to impossible for a few weeks/months after we acquired him.

/r/nba was sure he was done, was sure his offensive game was on par with Asik, was convinced he was lazy, sure he was a chemistry killer, etc. etc.  




 Yeah how dare I be frustrated that this sub has a persecution complex for the rockets. Seeing nothing but negative post after condemning post gets pretty old pretty fast. 

also logic? What? The average casual fan aka the majority of fans have a positive view of Lin. He's polarizing in places like sports forums because of his erratic play. Vitriol will bleed through logic every time in environments like this.  




 I think there's a difference when you're trying to imply that the Toyota Center went into a collective and orchestrated booing of Lin (which didn't happen), versus a few knuckleheads booing Lin (which could have plausibly happened).

The average casual fan in Houston likes Jeremy Lin, honestly probably more than Harden. Harden gets shit on a lot. I don't understand this perception that he escapes scrutiny while Lin is selectively and constantly dragged under the bus.

But hey, whatever can rile up the most /r/nba-heads to the side of 'not houston'.

 




 A targ bastard repopulating the others? A song of ice and fire. Crastor for AA confirmed.  




 poe's law up in here 




 There is a difference between a collection of knuckleheads booing jeremy lin and the arena booing him. In this case, I'm sure there were a few people in the stands booing Lin directly, however the majority of the boos that people are referring to were directed at a combination of Mo Williams checking in and a bad (not bad) call being replayed on the screen.

I just love how this completely unsubstantiated bullshit has leaked into every fucking thread that is related to the rockets. 




  I still can't understand how the fans accept Harden shooting 30% doing terrible defense all night and for an "All Star" and "1st team all NBA" player.

jesus christ the skewed perception this subreddit has of rockets fans is crazy. harden gets *so much hate* when he plays poorly, way more than lin. acting like rockets fans are happy with harden's performance is absurd. 

i personally think he is playing poorly but i'm not gonna execute the guy for it. he's a person. same with lin; he has played poorly much more than harden has this season yet it never changed my perception of him. he's a person, they're all young. they all have a lot of pressure on them. they don't have the best coach. etc. etc. the point is that win or lose, bad performance or good performance, i support the team and the players.

this subreddit has gotten pretty unbearable for a rockets fan who just fucking enjoys basketball for the simple fact that it's entertaining. i can't even come in here after a loss anymore; and i'm starting to realize that i shouldn't after a win either.

why does everyone have to take the fun out of sports. why can't we just leave it all on the court, accept the outcome, and talk about the game like fans instead of obsessed school girls with emotional problems? 




 it used to be an alright community. there were some solid posters who provided valuable insight. then we got yao ming and with them came what were dubbed YOF (yao only fans - basically 98% chinese people) and that kinda divided the forum and ever since then it's just a huge echo chamber of hate when bad and love when good. i go there during trade season because trade discussion is fun, but anything relating to the actual season and the actual players and the actual games is garbage.

it's kind of like how /r/nba is now. 




 not sure if serious 




 /r/nba is becoming pretty shitty. i do agree that clutch fans is a very shitty place though.

i'm starting to become extremely disillusioned by sports fans in general. they're really starting to fucking bother me. no one can just chill. no one can accept a bad performance. no one can take a step back and look at it all from a wide angle perspective. it's gross honestly.  




  It's like, if Lin makes one bad play, he's shit, yet Harden can make ten bad plays in a quarter and he's just having an off night.

it's ok man, you guys do enough hating on harden already, we're just balancing it out.

also you aren't paying attention too much because people are pretty polar extreme about harden whichever way he is playing.

i was at the first game, it was the 2nd quarter, i went to the bathroom and a guy next to me was talking to his buddy about how shit harden was.

this was the first game and the first half wasn't even over.

you just have a filtered version of reality that support a narrative you want to see. 




  that comes with love and hate.

i disagree. i don't see any reason or benefit to bringing hate into the equation. sure i'll be disappointed if we lose, and i'll be disappointed if harden doesn't play well or howard looks like he's playing lazy or lin does something stupid...but it's just basketball and that disappointment wont last longer than 5 minutes. I love the rockets but i'm never gonna turn that into anything other than joy. if they lose they lose and i go home and i go to sleep and i wake up the next day in the exact same situation as if they'd won.

C'est la vie 




 Rockets bad. Rockets fans bad. James Harden bad. Dwight Howard bad. Jermey Lin 'oh i like him he's only cool rocket'.

/r/nba is a joke. i remember it was like this for the heat a couple seasons ago, which is funny because a couple seasons ago the rockets were /r/nba's favorite second team. 




 I live a couple blocks away from there, gonna be interesting how it changes traffic. I just hope there is a coffee shop in there somewhere, otherwise that Starbucks across the street is gonna start getting stupid busy. 




 this sub is fucking retarded. any reason to hate the rockets and rockets fans. 




 Jesus this subreddit is ridiculous. They've played the exact same amount of games as the Rocket's have. And yeah Rockets fans were the only one's talking shit about Lin when he was playing bad basketball. And we are the only ones riding his dick now that he has played some decent (and tonight great) basketball.

The fucking difference two years makes, from /r/nba's most loveable team to /r/nba's villian number 1.

Bunch of fickle cunts.

 Bad timing. They were booing a replay of a call when he was checking in. Obviously they disagreed with the call.  




 Yah but they didn't make the cut ffs 




 You'd be surprised. Have lived in Houston majority of my 25+ years; lived in Michigan for one of those years. Saying y'all was basically like having a British or Australian accent up there. I was seriously 'exotic'.

 My eyes are open. I choose to enjoy the content that gives me joy, while effectively ignoring those which don't.

Nothing is worse than seeing a post that I enjoyed, wandering into the comments to actively discuss or read a discussion or just make a silly comment, and seeing it filled with nothing but 'repost', 'op is a faggot', 'this isn't oc', 'op is a karma whore', etc. etc.

1st, it takes any potential conversation out of play. 2nd, it's petty. People whine and whine and whine about karma whores and that OP is 'only in it for the karma' and OP 'is trying to deceive us', but they don't realize that half the content they are enjoying could suffer equal fates in their respective comment sections.

It's just bad manners frankly. It's rude. It takes away from other's experiences.

Granted, there are cases where OP has blatantly deceived the reddit populace, but unless it's for actual monetary gain, I honestly could give two shits.

Lied about your mom banging your dog? Cool, thanks for the story.

Lied about a celebrity you saw? Cool, thanks for the photo.

Lied about a place you've been? Cool, thanks for the window to a place I've never been or a reminder of a place I have.

Life's too short to get caught up in the whole 'i'm being (potentially) deceived by someone who has nothing to gain so I should let it get to me' game. 




 I thought reddit was for us to ingest content, not to whine when the free entertainment we are given isn't up to our absurdly high standards. Traditionally speaking of course. 
 




 First, he never claimed them as his own in the title. Second, if this is the kind of thing that grinds your gears you should seriously reflect on the things that make you tick. 

 




 Sports fans are not rational creatures. 




 Barring a miracle run to the finals, I think he's gone no matter what happens the rest of the way. 




 Ps your team doesn't exist.  




 James Harden's sorry ass. 

Gotta love this subreddit.  




 Portland also had to have a record setting game by LMA to get to OT and they had a few circus shots and a tip that could have gone either way in the first game. So you're not saying anything. Just typical basketball fan who can't digest more than the most recent game at a time.

I get that she's in a shitty situation post GOT but that doesn't mean people have to like her.

Arya, on the other hand, is cunning, brave, strong, independent, adventurous, awesome, resilient, funny, and relatable to 'the little guy'. 




 I believe diedrichs was bought buy Starbucks or went bankrupt and the manager bought that location and changed it to Dirks.

 I was wondering if that's what the sign meant by 'thank you montrose'. Used to go there but Starbucks is closer and the baristas are much friendlier + green tea. Though their iced coffee was divine. Sad to see it go.
