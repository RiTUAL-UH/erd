 Really? That's pretty awesome, is the story punchy and short? Thats what I like to see in an indie game, its certain;y the kind of game I want to make. 









 Enslaved? 




 You've reminded me I need to finish Skyward Sword 




 He had almost a Peanuts-style humour about him, strangely mature and insightful for such a youngling. 




 I completely forgot this character existed, seems like Tecmo Koei really love Twilight Princess. 




 already have, it's well made 




 Yes, but difficulty is usually a detriment to my experience. Let me explain. 

I like the idea of high difficulty, but it is rarely used with any great effect and instead of adding to the tone of a game, any sense of tension is deflated by the fact that while you may be vulnerable, your enemies are bullet/hit sponge demi gods.

I like the idea of getting hit once and dying, but I need my enemies to have the same vulnerability, otherwise it's an exercise in grinding and not tension. 

So instead, I often play on easy so enemies go down fast but reset to checkpoint if I get hit by a bullet, like a mentally enforced, pretend high tension difficulty mode.

It's annoying, because how hard is it to put in a difficulty mode where almost everything, including you, dies in one hit? 




 
He slaughters those guys in the bar and then uses that conspirator against King Foltest as bait for the striga.
In the games Geralt seems like he has more of a warm heart, does his character change in the books, or have the games made Geralt more sympathetic?
Don't get me wrong, the book is so far really awesome (got the audiobook), it's just interesting to compare and contrast.

 Morrowind is pretty great for that candy shop feeling. 




 I think it's fair for the devs to want to be secretive too though, it's more special if you don't understand the systems of a game when you first play it. 




 I hope this game isn't being overhyped by people on message boards. It definitely looks like a cool game, but I feel people need to temper expectations, so if it is mindblowing, it will be a nice surprise. 




 Very cool idea! Hope the world is super reactive. 




 So in this game, what are the limitations on freedom? I have never played Elite, but can you land on planets or other ships? Can you get out of your ship? Are any space sims like that?

Or is it mostly UI and flight? 




 I love listening to todd howard talk about game making. Dunno what it is. 




 https://www.youtube.com/user/PrescriptionPixel is a really cool indie game channel, I would love to know about more like this.

and

https://www.youtube.com/user/SonsOfVidya/ is two down to earth guys whose banter I find really funny and not forced. 




 I'm curious about relatively new/small gaming channels that people on /r/games think are really good or interesting.

I enjoy TB and Dodger but sometimes it's cool to see some less prominent talent on YouTube.

I'll post a couple I found down below, in the effort of fairness. Hope to see some good suggestions.

 This definitely looks interesting, I wonder if there will be a mod to change the camera in this game? I don't have anything against people enjoying isometric, but I like to see things up close generally. 




 This sounds excellent, hope to see more 60fps trailers and gameplay demos.  
























 oh cool! 




 it still fits, the squash banana is simba 




 The only thing I would want extra from this game is the ability to make my own character. Making a woman would be cool, for instance, but hey it looks rad anyway so yeh good luck to em. Can't wait to buy it :) 



















 Nice video! Will it be a 60 dollar purchase or subscription? 




 I've never looked into this game much, but can someone tell me if this is correct?

It will be a game where you buy and upgrade your space ship, you can leave your pilots seat at any time and board other ships or walk around space stations. You can use a gun and you can also land on planets (cutscene landing?)

If thats right that sounds really good, but will there be a story or is it more of an MMO experience type deal? 









 I've been to the U.S. and it really is full of lovely people. I think the american political system is horseshit and your social structure is unfair, but god damn, everyone I met over there was so friendly and kind. 









 I love PBS game show :) 









 Bethesda Harry Potter game would be amazing. Going to classes, learning spells, finding hogwarts secrets, having friends (companions) and all of that would be amazing. 




 I really hope they do voice acting in French with english subtitles, love French language :D 




 Looks really awesome, makes me want to go back to working on a proof of concept I did ages ago about a wild animal game:

 Corgi's are amazing! 









 Fear. 




 Writing is still important but its now become a first step for other mediums. Video content comes to mind (youtube videos like "explainers". Good speaking and imagery is important but the writing underneath is why people keep coming back. Edit: sorry, on mobile 




 sounds perfect, do you have a greenlight page? will probably get it

P.s. how did you get into games writing? I'm making my own games currently so I can get some experience writing stories for games. Did you do the same?
 




 Definitely would love to see a Bioshock game that tackles military interventionism, particularly given recent controversies surrounding drone strikes. It can really paint you into a corner when you start creating enemies as a consequence of trying to stop your enemies. If that can be intelligently critiqued I would be pretty stoked.

Along similar lines, I feel systems like the military industrial complex or the surveilance state would also be interesting issues. Metal Gear Solid has already addressed this pretty well already, though albeit in a completely different fashion to what Bioshock could do.
