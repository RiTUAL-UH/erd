 I drew a few drawings, and that's about it! 




 I am doing fine and I am very sleepy as it's almost 1am here :) What about you? 




 Hello! 




 Our Lord is testing your faith. Don't join the ugly shills at Cyanocorp. 




 5.5.0


Damn, you are futuristic. 




 Nope, no idea about it as I have never been there :( 









 Yes, it's similar in India! It's unbearably hot here, too. 




 It's 12am here and I turned 16 just now! Feels awesome :) 




 Naut 3 is a really good theme and it would make the sub look elegant. 









 I had been working on it since 4 hours and I made this app which doesn't do much! Feels great :) 














 Comcast= Literally Hitler


Hitler=  Approved Prophet


Therefore, Comcast is an Approved Company. 














 Just curious as many people don't seem to know about it. 









 Please be serious here. Did 5.1 manage to fix your 5.0 complaints? Because I am getting quite stellar performance on 5.1... 














 Praise DuARTe! 









 Stop this sub from being infected with Galaxy S6 shills!


**DO IT FOR DUARTE!** 









 It's 1st April! 




 Ban Ki-Earth. 









 And why is he Lord DuARTe?

* I sacrificed three goats to Lord DuARTe for this post.

 **Best Phone :** Nexus 6

**Disclaimer to moderators:**
Slight OT is fine, but when users decide to act stupid they should be dealt with with the appropriate means - its really annoying for me when OT turns crazy. Please put the warning/ban hammer anytime any of you think there's lack of respect and/or too much unwanted OT crap - but if it doesn't meet this criteria let the OT posts alone. Thank you.

Cheers! 




 Is it a massive battery drain or a light one? 
























 Just curious as I just got my  N7 2013 and I wanted to flash a kernel. Also, as this is essentially a Snapdragon 600, is it safe to overclock it to 1.7 GHz? 






















































 ... For not updating the Steam app to material design. 









 Go to developer options and tick "Disable HW overlays". I haven't experienced any redraws after that. 
























 Google's developers took a couple of weeks off for the holidays  or from my perspective, they gave me a couple of weeks to rest  but now they're back and it's time for the app updates to resume. Naturally, it's time to breathe life back into the teardowns, and we're back with a  VERY big one. Google Search v50.2 began rolling out to users yesterday, and we've already seen quite a few HUGE adjustments and improvements. After plenty of digging, a stack of additional changes have surfaced, including one that is already live, and several more just waiting for some finishing touches including the much awaited **Project Food**. 
             **Disclaimer**: Teardowns are, by their nature, speculative and based on incomplete evidence. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. There is always a chance that details may change or plans may be cancelled prior to launch of a new feature. As with all rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced.
        
* **'Ok Google Make me a Sandwich'**
By far, this is the biggest feature Google has implemented. This is the first step to Google's ambitious 'Project Food'.  Just say the phrase "OK Google, Make me a sandwich" and lo, your sandwich will be made by your mobile! This will, according to Google, go a long way in providing free food to everyone.

* **Excitement for the future**
There are subtle hints dropped for us to see that Project Food is about to come. For example, when we saw the code, there was a line which mentioned, "OK Google, make me a burger." This probably means that Project Food will cover a variety of foods, ranging from burgers to sandwiches. 
Here is the code we observed
     string name="search_pref_header""OK Google, Make me a burger"/string
     string name="search_bluetooth_pref_title"Make a burger/string
     string name="search_headset_pref_title"BURGER BURGER!/string
     string name="search_headsets_confirmation_title"BURGER PROCESSING!/string
     string name="search_headsets_confirmation_body"YOUR BURGER IS READY TO EAT!!!!!/string


*  **Wrap-Up**
* That's about it for this teardown. It's clear Google is preparing quite a few changes for the coming months, and there's definitely something for everybody on this list. It's only January, and there's already a lot showing up in the Search app, so by the time I/O rolls around, most of this list will probably be live and we'll have a whole new set of foods to eat. I think it's going to be a good year for food junkies.

 This problem is resolved if I use a headphone. But why is this happening? 




 This didn't happen before... 














 Personally, I prefer Philz because of its interface. 




 Boxing gloves to punch the shills. 














 What can I do? Please help. 














 Do you face the same annoying launcher redraws on the GPE ROM? 




 Seeing that it did not bring any significant performance improvement, is the ART runtime insignificant? 



















 The old AOSP Messaging, or the new Google Messenger? 





























 Same with me, I have never even taken a selfie, let alone posting it :( 




 Think you forgot Ingress? 




 You guys don't understand, Lord DuARTe uses a Macbook to keep an eye on the enemy. 




 India... 




 Blazing hot. 40C/104F. 




 Thanks for the advice, I would definitely try that today! 




 But how do I go about drawing them... When I draw real-life people, they turn out to be a complete disaster :( 




 But my drawings will look very amateurish to you!...


[Here's one!](http://i.imgur.com/ZBMROO6.jpg) 




 Great! I never can do as good as that! 




 Yes!!! 




 Even I am glad that I took it up. Really helps me utilise my free time. Can you show me one of your drawings? :D 




 I did realize the fact, that's why I inserted it there :P


I quit drawing a few years back, but this year I started to love it again, and I started spending more of my time on it... 




 I live in Maharashtra... 




 I love drawing catoons! (and sneks, lol jk). What do you like to draw? :) 




 **MY EYES ARE RELIEVED!!** 




 I am in India, and I just finished the 10th grade exams... 




 I love drawing, and tinkering with my mobile... 




 What about you? 




 Ummm... You would find me a wierd personality, as I never listen to music and I don't play games... 




 I am just watching a few vids... 




 XD. So, what are you doing? 




 [Saw ths pic, can't stop laughing!](http://i.imgur.com/tW4AjAU.jpg) 




 Indian food :) ... What about you? 




 Sure :D 




 But the effects were great... 




 Bored, too... nothing much to do :( 




 Yeah, certainly nice to look at!  




 The James Cameron one! 




 Yes, I seem to prefer dogs! 




 You saw Avatar? 









 Then.... Gravity? 




 You saw Interstellar? 




 [For all orange fans!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN5PoW7_kdA)     




 It's about cats? Somehow, I don't seem to like cats... 




 Yes! 




 I've never read horror books, too. 




 Which ones do you like? 




 I have no work to do currently :( Just browsing reddit... 




 I never watch horror movies. Do you read books? 




 No. *Hint: The country which your team defeated in the Cricket World Cup semifinals* 




 Thanks! What do you plan to do now? 




 If you like animated movies, you would love to watch Home! It's a cute movie :D 




 Yep. 




 Nothing, just browsing CC, nothing to do :( What about you? 




 Hi, just feeling very bored! 




 Far off... 




 Nah... 




 I doubt... 




 Now guess where I live... 




 :P 




 I made it orange. 




 Australia? 




 Asia? 




 In your house? 




 [Here are my new shoes!](http://imgur.com/39L28Yw)   




 Water :P 




 I would, for sure. 3 of my friends have come over, will you be there in 2 hours? Will catch up with you! 




 I bought a Sketchers running shoes for my birthday! 




 I woke up and read the newspaper. That's about it :P In the evening, I would go for running, as I am excited about my new shoes :) 




 Hi! So, how's your day going? 




 Hey, no problem mate. :D 




 Thanks a lot! 




 Power cut at my place, and I switched to my mobile. Really can't do much at 1.20 AM without lights :'( 




 Visita


Reminds me of their epic failure. 




 Power cut here :( On my mobile now, really can't do much without lights at 1.15 AM :'( 




 Really sorry, my scanner is not working :'( Please forgive.

 I am starting to love drawing now! 




 Thanks! 




 What was the epicentre? Any idea? 




 Shit! All safe? 




 I didn't get you! 




 Right! 




 Not Sunday yet, though! But Saturday's almost over :)

 Same for you, mate.  




 Even I am hoping for the same...

 




 He was 14 when a bullet hit him during school rifle practice. He's still in coma now after 2 years... 




 I read that one of your friends suicided. Even one if my school friend was hit by a bullet, and I know how it feels :( 




 I haven't slept before 3 since the start of April! 




 Hey! What's up? 




 Hey, what's going on? 




 Happy birthday! 




 The British spellings are always used in my country, so I prefer them. 




 Mornings! That's what I've done always! 




 :D 




 Yes! Sure! I would love to :D 




 :( Thanks for the info, though! 




 I have seen you before on this sub posting about it... 




 My Nexus is currently at home, so I cannot provide proof. Till then, I am using a Moto G GPe. What about you, OnePlus shill?

Ceiling. 




 Umm... I don't know... Never seen any cases or so... 




 Hmmm... Interesting. I read that it stops on a fact-book, but I guess it would be wrong. 




 The reason behind saying bless you is, when we sneeze, our heart-beat stops for a millisecond. 




 Hi, Philippines! 




 I know, the whole country is in ruins :( The tremors were felt here in India, too. 




 Seeing your username, are you fine? 




 Nope. I have never had one before :) 




 I don't think so :P
