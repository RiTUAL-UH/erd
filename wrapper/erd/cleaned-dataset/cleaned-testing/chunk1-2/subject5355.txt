 Unless I'm mistaken there is no way to reverse balding and methods to slow it down are pretty ineffective. Why is this? What challenges are impeding a cure for baldness? 














 I'm interested in a bit of an overview of all major changes in hunting patterns, so feel free to take 'early humans' to mean any period you're most interested in answering for.

Anyway, I'm just curious as to how early humans actually approached a hunt. When did traps become popular? Did humans usually approach hunting in small or large groups? Silently, or did we tend to just bumrush animals with spears and arrows? Was it typical for a human to be able to just spear an animal for a kill with little effort, or would most hunts involve chasing an animal until it was tired, throwing out spears/arrows until it was too exhausted to avoid them. 









 Having played both LoL and Dota, I'm amazed at how badly LoL players overstate the problems associated with voice chat. These team oriented games benefit greatly from ease of communication, I find it weird to not include it. Does HotS have voice chat? 




 Have Valve ever made an official statement on Dota 2 achievements? 




 After reading a TIL today, I just realised how little I know about the Vietnam War. Like, embarrassingly little. Can anyone recommend a good book on the subject as a whole? 




 Anyone from [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_heads_of_state_and_government) is valid, however, for the sake of simplifying things, feel free to just use the leaders you're familiar with and see if someone one ups you.

* Round 1: an all out fight in a large, empty arena. No hiding or leaving the arena until everyone has tapped out, been knocked unconscious or been killed.

* Round 2: A large woodland, 5km by 5km. Everyone starts at a random location with no knowledge of the area. Tools are their standard attire (eg. Obama in a suit etc), a hunting rifle with 12 shots, a handgun with a single bullet, a machete and two litres of water. They must hunt each other and survive the elements until only one is standing. Weather conditions are cold, prone to rain. Water and animal life is scarce. There are some bears, but most animal are not aggressive. This is mostly a test of survival skills and hunting ability - both the ability to remain undetected and to detect others.

* Round 3: Each leader gets the powers commonly attributed to them in popular culture and propaganda. 




 ELI5: What are the major differences between a Prime Minister and a President? Specifically, US and Australia? 




 And does the same apply to all solar systems? Or was much of the matter created during the early development of the universe? 









 Is there any way to sort my workshop subscriptions by game? 




 I've played the game before, but never finished. I'm intending to just go for the main quest this time around and want to do it with mods (which I haven't done before). So, hit me with 5 I should use. 









 Seems like it's great for developers, but what does it actually mean for me as a consumer? 




 Is it possible? Anyone have the IP? 




 It would play more or less exactly the same as Dota, but the characters would be personnel of Russia's Ministry of Finance. You could play as many personalities such as Anton Siluanov, Roman Artyukhin, various secretaries and accountants, and even State Secretary-Deputy Minister of Finance Sergei Shatalov.

I might even include some of the greats from the past such as Yegor Gaidar and Mikhail Zadornov.

If it's a success, I'm also thinking of creating spin-offs such as France's Ministry of Agriculture. Who would pass on a chance to play as Agriculture Minister Dominique Bussereau? Not many I would think. 




 I'm currently 23, almost 24, and about to finish my Bachelor of Accounting. I feel like my resume is very underwhelming so I want to gain some work experience before beginning my job search. I'm thinking of calling some places up tomorrow, but I feel pretty weird about it. Most of my peers seem to already be 'out' in the world and I've only ever worked casual jobs. When I think of work experience I think of 18 year olds tops. Am I too old to old or is my anxiety unfounded?

Australian if that's at all relevant. 




 Like, OK, you might leave an chip packet and mountain dew can on your desk when you're in the middle of a session. Maybe you occasionally go back for a second without cleaning up the first and it looks a little messy. But eventually you decide to throw it out... or most people would. How can these people let such small messes become such big messes. It takes zero effort to throw your rubbish in the bin whenever you next get up, but they voluntarily leave it there?

I can't get into the minds of these people, what's the cause of this condition? I can understand massive weight gain because at least it takes effort to lose weight and eat right, but I just can't understand letting something so simple to manage spiral so far out of control. 




 Just out of curiosity? When I was job hunting I'd often try and apply for jobs same day, which lead me to getting stressed quite a bit if I found a lot I liked in the same day. However, I ironically landed the one job I procrastinated for applying for, which had been open for two weeks. It got me wondering if maybe I didn't need to be so worried with applying ASAP. So, for future reference, how long are jobs typically open for?

I'm Australian if that affects anything. 









 As in, do you (or have you ever) made it a matter of course to browse through people's pictures, videos, website accounts, etc. when repairing a computer? What's the most interesting thing you've found? Do most people have weird ass porn fetishes? 









 In the movie Schindler's list, there's a wonderful scene where Schindler is sobbing because he couldn't save more Jews. Is this scene based on reality at all? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0T1od5dUoA 




 Some of the key characteristics of the Borg is their very stiff movement and a disregard for their environment save for their immediate objectives. While this works well for them when you treat the drones as simple fodder to achieve low key objectives, with most of their strength coming from their advance technology and space warfare, they would still be highly inefficient in ground combat.

I'm not saying they'd be bad, they can hand a large amount of firepower, are probably quite accurate with phasers and have exceptional strength - you wouldn't want a bunch of Borg advancing on your position. But they're still less efficient then they could be - they don't seem to exhibit a lot of fine motor movement which would be handy for navigating a battlefield (trenches, caves, barricades, etc) nor do they run, meaning it would be easy to retreat from them, they could get picked off easily, etc.

**So my question is this:** do the Borg simply not possess the technology to make highly efficient, 'athletic' Borg soldiers? Or is it simply due to the fact that it is not required of them to achieve their goals that making Borg this complex would use more resources than they would gain? 




 Just a quick one, but which of these three entities would win if they started setting their sights on each other? 




 So I've rewatched the original movie a couple of times since the reboot has been out, and I noticed a few things over the course of the film that I believe support this hypothesis.

First, before I go into this, you have to keep in mind that Taylor and his crew traveled FORWARD through time for many thousands of years, giving enough time for all the necessary changes to take place. Now, onto the evidence.

Firstly, when Taylor arrives of the Ape planet, he discovers that it is perfectly hospitable. The right makeup in the air, the right distance from the sun, drinkable water, etc. The odds of this happening are actually incredibly slim. Even an amateur astronomer can tell you that. It's not definitive proof, since there could be some fluke that makes an equally habitable planet with the same landscapes and sky as Earth, but it's highly unlikely and is a big hint that this planet may be Earth right off the bat.

Secondly, evolution is a very complex thing, and it is not conceivable to think that by sheer luck, a second planet would evolve humans, apes and horses on it AND that Taylor would happen to land on that planet. This is absurd. The apes and Taylor also share a common language - English. Whatever happened on Earth during these few thousand years to eliminate the humans and cause the apes to become smart was not enough to eliminate written and spoken language. The apes adopted this language as their own, allowing Taylor to communicate with them. Also many of the apes names are also human names, clearly adopted in addition to the English language.

Third; at the end of the movie, Dr. Zaius hints at some sort of catastrophe. Something clearly happened on this planet and could explain its current state - like a war that reduced the humans to small tribes allowing the apes to take over.

Finally, the very last scene shows Taylor confronting the statue of Liberty, an Earth structure. His inititial assumption is that the statue of liberty was blown up and the debris traveled through space. I suggest that the statue has been in this position all along, just decayed with time... **EARTH** 




 Alright, first things first, I'm not sure if this is appropriate for this subreddit, so if not let me know and I'll delete the post. If anyone knows of a better place, please share. So onto the question...

I've been watching a lot of older sci-fi and it all seems very twist heavy, and it got me thinking, how surprising where the twists when they first appeared in cinema? On one side of the coin - even if you hadn't seen or heard of the twists before, you can still 'see them coming', they all seem kind of obvious. However, today's audiences are probably more trained to that sort of thinking, right? Would older twists have been more likely to take people by surprise, even if they'd seem obvious to movie goers today? Twists still predated movies and television too, so it's not like it was a new concept.

Some specific examples I'm interested in - were most people surprised by the twists in:

* Planet of the Apes
* In general, The Twilight Zone
* Hitchcock's Psycho
* Soylent Green
* Invasion of the Body Snatchers (haven't seen original, but I'm referencing the end of the 1978 version where it leads you to believe he is human trying to fit in, but is actually 'snatched')
* That one dude being a robot in Alien (forgot his name)

 I have a lot of questions I'm interested in asking someone who knows a lot about cinema, like "how was this twist perceived at the time" or "what was making a movie like in 1935". Basically, not just trivia, but questions about movies in a historical context, from a cinema historian or whatever they'd be called. What's the best subreddit to ask these sorts of questions?

Basically, the r/askhistorians of movies. 









 Just bumped into a player who is abusing 1v1 mode in order to farm compendium points. He is picking Nature's Prophet, deliberately feeding to end the game prematurely and requeuing. Is there anyone I should report him too and is this a known thing? 









 The real life counterparts of Donkey Kong and the bosses from his last two games battle it out in a series of 1v1s. These are rough approximations of the animals real life counterparts and some liberties had to be taken (especially with the more fictional bosses from the first game).

**Donkey Kong**

Stronger side of the typical Gorilla. Approximately 200kg, 1.9m tall.

**Opponents:**

* Ba-Boom, a Chacma Baboon, the largest of the baboon species. Around 45kg, about 1.1m tall.

* Bashmaster, a large polar bear, around 650kg size male.

* Pompy, a full grown sea lion, around 300-350kg, about 2.5m long

* Lord Fredrik, a male pacific walrus around 2,00kg

* Mugly, fictional, so let's just say he sort of triceretops like in stature I suppose

* Thugly, we'll say a White Rhinoceros, about 3,500kg and 3.5 long

* Colonel Pluck and his Stompybot 3000. No real world equivalent, so instead it's a man driving a Smart Car (can attempt to run the Gorilla down)

* The ragtag bunch, all the leftovers team up against the gorilla: a mole, a gray owl, a yellow blowfish, a dodo and 3 Japanese Spider Crabs.

**Round 1**

Each boss fights our gorilla. Who wins? Does Donkey Kong sweep the competition in real life, or does he find himself greatly outclasses? Each battle takes place on a plain, open field in daylight. The animals are displaying their fullest aggression.

**Round 2**

Of all the animals that beat the gorilla, who of those would be victorious if they all fought eachother? 




 So it's been a pretty big secret to who this Batman character really was with many characters discussing the possibilities throughout the movies. But I think I have gathered enough evidence to show that Lucious Fox was indeed Batman the whole time.

1. Lucious had access to all the technology that Batman had used throughout the series as the head of Wayne Enterprises military contracts division. This can be clearly seen from all the scenes in which he is showing off the technology to the Bruce Wayne character.
2. The movie spends a disproportionately large amount of time focusing on Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent for some reason. Why? So it seems more natural to have Lucious Fox on screen.
3. Lucious Fox CLEARLY hints at being Batman in the scene where he is confronted by that accountant dude or whatever.
4. Batman dresses in all black. Lucious Fox is black
5. Why the Bat theme? Bruce Wayne has a fear of bats. Lucious spends a large time around Wayne. Wayne most likely relayed his fear of bats to Lucious
6. There is no other likely contender from the movies main characters (Dent would be too busy during the day to go around at night crime fighting, Alfred is too old, Gordan and Batman are seen on screen at the same time, Bruce Wayne is too busy working out, taking tours of the military contract division, hiding from the public eye and playing with bat themed military gadgets to go around crime fighting)
7. I zoned out of the movies a lot to be honest, which means that there was probably LOTS of evidence I overlooked suggestions Lucious is Batman, which is EVIDENCE IN ITSELF. 




 Preferably spoiler free? Unfortunately I live in the middle of nowhere and my Internet sucks to much to stream. 




 [So I posted this the other day](http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/29886w/do_i_need_to_apply_new_thermal_paste/) to PCmasterrace. Seemed like I needed to replace my thermal paste, so I did yesterday, but it hasn't seemed to have helped my temperature issues. I'm still hitting the same temperatures. After the paste didn't work the first time, I took it off to check it looked right (it did) and reapplied a second time. So I'm guessing it's not the paste (unless there's a break in period, but I haven't noticed even a slight temperature drop. Paste was Deep Cool Z9).

Is there anything else that might be wrong that I should check? I have a Corsair H50 and it feels like water is still being pumped when I put my finger on the tubes.

What should I check next? 




 Firstly, I'm not amazingly good with computers. I've installed a new graphics card in the past but that's about it.

Anyway, currently, my CPU's temperature is sitting at about 70-75 degrees celcius when idle and 80+ when gaming. I haven't had any performance issues until today, so I don't know how long its been hitting this temperature for, but it's seems to be causing some issues today.

I cleaned off the fans and checked how fast they were spinning with speedfan (CPU fan 4450 rpm, system fan 1580 rpm). I did a quick google and these speeds seem to be normal. So that leaves me with two possibilities.

The first is that water cooling system. I didn't build this PC, but the person who did told me I shouldn't need to do anything with this maintenance wise since its a closed system. Is this true?

If so, that leaves the heatsink. It's (obviously) very hot to the touch. I'm a little worried about taking it off since I'm worried I'll fuck up my PC, but is this the likely issue? How can I check for certain before I try reapplying paste? And anything I should know before doing so?

Thanks.

(perhaps there is a better subreddit to ask this?) 














 Just for some fun, what ideas would you like to see for future Steam events? Considering most people are unhappy with the direction Steam's sale events have taken (cash grab instead of achievement hunts) what would you like to see instead?

My idea is probably a little too much effort for how little Valve would get out of it, but it would be cool to see a series of 'Camp Contests' utilising the current team system instead of buying items in the top Valve games.

For example, a Dota 2 could have a special queue open that matches you with people on your Steam team. The winning team contributes 50 points, each tower 10 points and each kill 1 point to your team's summer sale score.

Could do similar with TF2 and CS:GO as well as . In addition to random players on the winning team each day getting their games, top 5 MVP's from each game (any team) could get their wishlist games or something.

Of course, I doubt this would ever happen since it's harder to monetize, but I think it'd be a much more exciting community event instead of this money spending competition. 














 With only 15 crafted, I wanted to get an idea of their current value. I had a look on Dota2lounge and the steam market and can't find the level 5 treasure or the helmet in either place. It's gotten me curious: do you think some of those 15 that have been crafted so far may never see the light of day? Although Dota 2 has a huge fanbase, there are still people who haven't played it or stopped playing it and may not realise the value of the item they have. 




 Most people probably already know which hero they want to play when they queue. You don't need to consider allies picks. Can we have a shorter (10-30 second) character select timer and a 30 second pre-start period? Or something along those lines? 




 It seems a little lacklustre without it. 









 I never played it online and I really hope SSB WiiU has some proper matchmaking system instead of just queuing you with completely random individuals - that'd just lead to a series of one sided matches.

Even something simple like Mario Kart's system. So did Brawl have a matchmaking/ranking system and if so, was it any good at pairing you with like-skilled individuals? 




 Is there any reason Sniper got no lines in Love   War? 




 So I'm not particularly good at Chess, so maybe I'm overlooking something obvious. But, I sometimes like to set up random positions against the Chess.com computer and play against it at max strength and get utterly trounced by it. But today it made a weird move.

I'll start from a few moves in - personally I find context helps, but better players can probably just skip to the next paragraph if you'd rather just jump straight to the point. Basically, starting from [THIS](http://imgur.com/cVLxxma) position (me white, computer black) I took the computer's Queen with the a pawn. It took my castle with the black square bishop and captured that bishop with my knight. Then the computer moved the king to D7 and I captured the second Bishop. It moved the King to C6 leaving us [HERE](http://imgur.com/51se0oN).

Then I realised my Knight was trapped and just moved to capture the black pawn with my knight. [May as well take a pawn if I'm moving my knight](http://imgur.com/doWtvLG). I expected the computer to just recapture with the King, but instead it did moved the rook on a8 to a1. I captured the rook with my remaining rook for a free piece and [THEN it took the knight with the king.](http://imgur.com/tZ4YTIn)

So, basically, why did the computer (set at the strongest difficulty) throw away the rook like that? I'm sure it's something obvious that will make me facepalm. 




 Just an idea (probably not an original one), but how would you guys feel about seeing complementary item sets for Io and his partners?

For example, CK and Io could each have a "Global Chaos" set for whatever. Io cosmetics are hard, but maybe custom tether animation, Wisp balls that look 'Chaos Knightish' and makes his colour a more darkish red. Maybe CK's set adds some Io elements somehow.

Anyway, when both have their sets equipped, they'd get a more powerful looking tether animation, different relocate symbol and relocate timer and other assorted effects unique to that set.

Could do this with all Io partners. 



















 I'm interested in seeing the group stages, but moreso I want to plan some free time around the games I want to watch live. Does Valve usually release the group stage schedule in advance or will I have to wait til the day? 




 and if so, does it accommodate for it in anyway? For example, would Bobby Fischer's 1972 rating of 2785 be considered 'better' than a 2785 of today, or could it be fairly said that a rating of 2850-2900 be a more significant accomplishment then Fischer's rating? 




 And if so, free or paid? Will there be a 'season pass' type deal? 




 After reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/27hb10/a_game_named_steam_the_game_appeared_on_store_for/), what would you like to see in a Steam 'meta' game?

An actual simulation of using Steam similar to the [Newgrounds sim](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/236362)?

A unique TCG featuring Valve characters and other popular Steam game card sets?

Maybe a mini-game HUB (Chess, Poker, Checkers, and other traditional board and card games complete with ladders and rankings)?

These last two could follow Valve's traditional F2P model and would help tighten the Steam community.

Or is this too much of a cash n' grab? What other ideas could be cool? 









 Or do I have to use that ugly hat? 




 Can be TV, movie, album outtake, etc. 




 That AREN'T developed by Valve. 














 I remember a match with where Na'vi randomed Zeus (I believe). Does anyone have the link to that and other pro games where there have been random heroes. Has there ever been an entire 5 hero random?

 Is global population likely to have a major effect on the standard of living anytime soon? Is there a tipping point where we won't be able to 'turn back'? Are we simply judging overpopulation by our current infrastructure, but could very easily deal with a much large population by simply building more?

Something I worry that my future grandchildren might have to face, but am admittedly very ignorant on. But seeing that the world population went from 3 billion to 7 billion in just 50 years is both amazing and scary. 









 I'd love to see a minor content update - anything - to justify Valve slapping that game back on the front page again. It was really fun, but the community is basically non existent at the moment. The game is just sitting there, perfectly playable, free to play, with no one touching it. 









 And how did his superiors feel about him burning 11(?) of their navy's ships? Frankly I'd be a little pissed. Were they expensive or important ships? 









 Long story short, trying to upgrade through the store has been a hassle. Several seconds into the install, the Store app just crashes. I can go back to my desktop, but trying to open store again (by moving my mouse to the top left of the screen) just causes the Store to boot from scratch. I literally can't get more than a few seconds into the download.
Is there another way to go about this? Like a torrent or disc I can order from Microsoft?

 Twitch just loads so slowly for me, it's unwatchable and buffering is unreliable in my experience. 




 What exactly does Blizzard do during maintenance each week? I'm surprised a company as large and experience as Blizzard needs to effectively cut people off from their games once a week. For me, someone who can only play between certain times, I literally can't play at all on Tuesdays.

Edit: No idea why I'm getting downvoted, I'm genuinely curious as to what the maintenance process is, why it needs to be so regular and why they need to take all games and servers offline at the same time to perform it. I'm not in IT.

 Only Sherlock knows of the crime as Moriarty explicitly told him he was planning it, but otherwise knows no details. Instead of solving the crime himself (someone has to make all this delicious honey), he sends notice to the world's best detectives to step in and thwart Moriarty instead. Unfortunately, they too are also busy, and decide to send their sidekicks in their places.

Which sidekick has the best chance of solving the crime?

* John Watson (original Doyle Sherlock canon)
* Natalie Teeger (Monk)
* Robin (Adam West Batman)
* Gus (Psych)
* Luke Triton (Professor Layton)
* Richard MacDuff (Dirk Gently)
* Penny (Inspector Gadget)
* Shaggy (without the rest of the gang)
* Tin Tin's dog

 How much additional data is there to download after installing data from the PC version of FFXIV: ARR? 




 One of the biggest criticisms of WoW is its grind. I have to admit, at the moment, I'm not having too much fun. It seems that everyone I know absolutely adores WoW, but right now, I'm not digging it. Can someone please tell me what I can expect from the game in the long run and where it 'picks up'?

Secondly, right now, I'm currently leveling my first new character. I'm playing the game as the game downloads (it's not even at optimal yet) and I'm experiencing about 200-600 ping. I'm wondering: What is the ping typically like for Australian players? I'm hoping this ping is just due to the client downloading data as I play.

 I really like the idea of MMORPGs, but the few I've played have failed to truly engage me. Could someone recommend me something - preferably an upcoming title - that might actually satisfy me. 

The ones I put the most time into were:

* Star Trek Online: Loved the space battles and just the general feel of traveling through space. But everything else sucked. Combat felt skill-less, lack of variety in ship parts. Once the space battles began to grow repetitive I found myself completely bored with the game.
* Guild Wars 2: Felt very fun and polished at first, but I never quite made it to endgame. It felt incredibly spammy and the classes felt very homogenized. But man, the combat, so spammy. I also disliked how leveling up meant next to nothing and equipment was practically the same for everyone.
* World of Warcraft: The big one. I actually just made my first character two days ago. I'm currently level 6 and all I've done is walk around killing x monsters for quest y. Over and over. I understand I'm 10 years late to the party, so I don't blame the game, but playing it for the first time in 2014 it looks bad, it plays bad, the spells feel so unfun and the quests are terrible. I've barely played it so I'm not going to make final judgement on it, but if the quests continue at this pace I can't see myself putting in more than another hour or two.

**Preferred Genres (Fantasy, Sci-Fi, etc.):** Any, but a good ship based Sci-fi would be great

**Pricing Model:** Any

**Favorite Features:** Engaging combat - the more skill based the better, smooth and 'flowing' combat (for comparison, WoW and Star Trek's ground combat feel pretty 'clunky'), good ping on Oceanic servers for Australians a plus

**Combat Type**: Any

**Released or Upcoming:** Either, preferably upcoming


Eve Online seems like the obvious choice, but I'd prefer recommendations other than that. It's on my to do list, but currently I feel like it's too big of a time investment from what I've heard, I just wouldn't have time to properly get into it between work and Uni. 




 Just upgraded to iOS7 and I want to change the music app back.

Specifically, I dislike having to scroll through every song to find an album I want. I don't understand why they made this change. I tend to have large collections from my favourite artists and like to listen to lots of different albums. For many artists I listen to regularly I have well over 20 albums. Is there any way I can change the app (settings I've overlooked?) so it goes Artist  Album  Song instead of Artist  Album+Songs. 




 New to this game, just wondering what the general consensus on the state of the game's balance is.

What about specific cards or strategies? 




 I can't even begin to fathom getting angry over something like this. A different set of words were used to sing a song? Why is this making people upset? What negative consequences do they think will happen? Is the average person actually annoyed, or just vocal minority?

 This looks pretty similar to Tribal Wars, a game I used to love a fair bit. However I've heard this is pay to win? Is it true? I don't mind some minor P2W elements as long as I can remain reasonably competitive, but I get no enjoyment out of winning (or losing) based on having spent real money.

TL;DR: How (if at all) P2W is this game? 




 I know these sorts of topics are starting to become a bit disliked here, but I'm really interested in this one.

It's Geralt from the books. He has been hired to slay the beast and thus gets a reasonable amount of prep time (say a few days)/knows what he's getting into. He has all his swords and any potions from his universe available to him. If the monster has a weak point, he is aware of it. The monster is being introduced into the Witcher universe for this battle so Geralt can only use the resources from that universe to create monster traps or whatever will aid him in the battle.

The battle takes place in an environment that the monster has chosen to settle down in. Ie., if the monster likes swamps, it will naturally habitat a swamp somewhere in the Witcher universe for the fight.

Also use a loose definition of the word 'monster'. Basically just keep human-like species and superheroes out of the mix.

TL;DR: What's the strongest monster a fully prepared Geralt of Rivia can beat. 




 I'm sure discussing ideas for new Trek series has probably grown long since uninteresting to everyone here, but I'm going to give this discussion a shot anyway!


When would be the best timeframe for a new Trek series to be set? For example, do you think the technological advancements made at the end of Voyager would make a post-Voyager Trek too uninteresting setting? By 2400~, Starfleet has already created technologies that allow a ship to be modified to go toe to toe with multiple Borg ships (keep in mind these are just modifications, so the actual ships from 2400 would be even stronger). Time travel also seems to be ridiculously easy and rampant at this point. Would a series set in this point in time deal with too much 'overpowered' stuff and rely too heavily on introducing ludicrously strong antagonists to compensate? And coming up with reasons why X technology can't be used to solve problem Y? 


Could a new Trek series deal with a technological stagnation - or maybe even regression - in a post year 3000 Star Trek (or whenever the Star Trek time travel from Enterprise took place)? Or is this moving too far away from the franchises beginnings?


What about setting a show in the past again (except this time: actually dealing with historical Trek storylines instead of introducing new ones...)? What era would be most suitable for this purpose? Or has all the interesting stuff already been dealt with?


TL;DR: If a new Trek were to be made, when should it be set and why? Keeping in mind this is not for ideas for a new Trek, but rather meant for a discussion of the state of the current Trek universe and what challenges may be present in creating a new Trek, although it's fair if concepts for shows naturally creep in. Just don't give us the script to your pilot ;) 




 After reading on wiki about [Paul Kern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kern) I am curious about a few things. Firstly, the article is very lackluster. Is this case considered to be genuine, and if so, are there any modern theories as to how he lost the ability to sleep?

Secondly, most theories of sleep treat sleep as a regenerative function (some treat it as a way of conserving energy). If sleep truly is a regenerative function, how is it theoretically possible for Paul Kern to have functioned (he reported feeling not-tired 24/7) without sleep?

Lastly, would it be viable to deliberately damage people's brains in the same fashion to eliminate the human need for sleep? What exactly where the drawbacks in Kern's situation? 




 I pretty much listen to no hip-hop, but loves these two albums (that, and Gorillaz). 

Which Kanye albums are closest to these two and what other albums should I try? I'm not actually a huge fan of rapping, but the music itself is growing on me. 




 Kirk, Picard, Sisko, Janeway and Archer have been plucked from their respective timeline (their peak in each series to be precise) and forced to face-off in a showdown of 11 events. The winner in each category earns two quatloos, second place one quatloo, and the worst contender loses a quatloo (can go negative). Who places where in each category and who comes out with the most quatloos?

* **ACAMEDIA**
* Round 1: Kobayashi Maru test
* Round 2: Starfleet grade average (can select own course and electives as per standard Starfleet academic course)
* Round 3: Quiz-off: Five player Jeopardy showdown

* **ATHLETICS AND FITNESS**
* Round 4: 400 meter dash
* Round 5: Tennis doubles playoffs (2nd in command as their partner)
* Round 6: Highest climb of Mount Everest before giving up/dying
* Round 7: Who survives the longest against a Gorn in a cage match (standard wrestling cage).

* **DIPLOMACY**
* Round 8: A series of debates on ethical issues
* Round 9: Best handling of an accidental first contact with a primitive civilization (holodeck so each scenario is starts exactly the same) 

* **MACKIN' ON SPACE BABES**
* Round 10: Who can pick up the most people in one week.

* **BATTLE ROYALE**
* Round 11: A series of 1v1 fights. No weapons, fight in standard TOS uniform. Takes place in a boxing arena. No rules, any fighting style, fight until one contender concedes or dies.

Tennis match, debates and battle royale are all round robin format. Everyone challenges everyone else with a point awarded for a win. Most points to least points to determine final winners of that category.

Edit: My Reddit formatting sucks, this will have to do :) 




 In Call of Cthulhu, he can't outrun a steamship, doesn't have any long range attacks (otherwise he would have blown up the steamship), I'm not sure if his wings are functional and he seems to be limited to physically attacking his targets with his hands and feet. His magic seems to be limited to resurrectiobn.,

I always pictured him as some all powerful reality bender (just based on how people talk about him), but it seems he would lose to any decent military, any moderately high tier superhero in a 1v1, or pretty much any of the major Kaiju, right?

or did I miss something (not at full power?) 




 Basically, what are the best non-canon Sherlock stories?

Also, bonus question: What's the most ridiculous Sherlock to be published by a serious publisher (not just some X-Men/Sherlock crossover fanfic where Sherlock nails Wolverine or some shit). 




 Looking for something to read and wondering if there are any good Trek novels. Any recs? 




 Did anyone find out what he was referencing here? Also, this implies that there actually is an 'official' way Sherlock faked his death, right?

Edit: I'm assuming the airbag explanation was a joke, but assuming it's the real one, I'm still interested to know what the missed clue was. 









 Are there any missables I should take note of in the Witcher 2? For example, the smithy in Flotsam sells a lot of cool diagrams, are they worth buying up now for later use? Or will I always be able to get the diagrams?

What about missable quest arcs? 
























 No weapons, no armour, etc.

Just an all out brawl. 




 Basically, which classic rivalry (Sherlock vs Moriarty, The Joker vs Batman, Goku vs Vegeta, etc.) is the most one sided.

Try not to include matchups that are obviously one sided (like comedic relief villains) or small time/one off villains, I'm looking for classic matchups that spread over the life of franchises. 




 Vulcans, Klingons, Jem'hadar, Humans, Romulans, Cardassians and Gorn.

As I understand, Vulcans are the strongest. Even Vulcans who don't seem to actively engage in physical fitness seem to be very strong. I believe Sisko said a fit Vulcan is three times as strong as a fit human.

Apart from that, I've never quite known where everyone else sits. For example, Romulans are meant to be closely related to Vulcans, but they don't seem to have their intelligence or psychic powers, so is their physical strength at all similar?

Klingons are inconsistent. Some times they're taken down in batches by humans they outnumber, yet they're meant to be a fierce warrior race. On the flipside, there is an episode where B'ellana Torres beats a Vulcan in a fight, despite B'ellena not being 100% Klingon or a combat specialist (and looking much scrawnier than the average Vulcan), while the Vulcan was in a rage. Now he may have just been a particularly weak Vulcan, but he certainly didn't seem to be. Apart from that instance, I've always seen their reputation as warrior having more to do with their relentlessness than their actual strength, with them being roughly on par with humans in all aspects bar durability (redundant organs etc).

Jem'hadar are genetically designed to be a super warrior species, but they don't seem any stronger than humans or Klingons. Meanwhile, Gorn are stronger than humans, but slower, meaning a fight could go either way (maybe if Kirk were a boxer he might have been able to outmaneuver and beat the Gorn down?). Also are they stronger than Vulcans? 

Cardassians seem like a wildcard.

Am I on the mark with most of this? Is there an official power ranking index or something (like how Marvel ranks their characters out of 7(?) in categories such as intelligence, strength, powers, etc.)? 




 Who comes 1st, 2nd and 3rd? Who goes the largest sum in Final Jeopardy? 









 Excuse me if I'm getting some details wrong, I haven't seen Voyager since it's original run. Anyway... What limits are there on the Q's power? What is the source of their power?

For example, in "Death Wish" we see Quinn actually transport Voyager to the time of the big bang (and, if I recall correctly, they were 'outside' of it witnessing it, which means Q's powers transcend the very reality they were originally a species of), could will people in and out of existence and all other matter of seemingly omnipotent feats.

However, in The Q and the Grey, the Voyager crew use the Q weapons against the Q, implying that the most powerful tools available to the Q are independent of themselves (not innate, like a God) and can be interacted with by any physical being. So this raises a bunch of questions:

1) Do the Q still have innate powers in addition to their weapons? If not, how did Quinn manage to use the Q weapons despite being exiled? If so, how do they compare?

2) Where are these weapons/tools located?

3) Does this extend to all (seemingly) omnipotent Star Trek races?

4) Are the Q physical entities using these weapons from a remote location, or have they 'transcended' beyond physical form? If the latter, how did Q intend to incorporate physical DNA into a non-physical entity.

I'm sure a lot of these questions are unanswerable, but the Q were always one of my favorite species and I hated the treatment they got on Voyager and thought maybe there's some canonical explanations I've overlooked for some of these questions. 




 I still prefer mouse+keyboard for the most part, but there are a few games where I like to whip out my PS3 control (Dark Souls, Castle Crashers, Batman: Arkham series to name the games from this year) and it would be a nice option to be able to play these on my television.

So basically what should I know before I buy a new TV? Can someone post some estimated minimum specs for running, say, Dark Souls II at max on a 50in? 









 Wasn't even on the front page yesterday (unless I overlooked it) now it's number 1. I usually only see this sort of surge during tournaments, but there doesn't seem to be one running. 




 Anything similar to any of his albums, I feel like I've listened to them all 1,000 times and love them all. 




 Just played my 9th game of online matchmaking, I'm bronze league. Just got placed against a guy who stomped me. I checked his profile after: 1999 career games, has been placed in diamond league repeatedly in the past. I've played against several silver and gold players as well.

Why am I being matched against players like this? What's the point of the leagues if I get matched against players outside of them? The game is a lot of fun, and playing against more experienced players will probably help me learn faster, but doesn't it kind of make a lot of games a complete stomp? Or do I just need to play more to get placed in a more reliable bracket? 









 I've just started playing, is there a particular order I should learn the races in? I feel the Protoss are probably the easiest, but I find them to be a bit boring, but I don't think my macro is good enough yet to use the Zerg. Humans seem easiest after Protoss.

I'm going to look at some beginner Zerg guides, but should I just stick to getting used to the game through Protoss first? Or is it OK for a beginner to just jump right in to any race? 




 Particularly want to hear from Uni lecturers/TA's. 









 Particularly, the thumb pads. I really was never a fan of touchscreen devices because they lack tactile features and feel a tad more unwieldy. 














 So my brother is overseas at the moment and I wanted to get him some Steam games so we can play together for Christmas. Thing is, I already mailed his physical present to him before I got this idea, and 7 days from XMas is too short notice to get another to him. So I thought of doing it digitally. But instead of buying him a game, I thought I could just gift $50 to spend as he pleases.

Is there an option to just fill someone's Steam wallet with a message like you would get if you sent them a game? 




 I understand this is an Alpha, so please don't confuse this with complaining - I'm just genuinely curious to know if there's more to the game than I'm seeing.

So far, I've just run around an empty landscape, occasionally bumping into other players who do very little before wandering off. I have played for 40 minutes and have encountered two zombies - both of which just stood still clawing at the air. This was on two different servers. Every house I explore seems completely empty, there is next to nothing to interact with except for looting bodies (which means nothing because there are no zombies to use the loot against) and opening doors.

I understand I have to eat and drink, but I don't really want to play a game that revolves around wandering aimlessly until I'm thirsty.

I thought maybe the zombies would get more aggressive the more I played, but that makes little sense considering I'm playing on shared servers of 40 people.

Are these just garbage servers? Or is this a common first experience with Dayz?

I fully intend to give it another shot tomorrow, but I'm still just not sure what to expect - if anything. 














 It just seems like a bunch of aimless posts of creepy pictures and 'clever' sayings. 





























 I'm currently watching G-League on the lowest graphics setting and still getting hiccups. I never have issues with any other video or streaming services, but using Twitch is just aggravating. Even switching graphics quality can take 10 minutes with multiple page refreshers because the damn thing doesn't load half the time.

So are there any alternatives for streams outside the Dota client? Or do casters stream solely through Twitch? 




 In this position here: http://imgur.com/mROv9I7

is it a good trade to take the Knight and follow up by taking the other pawn? In other words, is it worth trading my Bishop for a pawn and a Knight?

I rarely play Chess, but over the past week I've been getting hooked, and I've been doing that trade as much as possible, because hey, two pieces for one. But I'm still unsure if the Bishop has equal value to a Knight or not, or if that center pawn is really even that big of a deal early on.

Also if there's a better place for Chess noobs to ask questions, mind directing me there? 









 Hey fitness.

I started running a month and a bit back to get into shape. At first, I would do one hour sessions with great physical difficulty, but no real mental difficulty. However, after the initial 'feel good' of finally getting into exercise wore off, I started to get really bored while running. I used to go just about every day of the week for an hour, now, while I still get out for a run every day, some sessions are as short as 10 minutes. I just start counting the minutes, completely mind numbingly bored. I still look FORWARD to running each day, so my motivation is still there somewhere, it's just when I'm actually on my run that I just want it to end.

Tried listening to music, but I find it gives me headaches having my earphones in for extended periods every damn day, and music isn't really something I can listen to unless I'm in the mood to really get into an album anyway.

tl;dr: Running is boring, how do I keep myself from going braindead through extended sessions. 









 Alien autopsy videos, personal stories, pictures, etc all welcome.

No need to get into much of a debate over whether this stuff is real or not, I don't believe in any of that stuff myself. I'm just interested in seeing what it took others to be convinced. 




 Is there any real need for a cover up? 




 What are the best movies that deal with the possibilities of Alien life? I'm looking for stuff that isn't quite so focused on horror or action, although I wouldn't be against that sort of stuff.

To give an idea, stuff like Contact that deals more with the impact a discovery like that would have on society, or 2001: ASO that keeps the aliens more 'mysterious'. But really, any suggestions are fine. Preferably obscure as I've likely already seen all the bigger stuff. 




 Does music make it easier to get off? 




 The slingshot around the sun to travel time trick: seems relatively simple for what it accomplishes. How did this go unabused throughout all of Trek history, especially from TNG onwards where more powerful ships would be able to achieve the feat even easier. 




 I've read a couple of posts about nerfing Midas considering it's current popularity, but I'd rather not see the item itself get a direct nerf. Instead, how would you feel about the following changes:

* Midas now limited to two per game per team
* Store starts with one Midas
* A new Midas is made available 8 minutes after the first is purchased the first

The effects of the change: No more Midas gaming. You now have to decide which two of your heroes get the benefit of Midas, encouraging more team decision making. Additionally, the timing of your team's first Midas affects how quickly you can get your second Midas, making first Midas timing more crucial.

What other changes could be made instead? Or is Midas overrated and not actually in need of a nerf (just another fad)? 




 I just finished reading this post
http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=132837823

now I've heard of the Deep Web before, but I always just assumed it was nothing more than a general term for website that were overlooked by search engines due to being low priority, however the post has confused my understanding of it.

So what exactly is the 'deep web' and how can I access it? Also, are the claims about the Deep Web in that post accurate? Especially the stuff about being watched by authorities? It makes it sound like every user of the Deep Web is some shady hacker or nutjob who will just randomly aim to ruin my life for simply browsing the web. Like an Internet Cartel or something... 




 So, with all the drama of the Netolic league and previous leagues reportedly not fully paying their casters, item creators or rewards to teams (TPL), I got to wondering what kind of quality control Valve has for tournaments. 

Ticket sales are obviously a huge source of revenue for tournament organizers, so I imagine a lot of this drama would end if Valve were to be a bit harsher on organizers mishandling tournaments. Does anyone know how easy it is to get a tournament ticket into the Valve store and what kind of regulation they have in place? 




 Here's an idea: gems that track records for single games instead of cumulative values. Throw a "Most Last Hits" or "Quickest BattleFury" gem on any of Antimage's items and keep track of your records. If you break your record, it could be informed to everyone on the scoreboard at the end of the game. There are, of course, some obvious downsides such as people deliberately drawing games out in order to beat old records, so maybe some care would have to be taken when selecting types of records to track in order to prevent the system being gamed.

For fun, some more examples:

Weaver: Lowest HP on timelapse

Pudge: Best Hook Hit to Miss Ratio (must throw at least 15 hooks in the game), Most Self Denies

Bounty Hunter: Most track gold

General: Most Kills, Assists, Roshan's, wards placed, etc in a single game, quickest time to hit level 25, least kills in a game you won, Most last hits in first x minutes of game, quickest time to take a tower, quickest time to win a game

and so on. 




 Without spoiling anything other than what I am about to ask, what season do they start appearing on screen? Also do they begin to appear frequently, or is it just the occasional once off? Are the aliens all of the same race? 




 Currently watching Speed Gaming VS DK Game 2 (slight spoilers) and I'm currently looking at 6 Midas' in the game right now.

Why is a 14 minute Midas on Alchemist acceptable in this patch? Why is  Midas a priority for supports instead of quick Mek's? I understand Midas' being more popular in the current patch because higher passive gold means you can reliably get it sooner and more quickly recover your forgone early game after getting a Midas, but is the passive gold gain really enough to explain getting multiple Midas' on the same team and getting Midas' as late as we're seeing?

Are there other aspects of this patch that benefit mass Midas? 




 The wiki page mentions that the PC release date was delayed, but the sidebar doesn't distinguish between PC, PS3 and X360 release dates. Does anyone know if they are the same? 
























 Round 1) An outright no rules street fight. Rocky gets boxing gloves if he wishes and fights in his shorts, the enemy gets whatever weapon they are most synonymous with (Han Solo gets a blaster, Vader gets a lightsaber, etc). Use of The Force is permitted, no vehicles or ships etc.

Round 2) A boxing match. No weapons, boxing gloves are optional.

Round 3) Same as round 1, but with Star Trek characters

Round 4) Same as round 2, but with Star Trek characters

Any Star Wars/Trek character from any canon is permitted. It is peak Rocky and he gets a montage before each fight.

Could he beat Chewbacca? 




 I need to pass a fitness test that requires: 25 pushups, 45 situps and an 8 on the shuttle test score.

I can easily beat the 25 pushups and shuttle run score, but I've never done a situp in my life. I can't even manage one. The form they want you to use is placing your hands on your lower thigh and move them along your leg up to your knee. I can get about 2/3 of the way up there and just can't get any higher. I can't even do one rep. I DO NOT get anyone to hold my feet down, I have to do it unassisted.

I need to be able to pass by the end of the year. What's a good place to start? 




 And if I fail, do I have to pay the full $990 course fee again, or can I just pay to sit the exam? 



















 Where there more people at Wayne Enterprises that new of Batman's identity? What about the military people contracting these designs? Or the people working on parts not made by Wayne Enterprises (perhaps the Batmobile's engine was made by Rolls Royce specifically for that vehicle? They found the wreckage in the tunnel in The Dark Knight and very few large projects like that are all designed by the one company, let alone by a small enough group to keep it all hush hush.

Is Batman being associated with Wayne Enterprises perhaps quite well known and just kept on the down low due to one big non-disclosure agreement? 
























  Last trophy I need for platinum. 




 The difference between just making contact with my body with the ruler and pressing hard in against my 'fat pad' yields and extra half inch. How am I supposed to be doing this? 
























 [This applies to Wiggles canon (TV shows, in character performances, books, etc) and not the irl Wiggles band who fill these roles.]

He stays awake, writing the songs, choreographing the dance moves and  managing the band. It's pretty clear that Murray has no interests outside of screwing around on his guitar, while Anthony is a pure food obsessed hedonist. Greg doesn't seem to have any active interest or hobbies outside of performing at all. So who is the hard worker churning out all those hits? Of course, it's Jeff.

Despite supposedly sleeping all day, he still manages to know all the words, music and moves. Why? Because he wrote it. He wrote all of it. And the rest just piggyback off his success. Not that he cares, everyone seems happy with this arrangement. I mean, how often do you get to sleep on your job without anyone getting angry with you? 









 Woah 














 I have one listed on the Steam market, but no one has bought it (it's been there for a few months). I even keep lowering the price. 







































 It's pretty common to see a King or second to the throne inspiring his troops from the front lines, before leading the soldiers into battle from the head of the pack. Was this common? If not, did it ever happen? How frequently would Kings actually join the fray? 









 Basically, I've been travelling a lot lately and this is the first day I've had to get on the Internet in two weeks, so I haven't kept up to speed with this game. I am about to go without Internet for awhile again in a few hours and I'm thinking of picking up a single player game to kill some time.

So, tl;dr, how crucial is the co-op to fully 'experiencing' this game? Is it like Borderlands, where I can still enjoy it single player, or is it more like Left 4 Dead where the emphasis is on multiplayer? 



















 You can use http://www.redditinvestigator.com/ to find out. I'm not sure how accurate it is, but I'm pretty sure it's right in my case. 




 A lot of good suggestions are making it to the front page today, so I thought I'd take a moment to suggest something I think Dota has needed for a long time: heroes should fart when they die. 

Honestly, I fully expected to have this feature by the time the game got out of beta, but that felt like a lifetime ago now. I think this should be added before TI5 as a priority feature, but they'll need to start ASAP if they're going to get all the VA's in to record farts for their characters in time. 


































 Firstly, these videos probably covered a wide time range as I've seen many posted, and it's been awhile since I've watched them so my specifics might be wrong.

At any rate, it was interesting to watch them because they often involved a lot of disarming and grappling. Was the common soldier trained in these techniques and if so, did they translate well into actual battles? Or was it more for 1v1 sparring and showfights? Kind of like how you learn a lot of advanced martial arts techniques, but when an actual fight breaks out you'll probably just use a basic grapple and pummel your opponent anyway? 









 Just want to know if I should buy now or hold out for a GOTY edition down the track. 




 Also if it's the latter, and my Plus subscription ends, do I get them back if I renew? What about save game progress and trophies? 
























 Is there a strict definition for what guides Vulcan logic? 




 Or to suggest that overly sexist and objectifying portrayals increases the average males perception or treatment of women?

Because at the moment it just makes me think of many other arguments from the past: violent videogames will increase crime (they didn't, and crime is at a low while violent games are at their most gory), heavy metal music will lead to Satanism (completely debunked), rise of availability of porn will lead to increased rape (no correlation has been shown, let alone a link).

What exactly are SJWs using as a basis for their beliefs that sexy videogame girls = increased sexism in society or violence towards women in videogames will lead to actual violence committed towards women.

It seems to me like average living conditions in a country, religiousness and experience with women on a day to day basis all seem like they'd be better predictors of sexism and ill treatment of women than fucking videogames. (everyone plays videogames these days too, more people than ever, so it's certainly not an exposure issue. Previous generations who don't play games seem more sexist?). However, even this is just speculation, so to avoid sounding hypocritical: I have no idea what factors influence sexism. But I certainly don't see any reason to believe videogames are any more responsible than any other factor at the moment.

Feel free to prove me wrong. 




 Excluding trade spam rooms of course. 














 Rules: Each round takes place in a standard wrestling cage. There is no escape and nowhere to hide, nor are there any weapons. Each fighter is in a pair of boxers, no equipment, no armour, just pure brutal fisticuffs. Force to die or concede wins. Geralt gets potions beforehand.

Round 1: Geralt vs Spock
Round 2: Geralt vs Batman
Round 3: Spock vs Batman 




 And what about this very question? Is this 'listable'? 




 I've never hit level cap in an MMORPG before, but I think this might be the first one I manage to do it in. My question is: What is there to do at that point? What exactly does an MMORPGs endgame involve? Constantly fighting the same bosses over and over again for the chance of slightly better equipment is how I picture MMORPG endgame to work, is this at all accurate? 



















 I just thought it would be funny to watch it from that perspective. A movie about Jim Carrey freaking out over nothing for an hour and a half, then walking out of a door in the ocean.

And all the in universe advertisements (like Marlon drinking his beer slowly in front of the camera) and things like the looping pedestrians/cyclists around his neighbourhood would look ridiculous.
Please tell me an edit like this exists.

**TL;DR: Is there an edit of the Truman Show that removes all references to Truman being in a television show, because that'd be boss** 




 Batman got absolutely stomped in the first fight, but in the second fight he seems to win pretty handedly. It's even at first, but towards the end Batman is shitstomping Bane. Why was the matchup suddenly so even between them at first, and could Batman have continued to keep up and even win without damaging his mask?

Scene for reference [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxqC9LyNo-0)

Also not sure if this entirely counts as on topic for this sub, or if it belongs in another sub. 









 The more obscure the better as I've probably played most games you're about to suggest. Preferably PC, but suggestions from any console is fine. 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y13cES7MMd8#t=50 














 I'm really curious to know what Valve's intentions for it are. 














 And how it will work. Hopefully cosmetic stuff works like L4D2 and doesn't require you to play on a special server. This pretty much killed workshop for KF1 for me. 




 By 'proper' I guess I mean something with some actual depth and story or gameplay mechanics akin to a typical PC or console game. Something that doesn't rely on Internet access, purchases to continue playing, etc.

I know both XCOM and some Final Fantasy games are available, but I've played them all to death in the past. 




 And would I likely get banned? I've always entertained the idea of making a novelty account to collect celebrities opinions on my dick, but would they even see it? Would I likely just get downvoted and banned? Would it count as sexual harrasment/illegal (I wouldn't trick them, I'd be straight up like "Here's my dick, what do you think of it Mr. Musk?")

Even if I only got one in every 20 celebs to reply it'd be worth it. 




 Preferably an action RPG, but anything will do. Something that gives you good control over your stats and ability progression and have the choices actually matter.

Thanks!

Edit: Preferably a little less mainstream. Great suggestions so far, but I have played most of them already! 




 So basically, I'm having trouble getting my speakers to split the sound correctly. I have them all plugged in and they all produce sound, but only for the Left and Right sounds when I run tests. 

[So in reference to this image](http://i.imgur.com/T1yswxO.png), when I run the test, it first tests the left speakers. The speaker that should produce a sound here does. However, so does the center speaker, and the rear left and right speakers. During the test of the right speaker, again, rear left, rear right and the center speaker all produce sounds alongside the right speaker.

It then runs tests for the center speakers, rear speakers and sub - all of which produce no sound from any speaker.

Basically, left and right speaker are working as intended, but all remaining speakers seem to just play both the left and right sounds.

I've clearly set this up wrong somehow. Can anyone walk me through how to fix this? Thanks in advance!

 Firstly, I am Australian, and am assuming most first would countries have similar standards for leave and sick days.

Secondly, referring to CEOs of large multimillion dollar companies.

So yeah, what do their basic 'employee contract' look like in concern to days off? What happens if they call in sick but they're seen at the beach or something? 














 What's it like to have to date/be intimate with people you don't find physically attractive (due to your own limited options)? I can't imagine what it'd be like to have to 'settle'. Do you just overcome it and focus 100% on personality (to me, both looks and personality matter) or do you just partner up out of fear of being alone? HAVE you even managed to have relationships?

Do you feel self conscious all the time? Do you think it's impacted job opportunities? Friendships?

Is it a self imposed unnatractiveness (refusal to workout, etc) or did you just lose the genetic lottery?

TL;DR: How has being ugly affected your life? How do you deal with it? 




 Long story short, started with a Sorcerer build, used Soul Vessel to rebuild into Dex build for new game plus, have 12 Int and Attunement points pushing my soul level up that do nothing. Is there an item I can use to reduce them? I vaguely recall being able to do it in Demon's Souls. 




 Resident Evil 4 was the last RE game I really, really enjoyed. RE5 was good a single playthrough and messing around with a bit of co-op, it was a good game, but it was really where the series started to nosedive. I decided to give Resident Evil 6 and Revelations a shot, but they just bored me to tears. Is the series dead for good? 




 Title says it all. 




 Anything to keep an eye out for? Any must get boss soul weapons/armour?

-Wildcard (you may add on guest from the remaining guests who have appeared on QI from [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QI#Guest_appearances) if you wish).

**ROUNDS**

1) The all out brawl. Who wins? Who is dead last? What about a ranking from first to last?

2) Who was likely the most drunk?

3) Who most likely instigated the argument? 




 I noticed the store page lists ST:O has having Steam achievements. Where can I actually see these? 



















 They got less fun every year, and now we're reduced to a simple badge crafting. I know most people don't pay attention to them, but I think they're a nice touch of fun and fanfare, especially when they introduced unique cosmetics for games like Dota 2 into them last time. 




 This is currently being promoted in a giveaway thread on pcmasterrace: http://dimmdrive.com/

What does it actually do and why would I want to use it? 




 It's in a regular fist fight. No weapons or significant environmental features. Who is the strongest person current Alec Baldwin could beat? What about in his prime? 









 I bought a business and noticed I had only received income from it once over several days of play. At this rate, I don't feel like it will ever pay itself off. Definitely not before I finish story mode. 




 Basically, I remember getting this error about a week after I first got my PS4 and having to fiddle with the network settings for hours. I am getting it again now when trying to access the store any other PSN features. However, I was not getting it at the start of the current attacks, it only started yesterday.

So I'm wondering, is this just coincidental timing with the error returning, or are other users getting this error?

Edit: Australian, if that matters. 




 Again, not trolling, some people may interpret this as a jab at the game. I'm genuinely interested. Is there a breakdown of the costs anywhere? Does that 200 million include marketing costs or a fat paycheck for licensing? Maybe they absorbed engine development costs into it (assuming they built an engine instead of licencing it)?

Where did the money go precisely? 









 Anyone else having issues with this? Doesn't seem to appear in big picture or regular Steam. 




 An ultimate, with a suitably long cooldown (perhaps the longest in the game), that could reverse time by 3/3.5/4 seconds? Everything would be returned to the state the game was in several seconds ago (with the one exception being this ultimate is placed on cooldown).

Aghanim's Scepter allows you to rewind time while dead. 




 Particularly, actual expansions with new quests etc?

I was kind of disappointed to see Dark Souls 2 release three expansions AND a 'remastered' edition within the first year of its release, I regret not just waiting and getting the definitive version. What are the odds of The Witcher 3 taking the same path? Should I pre-order or wait a year or so for a 'complete' version to come out? 




 Are photos like this touched up?

Or are there actually places like this I can visit and see the night that bright? Particularly, the bright red center nebula and the glowing blue and purple stars/galaxies scattered throughout.

What about space photos like this:

I get that nothing is faked, but MOST of that colour is outside of the visible light spectrum right? What would that look like to the human eye? Just black? 




 What are the big teams? The big strats/heroes? Any 'must watch' games from the past few months? 









 Also, does the customs counter in the records page only include the ones you have unlocked? 









 So I've got a pair of Sennheiser HD598s playing both through my PC and iPhone. I'm jumping back and forth between two tracks. One is a 320kpbs track ripped from a videogame. It's the original source file so you can bet it's high quality. The other is a 192kbps mp3 copy of it.

I'm failing to notice a difference between the two tracks, except that one is half the filesize. If I shuffle them and close my eyes, I can't tell which is which. Are my ears simply not good enough? My equipment? Why do people care so much about filetype and bitrate if not? Or do some songs simply compress better than others for whatever reason?

Educate me here audiophiles! 




 Unfortunately neither game seems to have Australian based servers, and I can't be bothered trying to PvP with lag. 




 I haven't played in awhile, but noticed today I am getting bullet bills in the middle of the pack and far more frequent 'good' items. I recently got a blue shell in second place. What is happening? 




 So I was posting on 4chan and (obviously) noticed that have a new captcha where I just have to press a checkbox to prove I am not a robot. How does this work?

I'm guessing users who pass enough captchas get this status, but if that's the case, why do I have to check a box at all? 




 I have a Gateway 3DS if that matters. I am just sick of grinding custom moves on the Wii U and wouldn't mind getting them all unlocked on my 3DS so I can transfer character sets over to the WiiU.

Thanks in advance! 









 What are the typical mistakes in this bracket? What roles should I learn to see the greatest progress? Is it better to play a farming game or an aggression game in this bracket (solo queue). Any guides specifically for this MMR range?

I know it's an awful vague question, but it's kind of hard to improve when I mostly play with people at my skill level (most of my friends are 2.5k MMR). 




 So who was right and about what in this video?

 What are the odds of items dropping? Do I have to just own the Arcana in my inventory or do I need to have it equipped? Does it have to be the PA Arcana? 









 While I'm at it: why was this solution so difficult to come up with? 









 Is it possible to get Druid's bear to stand next to his effigy, and get Druid in bear form? If not... can we have this please Valve? 














 I get an hour or two of cardio each week (15-25 minutes of jump rope most days of the week) and lift a bit of weights to keep some muscle definition.

My usual diet is stuff like chicken/beef stir fry (usually noodles over rice, since it reheats better), chicken or ham wraps/rolls, veggies (usually potato, carrot and broccoli), eggs, hamburgers (homemade) and occasionally red meat like sausages/chops. For breakfast: cereals like Wheat Biscuits, oats, cornflakes and Just Right with fruit once or twice a day (usually apple or banana). Occasionally soups and when I have toast (with eggs) it's wholemeal.

I usually just prepare all my lunches for the week (so one week might be wraps, next week stir fry, next week rolls/sandwiches) so it is a pretty static diet.

Now, the bad things. Once a week I'll usually have either takeout (KFC being my most common, usually a burger, a few pieces of chicken and a water instead of soft drink, followed by pizza, which I absolutely gorge on (I'm not overweight, but I freaking love pizza) and something like apple pie with cream once or so a week.

I can identify that this is a generally healthy lifestyle, but a close family member recently passed away from a heart attack which has me on full paranoia mode. Am I one day going to regret a couple of desserts and weekly takeout, or am I overexaggerating the effects of these bad foods?

Also, is there a better sub to ask this on? I thought of r/fitness, but I thought maybe they'd be more concerned with muscle gain than general health. 









 I finished the game in Grounded (first playthrough). I want to go back and finish it in Grounded + to get all the + trophies, but I also want the fully upgrade/shiv door trophies, which I don't think there is enough materials to get.

Is it possible to go Grounded  Easy + (get the upgrades and collectibles trophies)  Grounded + (for remaining + trophies) all with the one 'Joel'? Or can I only go down difficulties when starting a plus mode?

 For example.

Phone rings

Hello, this is test_subject5355

Hi NS, this is Blank from Blank Inc., how are you today?

I'm good thanks

Now at this point, I usually just stop speaking. However, I noticed that sometimes there's an awkward pause. So I figured I'm doing it wrong and started sayings

I'm good thanks, and you?

Now all 3 times I did this, the person on the other end let out a light laugh. All 3 times. It might be because of how unconfidently I said it or am I not supposed to say that?

This question is probably pretty ridiculous, but I just feel like an anxious mess when using phones (talking over people, awkward silences, so forth) so maybe I'm overanalysing, but I don't know what I'm doing so I thought I may as well ask. 














 I just bought a PS4 and I have an old PS3 account that I forgot the password/DOB to. I contacted Sony support and sent passport for ID and they should be able to give me a new password. 

Anyway, I was wondering if I avoid online features and play games on the default account without creating a PSN account (User1 I think it is) and unlock trophies, can I sync those trophies with my PSN account once I get the password? Or will I have to start again?

Basically:
-Have old PS3 account
-Have PS4
-Unlocked trophies on PS4 profile that currently isn't associated with PSN
-What happens if I associate my old PS3 account with my PS4 profile on PSN? 









 I haven't really been watching lately, has 6.82 had any major impact on picks/strats? 




 Seems to be particularly common in chunks of chicken from stir fries. 









 Just curious, I went through my old family computer and I found a bunch of flash games (Stick RPG, Sinjid: Shadow of the Warrior) that I downloaded years ago. I started playing them again and all my save data is still there. It got me wondering where this data is stored. I'm playing them through Internet Explorer. Is it all stored in my IE cache (as if I was playing them online) or within the .swf? I thought it was kind of nifty going back through this stuff and want to back it up for memories sake, it feels strangely good in a nostalgic way to go through all this old stuff.
Thanks!

 I'm guessing it's because they're more reliable and will generally be better actors, but it always feels really weird. I often watch these movies assuming they're adult learners at small time colleges/unis before someone mentions that they're in high school or something.

It's particularly common in the horror genre. 














 I think this would be a great change. Valve's free to play model should extend to the store itself. Every game sold on Steam should become free to play, and Valve can support it by selling hats for your Steam profile pictures.

Hats could be purely cosmetic, or they can go the TF2 route and make hats 'sidegrades'.

Imagine:

**The Time Saver**

* +35% load time on the Steam store

* -15% quality of images


**The Merchant's Monocle**

* 5% better prices on the Steam market

* Maximum of 10 market purchases allowed a day


**Santa's Christmas Hat**

* +40% chance to receive drops while browsing the Steam store or playing Steam games during Christmas Day

* -75% relationship with your family


I for one think it would be an amazingly profitable venture for Steam, as well as benefiting all Steam users who can now play games as they please.

What other interesting hats would you like to see? 














 In my case, I just got offered a job working 7am to 7pm two days, then 12am to 7am two days with four days off. It basically just rotates like that non stop. While I think I'm capable of doing this and still maintaining a solid 6-8 hours of sleep a night, I was wondering if it would cause health issues?

I really want the job as it would work well with Uni since I'd get four days off back to back frequently to study/classes/assignments despite it being a full time paying job.

Will this be a health issue? What if I only did it for a year or two? 




 I'll keep things brief. I'm looking for a job relevant to my degree. I have taken a full time job in the mean time. They think I'm going to be here for years, I'm just treating it as a temporary job. I have applied for new jobs since then. Odds are, I'll get a smattering of interviews at random times throughout the coming months (not in one big block), so I can't just keep booking sick days or taking random time off throughout the day and my lunch breaks are only 30 minutes.

I have no leave accrued because I've only been working this job for a few days.

What do I do? I feel really trapped in this poor paying job with bad conditions and no career progressions, but I can't quit (financial reasons) and can't find a way to attend interviews for better jobs. 




 Do Americans know who the "Bananas in Pyjamas" are? 




 Is there any specific reason the games on Steam are being released in this order? Will we likely see all Final Fantasy games come to Steam (7, then 8, then 3, then 4, then 13)? It makes it seem like they don't ever intend to release 9, 10 or 5?

Also what are the odds of getting these games? Is there some reason we didn't get 9 after 8? The only reason I can think of for not getting 10 is because of the HD remake recently.

Particularly, will we likely see IX, X and XIII's sequels? 









 OK, so I have these very vague images in my head of a game I played when I was younger. I sincerely doubt anyone will be able to help me as I can't even hold the images in my head very well. But here we go anyway.

It was a PC game, I played it in the mid to late 90s. It was a first person game and I believe it involved you exploring a cave or something. I think early on you get attacked by a bat or some sort of flying creature. I can't remember if it was an FPS or not, but I think it might have been 'on rails' and had cinematic style graphics... I think.

I really can't remember anything else. May or may not have been set on another planet (it involved a lot of alien enemies).

Is there a thorough database somewhere I could peruse to maybe remember a bit better? 

Thanks.

Platform(s): PC

Genre: Unknown

Estimated year of release: 1990-2000

Graphics/art style: I think it was a combination of real life footage and animated? Or maybe entirely 2D. It had a 'realistic' look to it.

Notable characters: None

Notable gameplay mechanics: None

Other details: I don't remember anything :(

 He just takes existing songs and changes the words to something that sounds similar and rakes in $$$. I can't criticize him without being told I hate fun or some shit. 




 Why did we 'invent' capital letters? When did they first appear and how else have they been used throughout history (now, usually for proper nouns and the starts of sentences along with some other niche uses)?

 I was just thinking, something that has helped me deal with my anxiety over the years is forcing myself into increasingly uncomfortable situations until I adjust to it. However, having the Internet has allowed me to avoid many things that could have served as a great means to overcome my anxiety much quicker (mostly to do with human interaction: leaving the house to shop, talk to salespeople, phone calls, etc).

Do you think a rise in Internet availability could be linked with a rise in anxiety? I know it's hard to judge this sort of thing since mental orders in general change their definitions over the years and reporting on the whole is on a rise (people more accepting about or it aware of it).

Is there any research done on this potential link?

 I just finished Chapter 3 and I haven't even finished the first day yet. I've done all the sidemissions that popped up (they felt scarce, tbh) and collected a fair amount of stuff. I remember feeling really pressed for time to do much in the original Dead Rising, but I'm just breezing through this one. I'll be finished well and truly before the six day mark.

Does Chapter progress slow down at all soon - or side mission frequency increase? 




 For example, would the top 10 female tennis players be equal to the top 10 males?  









 It doesn't make them look threatening, it makes them look like props for tourists. Is this actually how they're seen within England? Why can't they just stand still and guard the palace without having to work around like a jackass? 




 Are you still using it? With SteamOS? What are the pros and cons?

The controller is obviously out of date, but how are you enjoying the trackpads?

Edit: I'm referring to the early Steamboxes that have been given out a few months back.
