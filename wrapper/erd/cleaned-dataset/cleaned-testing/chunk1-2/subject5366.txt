 Sept. 24. Duncan's family members tell U.S. authorities this is the day he first felt sick. That is when he likely became contagious.  
 Sept. 26. Duncan seeks treatment at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas and is sent back to his sister's apartment with antibiotics.  
 Sept. 28. Duncan is transported to the same hospital by ambulance. He is critically ill and put in isolation in the hospital's intensive care unit.  
 Sept. 30. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms that Duncan has been stricken with the Ebola virus, the first patient to be diagnosed in the USA.

 He made an insuation that the same would happen to Apple and Google:  
"BlackBerry pioneered the same business model that Google and Apple are doing now. That has not ended well for BlackBerry," Baker told Guardian editor James Ball at the event.

 I wonder how many will be restricted based on starter choice, like X/Y legendary birds, and the game version you pick in the case of duos. 




 Yes, but if it was on a primary mortgage, up to $2 million was forgiven by the [Mortgage Debt Relief Act](http://answers.usa.gov/system/templates/selfservice/USAGov/#!portal/1012/article/3317/Mortgage-Debt-Forgiveness-and-Your-Federal-Taxes).  
That act has been extended previously but I'm not sure if/when it will be extended again. 




 So, more like how Ash 'gets' them in the anime, helping him on his journey. 




 Ya, you do need to do your homework, consult a lawyer, know what to negotiate, etc.  
Once they file that 1099C cancellation of debt to the IRS though, you should be in the clear. 




 These debt collectors will settle for pennies on the dollar. Maybe a few more pennies than they paid for the loan, but they'll normally be willing to negotiate before going to get a judgement. 




 Nope you shouldn't have to, as part of their jobs though they will ask.
