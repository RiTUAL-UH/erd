  Nope. I have heard of some terrible "get 'em any way you can" anecdotes (such as barring entry onto sports teams until they take a 'special bath'), but always within the context of such practices being morally reprehensible. We also have rules for potential converts, such as not baptising those who are underage without permission from their parents.

LOL Did you guys ask Ann Frank's parents before you tried baptizing her a bunch of times? 














 A flight going from Cairo to Johannesburg was about half-way through their trip. Out of the blue, the captain made a startling announcement,

"Folks, it seems as though we are having some engine troubles. Now please remain calm, and we'll have an update in 15 minutes."

Obviously everyone is freaking out. 15 minutes go by. Captain makes another announcement.

"Ok seems as though one of our engines has failed. We are going to make a landing at the nearest airstrip. We'll give you another update in 15 minutes."

People are still freaking out. Another 15 minutes go by. Captain makes his announcement.

"It seems as though the second engine has failed and we're losing altitude quickly. We will be throwing out the luggage to lighten our load. Hopefully this helps our situation."

Utter pandaemonium in the cabin. The captain's voice hushes the people.

"It seems as though we are still quickly losing altitude. We do have emergency parachutes, but only enough for a certain amount of passengers. Now to be fair, we will call upon passengers alphabetically. If your group is not called, then you will receive a parachute. Sound good?"

The passengers begrudgingly agree.

"Now, A, will all the Africans please raise your hand."

No one moves a muscle.

"Ok... B, will all the blacks please raise your hand."

Again, no one moves.

"Fine, C, will all the Coloreds raise your hand."

Still, no body raises their hands. 

A young boy, confused, looks around, and nudges his dad.

"Dad, dad, aren't we all of those?"

"Shhhh, son, quiet, we are Zulu." 




 Yea I know that about those pokemon, but they aren't Ghost type. Or zombie ants. 




 I want 3 pokemon, I want this [ant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camponotus) to be insect, and this [fungus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiocordyceps_unilateralis) to be ghost and grass. Now, since in nature, the fungus zombifies the ant, I want them to special evolve in to another pokemon that's like... ghost and insect. Better than Shedinja.

 Went to dog grooming school for about 600 hours of on job training. Make about 15 dollars an hour (commission, on a slow day). Essentially get to play with puppies all day. Lots of customer interaction. Make people and animals feel and look happy and healthy. Very respective of the LGBT community. Oh, and there's tips!

 When an animal is domesticated, infantilization occurs, just look at the [silver fox](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2010/09/06/mans-new-best-friend-a-forgotten-russian-experiment-in-fox-domestication/) of Russia.

 mocking, i wouldn't use that word. from what i understand, his argument is that phylogenetic trees like these are inappropriate models for dog breeds. the 2nd one addressed some of the issues with cross breeding, but still lacked complete accuracy. i'm going to go with what you said, in that i could be wrong as well.

edit: i'm sure these trees do have some scientific, if not artistic value. that's why i posted this blog, i thought they were beautiful trees.

Point being; is any wild land sacred in Southern California?! 









 Say that I'm 9 months sober for the first time in 9 years. 




 ^ Personally I'm part of that 9%, and 9 months sober. I really only got more in to the addiction aspect from smoking medical grade Colorado bud. I don't mean to rain on anyone's parade, as I am a huge fan of legalization. With legalization though should also come increased mental health awareness and possible drug/alcohol rehabilitation funding. Again, totally a fan of legalization, it just isn't for people with the addiction tendencies (here) or underlying mental health problems that are exacerbated by THC.

 I was in Costa Rica on a river boat tour, and our tour guide just randomly jumped out of the boat without explanation. He jumped from mangrove to mangrove, until he ran to a tree about a hundred meters away and proceeded to climb up the tree. He grabbed a branch, shimmied down, slowly made his way back to the boat. With him, was one of these [guys](http://cdn1.arkive.org/media/7C/7CD5F38B-EC21-4B40-8914-DCF40152145B/Presentation.Large/Pygmy-anteater-in-defensive-posture.jpg), and my love for the silky anteater began.

 I like his teddy bear cut, have you guys tried a diet change or any Angel's Eyes to get rid of the drool stains? I see it all the time and usually suggest those two things. As well as your groomer using the thinning shears to cut them out, but that's just slowing down the inevitable.  









 One of my first serious boyfriends I had. He was 7 years older than me, and my parents were already not thrilled about things. (I mean neither were his... I kind of forced him out of the closet when I would sleep over at his house and wake up with him, oops). So before my dad even got around to meeting my ex, my ex boyfriend sent me a picture of his gigantic penis to my phone. My dad happened to be cleaning, stubbled upon said penis picture on my phone, and proceeded to cuss me out and argue that i break up with him immediately. Yay!

 My father is jewish? So I'm no expert on this subject by any means. Any who... little story. I went on an exchange program to Bavaria in Southern Germany, where I 'attended' [Gymnaisum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(school) for two weeks (it was sweet, we got to go to whatever class we felt like that day). Well... one day i felt like going in to a history class. I didn't realize it at first, but after a few minutes, enough of the little german I knew clicked, and I realized I had walked in to a very in detail class discussion about the holocaust. I mean, man, they talked about things I didn't even know or think about. Ideology, methodology, specific locations, names/dates/times, etc. I was startled, but grateful the truth was out there for the next generation of germans.  




 'Africa' is over [50](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa#Post-colonial_Africa) separate and unique countries.

 I really am thankful for Allies such as yourself in the world. You really give a lot of strength to us LGBT people.

It's a bit outdated, to say the [least](http://www.glaad.org/reference/offensive). Again, thanks for that story, way cool. 




 That level of agnosticism is what I agree with. Especially if said meditation was [daily](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2008/10/relaxation.aspx) 




 I think bowing your head at the cafeteria, and having a classroom moment of silence, are two very different things. We do the Pledge of Alligiance, I think it should be followed by a minute of no conversation or noise. An opportunity for serenity.

 It depends on the state you live in, and whether that state has laws against owning, selling, or owning and selling them.
As a dog groomer myself, I tell my clients two places to find any animal:

 1) A Recognized and Established Breeder 

2) Shelter

Edit) Also, it depends what generation they are and how far removed they are from the serval in their blood line.

 Ok, so as a gay guy, I've actually thought about this a lot. 
As a child growing up, it's hard feeling comfortable in your own skin because everyone else around you seems so normal, and ironically being social and making close friendships with other guys, just makes you feel further alienated and alone. 
So the conversation, "I can change", "I can get cured", "This is happening for such and such reason", replay over and over again in your young, still developing brain.
Then the delusion sets in of, "Well, what if I woke up one morning, and *BAM*, I was only attracted to chicks." It's a sick fantasy I held on to, almost until I came out. 
My answer? I would of probably tried to make it national news, and get other people cured as well. Why let others suffer internally if there was a way out? If I could stop suicide, or drug and alcohol abuse, or a kid from becoming homeless or a prostitute?
Alas, now I'm out, and **proud as fuck**.

 Lol am I right though? Did you not play Gen 1 when it came out? 




 Ehrmahgawd you watched that video too 




 One could say the inverse, that younger fans don't appreciate Generation 1, because they didn't start playing until Generation 3. You make a bunch of valid points, it's just this video is satire. Not something to be Outrage(d) about. 




 Looks like $65 dollars to me. *cough* Sorry, had a bit of a dog groomer moment there. 









 Probably right, since most of the video relates to Generation 1.

Craig sat there sobbing. Throwing his fist at the ground. Screaming. Torrents of tears fell to the ground already splattered in blood.

"Oh my god Craig, we have to get you out of here. There's going to be cops, investigators, detectives, I mean our finger prints are over... wait. She wrote something. This bitch wrote something."

Don doesnt use my name, just keeps me locked up in this little cage all day and night while he fiddles with colonizers, mining for riches as I soil my cage.

My names Bethany; you should remember that, that and Ive been trafficked here for fucks and giggles.

Well, its been about 4 months since Don found me on a personal ad, drugged me, raped me, trapped me in a small box, and kept me in his work building on the Mars colony.

I only know where I am because of passerbys shooting the shit about the glories of space expansion.

No, I cant talk back, hes got a ball gag in my mouth, Don isnt that stupid.

I also know something thats quite interesting about the room Im trapped in, and that is that it contains quite a large amount of explosives.

I dont like to toot my own horn, but I know a thing or two about blowing buildings up to high heaven, in this case THE heavens.

During his last fuck-and-go, I managed to fiddle up a spare lighter from the sleaze bag's pocket and jam up my well, you get the point.

 Sorry you feel that way, just trying to educate someone with poor word choice on a public platform. We are equals.

 I wouldn't say the worst, because I'm so used to it by now, but anal gland excretion.  




 Also, 'homosexuality'. Here's a GLAAD [page](http://www.glaad.org/reference/offensive) that talks about that word as well. Internet can be educational too. Not just a place to perpetuate shitty vocabulary in the honor of 'tradition'. 




 I was grooming two [American Straffordshire Terriers](http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/images11/AmericanStaffordshireTerrierMountbrierfarms935without.jpg), really easy, just a basic bath, with some light brushing and a nail grind. Well I was grinding one of the dogs nails, and I looked away for a second to answer a coworkers question, and she didn't like me just holding up her paw. She growled for half a second and snapped her jaws about an inch from my face. I heard her teeth. Finished the nails quickly. Took a break immediately. Sat smoking a cigarette with my hands shaking like I had Parkinson's.

2) Hey,man, that's just like, your opinion.

3) Procreation and advanced societies don't necessarily correlate. "First World Countries" tend to have fewer babies, not more. More birth control, abortion, planned pregnancy. Essentially, people fucking in the butt.

4) First Nation Americans, Tahitians, Mesoamericans, Indians, I'm sure I'm missing a few others, but shoot, send me a message and i'll send you towards a whole bunch of historical websites on gay and transgendered relationships and social structures throughout history! Yay learning!

5) Try using the word gay. 'Homosexual' comes off as offensive. Makes me feel like I'm a monkey in a cage. But what do I know. I'm just a gay man in a straight man's world.

 Ex boyfriend fucking some dude with a girlfriend. *Justgayguyproblems* 




 Dog grooming, I play with puppies and make them look cute for money.

Edit: Why might I hate it? Occasional poop. 




 "It is a girguin,

A swephant, and last, a seer.

I haiku'd that pic."

It'd be like The Fly, except all of those spliced animals would be chasing me.

 Their preferred food is [blood and flesh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxpecker#Diet_and_feeding). 









 No, just that we forced them to convert to Christianity and assimilation schools... 




 I don't know about all of it coming from Cracked... maybe Wiki... my submission came from a dog breeding website. 




 Also one of the last spots on earth to find a wild [cuban iguana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclura_nubila) 




 I would look in to Two-Spirited folks. We kind of fucked them up with our beliefs in sexuality and gender. Examples of same sex relationships and transgender folks exist aplenty in First Nation history. 




 Wasn't this on Cracked.com? 














 [OP's right, so hot right now](http://aiminglow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/mugatu.jpg) 




 Do you stay classy? 




 Can our state splitting in to 6 different states positively affect the draught situation our state is going through right now? I hear that argument used, and it sounds logical, just wondering your thoughts on the proposition. 




 Why is it that you wish to run against a fellow democrat, incumbent or not?  




 Also to lighten the mood, here's my tortoise eating rose petals
...Because this whole thing kind of made me cry watching it. they're incredible and fascinating animals. there's no need for one to go through pain like this.

 Carpet bugs? 




 I also don't think you're a big breasted blonde girl that makes gifs. Again, so gay can't tell even if you were. ^Life 




 Dachshunds bite the most. Siberian huskies that are well behaved are far and in-between (I have one myself, [Ki](http://imgur.com/a/Lihhr) who I usually have to muzzle when I work with him). Cocker spaniels are usually great, but can have temper tantrums randomly. Chow-chows are known to do the same, just more frequently. I have to say, I love working with miniature schnauzers, just not when it comes to their feet. 




 I... don't know what that means. 




  Nah this just means the pup got groomed at PetCo, they give groomed dogs little bandanas. Source: groom dogs, and I've previously worked there.

Hopefully this helps?

 




 Hi, /u/StickleyMan, can you explain what Brazzers is? Or am I just too gay to function? *That last one is possible*. 




 I want a grooming van. No joke. I like my Jetta just fine.

Shelties are the shit! Make sure to find a good breeder, as recently, the breed standard has been for a narrow cranium, which has lead to a whole host of neurological disorders.

Other than that, need plenty of mental stimulation and exercise, basic to groom, just daily brushing, bath every few weeks.

 I grew up watching this guy, never thought twice about how funny it was till now. Huh. 




 [This](https://drawception.com/pub/panels/2012/5-16/RGybqrANnD-12.png) comes up on google when i search your username. I think it's just sad to begin with.

 I think Europe is good on life. Just saw Germany win the World Cup. 




 Hi Bill!
I grew up watching your shows in the classroom, and those shows helped blossom my interest in science throughout the years to such an extent! Thank you so much.
My question relates to extinct/endangered species and this current Holocene extinctionary period, and what we can do to prevent some of the loss.

I understand that certain institutions exist that preserve endangered and extinct animal DNA and bodily samples, such as [The Frozen Zoo at the San Diego Zoo](http://www.sandiegozooglobal.org/what_we_do_banking_genetic_resources/frozen_zoo/), with the hopes of maybe one day being able to recreate these species, such as what they did with the [Banteng](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Clone-of-endangered-species-succeeds-Angus-cow-2656880.php). You hear people talking about wanting to bring back the mammoth, or thylacine.

Some scientist, such as [Dr. Paul Martin](http://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Mammoths-Extinctions-Rewilding-Environments/dp/0520252438) actually wanted to sustain large numbers of ice age megafauna on the U.S. continent, brought in from other parts of the world.

My question is this: do you believe our resources are better spent conserving the life that currently exists on this planet, further preventing mass extinction? Are these ideas of resurrection too 'sic-fi' and farfetched to be beneficial in the name of biodiversity? 

Again, thank you so much for inspiring generations of kids around the country.
Cheers. 




 Shiny Golbat in Emerald. He was so adorable... I miss him.... So pink, so fresh.... 




 I've never heard 17 before. I live next to a condor sanctuary, and worked at one of the places that brought the population back. 




 [huge community of black jews in Israel, wouldn't be surprised if some of them are gay, cause, well, some people are gay. go figure.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Israel) 









 Did that yesterday. My client was like, "You were amazing! I've never seen anyone do it look that! It was like you were shoeing a horse." I told my coworker, her response was, "Whatever, we all fucking do it like that." 









 Gee thanks :D 




 That's the program I want to get in to! Along with 800 other people from around the world per year for 50 spots! 




 Sorry to hear that. If it's better than Ventura, I'm in Moorpark. More gibbons. 




 [it begins](http://weeatny.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/zombie-450x560.jpg) 




 Ah mah gawd the strawberries here in Ventura County are so good it's insane. And I grew up in Orange County, near Irvine, which has strawberry fields everywhere (at least it did.... sad... development....) 




 [omg, what do you mean, the show is so good and fresh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKS3MGriZcs) 




 What's the story behind this amazing piece of video? 














 I also noticed, I'm so jewish, I looked at that picture from right to left, and described it as such. 




 It is a girguin,

A swephant, and last, a seer.

I haiku'd that pic. 




 HOLY SHIT I LOVED THIS BAND THANK YOU SO MUCH.

edit: listened to them back in high school (2004), and this just made me so happy to hear them again. 









 A zebra, probably a Lybra, she was caught in my gaze

Like her distant cousin in pun, his starstruck.

Now a thirsty tiger like myself can't pass

A thick slice of that rump roast toasting in

My stomach by the moonlit sky on cocaine,

So of course I made one of those "Purrs you

Folk seem so interested, fascinated by; innocence.

That fat beast got on her fours and crawled

Towards the worst motherfucker in that place,

I proceded to lick my lips in anticipation, excitement.

Hours to the powers of infinite Algorithmic numerals

Passed by as I could taste that smooth red nectar,

That rotting smell in her nether region that enthralls,

Orchestrates the crowds to pull a Wagner Finale.

As my dead mother once snarled, "Patience, shithead.

And oh how she was so on the forehead! 

Seize the night!

I couldn't hold myself; claws extracted and my muscles

Pulsated in the direction of the flesh I was tearing off.

All I needed was a good grip, just the tip to tip the

Domino towards her larynx and esophageal passage.

Crush wouldn't even begin to describe the sounds that

Exuded out of her meat hole, snout flaring; fireworks.

I was bathing in showers of punctured pipelines giving

Oxygen not to her dying vivacarcass, but to my brain.

Puss, bile, feces, lymphatic fluids, bacteria I can't even say,

It all tasted like the best ecstasy I ever bought from a South Korean.

I mean honestly I'm surprised no one else said anything,

How embarrassing, there must of been sixty, seventy, other

Large Organisms in that same room, not to mention smaller

Non-invited creatons, protazoa, shit that can live for millennia.

I could of swore some of my saliva with that zebra's amniotic

Fluid got all over a Brown Hyena here for business, his markings

Only added to the stench of the carnaged carrion caf-carnival

(It's pretty much Lucifer meets your pretentious local French coffee place).

Some aardvark tried smelling up the flailing body, but I made it

Clear with my urine that my domience was in this territory.

And her breathing stopped.

Well someone had to break the ice, you know all those carnivores

Were in that kill from head to toe to tail to vestigial sense of empathy.

The plant eaters took the chance to sneak in some round two and three

Cud chewing, or in the various Rodentia, Lagamorph, anything else

Not so fucking flinty that I couldn't outrun a scary thought,

Whatever weed grows in the ever blood filled cracks in the grey

Cement layed on the backyard patio, I told him to do wood panels.

Everyone was in a feeding orgy, death brought life and some great

One on one on two on one on three beastial, primordial sexual

Encounters of the thirteenth kind, unlucky to the fallen soldier,

God Bless the flesh we are about to produce into skat, not rats.

But wait,

You are sitting on your pedestal thinking, "What a crazy tale, 

You corky, illmanered feline of an endangered speiciest deity.

You talk about death and violence like the weather, promotion,

Remotion from the motion you stir in our community, THE CHILDREN!

Sir, I'm pro-you-gonna-die, and that watermelon of a sense of morality

You're juggling on your head neglects one major factor.,

You can't run the jungle with out killing some fuckers.

Heads getting a roll, dinner plates go to my mate, you do you

And I'm gonna go ahead and do me while I finish this bitch Zebras

Blood covered tang smeared all across my nose;

CAN YOU SMELL THE FREEDOM? 









 I shared this with a friend. I told him it was sexuality in the modern age. He just said it was dark.
