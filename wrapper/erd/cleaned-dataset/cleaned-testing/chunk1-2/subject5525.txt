 Yeah, a little. Like holding pennies in your mouth. 




 First, the whole Betsy Ross thing...probably false. She didn't design the flag, and certainly didn't sew it in front of the fire at the old home place. (She did sew Navy flags, and she may have had some business is manufacturing flags, but their is no evidece of this, other than anecdotal.)

The first "American" flag was probably the Continental Colours, which flew over Washington's Boston headquaters in the early years of the Revolutionary War. (This version of the flag was the first to be "recognized" as the flag of the United Colonies when on November 16, 1776, the American warship, Andrew Doria, saluted a Dutch fort in the West Indies and was saluted in return. 

The first official national flag, also known as the Stars and Stripes, was approved by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777.

After Vermont and Kentucky were admitted to the Union, two more stripes and two more stars were added to the flag. This is the "Star spangled banner" that Francis Scott Key saw that inspired him to write the song.

In 1818, after five more states had gained admittance, Congress passed legislation fixing the number of stripes at 13 and requiring that the number of stars equal the number of states.

By law, adding PR as a state will require an additional star to the US flag. [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States#Future_of_the_flag) are a few of the possible designs for a 51 star flag. (Also a good wiki article on the US flag.)


 




 No, but I once used her period for a bloody mary. (Salty, but somehow okay.) 




 You didn't let him in on the pregnancy, and you didn't want his input on your abortion...telling him now will result in either a "WTF? Who are you again?" moment, or a great deal of emotional distress. Leave it be. 




 Hmmm. I need one of these. To teach my dog how to do something. You know, something.  




 I'm glad you circled it...I was so amazed by the 500% return on penny stocks that I totally didn't notice the FRACKIN' DEMON BABY WITH FOUR EYES!! 




 New Smyrna is Volusia Co. 




 Currently ambivilent, but if I found out that any of our local ptp courses were slowing down course development, I would change my mind quicklike.

We've got a nice blend here on the East Coast of Florida...most local courses are freebies (Daytona Beach area). Inland, we've got Bill Frederick's Park...not a traditional ptp, but you have to pay to get in the park, so...it is. But in trade you get two extremely well taken care of courses, an on-site pro shop, plus the park itself is outstanding. (You talk about undesireables...BF Park does keep out the undesireables...no homeless, no school skippin' kids...not a bad trade for the five bucks or less it costs to get in!)

Nearby we also have an Executive DGC. It's true PTP, around 10 bucks if I remember, but again, you get what you pay for. This course is attached to a ball golf course, so with pay you get access to the club house, the bar, you can rent golf carts, they have a beverage cart (BEER GIRL!!!) My only complaint about that course is the lack of improvements...it's still in its "Just opened" state...but still...BEER GIRL!!!. 




 Done. I hate facebook. 




 LyinRyan kinda looks like Anthony Hopkins' younger weirder brother. 




 I'm a big talker, and very opinionated, and suffered from coming off as an aggressive prick for a while. I learned to change. Here's what I did.

-First, tone of voice. There's an in-between being loud and confident and diffident and standoffish. Use a smooth voice, dampen your inflection, ask more questions, and keep your sentences and your point short. Don't interrupt. And listen, and show that you're listening by making eye contact, and nodding where appropriate.

-Second, correcting someone is one of the hardest things to do without seeming like a total ass. I learned to tell when I needed to correct someone, and when I just wanted to. The best way to not come off as a dick when correcting people, is to stop doing it when it's just not that important.

Third, and most important, is body language. Watch what you do with your hands, don't make aggressive movements. Keep your stance open, be aware of what faces that you're making. When you can learn to control the message your body sends, it becomes easy to become an entertaining master of information and knowledge, without people hating you for being smarter than them. 




 Sister Hazel - All for you...in my ass. 




 Is that a cow, or Fozzie the Bear? 




 Let me tell you why you're not:

You're in college right now. You've picked a major, and still find time to be active in sports. Even with that dense schedule, you're maintaining a GPA of almost 3.0. You're so motivated in your physical fitness that you sometimes overextend yourself and make yourself late. Even then, you make time to get to your class, and then when your prof gives you hell for being late, you have enough pride in yourself, even in a class you don't care about, to feel bad for not meeting basic expectations. You're some combination of lucky/skilled/smart enough to have your tuition paid for, along with some living expenses. You have parents that are willing and able to help you with rooming expenses, and prideful enough to feel bad about needing their help. You have tried to lessen their financial burden by taking in roommates when you could. You are going to graduate college soon, and hope to apply to the California Teaching Credential Program. You look forward to having some time to go to work for yourself, and to spend some of your own money to further lessen the burden on your parents (who, by the way, know enough to not let you burden yourself with a student loan, which will follow you for half of forever). Anyways, long story short, you wish that you could be a little more self reliant, and wish that you could show your parents just a little bit more success in return for their investment, and recognize how lucky you are when there are so many around you that don't have it quite so well.

So. First, tell you parents thank you. Heartfelt. Let them know how much their help means to you.

Second, Step up your game just a bit. From what you've said here, you're doing better than a lot of the kids I went to college with.

Third, if you really feel bad about other students not having the tools to succeed, try some volunteer work, change what little bit of the world that you can change, and take joy in that change.

tl;dr Man the fuck up, do a good job, and call your mom. 




 Nah, the world has enough whiny bass players. 




 Practice, practice, practice.

Pick a song that you know really well on guitar. Make it easy on yourself, and go with something not hard. Four chords and a chorus, you know. And just practice it, over and over again.

The biggest thing is to train yourself to not quit when you flub. Keep going, play the whole song. Eventually, you will become accustomed to doing both at the same time, and it will become easier for you, but you will have to continue practicing, forever. 




 Run Ronnie Run is retarded funny. David Cross/Bob Odenkirk and the gang from Mr. Show. Too. Freakin'. Funny.  

Though Mandy's bit is just a cameo, but it sums up the plot of the movie fairly well.

 Greetings from the NSB!

Are you familiar with the story of the Tampa Monkey? (Monkey on the loose in the Tampa area for a couple of years now...making WC look a little silly in their attempts to catch). 

And better question...how do we learn to live with our animal neighbors? How many of these animals are actually dangerous and how many are being removed for just being a nuisance? 




 Powder up! 

I'm a Florida flinger, so I know something about hotballrash. First, keep 'em dry. Starts out of the shower...don't put your britches on wet balls. Dry 'em first.

Powder up! Especially if you're wearing drawers that rub that upper-thigh area. Bring some powder with you, and address as necessary. And remember...Talcum before it hurts, cornstarch after it's too late! And stay away from that medicinal Gold Bond shit...it's like thousands of angry ice-elves prospecting for gold on your sack. Terrible.

Drawer choice. Believe it or not, throwing down here in the heat, and the humidity, I wear board shorts...with those crazy net underwear sown in...and I never have the sackrash. Never. Might try it out, it's a little uncomfortable for the distance you'll be walking, but that shit keeps the old meat and two veg nice and airy...and airy means dry...and dry balls are happy balls. 




 There are plenty of recipes out there that you can search up, and I'm sure someone will come along and help you, but let me tell you what I do when I'm heavy a bunch of seasonal fruit.

Make flavored simple syrups. 1 cup of fruit, smashed, pitted, and peeled, 3/4 cup of sugar, 1/3 or so cup of water. Cook. Strain. Store cold. Lasts for a couple of weeks. Use it in fruit drinks, cocktails, dessert recipes. If you have a ridiculous amount, put some in ice trays, cover with plastic wrap, and store in the freezer. Use in recipes as needed.

Also, make and freeze mashed fruit. Store in icetrays as above. Throw in fruit recipes.

Happy baking! 




 Puckered-Ass-Conservative?

 




 Well, he seems pretty angry, and willing to disregard the positive aspects of the United States, but if you rewrote what he said in a way that he didn't seem like he was foaming at the mouth, a lot of what he said would ring true. We Americans, on the whole, are terribly mis- and uninformed about our country and its policies.

The major difference that I have with the poster is that I still believe that America can change...but I have to admit that I am losing hope. 




 Light is different when there is no atmosphere. Both Earth and Mars have one. The conspiracy that the moon landing was faked has been debunked enough times already.  




 I'm Mitt Romney, and I approve this message. 




 I just recently read the wiki article about EHS. I had no idea what to call what was happening in my head. I haven't had any occurances in the past couple years...only thing that I've really done different was that I improved my overall diet (I'm getting older). The last event that I had, I truly thought that I was having a stroke or something. Most times single events last less than a second real time, but are hard to judge "feel-time", but the last one went on for more than that. Very scary. 




 Have you been officially diagnosed, or is this a self-diagnosis? And how often are these "attacks" happening to you?  




 Pooping boob-dicks? Meh. But thanks for the new screen name for my next throw away. 




 I love the Gipsy Kings. Turned on to them from their cover of Hotel California featured on the Big Lebowski soundtrack.
 




 Yoga pants. Oh, and long socks. Freakin' love em. 




 Is that really that bad? I take my boy out of school on occasion...sometimes for cool sciencey things like the (RIP) shuttle launches, sometimes just to spend some time together.

Then I saw that they were from Live Oak. If that means FL, then never mind, bunch o' inbred meat necks up there. 




 I would have sworn the answer was going to be "Potato!"

 If she's well-read, she'll know the book, and approve it for you. Tell her one of your parent's recommended it. 




 Alas, Babylon.

There was a movie made of it, but it's so obscure and terrible that I think you can dodge that one.

It's got adventure. It's a captivating read. And fascinating, when taken in the context of it being written in the 1950's. (1959)

I won't ruin much of it, but it was written during the height of the cold war. Nuclear exchange was starting to be a daily concern between the US and the USSR. The story basically concerns a group of survivors, and the run up to a thermonuclear weapon exchange between two superpowers. 

This book is technically classified as a YA (young adult) fiction, but I've read and re-read this book, and it stands up to be good at my (advanced) age.

Easy read for people that don't read recreationally, and for more intelligent people, it provides an insight into the fears that Americans were feeling during the cold war. Even if you don't do the report on it, pick it up and read it. It's good.

[Here's the Wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alas,_Babylon)

 Absolutely! My SO would love one, and love feedback! In fact, I'm a terrible musician, so I know feedback really well! No, really, I want to help...PM on the way. 




 BBQ sauce, sub maple syrup for some of the brown sugar.

Glaze smoked sausages on the grill. (Works for just about any meat. Maple glazed chicken breasts are freaky good!)

Sub for honey in just about any recipe. 




 It was a long wait, say true.
 




 Yeah, of course, but there is no support for that, just acknowledgment of the power of 19. 

The bigger issue for me is the rushed feeling of the ending...that nothing was fleshed out; like King woke up one morning and said to himself "OHHH! He'll just have to go through it again! I can finally end this thing!" 




 I hear you on Mordred: The whole last half of the final book felt rushed to me. It might be the way that I read the series. In order, as they were released. Yes, I waited the decade+ to find out what happened with Blaine.

King talks about how this story insisted itself, addressing it both in the fiction, and in many speaking engagements and TV shows he's done. You can almost tell that the end of the last book is done like yanking a splinter out: you've done all the work, got everything ready, and the only thing left is the one hard yank to get the fucker out. That's what the last book feels like to me.

More specifically, and I may be in the minority here, but I hated the ending. I get it, I get it, he had the horn the second time, there's a chance for redemption, but it doesn't address *why* he has the horn this time, how many times this has happened, and along with feeling rushed, it also feels like cheating. "Ka is a wheel, motherfuckers...HA!"
 




 LPT: Go to the hospital when you get salmonella. 




 At that point, I really didn't know that others existed...lol. Also, great course. Tom Brown park in Tallahassee. Look it up on dgcoursereview.com. Only a few pics up, but such a great place to play.
 




 I played just one course for about ten of those. Moved, found more courses. Adding two more this upcoming week when I go on vacation.

 Fifteen years, five different courses, no aces. I feel your pain.

The closest I ever came was the one and only time that I ever played by myself. At the very least my wife comes with me. Short hole, trees to the right, about 141 feet. Beautiful slight S curve and bumps the chains on the way by.

The only thing that I could think was that if I did ace it, who would I tell? There was no one there. Sure, my friends would believe me, but if a disc aces in the park and there's no one there to witness it, did it really *really* happen? 




 FOH restaurant manager here.

Get an order book and pen. Use them as props when talking to people and not ordering. (Also a great place to put crib notes about daily specials, drink ingredients, prices, etc.)

Never cross your arms or put your hands in your pocket. Never itch. Never touch your face. If the book thing doesn't work for you, cross your hands behind your back.

Got trouble with eye contact? Look at the end of their nose, or their eyebrows. More comfortable for you, barely noticable for them.

Read up on body language...much of what you do tableside is being picked up subconciously by your customers. Confident servers make more money. If you can't be confident, you must learn to fake confidence.

Take care of your hands. Make sure they are clean. Pay attention to your fingernails. Don't wear flashy jewelry, or clanky bracelets. If you have to have a band-aid on, make sure it stays clean, and is either very un-noticeable, or over the top goofy (like disney characters or camo or something) to make it a conversation piece.

Smile, unless your teeth are in bad shape. In that case, grin.

Be aware of your tone when talking to customers. Assume the role of butler. Always say "Yes" never say "Ya". Don't call a group of two women "guys". 

Act like you like your job. Leave the stress in the wait station or the kitchen.

Never talk about money (outside of item prices) with a customer. Never tell them how broke you are. And never ever talk about restaurant politics to a customer.

Have fun! 




 I love the [Where's George](http://www.wheresgeorge.com/) currency tracking project...but I sorta thought I was the only one leaving creative bill notes...:( 




 Try [votesmart.org](http://votesmart.org/), also check out [this site for current congressional votes](http://congress.org/congressorg/dbq/issuesdbq/votesearch.dbq) and [this site for current Senatorial votes](http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/a_three_sections_with_teasers/votes.htm).

The short answer is that it's not made easy for us to know what they are voting for...it's almost like they don't want us to know. Also, if you can find a special interest group that shares your beliefs and interests, visit their page often for info. Single issue sites like NORML.org for marijuana legislation, or Greenpeace for eco issues, etc. Also, I like to visit sites that I don't agree with, just to see what each side is watching or pushing. Lefty sides like moveon.org, and righty sites like The Heritage Foundation, at heritage.org. 




 Wow. Welcome to American politics.

First, don't believe anything that the candidates tell you. What they are doing this election cycle is nothing more than advertising, and it is just as false and misleading as product/service advertising is.

Second, there are way more than two candidates. Don't believe people when they say that when you vote for a third party candidate that you waste your vote; politicians only care about getting *your* vote (or the vote from the larger group of people that is representational of your beliefs/needs/goals/interests)...if they see that a third party candidate is getting some traction from the voters, they will find out why, craft a deliberately thought out opinion about those matters that drove people to that third candidate, and adopt those beliefs as there own as soon as possible.

Third. Do your research. See how the candidates have voted on issues in the past. Pay attention to how often the candidates change their core message for special interest groups. Google is your friend here...stay away from campaign sites and special interest sites, and try to follow the money whenever you can. Each candidate is deep in the pocket of somebody, try and find out who.

Fourth. Don't believe that any candidate wraps themselves in the ol' red white and blue because they are a patriot...most of them are in it for the money, or for the power, at least at the national level, and most of them owe favors to someone, or ones. When you vote for a candidate, you vote in the favors that he/she owes.

Fifth. Dig deeper. Go to your supervisor of elections site, and request a sample ballot. Each election you vote on many different issues. You may have local, state, or national judges to vote for. You may have local, state, or national laws to vote for. Don't get caught with your pants down. If you don't know about an issue, or a candidate, leave it blank...don't vote for the name you like, or the party you like, just beacuse you're uninformed. Best to leave it blank if you don't know.

Sixth. Go early on election day. Don't cause trouble, stand in line, be prepared to show ID, some states require multiple ID, understand what the rules are before you go. No protesting/stumping for candidates in the polling station. Be quiet, wait your turn, be a good citizen, get your sticker, and get the hell out of the way.

Seventh. It's important enough to say again. RESEARCH. Some can be done from sites you trust. If you go to r/politics, you're going to be bombared with Obamadramarama. If you go to conservative or xtian websites, you're going get the Romneyfication. 

MOST OF ALL...(all caps because this is really it) EVERYONE WHO TRIES TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE CANDIDATE IS PROBABLY MISINFORMED, AND BELIEVES THAT THEY PERSONALLY WILL BENEFIT FRON THEIR CANDIDATE BEING ELECTED. You should just keep that in mind.

Good luck, and your vote counts, particiapation is important, and the best advice that I would give you is to participate in your *local* elections...you have more access, the issues are smaller and easier to understand, and they hit you directly at home...small town politics are still alive and well in America, and not so corrupted with special interests and massive monetary donations, and you can actually talk to your candidates, look them in the eye, and ask them what are they going to do for you, to make your life better.

Do your best, and remember...this country was founded on people who didn't stick to the rules, decided to make their own, and if we hadn't have won our Revolutionary war, would have been considered terroists as opposed to heroes, and would have been put to death for treason.

tl;dr...I love my country, I just think that we should see other people. 




 ...aaaannnndd the corn lobby is fighting hard to get HFCS relabeled as "Corn Sugar". Soon after that you can guarantee that their argument will be "Corn sugar is just another natural sugar...you don't require nutrition labels to differeniate between beet sugars and cane sugars, why should corn sugars be any different?"

AND THEY WILL WIN. 




 I'm working on a gluten-free menu for the restaurant currently. Even the suppliers don't know what's in their products. It's a freakin' nightmare.
 




 Even that may be misleading. Products that contain *any amount* of real blueberries can lable their product "Made with real blueberries". What you won't realize is that by "blueberries" they literally mean that there were two blueberries in the entire batch, and the rest is colored and flavored gelatin or TVP, or some combination of the two. 




 Whilst smoking with some friends long ago, I had hit that point where I became part of the couch. I was too lazy to lean forward for the pass, so I stuck my shoe out to the dude handing it to me from a nearby chair. I had every intention of just bringing my foot closer to my hand, but apparently decided against it.

I flicked the toe of my shoe up, and that little smoky guy, about half way burned down, did a beautiful flip or forty-two through the air, and I just stuck out my hand, and caught it (just about) perfectly between my index and middle finger.

I was able to hit it, and then I enjoyed the stunned looks on my friends faces for a second or two before I completely lost it, running around the room, high-fiving, and exclaiming "DID YOU SEE THAT SHIT! ERMAGARD! THAT WAS SO FREAKIN' EPIC!!" 




 It's still hard to tell...the two biggest tells are the trumpet shape and the color. But the shape is shared by safflower...and the certification states that at some point someone went into that factory and saw what they thought was saffron...what's being produced there now could be a mix of true saffron and safflower, or something completely different. 




 Profit above all else...but most people don't see past the pictures on the front of the box. 

I've been working with the Anaphalaxis Network on getting together some alternative menus for our guests with food allergies, and the one thing that I've learned that stands out is that if you are trying to limit or eliminate one macroingredient from your diet, it's damn near impossible. Things are misleading, mislabled, recipes change and the packaging doesn't...these people don't care about their customers, they just care about dollars...just dollars. 




 I don't regularly work with saffron, but was exposed to it in culinary school...to be honest, I don't remember the taste, other than that it had one, and it was good. What I remember most is the way that the color steeped into warm water; slowly, like tea in slow motion, but with no agitation or stirring, just yellowyorangred slowly swirling out of that little fiber. It was pretty cool. 




 I'm sure that there is someway around it that makes what they do, if not legal, then not exactly illegal.

I work in the supervisory side of food service nowadays, but I have a fascination with all things food related, specifically labeling, nutrition, and general food safety. The amount of misinformation that is allowed when it comes to food and ingredient identification should be terrifying to anyone who cares about what they eat. 




 If you can't taste your saffron, it's probably safflower. I don't know much about Costco's brands, but much of what's on the market as saffron nowadays, isn't.

Check out [this article](http://www.couriermail.com.au/lifestyle/food-wine/cooks-see-red-over-fake-saffron/story-e6frer56-1225935122839) from two years ago about the influx of fake saffron into the industry. 




 Also, all of you who just read this, said "Nyan" in your best Japanese accent to find out if this works or not.

 Just tell him....most dudes love chicks that have fantastics about Haveing their butthold play/lick. 




 Step one: Insert penis somewhere tight, preferably moist.

Step two: Thrust.

Step three: Repeat as necessary.

Watch some porn, get some ideas, don't try anything to wacky, and let her take the lead if she will. Good luck, have fun. 




 Step one: Get a camera.

Step two: Take nakey nakey pics.

Step three: Post on r/gw

Step four: Include message..."I'll be glad to let you take more..."

Step five: Get over it, and enjoy the sweet sweet karma, and the attention from your bf. 




 ...and it was terrible. Except for Cap'n Lou Albano. He exuded awesome. 




 Quite a challenge if you don't want to spend money...lol. But a few pro tips from a Floridian that doesn't run his air very much.

Your house will be coolest in the morning. Capture that cool. Block windows with heavy drapes, keeps the sun out. Pay special attention to any windows that get direct sunlight. UV film or mirror film for your windows. If you have AC that's not working at optimum, check your filters, make sure your AC can breathe. To cool down one room, block the AC vents in other rooms by shutting them off, or sealing with plastic and duct tape. Block off any doors with hanging drapes as curtains. Invest in fans. Lots of them. If there is no breeze, don't open your windows. Maximize cross winds in your home. When wind is blowing from the east, open east and west facing windows. Long term, look into a window unit to assist your ailing AC until it can be repaired/replaced. 




 Who knew?
 




 I'm a self-appointed ambassador of disc golf in my little beach town; I tell anyone and everyone about the sport, and have got dozens of people involved in the sport. (Next goal, a local course!)

Some of the things that people say when I tell them that I play disc golf crack me up.

Had an older lady the other day ask me what the club looked like...

....the one we hit the "frisbee" with. 




 ....until I'm done with him. 




 Find a better guitarist. 




 Great idea, but I see how this could possibly backfire... 




 I love this man. Every thing he does just seems to ooze awesome. I wish he was coming closer to my home, but I'm calling the number, and letting him know that I will have booze and karaoke on the day that he's closest to me.

Though I do wonder if this is some sort of Bill prank? Gonna go around town laughing at all the people throwing parties with sheets out front of their house that say Bill Murry can crash here. 




 Looks interesting. We play Innova almost exclusively, just started checking out some of the other manufacturing companies. I've already got two kind disc golfers sending out discs for us, but I'll PM my addy for you, if you want to still send it...I'm no longer in dire need, though!  




 I've been furiously clicking away at the up button, but it will only let me orange it once. Trust us, we know how awesome he is...and hopefully we can find a way to reward him! 




 We actually looked at the Surge when we shopped for her Astra...only mistake that we made was the Astra at 171g was a little heavy for her, but she loved it. (More form than arm, you know.) I'll PM my address, if you can part with that Surge, and I don't think that she's thrown any of the other ones, but if you think that it would benefit a RHBH weak arm, send it on, and gracious appreciation will be yours! 




 In the spirit of the upcoming Arbitrary Day, I seek the help of my fellow Redditors and Discers. 

My wife and I took a couple of friends out to beautiful [Tuscawilla Disc Golf Course](http://www.dgcoursereview.com/course.php?id=98) to play a friendly round with a couple of our buddies.

You ever have that game where nothing really goes right? Or left? My wife had that game. And on the signature [hole #7](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=tuscawilla+disc+golf+hole+7 hl=en biw=1024 bih=616 tbm=isch tbnid=ZRm7d6vpuf3NeM: imgrefurl=http://discjag.blogspot.com/2009/07/tuscawilla-park-in-daytona-beach-fl.html docid=YgsrrwZ1FatbeM imgurl=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9MfYZehXfoI/SnIQEZEKecI/AAAAAAAAAOU/DNvOdVLAQXo/s400/tuscawilla_hole7_basket.jpg w=400 h=300 ei=Uz38T6aeFYWO8wSms-zcBg zoom=1 iact=hc vpx=282 vpy=114 dur=5281 hovh=194 hovw=259 tx=118 ty=117 sig=111693889434370404481 page=1 tbnh=131 tbnw=175 start=0 ndsp=15 ved=1t:429,r:6,s:0,i:91) my wife put not one, but both of her drivers in the lake. A rare pink pro Beast, and her favorite Millenium Astra.

This park will recover discs, I think, but it could be awhile, months even, before they turn up in the local seller's trailer. (She does have name and number on them.) This leaves my wife without drivers to play...and we play two to three times a week. 

So here's my problem...we're so broke lately we can't even pay attention...and I just don't know if I can free up the money to replace those discs. Maybe two weeks from now, I might be able to pick something up in a DX for her, but it will be a bit before I can get her some quality plastics again.

DG is such a great way for us to get out, and our kids love the time spent in the park, and it pains me to see my wife in such foul spirits after losing her two favorite discs, and not be able to do anything about it.

So here's my begging....if any of you have an extra driver laying around, something you're tired of seeing, or just a disc that you feel needs someone who will love it, learn with it, and try to keep it out of lakes, please PM me and let me know you can help.

I would be willing to reimburse shipping, but like I said before, we're way broke and it might be a minute, but I do pay my debts, or if you're interested in trade, my wife is quite the crafty one. (Here's some [bag tags](http://www.reddit.com/tb/vosw5) that we made for our little start up club.)....maybe we could work something out in trade? 

At the very least, thanks for taking the time to listen to the lament of amateurs who can't keep their discs out of the water...lol. (I've been in that lake a time or two as well, but on the edge...she sank **both** of them in the middle.)

Happy discing! 









 Yeah...joking about the pics, it seemed a reddit-y thing to say. 

Ceiling fan? Haven't tried that one...hmmm...plans for tonight have changed. 

I'm glad you're going to talk to her. My wife is a big fan of note writing, maybe that would be a good way to handle this touchy subject.

 




 You guys are close, go talk to her. Maybe she doesn't understand that not only is that gross and weird, but possibly unhealthy and dangerous.

You also said that she admired your toy, maybe she went out and bought the exact same one?

Either way, passive aggressive isn't going to work for this. Don't just lock it up or something, talk to her.

Oh, and pics, or it didn't happen? 




 It's a long running joke, because in a way, it's true.

But not inevitable. It comes from familiarity...and the male's desire to conquer as many different women as he can. (Show me the hottest chick on the planet, and I'll show you a dude who's tired of boning her.) There is no challenge, no chase, to having sex with the woman who shares your bed for ten years, twenty years, fifty years.

You can beat it, by staying creative, and making sure that you communicate about sex with your SO. The wife and I have been looking at each other's nakey nakeyness for over a decade, and she still turns me on...because she knows how to; because she knows me.

 




 The baby was fine, believe it or not, injured, but okay. I did hear that one old man passed away from injuries, but all the reports are still saying that no one died.

This was pretty big news in my part of FL. This happened about a half hour north from us, and just two weeks before, [Another Publix got hit by a small airplane](http://www.news-journalonline.com/news/local/west-volusia/2012/04/03/plane-hits-deland-publix.html), and that one is just a half hour west of us. Bad month for grocery stores. 




 That doesn't happen here in FL. The old zombies are all out driving around. I work in a touristy area of FL, really hip with the ancient wrinkly ones. In my town, the joke (it's only half a joke) is that you just don't take to the road around 7pm.

That's when happy hour ends, and the old drunk people drive back to their condos.

It's like a Nascar race in slow motion, but with more wrecks.

And people. And Publixes. Can't forget about the Publixes. 




 Not a waiting room...that's the entrance to a Publix supermarket in Palm Coast, FL.

We're known for our old ladies here in the FLA, and this was another one, who claimed that her accelerator "got stuck" and she couldn't stop as she plowed into the front doors of the joint.

Those people were hurt, but amazing enough, no one died.

 ....and Blingo was his name-o! 




 Answer 1: Learn how to come a lot, or become comfortable with other men involved.

Answer 2: My experience is that this is true. My SO and I don't keep score, but we break even. What's important is that it is fun and comfortable. Just make sure to show her how much you enjoy making her cum. 




 Well...that makes sense.  




 Awesome. Homemade and crafty stuff is the best!

And, just to note: pleasebemysanta, pleasebemysanta, pleasebemysanta, pleasebemysanta.. 




 What's black and blue, and doesn't like anal?



The nine year old in my trunk. 









 There are eight of us playing once a week at our local course. Two of us have lots of experience and know the game well, and the rest have just been introduced to the game and are at varying skill levels, from intermediate to noob. 

We want to introduce a little cash into the game. Here's where I need help. What sort of alternate games or scoring can we introduce to keep it fair for everyone?

We already have an ace fund (It's a short course, three holes less than 150') that rolls for the month. The first Thursday of the month we play a regular stroke game, with closest to pin taking the pot. Second Thursday, we play mixed draw doubles, winning team splits pot, and third Thursday we're thinking a handicapped tourney style. Help me out with one more type of disc golf game that doesn't favor the couple of exp players?

tl;dr I like words, don't judge me. 




 Is there a way that I can set a single cell, or range of cells, to multiply an entered value by x? I'm setting up an inventory sheet for a restaurant and I want to enter cases received, but need the number shown to represent a piece count.

Example: I receiced two cases of meat which contain 32 steaks each. I want the user to be able to enter the value "2" and return the value "64" to the same cell. 



















 Not looking for Me First and The Gimme Gimmes version, I need Whitney's. I keep finding [this tab](http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/w/whitney_houston/where_do_broken_hearts_go_tab.htm) on all my go-to tab sites, but I don't even know what that means! Help me, you guys! 
























 So explain to me like I'm five, web_design. I think I have a great idea for a magazine style website. I've done my research, and I believe that there are a group of people out there that are under-represented on the internet, and I want to fill that gap.

Here's the problem.

I'm an idiot.

Not really, but I have no experience in this field, and not many people to talk to. So, before I go out into the development/hosting community with money in my hand, ready to be fleeced, I thought maybe you guys could answer some questions for me? Please?

WEB DESIGN:

I would like this website to contain articles, which I post monthly, and then archive. I would also like this website to have user generated content, like uploaded pics and videos, with commenting available. So...

* As someone with no experience in website design, is an off the shelf product like Dreamweaver or similar even something that I want to mess with?
* If not, what should I be looking for from my web designer? Is this something that an amateur could do, or am I heading for one of the bigger design firms?
* About what price range should I be expecting to pay for a design service?


WEB HOSTING:

I don't know much about this topic, and have got Google overload from trying to differentiate between all the companies out there. Obviously I want a host that is gonna give me good uptime, and they all claim to have great uptime. So...

* What's the difference from paying 9$ for one company and 23$ for another?
* When talking to the hosting company, is the website that I described above considered one site with many pages, or many sites?
* What about combo packages? I've seen several of the "brand name" companies offering design and hosting at one price? Good idea, or waste of time built specifically for suckers like me?
* Is hosting something that I should be looking for from my designer?

WEBSITE MAINTENANCE:

I want to be able to post articles on a regular basis. Probably four sections, each updated monthly. I want to allow user uploaded content and comments. Again assuming that I don't know anything about how a website works...

* Are things like posting articles, allowing uploaded content, removing comments/uploaded content, etc...something that I should fully expect to be able to do on my own, or is this something that I will have to have help in, either from my designer or host?
* What sort of other maintenance should I be expecting to do? 


ADVERTISING/REVENUE:

Sure, we all want to make money right? I'd like to have a little revenue coming in. 

* This website would be target-specific, so would something generic like Google Adsense work for this idea, or should I be contacting specific webmasters about advertising opportunities? 
* Would like to have the ability to sell items related to the website on the site (not the main focus of the project)...cart it up on the page, or link out to some Etsy or Ebay page?
* I understand that adding advertising on your site is just cutting and pasting code into your existing page...is this something that I can learn? How quickly, or how difficult for someone with little/no exp? Or is this something I have to have someone else do for me everytime I want to change ads on the site?

One more question about website registration...the name that I want is currently registered with GoDaddy, and not used. Expires in about six months. What happens after that expiration date? Is it open season on the domain name, and I can register it through my choice of domain registrys, or do I have to deal with the GoDaddy folks to try and capture that domain name?


You guys are awesome for even reading this far. I've gotten great help from Reddit in the past for all kinds of other issues, and I have no doubt that someone or ones out there can help me out a little bit. Ease my Google headache a little bit, and let me go into this sounding like I know what the hell I'm talking about.
 




 Because my original santa didn't send anything by the deadline or attempt to message me about sending it late, I was rematched. Right away I received several messages from my rematch santa, and soon after that my gift was marked as shipped. However, the same day my rematch shipped my gift, I received another gift by UPS. It was from Amazon and included a gift note saying *Merry Christmas from Reddit Secret Santa.* 

Now, I have confirmed with my rematch santa that these gifts are not from him, and the name on the gift note does not match my original santa's name (as confirmed by kickme444 through private messages). Also, my original santa hasn't marked anything as being shipped.

Santa, if you could come forward and reveal yourself that would sure help me out. I want to confirm this gift as received, however, if it isn't from my original santa, I don't want him/her getting credit for sending a gift they did not send. If it is from them, I don't want them getting banned for not sending a gift. 

It is a really great gift, and I want the sender to know that it is GREATLY appreciated! Please come forward, Santa. You can even message me privately if you want. Thanks!

 




 I learned this song in 04, and I don't remember it in D...does anybody know any different?
 














 My buddy and I are getting together a very casual acoustic duo. In addition to several originals, we're trying to get together some good two part guitar, two part vocal songs...and we just can't think of very many to check out. So, wanna help us out? We're both dudes, with a strong mid-range vocal, and decent alto vocal. Guitar skill is medium and advanced, respectively. We're willing to check anything out, and comments with youtube or tab links will be upprecciated! 









 In response to this [video post](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/lubn3/cockroach_in_your_ear_nsfl/), I responded with this:


This actually happened to me.

I was staying at a friends house, and woke up with an absolutely horrible *scrabbling* sensation in my ear. I don't remember too much about the next couple of minutes, but my friend tells me that she heard me fumbling about in the bathroom, and came in to find me standing at the sink, amongst a scattering of used qtips, a spilled bottle of hydrogen peroxide, and holding a pair of scissors.

I don't really know what I was going to do with the scissors.

The roach, a little german guy, had climbed down (or had been forced down by my mishandled ministrations) well into my ear canal, and had run into my ear drum.

I wish I could explain what that sounds like. I have been telling this story for over a decade, and I've never been able to accurately explain how *alien*; how perfectly horrible that sound is.

And it was loud.

The bug would be still for a period of time, and then would start moving, and I would fall to the ground, truly writhing on the ground.

The girl lived close to the hospital, and we walked up to the emergency room. It was about 3am at this point, and we had to go to this walk-up window, and explain what was happening before they would let us in.

As I was explaining what had happened to me, that little fucker started doing his laderhosen dance on my eardrum, and I fell to my knees at the window, cracking my chin a good one on the counter on the way down.

When I got back to my feet, the receptionist lady asked me (not kidding)...."Is it really *bugging* you that bad?"

When I find her, I will kill her.

After getting into the ER, the doc came in, and took a look in my ear with the scope thingy. He explained that they were going to have to remove it manually, with forceps.

It took two orderlies and a security guard to hold me down.

The doc stretched my earhole out with some sort of spreader, (that hurt a lot) and went in after the bug. The bug saw him coming, and didn't want anything to do with the shiny metal things coming after it, and tried to go the other way...

**Into my brain.**

The doc finally got hold of the bug, and there was this feeling of *pulling*, and the sound...this horrible *stretching* sound, though that really doesn't do it justice, as the bug fought to remain in the nice new warm home that it had found.

The doc removed the bug from my ear...

*In pieces.*

He didn't want out. At all.

Long story short (too late?), a fairly serious infection that required me to spend a bit of time in the hospital, some minor damage to my ear drum and ear canal, some long term hearing loss...I still am not at 100% in that ear, 90% maybe, but not perfect...and a whole lot of alcoholic counseling over the next couple of years to get over the whole event.

Perfect story for halloween, and every word true. I slept with earplugs for quite a few years afterward...I eventually got over it; no paranoia about bugs, though I don't like to talk about it, and haven't thought of it in years.

Thought reddit might be interested in my story; ask away.


 














 Not a lot like [Crichton's other work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton#Works), other than the fact that the book was well researched and well written, [Pirate Latitudes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Latitudes) was discovered after Crichton's death. Wanna talk about this book? 










































































 It has come to our attention that the usage of *"Cutting the cheese"* as a euphemism for passing gas has declined sharply since the mid '80's. We are now involved in a program to have this phrase revitalized in the American lexicon. To aid in this effort, we have now declared that *"Gutting the fish"* will now be used as a lexicon for the vaginal queef.

Just please note that the following phrases are *still* acceptable when referring to the vaginal queef. (This list is **not** meant to be all-inclusive.)

* Panty Blaster
* Blowfish
* Vart, Varting
* Bi-labial fricative 
* Victoria's Secret

 I responded by saying that I was gonna call mine "Inception" because it leaves you confused, and glad that it's over. 





























 It seems to me from reading all these great posts in this sub, that us CC's essentially fall into two categories...

* Those of us that are tired of the cable monopolies, and are working to find a way to watch televised entertainment on our own terms, and...

* Those of us who have recognized that TV watching is an addiction, and have used cordcutting to control this aspect of our lives.

Where do you fall, and do we deserve two different classifications of cordcutter?

 This law was tested in front of the [Supreme Court](http://supreme.justia.com/us/377/402/case.html) in June of 1964, and found to be unconstitutional. 

This law was passed shortly after the [Monkey Trial](http://law.jrank.org/pages/2855/John-Thomas-Scopes-Trial-1925-Monkey-Trial-Darrow-Deflates-Bryan.html) where evolutionism was attacked. John Scopes was found to be guilty of violations of [The Butler Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Act), though John Scopes was not fined, and the courts eventually moved to find the Butler Act unconstitutional in 1967.  




 When my Grandmother died, she willed her property to me. My father was supposed to help out by monitoring the taxes on the land, and basically screwed us by not paying any of it.

Here's the quandry I'm having. My mother in law (a paralegal and "flipper") did some legwork and tells me the property is valued at $9600. (It's 2.4 acres in an undeveloped part of Northern Florida. It has a house on it, but the house is in serious disrepair.) She tells me that the total tax burden is $5400, and that if not paid by the end of the month, it will go to auction.

She offered me this deal. She would write the check for $5400 if I would put her on the deed. When I paid off the loan, she would switch the deed back to my name. Sounded a bit shady to me, and I know she's done some shady things, but she's never done me wrong.

I asked my wife to confirm these things for me, and she got on the horn with the tax office, and is told that we must make a payment of only $655 to pay off the back property taxes (Not paid since 2002) to prevent auction. She was also told that the total value of the property was $14500. The rest of the $5400 is "special assessment taxes" for 911 and such, that haven't ever been paid on the property, but that could be paid in installments.

My questions are...

Is my MIL trying to screw me? I don't know why she would lie to me...

Am I in danger of having the tax certs sold on that property if I don't pay the total tax burden of $5400?

Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

Edits: formatting

Edit: **UPDATE**  The MIL was not trying to help us, she was trying to screw us, I guess. We told her about the $655 being the only thing that I need to pay to keep the property, and she's been freaking out...cajoling us, yelling, harassing phone calls, and screaming fights, telling us the only way is her way, even in the face of contradictory evidence. The only question now is what can I do to get the money together by the end of the month...I've got about half of it, and I'm rolling nickels to try and get the rest of it together! Wish me luck. 



















 Let's discuss. Is this a good day in history that provided closure for the Vietnam era, or was this a cowardly move to forgive men not strong enough to fight?

 I was unlucky enough to have to drive 95 north to 10 west in florida on Sunday, the day after all the bowl games here in the great state of Florida, and while driving, a couple of things occured to me.

If you have those really cool blue headlights, you are an asshole. Yes everyone can see you coming, but that's all they can see. You are blinding everyone else.
High beams are for deserted country roads with no streetlights. Just because it gets a little misty in the evening in the Florida winter, doesn't mean you have to light the way like Jeebus himself.
The left lane is known as the fast lane or hammer lane or passing lane for a reason. If you are in that lane, and people are passing you on the left, you are in the wrong fucking lane. Get over.
If you approach a group of cars that are evenly spaced out, traveling safely, with the faster cars on the left, this is not an invitation for you to fulfill your nascar fantasies by zipping in and out of traffic. Slow the hell down, and join the flow.
When it rains, slow the hell down. Especially if you are sporting crappy tires in an old beater. I'm talking to you SUV I saw fishtailing its way towards (what I thought would be) certain death, around exit 303 on I10
Try to remember that your car is several thousand pounds of steel, while you (and myself and my family) are just simply several pounds of meat. Safety has come a long way, but meat will still lose to steel at high speeds.
And just a note to the SUV with GA tags, and all the Jeebus stickers. The way you were driving on 95 north made me think that you hoped Jeebus would see you safely to your destination. Whipping in and out of lanes, no blinkers; talking on the cellophone, kids in the back. I wished you good luck as you shot by, but I have to tell you, when I saw your SUV had gone off the shoulder and rolled, and all your possessions had been strewn across the highway for the world to see, I could not help but laugh my way to my destination. I was glad to see that you and your family were apparently unhurt, so maybe Jeebus was looking out for your car, but Karma was looking out for the rest of us.

Drive safe, redditors. Wherever you're going, don't be dying to get there.

 Let's get to work on this, reddit. 




 Instead I found [this](http://www.brunching.com/alanislyrics.html) and [this](http://www.song-lyrics-generator.org.uk/). 




 Cmon locals...who's going to the St auggie or NSB Beachside show? Any one going to Bear Creek this year? 




 Get a [taste](http://www.zachdeputy.com/) here if you are not yet familiar with his island-infused, drum n bass, gospel ninja soul music! See you there! 




 
So, I'm taking the kids down to the local library today, and while we're there, the wife and I are going to cast our votes for the midterm election. As an American citizen, this is a favorite day of mine...but this year, as a Florida resident, I have been subjected to the very worst that bipartisan politics has to offer. This has been the longest run up to an election that I think I've ever had to suffer, and I haven't seen mud slung like this since the last time I saw the girls wrestling at Bottom's Up. I know nothing about the candidates, other than the fact that if they were put in the same room, Tina Turner would magically appear, and people would start chanting "Two man enter, one man leaves!"

 

For the spot of governor this year we have a democrap and a republicliar. I don't know anything positive about either (R) Rick Scott or (D) Alex Sink. But I have heard that (D) Sink has had unprocteced gay sex with her unborn fetus before going and having it aborted by an illegal alien that she promised amnesty to. And I heard that (R) Scott was all for invading Mexico instead of putting up a wall, and all he needed to know about government he learned from the bible and 1984 by George Orwell. There were also some other people running who don't have enough money to be important.

 

The Senate race is not much better. The Derpocrats are offering us Kendrick "Aren't we progressive by nominating a black guy" Meek, and the Retardicans are offering us Marco "Cuba wasn't that bad" Rubio. These two have been overshadowed by the fight for Governator. After all the money that they spent, and all the ads that they both have run, the only thing that I know about these two with any certainty, is what they look like. They are as insubstantial as ghosts, only louder. Then you got Independent Charlie "Jesus H." Crist. This guy has been accused of flip flopping more than John Kerry ever was. Crist was a party Retardican, until the party line required him to set fire to the Gulf of Mexico so that rich fat white men could squeeze a little more blood out of the citizen turnips that they "represent" (They keep saying this word, but I do not think it means what they think it means...) Crist broke the party line, the Party pulled support, so Crist dumped the party so that he could represent the People's Will of Florida....and this apparently is a bad thing. Having morals will not be rewarded, there Charlie. There are also some othere people who did not have enough money to matter.

 

There are a few amendments to vote on, but none of them are Prop 19, so no one has seemed interested in them. In Florida we have amendments 5   6, which supposedly are supposed to bring some common sense law to congressional redistricting. The Democrat commercials that I've seen on this seem to explain what the amendment purports to do, and how it will affect Floridians. The Republican commercials that I've seen about this simply point out that the ACLU is run by the devil, and shows pictures of Obama and Pelosi, with their heads bent together, apparently continuing to plot for world domination.

 

And my other favorite...A non-binding referundum. I qoute:

"In order to to stop the uncontrolled growth of our National Debt and prevent excessive borrowing by the Federal Government, which threatens our economy and national security, should the United States Constitution be amended to require a balanced budget without raising taxes?"

 

Wow. Sounds good. Our family runs a balanced budget, so the government ought to be able to as well, right? But I also spend a lot of time and energy increasing the amount of income that I recieve. You do know how the government gets its income right? Taxes! I'm all for a smaller government, and I don't think that we need to be paying for illegal aliens to get health care, and for the state of Missouri to do a multi million dollar study to find out why crisp pickles are better than soggy ones, but I don't think that we need to have a constitutional amendment that prevents our government from recieving additional income. (I'm a fan of the fair tax, but no one's letting my vote on that, yet) I know that it's possible to have a balanced budget without borrowing (Clinton did it) but this feels like the same thing that is wrong with america at large. We want what we want, but no one wants to pay for it.

 


Ending on an important note...please get up and turn off your TV, do the research on-line about the candidates that you care about, and learn about the issues you get to vote on, and go on down to your polling place and cast your vote. Please. It's your job. It's your duty. And many Americans in the past had to die to get you that right. White folks had to fight in the beginning for their right to vote, and then change the law so that they didn't have to own property to be able to vote. You black folks couldn't vote until 1870, and in most parts of the country they made it so difficult for you that most of you couldn't vote until the Civil Rights era of the '60s and '70s. And you girlys out there...do you remember when you learned about the suffergettes? You've only been voting since 1920. Don't do your ancestors a disservice by forgetting the lessons that they paid so dearly for. See you in line, I'm gonna go vote. Whether it's for a douchebag or a shit sandwich is yet to be determined.

So, I'm taking the kids down to the local library today, and while we're there, the wife and I are going to cast our votes for the midterm election. As an American citizen, this is a favorite day of mine...but this year, as a Florida resident, I have been subjected to the very worst that bipartisan politics has to offer. This has been the longest run up to an election that I think I've ever had to suffer, and I haven't seen mud slung like this since the last time I saw the girls wrestling at Bottom's Up. I know nothing about the candidates, other than the fact that if they were put in the same room, Tina Turner would magically appear, and people would start chanting "Two man enter, one man leaves!"

 

For the spot of governor this year we have a democrap and a republicliar. I don't know anything positive about either (R) Rick Scott or (D) Alex Sink. But I have heard that (D) Sink has had unprocteced gay sex with her unborn fetus before going and having it aborted by an illegal alien that she promised amnesty to. And I heard that (R) Scott was all for invading Mexico instead of putting up a wall, and all he needed to know about government he learned from the bible and 1984 by George Orwell. There were also some other people running who don't have enough money to be important.

 

The Senate race is not much better. The Derpocrats are offering us Kendrick "Aren't we progressive by nominating a black guy" Meek, and the Retardicans are offering us Marco "Cuba wasn't that bad" Rubio. These two have been overshadowed by the fight for Governator. After all the money that they spent, and all the ads that they both have run, the only thing that I know about these two with any certainty, is what they look like. They are as insubstantial as ghosts, only louder. Then you got Independent Charlie "Jesus H." Crist. This guy has been accused of flip flopping more than John Kerry ever was. Crist was a party Retardican, until the party line required him to set fire to the Gulf of Mexico so that rich fat white men could squeeze a little more blood out of the citizen turnips that they "represent" (They keep saying this word, but I do not think it means what they think it means...) Crist broke the party line, the Party pulled support, so Crist dumped the party so that he could represent the People's Will of Florida....and this apparently is a bad thing. Having morals will not be rewarded, there Charlie. There are also some othere people who did not have enough money to matter.

 

There are a few amendments to vote on, but none of them are Prop 19, so no one has seemed interested in them. In Florida we have amendments 5   6, which supposedly are supposed to bring some common sense law to congressional redistricting. The Democrat commercials that I've seen on this seem to explain what the amendment purports to do, and how it will affect Floridians. The Republican commercials that I've seen about this simply point out that the ACLU is run by the devil, and shows pictures of Obama and Pelosi, with their heads bent together, apparently continuing to plot for world domination.

 

And my other favorite...A non-binding referundum. I qoute:

"In order to to stop the uncontrolled growth of our National Debt and prevent excessive borrowing by the Federal Government, which threatens our economy and national security, should the United States Constitution be amended to require a balanced budget without raising taxes?"

 

Wow. Sounds good. Our family runs a balanced budget, so the government ought to be able to as well, right? But I also spend a lot of time and energy increasing the amount of income that I recieve. You do know how the government gets its income right? Taxes! I'm all for a smaller government, and I don't think that we need to be paying for illegal aliens to get health care, and for the state of Missouri to do a multi million dollar study to find out why crisp pickles are better than soggy ones, but I don't think that we need to have a constitutional amendment that prevents our government from recieving additional income. (I'm a fan of the fair tax, but no one's letting my vote on that, yet) I know that it's possible to have a balanced budget without borrowing (Clinton did it) but this feels like the same thing that is wrong with america at large. We want what we want, but no one wants to pay for it.

 


Ending on an important note...please get up and turn off your TV, do the research on-line about the candidates that you care about, and learn about the issues you get to vote on, and go on down to your polling place and cast your vote. Please. It's your job. It's your duty. And many Americans in the past had to die to get you that right. White folks had to fight in the beginning for their right to vote, and then change the law so that they didn't have to own property to be able to vote. You black folks couldn't vote until 1870, and in most parts of the country they made it so difficult for you that most of you couldn't vote until the Civil Rights era of the '60s and '70s. And you girlys out there...do you remember when you learned about the suffergettes? You've only been voting since 1920. Don't do your ancestors a disservice by forgetting the lessons that they paid so dearly for. See you in line, I'm gonna go vote. Whether it's for a douchebag or a shit sandwich is yet to be determined.

 I know there are locals in this tourist heavy town. Let's not be overshadowed by r/orlando anymore! 









 I am contemplating leaving my steady job with the goal of total entertainment domination of the area in which I live. Karaoke, event DJ, live sound production/recording, and gigging as a one man band...any tips or warnings from those of you making a living in the industry? 









 Condensation will collect on a surface when it is colder than the air around it, correct? Trying to build a small(ish) collector with an output of around 1/2 oz per hour. Could I use a metal bowl shape to heat up a volume of air using solar heat so that condensation would collect on a small metal plate that is shaded by the bowl? Any ideas/help?  




 I'll post for a bit tonight, and then tomorrow afternoon when I come out of my anesthetic fog... 




 I've had this broke-ass tooth for six years, and I'm finally manning up and getting it taken care of. I'll answer questions about my monday-morning-molar-meltdown tonight, and then Monday afternoon when I am able to. 














 [Here's](http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2010/07/28/a-poignant-way-to-mark-911/) the story from The Independent. 

The Dove World Outreach Center? Really? What sort of outreach is this? 

Here's the [facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Burn-A-Koran-Day/134718123226530?v=wall) of this wonderful event. My wife and I were thinking about going....anyone know where we can get a whole lot of bibles for really cheap? (Any other FL Redditors thinking about going?)

If you don't go, you could still drop a comment at the anti quran burning [facebook page here](http://www.facebook.com/pages/In-Protest-of-International-Burn-a-Koran-Day/105895039464821?ref=ts)

See ya there! 









 Happy 100, [Jacques Cousteau!](http://www.cousteau.org/) Anyone want to guess what Jacques would have had to say about our Gulf of Mexico? 









 Heard he had a different stroke. 




 Or do I need a new hobby?

[Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/smokin-joe-ledden/tracks) 




 I reworked this recording today. It's an [old song](http://soundcloud.com/smokin-joe-ledden/circles), but I like the vocals. 
 




 My wife and I have a very good mexican friend who lives a few hours away (in the US). We don't get to see or talk to them often. When we decided that we were getting married, we called him and told him that we needed an address to send him an invitation. His response was that he was "not aware that he needed one" and then contact has broken off. Have my wife and I mistakenly broken some sort of taboo? Never had any issue like this with him before, and he didn't come to the wedding, invitation or not. 

Can you help? And, if we have done something taboo, how do we apologize?

(edit:grammar) 




 I record in Cubase3...have no problem converting cubase's .cpr files into .wav files. Can't find a converter to take .wav into .mp3 without adding pop/clicks or just generally sounding like hell...any ideas? 









 Where are some good sites for hosting/posting music? How do I get people listening from here. I have only a small library of original music right now, but I am recording often, and I don't know what to do with all my hard work. Any suggestions?

 1. Good advice, as 1 out of every 50 eggs will be ...weird. Extra yolk, fertilized, or just generally gross. I break them singly into a plastic egg cup before I toss it in the pan/baking mix.

2. If you're having this big of a problem with egg shell, you're cracking your eggs too hard. Just tap them on the side with the back end of a knife, use both hands (pro level one handed!) to pull the shells apart...usually no fragments. 




 Excellent suggestions! Thanks so much. I definitely use outside storage, though that fried in my electrical explosion event too. This think looks lag free and powerful! Thanks again! 




 Over time,  I have learned to like the ending, but upon first read, it just pissed me off...it felt cheap, too easy...re-reading and reading again, and I feel a little bit better for it, but when I read those words, those oh so familiar words, after all this time....*sigh. 




 Most of my recording paths are "live" (for lack of a better description), basically an outboard sound source - outboard preamp - outboard effects - into the DAW. What plugins and VSTs that I do use are instrument modelers for my MIDI controller...and not big combo packs (like Komplete programs with over 250 instruments emulators, I look for downloads of single sounds, or just a few options for a single sound, depending on my needs... I know you need me to be more specific, but the reason that I'm attempting this build is that I had a major electrical fuckaroo caused by an act of drunk people driving into power pole...fried my studio, and most everything connected to it....including a very high end APC surge protector...with the insurance nightmare, it's been months (almost a year) since I've been able to use the studio, so it's difficult to remember all the VSTs and plugins that I have used in the past.) I will say again that VSTs and plugins are minor compared to the "live" aspect of my recording. (I know that Cubase is built for beatmasters and electronica, but it has features that work for me as a live recorder.)

As far as tracks, most songs would have five or six stereo tracks (the way I record/mix that means 10-12 single tracks) effects tracks for each of those, and maybe 3-5 digital/midi tracks, with effects tracks for each of those...so 35 tracks max, and that would be a very "busy" piece for me.

The only other pertinent thing I would add is I would like to have the ability to use a dual monitor system...my last studio did not, but I think that would make my life a little easier; having both the ability to split screens so that the DAW is on one screen, and effects/emulators/MIDI can run on the other, and to mirror, so when I'm working with other musicians we can both see the same DAW while working in different area of my studio corner. (And, I'm not much for overclocking or anything, my DAC provides external clocking anyway, pretty sure.)

Sorry so wordy, and I appreciate whatever advice is coming my way! 




 None. Digital Audio converter will run on USB 2.0. Mic/instrument/midi will run through DA converter. 




 Read on. You will be given an opportunity to stop early. Many of us wish we had. But you won't. And King will call you out for your decision... "You are the grim, goal-oriented ones who will not believe the joy is the journey rather than the destination...who still get the lovemaking confused with the paltry squirt that comes to end the lovemaking." You will read to the end, oh yes, and you will see...yes, you will see. You will finally see.

The next time you read it, stop there. It's better that way. 




 I would like to, but my previous PC did not...latency was noticeable in some heavy application sound paths.  




 I need to replace my digital audio workstation! Thinking about a combo machine that I could also use for general video editing (no software chosen, youtube quality stuff) and photoshop applications. DAW running Cubase 5, (maybe upgrading) along with several other virtual sound editors/effects/modulators/emulators. Lag is a killer in sound recording, of course, so let's avoid that. Budget on the low end, let's try to keep it under a grand? I can source OS and peripherals elsewhere.  




 Self-explanatory.
 




 I tried everything...the only thing that worked for me was patience, and trying to be understanding and not filled with self hate when I failed, which I did, over and over and over and over again. But each time I failed, I would let them grow a little bit farther. I still don't know if I've succeeded, I just haven't bit my nails in quite a while, I may still bite them in the future. But if I do, I'll move on, start over, and be patient. I will win. 




 Same problem here. I just quit biting my nails recently, (three year process, not biting for months now) and it seems to have gotten worse. Inside of my cheeks are beat to hell. 




 That was badass. I think the commentators will be washing their underwear and extra time or two...they really seemed to enjoy that. 




 Lick your lips, moan, look him deeply in the eyes, grunt and say..

"I'm gonna be pickin' your ball hair outta my teeth for *days*!"

Try to be sexy when you do, it helps.
 




 I do it all the time.

I'm up to one orgasm. Then I take a nap for 56 minutes.
 




 Didn't really get that either. I thought perhaps she's mad at the way Glen's been acting about the whole thing, but if she was mad about Glen being super mad, why get super mad at Glen?

Still don't understand women, even when fictionalized. *sigh. 




 Two methods here. As mentioned, the menu puts profit above all else...the items that are described the best, or boxed out, or "featured" or some such, are the items that the restaurant makes the most profit on. These are not necessarily the best items, just the ones that make the most money. Quick menu rule of thumb...if you want good food, order what the restaurant specializes in. Eating in a steakhouse, order steak. Pizza joint? Stay away from the sandwiches. Don't order chicken at a seafood joint. Other method is to chat up your server. They may suggest items with a high markup to try and pad their tip, but engage them, and ask them what do they eat when they get off work. Tip accordingly for awesome suggestions. 




 Lucifer's Hammer - Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle (sp?)... the book that turned me on to reading oh so long ago. Great epic end of the world shit right here man. 




 This is a good idea. There is a disconnect in expectations as most men are waiting to meet their insatiable whore while most women are waiting to meet their Prince Charming...or, women need to watch more porn, and men need to watch more Disney.

Or Disney Porn. Just sayin'. 




 One time my future wife and I were hanging out with some friends at our local bar. I was yuckin' it up, being the life of the party (my thing) and the future wifey-poo says something-or-other while I was talking to some friends, so I face-palmed her, and (loudly) said...

 "SHUUUUSH! Grownups talking!

We are still together, married for three years, believe it or not, though she does tell me (too often) that that was the closest she's ever been to slapping the dogshit outta me. Even though I got a great laugh out of that line, in the end, not worth it, wouldn't recommend it...

 




 "Oh, you were *in* the Holocaust? Well at least you weren't raped in the Holocaust." 




 130 pounds of prime rib, about 45 filets of tenderloin, a couple of porterhouse steaks, about 50 top sirloin steaks, about 30 ribeyes, 250 baked potatoes, four pounds of creamed spinach, about two gallons of rice, 20 filets of salmon, 20 filets of swordfish, two pounds of shrimp, 40 racks of babyback ribs, and 40 chicken breasts. (I had to work, had leftover ribs with the wife when I got home around midnight. Happy Valentine's Day!) 




 I call mine the Rubik's Cube....because it gets harder the more you play with it. 




 So much of our reality is based on that fiction. 




 A smile.


Seriously. Whether it's sexy short skirts, or a long skirt and no undies, or sweat pants and tank top like Panda said, the most important thing is confidence and fun.

For me, just the smile, when we get home, please. I don't need anything else. 




 Lol....true, it has been said that you can turn to any random page of the bible and find relevance. The bible is full of death, so really no surprise that that is mentioned often, but it was neat to see how many chapter 2, verses 17 had something in common. (I researched chapters 21 verses 7 and didn't see as many commonalities.) Just a statistical blip, but it was fun researching it. (An atheist's best weapon is biblical knowledge, you know!) 




 Hmmm....

So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. Ecclesiastes 2:17

The LORD has done what he planned; he has fulfilled his word, which he decreed long ago. He has overthrown you without pity, he has let the enemy gloat over you, he has exalted the horn of your foes. Lamentations 2:17

Let the priests, who minister before the LORD, weep between the temple porch and the altar. Let them say, "Spare your people, O LORD. Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn, a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the peoples, 'Where is their God?' "  Joel 2:17

The arrogance of man will be brought low and the pride of men humbled; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day,  Isaiah 2:17

Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether. Song of Solomon 2:17

And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams  Acts 2:17

Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. James 2 2:17

And the world and its desires are fading away, but the person who does God's will remains forever. John 2:17

but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die. Genesis 2:17

Very interesting. I wonder if this was intended or mere happenstance. A lot of these verses sort of...*fit*.
 




 I saw it...curiouser and curiouser... 




 You spelled "Idiots" wrong. 




 Good read, opinion adjusted, but, reading the report, I feel like the main thing I learned is that here is another example of a complex economic system being described two very different ways. The ROI of 7:1 (I wasn't familiar with the 22:1, that seems high!) and 1:10 shows the difference between NASA *contributing* to new ideas, and the *direct* effect of creating businesses or patentable new items that result in private sector profit. (I admit to being biased in favor of NASA, I live right down the road from America's Spaceport, and there's nothing like watching a launch light up the night sky over the Atlantic!) 




 We needed NASA to get us off the planet. And they did so. But only with the entire nation behind the endeavour, fueled by the Cold War scare. Now that we have been there, national interest is far lower, and the return on investment is perceived to be low, though the opposite has been proven, even showing that compared to other monies spent on government program, NASA has the best ROI than any other program in history. But, short of some international boogeyman threatening to take the moon from us, the future is going to be about money. NASA is more about science, and I think that they will continue that mission in the future, but the next space race is already on, and it's a race for revenue. Whether it will be from mining asteroids, or lunar tourism, or orbiting solar power generation stations, or even asteriod based robotic manufacturing plants, private companies will lead the way in further exploration as they try to find the money hidden in space. Overall, I feel like this is a good thing, private companies taking the risks, and reaping the rewards will mean that many private citizens in the near future will have access to space. This will lead to colonization, whether orbital, lunar, or other, and once humans are living in space, there will be more opportunites for people in support positions for those working in space based industry. (Those folks gotta eat, somebody will get up there and figure out how to open a restaurant, though I think a bar would probably be first!) 




 I think the media is being careful...there's a strong chance that this guy could end up looking a bit like a hero. Read the "manifesto" and ignore the second half, and it's like a Hollywood movie where the good guy is identified as the bad guy by the bad guys that wear the uniforms of the good guys.

Also, the MSM doens't go out of it's way to report on cops looking bad at their jobs, and so far Dormer is making the LAPD look like a bunch of boy scouts. Watch, when they catch (and kill, most likely) this guy, this story will suddenly get a whole lot of coverage. 




 Sure, sure, sure, let's all sit down and have a rational conversation, but ask yourself, *is it funny?* (Note: I don't think the situation is funny, really it's just a bit disturbing, and probably would be best handled in some other fashion than mine, but if they choose to take my advice I feel I should add that they put a camera in the box as well, you know, *for the funny!* 




 If I had a penchant for stealing panties from my female friends and GFs of my male friends, and got a box full of panties, and *then* uncovered pictures of my male friends and BFs of my female friends wearing those panties, it would certainly make me think twice about repeating that behavior! Letters not necessary, I suppose, but a bonus, as OP stated that he wanted to preserve the friendship. 




 Tough question. Here's why. 

Sound: Everybody likes a different sound. And everybody plays a different style. Fingerstyle pickers want a real bright sound. Chorders want something that's going to ring out a bit. Compound that with the fact that the strings that I like on my acoustic are gonna sound different on yours.

Size: The gauge of the string is important as well. Real thin sets (from .007 or .008) are for real light players or softer sounds, heavier sets for the big strummers. Gauge of the sting will affect brightness to a small degree, with heavier strings, generally, being brighter.

Metal: Lots of different types of metal besides steel. Steel nickel wound. Brass/phosphorous. Hell, you can buy strings with a gold coat if you want. Different types of metals will give you different types of sounds and finger feel.

Price: Cheapo strings are usually just that, but expensive doesn't mean good.

Life: If you're touring, and changing sets every four days, then the life of your strings really doesn't matter. But if you're like the other 99.9% of us, you're probably on a budget, and want those strings to last a bit. Each company's strings are a little different here, and unfortunately the only way to compare is to buy them.
 
So, for me, I choose Martin Marquis 80/20 Phosphor/Bronze with the unwound Gstring, med gauge. (.009). Because, I like the way it feels on my fingers, I prefer a med-heavy gauge, because sometimes I like to get funky on my acoustic. I like the life of my Martin Marquis, I like C.F. Martin in general (my box isn't a Martin), and they formulate those strings for players like me; casual players that want ring and sustain, that want a long life from their strings, want to minimize breakage, and that play the style that I do, which is, mostly chords, some fingerstyle, some flatpicking, etc.

Try a few on for size and see what you like. Talk to your shop guy, he probably plays, and probably has an opinion, and it is probably as worthless as mine! 

 




 Didn't think about cutting a blank to use as a template! Genius! I had planned on using a press (homemade, of course!) with the bit I was fantasizing about existing, with the wood clamped down. But the template thing might work for me; the goal is to cut a significantly large amount of same-sized discs. 




 Saw these when I made the trip to my local HD...but when I asked the orangeman if they had arbors without the drill bit I just got a blank stare.... 




 It seems so simple, but I cannot find what I'm looking for. I need a hole saw. But every one that I have found has the pilot bit on the arbor. I'm looking for a hole saw bit without the pilot bit. (I don't need the hole, I need the circle of wood...without a hole in the middle!) What is this thing called, and where can I find it? Gotta be quicker and more exact than my jigsaw! 




 1. Collect letters from all women missing panties, politely explaining that he should stop, but that they understand that he has a fetish that makes him do this.

2. Collect panties from all women involved.

3. Get a box. 

4. In the box from top to bottom should be:

* A typewriten note stating that you are still friends, hope this helps, enjoy the panties.
* Letters from the women involved.

* Panties.

* In the bottom of the box, include a picture of all the men that have had GF missing panties, dressed in the panties that are in the box, and nothing else. Dissapproving looks a bonus here.

Mail the box off, and wait. Something should happen. 




 Hmmm...Depends. If the eggroll was Chinese style, you most likely are looking at a snake fang. This signifies good luck in the Chinese culture. The tradition is that whoever ends up with that snake fang stuck in their upper gum is considered the "winner" and you should return to the restaurant/store for your prize!

If the eggroll was Japanese style however, it's probably a bird's talon, and it means that you have been marked for assassination by the Yakuza. You should probably find a safe house, lay low for a while.

If the eggroll was any other Oriental style, than you probably have a cat claw there....nothing to worry about. In this down economy, many eggroll manufacturers and restaurants are cost cutting however they can!

But, a word of caution, if this was an American style eggroll, you have found what is locally called "a reason to sue the shit tits off of somebody" and should lawyer up and get ready for your payday, even though there was no real harm to you.

Hope this helped!

Expertise: I've eaten like 14,000 eggrolls in my life. But I ain't never seent nothin like that! 









 As much as I love Family Guy, I save all my props for the music that you guys do...really over the top, and we appreciate it! Any thoughts about a full length Family Guy musical?
 




 These people must not ever have heard of the internet. When you tell us "Hey, don't manipulate this picture in any way" we say "Challenge accepted." 




 I would totally go check out someone who calls themselves Slappy McNuts....I don't know why, but I would have to know. I don't know what kind of performance I would expect, however. 




 Have you considered Slappy McNuts? Just off the top of my head... 




 Worth the read. It reminds me of some of King's early work, especially some of the short stories. Also, read his other works (Heart shaped box and 20th Century Ghosts)...he shows his father's quirk of linking his stories together. (BTW...20th Century Ghosts is outstanding, if a little confusing.) 




 I barely fit in them too...sometimes it's like carrying around a hotdog in a hefty bag. So what do you do? Tie it off with a bread tie? Duct tape? Rubber bands?  




 Nope...that's easy...awww, hell!! Bastard!

 Read on. 




 That's the one. It reads a bit like a textbook, but I believe that investing the time to get to know your DAW is going to help you in the long run. Happy recording! 




 Love it. Will buy, even not knowing what mold! 




 1. Not a lot of info here, but first guess is that if it's not showing in your VST plugin list it's because you haven't added it to your VST plugin list yet (those are two different actions). 

2. Hopefully it came with a book. Read it. Read it again. Take notes. Reference it. I love my cubase, but if I had any real complaints about it, it would be that it doesn't have a real "natural user feel" to it...there is a big learning curve. I use 4 still, and I'm still learning. Also check out [Steinberg.net](http://www.steinberg.net/en/home.html) for specific info about cubase, and [tweakheadz.com](http://tweakheadz.com) for general recording tips.

3. I love my cubase. It was built for digital (dance, edm, electronica, etc) but I use it for (mostly) live recording, and like more than any other DAW that I've used. Use the trial, if you like it, pull the trigger on the full version.
 









 I do all right playing the blues, but I play by ears and heart. I've heard some guys rip SRV perfectly, but it somehow misses something...Stevie had some reason for those notes that the rest of us can only experience, never replicate. 




 Pork, red onions, pineapple (or mango), plus spiciness. Yum. 




 I have no practical advice to give you, so I'll share a George Carlin quote instead. 

"It's not enough to know *how* to play the blues, you must know *why* to play the blues." 




 Strums for each chord, or rhythmic strumming pattern would depend on song and player choice. Assuming our example song is in 4/4 (common) time, you would have a lot of options.
 Whole note strumming would be strumming the chord one time, and letting ring for the other three counts of each four beat measure (Strum-two-three-four).  Half-note strumming would be strum-two-strum-four. This is way over simplified, as most rhythmic strumming is going to be a mixture of up and down strums, at a mixture of tempo, depending on song and player.

If you're asking for practice reasons, the easiest answer, for a 4/4 song, is to strum each chord four times per measure (quarter-note strumming). Your example song would be: E,E,E,E,D,D,D,D,G,G,G,G,A,A,A,A, in the 1-2-3-4 manner. 




 Ummm...all of them? Most of them, really. Not into bigger girls too much, but I that doesn't mean that I haven't found an individual bigger girl sexy. I'm probably the wrong dude to answer this, because yes, I love me some sexy bodies, but I am so easily turned off by negative attitudes, poor intelligence, unwilling spirit, etc. Give me an average looking girl with a can-do attitude, and I found the sexiest girl alive! 




 Slow cooking really is as easy as everyone says. But here's some protips:

* I really recommend against cooking from frozen due to the food being in the temperature danger zone for more than four hours. Most of the time you're going to be safe, but it's that one time that will change your life. Food-bourne illnesses will make you want to be dead. Thaw your meats a day ahead of time.

* Red meats really benefit from browning before crocking. If you have time, cut steaks into 1 ro 2" cubes, brown in oil, salt and pepper, (don't cook them, just brown the outside) and toss in the crock. Extra flavor here we come!

* Crocking generally means that you're cooking with a liquid. Over that large amount of time, your liquids are going to concentrate somewhat. Be careful when adding spices. If you put two tablespoons of salt in two cups of water, you're gonna come back to two tablespoons of salt in 3/4 cup of water. I add little spice/flavor at the beginning, taste about one hour before you expect to eat, and adjust accordingly.

* Don't be afraid of bone-in meat. Crock it, pull the bones. Slow heat breaks down all kinds of connective tissue, that's why crocking is so awesome.

* Because of above, don't be afraid of discount cuts of meat. Chuck roasts, chicken thigh, random chops of pork are all great meats that will break down easily.

* I had a horrible experience trying something with fish. I don't recommend it. But that's just me.

* Check recipes for ideas. You don't need recipes, but there are a lot of really cool ideas to crock up. Recipe is meat+liquid+seasoning+time. Simple.

* Have fun, and remember to turn your crock off when you're done with it. Worst baked on disaster ever! 




 No matter how much you shake and dance, the last drop always ends up in your pants. 




 Your school has nice balls. 




 Would also add a big hurdle for me to jump over, and hard lesson learned..

You are never "done" writing a song.

I've changed my songs over and over and over again. Each time I play it, it seems like I see an opportunity to improve the message the lyrics were trying to convey, or a slightly more fitting guitar phrase that fits the mood of the song. 

I have songs that I've been working on since a teenager, and while my friends from high school would probably recognize the song that I play for them, they would also recognize that it's nothing like the one they heard the first time, oh so long ago. 




 I've tried to share Zach Deputy on reddit so many different times...and nobody seems to appreciate him. Part of the problem is most of the YT vids are just not showing what it's like to see him live. Huge fan from FL, loving seeing someone else rep ZD! 




 In Boca, there is nothing to do but wait to die, and count old people. Enjoy the beach.
 




 I'm gonna go with... all of them. Hated the 90's. At least pop stuff. 




 Whatever you do, do not dumb yourself down. You might attract guys, but they might be the wrong kind. The reason that you are getting approached by older men are because older men (me!) also exude confidence, and generally have our shit together. 

Way I see it, two options: One, start talking to people, making plans, and starting things on your own. Not necessaryily asking guys out on dates, but start organising things on your own. If guys can talk to you a bit and get to know you, and find that you aren't that intimidating, your prospects might go up. Inversely, just start chatting the guys up, and go on and exude your confindence. Ask them..."So, when are you going to ask me out on a date?" Stay friendly, and I hope you find what you're looking for. (I did!) 




 True, and I stated that in my comment. My point was how many people are taking that little blue pill, not because they have limpus dickus, but because "the tv told me to ask my doctor"? 




 Wasn't selling "Uncle Leroy's Calmative" out of the back of a horse drawn trailer a business model? I can see the comparison. 




 True enough. I didn't think of energy drinks as "medicine"...I was looking more at big pharma taking the place of snake oil salesmen.
 




 Quacks and snake oil aren't really the issue anymore. Science has paved the way for a new style of schyster. 

It seems like now the goal is to develop the drug alongside the symptoms...diseases that we've never heard of now get nationwide commercial coverage as we discuss Restless Leg Syndrome, or how often a dude over 50 is supposed to be pissing.

I'm not belittling people that have real issues that need real medicine to help them, but how much were we as a nation discussing Erectile Dysfunction before the advent of Viagara? It seems from the content of commericial advertising that just about every healthy male over the age of 50 or so is in dire need of propping up their boners so their hot middle aged wife doesn't leave them for the tennis instructor. Same thing with ADD, ADHD, MAOI's, and the pharmacopia of antidepressants that are now available.

In short, why have fake meds when we can count on fake (ok, not fake, but trumped up, overstated, or broadly and casually diagnosed )diseases to make "real" meds for? 




 I would also suggest offering a small reward if you wanted the physical card returned to you (enough to cover postage and a bit to sweeten the deal) or specifying that you just want the data and providing an email address or website for the pics/data to be uploaded to.  




 To be considered an "Advanced" guitar player, the player must:

* Show up fifteen minutes late to practice. At least.

* Have visible tattoos/piercings. (Face tattoos will be accepted as a substitute for piercings, but multiple piercings will not be accepted in lieu of tattoos.)

* Refusal to carry any gear but his/her own to and from gigs.

* Must have one of the following: (Consistent alcoholism, recurring mental issues, or recovering addiction to hard drugs. (Marijuana does **not** count.))

* Must also have one of these advanced habits: (Playing parts of songs that the band does not know/perform while lead singer engages the crowd, the ability to sing backups in a mike that is not hot, or the ability to cue primadonna meltdowns on cue.)

And of course....**19**. 




 Love to throw with you, or buy you a beer. I'm bringing the team from New Smyrna down, six of us, to check out what Wickam Park has to offer. 




 Nice to see this. I've been talking about the "Big Mac Effect" for a long time, both on line and in person, declaring that as long as Joe Schmo can hit up the local McDonalds and get a Big Mac for a couple bucks, he's gonna think that everything's all right with the world. It's good to see some hard science that shows this. 




 Hmmm....bite two corners off my BBQ hot pocket and blow through the thing? Are you trying to get me to cool my hot pocket, or defaceify my wife? This seems like it could be a terrible idea....that I'm gonna try anyway! Look out puppies/wife/small children, daddy's blowing a lava pocket! 




 Upvote for visibility....better follow through. And be careful. They don't like being filmed when working, they certainly aren't going to like this.
 




 12" to 16", assuming your breath is okay. Any closer and you look a little rapey. 




 [Disco Duck](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxf2KCSyvgQ) (Yes seriously.) It was done by a radio dj and his band, Rick Dees and his Cast of Idiots. It was on an album of "funny" songs, lots of stuff that would have been featured on Dr. Demento's show. I was about five or six at the time. 




 Yep, got a lot to work with there. I should be ok. I'll just have another diet Dr. Pepper...*pop *fizz * slurp....shit, now I'm energetically depressed! Hand me my guitar and that pipe over there! *spark *puff *aaaahhhh...much better. 




 But the people on tv look so happy when they drink diet Dr. Pepper...has the doctor been lying to me? But, I drink diet sodas for my caffeine addiction, so I'm more likely to develop depression by drinking a beverage that reduces my chance of developing depression? Fuck, I'm confused. Probably all the diet sodas. 




 I've got a quick wit and an even quicker mouth, and it's gotten me into trouble plenty in the past...with gf/parents/job/school.

Got better and better jobs which required me to not act like a drunk monkey on a daily basis, and struggled with both cursing, and content, of what I was saying.

I developed what I call the "2 beat rule". Whenever I start to say something, I take just two beats (ill-defined segment of time, but long enough to review my intended statement) and think about what the other person will hear if I say what I'm about to say. 

More often than not, I choose to say nothing, because what I hear in my head suddenly sounds hurtful or base. 

But I let it rip later when I'm at the bar!

Good luck. Being aware of your language and the way you use it is really the first step. Whatever steps you take next will more than likely work because you have already identified a habit that you want to change. 




 Every Asshole Does Grass But Eggbert is how I learned them back in the stone age! 




 Nope. I liked the remake for the multiplayer, the level play was quite weak though. 




 yep, exactly...cool sound to add to your repertoire on acoustic. 




 Goldeneye. Nintendo 64 or WII. 




 Ahh...the good old Teapot Dome scandal! Good God I love history! 




 1. Probably the post WWII to Vietnam era.

2. Civil War.

3. Lots. I had a really awesome teacher in HS, and we talked about a lot of things that were left out of our sanitized textbooks. I wish I had spent more time with him, but he inspired me to look for my own truths, and I have for the last thirty years. Thank you, Mr. Postlethaite, OHS!

4. You could...maybe group SMS for historical events? Today in history, or that sort of thing...

5. I am an employer, but I don't think I care about your knowledge of US history, outside of if you had a college degree, because any degree is a good thing.


Thanks for being a teacher, keep up the good work! 




 Sounds like reasonable parenting, so that's probably not an issue. And good relationships at home (I'm still a fan of stay at home parents, doesn't matter which one!). ANd I read RefuseBit's comment, and wonder if maybe that might be part of it...eight is a strange age, he might be gifted, but without the ability/vocabulary to express his interests, combined with his sort of timidness might lead to the kind of behavior that he's evincing. 

Overall, I think he bears watching, but I wouldn't overworry. You sound like a cool aunt/uncle; stay involved, and help him evolve, and take him back to the lab! My kids would be so jealous! 




 It was awesome of her, and I'm lucky, because she has been and still is adventurous, and we've had much fun because of that...but I still know that I haven't made up for that night...lol. I hope it works out awesome for all three of you guys!
 




 I would be thrilled beyond belief. I've talked to my SO about this before, and it doesn't seem to be her thing, but a guy can hope! I would say be careful, because you just don't know where his head might be at any given day...you would want to tease him, give him clues about what was about to happen instead of an outright surprise.

Let me share a story with you. 

Long ago, before my wife was my wife, I was working at a restaurant near the house. A bit too far to ride the bike, she would give me a ride and pick me up at night when I got off, around midnight most nights.

She comes to pick me up, and I open the door to slide into the car, and there she is, my beautiful eventual wife, in all her naked glory, sitting in the driver's seat.

Unlike every other guy in the world, instead of being thrilled about this turn of events, I half-smirk, say something stupid, and get in the car to go home. (I don't remember what I said, my wife's a redditor, perhaps she'll stop by and tell you what dumb thing I said instead of telling her how beautiful she is, or how impressed I was with her being so brave to surprise me by picking me up completely naked.)

What she didn't know is that I had just gone through one of the worst days of work I had ever had. To her credit, I no longer remember what was so terrible that night, I just have a very clear memory of her amazing naked body shining in the dome light of her VW Rabbit! 

Just sayin' be careful of an outright surprise...you might not get the disired result. You probably will, but there's that outside chance that his head might not be in the right place...and it would be terrible if another man on this planet was stupid enough to ruin something awesome by not being able to shift gears fast enough!

    (sorry babe!) 




 Keep the pick hand moving during the ring-out portion of the chord, just lift the pick off the strings.

Practice this by keeping the 16th notes by percussing them with your pick on your pick guard while the chord rings out.

Essentially you will be working on two seperate rhythms at that point, one strum, one percussive...eventually you will be able to just skip the percussive part, and feel that staggered rhythmic pattern. 




 Father of two, boy 8, girl 5.

A lot of the behavior that you talk about when he was visiting the lab seems pretty normal to me, or at least age appropriate. My boy is not real "hands on" with new stuff, but he loves to learn new things and be around new things. I think that if he went to work with his uncle (not a scientist (how cool!) but road construction) he would love all the machines and cool stuff, but might be leery of actually getting involved. Some boys are different, and would be all kinds of hands on, to the point of seeming like mania.

The defiance could be described as normal for his age group as well. This is the time that they start to understand themselves, and he may be pushing the boundries to see what he can get away with. How's the mom and dad at home? If they're allowing this behavior to go unchecked or are unwilling disciplanarians, they might be fostering these sorts of problems. (When you describe impatience for future goals/rewards and change of situational difficulties, it sounds like he's maybe not getting negative reinforcement of these behaviors at home.)

The scaredness, (or timidness) that I sensed you were talking about might be something that you should watch. It could mean a lot of different things; from the relatively normal i.e. he's just sensitive/timid, to the relatively severe i.e. he's got something either real or imaginary to be scared of, and is acting on these feelings.

Overall, he sounds kinda like a normal eight year old boy to me, assuming all developmental skills are about where they are supposed to be. 

How's the relationship in between the boy and his parents? Are they stern enough in their demands about his diet, his habits, his bedtime ritual? Or are they enabling his bad behavior by not being resolute? Did this behavior maybe start as a reaction to the new child in the house? Hopefully there's no overt favortism between the two children. Without knowing much more, I can be of no help, but overall, outside of the timidness/anxiety he doesn't sound that much different from my boy.

 




 Duuuuuuddde...really? Out in the rain? Ouch.

Sad to say, you might be fucked. You might be able to fool the folks at Taylor (read that: Fraud), but if they want to see the demolished piece of art that was your 714, they will see the water damage. If your warranty is through Taylor, might be worth contacting them and telling them that you're an idiot and maybe, just maybe, they might take pity on you. Doubtful, but possible. Outside warranty, probably best to try to go with fraud. 

I'm sorry for your loss. Hope you have a backup box so you can still play the blues!
 




 1. 40

2. Full time manager

3. 14M (step-son, part time contact), 8M (at home), 5F (at home).

4. Job doesnt give me traditional weekday/weekend, but I have five work days, two off, so whatev. Typical day starts around 7am. Breakfast. One hour of either TV or video games. (assuming not a schoolday). One to two hours of self-play, generally in their rooms, sometimes outside. Together time until lunch. Lunch. Open afternoons, depends on what has to happen that day, sometimes errands, sometimes recreations, sometimes crafts. Dinner preparation is family time, dinner is family time. After dinner routine that leads to bedtime. Good is being a dad, stressful is getting young kids to do stuff together is like trying to herd cats. 

5. Struggling to make every day relevant, and stay involvled with the kids. I'm tired all the time, and work too much, so is tough to stay involved instead of just sleeping all day.

6. I don't really ever feel defeated as a parent. I generally feel that I'm doing a better job than most dads in similar situations.

7. Not really reliant on goods or services when it comes to the kids, but in the spirit of the question, would have to say either Netflix/Internet, or the Wii. They both allow the kids some time doing something that I only have to half supervise, allowing me time to do some grown-up things. 




 The very reason I can't suggest The Joy of Cooking enough is because it can be read *both* as a textbook **and** a cookbook. As far as skill set, there is an assumption that you've been in the kitchen before, but the "About" sections that preface each subject area covers more advanced cooking methods and such. Just a few days ago, I couldn't remember for the life of me how long to boil carrots (i could have just watched them, but I had other stuff on the stove, and that was the first step in a recipe) and I quick referenced my Joy so I could work on my timetable. 

Check your local library and see if they have a copy, and give it a looksee before you pull the trigger, but I wouldn't want to cook in a kitchen that didn't have The Joy of Cooking in it. 




 I have found that many people that have nearly fabulous handwriting hate their handwriting far more than I do...and I have the handwriting of a drunk monkey. Long ago I switched to an all caps scrawl (that I later learned was called Architectual Block Printing) that more easily conveys my message without error. Since switching, people have commented how neat my handwriting is, and I am nothing if not amused at what amounts to a utilitarian choice for legibility being appreciated for its form. 




 Hot Snakes? Awesome! I needed that phrase so badly; it's the holidays! Fuckin' hot snakes! Too broke for gold, have a orangered instead. 

Hot snakes....yessss. 




 A good friend told me that whenever I am faced with a difficult choice to flip a coin...not because you should trust in the random to decide your fate, no matter how small the issue, but because in that brief moment, while the coin is in the air, you will know what your heart truly desires.

I use it without fail. 




 Spend the 50 bucks on beer, get him drunk, take the axes, tell him he told you you could have them. 




 Had to be. Probably riverside, or near Pappa's. 




 I've seen some terrible things here in the N.S.B., but I've been lucky enough to avoid this. Must be mainland, shit like that just doesn't happen on the island. 




 Thank goodness for that giant red arrow. I wouldn't have been sure what to look at in that video. 

"Oh, look at all these people standing around watching something...meh, that's pretty cool, I guess"

"Wait, what's this red arrow?"

"Holy shit, a fucking elephant, fuckin' shit up!"

Thanks Red Arrow! 




 Yep, still checking the fish about whenever I bring new fish in...no questions on best preparations, how to clean/gut/scale, etc. 




 I am not familiar with the class, so my opinion may be uninformed, but I would think short of a professional culinary instruction in a classroom setting, that you would be wasting that $50.

First, take that $50 bucks, and buy [The Joy of Cooking](http://www.amazon.com/Joy-Cooking-75th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/0743246268/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1356534467 sr=8-1 keywords=the+joy+of+cooking)...not your typical "Cookbook"...it has plenty of recipes, but each section/chapter is prefaced with the "why" of cooking...why heat causes meat to brown, why you must scale certain types of fish, why herbs are best fresh, etc. Great book, and constant companion of mine while in culinary school, at home, and at work. And, you can spend that thirty bucks left over on something nice.

I don't know where you live, but any medium sized metro area is going to have classes offered on a single basis (i.e. outside a degree program). Check places that focus on alternative eating...fresh markets, vegetarian/vegan shops, etc...these places often will offer a single class on a single subject for a reasonable amount of dough.

And can't say enough about experience...one of the best ways to get a feel for your kitchen is to spend a lot of time in it! And take notes. seriously....if you are having problems with consistency when it comes to seasoning, start note taking and measuring what you're using, and then make notes about how you felt about the taste, adjust next time, take more notes, fine tune, end up with something that works for you, and is probably pretty tasty! 




 Right there with you. I brought it up to my wife, and she's given it a go a few times, but she says it's not her thing. Makes her happy to see me have a good time, but can't get her to initiate without having to almost beg. I think it's maybe more taboo for a female to be on the giving end of anal than it is to be on the receiving?...either way, it still makes me happy, and every now and then is better than never now or then, right?

 Depends on what you mean by artifacts. There haven't been people here for very long, but you can still find traces of them. I've personally [walked through a fort in Florida that was constructed in 1672](http://www.nps.gov/casa/historyculture/index.htm), [found bullets and a piece of a belt buckle at the sight of a civil war battle in Florida](http://battleofolustee.org/battle.html), [taken gravestone rubbings of some of the oldest graves in Northern Florida](http://www.seefloridaonline.com/_tallahassee/cemetery.html), and [got to see 120,000 year old mastadon bones dug up right in my city!](http://www.news-journalonline.com/article/20120929/NEWS/309299990/1064?Title=Prehistoric-passion-Mastodon-bones-draw-crowd-to-museum) 




 I hope you are who you are. I wish that you would message the mods some proof. Lacking that, let me begin...

I am so sorry for your loss. I know that means nothing, but I sat at work Friday morning, watching the coverage, and barely controlled my tears as I thought of those poor children, and those poor parents. My heart, and the thoughts of my entire family, have been with the parents and families of Sandy Hook for the past few days.

Question: How exposed were you to the media coverage, and what, overall, sort of job do you think the major media did to cover this story? And, do you feel that that sort of coverage is appropriate? Is this a tragedy for the nation, or should it have been a little more low-key?

 









 Dio!!! 




 I hear ya. I run a small club, and we limit to ten people, but we play way early on Thursday mornings on an uncrowded course, and stay very aware of people coming up behind us, usually giving way for playthrough a hole ahead of them. But that happens rarely.

More often, our group gets stuck behind a group of two or three that have never played before, and chuck plastic into the woods like there's no tomorrow, and most of the time, after explaining etiquette, and exchanging tips, we both go our serarate ways, happy...but not always....not always. 




 I love Fat Tuesday's! Used to have one here in Daytona, but they took it away from me! Now when I need delicious adult frozen beverages, I must buy them at 7-11, and pour FourLokos in them! But, a sad bonus, because of the 7-11 cup, I can bring them most anywhere! 




 I've taken a Jung test before, didn't really understand it too much. Found you guys, (/r/INTJ first, followed the link, took my test, looked for you, found you) and after a brief bit of googleresearch and reading through the posts here...wow. Just wow. Didn't realize that there were so many people like me out there. Happy to find you.

Minus sign  (  ) to exclude


Placing  a minus sign immediately before a word indicates that you do not want pages that contain this word to appear in your results. The minus sign should appear immediately before the word and should be preceded with a space. For example, in the query [ anti-virus software ], the minus sign is used as a hyphen and will not be interpreted as an exclusion symbol; whereas the query:  [ anti-virus software ] will search for the words 'anti-virus' but exclude references to software. You can exclude as many words as you want by using the  sign in front of all of them, for example [ jaguar cars football os ]. The  sign can be used to exclude more than just words. For example, place a minus sign before the 'site:' operator (without a space) to exclude a specific site from your search results.

 I'll be honest with you. I care. Really. I'm a father, 5 and 8, the same age as some of those kids that were shot and killed today. 

I'm a man, a burly manly, Ron Swanson type man.

I was at work, and had trouble controlling my emotions as I watched the events in Newtown unfold.

I don't know the families....but I have a family. I don't know the victims, but I felt like a victim, in a very very small way compared to what those people were dealing with, for the loss of innocence, of safety, of feeling like it was totally okay to drop my kids off at school in the morning, and know that they would be there when I showed up to pick them up.

I'm aware of the situation in the Congo, I know about the humanitarian crisis in most of sub-saharan Africa. I don't know much about Burma, but I've been following the stories out of Syria. Terrible things happen all the time.

But sometimes I forget that. I'm American. Most of the time, things are pretty okay here. 

Not today.

Sensationalism? I agree with you; if more attention was paid to the crises in other parts of the world, it might be easier to empathize with them.

But this was our home. Done by one of us. To some of us.

I made a FB post about it...I didn't know what else to do. I just wanted to cry, or to find my kids and hug them, and hold them close, knowing that they were okay, and that I could still protect them from the harsh ugliness of the world. I wanted to do more...more to help those people, more to feel like I was protecting my kids.

I don't grieve for them...I didn't know any of them, but I grieve for the innocence of my kids. I will spend a large portion of my day tomorrow talking about this with them; having a difficult conversation with two very young people that I care very much about, that I love more than anything else in this world; a conversation where I must admit, as their father, their protector, their rock, that yes, there are bad people in this world, the boogie monster is real sometimes, there might be someone that wants to do you and/or your family harm.

I'll tell them that the most important thing is to be careful, aware, and safe.

I'll tell them that we are a family, and that we will do anything we can to protect each other.

I'll tell them what I have to, to make them feel okay again.

And I wish that I could do that for the families that lost children today.

And I wish that someone could tell me that everything that I've worried about today was nothing. That I didn't have to worry about ever losing my children to violence or accident.

But today proved that no one can do that for me. And there are parents out there, right now, that learned an even more difficult lesson.

I may have no business grieving or not grieving for the pain and challenges of strangers, but I won't apologize for the emotions that I have as I witness the loss of these kids...the loss of these families...the loss that we *all* felt today, because of a silly notion of whether I have a right to or not. 




 No problem. It's hard sometimes when you realize how exposed our children are to the hurt and bad and ugly in this world. I'll be sharing something I learned from Mr. Rogers long long ago. Words from his mother... 

"When you see something bad happen, remember that there are helpers. If you look, you will find them, people that are helping other people. Know they are there, and find hope when you see them." 









 Yep, I saw those in the wild the other day, but didn't have the balls to buy and try...I was shopping with my wife; when I do, I leave the balls at home.

 Florida is a "right to work" state.

I am a manager with about 30 employees here in Florida.

As far as I can tell, "Right to work" here in Florida means that "Right to fire your sorry ass whenever the fuck I want for no apparent reason, and good luck getting any Unemployment Compensation or Welfare, you stupid no job-having poor person!"

As far as I can tell, anyway. 




 Donny Osmond fronting Megadeth. Or Brittney Spears fronting GWAR. Either one, really. 




 I don't know, I've made some pretty epic fail decisions in my time.
 









 All of them. Every. Single. One. 




  Discs do not fly out of your bag by themselves and hit trees.

I don't know, have you played a bad round with me before? It sure can seem like that...lol.

Seriously, glad to hear somebody else say it. I run a little club, and I see it all the time. New disc, show it off, throw it once, hook it, throw it in the sales pile. 




 Waxing! *slaps forehead...didn't even think of that. 




 Semi assembled. Free wheel assembly is done, crank assembly is done. 




 I'm putting together a new beach cruiser for Christmas. I'm confident in my abilities to do so, but had a few questions that you could maybe help me with?

* Gotta lube up those metal on metal parts, right? What lube? Silicone, 3in1, poly, teflon? What's best for me? (I live on the beach, btw.)

* Rust proofing! I live on the beach, and chrome is no match for the salt. What do? I bought a bike that has a minimum of chrome (handlebars, rims, and spokes)...how can I weatherproof these areas (hopefully semi-permanantly) so that they don't rust out?

* Any other tips and tricks that a noob like me needs to know before putting together a bike for the first time?

Thanks /bikewrench! 




 How much is this plastic frog figurine? 




 Fuck CC, they fired Bull from RealRadio 104.1 in Orlando. There's noise that they might be canning more.  




 Open mikes, open jams. Post your own CL add with clear expectations. Do some shitty gigs, and spread the word. Check sites like Bandmix.com. Keep trying. Takes time, so take your time. 




 I don't get depressed and I wouldn't let my kids get upset either. I like it when there is no one on the playground, it means Daddy gets to go wild! (A serious side note, as a father, a hairy, burly one, I often suffer from stares and watchful looks when on the playground with the kids, especially when I go (with them) by myself. It's a whole lot better when there is no one there.) 




 Long ago, Bill Cosby used to be funny. Why Is There Air is the beginning of his unfunny decline into the goofy faced jello pop slinging pudding pimp Huxtable shamed idiot that we all remember from Thursday nights at 8 in the '80's. Listen to it, it ain't so bad.

 Absolutely. I'm glad somebody said it. But while I have you here, what's the best thing for me to watch videos on my TV? Should I go with an off the shelf Roku, or maybe jailbreak an Apple TV with XBMC?  




 Not necessarily, remember that Stan knew something the rest of the Losers did not...[that It was pregnant](/spoiler), still not a gunslinger move, but [Susannah waved off the quest at the very end of her own choice as well.](/spoiler) Some things are too big, even for gunslingers; or, if you prefer, Roland was a gunslinger's gunslinger. 




 When I play alone, I can't get high...no focus. Fun to just fuck around with the guitar when I've been smoking, but not for practice. When playing with other people however, especially ones that I am comfortable with, it adds confidence and overall jamability. 

But maybe that's just me. 




 There be a crib up in New Orleans
They call tha Risin Sun
And itz been tha ruin of nuff a skanky boy
And Dogg I know I be one

My fuckin mutha was a tailor
Biatch sewed mah freshly smoked up blue jeans
My fuckin daddy was a gamblin' man
Down up in New Orleans

Now tha only muthafuckin thang a gambla needs
Is a suitcase n' trunk
And tha only time he be straight satisfied
Is when he be straight on a drunk

Oh mutha rap r children
Not ta do what tha fuck I have done
Spend yo' lives up in sin n' misery
In tha Crib of tha Risin Sun

Well, I gotz one foot on tha platform
Da other foot on tha train
I be goin' back ta New Orleans
To wear dat bizzle n' chain

Well, there be a crib up in New Orleans
They call tha Risin Sun
And itz been tha ruin of nuff a skanky boy
And Dogg I know I be one

 New Smyrna Beach, FL, sharkbite capital of the world! 




 Skinny girls. 




 Thats a really good idea, I'll float it to the club and see what we think.
 




 Planned on that...most of what I've seen so far has been about league play assuming handicaps were already figured, but I did do a pretty broad google. 




 And to keep score.  




 I gave the forums a cursory glance, and didn't see anything right away, but will check more when I get off work. I thought about two pools, but the group's not quite big enough for two or more pools yet. 




 Everybody has suggested that, and we thought about a "challenge day" of doing that very thing, but we play with someone who is ambidextrous...but we could make him play with his feet... 




 Will do, didn't think about looking there. Checked DiscGolfersR.us and didn't see much. 




 No, for real, I just don't get it. Anybody want to give me some tips? I want to take our little amatuer league to the next level, but I can't bring in better players and worse players than are already involved and keep it fun (and fair) for everyone.

So, how would you handicap a small club?

* We play on one course only (relatively easy, relatively short, highly technical)

* There are currently 10 players, but we want to expand.

* Co-ed.

* Skill levels from experienced to brand noob.

* Cash is involved, so must be fair, and managable.

* Once a week play, one round (18 holes) only. 




 I've been looking at those on amazon! I just don't know what the hell they are and what they do. Gonna have to do more research. 




 We checked that out at our local library, but I didn't see her get too excited about anything in it. I was thinking about something like books of patterns, or parts...like how to do pockets, corners, double seams, etc. 




 Well, I am the epitome of dudeness...she sews skirts, kids clothes, baby blankets, embellishments to store bought clothes...quilts a little (I'm assuming the definition of "quilts" as "stuffed squares sewn together"). She has a pinterest, but just started, and I know what's on it, but mostly stuff that falls into the "other crafts" category. She also does great work with over the shoulder bags. 




 Tough call. The Cameo looks like it would be better for what we do...(not just for sewing, we screenprint too). Have to think about that... 




 She's set as far as a sewing machine...for now. We've looked at some higher end options, but that's a later-on gift. A serger is something that she has mentioned. 




 I wouldn't even begin to guess about patterns and fabric for her! 




 She's a machine sewer mostly, but she does quilting as well.  




 I was thinking about GCs as well, but for the wife (that's why I'm asking) it seems a little impersonal, at least as the main gift.
 




 A serger might be a little out of my price range...but interesting. I don't know what they do, or if it would be appropriate as a gift for my wife, but the Cameo...a little pricey, but could work for a couple of different crafts. What do you think about lower priced comparibles to the Cameo Sillhouette? 




 Love those, but that would be a better gift for me than for her! 




 A light is something that I've been considering. Also scissors, because I'm husband, and kids. Would little stuff like pins, thimbles, needles, pincushions be safe? Or would you be super particular about what you get?
 




 I'm asking for ideas for my wife...isn't a husband buying his wife an iron grounds for divorce? But seriously, a nice iron would be a good gift? She has one, but it's older than our relationship...lol. 




 Lol...I'm a he, asking to get some ideas for my wife...I'm so lost when it comes to this stuff! (I'd love to get her a high end machine, but a grand is a little out of our budget!) 









 That comment just is begging for me to yell out "Your Mom!", but I think you're asking where I live? Volusia County, New Smyrna Beach, take 44 out of Eustis, head east until you hit the beach, and I'm on the right. 




 The easy answer is Space Monkey. Why? It's epicness is only overshadowed by the obvious need of my blank wall to support Space Monkey Art. I would hang this in my music studio (corner of my living room) and create a song about Space Monkey for Collage-o-rama. What you do with it at that point is up to you! 

Space Monkey Mafia, Unite! 




 I started surfing long long ago, but gave it up after I moved away from the coast. After many many years, I found myself back on the east coast of Florida, surrounded by new friends and decent waves. So I'll share the story of the first time I returned to surfing.

Some old friends of mine planned a trip to the coast to come see me and casually mentioned getting some wavetime in. I hadn't been surfing for about 20 years at that point, but figured what the hell, can't be too hard.

I went down to my local surf shop and picked up a used long board, 9.6 softtop, and told my friend that our weekend would be a go.

Over the next couple weeks as I waited in anticipation for good friends and good times, I tried to make time to get out and practice a couple of times, but just couldn't find time. (I work way too much).

The week before our surf weekend, checking the weather showed me that there was a storm developing. A big one. Might be Cat 1 hurricane, well offshore, by the weekend we had plans. Didn't worry too much, just thought we'd get some solid waves.

Nope.

The day before my friends came down, I went over to the shore to check the waves. It was washing machine time, but on steriods. The waves were big, but no rhythm, no sets, just muddy, and **angry** looking large chop.

I went home hoping for a better look the next day.

Friends showed up early, about dawn, and we checked the beach out immeadiately. If anything, it had gotten worse. My friends were determined to try it anyway, and I wasn't going to be the one to say no.

Two of my friends had some surf experience; long boards on the north florida gulf shore, and one was from some center of the country state that had never seen water larger than a lake, and didn't know jack about surfing.

So we get ready, and decide to have a couple of cans of liquid courage before we head across the street to defeat the monster. Heads held high, and feeling no pain, we carry our boards over to the shore.

We get out into the muck. My two friends with longboard experience have slightly less trouble than I do getting through the muck to search for the break, such as it was.

I had a moment where I knew things were going to go bad. My neighbors are all surf shop monkeys, and two of them were out in the muck, body boarding. As I struggled to get past the chop, one of them drifted close to me and said "you're either really brave or really stupid, bro!". I almost turned around at that point.

Almost.

By then, my friends are out trying to catch a few. Doing okay. The third friend, no surfing experience, is sort of just drifting down the beach, getting his ears washed out for him.

I finally get out of the mess, sort of on the back side of the break, and I straddle my board to catch my breath, and take in my surroundings.

Friends one and two are surfing. Not great, but there were waves, they were just short lived and messy. Friend three, no where to be seen.

Relaxing for maybe too long, I notice that I'm drifting not just down the beach, but out. I'm heading to Africa, so I paddle in a bit to try and catch my first wave.

I'm just paddling casually, not pushing hard, just coming in, and I feel a bit of upwelling lift me up. Out of nowhere, I've paddled on top of a monster. (It was a monster to me!) The wave develops underneath me, and I've surfed a bunch back in the day, but never saw a wave develop from that point of view, not on the face, not on the front, but teetering on top. 

I'm not so much paddling into the wave now as much as I'm falling into it, so I get up to me knees as I'm dropping in to this wave curling underneath me.

I surfed for about 1.6 milliseconds.

The wave buried me, tossed and turned, took a nasty hit from the board, had to push off the bottom to get a few whitewater breaths, tossed and turned, yanked by my leash, finally get my head above water, and start heading in.

I get to shore right about the time the lifeguard gets to me. I sort of plop down in front of him, he's asking if I'm alright, I'm embarrassed as shit, and tourists are gathering. One of them points out that I'm sitting a growing pool of blood. 

Kind of roll over to my side, and my upper thigh, right where it meets buttcheek, is total hamburgered. Took a fin in the crease. Friends gone, embarrassed enough, I wave off anymore help and hobble home to face the wrath of my wife.

Short wrap-up: I make it home, eventually first two friends make it back, we have beers and laughs. Friend three still missing. Finally shows up after hours, just drifted down the beach, and crossed the inlet, ending up in neighboring town, hitched a ride home with beach cops. Drank more, laughed more, did not surf more.

tl;dr. I'm old, don't drink and surf.

 You play hockey in a bathroom stall? Who wins? 




 Good luck. 




 Outstanding.

But your job isn't over yet. Now she knows. You must reinforce this feeling of universal oneness that's going to overcome her by sneaking 42 into her life even more, even more stealthily than before. Have fun! 




 It's just an Em7...you don't have to hate on it. I don't know of any specific song that "features" that chord, but it pops up everywhere. As an acoustic player with a decidedly chucka-chunka style, I use that chord, when it fits, to transition through a lot of chord changes with furious rhythm. 




 I wish you luck, fellow onomotophagic. I tried and tried and tried. I used hot sauce, no bite laquers, gloves, just about everything. It's a tough habit to break. 

Good news? It took six seperate attempts, a little bit of self-loathing, and almost two years, but I haven't bit my nails in a few months now (after biting for over 30 years) with some nice new growth, and going strong!

What finally worked for me was just positive thinking, and telling myself I could do it, and everytime I failed I learned something new about what triggers my addiction.  




 When my wife and I, before we got married, were visiting our doctor about her first pregnancy, his distaste in our unmarried state was evident. My at-the-time-GF and I got into a semi-serious accident on Thanksgiving, about halfway through her pregnancy. She began to suffer from some joint and bone pain in her right hip. We asked our doctor about it on our next visit, and I shit you not, he suggested that we get tested for "bone herpes". 

tl:dr A new study has shown that other people waiting until marriage to have sex makes people that already made that decision feel better about the years of self-repression and frustration that they suffered. 




 It's called [chocolate bloom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_bloom). It's either fat in the form of cocoa butter or crystalline sugar rising to the surface of the chocolate due to temperature extremes or the chocolate not being tempered correctly.
 




 That's a fun joint. Was just out there for the FolkFest last month.
 




 Where in Lake? I live in Volusia, NSB, but I'm in Eustis about once a month or so...my pops owns a place there....cheap beer and acoustic folk rock. [Olivias?](http://oliviascoffeehouse.com/index.asp) 




 Nope. Didn't even go to school here in NSB, didn't care much for high school, and you're describing the folks that I didn't care for when I was in high school 25 years ago. 

What I am is a football fan. HS, college or NFL, I like a good game, and this has been a good year for the 'Cudas. (I am also a fan of HS marching bands, my step-son plays baritone sax for the aforementioned Deland Bulldogs.) I just feel that this whole thing is getting blown way out of proportion. I've seen lots of HS ballgames this year, and years past, and there always is a little tension between the band and the players. They share the same field for warm-ups and pregames, and there just isn't much room at the high school level.  




 I live in New Smyrna Beach, the team that's doing the disrespecting...and we take our football seriously down here. Real serious. 

First, what they did was inappropriate. I hope they are running laps for it still...but the big deal that people are making about this here in the area, and to some degree state- and nationwide, is getting a little ridiculous. They ran too far out on the field? Relax. They'll run. But let's talk about the excitement of hs football here in this part of FL. NSB has swept the table, including big wins against cross county favorite, the Deland Bulldogs, (HS of Mike Gillislee, RB for UF Gators). They're the pick for the District champs this year. Been a few years since we've won Districts, so it's a big deal for the 'Cudas. Spruce Creek, while a great high school, is every other teams' punching bag. Never had a good football program out there, and this last game is sort of the last hurdle NSB Barracudas has to jump on their way to District play.

Creek's band should have been allowed the field to do their pre-game band thing, but let's not beat up a bunch of high school football players that are way excited about a great year of football.

I expect an apology from NSB will arrive at Spruce Creek anytime now, and I'll be wearing my Red and cheering on my 'Cudas next week. 




 It's called "crushing" or "crush fetish".

It's a type of paraphilia that some people get off on, sexually. (How? I don't fuckin' know.)

This chick, I don't know her name, but there has been a few of her vids bouncin' around the internet for a while. She's a "crush" star. (This one was bad...the one where she goes after kittens with high heels is worse.)

[Wikipedia on crushing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crush_fetish)

[And here's a story about a couple that did crush videos and got busted kinda recently.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2191787/Man-woman-arrested-torturing-animals-cutlery-household-tools-shoes-crush-videos-sexual-fetishists.html) 




 Jeezus, where to start?

* I think that if I only sing louder, people will think I sing well.

* I think that I can play guitar really really well. (I can, just not while shithammered.)

* I think that people care about my opinions.

* I think that people that don't care about my opinions will have their minds changed if I yell at them really loudly, causing spit to fly out of my mouth into their eyes.

* I think that talking louder helps me prove my point.

* I often forget my point.

* Whiskey dick.

* I generally will have three or more beers/cocktails working at one time.

* I can never, ever, find my smokes. 




 Women don't understand golf.
