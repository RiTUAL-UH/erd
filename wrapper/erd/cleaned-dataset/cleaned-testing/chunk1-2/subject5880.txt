 Yeah. I don't see any evidence of how vaporizers are marketed to those underage. Flavors can be argued, but 74.4% of 10,000 adult vapers on ECF prefer non tobacco flavors. We can also take a glance at the flavors within the alcohol industry. 

Tobacco marketed to the underage and lied about it under oath in a congressional hearing. 

Also it just goes without saying that Eliquid is not water, and what the fuck is a hefty dose.  




 Formaldehyde comes from dry hits. The largest amounts of formaldehyde are going to be seen in a cheap tank with inefficient wicking speed when paired with too powerful of a battery. [(Farsalinos)] (http://www.ecigarette-research.com/web/index.php/2013-04-07-09-50-07/2014/162-nyt-formald)  




 Bad source. The formaldehyde issue and the nitrosamines issues are inaccurate. Formaldehyde is even less of an issue now that the DNA40 is out with temperature control, but they won't cover that. 

They also wouldn't cover that in a study, propylene glycol mist had a 100% success rate of killing the influenza virus. But no, focus on MRSA. Who the fuck has that anymore.

 Golden ohms requested here ^ 




 They won't regulate liquid nicotine just because it's suspended in pg or vg. They're both, mostly pg, solvents for a lot of medications, and this pure nicotine is used for the creation of nicotine replacement therapies.  




 Diacetyl is commonly not listed. Check out this: http://www.ecigarette-research.com/web/index.php/research/2014/178-da-ap 




 From what I've seen, HCigar   Tobeco produce lower quality clones. Infinite and ehpro are usually top quality.  




 Prolly pills. Pg is used as a solvent for many types of medication, including Dilantin, an intravenous medication which is 40% pg.  




 Yes, I was advised that memes were against the rules. I corrected and reposted.  




 If the FDA is able to regulate E-cigs because they're considered to Tobacco Products under the Tobacco Control Act of 2009, Couldn't we make electronic cigarettes for the purpose of vaporizing nicotine-free e-liquid only, and just have the user add their own nicotine into the e-liquid?

The Tobacco Control Act defines Tobacco Products to be "any product made or derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption, including any component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product."

This reaches us only because our nicotine is extracted from tobacco.

However, a nicotine-free e-liquid and a vaporizer for such contains no parts derived from tobacco. The FDA would not be able to regulate that, and we will still be able to purchase nicotine from Wizardlabs and mix it in.
 




 Thank you

 What medication? 

Medications work completely differently for each individual person - the results are so strangely different from person to person, that online reviews will almost never be accurate. I feel that you're also right in that people only post with negative opinions.  




 Talk to your doctor about this side effect - it's very common. Buproprion eliminated my appetite completely and I lost a bunch of weight. 

I don't know how you feel about marijuana, but it promotes appetite and is used for said quality.

 Hi friend, 

I've gotten help, so maybe I can be of some use. 

[This site]( http://m.therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/) proved to be a really awesome resource for me. I was super tight on cash, but I was able to sort therapists by the amount of money they require each session, and I found one for only $35 a session. All you have to do is send them an email introducing yourself. 

Before that, I was in the behavioral health section of the hospital for 3 weeks. While it was a very different experience, it's the best thing I've ever had happen to me in my life. It might be something you could consider. 

Getting help is an amazing step. Depression acts like a cloud on our brains, in a way that we often only see things in one light and struggle to see different points of view - we find reasons to bash ourselves and lower our self esteem when in the eyes of a therapist our thought processes are easily seen as false. Talking with someone is a long process. It will take months. However, I found having therapy each week gave me a huge sense of security and control over my life, not including all of the progress I've been able to make with major depressive disorder and severe anxiety (I've graduated therapy - I no longer go). 

NAMI is an organization that meets for free group therapy all over the US, if you are stateside. 

Is there anything you'd like to talk about here?  




 Congratulations, friend. 

It's very strong of you to reach out. That takes pure motivation.  




 Hi friend. 

I've attempted when I was your age. 

I'm now 19. I did not succeed. What I can tell you is this - I've finally come to the point in my life where I am happy to be alive. My entire life in that age was plagued by constant thoughts of suicide. It is now not that way any more. 

If you have school tomorrow, go and do one thing. Tell your best friend that you weren't supposed to be here today. Explain to him or her. It is that point where your life will start to turn around. 

You have a future that you haven't seen yet, and that is the only reason that you feel as if you don't have one. There are so many moments you're going to experience outside of high school that will cause you to reflect for a moment and think, "If I'd have died, I'd never been able to be here right now, and see this." 

Speak to someone, and anyone. If you're making a really big decision like this, learn both sides. Search for ways that you might be able to continue living - to fix your problems. 

High school grades are not permanent by any means. They are highly fixable. If you do care so much about the grades your getting, then you already have the motivation it will take to fix them. 

Think of who you will leave behind. Talk to them, tell them. Be very straightforward. I've lost two best friends to suicide, and I'd just wished they'd have told me straight up that they were thinking of committing. 

You can do this. Contact me here if you need guidance.

Music. 

Vape and caffeine. 

I'll hit up a friend if anyone is willing to listen. Use your resources, they'll be happy that you did - it's not selfish. A lot of times theyre hurting, too. 

I'll treat myself to something small. A nice coffee, candy bar, sushi. This goes for celebration too - remember to celebrate when you've made an accomplishment. My favorite hobby is within electronic cigarettes, so I'll order a new toy to play with every once in a while. 

I'll go for a long drive. 

On the worst days, I'll make a list of anything that is positive about this day, or that I'm thankful for. Start small - if you have arms and legs, put it down. 

Cuddling with kitties is very high on my 
List. 

Until very recently, therapy would give me something to look forward to every week. It gave me a feeling of security. 

In addition, I have a very long list of coping mechanisms - things to do to make it through the day, from the hospital. If you'd like me to pull it out, let me know.

 I've been really struggling all day trying to adb push a file into my phone, specifically /system/media/audio/ui .

My phone is the Verizon Galaxy S4 - VRUFNC5 - 4.4.2 - Running the HyperDrive ROM v19.0.
I rooted via Towelroot, I'm running SafeStrap Recovery, I have SuperSU v2.16, ES File Explorer 3.2.3.1, and Busybox v1.22.1-Stericson

No matter how I try to achieve read/write through adb shell, nothing has been successful. I have also attempted to go into ES File ExplorerRoot ExplorerMount R/W , however this still does not work. This both doesn't enable me to push files into the /ui folder, and while ES Explorer can try to copy files into it, they end up corrupting.
When I say corrupting, I mean that before copying a .ogg file, it will play via the sound player, but after copying/pasting into /ui, it will not play. Trying to "cp" or "busybox cp" the file from the sdcard into /system/media/audio/ui produces the same corrupted result.

Just an example of a code I've tried to enter in adb shell after su: "mount -o rw,remount -t yaffs2 /dev/block/mtdblock03 /system" or "mount -o rw,remount /system/media/audio/ui /system" and/or "chmod 777 system/media/audio/ui"

Can someone please help me out? I've never had this much trouble trying to customize my phone before.

Thank you!  




 I was following /u/nikondork 's great post last night about [taking apart and cleaning an atomizer](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2o3xny/a_quick_guide_for_folks_getting_their_first/), but I made the mistake of starting this process on my only working atomizer at 1:00am last night. 

Since I've rebuilt it, it only reads on my MVP as a dead short. I've taken it apart and tried rebuilding it three times (this is including the positive terminal and all of the insulators).

I'm looking for someone to help me out by posting pictures of how to piece together the atomizer - where the insulators go relative to the brass pin and the positive terminal. I really need to locate the issue in this atomizer, as it is my only vape and I have no money to pay rent much less be able to purchase another atomizer :(.

Edit: I don't quite understand why this was downvoted. I've helped out quite a bit on this subreddit for the last 9 months now - I've participated in every survey, as well as every CASAA Call to Action - yet when I attempt to ask this community to help me be able to vape, I get shot down.

 I'm just having a panic attack. Things have just been building up in my head and I've been trying to find a friend to sit down at talk with for weeks, but no one wants to listen. I don't expect anyone to read this to the end, but I just need to get this shit out of my head.

I've been dreading the coming of this weekend, because it marks one year since I last attempted, and then was brought in to the hospital. I stayed in the lockup for four days, and then stayed in the partial hospitalization program for an additional three weeks. It's been a year, but still I feel that I cannot stop thinking about the time that I spent in there. At night when I'm trying to sleep, I try hard to stop, but I can't stop reliving events that happened when I was in the hospital. I was just so incredibly alone and stripped off all my coping mechanisms that I've never been so broken at any point in my life. For four days I was forced to confront my depression every minute of every day, and the experience was just horrifying for me. I hadn't hurt myself for years before the hospital, but I started again just to be able to cope with being so completely alone.

I remember every sight, smell, every person I grew so attached to that I haven't seen since, every breakdown, every room, doctors, nurses, everything.

I remember my best friend entering my room that night and having her friend carry me into their vehicle, throwing up before I got to the car,  being rushed into the ER, but I don't remember what I was thinking or feeling before I attempted due to what I had taken - which is just scary. 

I remember the first night I got out, I couldn't sleep no matter what I took. I ended up walking out in the blistering cold at 2:30 in the morning just trying so desperately to do anything to get sleep. I took my friend up on an offer for a place to sleep at about 4am, but when I tried to sleep on his couch, I could literally hear the voice of my best friend as if she was standing over me - I heard her asking me why I did this, why I was doing this to myself. 

When I went in to the hospital, it brought an abrupt stop to college that I still haven't recovered from. I was able to fix one grade, but I still have two F's and one C- on my transcript from being in the hospital. This fall is my second semester ever (I took a semester off) and I'm just so absolutely scared that I'm going to repeat my mistakes and never be able to finish college, and that I will never go anywhere with my life.

I lost my job back in July because I was faced with the most horrible anxiety that I've ever felt in my life. I spent so many hours away from my desk locked in the bathroom on the floor losing my mind - completely detached from reality. A lot of it was thanks to the experimental high dosage my medication was increased to - I developed severe paranoia and delusions, thinking everyone at work was out to get me, and I began to hear things that weren't there. A few times I convinced myself falsely that I had forgotten to take my medication, so I took it again, causing me to overdose at work. 600mg of anything is NOT okay. I took so many medications to just get rid of my problem and be able to keep my job, which worked for over a year, but I ended up being in the worst mental and emotional condition of my life. 

Over time I counted out something like 8 different medications I've tried to take, starting at some point during my senior year of highschool, but no matter what I took, I had averse reactions. SSRIs caused me multiple different times to give up every stable thing in my life and attempt suicide. Other types of anti-depressants would cause an increase in anxiety. Benzos caused addiction, even after they caused severe memory loss. Thanks to benzos, I have a decently large chunk of my life that is gone, I just can't remember where I was or what I did. The SNRI I was given in the hospital and took for over half a year was the most addicting drug I've ever put in my body, thanks to its lightning fast half-life.

Fast forwarding to last month, I graduated therapy in a way, because my therapist told me that after I got back into college, all of my conditions improved so much. I had taken the free time between losing my job and starting college to come off of all of my horrible medications, which was the worst withdrawal experience of my life. I was just so happy to be back and I finally felt that I was making something out of my life, and I was doing it without having to give credit to any drug. 

Fast forward to today, I'm completely horrified of falling back into my footsteps of last year and wasting a whole 'nother year of my life by fucking up school. I can feel the depression coming back, and for almost no reason I just have the urge to end my life. I'm broke. I can't make rent, and as of today my bank account is into the negative. I'm applying various places, but I'm so afraid of falling back into the state of severe anxiety. I haven't paid tuition all semester, and I'm afraid that because of this I won't be able to take classes next semester. 

A few months ago, my parents left me, and shortly after that, my best friend - my one and only rock, moved across the country as well. I had been moved out of my parents house for over half a year at that point, and hadn't bothered to go back and spend any time with them until my dog began to pass away. This was due to a lot of relationship problems between me and them - I had a really shitty childhood and teenage years in that house, with a lot of experiences of verbal abuse, neglect, and a couple instances of physical abuse. I didn't expect them to stay around the state just to be ignored by me anyway, but I am still just upset that while everyone I know is still living with their parents and fully supported by them, mine are across the country and I'm all on my own. Tomorrow, my father is having surgery, and I'm horrified of the idea of possibly losing him before I have the chance to amend the problems we've had over the years. 

I just don't know what to do. As soon as I saw the test results from my therapist showing that I had improved, I KNEW things wouldn't stay that way, that I'd just fall down in this hole again and struggle to get out. I didn't really even acknowledge the improvement. I just don't want to be alone at night, get drunk and try to commit again. I'm so scared of going back to the hospital, and I'm so scared of fucking up my grades. I'm so scared that this is the end.

I don't want to follow the path that my friends have. The first friend I ever had as a child committed suicide, less than a year after a close friend of mine was taken over by his disease and committed suicide as well. I know damn well what it does to a family, friends, and a community, but I just can't shake this horrible low I'm feeling. No one around me seems to give a fuck about me anymore, because no matter who I contact to hang out I'm still left sitting alone at home with my thoughts. I feel like I've been surrounded by death and so many horrible relationships.

I don't know what to do to get this shit out of my head. I just want to get through this semester, and return next semester, and keep my life on track. I just want money. I want to be emotionally stable, and I want the full motivation to get there.  









 **TL;DR AT BOTTOM**

On 10/28, I placed an order for an EHPRO Veritas from [Eciggity](http://www.eciggity.com). On 11/1, when I received my Veritas, I discovered that there was moisture inside the plastic packaging it was in, and that the Veritas was [covered in rust](http://imgur.com/a/UAb9N), [as shown in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2kzt7q/what_do_you_do_when_you_unbox_your_vape_and_its/) which did not name the vendor. 

I sent the following message to Eciggity at 8:31am (Hawaii Time, where they are located) on Saturday, 11/1:
Hi,
I just received my EHPRO Veritas today, order #30021, and the whole RDA has rust on it. This IMGUR link is an album containing four pictures of the rust: http://imgur.com/a/UAb9N . This is a first for me, because I've never gotten a vape product this bad before. I would like to return this product. 

At 11:35 Hawaii Time on the same day, I received an email from Eciggity with a pre-paid return label, and another email stating:

Hello test_subject5880, we apologize about that. Please check your e-mail for your return label and send us back your Veritas clone by EHPRO as soon as possible with a brief note of what is wrong with it. We will send you a replacement once we receive confirmation that you have sent it back to us so please let us know when you do so. 

Wednesday Morning, 11/5, I dropped off the Veritas at the post office and at that time Eciggity immediately sent out a new Veritas to me. 

When I unboxed the new Veritas, [it was just as rusty as the one I had first received and sent back to them.](http://imgur.com/a/IdXGb)

The Veritas is contained in a sealed clear plastic bag inside of a paper box. You cannot see from the outside of the bag that there is rust on the RDA, however, after having sent back a Veritas full of rust, I would have expected them to break open the bag and check the RDA. After having seen the EHPRO Veritas, I would be able to distinct it from a Tobeco Veritas, and would not fall victim to them swapping out the product, so why not open the bag? Had it not been in a bag at all and the rust was in more of plain sight, I would have been mad that they weren't checking the products they were sending out to their customers, and would've asked for a refund and purchased from another vendor. Because the rust wasn't in plain sight, I worded my reply email in this way, on Saturday Nov. 8th, 11:58 Hawaii time:

Eciggity, 
I contacted you on 11/1 when I got my EHPRO Veritas in the mail, order #30021 (https://eciggity.zendesk.com/requests/30021), saying that it was shipped full of rust. You processed the return and we exchanged the Veritas, but the replacement I just received today is STILL wet inside the plastic packaging, and full of rust under the top cap. Please take a look at the images and see that it is, in fact, the product I received today, and that it is not usable: http://imgur.com/a/IdXGb 
I would appreciate it if you could determine whether or not every EHPRO Veritas you guys have is full of rust, and if so I will want a full refund. If you can find a product that is rust-free, Im willing to try one more exchange. 

Although I received an email after I contacted them last Saturday, they did not contact me back. I was expecting a reply on Monday, however all of Monday went by and I received nothing. On Tuesday, I received this email:

Hi test_subject5880, 
We apologize for this mishap once again and are unsure of why this has been happened. We will send you another Veritas for exchange. Please use the return label to ship that one back and we will send you another one. This time we will check the product before sending it out, so the product will have already been opened upon arrival. Please include a note indicating reason for return. 
Thank you. 

After sending the second Veritas back to Eciggity today, Wednesday, I received the following email from a different rep. 

Hello test_subject5880, we have received your return for the first Veritas clone by EHPRO that had rust/machine oil built up on the inside of the atomizer. We noticed that the RDA has been used after being cleaned with no rust/machine oil residue traces at all. Our return/exchange policy clearly states that the item being returned/exchanged must be in unused condition to be eligible for any type of return/exchange. However, we went ahead and sent you a replacement Veritas clone by EHPRO anyways assuming that you did not use the RDA due to the rust/machine oil build up inside of it. This is going against our policy and we would like to know if you cleaned and have been using the second replacement Veritas clone by EHPRO we sent you. 

Absolutely enraged, and feeling that they were trying to use semantics to screw me out of my money, but holding back, I responded:

I did not clean or alter the second RDA in any way. All of the components in the box remained in their plastic packaging except for the RDA itself. I removed the top cap, saw rust, and I immediately repackaged the RDA. When it arrives at your shop, it will be in the same condition as I received it in.

.

Thank you for letting us know. We will be waiting for your return. 

.

Will I be receiving a replacement product? 

.

We are currently out of Veritas Clones by EHPRO, but we are expecting to receive more some time next week. We can send you a replacement once we receive them. 

.

That is absolutely NOT okay. I ordered my Veritas on 10/28 and I still have yet to receive a clean product. 
In response to your comment about your return policy, Yes, I did attempt to clean the first EHPRO Veritas, however there absolutely was still rust under the deck's O-Rings that no elbow grease could get out. You can also see, at the bottom of the box, the original O-rings for the RDA, which still have rust on them: http://i.imgur.com/fWlV2qs.jpg . While the RDA was cleaned, I still supplied picture evidence in my first message that the product had rust on it, before cleaning it. I know this wasn't my determination to make, as shown by your return policy, but I don't believe that first product or the second RDA I received could be rightfully sold to any consumer no matter how much rust was scraped off of it. If you want to get into
the details, the description for the RDA also clearly states that it is
"made of all stainless steel." As a consumer, I should be able to
expect that stainless steel will arrive to me free of rust. I will absolutely not wait until next week to have you ship out a product to me that could still be full of rust. I did not receive a working product and I deserve a full refund.

This is absolutely the most frustrating experience I've had with any vendor. **The purpose of this post is not** to convince people to stop using Eciggity as a vendor. This is to document a super-shitty customer experience. I think it is important to document this because, while all companies make mistakes, and this one happened to make about 5, if we start to see another bad experience with the vendor, and then another, we can start to determine as a group that maybe the vendor is not reliable.

###TL;DR

I got a rusty Veritas from Eciggity. They paid for return   second shipping. I sent it back, got another rusty Veritas. I had no response for a couple days. I received another paid shipping label and a promise that they'd check the product this time. After I shipped the second Veritas, I received a rude email from the company saying that I violated the return policy. When asked if I would still receive a replacement, they told me they were fresh out, and I had to wait a week. 









 I've had this friend since my Sophomore year of high school, and I feel differently about her than I've ever felt for any one person in my life. 

She is the only shoulder I've ever had to cry on, and the only person I've ever really been able to always confide in. I have trust issues due to a lot of really bad relationships and losing two of my friends to suicide - I just really don't know who is going to stick around anymore. However, she always has. Whenever I've been at my absolute worst in life, she has always been there to help pick me up. Back in the days of highschool, when I was still living with my parents, when fights would break out in the family, she would ALWAYS show up just to help me escape from the situation. There have been multiple occasions where I've driven to her house and just broke into tears, and she'd be there at any time of night to hold me and calm me down. 

Last year, right before the end of the college semester, things got horribly rough. On a bad night, she came into my room with a friend to carry me to the car and into the ER, and comforted me through the process of being admitted to the behavioral medicine inpatient ward, and she was the first to come and visit.

Now, approximately a year after that experience, she left tonight - moving across the country. I just don't know what to do, because I feel a whole new level of insecurity knowing that if I fall down again, she isn't going to be able to be there. My three weeks in the hospital made me such more of an independent person, but I still **need** that one person in my life to confide in. My parents aren't around anymore, and I don't have family, and while I have other friends, there is just such a level of understanding that is missing, as well as trust that I'm not ready to give.

I just don't know what to do. I was just told by my therapist a couple weeks ago that I made such drastic improvements that I don't have to come to therapy anymore, but I still feel as if I'm falling back into that hole. I'm so scared that I'm going to end up in the hospital again and screw up college again because of it. I would feel like a failure if I wasn't able to complete a semester of college.

What do I do? How do I handle this? My other half is gone and moved on, and I'm so scared. 




 Nicotine Replacement Therapies(NRT's) are products such as nicotine patches, gums, nasal sprays, inhalers, and lozenges.

This is how the FDA defines a tobacco product:

The term "tobacco product" means any product made or derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption, including any component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product. This includes, among other products, cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and smokeless tobacco.

It is my understanding that the nicotine in NRTs is extracted from tobacco plants.

However, I cannot find any information that suggests NRTs are tobacco products.

Electronic Cigarettes contain nicotine extracted from tobacco plants, and by this definition, however, are tobacco products.

What is the difference?

###**TL;DR Does anyone know, preferably with a source included, whether or not NRTs are tobacco products?** 




 Hello again, all!

My first essay posting went way better than expected - [it reached the top three postings on the front page!](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2gq8w4/i_wrote_an_essay_against_rjreynolds_119page/)

I'm now asking for some help finding a topic for my third paper. The paper will be in the format of an "extended definition." **This will take a closer look at defining a term that is ambiguous.**

The paper asks for a closer look at a word, term, phrase, or idea relative to personal vaporizers/electronic cigarettes/vaping that is important for a reader to understand well in order to understand why I support vaping.

**TL;DR**: What is a word relative to vaping that can have more than one meaning, that I could spend a paper prying open the definition for?

**THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH!** 









 Hi all!

[Here is the essay I've just finished!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wq0wrgLyXIkcJ7kXr_DkU4oVPWRZ7Ip1WgtxBCn2-Gw/edit?usp=sharing) It is only 5 pages double spaced, so a light read.

 Hi all,

I'm writing an essay to counter-act parts of RJ Reynold's 119-page submission for banning electronic cigarettes.

RJ Reynold's says, These systems are highly subject to adulteration and tampering, they are manufactured largely overseas in facilities that would, as proposed, fall outside regulatory inspection and oversight, **and many nicotine liquids are sold in non-child-resistant packaging** in flavors that may be appealing to youth.

However, I've never seen a bottle of e-liquid that does not have a childproof cap. 




 Hi all!

I've read bunches of studies on the safety of the four ingredients in e-liquid, but a close friend of mine who I just set up with a starter kit brought a point to my attention that I had never before considered.

I absolutely love menthol flavors, always have. I always remember hearing, however, that menthol cigarettes can cause the crystallization of menthol in the lungs, so while I treated myself to the occasional menthol pack, I always stayed away from camel crush and other super-menthols.

Is this the same with vaping, or even true at all? I believe that the FDA acknowledges menthol mist as safe in throat sprays, and that it's obviously safe to ingest with it being in so many pain relief lozenges, but has anyone seen studies relative to vaping menthol over longer periods of time than one would use a throat spray for? Can this cause harm? 

Any knowledge sharing is much appreciated, and I'd very much appreciate to be pointed in the direction of any studies or experiments that people are aware of. 




 Hello again, all!

While rebuilding my Fogger v4, I've managed to lose two of the screws for the positive and negative posts. Luckily, the Fogger itself came with two extra screws, but should I lose these (I will), I'd like to have a backup so I do not have to punch holes through walls and shake babies.

It was hard enough for me to find replacement glass when I broke mine, and I'm having no luck in finding these tiny little screws. Would anyone care to please help me in my search, and save the lives of children everywhere? 




 Hi again, all!

I'm absolutely in love with my Fogger, but I need some out of the ordinary builds to happen. I'm bored.

The problem is, I don't know how to build a quad coil setup with only two posts. [Here is my last attempt.](http://imgur.com/a/c8WDJ)

The point where the wires cross over in the dead middle of the deck... literally exploded. I measured the resistance and all seemed perfectly well, but when I loaded 'er up onto my Panzer... Boom - the legs glowed white and burst at the contact points.

How do I build a quad coil setup with two posts? 




 Hi, all. Post here if you are an interested seller, and we can PM about the pricing!

 




 Is this legal to do?

 I'm sorry to hear that. [I did as well.](http://i612.photobucket.com/albums/tt206/DrewbtheNewb/Vaping/IMAG0503_zpspvvgiglj.jpg) I searched around on the internet for a replacement only to find that a great amount of vendors are sold out. I did however find two replacement tanks for the Fogger v4 at http://froginfog.com/.

A new glass tank is currently $5.95, while they also sell a metal tank for $8.70. I placed my order for both items on Friday - 6/27/2014, and they arrived at my door on Monday, 7/7/14 (Keep in mind there was a holiday weekend). FrogInFog does offer free shipping. Because I was in a rush, I did request expedited shipping (Domestic Expedited Registered Mail (USPS, UK Royal, Australia Post, etc)) for $4.28.

I was worried that the tanks would be the incorrect dimensions, but I made this post just to reassure buyers that both tanks DO fit and match the original tank exactly.

Here is an image of [all three tanks.](http://i612.photobucket.com/albums/tt206/DrewbtheNewb/Vaping/IMAG0502_zpsxpp2llcp.jpg)

The original is leftmost, the FrogInFog replacement glass in the center, and the FrogInFog replacement metal tank on the right.

I was also amazed that the metal tank fits flawlessly. [Here is an image.](http://i612.photobucket.com/albums/tt206/DrewbtheNewb/Vaping/IMAG0500_zpscgh9eqw3.jpg)

That's all for today, folks! If you have cracked your glass, there is still hope! 




 I had a new vaper come over to my place tonight so I could show him how to rebuild and run him through all the basics. He hopped right into a hybrid Spyrax mod, so needless to say there were a lot of things to run through.

After building with my usual supplies and his juice, we vaped. In the first exhale I took, I could taste something like rubbing alcohol fumes, and I could feel it in my nose. He bought his juice from a new local shop, and it was a 15ml bottle of ~~Mount Baker Vapors Rainbow Roundies~~ (SEE EDIT).

Is this anything to worry about?

EDIT!: The Local vape shop created a label that looks exactly like MBV's labels, but it is instead for their own produced juice, called "Rainbow Candies." I am now concerned that the juice is diluted or dangerous. 




 Every tank I have used so far has had flooding issues. My hands are always sticky, my new Panzer is always sticky, puddles leak out in my pocket and I don't notice until I'm too nicotine buzzed to understand what is going on. My EVOD leaked, my Aerotank leaked, and right now my Fogger V4 is leaking horribly, and I'm just more than put up with it.

The Fogger v4 is an amazing device. It really throws clouds, it was built well, has amazing airflow, and I love it. I just can't get any of my builds to not leak or have bad dry hits. I use organic cotton, and I have tried more cotton, less cotton, cutting all my wicks at 45 degree angles, inserting them into the juice channels and keeping them out of the juice channels, and I just cannot seem to figure it out and master this art.

###What I'm looking for 
is for my much loved fellow brother and sister ECR members to advise me of any device that will never flood, or they have at least had extremely minimal floods on. At this point, my next purchase will be anything that is guaranteed to not flood out of the air holes.

I'm also looking for any tips for RBA building, whether they are on the Fogger V4 or not, that would help me minimize my flooding issues and still be able to chain-vape (or at least take long draws) with no dry hits.

Please advise, I am very frustrated. 




 In my time on ECR, I have seen a lot of people with problems relative to their Kanger Aerotanks. I bought the Kanger Aerotank in January of this year shortly after it was released. It is in my opinion the most frustrating and horribly designed piece of metal I have ever bought.


The culprit of the issue is the [three piece airflow base for the Aerotank](http://imgur.com/a/R00zT). It is not made of the same stainless steel, it is instead a cheaper, bendable metal. The three pieces are as follows: The rotating airflow control ring, and the two metal pieces that hold it - one of which screws into the tank, one which holds the floating terminal and screws onto the battery.

The two bendable metal pieces which contain the rotating airflow do not have threads to hold them together. They are instead pressed together. The problem this causes is the slow but constant gap that forms between these two pieces - which causes the coil terminal to be unable to contact the battery terminal.

If you are really confused as to why your Aerotank is not vaping, and you keep throwing new coils into the tank, and keep screwing it onto different batteries, this is why this is happening. 

Along with the fact that the Kangertech dual coil designs flood like hurricanes without rewicking, in my time of owning the Aerotank and it being my only upgrade tank back then, I spent 75% of my time trying to get my Aerotank to work and 25% of the time getting as good of a vape as I did on my EVOD. It came to the point where I had to press down on my tank and get it to bend just at the right angle every drag in order to be able to vape out of it. When that didn't work (it commonly didn't), I had to take apart the tank completely and press the coil towards the battery in order to get it to contact for a good 15 minutes. While vaping and driving, whenever I shifted with the tank in my hand, the tank flew across the car, and the airflow control ring went missing.

I have since then given up on the Aerotank and I'm not even able to use it as a backup tank, but I really want to get this out there so people don't have to have the same struggles as I did. Kanger has a great product line, and the EVOD is the best way to start vaping, but if you are going to go Aerotank, at least try the Aerotank Megas. 




 I'm trying to get the max potential I possibly can out of my MVP 2.0 and my Fogger v4. The problem is that while rebuilding dual coils on any device with the MVP, is that they heat up HORRIBLY slow - my 10 second limiter kicks in right when they finally get heated.

When talking about the best resistance range for the MVP due to the limits it has, /u/Fortinbraz said

anywhere between 1.2 (where you would hit the device's amp limit) and 2.3 (where you would hit the devices voltage limit), you are good to go up to 11W.

The problem is that when I get even close to dual coils at 1.2 ohms with 30 gauge kanthal, I'm running two coils with 2.4 ohms resistance and they heat horribly slow.

What is the highest power build I can run on my MVP 2.0? 




 I just got the Fogger V4 in today! I built a couple of coils, and now I'm just trying to figure out how to secure them to the posts. This is my first official RBA build, although I've been rebuilding non-stop for the Kanger Aerotank for some weeks now.

I'm looking for any easy way or tips as to how to get these coils secured to the two posts! Thank you! 




 I wanted to buy the version from [Eciggity](http://www.eciggity.com/fogger-v4/), but to me they appear to be sold out?

I understand that there are three different versions of the Fogger V4, and I'm looking for the latest. Where is the best place to find this? Can I purchase an authentic or are they all clones?

I spilled a few drops of Mountain Dew in my eye yesterday, and it burned like hell, but I was able to wick it away with my t-shirt. It didn't hurt too much until last night while I was drinking, lights became quite a bit of an eyesore. In the shower this morning it felt like I had an eyelash sticking into my eye, so I twisted my eyelashes in a towel and everything felt fine. Now it's just sore as all hell, and I pulled my eyelid back just to investigate, and I was like OMFG what the hell is that. Any assistance on this topic would be greatly appreciated.

 I've been recently rebuilding my Kanger Aerotank coils, and I'm looking to move to the next step with my MVP 2.

I've been lurking for quite some time, and I see that the Kayfun is highly recommended for starting rebuilding. It is also made obvious that I want to go the route of purchasing a clone of the Kayfun. I have my eyes on the following by ehpro: http://101vape.com/rebuildable-atomizers-tanks/295-kayfun-lite-plus-clone-v2-by-ehpro.html

I have seen that the top recommended Kayfun clone is by tobeco, however?

OVERALL, I'd really appreciate some guidance as to what and where I should purchase to get into the art of rebuilding and achieve a heavy vape. Thank you, ECR3 




 I've made this mistake about four or five times now.

I go into the work bathroom to clean a flood out of my vape, or I'm simply near/on the toilet vaping and I take apart my vape to add e-liquid, when my whole world comes to an end. I drop one of the four items I am juggling, and I hear a horid splash followed by a solid CLINK. A piece of my vape has now entered the toilet realm.

I try and I try again to not let pieces of my vaporizers fall into the toilet. I even took everything apart in a cabinet in the stall not above the toilet, but that wasn't enough. I knocked over my tank, it bounced off the floor twice, and committed suic1de with the help of some angry devilish force giving it enough inertia to fling itself into the toilet.

The worst is when this happens in the morning at work, and I absolutely know I will be fucked for the rest of the day.

Does this happen to anyone else?
Why does this have to happen to anyone to begin with.
What a cruel, cruel world we live in. 









 I've been vaping for about 7 and a half months. Moreso recently, juices have been really making it hard to breathe, and even harder to enjoy vaping. My nose isn't congested, it's just impossible to breathe through, and my airway in my throat tightens a bit at times. A 50/50 and 60/40 blend both cause the problems equally. These juices are both created by Vape Dojo. I bought juices elsewhere, and the problem seems to be a lot easier to deal with, but it's still there. I've heard about PG intolerance, but I don't know if this is a regular symptom of that or not. The main culprit is a juice called Zen Juice (fruity menthol), which was my first juice ever and I used to LOVE it, but now I can't vape it. Wtf? 




 I'm looking to automate the creation of sticker labels that will be on the bottom of files. This link is a prototype created in photoshop. http://i.imgur.com/kMlrNEY.png

These labels are 8" long and 1 7/16(1.438)" high, and will fold in half over the bottom of the file. On the left in separate images are the first three letters of the last name (I have created a library of letter images using photoshop). These letters are 3/4" wide. On the right is another imported photo, the type of file (1/2" wide). I will create a library of these images as well.

I have created a class in java that uses GUI to solicit data from the user (Prefix, First name, last name, Suffix, Account number, loan type).

What would be the best way to automate the creation of these labels using the user-inputted data? I will then need to print these created images using a regular color printer on label paper (I'm not too worried about the printing process). This project is time sensitive, so I very very much appreciate any help! Thank you  much love!

 I had just moved in, living with a friend of mine and his family. Me and my friend both shared a room, with me on top bunk and him on the bottom,  and I made a point to screw with him every now and then. My friend was out for the night, not going to return until late, and I knew that he was out smoking and would come back home still super high, as he had done the last couple nights before. 

I took some of his clothes, put them in his bed, and filled them with rolled up towels, ie pajama pants with rolled up towel legs with a bit of towel sticking out the bottoms - just enough to place socks on the end. I used a backpack to imitate the size of a torso, towels as arms, and a snowboarding helmet as a head. 
http://imgur.com/rs7FaPM

I then covered the fake person in his bed with the blanket, leaving the feet sticking out, making it look like a person was passed out in his bed face down. 
http://imgur.com/oO0w7Xo ,   http://imgur.com/EAXeEWG

Fast forwarding, I'm up on the top bunk and I hear his car pull in. He heads up to his room, turns the lights on, and just stares in disbelief at his bed for several minutes straight. He doesn't move, just stares, trying to comprehend what the hell is going on, why there are no extra cars in the driveway, so who is passed out on the bottom bunk? Eventually he just couldn't handle it. He turns the lights off and walks out. I then hear a car door close, engine start, garage door open, followed by him just noping the fuck out and leaving to go sleep somewhere else.

 Not so much insight, just lots of experience with it working on the fogger. The screws naturally rise out a bit by themselves in the fogger, and screwing them down tight keeps the resistance low, however if I want an ohm or two higher, I'll keep one of the screws slightly less tight.  




 There are two resources I can't recommend enough.

I've also had this same struggle of a wonky sleep schedule due to depression, and the inability to gather thoughts due to anxiety. I always feel like I'm sad as hell, but don't know exactly what or how to talk about it. Going to sessions again and again makes it easier and easier to collect thoughts - it's hard and I feel like it's almost something that takes practice. 

Best of luck, friend.

 I'd say to feel free to make your own thread asking this question. This shouldn't be limited to a reddit breaking "daily questions" thread. 

Just about everyone starts smoking underage, they just stay quiet about it. Vape at whatever age you want to if it is the only way you can quit smoking.  




 I've got the opposite advice of tropical walrus. If your atomizer has fallen below 1 ohm, you might be able to unscrew the screws just a tiny bit to increase the resistance. Else, my friend with an istick just unscrews the atomizer from the istick just a tiny bit and it increases the resistance - this is with a nautilus, however. 

Also, your MVP will fire anything greater than 0.7 ohms. The istick fires anything equal to or greater than 1 ohm.  




 This. 

Or the insulator around the 510 pin is twisted and not preventing the positive current from running into the negative current, causing a short. 

[here's the piece were talking about.] (http://imgur.com/SWjxuq2) The pin that contacts the bottom of the atomizer, and the white ring insulator around it. Mine is very dried out and crapping out as well.  




 You'll most likely have to buy a new one (or figure out how to replace it). I thing the general idea around this subreddit is that batteries usually last a year or more until they start to decline. 




 Most of the time, I think, the vendors who give the product prototype to the reviewer usually make a lot of the changes in the prototype that the reviewer recommends, so the final product has a good chance of not having a cheap rattling button.

 I would learn to overcome my fear of water brought on by the drowning of my father by sneaking into a large sailboat and sailing into the open ocean, where I'm met with a horrible sadistic storm that is ever increasing in intensity. As a response I tie myself to the ship and scream at the sky, accepting my death, until the storm eventually passes, I dry off, and suddenly crash my boat into the edge of the world as I know it. The head of my boat cracks through a wall painted to look like a skyline, and I immediately notice a set of painted stairs leading up the painted wall. As the set of stairs leads me to a door which reads "exit", I meet my real father who lives in the moon, and offers me a life encompassing ultimatum: Either I stay with him and continue to live in a world where everyone is watching me, or I venture into the open world. In response to his ultimatum, I open the door reading "exit", after saying

"Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!"

Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, kiddo. 




 That smirk at the end says,  "I'm about to fuck up your whole day."  




 If we were to go fuck up North Korea and export some freedom to their front door, I think I'd join the war effort.  




 Interesting! Thanks for reminding me. I've been out of Spanish class for a while :)  




 Doesn't Caliente mean spicy? And Bonita/guapo refers to looks?  




 Got into my account. I don't know if it was a matter of the services being back online or what I did, but I'll share how I got into the account just in case it's a solution.

Started up CoD Advanced Warfare signed into a different account on the Xbox. Notification said Press whatever button (Select on the 360) to switch profiles. Did so. Put in password. Viola.  




 Wtf. [Is China raping us right now?](http://imgur.com/Mwj0N7w) 




 Question.

I'm trying to play single player via Xbox One, however my account requires a password in order to sign in. On the 360 you could just unplug the ethernet cable to sign in without a password. Is there an equivalent on the Xbox One? 




 You too!  




 I didn't. It was only an issue with one bottle and I didn't see fit to complain about it. Thank you, though!  




 I really loved this community when I first joined around 10 months ago. 




 30+mg? That sounds like flavor hell - nicotine really dulls down flavor.

Have you considered that having a higher power device allows you to drop nicotine levels because you're producing more vapor in each hit? 




 Great company with nice customer service in my opinion.

My last order was from them on 10/2/14. I ordered GWAR Bloodbath and a refill on Hawk Sauce. The Hawk Sauce I got was pretty different than usual   bad - it tasted like 50%Hawk Sauce and 50%Thug Juice. The Bloodbath was absolutely incredible, though. 




 Anything single coil. The mvp won't power dual coils well.  




 Laugh.  




 Yeah fucking right. A small country full of giant babies. Take them out.  




 The 




 Sounds like me

Except the events were all true, and I'm a man. I had like the worst luck in the world getting to work, cars constantly breaking down no matter which one I drove,  my favorite dog passing away, landed in the hospital for breakdowns, storming out because I hated my job, etc. 

Girl most likely had a severe anxiety disorder  




 Thank you so very much!! Your words are very motivating and helpful! Thank you so much for commenting. I will remember that I can stop and relax every once in a while  :) 

Also, congratulations on your trip!  




 There's a fine line between the amount of long distance driving that calms my nerves, and the amount that has me horribly on edge. 

Driving long distance is horribly anxiety provoking for me, and I've been dreading this trip for the past month or so now. 

I have this irrational fear of my own fear, that I'll panic, lose contact with reality, lock up in traffic and crash, and crashing somewhere completely unknown frightens me.

 These last couple of months I've actually experienced what I'm telling myself is a new symptom of anxiety - having trouble breathing. I've experienced a whole bucket of symptoms, but never this common one. These last few days (it's horrible right now), I've been having to yawn or try to inhale as deeply as possible to scoop a deep breath out of myself, because I feel as if there is something in my upper chest/bronchi preventing me from taking a deep breath. This adds to my fear, because I of course have that part of my brain which is convinced it's always cancer, and I'm worried about suddenly not being able to breath halfway through my trip. 

I also have the worst of luck with cars, and I'm also naturally scared of breaking down somewhere and spending Christmas somewhere halfway between my starting point and destination. 

Thank you for reading -  any words of encouragement are greatly appreciated! I've struggled for some years and seen treatment both from a hospital environment and one on one therapy, however reminders and support will be much appreciated.

 They also fucked with the College, hard. 

That shit don't fly. Not in my College.  




 Oh man. He was my most hated in the game. I really enjoyed taking his life.  




 Fuck off  




 Favorite thing: destruction magic

Favorite person: Jzargo! Been my follower since the beginning. 

The Sands are cold, but Khajit feels warmness from your presence.  




 Too dark, man 




 More airflow   faster wicking keeps it from reaching the same temperature. 




 Been there a couple of times with this girl and then that girl. Somehow I think that they probably see this type of thing all the time.  




 Is this actually a real thing?  




 Thank you. That might make more sense, then. Sadly, I'm probably the 1% of reddit that doesn't care about that movie right now. I've seen all the TV commercials for the last month every day, but never any official trailers.

 Google his username or put it into pipl.com 




 Agreed. [What a strange coincidence.] ( http://imgur.com/quGv59Z)  




 Acoustic version of firework? Really?  




 I guess that's one way to treat a smelly snatch.  




 Interesting! I was not aware that this was the case. I'll be fighting the regulation as always.  




 It's whatever, I guess. I don't like the idea of a daily questions thread and I'm not going to abide by it, but whatever.
