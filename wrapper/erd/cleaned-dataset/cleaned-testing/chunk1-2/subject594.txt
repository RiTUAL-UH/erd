 Well, statistically it is not as bad as you think it is.  Here is my very specific example: I used to live in Louisa County, Iowa which is in Tornado Alley.  There was one time in the 14 years I was there that several tornados came through.  0 fatalities.  Here is the hard data: http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/Iowa/Louisa/table  




 The assistant principal at my high school outlawed purses on the basis that carrying them was sexist against boys (although there was no rule that they couldn't.... they would just have to put up with harassment from their male peers....).  So my sister and her friends threaded a string through tampon boxes and wore them as purses while they dragged their car keys behind them on another string.  Believe it or not, the rule against purses stopped being enforced.  This is some cheek, I can't believe it worked.  Back in my day, I just carried a billfold that constantly fell out of my inadequate female pockets.  




 A toad.  I was camping and I saw this toad hopping towards the fire pit.  I fished him out as quick as I could but his back legs were all melted and he was chirping.  I set him down and stomped him as hard as I could as an act of mercy.  I still feel guilty.  




 If you wrap your warm soda can in a wet paper towel before you put it in the freezer for 20 minutes, it will be consistently cold rather than that kind-of sort-of cold you get normally.  (Always set a timer on your phone when putting sodas in the freezer, dear ones.) 




 Sorry for being redundant! :) 




 I'm sincere but not serious whenever I joke around with my dementia patients in Hospice.  Obviously dementia is not funny, but when we laugh together, it's not so scary for a moment.  




 This isn't exactly what you're asking, but I think it's pretty funny in retrospect.  My ex-boyfriend let his mother think I took his v-card, so she was pretty much awful to me (the son thief who turned him on to premarital sex).... I'm not sure what she thinks he was doing at college for three years.   




 TROLL ALERT.... LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THIS IS NOT A DRILL.  WE HAVE A TROLL. 

Edit: This is very ironic... So many people upset about how feminists don't call out extremists in their own group, and yet I'm getting downvoted.  Oh, Reddit, do you really know what you want?  




 Right, I don't claim to have all the answers.  What I took issue with is the statement (that you did not make) that women only claim feminism when it benefits them.  I don't believe this to be the case.  A lot of "feminist issues" are merely human issues, and, indeed, a lot of men's issues happen to be feminist issues.  You offered an example of when women failed to pull the feminist card so to speak.  I refuted it with a very specific example.  I am not a feminist when it is convenient.  I help where I can.   




 Well, you're setting a great example for how to take another road.  I'm not on the same page as you are, but you made me stop and examine what it is I believe, and that is a beautiful thing.  Thank you for being respectful and for taking the time to try to enlighten people.  I appreciate you.  




 I am so sorry for what I'm about to say here, because it's not something that can be proven, it is merely anecdotal, but any man who thinks that a girl need only cry "rape" and ruin his life has very little first hand experience with how things actually work.  I'm sorry to say that when my best friend went to our FEMALE HR director because her boss sent her unsolicited messages on Facebook about his sex dreams about her (he being married and twice her age), her exact words to my male boss was "There was something more going on there, she was pursuing him, I'd bet my life." She was pursuing an overweight, bald man with a wife and three children.  She was asking to be put in a situation where she had no idea what to do and agonized over whether to get help for over a month.  She was forced to remain under this man for almost a year until she was promoted beyond him.  She wasn't raped.  This isn't comparable to a rape.  But think about Brandon Teena.  A female to male transgender person who was raped by two men.  Look into how successful he was when he tried to get help. 




 This was sheer brilliance.  




 Edit: Sorry, I thought I was talking to the same person the whole time here.

Shutupharu: I'm glad you're giving me a chance to explain.  Direct combat wasn't something that women were allowed into without fighting for that right.  It's a job with a high probability of fatalities and we fought to do it. :)

Monty 845: I don't think that what you're suggesting is altogether reasonable, you see, I don't want to put my life in peril, but I'm quite sure that if I did, I could apply for a job on an oil rig.  However, I'm sure I wouldn't be physically capable of doing the job.  Do I think that the job should be made easier for me?  Absolutely not.  Full disclosure: I would rather be carried out of a burning building than dragged out by a woman, BUT do I think that a woman shouldn't be turned away without giving her a chance to prove herself?  Absolutely.  You see?  We're not all crazy.  




 I think it is very admirable that you can view a terrible experience as a positive lesson.  I'm also glad that you were able to come to terms with your rape.  I'm sure you're a vibrant and interesting person who deserves to be happy.  Thank you for existing.  




 I know you're not going to do this, but I encourage you to look into sexual assault statistics for the U.S. Armed Forces, and then to remember that until very recently, all assaults were to be reported to your direct commanding officer (you know, the person that would be reprimanded for that kind of behavior going on within their contingent).  Before I get accused of being callous of assaults on men, I'm absolutely not.  It breaks my heart that so many of them suffer in silence thanks to the idea that one of the worst things you can be in this society is "a little bitch." 




 I'm sorry that that happened to you.  Truly.  




 I am now going to systematically upvote all your comments everywhere to show my sisterly support of you.  Yes really.  Don't thank me, it's not about me.  It's about you.  I only wish I could do more.  




 Very eloquently put. I dislike the misconception that feminist issues only affect women positively.  Men are nearly twice as likely to commit suicide and that has not a little to do with the myths that men are not allowed to be anything other than hyper-masculine.  I've never seen a feminist cheer when they read a story about a young man being raped by an adult women, that's a feminist issue too.  I sincerely hope that your optimism is borne out.  Thank you for your thoughtful and brave response.  




 Can I just say I like your swagger?  I'm crying out of one eye now. 




 Put the bunneh back in the bahx.  




 Con Air.  SOOOO GOOOD SOOOO BAD. 




 "Mind your p's and q's" is actually supposed to mean "Mind your pints and quarts," meaning don't get drunk and pick fights with people.  Most folks think it means "Be polite." 




 His heart is in the right place.

 Go outside... Chew some gum... walk as fast as you can while you chew the gum.  I bet your rage doesn't last ten minutes.  This works for heading off a panic attack too.  




 If you get one from me, I either agree with what you're saying, find you well spoken, was entertained, or appreciate your support.  Getting one seems 100% random.  You never know what redditors will like, it seems.  




 What are the Basement Jaxx for 300?  




 "I'm sorry that no one has responded to this question yet. I don't exactly fit the bill for what you're asking, but I am a volunteer who spends about six hours a week as a companion in Hospice. In our training, we are taught to encourage whatever the person is feeling. If they are angry, yeah! You be angry! If they are sad, we are to cry with them. If they can't really communicate, we're to hold their hand and just let them know we're here and we care. We had a speaker come in and share that the four most important things we can say to someone who is dying are "I love you," "Thank you," "I'm sorry," and "I forgive you." This dovetails nicely with what you're asking. The best way to come to terms with your own death is to live a life where if you were killed tomorrow, you wouldn't wish you had said any of these things. Don't wait. Just be brave and live." 




 Reading an interview with Billy Corgran without making this face: :-/ 




 I upvoted this, but I think you mean staying happily married to someone who is famous.  Why do they even bother getting married?  What is the point, I ask?  




 The pages of a book! Nothing better. :) 




 I think that the one thing about it that really got to me was the rage in the rebuttal against people saying they care about the health of people they don't know personally.  I think that all life is precious, and my anxiety tends to focus on death a lot.  One of the ways I struggle is when people don't hide their internal machinery well.  Just as I get nervous around people who work out too much and wear their veins sticking out, I get nervous around obese people because eating is the ultimate proof of mortality.  If you get hungry, you are going to die and that is very sad.  Is it such a bad thing to not want people you know personally to die?  Why wouldn't you believe that I care?  The heart is such an uncomfortable concept even in a healthy person, but the fact that I knew a person who was so morbidly obese their heart failed trying to beat against the back of his ribcage is terrifying for me.  I don't want that for anyone.  (I'm sorry, I know this was 100% weird, but it was also serious.)  




 Read.  Reading makes you more emphatic, thoughtful, introspective, knowledgable, and kind.  If you simply can't go out and experience things first hand, you can always read about them until you get to that point.   




 That divorce is a sad thing.  For example, Neil Young and Peggi Young getting divorced after 30 years of marriage.  At first I was like how sad, but now I'm like, you know, Peggi is nearly 70, Neil is obviously cranky (yes brilliant, but c'mon you know he is cranky as fuck), good for her! Go be free!  See new people and do what you want!  GO!  




 Saxondale. 




 If you aren't selected for trial, you're on call for two weeks. Hope this helps!  




 Almost every piece that was featured in the Granta issue "Betrayal" has stuck with me.  It forced me to think about a lot of really uncomfortable things.   




 I used to have these super graphic violent dreams about animals.  The worst one starts with me coming out of a stall in a mall restroom and there was this overweight lady torturing a dachshund with a taser.  I left the restroom and there where these people all crowded together in a circle.  When I pushed my way in, I saw that they were trying to tear this toucan apart with their hands.  The toucan was jerking his head and making this clicking noise in his throat and he had a tear coming out of one of his eyes.  It fucked me up for a very long time. I can still hear that clicking sound.    




 Lots of people dip their jelly toast points into a fried egg.  I just make a fried egg and jelly toast sandwich.  




 Jeremiah Johnson 




 I don't know about best ever, period, the end, but the best acted scene I've ever seen is Robert Redford at the end of Jeremiah Johnson when Bear Claw observes that the "Winters run long up here."  The sheer amount of pain that man managed to get into a "Yeah," it fucking rends my heart every time.  BRAVO REDFORD, Bra-VO. 




 This doesn't ruin my day, but it annoys the fuck out of me: If the CEO's phone rings three times with no answer, it rolls to me.  People will wait until it rolls to me and then hang up.  This leaves a stupid missed call icon on my phone that I can only get rid of by calling them back.  




 You click your username and then pick the downvoted tab. 




 I don't think so.  Here is why: I once encountered a boy who was not very solicitous or interesting or funny or even a good sport.  He was not conventionally attractive, in fact he was a bit overweight and kind of looked like a penguin.  But when I would sit down next to him, I would get hyper, mega turned on.  I couldn't sleep next to him, I was too aroused.  It had to be pheromones.  I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he had no similar reaction to me.  I think the real question is how much of any of this had to do with the fact that I'd been on hormonal birth control for five years at that point.     




 Too cold to snow.  




 The question was "Something that sounded great in theory and was fucking terrible in practice." My response was breastfeeding.  Apparently the plight of new mothers is extremely unpopular.   




 I just checked the parent company's website and the only thing we're looking for is in Hartford for an engineer.... I pulled up a lot of results by just looking for "call center CT" in Google, I'd do that since I don't know specifically what city you're in. :) 




 I used to work for an outsourcing call center (this isn't telemarketing, it's mostly utility company customer service), and I can tell you that call centers offer an awful lot of upward mobility.  My former boss only had a GED and he's making well over $60k a year as the call center manager.  He started as an agent on the phones.  I was there for five years, was promoted four times, and was making $20.18/hr when I left.  I wish you good luck, sir! :)

Edit: I should say "Call Center Manager" is a title. It sounds like he was just a general type manager reading it again... He wasn't, he over saw the team of 12 major supervisors and all of their team leads, who were responsible for 300+ employees under them.  He ran the whole center and sometimes more than one location. I figured I should clarify. :) 




 How would I know? I'm an American!  Good job, media ban! :) 




 The 9 times tables.  Or any other times table come to that.  




 He made a blog for the sole purpose of complaining about me, describing our break-up as "harrowing."  I promise I didn't try to push him off a cliff.  




 No! Who the hell is Russel Williams?  If he's under a media ban, it's working!  




 Hey, thank you!  I'm not, but I like to write them occasionally.  I'm also fond of this one, although it is not on topic : Cactus in sweater / Never to be cold again / in the starry night 

or how about this one about how my mom hates carnies? : Sticky hand pulls me / seeds rattle in sweaty cup / do not talk to them

Obviously I don't take myself very seriously, but my post was supposed to be about how the world calls to you and your family calls to you and you need to remember you belong to both. :) 




 I'm with you.  I steadfastly believe that folks who don't like eggplant don't know you're supposed to press them.  They're amazing!   




 I have seen them all, and I don't like any of them.  Apart from uniformly suffering from pacing issues, he just can't seem to help himself when it comes to cheeky jokes within his films.  He just seems so damn pleased with himself!  Also, three of his most famous films completely missed the point of the reference material thanks to his casting choices.  That is very upsetting to me.  




 Oh, ANYTHING by Stanley Kubrick.  




 Stars bright over house / Warm light from inside places / They shine for you too 




 How about the most awkward thing I do on a consistent basis?  If you text me and I don't want to talk to you or wish you didn't have my number, I'll respond with "Who is this?" 




 I'm going to be telling people about this side-quest where I gain a severed arm as a weapon for the rest of my life.  So far, it's been true.  I'm doing it now.  HagtagGimblesProsthetics.  




 If by best you mean so bad it's almost good, probably the date-rape montage in Dahmer which featured "More, More, More," as the soundtrack.  




 Saxondale. 




 For me, it is explaining something totally implausible by throwing in that there was another dimension at the last possible moment.  I'm looking at you, Clive Barker.  




 I'm not really sure what you're looking for from me since our experiences are very, very different.  I can't go back in a time machine and make my interactions as a person working for a Fortune 500 subsidiary that happened to use a temp agency any different from what they are.  Our entry level employees are paid $8.50 when they hit the door.  We pay $16.50 an hour to the temp agency for people who temp in those same positions.  Obviously if we can buy out their contract, it's better to do so as soon as possible.  We have to pay that hourly fee while we train them, a time when they are not generating any profit for our company.  I'm sorry you feel you need to argue with me, but maybe the area we live in plays a factor here.   




 Just look up Luke Magnotta on Wikipedia.  I was serious.  




 While I appreciate that you have a very strong opinion that is likely rooted in experience, it happens to be at odds with what I've seen.  It's definitely true that places are not obligated to hire on a temp, they're paying a premium for  your work and have already had to eat training costs.  You'd be a much better candidate than a person off the street would be, having come from a temp agency for that reason alone.   




 1 lunatic 1 icepick is totally real.  




 100%, although after Stephen Collins, I'm seriously worried it's going to be the next equality frontier.  I can just hear it now.... "I was born this way..." "I don't actually harm children...." 




 It was yesterday.  I asked for help in building a set-up to play vinyl records within my specific budget.  I'm happy to say I put in an order that night.  Thanks, Reddit!  




 I am a big advocate of researching cooking techniques before you start, but if it's too late for that, use a cooking thermometer.  Safe internal temps are different for each kind of product.  :) 

If you don't have one, as a last resort, pick a really thick item you've cooked, cut into it.  If the juice is clear instead of red, you're good.  




 My advice is actually to sign on with a temp company.  Temp companies are used to extremely high employee turnover, so they tend to skip doing background checks.  Because a temp agency is supposed to run a background check, the company you are matched with will likely not do one.  This is how my former company ended up with several level 1 sex offenders on the payroll.  Let my disturbing experience be your boon!  Best of luck to you... It's awesome that you're so driven. :) 




 I think a better question is why is Neil Young still Canadian when he's lived in California the vast majority of his life?  Can you answer this OP?  I'm dead serious.   




 I know that you guys do media freezes for atrocious crimes.  The average American has no idea who Paul Bernardo is, and definitely have never heard of Luke Magnotta, which is crazy when you think about it.  




 Thanks for being a good sport. ;-)

 I love it when a man isn't afraid of asking about things he doesn't understand.  Wanting to learn is very sexy and it connotes that you understand that seeking knowledge is always more important than saving face.  If you don't know what "loquacious" means, ask me! I would love to explain it to you. :) 




 I like your style. 




 I actually don't care, so long as it isn't what it is.  Before and after I'm married, my name is unique to the entire planet (or at least folks searchable on the internet), meaning if you know my damn name, you can find me.  This has happened. 




 I thought of a good one... My mom once said to my cousin Jason that he could go into the basement and have Hot Sex with Grandma.  She was down in the basement drinking Hot Sex which I think is sort of like Bailey's.  He turned so red you could've fried an egg on his head.  




 Hardcore Pawn.  (Which in no way stops me from watching it.) 




 Well, I wish I could agree with you, but American Tabloid was the last straw for me.  These days, I'd take a good Southern Gothic over any gumshoe story.  Thanks for the banter! :)  




 Since you mentioned Black Dahlia.... Teddy bears with locks of children's hair taped between their legs? 




 You start knitting and wait for her to approach you because you're that interesting guy who isn't afraid to knit. 




 Start knitting.  Go to your local yarn shop and knit.  Blog about knitting.  You will not believe how many cute girls knit these days.  I follow 15 boy knitters on Tumblr just because they are boys who knit. None of them happen to like girls, but you see.... there's a niche here.  You only need google "Ryan Gosling knitting" to see what the hell I'm talking about. 




 In this blog, he described our break-up as "harrowing."  I mean, at that moment, part of me was like "Don't be so dramatic," but part of me was like "Yesss, he thinks I am Liam Neeson."  




 I'm walking to a meeting I'm already late for.  I have to present at the meeting, but I'm not prepared and it involves math.  I'm stuck behind someone who is walking very slowly.  They are wearing flip-flops that they are dragging across the floor.  They are also whistling.  While all of this is happening, I'm wearing pantyhose and an ill-fitting outfit.  It's 90 degrees inside with 60% humidity.  




 How has no one said eggnog?  If you drink a whole carton of eggnog, you will regret it with your body and your soul.  Just ask my husband.  




 A subscription to Granta.  Every issue challenges me to think about things I never have before and to examine my reactions closely.  




 Almost anything for your infant. Almost.  




 I went back and looked at every letter and e-mail and chat history and birthday card I ever exchanged with him.  Looking at everything in order as a cohesive progression allowed me to come to conclusions I had avoided before.  By the time I was done, I realized I never wanted to be with him at all, I just wanted to be him.  I felt that he was what I could be if I weren't afraid.  He was me without limits.  




 I'm a woman, and my contribution is slipping into a hot bath when you're really cold.  




 Me and the unsightly callous on my right ring finger approve of your contribution.  




 Anything where people employ aggressive upselling.  Cable, insurance, funeral services. 




 Backstory aside, let me tell you for future reference, that yes, a teenage girl could absolutely get pregnant the day before her period.  A woman's cycle especially when she is young, can be far from consistent.  There is a possibility that it's not a period at all but implantation spotting.  You should be practicing safe sex if you don't want to impregnant someone.  It's as simple as that.  




 Red Velvet Oreos. 




 That is so rude, outting me like that!  




 Dr. Pepper.... Did you know that Dr. Pepper is actually owned cooperatively by Pepsi and Coke?  Read about the Soda Wars of the 90's.  Fascinating stuff.  




 I would think since I'm 105 lbs and a C-cup you would be like, o bby, bring your neurosis over here.  Tell me more about how you like to count things.  




 All of our survival instincts are suddenly not allowed.  You can't run away.  As a female, I find police to be terrifying.  









 Hello;
Does anyone know off hand why the Pro-Ject is a better choice and thus higher price than the TEAC? 
Thank you for your help! :)  




 Hello; I'm looking to buy a full set up for about $800, with a bit of wiggle room.  Can you please suggest what would be the best use of my money?  Thank you... this is way overwhelming!  
























 There are a lot of little tricks you can use to help you feel better when you are depressed.  Set a small attainable goal for yourself.  Like baking a cake from scratch.  Focus on researching the perfect recipe, focus on going out and getting the ingredients, measure and check for advice on good techniques.  You make that cake.  You eat some of that cake.  Think of your next challenge.

The best friend of depression is inactivity.  We feel tired and so we think what we want is to lie down and not think, but we just feel sick at the end of the day.  And we think, and think and think.  If you focus on doing something, any little thing, you can get out of your head.  If you can't manage to do it for yourself, read.  Read a novel.  Be someone else.     




 My advice is to:

Travel (See this world that holds no charms for you!)

Volunteer (Do things out of the goodness of your own heart with no selfish motives.)

Make goals for yourself (See it as a challenge, play a game with yourself.  You seem pretty bright to me, or at the very least well-written... how far can that take you?  Can you trick someone into giving you a job you're not qualified for?  Can you write a novel?  Can you learn to cook a perfect macaron?)

MOVE.  (For the love of god, don't lie on the couch or sit in front of your computer all day.  Go out, go out in public.  People watch, laugh, see the sights, move your body.)

The world really is a beautiful, strange place.  We only get to live in it one time and there is a good chance that there is nothing after.  Try to reach inside and find that part of you that is curious about how things work, that can laugh at absurdities.  Try to find someone who understands you.  Try to find the things that appeal to you.  Please live.  I don't know you, not at all, but I would still be very sad if you died.    




 The only thing that I think you may need to plan for is whether ME has a great need for game wardens post-grad.  You may need to move to do what you love.  Never pay more than the minimum on your loans once you graduate, there is no point.  Save every spare dime you have for a down payment on your house and start establishing your credit.  You do that by paying for things (meaning bills) on time consistently and by opening at least one line of credit.  Once you're in the workforce, don't forget to put some money into your retirement.  It's very important to start that early. :)

Good luck, I like what you're saying here.   




 I think the determining factor is how important your family is to you.  Some people are very family oriented and are happiest living near them, I'm one of those people.  If I were you, I would regret not moving home.  Money is one of those things that's very transient.  As they say "If you wait until you have enough money to have a baby, you will never have a baby."  A pay cut is something you'll figure out if it means being near your family.

Now if you're not that close to your family, you've got the right idea.  You need to identify if you're happy with your current situation, and if you're not, do things to make it what you want!  Remember, we can literally die at any moment, annnnny moment at all.  Think, if I were to die tomorrow, would I regret anything or would I die peacefully?  Do what you can to deal with any regrets you think you might have. :)  




 Hello!

A few things:

-Make sure your resume isn't from a template, you want it to be unique looking in style, professional but memorable!

-When applying, always write a cover letter for your resume.  Consider acknowledging that you don't have a lot of history, but that your drive and skills are a great fit for the company and they only need interview you in person to see how passionate you are to being part of their team.  Be earnest if that's who you are!

-Volunteer.  If you need something for a resume but don't have years of work history to illustrate your talents, volunteer in fields related to what you want to do.

Hope this helps! :) 




 The tone of this complaint is very disturbing.  You're calling his behavior gross, insinuating that you've been confronting him, accusing him of being lazy, admitting that you've been locking things up from someone you're supposed to be taking care of... 

You're the epitome of an unreliable narrator, but if what you're saying *is* true, he's probably acting out because negative attention is better than no attention at all.  

Listen, children who come from broken homes are not always easy to deal with.  They may not come to you with open arms and open hearts and that has nothing to do with you personally.  You're clearly dealing with inadequacy issues to be this defensive towards someone who is so much younger than you.  You need to shelve it.  Be the bigger person, the adult.  Make up your mind to love him no matter what, no matter how hard it is, no matter if you're ever thanked, no matter if he looks just like your husband's ex-wife.  Just choose.  Choose the right thing.  Even if he never lets you in, being a kind, good person to someone who needs that in their life is its own reward.  I really hope you can turn this around.    




 You need to cut that emotional extortionist out of you life.  Block her number, change your e-mail address, cut her out!  

You do not need someone like this in your life, no one deserves to be treated like less than a human being and from what you've put here, that's just what she's doing.  

I'm not sure what exactly to say about how you can get back up, since I don't know much about your life situation (Are you graduating high school soon?  Terribly depressed?  Considering a move?  Stuck at home?), but if you would like to discuss any of that privately, please don't hesitate to shoot me a PM and I'll do my best to help you work through whatever.  
 




 First of all, you should never apologize for working towards what you've wanted the most all your life.  You're a hard working, driven individual who should be lauded.... a wonderful example for the people around you.  Don't feel guilty.  This is your life.  You have to be your own advocate.

You don't need to break it off, and I know I'm about to say one of the worst words in the relationship lexicon, but here we go: Give him the ultimatum.  Just tell him in an organized, calm manner what you basically explained here: You have been working your whole life to build a wonderful career and life for yourself away from this place that holds so many bad memories for you.  That you want the very best for yourself and your family, and that means being in a place where you can excel professionally and personally.  That you want him to be your family more than anything, but you just can't go home.  

He's probably going to break things off, maybe even for a bit, but he'll probably also come back.  And if he doesn't?  You'll know for sure that it wasn't meant to be.  He'll have done you a favor.  We always want what is best for the people we love.  If he really can't be happy unless he's home, and you can't be happy back at home, the two of you need to find happiness apart, but the truth is that a lot of times, guys just fear change.  He may well just give in when you make it clear that his refusal to move forward will cost him his relationship with you. 




 You either owe your friends an apology or you're being paranoid (so an apology isn't going to hurt).  I would just reach out via a text or an e-mail or even on the phone if you care a lot, a lot about that person and say something to the effect of "I wanted to apologize to you for not being as available as I've been in the past.  Your friendship is very important to me, so I want to make it very clear that while this in no way excuses my carelessness, it has everything to do with my wedding and the move and nothing to do with how I feel about you.  When all this is done, we should get together; I promise not to say one word about me.  I miss you and I'll see you soon."  Follow it up with a few random texts here and there between your apology and the wedding.  Nice things like "I saw an interview with George Clooney this morning, and it reminded me of that time, blah blah blah. You're great."  Just let them know they're on your mind. :) 




 The best way to handle stage fright and to make your speech better (not to mention get those extra points for time) is to practice your speech in its entirety, aloud, and time it.  You don't need to have an audience, although a tester will be able to give you pointers.  Hope this helps!   




 When you say "live on your own" do you mean you want to buy a house?  




 I met my husband at work.  Initially he was above me in the company, but I was not one of his reports.  Eventually I was promoted beyond his role.  A lot of people within the company had no idea we were married.  We made it a point to not be affectionate at work.  We talked about work related things when we needed to.  We had to go to meetings together and sometimes worked on assignments together.  It is important to report your relationship to your HR representative.  They will decide if your immediate supervisor needs to know.  Just keep it professional! :) 




 Hello ExDrK;

Almost all jobs have a 30 day grace period in which either party can terminate the working relationship without notice.  Sometimes this is included in the offer letter, sometimes it's just a disclaimer form, sometimes it is in the Non-Disclosure agreement.  I would got to your HR representative (or call the phone number for the service they use) and ask.  Just be very apologetic and professional and nice.  The truth is that most employers don't really want employees who don't want to be there, it's more respectful to just come out with it.  

Hope this helps!  




 I guess my question would be why does she need to move 1000 miles away to study veterinary science?  You can literally do this anywhere!  I can understand that she might be in more demand in a large city, but that's neither here nor there until she's licensed.  Unless you're going to tell me she's planning to move in with a specific relative there, I would question if she isn't just looking for a way out of the relationship.  If it were me, I'd actually go along any way.  You only live once, and while all change can be scary, it is almost always worth it.  You could live in a new city, explore a new field, and if the relationship goes south, meet new people.  Worst comes to worst, move back.  The truth is that you're in charge of your own destiny.  Think about what would really make you happy and go for it!  




 Well, I'm guessing that you probably have folks on staff that could do similar work, if you need to know now, you could bring them the examples and ask them to guestimate how long they would take to build something similar from the ground up.  I'm sorry I'm not able to give you anything more concrete!  I'm sure you'll figure it out. :) 




 This isn't particularly scientific, but if it were me, I'd take the documents to their contributors in person and ask them to estimate how much time they put into them, conservatively.  Unless you have access to the original files, that's probably the best you'll be able to do.   




 Exit only, bro. 




 Hey, thank YOU for posting the awesome reference link.  I get really jazzed about this sale... I typically can't afford their eyes (in good conscience) until this happens, so I figured someone else might want to know. :) 




 Sorry to piggy-back, but that's another great thing about Amazon.  A lot of the albums you buy physical copies of come with a complimentary digital copy via auto-rip.  I love that I can order vinyl for my collection, but still have the convenience of "traveling copies" at no extra cost.  Before anyone asks, I'm not a paid rep for Amazon, I just really like it! 




 Thanks for the suggestion.  I'll check it out, maybe.  Have an upvote. :) 




 I think you're just being downvoted because he specified that he wasn't looking for iTunes in his question, but here, have an upvote on me. :) 




 Oh, no, don't worry about it man.  I can definitely see why you would think that. :) 




 I would imagine this would be a good combination... he probably gets you to experience things you wouldn't otherwise while not being such a Pollyanna that you'd get annoyed. :) 




 Two craziest things:

1) Someone had set up a glass of water with two perfect plastic REPLICAS of Beyer Asprin.  I've done some digging on the internet and still can't figure out why such a thing exists.  I have them in my jewelry box still almost ten years later.

2) We moved the credenza for spring cleaning and under it was a bag from the local sex shop.  It was full of those cheap dirty paperbacks and an un-opened package of huge anal beads.  




 There's a lot of hate for country music since people just think of Toby Keith or some other ignorant asshole.  There happens to be good country music out here.  I like Whiskeytown, Loretta Lynn, Neko Case, Shovels and Rope, the country Neil Young albums, Ryan Adams, I could go on...  




 I'm actually surprised at how much neutral there is... I can't really relate to this:
 
A neutral character does what seems to be a good idea. She doesn't feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good vs. evil or law vs. chaos. Most neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality. Such a character thinks of good as better than evil-after all, she would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones. Still, she's not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way.  




 Well, truthfully, he would never cheat.  I know that probably sounds like I'm taking him for granted, but, I mean, he never leaves the house and refuses to have anything to do with any person who isn't his immediate family.  Short of skipping work to have an affair (someone who loses 20+ hour a year in PTO because he refuses to take a day off, right), it would be ultra mega obvious.  

But we're playing pretend here.  If he did, I wouldn't really care much, but I would probably still leave.  




 So many stories about this guy, but one of the better ones what that we had a sheet of water running down into our living room (like two feet across, a literal sheet of water)... his explanation?  The water comes from Lake Superior, so it's extra cold... that water is condensation from the cold pipes and the warm air. 

Turned out to be the upstairs neighbor's bathtub overflow... she was just leaving the water on while she was in there.   




 Real Talk: I don't think cheating is a deal breaker, but if my husband cheated on me, I'd probably take it as a get out of jail free ticket and leave, never to re-marry.   




 I'm Chaotic - Good. :)

Edit: Description: A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him. He makes his own way, but he's kind and benevolent. He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations. He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do. He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society.  




 This is pretty awesome if you're not sure: http://www.easydamus.com/alignment.html  




 In MMOs, I like to be altruistic.  If I see a newbie, I ask them if they have any questions or need anything.  I like community in an MMO and eventually that little player you helped gets really good. :)

On Facebook, I think it's best to only use it as a virtual photo album for your long-distance family.  I tend to try to only post supportive things and photos for people who can't be close enough to see my family in person.

LinkedIn is something I only recommend you use if you have impressive networking contacts.  It's rather pointless if you don't.

My tactics on Reddit is mostly to just be nice.  It's worked out pretty well, everyone seems a lot nicer than I thought they would be going in. :)

Hope this helps! 




 Here you go, folks: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vvijiNjplLs/Uj26mtv3_sI/AAAAAAAACNA/n3gxV5xgj_s/s1600/harry-potter-chart.jpg

I'm actually an INFJ, so this isn't really a question to me, but, hell, three out of four is pretty good, I think... I don't really have an easy time doing social networking.  I have to talk myself into calling strangers.  The best advice I can give you is to keep your arms uncrossed, have a pleasant look on your face, if you're in a group, invite loners in, think of a few questions that you wouldn't mind being asked yourself and ask them.  This is pretty specific to how to network in a large group, so if you're looking for something else, just hit me with a reply and I'll help. :) 




 Well, I think your question goes to show that you actually think you should pay for the music you listen to, and good for you.  The average musician actually makes less than $50k a year.  I get my MP3s from Amazon.  Unlike iTunes, it's an actual MP3 file if you choose to download it.  You still have cloud storage and can get applications for both iOS and Droid.  You can even listen on your work computer from the website without downloading anything.  Hope this helps!  




 I think it depends on what kind of person your parent is.  My own mother is one of those people who is convinced that the way she thinks is the only way to think (not just with me, but with her husband... the phrase she uses is "yes, but they're wrong!"), as a consequence, she's a very poor listener.  I can tell her things flat out and she's trying so hard to hear things she can relate to, she never remembers a thing!  

I would imagine if your parent were one of those people who is constantly seeking a different point of view or who is curious about the world at large would have observed a million and six things about you without your noticing.  ;) 




 I think the biggest thing I'm dealing with right now is recognizing what people mean when they say "marriage is hard."  Like, I heard that and assumed it would be obvious, like you will argue and you need to make up or compromise or whatever.  I had no idea what was meant was that you're probably going to wonder all the time if the negative things are "normal."  

My husband doesn't really like to engage in conversations or discussions, he doesn't like to do things or travel, and he has a very low sex drive.  For a jag there I was thinking "Is this what a neglectful marriage is?  Should I leave?"  But I'm starting to recognize that what I make of my life is still my own responsibility.  I've abandoned waiting for his participation to do things that I want to do, I've started going out for drives and seeing things of visual interest, watching movies alone, going out to eat, volunteering, basically doing the things I seemed to think for some reason were off limits since he didn't want to do them.  It's not like he told me I can't, so only my own pre-conceived notion of what marriage is stopped me from doing these things.

I am starting to recognize what ha925 mentioned in their comment: Being able to control yourself during the downtimes.  Recognizing that there is a middle ground between all or nothing.  But I also agree with not-quite-obscure in a moderate way.  I don't think I'd ever do this again.  It seems to be a bit unnatural a lot of the time.   




 Ahahaha, my former boss joked with my husband about arranging a marriage between our babies (his son is two months old, my daughter is 7 months), he told me my husband's eyes went totally flat and he said 100% seriously "I don't think she's ever going to date."   




 Also true... a kid is like an automatic extra $3000 back on your taxes... of course, that doesn't really approach what you're spending on them, but you know.... Surprise you have $3000 is nice for paying back your co-pay for the delivery or getting a new roof on your house.  Thanks, Uncle Sam!  




 This is so true... my best friend had warned me that this would happen, and I was like "whatever, I'm going to watch a Serbian Film now," but I was so wrong.  I can't read or watch anything involving abuse to children!  I can't even read the damn newspaper!  Why did I never notice how much infanticide is in the newspaper before?!  




 I wholeheartedly relate to your first point... I don't think I've gone to the bathroom when I've wanted to or eaten a hot meal at an actual table in 6 months!  However, you don't even hesitate, this is what you do now.  You learn to love the cold coffee.  Ha ha. 

The second was longer in coming for me, it actually only hit me about a month ago.  I think it's because she has a personality now.   




 We never argue and here's why: My husband doesn't ever engage.  I'll say I feel x, y, and z, and this is why.  He'll stare at me.  Sometimes an hour later he'll come back and apologize for "being an asshole," or not knowing I felt that way.  That's how it works.  Very dramatic, huh?

Edit: Sorry, I ignored part II of the question.  My big points of contention are basically that he doesn't hear me.  How many times do I have to tell you that I can't stand not being able to see a damn thing in the house, but I still come home to find you swapped all the lightbulbs for colored ones that don't light anything?  Or why is it that when I'm trapped in the car with you we have to listen to Pig Destroyer three turns too loud and when I ask you to turn it down, you ignore me?  I know women get a bad rap for expecting men to read their minds, but I tell him what I want all the time, and it basically only guarantees that I won't get it.  It's exhausting.  




 Initially, there is no autonomy.  I know as a mother, my immediate feeling when I came home was that no one could swoop in and save me, this creature needed ME to feed her and no matter how tired or sore or scared or anything I was, it was too bad, here we are!  That was an odd feeling, I've never felt it before or since.  




 I recommend that you just start doing small things by yourself that give you room to breathe.  I volunteer with a hospice on the weekend, and my assignments require me to drive for an hour both ways to see my ladies.  This time by myself in the car with music I like to listen to greatly quells my wanderlust.  

A lot of the things that you've mentioned aren't really things that you can simply go out and do without there being some damage, but you know, I said to my husband (who is a major homebody and allergic to spending money) that I wanted to travel when our daughter was older.  I told him that I would love for him to come, but that if he didn't, I still needed to go.  I think a lot of young people go into marriage thinking that it means you'll do things together all the time, but the truth is that you might not ever do a thing if you wait for the other person to participate.  It's okay to do things alone! It makes you feel capable and smart and free.   




 Sorry for being redundant in the way this is worded, but how has being married changed what you thought marriage would be like as a single person? 




 I legit think it would be like the movie series the Purge.  It was be wayyy fucked up.   




 Pig Faced Women!  Specifically that there was a rich philanthropist who was believed to BE ONE and she couldn't even dispel it by making public appearances... It had to be an actress that she hired since we actually believe she has the head of a pig.... Also getting bears drunk, shaving their faces, putting them in dresses and then claiming they are pig-faced women in your freak show?  Is this all made up?  What on earth! 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcAj3lOyv3s 

I had no idea that this was actually a THING, I thought this commercial was SATIRE.  Thanks for making it funny!  




 I feel a sense of community.  I like that I can give my opinion on things and not have it dis-counted because of the way I look... no one knows how I look!  I'm less lonely, I laugh more, and I think about things I might never have considered before.  I love reddit!   




 Mostly trivia in very specific areas.  I don't even know any Warren Zevon fans in real life but if I do I'll be able to regale them with all kinds of chestnuts!  Or what about the birth order and sun signs of the entire Culkin family?  Do you want to know everything I know about the North American Bison.  Sit down, sir.  I'll help you with that.... Now serial killer trivia, I use that SOMETIMES.  Like twice a year.  On Reddit.  




 People whistling.  In all seriousness, I don't even whistle to myself when I'm alone.  That's how disgusting I find it to be.  It literally gives me a facial twitch.  




 I occasionally reply with "Who is this?" to texts I receive when I know damn well who it is.  




 I can actually count on one hand the moments I've been passive aggressive, and so they're both pretty good stories.

1. At my first job there was this girl who would never switch shifts with anyone EVER.  But she would go to the owner and have get the boss to make her the closer when she wanted extra money.  When she would steal this shift from me while I was actively working it, I would pour sweet and sour sauce on the tile floor, knowing she had to mop it and it was a bitch.

2. My old apartment had a HUGE window on one wall.  The neighbor would leave the porch light on all night, so I couldn't sleep well as it was bright, and my dogs would bark at things moving in the driveway.  I asked my husband to turn it off after an hour, but he didn't want to offend the neighbor.  One day when the light had been on all night and all of that day, I went out with a broom and very lightly tapped the lightbulb, breaking the filament in it, so it appeared to have burned out from being on all the time.  The damn thing was nine feet up, so it wasn't like they were going to change it.  Ahahaha!   




 I'd be living very differently.  I'd get a motorcycle and go to Sturgis and live in a new city every few years and I'd be out camping by myself all the time.   




 This is pretty geeky, but whatever.... I wore a sweater I had knitted to work and someone stopped me and said she "Would buy something like that.... no really!"  It was like.... I spent about $100 on this hand painted yarn, and it took several hundred hours to make and you're condescending to tell me you would buy something like it, no really?  Go away.  




 Oh dear, he missed his reflex check to catch it in time. :( 




 Where were you when I was a kid? :)  I like your reddit contributions, technobarry.  You're a cool cat.  




 Shut up!  Really?  I had no idea.... that's really weird to think about.... 80 year old octopuses.... I'm going to have to Google this. :) 




 I would watch the fuck out of Steve Buscemi's! :) 




 What if it's in octopus years?  (Yes, I just thought you were that funny on that other thread....I'm still crying from laughter.) 




 I just got my pre-ordered copy... it's actually pressed in Germany apparently.  




 This isn't about me and my child, but I have one of my mom's:

In 1992, my mom was married to a construction worker.  He took her with on an out of town job.  The hotel had a fabulous pool, and my mom really wanted to go swimming.  She didn't have a swimsuit.  Her husband said he would buy her one if she'd have sex with him that night.  She stipulated that she wanted tequila too if that's what needed to be done.  This is the night she conceived my youngest sister.  My sister was the consequence of a sex barter for a swimsuit.  I'm never to tell her on penalty of death.  




 I'm the assistant to a lady-CEO! :)  




 It sounds like you have anxiety.  Hey! Me too!  But I'm conventionally very successful, I have a house and a beautiful baby and a husband and a respectable career where I make more than the average American (and much more than the average woman).  

This has helped me some of the time, and when it doesn't initially, it does after I've had time to process further: From "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living" 1. Imagine the worst possible outcome of the issue at hand. 2. Accept that it could happen. 3. Think of ways to make the best of that worst possible outcome. 

As my former boss liked to say, don't get crushed by the rock, break the rock into smaller pieces and deal with them as you can. :) 




 State of the Union Address Given : Most hilarious jokes in the world made. 

Body: Lots of analytical text that boils down to how when you get beyond the hilarious jokes mixed in, the President just over analyzed several creative possible actions before dissolving into a tangent about how they are conscious this isn't helping.  Compassion and exasperation ensue.   




 Well, when I was four, my mom asked me what I wanted to be went I grew up.  I told her I wanted to be an artist.  She said "Artists don't get paid anything until they're dead."  So I kept my eyes open.  At five, I went to my first funeral and met a friendly mortician.  I wanted to be a mortician until I was, like, 14.  You can see I had a fucked sense of humor even then.  

I'm not a mortician, but I have succeeded in making something to the tune of $200 in my lifetime for art.  Look out!   




 I really, really hope that your retirement is magical.  That you do all those things you wanted to but never had the time or felt guilty doing.  (100% sincere) 




 It's misplaced, but it's well-meaning.  

I actually just had a moment of clarity thinking about this.  My mom and I were talking and she casually mentioned that my sister has just decided not to go in and get her prescription renewed for her birth control.  I was beyond dismayed.  She's 23, living in a rented house with a roommate, broke, and getting married in two months.  I want to tell her that she has her whole damn life to raise babies... that she should enjoy her husband and travel and live a reckless life before committing to a baby (I have a 6 month old with my husband, so I'm projecting.).  My mother pointed out to me that my sister was much better set up than she herself was when she had her first child (me).  And in thinking about it, my mom was homeless and my father was an abusive drug addict.  No one would advise pregnancy under those circumstances... but here I am, married, a homeowner, with a career, making more than the average American, and a mother to a beautiful baby... hell, I even have rescue dogs and volunteer with a hospice.... What am I worried about?    




 Actually, this brings up a great one for me: People always tell you that marriage is hard work.  I always imagined they meant that you will fight (and, hey, no problem! I can handle that) but the truth is probably a lot more subtle than that.  Sometimes you feel invisible and taken for granted.  You didn't enter into a partnership in which you will do everything together... you might have married someone who will never want to take that trip or whatever... you need to move beyond what you thought your life would be like.  This has been something of a rough, and altogether different type of hard than I was imagining when I heard about it. 




 Why exactly am I reacting this way?  It's important when you have anxiety to screen any knee jerk reactions to things for irrationality.  So if I'm putting off making a phone call to a stranger to get catering for an event, I need to recognize that's what I'm doing and talk myself into fixing it. 

It used to be "What have I done for my marriage today?"  




 Just rapping on some theory here: I think the only reason you would cheat emotionally would be because, right or wrong, you feel lonely or disconnected with the people in your life.  It's a human impulse to want to be understood and valued.  Unless you're just curious.  I could see that too. 




 Assimilation of Native Americans and Internment of Japanese-Americans. 




 Passive aggression.  Or expecting me to read your mind... we are adults, you use your words!!!!  




 Yes, some variation on this: Older = Smarter.  This is pure ego on my part, but I feel so cheated when I see through people who should, for all intents and purposes, be better than everyone else, but aren't.  Like when my former boss, the CEO of his third company, tried to manipulate me by relating that we both grew up poor and refused to be victims.... Like, I wanted him to be able to manipulate me without my knowing that was what he was doing... He was all parlor tricks!  Where is the magic!?  

I cried for a whole week straight when I started at a call center and realized that there were 50 year olds whose actual aspirations were to continue working their entry level jobs at $8.50/hr and pick on younger people.  Like, no!  Why did you stop growing at 14?! Why did you do that?  Be better!  




 Right, unless there is more to this scenario, it's perfectly responsible to have a life insurance plan.  I'm guessing that since you're going to grad school, you've already got a huge amount of debt.  If Canada is like the US in that regard, your parents could be saddled with that debt if, heaven forbid, anything should happen to you.  I have taken out term life insurance on my husband (in addition to the insurance I have on myself) because we have a mortgage and an infant child.  If anything happened to either of us, I wouldn't want my child to lose her home as well as a parent.  Life insurance is just good planning. :) 




 Quite right, we always make time for the things that are truly important to us.  I sometimes think that I should feel guilty for working full time and then volunteering for six hours at a hospice one day of the weekend, but then I have to remind myself that what I'm doing is making my headspace better so that when I'm with my daughter, I'm the best I can be.  




 Unfortunately, I don't think it will, you see he had to have a six month probationary period where he had to drive with another licensed driver, but he's married to one... So it wasn't an issue. Initially learning is going to be the tricky part, but I'm sure you could use online videos for the theory of it... Do you think you could maybe offer carpooling? Then in theory, a licensed driver would come to your house, and you would drive the two of you to a location like a school or shop? Or maybe you could look into community education? I took what we call "Behind the wheels" with an instructor that I paid.  




 Can you tell us what state you live in?  The laws and guidelines vary greatly from state to state.  If not, just say so and I can still help by relaying how my husband got his license at 38. :) 




 Please, don't take this as nay-saying, but I'd feel guilty if I didn't mention that in the time I was using the Nuvaring, I suffered recurrent yeast infections.  This is not uncommon (14% of women experience it as a side effect according to Google).  I never had this problem prior to the Nuvaring, and I was on it at age 24.  I didn't ever have trouble with it coming out on accident, like the other posters, I took it out during intercourse... it was uncomfortable to leave in during. 




 Nobody has recommended boric acid yet.  Please Google it before writing it off; this has been immensely helpful to me.  I started getting recurrent infections after using the Nuvaring, even after I switched birth control methods.  A yeast infection has an 80% chance of recurrence, so using anti-biotics is really just a risky band-aid that comes with a hefty medical bill after.  I got 00 size gel caps off of Amazon and a bottle of powdered boric acid.  If I have an infection, I insert two capsules a day (one in the morning, one at night) vaginally.  If you choose to do this, you'll want to use a panty liner.  I also do just a half gel cap after my period or after intercourse just to be safe.  I also use an oral probiotic: Acidophilus.  I get that at Wal-Greens.  I hope things get better for you!     




 Hmmm. You just described the first feature of "Family Portraits: A Trilogy of America." 









 This has helped me some of the time, and when it doesn't initially, it does after I've had time to process further: From "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living" 1. Imagine the worst possible outcome of the issue at hand.  2. Accept that it could happen.  3. Think of ways to make the best of that worst possible outcome.  

After the sheer hell that was my failure at breastfeeding followed by months of exclusive pumping that lead to three bouts of mastitis and finally Reynauld's syndrome of the nipples, I had to accept that I was going to have to give up.  This process, writing down that I would have more time with my family, get more sleep, feel less pain, focus more on my baby, be happier, etc, helped me move beyond what seemed at first a crushing failure.  This is a major example of when I used this, but as a person who struggles with anxiety about pretty much everything, you can use it to keep things in perspective.  

People with anxiety tend to be pretty capable when they know what is coming so thinking "If the meter runs out and I get a ticket, I know I can map the way to court house and that I can afford the ticket.  It will be annoying, but it is not the end of the world," can make a big difference. 

Good luck... in reading through your Reddit contributions, you seem like a warm, funny, and intelligent lady.  I'm sure you'll figure things out.  I believe in you!  




 The fact that you down voted only the reply where I wrongly accused you of being obtuse makes me love you a little bit.  I'm sorry. (I'm being 100% sincere.) 




 Because I also work in a field where I'm stuck using a stupid style guide and it's updated all the time.  I do think you're being a bit obtuse here, my point still stands, and in fact, you're making it very more to the point... none of it is consistent or organic!   




 I'm sure they've since been updated.  "Iris" isn't plural, but "Adams" is! 




 I didn't go, just because I'd gone in 11th grade, so what was the point?  This along with my decision to not go to the all-night grad party or the graduation dinner or the Sno-Ball my senior year are things I regret on a moderate level now.  The truth is that the business of being young is incredibly fleeting, and you never get to go back and do those things again.  Even if they are terrible, they make for even better stories years later.  I spent a lot of my teenage years trying to be a little adult, and that is sad because I'll be an adult for the rest of my life.... you can only be young and do these things now.   




 The rules are not consistent.  "Mary's" is possessive, "Iris's" is correct, but "Iris'" isn't, even though "the cars'" would be if you mean more than one car that possesses something... meanwhile "it's" can only be "it is," with "its" being possessive, being at odds with everything I just wrote out for you above.  It is any wonder at all that people get confused?     




 You know what I love about this question?  It assumes that people don't have a 'type,' that they don't act like John Wayne Gacy and only pick victims that are tall, thin, and have shaggy blond hair.  




 Lack of "whole foods" meaning food that hasn't been chemically modified or otherwise messed with.  Putting a damn window in a chicken coop doesn't make the chickens in it "free range."  There is a reason why we have so many dietary issues in the US.  30+ flavors of pop tarts doesn't help. 




 I liked the graphic novel "Black Hole" by Charles Burns.  




 And even the reason we have the right to bear arms! 




 Every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back I hope you feel it. 




 This is what I'm talking about!!!! THAT IS IRONIC.  It's ironic!  Why, why would you assume there would be a non-smoking rule in the smoking room?  That is the opposite of what you would expect!  




 How about things we have to see often:

"Just in case you thought Memorial Day was about barbecues" - Oh yeah, I totally have met that person who talks about today as national hotdog day.  That's a thing that happens! /sarcasm

"Why don't we have White History Month?" - I'm sorry, what do you think we're studying the other 11 months of the year?

"It's time we stopped apologizing for being American." - The person going door to door in Iowa demanding you drag our great nation through the mud has failed to come to my house.

"Like if you support drug testing for food stamps" - Guess what! Drug dealers don't typically accept food stamps for drugs, but you know who does take food stamps? Grocery stores. You can use the food stamps to feed the children who didn't ask to be born to the drug addicts.  You know, the ones whose food money was spent on drugs. 




 You know, I thought the big dissension about this song was very presumptuous.  The argument that things were "unfortunate" instead of "ironic" assumes that she didn't expect an opposite outcome.  I don't think it's a stretch to assume your wedding day would be perfect, or that on a single plane ride, you would be safe.  Am I crazy? 




 Just follow their sentence that ended in "sir" with a soft, non-aggressive "ma'am."  You know, correct them in a quiet sort of way.  Unless they're totally not listening, they'll apologize profusely.  I've got a bit of experience with this having done phone work. I hope this helps you. :) 




 Respond in a nearly inaudible voice so that if they want to hear what you have to say, they have to pipe the fuck down. ;)

I'd make it a rule not to acknowledge behavior you don't appreciate.  




 "Lucky Now" by Ryan Adams.  Why did he choose to not repeat the chorus after the last verse?  I love that song, but at 2 minutes and 30 odd seconds, you can't put it on repeat. :) 




 It is a word that can be applied to denote a situation that has opposite outcome of what one would expect.  




 I think, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you read my response as the fear being my own.  It is not.  One thing I'm learning is that people are conscious of their own memory loss and disconcerted by it.  I don't fear my own death or degenerative brain disorder.  I'm acting to try to alleviate the pressure these patients feel to remember things.  They don't really need to bother.  It's irrelevant.    




 Cinnamon Rolls and Chili! :)
