 This is a good idea. I am lvl 30 with 500 something wins(not saying that is good). I have only played 3 ranked games, and I was invited to those games not knowing it was ranked(duo queue). I'm not saying you should be able to make your own avatars but if they did add it in, they should maybe have ranked games be a part of it. 




 Fiora? Underpowered? I think she can do massive damage and has a pretty low cooldown counter ability. I mean sure you can build armor to make her do less damage (as you can with other melee carries) but I would never call her underpowered. She doesn't need a nerf though, imo. 




 And Fizz's shark, Malzahar's Voidling, Urf, nidalee (both forms), Sejuani's boar,and Orianna's ball. :) 
























 How to play sion: ignore everything your team says and farm solo top for the first 30-40 minutes of the game, then show up late to a team fight use your ultimate to heal all of your teammates, get the ace, then push to win and kill anything that gets in your way. This guide only works if your team doesn't feed. 




 I love your songs so much. Since seeing your cypher I have heard most of your songs, please keep making them. 




 I agree Kat is not UP, I play her most of the time, and do good a lot with her, and almost always win my lane. If she gets fed early, she is very hard to stop unless you have hard CC, but even then if she is built she can be a problem for the other team.
