 So I'm going to hell right?

 Don't you dare. 




 Thanks much. 




 Headunits, speakers, subwoofers, receivers, amplifiers, harnesses: I don't get it. Can anyone easily explain all this stuff to me or link me to an article that walks you through what each unit contributes? Making a car sound nice is confusing stuff.  




 Funny that would happen right after "The Gang Desperately Tries to Win an Award".  




 I clicked the picture without looking at the subreddit, and prayed that I was in /r/cringepics. 




 Is this still a Guy Ritchie thing? 




 I was at a Chili's (chain restaurant). We had just ordered a desert when the guy in front of us starting violently projectile vomiting all over his table and the aisle and all surrounding tables. Eventually the ambulance showed up and took him away. He never stopped vomiting. Worst part: we were in an alcove and he was blocking the way out, so we were trapped behind him, with our food and table puke-drizzled, for a good 15 minutes.  




 Yeah she was a bit mental. 




 Once when I was in middle school, I had an english teacher who was always getting on to me about leaning back in my chair. I didn't purposefully do it, it was just a bad habit. But after like the 5th time she had to tell me not too, she flipped out and threw a mug across the room and yelled at me saying that she wished I would fall over and crack my head open and shatter my skull because that would make me learn my lesson. She ranted on for a good 3 minutes before she just left the classroom. Everyone just kind of sat there and stared at me for a few minutes before we left. 

The next day she called me into her office and calmy, but very angrily, asked if I had been going around the school telling everyone that she said she wanted me to get brain damage and die (which she did), and I had to explain to her that considering she yelled at me in front of the entire class for five minutes, there was a good chance that I wasn't the only one that heard her wishes. She started grinding her teeth and shaking and told me to leave, and as soon as the door shut I heard her start hitting her desk and trying to hold in her screams.


Later that year, she tried to get me suspended/expelled for racism and called me in front of the principal and religion teacher and a bunch of other staff to discuss this, and they all realized she was talking out of her ass. I left that school after that year, but turned out she had some mental issues. She was fired the next year for assault with a deadly weapon (not in the classroom or anything). Her mugshot was hilarious. Always wanted to visit her in prison.  




 Why does this have thousands of downvotes? 




 What is your first major memory? 




 That's in all high school classrooms. 




 He didn't. 




 I recently worked on a movie he starred in. I wasn't very important at all but he treated me like the director whenever I talked to him. Really nice guy as far as I'm concerned.  




 "You can quote me on that."
Oh good. 




 So he mercifully bullies you? 




 The Road 




 Twelve Monkeys 




 If anyone's up for some PS3 co-op, add me.

 ....why is there nothing here? 




 Glenn Howerton should totally play the Riddler at some point. He'd be great. 




 So Dennis is definitely going to become a full blown serial killer this season, right? 




 Oh no ^darn ^^shoot ^^^don't ^^^^im ^^^^upset  




 Too obvious. Try again. 




 You'd love Curb Your Enthusiasm. 




 Also, the implication. 




 You must be an asshole. 




 Then what's behind the hand on the head? 




 They switched Skylar's and Walter's hands. Check the lighting. 




 I saw an outtake from the scene where Mac's dad was talking to Mac and Charlie about filling up their butts with heroin and they couldn't get through it because they were laughing too hard. What other scenes have been hard to get through without cracking up? 




 Who on the show is most like their character? 




 http://imgur.com/1RgjbxV I nominate Andy Milonakis to play Frank in some kind of flashback. They're the same size and everything. 




 Yeeeeeah... I'm going to go ahead and call bullshit.  




 I love you.  




 I wasn't aware this was a thing. I should have known this was a thing. 









 That's the movie I thought you were talking about, but Not Rated is VERY different from PG. Not Rated means the it was not taken the MPAA to be rated. That movie would be NC-17. 




 ...what PG movie has a real blowjob? 




 Well, he passes here. Still not too happy with it but we'll see. 




 Great. Now I want a hamburger. Thanks alot, OP. 




 ... Flip Flip Flipadelphia 




 That guy with the kid looked so confused and appalled.  




 This is so inaccurate. There were no exclamation marks in Max Payne 3.  




 Did you ever find out what was wrong with the kid or the family? Just mental problems or something? 




 Your best friend's frat bro is full of shit. 




 You should really further explore /r/ASMR 




 They should have gotten Jonathan Banks (Mike from Breaking Bad) to play Richard. 




 It wasn't staged. These judges are just programmed to overreact to everything that happens, and the producers let the worst go on as long as possible.

"Oh yeah. This is gold. Gotta upload this." 




 What's your favorite movie? 




 Unhealthy food is cheaper to produce than healthy food. Even now, buying an organic, locally grown apple is far more expensive than a regular apple grown in Mexico.  




 Also, the sticky notes Hank was using in his research were yellow. 




 Yes. Healthy food would become 10x more expensive than unhealthy food. 




 Love how he just casually throws out "making a transition of authority to me" 




 You photoshop like a god. 




 Spike Lee is a racist, egotistical megadouche. Plain and simple. 




 Well, sure. 




 Better late than never.

 Keep in mind: The writers wrote the "flash forward" sequence without knowing where they were going. So this could mean anything. Although this sounds highly plausible. 




 Reminds me of Premium Rush.

 As much as I love /r/thatHappened, keep it off every single Confession Bear. 




 ...well that went well. 




 Mac's side of the story was like one long post you would see on /r/thatHappened  




 I thought they made it very obvious Frank was Charlie's dad. Charlie mentions it in "The Gang Gets Analyzed", I think. They'll definitely bring it back up, but probably not until the shows almost over. 




 He was cultivating mass. 




 thats awesome. 




 Daww. I just watched the episode and had to make it. Laughed my ass off the whole way through. 




 say waaht? 




 Wow. Phyllis gettin work. 









 Pardon? 




 /r/forwardsfromgrandma  
























 I think it's great. The laughs all come from how horrible of a person Merchant is and a whole lot of horribly awkward / cringeworthy situations. Give it a shot. 














 The gif of Jennifer Lawrence making out with Amy Adams WILL make the front page.

 No they won't. Facebook has basically accepted this especially since they started to compete with it through Instagram direct.  




 I have a 1 TB WD MyPassport Ultra formatted with 1 partition to Fat-32. It is plugged into the PS3 via USB with the folders Music, Photo, Video, Game, and PS3. Whenever I use backup utility it says "Connect storage media at the save destination". I have looked all over and can not find out what I have done wrong. Help? 




 Nice catch.

 Favorite movie? And if you could pick anyone to play you in a movie, who would you pick? 




 I'm confused. What is this? 




 That's not a real subreddit, silly.  




 This is really cool. If you keep this up, a yearly breakdown would be top. 









 Reminds me of [Will Grello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-m7mBSw-5k).

 Premature commenting. Thought I already deleted it. 




 They're the same age? Holy shit I thought Matt Damon was much younger than Mark Wahlberg. 




 My old American Lit teacher is a dead ringer for Hugh Laurie. I can't find a picture, but he did have an autographed photo of Hugh that was signed "to my twin". 




 Ahhhh shit yeah. Thanks. 




 What is this? 




 Well I'll be damned. My mistake. 




 He didn't say it was shit he just said it was really slow.  




 "Life isn't about being liked, it's about being effective"

 Geez, stop being so OCD and let the man continue to think he's OCD.

 Nice try, Bieber 




 If they work quick they could get Idris Elba.  




 Of course Wil.I.Am is somehow involved. 




 Woah...when did this guy de-fat himself?

 On the other hand, I met Macklemore in the NBA store in NYC two or three days ago. Dude seemed really sad and didn't say a word as I asked for a picture. Made me feel like a bit of an asshole for asking although I've been a huge fan for a while. He was all alone and looked tired as shit.  




 Please tell me that was some kind of essay you had already written and not just a reddit comment.  




 Goddammit.  




 I don't think this will happen, but it's not always necessarily about bringing something new. Especially after finding so much success with Craig, I doubt they'd want to bring in someone completely different after his run is over.  




 /r/OldSchoolCool

 /r/FrugalJerk 




 I remember this guy. He used to be full of cringe and bullshit. He would make videos where he drank two bottles of vodka with no hands in 45 seconds and crazy stuff like that, and then he would upload videos saying he would never upload a drinking video again, swearing on his mother's grave. Then he would upload two more and delete the last video. Also he ran for that "KingOfTheWeb" thing where the winner would get some cash prize, and Shoenice had a smear campaign where he would trash the people who were beating him (usually teenaged make-up gurus), and he would encourage his fans to cheat and make multiple accounts to vote for him, and then he freaked out when he was banned. I used to message back and forth arguing with him and he would constantly lie and brag about his YouTube money and how he was so much better than me because he was making his living eat glue on street corners for YouTube. It was pretty funny, and pretty sad. 









 That's badass. 




 Thanks. I got that. I mean note wise. 




 Fuck.
