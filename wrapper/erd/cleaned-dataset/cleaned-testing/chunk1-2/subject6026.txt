 Looks more like a bear nose to me.. http://m.imgur.com/cLoTM2M 




 Where are these images from?
 




 I can relate. I have both versions of the game and doing the custom night challenges on pc are so much easier because of this. On the mobile port golden Freddy just kills you no matter what and I've sorta stopped attempting the rest of the custom night challenges because of this. Hopefully scott fixes this after fnaf 3 comes out. 




 Aww what a cute psychotic killer animatronic...



He actually is really cute in the drawing tho. 




 But why would scott eat something that usually taste really bad? Like really,really bad. 




 Scoot Cuthon
 
























 I was looking around the archive for scottgames.com and noticed that theres been alot of recent saves of the hat.jpg picture which usually means its been changed. It could just be something else of course and im not going to take my time to brighten each and everyone one of them.  




 Also the bad ending has golden freddys head in the background,while the good ending doesn't. 




 Ill delete this post, then. 




 Oh, sorry. I didn't see. 




 We all know that Golden Freddy Appears in the fnaf3 stage01 minigame since you play as him. The file dump for fnaf3 was recently released with the sound files and textures. While looking through the textures i found this guy (its #290 if you want to look for yourself) So, where do you guys think he is. Its transparent so he probably belongs somewhere unless scott removed him. Anyone seen him yet? 




 Yeah but there's sort of a dead body inside of it. You'd think the person buying it would've noticed.
