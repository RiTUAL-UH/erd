 How many people have you slept with ?
 




 I drink a lot of water before bed, that way if I wake up even a bit my "I really have to pee" response kicks in and I am out of the bed and into the bathroom.
edit typo 




 I think about it the same way i think about drinking, most people can do it in moderation and it isn't a big deal some people have an addiction that they may need to seek help for but in either case it is not my place to judge someone. My old roommate is an amazing person , she is also a self described food addict. She developed type 2 diabetes at 19, and that wasn't enough to make her change her eating and exercise habits. She is a RN now still obese still eats fast food 4 times a week. Part of her really wants to change , but for whatever reason she's not ready to take the steps needed. I still love her dearly and I want her to make changes and would be happy to help her do that but I know she has to be ready or it will never work. 




 Where are you standing on the scale? Standing to the back of the scale makes you lighter and the front heavier. If you are female it could also have to do with your cycle, and water retention. I would also look into your portions I worked out for 4 times a week for 3 months and didn't drop an ounce until I started counting calories, Myfitnesspal.com is a great place to start.Also sometimes it helped me to put the scale away for a while and only weigh every 2 weeks or so. Best of luck keep at it! 




 I teach US history to high school students, I want to start the beginning of each class this month with some interesting stories about African American Heros. I want to expose them to people they may  have never heard of though. So let me know who you wished you had learned about in High School.  




 I once had a man come up to me and tell me he liked my jeans, to which I replied oh thanks they are lucky brand, to which he replied I meant your phenotype. I then laughed and he said hot and smart, now you have to let me buy you a drink. More of a pick up line than a compliment but it worked we dated for three years. 




 I became a vegetarian when I was 12, I am now in my late 20s, I still weigh the same as I did in college. I have great blood pressure, and my resting heart beat is 55 bpm. Also I have noticed that I am aging better than many of my meat eating friends. It is better for the planet , and budget friendly. So for me it works if you are thinking about making the switch try cutting one thing out at a time, and adding to the list. Example this week I wont eat beef next week no beef or pork .

 Hey I used to work at a crisis hotline, and it sounds like your brother is taking some positive steps, he is talking about it and he is open to getting help. 
So now it sounds like we need to make him a safety plan. 
Step one :ask him if he has a plan to kill himself  if he does remove the means, get rid of pills guns razors whatever he has been thinking about using
Step two : Ask him what has helped him in the past when things have been though , talking to people ,writing everything down, running, everyone has their own ways to deal with stress what are his encourage him to try some of those things
Step Three : Ease the Pain, ask him if there is anything that helps him take his mind off of his problems even if it is only for a little while. Something that could give him a break from everything that is going on. (taking a bath, watching a movie reading a book whatever works for him)
Step four: get him around people even if it isn't friends studies have shown that just going to public places can ease suicidal thoughts
Step five : keep him away from drugs or booze, theses things increase the likely hood someone will attempt .
Step six: Who are his trusted listeners , it sounds like you are one of them but are there other people he feels like he can talk to about what is going on ? sometimes just talking about it can help even if nothing gets solved.
Listen to what he says, depressed people sometimes just want to vent what is going on and may not want a solution instead of offering ways to fix the problem ask the questions above and let him come up with his answers , he will be more likely to follow the plan if he comes up with it. 
Hopefully this will keep him safe until he can get professional help. You could also incorporate a crisis hotline or the ER into his safety plan as back ups. Hope this is helpful for you and I'll keep your brother in my thoughts 
Also he may not have an answer to all the questions and thats ok, the idea is to get him thinking about how he is going to get through the next few days.  




 1 It will seem really overrated in the beginning. 
2.Do it with someone you love the first time and there is a good chance you wont regret it.
3.Once you start having sex there is no going back. 
4. Don't let anyone pressure you into it, it is your choice how you use your body and who you use it with (this doesn't just go for your first time it goes for every time) 




 Assuming that there is a genetic component to homosexuality (which science is making a strong case for), It probably wont die out in a generation or two because like with any genetic trait their are many straight people who may not be gay themselves but may carry the gene. Much in the same way that two brown eyed parents can have a blue eyed child. On the other side of this is the fact that many gay couples do have children and use their own genetic information to do so, and just use a donor for the seamen or the egg (depending on which one they need).
 




 My boyfriend drooled on my pillow and when we woke up i said "ewww you drooled all by my face "
and he said laughing "it just means that I love you"
which is how he told me he loved me for the first time.
So if you want to distract a lady friend from your drool just drop the L-bomb 




 what's on the list? 




 I looked for the things that I got excited about, and for the things that pulled at my heart strings. that brought me to the idea that I wanted to help people  then I had to figure out what kind of job I could get helping people. I had always had an ability to break things down simply, so I would become a teacher. I tell me high school seniors to think about what they love and what they are good at and try to find a job that uses their talents  









 Well you can make the argument that he wasn't the first president, because we declared independence in 1776 and Washington didn't take office until 1789, so there was a 15 year period where other people ran the country. these men (all 8 of them) were presidents of congress because the position of president of the executive branch wasn't created until the Constitution was written.

 I had a high school students ask if the United States was part of the United Kingdom, the class fell apart laughing. I didn't want the kid to not ever ask a question again , so I said well not anymore but it started out that way, so I can see where that could be confusing everyone stopped laughing and the kid still ask questions. 




 I have dyslexia and instead of learning how to sound things out and turn letters into words I learned to sight read,I know what the word looks like to me. New words are difficult because I can't really read them, often i'll ask someone to read it to me and then I can typically remember. so maybe instead of trying to teach them the sounds of the letter you could try teaching them whole words. Remember what this word sounds and looks like. I guess this would depend on the case though, when I work with special education students I try to see what strengths they have and then use them to compensate for their weakness.  




 I think he was being chased for smoking on school property  




 Network like crazy, go to every job fair you can, check out the chamber of commerce meetings, and see what job connections your professors have.The longer I am in the professional world the more I agree with the statement "it isn't what you know , but who you know." Also be punctual and play nice with others, being late and not getting along with co-workers are the main reasons people get fired. 




 I once saw a police officer chasing a student the kid was wearing a backpack and when the officer grabbed it the kid just threw his arms back and slipped out of the backpack. Then the weight of the back pack knocked the policeman off balance and he fell into the street. Everyone who was watching cheered. 




 When some coughs or sneezes and then 20 min later they are on their death bed. 




 Once when I was young my parents had some friends over, around 830 my sister and I went to bed I woke up around 11 because I heard my parents laughing really hard I went to the stairs banister (where I could see them and they couldn't see me). They were smoking what I thought at the time were cigarettes with little scissors. It wasn't until I got to college that I realized that they were smoking joints with hemostats. 




 I wish I could take homeless people to my house on cold nights let them shower, feed them dinner and sleep over. I worry about them when it is cold outside.

 I am a horrible speller, this is made worse by the fact that I teach high school , at least once a class a student points out a spelling error that I have made.even spell check has no idea what I am trying to type sometimes.  




 I'd like to see a multi-party political system, and the end of winner take all elections. I like how in other countries what % of the vote you get determines how many seats the party gets in the legislative branch.

 I am surprised at how getting older doesn't make me sad, I am happier at 27 than I ever was at 21. With every birthday I just feel like I am turning into the person I was meant to be. 




 I am just taking a guess here but many people brink a Christmas tree into their house which has a somewhat minty smell so maybe the association happened that way. My other theory would be that peppermint sticks were white and red which were also Christmas colors so people bought them for decoration. However it would be hard to say if peppermint was white and red before the association , or because of the association.
 





























 It depends, if it is a large order than yes, because I am responsible for making sure that every thing comes out properly, boxing it up, and getting the other stuff like silverware, to go drinks etc., but even on a large order 10% is considered the standard. On a small order (2 or less meals) no tip required but leaving a dollar or two is always appreciated.  




 I've lived with a few male roommates, for the most part they are a bit messier than the girls I lived with, but had less drama so fair trade in my book. Some girls are crazy as fuck. 




 When I was 13 I had a friend who was form Vietnam, she had been in the US since she was 6 months old so she spoke english fluently. Her parents however spoke very little English. One night we were at he house and these guys we went to school with were all having a sleep over a couple blocks away, we decided to sneak out of the house and go hang out with the boys, after a few hours we needed to get back to the house and the guys walked us home to make sure we got there alright. When we climbed back through the window her dad woke up and thought someone was breaking into the house he called 911, and then busted in her door with a shotgun. He saw me and his daughter fully dressed sitting on her bed and a group of boys running away from the house, the cops then showed up. My friends dad told them they could leave and it was a misunderstanding. He then called my mom and told her I  was a "bad girl" and she needed to pick me up. While we were waiting for my mom he gave lecture about how dangerous it was to sneak out and to spend time with boys who could rape us. He would lecture for a few minuets then my friend would translate his words. When my mom showed up it came across like he was trying to blame us sneaking out on me ( I am not sure if he was truly trying to blame me or if it was his limited vocabulary). My mom then blamed him for not keeping a better eye on us. My friend and I weren't allowed to hang out anymore after that. That was almost 15 years ago and we are still best friends today.  




 I love my job, it is the most challenging, and rewarding thing I have ever done. It pushes me to be a better person every day because I want to be better for my students every day. I  have kids tell me their darkest secrets and I am always happy to try and help them sort out what is going on in their life. I do enjoy my content area, but it pales in comparison to the students and how they touch my life. You are going into one of the most important professions in society, for some students you will be one of the only good role models they have, one of the only adults they trust, you will be able to push them to expand their mind, they will love you and because of that they will be willing to at least try to do the work. Do everything out of love, even when kids get in trouble, explain why the rules are important for everyone to follow so that the classroom is safe and that the punishments are their for the same reason . I very rarely yell, I find it is much more effective to talk to students in the hall way if we are having issues then to just jump to a detention. Often times kids still get the punishment but we have had the opportunity to talk about why they got it and how to change the behavior in the future . There is a ton of paper work , and there are law makers who come up with systems that make no since to educators , but fuck them. I love my job every day and I will do the paper work and deal with the shitty things because I am tankful to get to do my passion every day and have impact on the next generation. Best of luck to you.  




  He explained the similarities in his interview, he eventually became a manager and said it was very similar to managing a classroom , and that is why he was so successful at it. Just some things to consider before making the switch, pros the money is much better, their are certain perks that come with the job(company trips, nice dinners, and networking ), the down side its that every year is like your first year of teaching, my dad worked 70 hours a week most weeks. The company sets your sales goals and they always expect you to keep inflating sales even if the market is saturated. Another thing to consider is that in recent years drug companies have come under scrutiny and therefor aren't allowed to do a lot of the things that used to make the job fun ( bring doctor offices lunch, take doctors to see speakers , take nurses out to dinner ect) there is a lot less fluff than their used to be. My dad worked for the company for 20 years and has a nice retirement. My mom still works for a different drug company (she was also a former teacher) she said that now they like to see people with a science back ground, so if you teach any STEM classes I would say you have a good shot, also most drug reps would be happy to let you shadow them one day, to get a better idea of what it is like. My dad said that he missed teaching because of the human factor, a couple years before he retired, he started helping out with high school wrestling because he missed working with kids. hope this was helpful , best of luck to you  




 I was a bartender before I was a teacher, the best thing about bar tending is you can't take your work home with you. It took me about 3 years to get into a bar position that I really liked, (most busy bars want a few years of experience) but I made amazing friends had a ton of fun, and made damn near close to what I make as a teacher.  




 I think what set me apart is I have great resume and interview skills. I also dress very well, which seems trivial but getting hired is all about first impressions. One of my friends got hired because they had coached basket ball and the school needed some one to take over JV. 
I think it would be unlikely that a school would hire you before student teaching, and honestly you wouldn't want to teach before you student teach. Student teaching is really where you gain most of your skills like classroom management , non instructional routines, and how to handle your work load. 
Does your school offer certification before student teaching? 




 I have always had a theory that most great teachers burn out around 10 years, because teaching is a hammer of a profession and if you are giving it your all, then it isn't sustainable for most people. I admire you for recognizing that you need a change and not becoming one of those teachers who "don't teach" , or takes their anger out on their students. Both my parent were teachers and my dad left after 15 years and became a drug rep. Drug companies like teachers because they are good at learning information , and explaining it. So maybe give that a shot, best of luck to you .  




 I cater waiter a couple times a week , it is nice to have some extra cash and because I bar tended my way through school it is easy work. I go to the gym a lot, and I volunteer at the suicide hotline. Take some time and go visit family and friends that you haven't seen in a while, often times i am so busy during the year that I don't get to spend much quality time with the ones I love. Hope this helps! 




 I would suggest that if you haven't started your content area that you look into math, special ed, or science. These areas tend to have more job openings , I received a MAT is secondary social studies and was one of 3 teachers who got hired before the school year started. Most of my grad school friends are subbing or considering going to teach ESL in Asia. If I could do it over I would have gotten a degree in special education. 
To answer your second questions most MA programs have student teaching as the last course before you graduate. It is nearly impossible to get hired anywhere without student teaching, even if you have a certificate, most employers want to have an idea of what you are like in the classroom.  hope this is helpful feel free to message me any further questions. 




 I too had an awful experience with k2 I smoked some after a night of partying with friends ,at first I just felt high then really parinoid, then my thoughts felt completely splintered. I felt absolutely insane I was with friends and didn't want to freak anyone out so I went into the back room and laid in the fetal postion for hours my friends came to check on me I couldn't speak in complete sentences. I was very worried that I had done permanent damage to my brian after 8 hours of feeling like this I started to feel better but it took about a week before I felt normal. K2 is horrible and should never be compared to actual weed. 




 Freakenomics suggested that part of the reason that crime decreased was because abortions became easily available after Roe V Wade, and because their we less unprepared parents, and everything that can go a long with that (poverty, less education, less resources ) their were less criminals produced. They used statistical information form the US and Romania to show the link between the availability of abortions and crime rates over the next 30 years.  









 Rule number 1 of being a vegan is bring your own food and bring enough for others to eat. It sucks to get picked on for wanting to live a compassionate life, the way I have handled it is by killing people with kindness. I never expect there to be anything for me to eat unless I am at my house. I keep dried fruit and nuts in my bag at all times just in case I get in a predicament. I very rarely mention to people that I am vegan. If people do know that I am a vegan and ask me a bunch of questions about what I eat I offer to bring them a vegan lunch the next day  a lot of people enjoy it and then asking for vegan options becomes more of a group thing and not just you "being a demanding vegan". I remind my self that becoming a vegan didn't happen overnight for me ,so I can't expect people to understand it overnight. 

TL;DR make some allies in the office , make them see veganism differently through your actions.

 I used to work at 24 hour suicide hotline, you would be amazed at the number of calls I would get on an over night where guys were trying to get me to have phone sex or get me to say things that they could jerk it to.  




 Bald men are sexy, from my experience they have a good since of humor, and are fantastic in bed. Own your bald head, if you wear a hat make sure to take it off at some point when you meet someone for the first time so that they aren't shocked or don't recognize you next time. 




 I too teach history, you are entitled to your opinion. But it really bothers me when teachers complain about their salary. You knew what you were signing up for and there is more than one way to get paid.  




 You must not be a history teacher. 




 I would hypothesize that life expectancy stayed about the same. Slave owners saw their slaves as investments and they wanted to keep them a live as long as possible. After the war the Union controlled much of the government regulation for the first few years, so lynching of freed slaves wasn't very prevalent. Most freed slaves had little education or skills, many became share croppers which is very similar to slavery.  




 How long some one had left to live , but they couldn't see it and no body could tell them , but every one would know. 




 When students slack off all quarter and then try and make up 9 weeks worth of work in 2 days , and bullys fuck that shit . I am pretty laid back but if you are rude to me or mean to another student I will bring the reckoning down on you. 




 It depends on if the gold bricks were redistributed from the gold that already exists or if new gold was some how made. If it was just redistributed and still held its value then it would close some of the income gap. If it was created  then it would become devalued.most likey used for electronics. It would not effect fiat currency , because this money is separate from the value of gold, and the  government it what determines the value. It would proably have a negative effect on any gold based currency 




 I have a bachelors  and a masters degree both from regular university to get an addional certification in my field I took two online classes , they were no were near as difficult or engaging as the classes I took in a real classroom. I don't feel like I learned as much from them, based on my experience if  someone had a degree that was done completely online , I wouldn't consider their education to be as thorough.
 




 I would say it is not a good first date question, see how it goes maybe you'll hit it off maybe you wont, and if you don't no need to ask. i think most women who aren't trans would be somewhat offended if they were asked , and then you become one of those "worst date ever stories" 




 What are you contributing, to the causes that you hold dearest to your heart? Made me change my career. 




 that is an good point 




 One of my best friends is transgendered, and she feels like it is dehumanizing to ask if she has had surgery to become a woman. She said if you wouldn't ask a non transgendered person about their genitals why is it acceptable to ask her. I also know that she is very open with everyone she dates that she wasn't born in a woman's body. I would get to know the woman if you like her keep dating her and she will probably tell you about it when she is ready. If she isn't trans then you'll most likely find out when the relationship becomes physical. If you aren't cool with dating someone who is trans then maybe you could bring it up in conversation with her and gage her reaction with out straight up asking her. But if you are cool with dating someone who is trans, then just keep dating if things are going well and like most secrets she will tell you when she feels she can trust you. To me it sounds like you find her attractive and like her enough to ask her out again so why are you letting your friend mess with your head ? 




 what artist would you like to see cover one of your songs?  




 I was a bartender for a long time , so I've hear pretty much everything but a guy came in one night kept ordering whiskey on the rocks, and then he ordered a red headed slut, I brought him the shot. then he said "I wasn't talking about the shot I was talking about you" and put 200$ down on the bar, and his hotel key. (I guess I should mention I am strawberry blond) Still grosses me out to think about it. 




 He's running a marathon, I follow a blogger who snapped this photo. Here is the link with an interview with the guy pictured for those interested.

 There are plenty of intellectuals who smoke. I have a masters and most of the people in my career field are well in formed educated people. Most of us smoke weed in moderation. We hang out, cook dinner, play music, talk about societies issues, and laugh really hard about silly things. It can be a great tool to unwind and relax with friends. I completely agree that stoners, like any one who abuses a substance give it a stigma that I wouldn't want to associate with either. 

tl;dr find cool people to smoke with instead of stoners
