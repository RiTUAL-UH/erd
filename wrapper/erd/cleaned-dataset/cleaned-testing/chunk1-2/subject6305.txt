 Thanks, that was really clear and easily understood. The video also helped a lot. 









 I met him as well. I was really young, 5 or 6 maybe and he was shooting a movie near where I lived so my dad brought me over there and told me  "That's the Genii from Aladdin!!". I, being a 5 year old, immediately ran over to meet him. As I was running over, a van with some sort of film equipment was coming by and was going to hit me. Robin yelled at the same time as my dad for me to stop. Robin Williams saved my life, then afterward, we had a little conversation about watching for cars. Meanwhile, my stupid older brother sat in the car and listened to music.
