 I would rather have a friend who has problems with self pity than a friend who had a dark triad personality with no self pity. 




 Using a blue spectrum hydroponic grow bulb is the solution to treating MRSA infections. Treated my last three infections this way.  




 You too buddy. Over and out.  




 Thanks for link. New to redditt. Love it. Find smart and weird people. 




 Language is the greatest invention of mankind but it is also our biggest brainwasher. I like to close my eyes and think of ideas, abstract concepts,and thought experiments through visualization.
It uses a different part of the brain than language
 This overcomes the limations and creative blocks that language puts my the mind under. I invented several ideas with  this method. Tesla use to do this. Would be neat , but not sure how possible, if in the future visualization could be incorporated into language. 









 Forgot what we where talking about.  Where you talking about bypassing laguage or entering black hole to another universe in the next couple hundred years? 




 Have an abstract idea how this could be done. 




 That is near black hole not in black hole. LoL. Do you think black holes could be connected to other universes. Known Quantum math doesn't work in Black holes so I am asking questions just to ask questions. Have any crazy ideas.  




 I know stupid question but a least I understand topic a little. 




 Thank you link. I will check  it out.
 




 Good response. I should have made question with out serious.  I think maybe our universe it connected to a black hole of parent universe. Not sure. Just crazy idea 




 Who is Jayden? New to reddit. Is this inside joke. 




 I think science is wrong. It is not cause and effect but causes and effects. Science is the best we have but don't sell me that the cause and effect solution 100% reflects the real world. I call science a "good enough" tool. Correlation is not causation. 




 Language is flawed. 




 Is there time in a black hole?

 




 Good answer. Just making sure you where not a fundamentalist. 




 I am 99% sure of many things but am not 100% sure of anything. 




 Is that your opinion you seem so sure you are correct. Half my mind says yes the other half no 









 I think the way to fix our campaign finance laws is for there to be a law that states only a US citizen can give money for the campaign of his/her district. Why should someone like Donald Trump, the Koch brothers, or George Soros be able to give to a represative of Montana. Also, these donations should be made Public record. No donations from international organizations like corporations or unions allowed.   




 On behalf of the President of the United States and a grateful nation...

 




 Let out the inner animal.  




 Is it in Japanese. 




 Your a superstar in your own mind. Live for the moment. You and millions of fans in your head. 




 Got too love it when a guy is home alone crying while watching lifetime movies. 




 Go white girl 




 Don't apologize but if that is the case I feel sorry for you. 




 Good one. 




 What type of dance? 









 It increases blood flow to the infection. This increases white blood cells in area of infection.  




 Cool, thought this was my idea. If we could only get another visionary President like Kennedy we could make this happen. Thank you for link. Going to check it out. 




 As long as this country had mandatory exercise and heathy eating. 




 When the law is lawless you have a civic duty to humanity to break it.  




 Yep. You understand the idea.
 




 Good one. LOL 




 Well said. New to reddit. People seem smart here. I think I might have found a new addiction. 




 Show zero fear. Then calmly say, " Go ahead, but you will spend the rest of you life in prison if you go ahead with this". Most killers are physchopaths and enjoy inflicting pain on emotional people. You have to show no emotion and remind him what will happen to him if he goes ahead.  




 I would say odd are that this is not true but this idea would not go against quantum physics.  




 I would say most likely no also but I had a crazy dream where in my dream I thought this was true. In my dream, I realized that the moment of the big bang was the moment of formation of the black hole of parent universe.  




 Crazy talk or possible? 




 In the future, 3D printing will be useful in making  space structures in orbit around the earth. Printing a bridge is a cool first step toward using 3D printers for use in building structures in orbit, the moon, and mars. 




 How can it be a "leaked" document. I think this language is a little over the top. The term "leaked" is primary used  to describe documents that are given to the public that contain things that organizations or governments want to keep secret. Not the church's pre-mature release of doctrine, policy, or future speechs talking points.  




 It is about truth in advertising and freedom of choice. I don't care what the expert opinion is on GMO's.  Many health related issues that where considered fact in the past  are now called into question. Also, the genes of humanity are not monolithic. Some people have rare adverse reactions too things of which the reason is not currently understood. For this reason, labeling and having GMO free places too eat like Chipotle is a good thing. 









 I wonder if a food company could breed these ants, grind them up,   extract the chemical that produces this smell, and then use it as a food additive. Never know, someone might convince high society it is the new status symbol food additive.
 




 Many people say " I don't do anything wrong so why should I care".
There was a film about east germany when it was communist. In the movie, one of the local party bosses had the hots for the wife of one of the films characters . He told the secret service to spy on him to find some "dirt" on him so he could lock him up and have his way with his wife. He couldn't find anything so he used the private information of his phone conversations to frame him. 
" Power corrupts" and " absolute power corrupts absolutely ".
So get a warrent unless you want to live in a police state. If you don't think this couldn't happen in the United States your fooling yourself. Would you like all your phone calls keep in a central database where even your local sheriff could listen to them. This is where this is heading in the future if not stopped. 




 So does intermittent fasting.

 The growth curve of solar is similar to the graph shape of moore's law in computer computation speed. 
























 In the 1980's, KFC use to be good. 




 I think you are correct. Wow. 









 Wonder how much this fancy VCR was in today's dollars. Good askredditt question. I want inflation factored in.
  




 Y2k. Oh wait. That was over a decade ago.  




 You going to fix it 









 Don't need too understand the language to get the point. 









 I used a combination treatment of 400nm blue spectrum light from a hydroponic grow bulb, a topicial mixture of bezethonium cloride and epson salt, and alternation hot and cold. Each of these ideas have some known medicial benefit and are covered in peer reviewed scientific papers. My idea was to combine all three and get the 400nm blue spectrum light from a 1000 watt hydroponic grow bulb. Treated my last three MRSA infections  this way.  









 Someone should talk about the lady who helped these dogs. Bravo lady.  




 Please be civil people our furry friends would want us too be.

 




 If China can regulate population through there one child policy surely they can regulate the treatment of dogs. They lack the political will. The west should force policy change and connect trade agreements with policy change.  




 There was a scientific study that concluded that for every dollar we spent on NASA we received over 9 dollars on long term GDP growth. 




 This is a perfect example of why we need to fund large national scientific projects. This is why we need visionary leadership who understand the long term return on investment on projects like CERN.  









 They are brother/ sister. The black one is the girl and the white one is the boy. They both had worms really bad when I rescued them. After a couple of visits to the vet, they are both currently ok. 




 Who cares. They have nothing better to think about. How about thinking of ways to bringing manufacturing back. We need a visionary
President like Kennedy. 









 Brother/sister littermates  




 Enjoy the pic.  














 Interesting article but not sure this will work. 




 I want one! 









 These pics put me in a happy mood. 




 Favorite comment of the day. It paints an awful mental picture.

 Good positive story. 




 Kitty need some love.  




 Work of love. 




 Does not look good. 




 Please do and give me the results. Google 400nm light and look at the peer review research. It is called blue light therapy. It is already FDA approved for the treatment of acne. 




 I used three ideas that are known to have some useful benefit but when combine together work amazingly well for me. I am trying to get the scientific community interested in idea. Don't want any money. Jonas Salk style. 




 Yes it is a combination of three things. I invented it myself. Check out link. http://mrsafoundation.com/matthew-mcpherson/ 




 There is peer reviewed studies that say that 400nm light may help kill MRSA. I am the first person too think of using a grow bulb to produce this type of light.  Works like a charm. 




 It is a blue spectrum grow bulb when used in conjunction with bezethonium cloride treated my last three mrsa superbug infections. I am not joking. 









 Please no trolling  









 Yea and he will save 100 million in labor costs over the next 10 year from lower payed undocumented labor. 




 Good news.  




 Kefir drink 









 Super creppy. 




 True. Balance is hard in today's world. I just don't like to follow absolute advise. Life is messy but that is ok.  




 In my opinion, the body language is different in a dark triad and sometimes the eyes are a tell. 




 Dark triad personality people think normal emotionally healthy people are fools. What they don't realize is that they are the ones who are emotionally defective not humanity.  Sure the dark trial is better than average with logic but the universe is not governed solely by linear cause and effect logic. The emotion of love transcends logic.  




 But many caring genuine people are charismatic and caring. Can you tell right away or does it take time. If you can, how.
