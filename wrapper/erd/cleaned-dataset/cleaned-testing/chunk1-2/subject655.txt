 Sometimes I open the box and start eating while I'm still digging in my pocket for the check... 

I still pay pizza in checks for nostalgia....   (i tip the driver in cash fuck anyone who doesn't)

 I just remember all the news channels (except for NBC) were citing polls that justified Romney winning highhandedly.  

I remember being so stressed about him winning too.  I was sweating at the voting center wondering how many dumb fucks around me were going to vote for him.  

 I ate up all the predictions and was distraught hahah.  Maybe others were too and that's why they went out and voted.

 To be fair he didn't exactly run up against an awesome opponent.   He ran against weak candidates.   

SO...... pretty sure an adopted Detroit crackhead could have beat Mondale.   




 Yes he did.  The war was officially over.  He didn't give a fuck that the south rejoined the union and he burned his way from through Atlanta to Savannah.  

He was a crazy murdering fuck by the end of the war.    




 Dick Cheney's little Halliburton/KBR all killing our troops with open burnpits where they burned plastics, tires, metal, DU, medical waste, chemical barrels....

The did it upwind from the where everyone slept.  

24 hours a day there was this thick black smoke, making people cough up blood.  Some got cancer and some died of neurological problems.  Thousands upon thousands upon thousands of us breathed that shit every day.   

There is a lawsuit against them right now for that shit.   Just google Halliburton KBR open burn pits Iraq.    

Everything dick cheney touches becomes black and evil like him.    




 At the time all the polls were reporting a big defeat for obama.  And afterwards everyone was all blither blathering didn't know what happened..... 


And we still use those pollsters as "legitimate" today.

 I masturbate once in the morning and once at night.  Sometimes my SO helps... sometimes not.

At night it helps me fall asleep.  

in the morning  I seem to be in a better mood and less irritable during the day.   This has lead to great increases in my job performance.   

Jerk it twice a day, dudes.  You know... so you can win.   




 It's a shame really.  CA is so beautiful usually.  

I was just making a side of the mouth joke about drought in CA.    









 If you get into nova settings (which just change settings in the stock developer menu) you can change the speed at which it runs.   

I run with no eye candy, which just turns all the animation and transition scales to 0 in the dev menu.   

There is no cool graphical changes but it is very poppy.    

That's just my experience.  Sorry it doesn't work for you.   




 Are you into modding and roming?   

My nexus 5 is great batt life for me but I have heard of others having problems. Usually those people are just running stock.

Nexus is great for having fun flashing...  Just kinda boring outside of trying out the latest CM rom.   
 




 sitting here turning it off and on I can see a HUGE difference.   

Like a couple of seconds. (timer says 1.6 sec)  Both my exynos and snapdragon respond the same.   




 I regret nothing.  I made my choices and took the risks.  The government should say thank you by fixing me up.   They will... just have to slap them around a bit first.    




 To speed up the task switcher .  


Go to settingsapplication manager.    Swipe over until you reach the "All" list.  

Scroll down until you see an app called "talkback".    Turn that app off.   

It won't entirely eliminate the lag but it will half it.      

Also, roll the nova launcher.  You'll still have touchwiz features but without the slow jerky touchwiz launcher.    




 Bro... this isn't XDA, most people here barely even know what root is.   Much less how to get a custom recovery (if their bootloader is unlocked *cough usa phones cough*) and flash a kernel. 




 Oh bull. Both my Exynos and my Snapdragon ran like shit after LP.  I factory reset one time after that upgrade and it's been great after that.  

I don't even wipe between rom flashes.  I just dirty flash and it still runs great.  

Everyone has to do ONE little factory reset after a major update and they act like their phones never work.   Get a grip people.  




 Blame the userbase.  Everyone was screaming and crying about getting Lollipop that samsung released 5.0.1... when it should have told everyone fuck you, wait, and delivered 5.1.1.   

This phone deserves nothing less than that.   




 I'd say no if you're on the Note 3 or S5.  

Don't get me wrong the note 4 is AMAZING... but the difference between the note 3 and 4 isn't THAT amazing.  

Now the difference between 4 and 5 [rumor].... that's worth waiting for.    




 Holy S__T! Is there any way we can make this kid stop trying to make nickle sized blackholes????  




 How many of those people, after spending the money, felt jipped?   




 This and honest this.  

People with weak hardware can stay on WoW..... but computers and games have passed outdated WoW by.  

Make wow 2.   Give us a 3D globe map that navigates like google earth.   

Give us graphics updates.  and more in depth customizable character building. 

Even if they got started today, we wouldn't see anything for 5 years.    




 Yeah nothing keeps you in the starting area.   Although I think I did level up from exploration xp on the way there.   

Which made me ahead of my friend.   In hindsight, I think there is a way to freeze xp gain...  




 Is there a drought there?

 How likely would the delegates go against the results of the vote?    




 Revenge is just harming another to make yourself feel better.   So no I don't see any difference of harming another for satisfaction against harming another for satisfaction.   

If it was about justice you'd just put him down pain free with argon and nitrogen gas.   

You haven't yet expained why torture should be a requirement leading up to his death.   

Which means this isn't about his death or justice.   This is only about his torture.  And why would someone want to see another be tortured?   For personal satisfaction..... harming another to satisfy internal emotional desires.   

It is EXACTLY the same.   

Good day, crazy.  I'm turning off inbox replies now.    




 How's it feel to to dishonestly obfuscate in order to defend being a psychopath?    




 

Have fun being a psychopath.  Get help.  I'm serious as a heart attack when I tell you that.   Please.... seek.....help.    




 Yes.  A quiet, painless death.  Argon and Nitrogen.   Doesn't take long and then its over.  The person being executed doesn't even feel like they are dying.  

Justice served.  Bury him at sea.     




 That's an excellent point!   Just one question though..... what?  




 http://i.imgur.com/BQG1bIw.png 




 Or the nitrogen argon gas... quick... painless.... he doesn't even realize he's going.  

Then it's over.  Justice is served.... and no one is getting sick thrills off continued brutalization of another.    




 LOL Have you been on reddit lately?  It's always one extreme or the other... no one ever has any middle ground opinion.  

So when someone comes out and says it, it's nice to hear.  I know I'm not in some sort of singular existence... but there are so many here that are all "booo fucking hooo death penalty is always bad" and the others that wanna kill people for lesser crimes.  

SO... yeah... its nice to hear it every now and again.   

 




 I'm saying it doesn't fucking matter.   Because the person doing the  act is getting the personal satisfaction they desire from it.   

Money doesn't make it worse or better.  You're already as evil as you can get by sucking enjoyment from the pain of another.  Nice try on the obfuscation though... it was a really big stretch there, Armstrong.    




 Brutally harming another for personal satisfaction.   Nope they are both the same.   Have fun at the doctor, nutso.   




 Oh so money, not personal satisfaction makes it worse..... duh okay.  

Have fun being just as sadistic as him.  I don't know how you can find help for that.  See a doctor.    




 I love all the comments where people want to do all this fucked up shit to the man.   

So you're exactly like him then?  You just do sadistic fucked up stuff because they deserve it or you need to satiate some personal need for satisfaction?  


Edit: Too many strings of the exact same debate so I'll just put what I said here.  I'm done now thanks for the debates.   

Revenge is just harming another to make yourself feel better. So no I don't see any difference of harming another for satisfaction against harming another for satisfaction.
If it was about justice you'd just put him down pain free with argon and nitrogen gas.
You haven't yet expained why torture should be a requirement leading up to his death.
Which means this isn't about his death or justice. This is only about his torture. And why would someone want to see another be tortured? For personal satisfaction..... harming another to satisfy internal emotional desires.
It is EXACTLY the same.


As long as we continue to enforce our laws, by utilizing the same behaviors as the criminals themselves, we will see nothing other than the continued perpetuation of these types of events within our society.   

We must rise above our gnashing teeth and primitive selves if we are ever to make progress as a civilized people.   

Edit2: The arguments that "they deserve it" or "they are a monster" or "it is justified" are the same arguments that the government used to defend it's torture practices.  Looking at ISIS we can definitely say that those practices made life MORE violent for us.... not less.  

By allowing this sort of brutalization you say to the government that it is justified to use whatever means it desires to assert it's will.  And thus you have a society feeling more like it's them vs the government.  And most certainly the government will feel the same and will respond accordingly to protect itself.  

"Escalation of the situation" from the top down is what's destroying our society.  It permeates itself in our cops and criminals, in our political debates and our legislation.  

This shit's got to stop.    




 How's it feel to think exactly like the man you're killing?    




 Finally!  Someone who is like me. 

I'm not against the death penalty.   I'm against killing innocent people.  And we keep managing to kill innocent people using the death penalty.   So lets stop doing that until we can figure out how to institute a system where ZERO innocent people get executed.   




 What is that game... five nights at freddy or something... I can't see these character without thinking of that.

Other solutions are nerve blocks... those are temporary, risky, and I don't care to have more needles shoved in there.  

The solution is to remove my useless finger, and the muscle groups that are causing the pain.   I'm not using them... get rid of it so the pain goes away.   

I'll still have phantom limb... but all the other more terrible side of this pain will go away.

 When something is so sad that you can only laugh.   WTF I hate that.   

North Korea is still around because it makes communism look bad. And the USA likes that because as long as communism looks bad, China is de-legitimized.   




 puh... "minerals"   we got minerals every where else.  

They got oil?   




 We can easily shoot down korean technology missles.   So I think I wouldn't worry about that.  

Their artillery is very visible to satellites. And any type of fortified bunker they have our bunker busters can easily penetrate.  We can launch from ships, from planes, from stealth bombers.   

Our missle defense systems are a lot more advanced than we let on.   

I'm sure South Korea has developed plans to minimize civilian deaths after living under the threat of attack all these years.  No doubt alarm signals.   

So I think it would be over very very fast.  

It's not like fighting scattered terrorists.  Against a nationstate our military will dominate.    


































 I gotta say this place is dangerous as hell for motorcycles.   It is anarchy on the pothole filled roads out here and the massive yellow Bachelor Bus owns every bit of it.   


Thankfully, my accident today was just minor and DID NOT involve a Bachelor Bus passing a tricycle cab around a blind curve.   

Instead I got T-boned.   Fucked my leg up a bit and bent my foot peg flat.   I really really don't understand how I did not drop the bike.  

He decided the man stopping at the intersection of two highways had no good reason to do so.   Instead of considering the possiblity that the other vehicle may have stopped for oncoming traffic, the driver passes around him and shoots on into the street.   

I saw him shoot out at the last second.  I really did not want to get hit at an angle... especially with an oncoming truck that was overloaded with Copra.   I preferred going onto his hood instead of over it and onto the pavement.  Luckily I was rewarded with neither after jerking the bike into position.   I really don't know if that was the right move or not as I've only been riding on road for a year.   But it worked out.   

My back tire got busted from the lateral push on it... 

I just have a bruise on my leg that hurts a bit when I walk.    No bones broken, but metal part on the bike crushed.   Not sure how my leg isn't broken... or how I kept the bike up.  

But his front bumper got completely torn off.   Good that fucking retard.   Idiot then tried to fit the bumper in his back seat and couldn't figure out why the doors wouldn't close with it in there.   After threatening to call the cops and cursing his dumb pinoy ass out, he decided that throwing the bumper in his open trunk and speeding away was a good solution to his problem.   

I got the footrest peg sort of straightened out, but it'll never be the same.    

My poor little shitty Yamaha SZ.....  

After being forged in the fires of Anarchy and shitty road conditions, riding in the USA is gonna be a cakewalk.    Hope I don't get complacent.    

That fuckers car got fucked up  Good for him.... dumb piece of shit.    


All gear, all the time for me......  I'm gonna get the hard shin guards now.  









 [The 22nd amendment is worded that someone cannot be ELECTED to the presidency twice.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)   But can they ascend to the presidency.   

For example, if Obama was elected to the House of Representatives, and voted as Speaker of the House, and then both the president and VP are killed....  

Would he still be within the confines of the constitution.   

(it should be noted this is NOT wishful thinking.)   




 I've been living in very poor rural area of the Philippines for over a year.   No mirrors here and no need for one because you're just gonna be dirty, hot, and sweaty.

Ugh... 




 Public schools failed me by teaching incorrect comma usage as correct. 

They neglected the semicolon;  is it a period, comma, or period/comma hybrid? 

The Harvard comma; I've been taught is correct, incorrect, or doesn't matter.   

In public school I was literally told that parentheses are just the evolution of commas.  


Two spaces after period?  "Only when handwriting."   ..................... sigh.



Numbers :Was told only write it out if there is already a digit in the sentence.     


And of course when I took grammar in college the professor just said he didn't care about grammar because no one knew how to do it.  

After 3 weeks of learning nothing I just Clept the course credit.   No I STILL don't know, but have the credit that says I do, and that generally makes me a useless human being.  Because of this I am now against clept.  

Oh and I get corrected by grammar Nazis all the time but a lot of times they are wrong too so it doesn't help.  

Is there like a free online course somewhere that can help me???   I'm an approaching middle age and haven't the slightest clue.

 ++So I chose to use Chrome instead of the built-in browser.  The built in browser has full screen.  AFAIK chrome does not have a fullscreen setting... at least not one I can find.   

Well I really regret my decision now because the screen is now burned where the status bar is.  

I am now using the stock browser... especially on white screen you can see the "off white" of the main screen with a crisp very white bar where the black status bar is.  But the effect is very visible in landscape like while watching a movie or playing a game.....

I've tried several apps that claim this can be undone.  But none have worked and probably never will.  I spend many many many hours a day reading the Internet.  So the burn is likely permanent.  

And of course I'm Knox 0x1. 

Word to the wise... use fullscreen browsers if you are extremely heavy user like I am.  


Edit:  here is pic.  Also why would you down vote this?  I clearly stated this is entirely my own fault and did not act like the phone is the problem.

This story is a bit long so you may want to grab a snack and a drink.  


We will call her Jenny for this.   


When I first met Jenny, she was my girlfriends best friend.  My girlfriend accused me of having sex with Jenny, and broke it off.    I DID NOT have sex with her.  I was struggling with my own sexuality at the time.  I had not been having sex with my girlfriend for some time.  My girlfriend made this accusation upon returning from traveling to Alabama with her ex boyfriend.  I'm not stupid; they fucked.  And more power to them... I certainly wasn't doing it and had to think about dicks to even try.   Yep... I'm gay I remember realizing.   I remember telling myself, Fuck it who cares just be gay, dude.


Anyway.  Jenny and I became good friends after this ordeal.   When I met Jenny she seemed mature beyond her years but that maturity came with a child like innocence.   Sometimes objects would entrance her.  She would examine it closely and pick out the smallest details and appreciate their beauty.  All this while having reddit open, and learning about particle physics at the same time.   Oh and don't forget the octopus hat.  


I loved her so deeply.  In a non-romantic way.  


Jenny had problems in her past.  Her family was not very supportive of her.  I think they just didn't know what to do.   Jenny dropped out of highschool,after an off the record meeting with the school counselor; in which she was advised that she should do so.   The school didn't know what to do with her either.  Later I encouraged her to get her GED (good enough diploma) so that she could at least get into a local college. In order to take her, I got fired from my job for calling in sick and not providing a requested Doctors note.  Fuck that job anyway, this shit was important.   


Jenny was highly, highly intelligent.  She could figure anything out. She absorbed all available data that she could.  Johnny Five seriously yo.    


Jenny had problems socializing with others.  She liked big gatherings of people, but preferred to stay off to the side and observe while talking with the one or two people she felt comfortable with.   


After a while Jenny lost her job.  She was fired for poor customer service.   After that we did not have enough money to pay the bills.   And I detected agitation... or an increasing anxiety in her.   I knew she needed a doctor, but we had no insurance.    



So I said to Jenny, Why don't we just get married at the courthouse.  I'll join them military and you'll get medical insurance.  


And she agreed.   So that is what we did.   


At first it was great.  Jenny was excited about us moving.  Which was surprising to me because she did not like changes to her environment.   But she was okay with this.   


Then, I got deployed.... while I was away, Jenny began reading the news about the war.  Her agitation increased because she was completely dependent on me.   What would she do if I died?  Where would she work if she couldn't talk to people?    

And the news kept getting worse.  She kept reading all the links on reddit about government programs spying on us citizens.  About how people could hack into kinect and listen to what you're saying and watch you.   About how the government could tap into your cellphone and listen to the mic anytime it wanted.....  


Deeper and deeper into anxiety she sank.   Her ability to absorb data was astounding.  She would literally have hundreds of tabs open on her browser; and know what each tab contained.   So all this dark bad news she absorbed.   


When I got back, I discovered half completed wall paint projects all over the house.  I discovered unwashed gagging stink in the sink, of old ramen noodles, while the rest of the house was immaculately clean. 


The military medically retired me for the injuries I sustained from my time in Iraq.


She continued to refuse to see a doctor.   But after 2 years of random raging emotional meltdowns, she finally agreed to go.  Oh my goodness the meltdowns.  Her screaming and raging about how I shouldn't have a smartphone.  The government is listening.    She would bury her cellphone under blankets and insisted that we have double firewalls on the internet.   Oh and she smashed up the kinect and the entire Xbox after reading hackers could see you.   


The psychologist did some aptitude tests and other tests.  The psychologist called me in to discuss the findings.   Jenny was in the highest percentile for intelligence.  She should have been inventing fusion reactors.... 


But Jenny was also autistic.  Used to be called Asberger's syndrome but doctor said that was not a real thing and its just called Autism.     


The only experience I had with autism was meeting the cousin of a friend of mine.... this kid was in his own world and didn't talk.   But the doctor explained Jenny was had a high functioning autism.   


Around this time, I was to the point in my recovery that I wanted to use my 911 GI Bill to go to school.     Jenny had revealed that she just wanted a house in the mountains somewhere with no internet and lots of books.   The psychologist agreed that this might be the best thing for Jenny as her anxiety was virtually uncontrollable.   Jenny refused any type of medication.    

OK so I will go get that house in the mountains for you.   I needed to go to school and I wanted to work in ecology for national parks which are being overrun with invasive species of plants.  So I found a school that was perfect for me in Washington State.  

The psychologist explained that Jenny needed to learn how to be independent.  I agreed.  So I was given the okay by the doctor that Jenny would be fine if I left to go to school on the other side of the country.   The doctor said she would monitor Jenny closely, and have social workers check in on her at home.  


So I went.  I was gone for about one month.   The day before school was to start, Jenny had a massive meltdown.  Screaming over the phone at me how I abandoned her.   This hurt so bad.  I was doing this so that I could obtain the income to move her to the place she wanted in the mountains.  She kept screaming, FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!  FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!   And then she hung up the phone.   She had done this many many times before.  Often not speaking to me or answering my calls for days aftwards.    So I called the doctor and asked her to check in on Jenny.  The doctor said she would go visit in two days because she was out of the state.  The social worker was not answering her phone either.   

 

So I went to the orientation at the school the next morning.   Jenny was still mad;  not answering her phone.  


While washing my face in the bathroom I remember thinking, What if she killed herself?  


And then to my horror I said aloud, That would be a relief.   Then I cried for 20 minutes for having thought that.   I loved Jenny so much.  I just wanted her to be happy.  To recapture that innocence and wonder she had.   To live life without mistreatment from others.  I remember going and sitting outside her job at the mall and watch as the customers would abuse her.   


There was just something about the way she acted that invited people to scream at her and be rude.  I interfered with one telling the customer to back off.   Security then said I had to leave the mall and banned me.   Fuck them, those motherfucking asshat security fucks with their plastic badges and stupid hats they wear indoors.  That fat fuck couldn't see I was defending a family member against an aggressor.   Dumb fat fuck, with the front of his mall cop uniform untucked because his belly was jiggling below it like it was jello.    


I had to leave home because the orientation day was going to start.   So I went to school and tried calling every chance I got.   No answer.    But she's done this before.  I kept telling myself she would be okay.   


But that evening, I could not take it anymore.   So I called the police and asked if they would go check on her.   


The cop arrived at the house and called me on the phone.  He said there was no answer but he could see the rice cooker light on through the window and the car was still there.   


I told him to bust the glass on the door and enter the house.   He said okay and that he would call me back.   


Five minutes passed.   A goddamn eternity it was.   I called the cops phone.   No answer.   


Ten minutes passed.   Fucking cop won't answer the phone.    


Twenty minutes passed.   Surely its something really bad he found if he's not calling or answering his phone.    


So I call the neighbor.   Neighbor says that I better talk to the cop but its not good.    


With that information I tell myself.  Jenny is dead.   


Finally the cop calls.  He says,  I'm sorry sir I have to inform you that your wife is dead.   She hung herself.  The body is cold so we did not try CPR.  An ambulance is on its way.   We then hung up.    



I couldn't believe it.   I blamed myself for saying what I did that morning.  I thought somehow that is what caused this.   


Even though we were not sexually involved, we were still married and therefore partnered in nearly everything.  She was my best friend.  She was just an innocent bunny.   


I dropped from school, returned home to clean out the house.   And I saw it.... the hole in the wall above the closet.   And then I realized why I could not find my German Shepherd Dog's leash.   


Jenny hung herself with it.  And then I wept some more for about an hour.  Walking around the now empty house.  I was abandoning it.  I could not live there but could not afford to pay the mortgage and rent on a different place at the same time.   So I let it foreclose.   


But anyway.  I remember walking around in circles, in her bedroom, weeping and looking at the hole in the wall.    I just wanted Jenny back.  Sometimes almost believed that any second she'll come walking in while talking way too loud about some kitten picture she saw on reddit or showing me yet another printout of Einstein's face that she photoshopped onto a kitten.   


I cried like I never cried before. I was  slobbery, snot drenched, hot weeping mess.    And then suddenly it stopped.  And I was no longer sad but instead mad at Jenny.   


And I'm still angry.  It was just such a waste.  She was so damn smart.  Should have been giving gifts to all humanity with her scientific discoveries.   And she just quit life like that.   She didn't give a fuck about how anyone else would feel about her suicide and just left.   No note or anything left behind.   


What in the FUCK Jenny???????


And for 2 years I haven't told anyone about this anger or shown it.  I just say that I am glad she is not suffering anymore.  And I hope she's chilling with Einstein right now.


My life has moved on, I am now using my pension to do humanitarian work in the Philippines.  But dammit I'm still so mad at her.   I wish I could feel something other than anger.  Because I loved her and now she's gone.  She just fucking quit and left.  


So that's it.  Its off my chest I guess.   Not really.  I'll just bottle this back up and bury it inside like I always do.  I'll just press on with life and keep my anger a secret from everyone else.   And in private I'll say my usual, God fucking dammit Jenny.  What the fuck?    My prayer.   


TLDR:Please go fuck yourself, Lazy.   :p.  I asked nicely...


Edit:  what's with all the fucking hate mail?  I followed the doctors advice.  I also sacrificed my life to take care of someone who's family abandoned her.  I'm no saint... but at least I made sure she was fed, warm, and dry.  I gave her everything she ever asked for and more.  

If you don't have the fucking balls to say shit here for public scrutiny then you're just a chicken shit pansy.  Grow some balls.  (Wait no those are weak)  grow a vagina and then shove a watermelon out of it. Now you're a man.     Wait.... what?  Lol. 


Edit2:  writing this was incredibly therapeutic.  It's like something has been squeezing my heart and it just let go.  I cried for the first time since i was in the bedroom looking at the hole above the closet.  I will choose to be thankful for all the octopus hat wearing Einstein as a kitten moments.  I'm still not fully okay. .. probably never will be.  But at least the heart squeezing is gone.  Thanks reddit.   
 









 Furthermore, the magic full bars spot changes slightly throughout the day. The magic spot is always in the same spot is was at that time day previous.  So if it's afternoon, the magic spot is different than it was in the morning but the same spot it was the afternoon previously.  

At night the bars are full in every spot.  So maybe interference from the sun?  I know that increased sunspot activity caused problems with some communications.   But it can enhance some

 Ok so this happened over 20 years ago when I was in high school. 


I was a tad small for my age, not entirely bullied but physically I was inferior to all the other boys my age.  This would change later but I was a bit of a late bloomer.  Certainly, the size issue was a problem a few times in my New Orleans highschool.   I was one of the few white kids in the school.  So I always had to prove myself to earn respect.   And you did not want to find yourself without respect there.  


Biology class was about to begin so a couple of friends and I stop off in the bathroom.  The science hall shared this restroom with the special education department.  

In the restroom was a boy with down syndrome.  He had taken his pants entirely off, along with his underwear, to pee in the urinal.  

So my giggling friends dare me, "dude dude take his pants yo".

I immediately declined saying no way.  


Then they threaten me and say they will tell the whole school I'm a bitch and hang signs around the school saying the same thing.  

So reluctantly I agree to take his pants.   So I scoop up his pants and underwear and run straight out the bathroom and around to the exit door.  I threw his pants in the trashcan outside.   

Then I return to high fives and way-to-goes from my friends.


After all the laughter and celebration, I notice a teacher is agitated outside the bathroom.

  She yells inside, "Fake Name, it's time for class come out of there this instant!"  

Out comes this crying and moaning kid with a too short t shirt on, face smeared with tears, and nothing on from above his belly button down.  The entire body of students in the hallway laugh... at...him...


I was so ashamed.   I could not sleep that night.  The next day, an announcement was made asking for information in who stole his pants.    None of my friends ratted me out. 


I knew the right thing to do was to turn myself in and attempt to redeem myself through apology and punishment.  


But I thought that would make me even more popular for what I had done, because the news would spread who did it....  This was just a justification or rationalization for me being too afraid to get in trouble. 


Now, over 20 years later, I still feel just as guilty as I did that first night.  Solid in my guilt with the knowledge I was given an opportunity to turn myself in and make it right.  And I did not.  And I wonder if that scarred this kid for life.  If he ever recovered.  By his tears he clearly understood that someone was being cruel, for no good reason at all.  


TIFU??   No.  Today I became a real piece of shit.

 I'm sure this is adverse to the spirit of how reddit is intended to work; but I almost never sort subreddits by new.  Whenever I do, it feels like I am going through the pile of junk mail on Monday To find the damn letter I'm waiting for.  


So I focus only Hot or Rising. 

I will express my gratitude to those of you who do spend time upvoting on New items.  I often imagine you guys, down there in the dark filth, with a brassy saxophone playing and covered in pig shit; Madly shoveling through the piles of crap that just keep on pouring in...

For comments however, I love to sort new. I often find lots of good stuff there. 









 I'm in Southern Leyte Philippines until 2016.  There is absolutely nothing to do here except watch shitty bootleg movies.   In town there are several stores that sell DVDs such as "The Bruce Willis Collection".  The DVD, (that says Blu-ray at the top) will have 6 to 12 movies on it.  


These movies are always low quality of varying degrees.  Sometimes, I can make the pictures look a little better by playing with different interlacing; depending on the nature of the picture.  However, conditions can change between chapters; and I find myself clumsily picking different interlacing.  


So maybe someone can guide this ignorant fool.  Forgive me if I use wrong terminology while I attempt to describe. 


I need to know which interlacing is best for


1. When the edges are fuzzy.  (Yes I know about the sharpen edges settings and also the ones Nvidia ctrl panel)  sharpen edges can really fuck you when then image is blocky.  


2. When the image is blocky


3.  When the image Is noisy


4. Grainy images (like noisy but more like sand than snow)

5. Random pixelization. (Not like big stationary blocky but small random blocks that move with the image) 


I realize there will not be a magic wand that is going to magically turn this shit into 2K definition, but perhaps soothe the God Damn thing would be nice.

 1. Did you even read the 2nd amendment.  It clearly says "in a well regulated militia"

2. To be fair, internet, modern postal service, and the likes aren't really able to be used to deprive people of life.  

3. Yes... they wrote it exactly for that, I already said that more than once. except most of the threats at the time were bands of indians, and military units (both rogue units and enemy units). 

 




 Why?  Each amendment stands alone.   The wording of any other amendment has no bearing on the 2nd amendment.    

It clearly says "well regulated militia"   

That does [not] mean to our forefathers that people need assault rifles with shitloads of rounds in them.   There was no such thing as a machine gun when it was originally written.   To them. a firearm was slow... heavy... and not very deadly in a singular form.  It wasn't until entire miitary units, firing muskets together as one, that they became effective in bringing death.  

So you have to think... they didn't write the amendment with the idea in mind that one weapon in the future could kill far more people than 50 men firing muskets could.  They wrote it with the idea that communities could defend themselves without waiting for a military unit that could be weeks away (or never coming).  The idea was that public communities would own and regulate the weapons use... rather than allowing single individuals to build stockpiles of powerful weapons that were in no way managed by anyone other than that individual.   The forefathers were VERY MUCH about preventing any ONE MAN from holding too much power, but that MANY MEN TOGETHER (the people or the public) would hold the power.      




 The locked down devices prevent you from continuing to use your device on a new carrier.  So even once your agreement is done, the carrier still controls your phone.  So you paid money for something you don't fully own.  If you bought the non carrier unlocked model...you could still enjoy your device.   Many of the non carrier models have a wider range of bands they can use as well.    




 Triple shot u pussy.  And it has to be shaped like a boot for no fucking reason at all. 




 yeah but spread out over 30 sec 




 I always thought the 2nd amendment wording was strange.   To me it reads not as a right for every man to have a gun, but was the right for a civilian population to organize into a well regulated militia and stockpile arms for that militia.   

The supreme court had other ideas I guess.  

Edit: I'm not saying the supreme court is wrong in their interpretation.  I just think the original wording indicated a little bit more organization to owning weapons than simply straight up no checks or balance of power between individuals.    I don't think they wanted the GUNS GUNS GUNS dystopia the NRA (and their arms dealers support) would prefer having.    I say this as both a gun owner and member of the NRA. (which was a very different NRA when I joined) 




 Well it's too late for that now.  For all we know the manager could have been in on it... no matter what their gender is.   

Regardless, the store is in control of content which could be a legal liability for them.   So why not just delete it?  No proof anymore.  You can't sue when the police arrive and find zero evidence to your claims.  


Don't be a weak little shit.  When somone does this shit.  You go outside call the police and wait for them to arrive.  Don't challenge the violator because they'll just delete the pics.   YOu want evidence.        




 Why would you have NOT called the police immediately????  Way to go.  You're exactly the kind of victim he was looking for.  

Now it's a LOT harder for them to actually do anything about it.  Especially now that his manager gives him the heads up to delete it so that the store isn't liable.     




 Now this is what I was looking for..  Instead of "it just does" answer.   

Thank you for your great information.  I can now safely vote on this issue without feeling like my ignorance can do more harm than good.

 You don't buy the carrier phone.   You buy the unlocked models sold by third parties or Samsung itself.  

There is no bloatware on these devices.   




 The fact that it was a problem in the past makes the problems you illustrated more able to stand unresisted.   


SO I get a little miffed when I see people saying "This has been happening for a while" as if its just some small standard annoyance to our civilization.  When it should be MORE ALARMING that it's been going on for so long.   




 You're not buying a 2 year agreement when you buy a non carrier phone.   

And you don't have bloatware.  

You know why bloatware companies pay to reduce the cost of the phone?   It doesn't matter if you don't use their software.  They still make profit off the data the software on the phone is allowed to acccess.  

So no...it's not FREE.  They FORCE you to give them something.   And you don't even get a device you fully control in exchange or the freedom to change carriers with that phone once you're agreement is done.   So you don't own it.... you paid verizon to own your phone for you and tell you what you can and cannot do with it. And in this case... the carriers are telling people that their devices must not be secure. 

That's a big fucking expensive problem.


The money you save from not being locked into a contract alone is enough to cover the subsidized nonsense.   Before I quit that I couldn't get new phones.  Now, I pay my full price phones down in 6 to 8 months (sometimes less) and get an upgrade.   And my monthly bills for phone service have been about half on account of the buying power I gained from freedom.

 I'm in Southern Leyte Philippines.  Woman comes to me asking what she should do.  Woman is in her mid 50's and obese 

The wound was full of green and yellow puss before I washed it out with a bottle of saline from a first aid field kit.  

It took a good hour and half to get all the crap out of it.  I expected it to look a lot worse before I began cleaning the gunk off but here it is clean: 
http://i.imgur.com/fUN36HG.jpg

She says the wound is from Cellulosis.  She had this hole in her back for 4 or 5 weeks before visiting a doctor; who upon seeing the injury administered to her a pneumococcal vaccination as treatment.  Seems odd to me but I'm no doc so...  

(In a seperate case, this doctor gave a diagnosis of "weak lungs" to a 5 year old boy and placed him on anti-tuberculosis medication.  The boy was not recovering and during a visit to the emergency room was diagnosed and treated for pneumonia.  He recovered quickly at that point)

Back to the woman... After her vaccination she then came down with high fever and was generally unwell but managed to recover after 2 weeks of illness before coming to me.   

This is the wound now at 7 weeks old.   Is this something that needs to be stitched closed?  Do I need to transport her 8 hours away to the big hospital?  I don't really know what I'm doing... or how to bandage anything properly.  I just made a flat square of guaze and tape to keep it covered.  But I'm afraid the guaze will stick inside... eek.   

This is why I work Logistics.

There I did it in notepad.   It works.

 You misunderstood.  The wave is not pushing it back and forth.   The point of convergence between the two interstellar medium and solar wind is what changes; moving past voyager while voyager maintains is heading.  

This turbulent nature of the convergence of the two mediums is the most commonly expressed reason here.     


THe water and air simulation is just to visually represent the fluid dynamics that happens at the convergence point where the two separate mediums collide.    What the simulation shows is that the border between the two is turbulent and not just some instant border change. 

THAT'S IT.  It never LEFT as the media expressed it.  It just explains WHY the readings are occurring(and being misreported) while it passes through the convergence point.   

If you're going to refute a point, try not to change it entirely from what it is first.  Trying to act like I was saying it pushes voyager back and forth.... LOL   Never once did I say it was exiting and re-entering.  I only referred to its time spent in the turbulent convergence zone of the two mediums.

 He really is right.  I remember being young and having the perception of a song that I had been listening to on my walkman... and then have my view totally changed after having seen the video.

 True.  But the LOSS occurs from being locked into 2 year agreements and not being able to shift carriers as desired to take advantage of promotions.  

Also, the alternatives to subsidized (like edge) come with a huge hidden interest cost where the user pays MORE for the phone than it's regular cost than they would if they just utilized the interest rate on a credit card.   (not to mention the payment flexibility)

And then there is the added loss of dealing with problems caused by purchasing a locked down device that has bloatware on it and you're stuck with a broken device.  Sometimes the bloatware causes such huge problems with battery life the phone has to be replaced.   Again... time lost and time is money.  

If you are unable to afford a phone without selling your soul to a phone company for 2 years (or paying HUGE early upgrade fees) then you should not be purchasing a premium phone.   

The subsidized phones do two things.  Make 3rd parties free money and imprison customers to their carrier.   That's it.  (3 things if you count not being able to be fixed at home) 

Its much cheaper to buy it through credit card.  *And also many non carrier phone dealers will have payment plans on premium unlocked phones.*  Many of these dealers will forgive credit problems with a small downpayment.  Also, waiting to buy 4 or 5 months after release is a good way to get refurbished phones that are in brand new condition for a fraction of the cost.   




 If he checked and confirmed he should have broken up right then.  


There is no excuse to ever intrude upon a persons private space and snoop through their things unless their VERY LIFE is in danger.  

If it ended up she was completely innocent, then he is just some crazy snooper stalker guy.   How creepy is that?    




 What?  

Its wrong in showing how fluid dynamics work in a turbulent shockwave?  Uhhh no.  It was something shown at a Nye and Tyson talk to kids to get them to understand about theories behind how the shockwave works.   The water represents the interstellar medium of space.  The air blowing outwards represents the solar wind pushing it back.   

Is it EXACTLY what happens?   NO..... duh.   but it is good at showing some of the laws behind how it works.    

Next time don't just say "you're wrong" and walk out.  WTF is that????  




 The article was quoting a forensics investigator who stated that this was about how long it took for them to develop the exploits.    Which is true about... We see the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 being revealed today a huge exploit allowing remote access to data even if it is encrypted.  That phone is about 9 months old. 

No security is perfect.

[Source](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/03/25/291925559/your-smartphone-is-a-crucial-police-tool-if-they-can-crack-it)    

there was a longer article I am having a bit of trouble finding.  It appears some debates got out of hand and deleted.    




 Why would it change.  I stopped doing the subsidized thing with phones 2 years ago after reading a similar post.    

I SAVED MONEY.   That means i've been able to upgrade more often whilst my income actually went down.    




 Good to know.  Thanks! 




 Why would that be the answer?   

The answer should be to find out if she is cheating using less intrusive means.  It's not hard to figure out someone is cheating.  It's as simple as "i have to work today" when you really dont.   

The ends do not justify the means even if the ends justify an action be taken.   Two wrongs don't make a right.  Neither person here had any respect for the other.  So fucking break up and hopefully they'll both learn not to be dickheads in the future.   




 You can tell it's a frat samurai on account of the salmon colored armor.    




 Elsewhere in this subreddit is a whole discussion w/sources where they say they can.   

The police can just hook a device up to phones older than 8 or 12 months and unlock them because most have exploits by that age.  

The only ones they have to send to apple are new ones of which they get partial data from.  after about 8 or 9 months, exploits are developed and the police update their little tool. 


They don't need shit to get you data.  So it doesn't matter if you do fingerprint or iris or pin code... or what your legal protections are for them physically forcing you to unlock the phone.... it.... doesn't....matter.   They have your data if they want it.   




 People STOP BUYING SUBSIDIZED PHONES!   

All you get is a 2 year pain in the ass agreement that you can never be free from if you want to afford the upgrade.  

just buy the unlocked version on a credit card and pay it down in 4 months.   If you STILL can't afford it, then you should be doing something with your money other than buying a premium phone.  

There's a lot of places selling unlocked devices that offer financing too.    




 its because of the code it changes within the system processes or configuration files to allow itself.  Even if you remove the app, the separate code is there there able to be accessed.  

Now if the carriers didn't lock people's bootloaders down, everyone would have had a custom recovery installed and flashed a clean rom by now.  But once again all this hold handing the carriers do to "protect users" has actually put them at greater risk.   

And because the carriers have a real dick up their ass about letting manufacturers keep their devices up to date, a patch to fix it is just kicking it on the shelf at samsung.  Meanwhile the carrier just lets all their users phones shit the bed.   

We need the FTC to step in and say enough is enough.  Get the carrier out of the way.  All it needs to do is connect my call.  There is NOTHING about the software on the phone that will fuck that up.  The ONLY approval they should have over updates is when the update is to the radio.  But what's funny is, they don't even need to do that because unlocked users flash those all the time with no problems.  

There has not been a single case of modified phone software harming the network.  On the other hand, there seems be a shitload of locked down phones harming users going on.    




 You're on the exynos though... the article only lists the American carrier models as the ones at risk.  The international carrier free phones did not come with swiftkey.  Only samsung and google. (my 910c only came w/samsung)  swiftkey is different.  Swiftkey made a special bloatware version specifically for carrier model samsung phones.   This bloatware ended up being a bloated sack of ever expanding shitdemon. 

People, If you're on a carrier phone, and you were required to get it contracted to afford it... STOP DOING THAT!  Buy the unlocked versions only. Better to put it on a credit card and pay it down over 3 or 4 months than to get locked into a 2 year aggreement and no control over your own shit.    Don't let the carriers do this shit anymore.  People don't want bloatware for a good fucking reason and this is the biggest fucking one.    




 Accident warranty only covers it if you haven't voided your warranty, you are correct.  

People should just save that money and spend it on insurance instead.  ESPECIALLY if you root or play with bootloaders; you should have the 3rd party insurance.  its only 99 bucks to replace it if you brick it.   




 To be fair, it wasn't TRYING to kill humans.   It was just trying to fuck one of them.  Then it succeeded by using a bald lady to fuck Fred Jones.

 A good representation would be to take bowl of water and a straw.  Blow straight down softly until an indentation appears and grows slightly.   

If you observe the edges of this indentation expanded and shrink rapidly.  

The edge of the termination shock is sort of doing the same thing... which is where voyager is. It's not leaving just returning readings of the turbulent convergence point of the two medium of interstellar space and solar wind.     

It is caught in the turbulence of the edge.   

Edit: clarifications. 




 away from it.  




 No, you dote, Voyager is in the Gamma Quadrant.  Broccoli hasn't rescued them yet! 



 




 No.  

Because the people who can figure out how to do it will go to XDA or Rootzwiki and follow information that already exists.  

If you do it here, every derp in the world will try it, then fail... only furthering the cause the carriers have to continue locking this stuff down.

 Thus enters the Patriot Act and all that secret court shit. 

Apple cannot unencrypt the system portion of the device.  That requires your password as the key.   

The rest is not encrypted in the same manner and for whatever reasons likely to remain secret, Apple is able to respond to these warrants with retrieval of partial data.  

All these companies were required to keep backdoors in shit because of the Patriot Act.    




 Ahhh the height I saw the world as a child.... 

Thank you.    




 I don't think I can let it go for that.

 WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE WHERE YOU BUY UNDERWEAR?! WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?! UNDERWEAR IS UNDERWEAR! IT IS UNDERWEAR WHEREVER YOU BUY IT! IN CINCINNATI OR WHEREVER!! 




 If it is encrypted, they can get it unencrypted by apple with a warrant.   They don't get 100 percent of data but they get anything that is important.  TXT messages, phone records, contacts, and media files.   

They cannot get into the system of the phone though.   So they "don't get 100 percent"  




 The ends do not justify the means.

It'll stop you from drinking wine that has already turned to vinegar too.... 




 Staying together and making it work does not equal total trust again.  

No matter how long it's been.... it'll always be there.  In the back of your mind.    You can't unlearn it.   

You could spend 40 years afterwards in a completely blissful marriage.  And if the cheater were to go alone into a room with another female... or drive with one in his car... Or on his walk you see him wave hello to the lady down the street and she returns his greeting with a big sloppy tongue kiss....   you'd wonder.  and if you say you wouldn't you're a damn liar or a fool.   


Edit: All kidding aside. you'd still wonder even if all the actions were innocent.  You'd still wonder if you need to wonder.  Past experience guides future behavior.  You really don't just undo betrayal.    
 




 Even if they aren't cheating; once you stoop to secretly checking the other persons private things, the trust can never come back.   Snooping email, text messages, looking through their files, and combing through their internet history is wrong.  Don't do it.      

They could be completely innocent, and you're snooping through their things.   The relationship is over at that point because the communication is not there.  Neither is the respect.     




 Its clear she is a liar.  Not really sure how you could think anything else...   




 ok then.  thanks! 




 Girlfriends don't have to be ~~alive~~ real.


Edit:  Wait that looks bad.  I mean... get a doll or a fleshlight then.   They won't cook you eggs or cuddle but they are always awake and ready. 




 It would be worth it in the form of a tax write off.    




 wut?? 




 you can easily launch planes from an aircraft carrier.  

One problem though.... neither of those things are a canoe.    




 Yeah but this isn't the case because the amount the bar increases between each block is like a quarter of an inch. Soooo that's large enough not to be an illusion.    




 But he didn't already know what his girlfriends pussy smelled like? 

He was talking about it like he knew it was hers.  Like he was smelling it for the first time.  She was hot so he expected it to smell good and was surprised when it did not.  

  




 my blood type is AB 




 I love it when pure, simple truth makes me get that feeling inside I can't explain.   Its just.......   BOOM.     




 its too complicated.   

Just say, "These aren't yours?"   

When she says no...throw them in disgust, freak out and start washing your face.  

She already knows you were sniffing the panties.  Girls are too smart to believe all that complicated nonsense. The best lie is the simplest lie.  They will, however, believe that you're a doofus moron, pretty easily.   

Play the fool.  




 netflix should give their services away for free to hospitals everywhere.    




 Set your alarm 15 minutes early.  

2 fingers,  find the nerve bundle little ways down from your glans on the underneath side of your shaft.  Rotate fingers in fast circle.   Bust a nut in like 2 min.   Blow it into the tissue.  Then fuck your girl for the remaining 13 min while you still have morning wood.   

You already blew your load so... its whatever but she'll get off 2 or 3 times because of it so that's fun.   *Just don't put her in one of those I just got amazing fucked comas.*  She's got shit to do today too.   

The eggs she'll cook you while you're in the shower will taste amazing.    

Nothing can bother you at work that day.   Its like a fucking paladin shield.   And damn those eggs burp good.     




 yeah... if the only thing you have is to sit there thinking about how sick and uncomfortable you are, it's going to make getting better a lot harder. 

Keep the patient distracted at least.... it'll make everything else so much easier.  Rather than deal with a pissed up, uncooperative, angry patient..... 




 Dammit it was almost out and this post made it crawl back up.... 




 you know stuff....thats cool 




 Ah ok.  That makes sense then.  Thanks!   Reddit is neat.    




 Uh yes he was.  He created a whole type of warfare called ["hard war"](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/rethinking-shermans-march/?_r=0) that involved starving civilians to death and shelling innocent towns.  

He stripped the civilian population of food on his march... even though he had more food than his soldiers could consume.  They'd take it anyway.   

The only people he did not kill were the one's that got out of his way and allowed him to brutalize others.  If you resisted at all, say to protect your last remaining cow, you and your whole family were dead.  

So it's often said "Sherman's March did not include mass killings"   That's true.  Instead, they were precision targeted killings.  Personal vendetta killings.  A die in a fire killings.   Killings of the most desperate who's backs were against the wall.

Ultimately, [his idea of war](http://www.historynet.com/general-william-tecumseh-sherman) was to make innocent civilians suffer as much as possible before they died.  

Also, Sherman seeded the term, "The only good indian is a dead indian" as a shortened version of his original words ""The only good Indians I ever saw were dead."   

So yeah... he loved killing.  And he loved it to be close and personal.   [And he loved inflicting as much hardship and pain as possible before doing so. Because his desire was to "make them howl."](http://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/shermans-march)  




 I'm in Southern Leyte philippines.... we aren't exactly riding the bandwidth super highway here on a shitty Edge network that is commonly slower than 1x.   In town I can get H+.  But it's really only 2G speed.    




 Or like mixing abilities.  Of course you'll always have your pure builds.  But this everyone the same shit is stupid.  

And stop making encounters so that you HAVE TO have a specific class/build there.   The encounters should be dynamic to provide a challenge and an incentive to keep basic needs covered.... but let people get creative.  You might see some amazing shit happen during a boss fight then.  Instead of every single encounter being exactly the same, you're gonna have encounters change and evolve somewhat each time.   




 He talks too?  Awwww it's so ugly it's cute!    




 Which means what in regards to the Israeli problem?  Not diddly shit.    




 Check out this Trollololol 




 That's an excellent point.  Just one question though..... WHAT???  




 Oh so because one group is wrong then it's okay for the other group to be wrong too.  


Duhhhhh OKAY!  




 I kumbaya mother to fuck.    




 Remember when 1 hour photo came out?   At the time it seemed almost like instant reviewing the pic.
