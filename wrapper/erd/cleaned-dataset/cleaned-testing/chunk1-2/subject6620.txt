 Best looking vehicle with a Subaru badge on it. I've got to go back to [this] (http://www.motorstown.com/imgs/18020-subaru-svx-2.html) in order to recall any other Subaru as visually stunning.  




 You should drop Mendenhall. There has got to be another way to fill that roster spot with someone that doesn't register 0 each week. Time to start scoring some points, man. 




 Being that you're in Chicago after all [unlawful intent can be presumed] (http://thefiringline.com/library/blades/knifelaws.html) 




 Not the most exciting roster spot to add, but consider the Cardinals D/ST. They shut down Vick and the Eagles weapons last week, and are going up against a struggling Miami offense. 




 Livable wages   fair medical benefits would be the first of a number of reasons. Unionized commercial food workers can make around $16-17 per hour for the jobs that Walmart workers get paid $9-10 an hour for.  




 The ice rink at Millennium Park would be a great option in late November. Zoo Lights in Lincoln Park = free. Ride the Ferris Wheel if the two of you aren't afraid to shiver a little.   




 Perhaps the Gangster Disciples near Division   Pulaski should consider moving to a more friendly community. So many of their neighbors are of the insane/maniacal variety. 




 Any game that the Hogs play against the Wolves will either be televised on Comcast or MY50 for Chicago locals. The way AHL's scheduling is structured that's probably 8-10 games this season 




 Sometimes stickers come in cow shapes and chicken shapes too. That's protein for ya!
 




 Perhaps Cutler could be more of a said bitch if he went to play for the Wings and remained a mediocre defenseman on their squad until he is 67 years old. 




 This has got to be one of the lesser liked Illinois or Cook County cops. They gave him a 2004 Malibu! 




 Inappropriate. There is no way that the Pentagon is that close to New York!  




 James's turn:

 No brainer. Forte   Spiller/Martin could all start ahead of a wildly unpredictable Johnson. 




 I find it more offensive that the Canucks are #3. First, their logo can simply be classified as stupid. Additionally, the huge VANCOUVER letters are obnoxious. Lastly, they borrowed the color scheme from the 1990s Seahawks. #3? Seriously? 




 For most of the mid 90s until about 2006 these jerseys were about the only thing the Hawks had going for them.  




 What did the 911 call sound like?
 




 It's a bit crazy. I've thought about proposing some trades for depth. Trading away the guys that you drafted early makes no sense though. Why pick a RB/WR1 and not show the confidence to keep him on your roster? 




 Looked at the title too fast and thought "He bought steak at Giordano's!?" ...but hopefully this helps the owners get it together.  




 Guy is alone because of the Detroit Vipers jersey. 




 How the hell is Jamaal Charles on waivers in your league?
Seems like you're dominating a league of inexperienced players. Have fun winning. 




 Change Portage Park to Polish Park.  




 Svengoolie was at his best in those years that it aired @ 11pm on WCIU! 




 Saddest moment in Berwyn history: http://chicagoist.com/2008/05/03/berwyn_spindle_1.php 




 Gone are the days when the Wolves were the only independent club in the IHL; I miss that. It's partly said "business" and partly the growing emphasis on the AHL being a developmental league. It seems that the number of veterans a club is allowed keeps shrinking. 

But with an impending lockout there is a great deal to be excited about this October! The roster will be stacked, and Wendell has brought Haydar and Sterling back together too.    




 I second this. The wolves are more of their own entity than most AHL teams. 

As far as the Ice Hogs go... thanks for Andrew Shaw. Nothing else positive to say about that organization. 




 Terrible luck!
 
If you go to Velasquez   Sons they can replace a catalytic converter way cheaper than most. It was 2006, but I got one for $90 parts and labor.  




 Even funnier is the ad box on the tribune's page: 

"Single? Meet local older women for free!"
 




 AHL gets no coverage in the states either. Chicago Wolves are the only team that televises all of their games, and it's local coverage only.  




 Way too much credit being given to Americans with this. This is assuming that they know of at least 10 countries in this region and can identify their shapes. 




 AHL during the last lockout was damn good. Guys like Vanek   Cammelleri ,that normally would have made NHL squads, played and tore things up. I remember watching my Wolves get destroyed in the finals by a team that featured Patrick Sharp, Jeff Carter, Mike Richards, Umberger, Nittamayki, and more.  




 Since it is a 2-way deal they should be able to. 

The circumstances were different in 2004-2005, but young NHL players like E.Staal and Spezza went down to the AHL after playing full seasons in the NHL. 




 Not over Sproles. Even though Sproles may get less than 10 carries, he has the potential to grab ~8 passes and rack up big yardage. Gerhart my get the same amount of touches, but his ceiling isn't nearly as high.  




 For a 10 team league this is terrible depth at RB.  




 Satisfyingly evil-looking.  




 Is it? Shouldn't it be "woman's best friend." Not "women's"
Nobody is saying "men's best friend." 




 So I'll refine my question and eliminate the loaded term "genocide." 

What is the proper historical legacy of Japanese war crimes (and crimes against humanity) that included: mass killings, human experimentation, biological warfare, and undeniable torture during the time period I mentioned?

 This is really informative. I have found historian, Herbert Klein's book on the Atlantic Slave Trade very eye-opening in many respects to slavery's practice on an international level.

 Sometimes referred to as the "Asian Holocaust," some historians cite a number of ~30 million Chinese, Filipinos, Malays, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Indonesians and Burmese dead a the hands of Japan during this time period.

 Not a female, but I'm going to guess that women hate denim shorts the most. (on men)

Weirdly enough there are tons of denim shorts on women out there, why does this make sense?
 




 I've been a good sport and worn all of the clothes that my girlfriend buys me. Even purple shirts but I will absolutely draw the line at pink! 




 This is staggering stuff: http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n22/chalmers-johnson/the-looting-of-asia

How can we diminish the importance the potential lowest point humankind has ever reached. The actions of Japan during the 1930's and 1940's brought about what is perhaps the most widespread suffering the world has known.  




 No way! I've never under-appreciated this dude since I learned about him in sixth grade. 

We've literally taken a crap on his legacy... Well, I guess that was point of his invention.   




 Rosalind Franklin... but that may be too easy as well because of all the posthumous recognition. 

I'll go with significant, not necessarily great, Robert Oppenheimer.

 It has been a long journey for this guy since playing in Texas trailer-parks. 

Now he's playing for ~$10million (American); so much to like about this guy's style of play. He ought to be a great fit.   




 You must have been that girl from Venezuela. 




 The dude's aura communicates so well. 




 Morrow   Hartnell are actually pretty clear to spot. 




 Wish I had been alive--or they would bring back--the NASL. Hockey fans would love it. MLS just is not that exciting. The NASL was able to lure big names like Pele and superstars from Europe. Plus they had probably the most intense post-regulation elimination shootouts. 

Shooter gets 5 seconds to take the ball ~40 yards   crack one on goal. Goalies can charge shooters, sit back, or get caught in no-man's land. Equally intense to the hockey shootout. Check it out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJEnwi7otu0  




 Uh. I think you mean that Chicago is like Toronto except Chicago has 10 times as many murders. But, otherwise a Canadian ought to love it here. Be smart and bring your own maple syrup.   




 interested. what time on sunday 9/2? 




 I would be interested for sure. 




 My '02 had problems with the Pass-Lock Security system that also made the ignition lock up   refuse to start. More info/solutions to this common problem with the Grand Am: http://www.bergerweb.net/grandamsecurityfix.htm 




 Or... keep it; instead of a 2 min penalty being assessed to the goalie, he becomes a skater who is allowed to handle the puck. However, being that he is outside the trapezoid/ goalie zone, the rules should allow for him to be bodychecked within the rules of checking any other puck-handling skater. I know my grandpa would love to see this, he suggests this every time he sees the damn trapezoid on tv. 




 Had to have been a Catholic/parochial school; being that it is evil to waste I was forced to eat the white, slime-based coleslaw by a nun. Not to mention the sandwich my brother's teacher fished out of the garbage for him.

 Just trying to gather some info from those who've newly found teaching positions in the area, and from those who are still looking.

What type of certification will districts be looking for? How big is the pool of applicants in respect to the number of positions open? 

Thanks!  




 Welcome back, Solar Bears. Such a quirky team with a weird history. Win a championship...cease to exist for a decade. 

Hope they are still wearing turquoise and eggplant purple jerseys with lowercase letters on the back. Be traditional, Orlando!

 Surprisingly enough, Defensive TD Total (7) = Rushing TD Total (7).

Not to mention, Forte: 3 Total TDs. Tillman   Briggs (combined): 4 TDs 




 He is 5th overall in WR scoring in my league. I'd say a must start every week. He was a full-participant in practice as well.

 I guess you need to look at economic/social trends in Eastern Europe. I live in an area with a high population of new immigrants from Poland. BMWs, iphones, and flashy clothing is very ubiquitous among this group. (much different from my Polish relatives who came here ~100 years ago, who primarily came in a wave of lesser-skilled labor)

A number of the 21st Century immigrants are probably coming here for work because of their technical or specialized knowledge. 




 Where's the bright green relish? 




 Total Bears domination in all phases. 




 51= Highest point total recorded by the Bears since 1980.

 I've been used to working 55 hrs a week for a while now. Draining work for sure, but I've got to imagine it's only about 4 months. 




 Thanks! This sounds a lot like what the job climate/ lifestyle is like for my uncle. I am definitely going to seek out his point of view as well. 




 Not incredibly random. I have a family member who is successful in the field, and have seen some of my college classmates transition into the professional field fairly soon after graduation.

It really takes a special kind of person to become an MD, and it really only pays more in the long run, considering that 4yrs of medical school + being an intern + the cost of school-related debt and malpractice insurance etc., etc., ...I cannot imagine that most MDs are making good money until they are past 30.  




 As is the case with many of us who are fresh graduates. Does an internship necessarily mean that you work for months in the field w/o getting paid? Already did an "internship" while student teaching, where I pretty much took over a classroom for 4 months, having to work nights and weekends w/o my university or cooperating school district knowing. Hoping not to get stuck in that situation at this point in my life.  




 Here is my situation: 24 y/o BA in Secondary Education; BA in History.

After two unsuccessful summers of not landing a full-time position as a history teacher, I am planning to do something more practical in place of the subject that I feel passionate about. The economic incentives of being a substitute teacher or a private school teacher are non-existent. I make more in my current position at a reading clinic/ my union weekend job.

From a purely practical/economic perspective, does it make sense for me to jump into a Masters of Science in Accounting program? 

It seems that the opportunities are more bountiful in this field, and if I strike out at landing a teaching job next year I'm probably going to give up anyway. Assuming that I can complete CPA certification, I probably can use a family connection to help me land a position in the accounting field. Just wanted to know if there is anything beneath the surface that would make it equally difficult for me in this field.

Thanks!
TLDR: (see title of post)  




 If lost forever in an endless field of celery, with no other edible items available I would begin to cannibalize myself before taking my first bite of celery. 




  In the game without disc Kane has significant shortcomings. 




 His presence on the power play was such valuable piece to the championship run. Let's be honest; the power play last year sucked. So, yes I miss the guy who was an immovable beast causing havoc in front of the goal. 




 Is this why cilantro tastes like soap to me? Not many flavors out there that I dislike, I'm just not a huge fan of soap.

 So many good ones from Season 2. That fact alone is why I've already given up trying to make a list. I'd like someone to list "Dennis   Dee get a new dad" though. Frank's *my wife is a whooooor* meltdown was legendary. 




 Piranha plant 




 I am starting F.Jones, Sproles, and Wayne week 7; I think you'd be best suited with F.Jones and Ridley in your starting lineup. A good dilemma to have @ WR, you can't go wrong. I like Wayne   Welker. They should see tons of targets.     




 Great start for Eddie Lack. This is his year to show that he has what it takes to play in the NHL. Anything less than an all-star nomination will be a disappointment. 




 Not the most popular, but one of the best lines was while driving a TVR. 

*and this CS button is for... Commit Suicide*
 




 Pick up Richardson if possible. He fell an eyelash short of 100 yds yesterday and had just 13 touches (11 rushes, 2 catches). Plus, the Rams are probably going to part ways w/ SJax at the end of the year, so they will probably give him a good deal of work in the near future to see what he can do.  




 Yes. Maclin isn't on too many leagues' waiver wires, jump on that opportunity. 




 As soon as i read the description for this thread an image of a purple Prowler just appeared in my mind. 




 Damn. Primarily over-expansion and overspending.  




 **[ENTRY]** [Pontiac Fiero GT] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FIEROi2.jpg) Why? An American mid-engine two-seater from a defunct manufacturer that is made almost entirely of plastic and has a weird cargo section near the engine, no bonnet (hood), and still has a cult following. 

Get Clarkson in one of these, would love to see his reactions to it.  




 [This video] (http://www.empireofsoccer.com/flashback-vid-the-nasl-shootout-new-york-cosmos-v-washington-diplomats/) shows the intensity and suspense that were present in NASL shootouts. The league really had a few glory moments. Pele came to the New York Cosmos, and for a while fans were thrilled and passionate. 

I watched the movie "Once in a Lifetime" the story of the New York Cosmos, and it seemed like the league could have created a whole new soccer experience for Americans.

I wasn't alive to experience the NASL, so my question for those who were is this: Why did it fizzle out? 
 




 Soccer is and has always been my favorite sport, but I honestly hate matches that end in a draw. [The NASL concept] (http://www.empireofsoccer.com/flashback-vid-the-nasl-shootout-new-york-cosmos-v-washington-diplomats/) to end matches had to have been such a suspenseful and awesome experience for fans though. I just wish that this concept would have caught on on a bigger scale, because no true soccer fan likes watching matches decided on penalty kicks. 




 The tie is a dead concept in the NHL with the dawn of the shootout. 




 This kid was quite the sniper for the Rampage a few years back. Such an abrupt and unfortunate ending. 




 In... the wulllld. 




 Merry Christmas from Chernobyl. 




 VW Fox? 




 Wayne. He's red hot and getting a plethora of targets. NYJ are not playing good defense at all. 




 Pettigrew is droppable. I hesitated to pull the plug on him, but his 5pts per week simply aren't paying off. You've got a better option there in K. Rudolph.    




 Risque pics. Your Volvo was showing in the last two. 




 My opponent will be praying that he scores 52 tonight. Not a bad monday night outside of the fact that the Texans/Jets matchup isn't interesting.

 Your pictures are a testament to how much Hyundai evolved from decades past. From the time [this was their idea of a sports coupe] ( http://www.autoevolution.com/cars/hyundai-scoupe-1992.html) until now it's reasonable to say that no other car manufacture has underwent such a image transformation. 




 In the spirit of this post, it's redundant redundancy. 




 Those were some sad times, my friend. That was our scoring line in Chicago. 




 5 ints! Romo is did a better impression of a Bears quarterback than the actual Bears quarterback. 




 Almost a decade later and the mention of [that] (http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=105344) still makes me cringe. Scott Stevens couldn't exist in today's NHL. 




 Hockey's Champions' League? What fan of hockey wouldn't love that. 




 Hell yes. A truly International Hockey League? The old IHL (RIP 1945-2001) only had one team, Soviet Wings, outside of N.A. for just one season.   

This would open up so many opportunities to see different styles of play   really good players who never fit into the North American style of play.  




 Not that surprising at all. A number of people in Jefferson Park, including my aunt, are keeping chickens. The serenade of chicken clucks and shrieks  isn't foreign to the Northside. 

When I was in undergrad i saw [this guy] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lJqRq0RAsk) almost every day! 




 Considering that most of this car is made of plastic, and that V8 is sitting right in the middle of it, you've got a very quick little ride there. 

I cannot look at this too long though, it's making me sad. Why it had to end for Pontiac while soulless Buick keeps on living is a reality I do not want to accept. 




 Consider the Mazda 3. Consumer Report is saying that it is a great buy. The new "Skyactiv" engine gets the best fuel economy in its class and is actually more fuel-efficient than Mazda's subcompact Mazda 2. Additionally, the long-term costs are projected to be low considering the trends of the Mazda 3's build quality and reliability over the past few years. The price is not that much different than the Cruze or Focus either.

I wish i was in the market for one today.
