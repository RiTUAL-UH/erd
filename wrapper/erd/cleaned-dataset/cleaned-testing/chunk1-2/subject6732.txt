 Just yesterday I have seen this quote being credited to Anne Frank! 




 Yes, Gitanjali is absolutely *the* place to start Tagore. 




 They're really worthy.. especially Kindle Paperwhite, which has an inbuilt light as well... Amazon has provided many many classics in Kindle format for free.. That's really something worth mentioning and worth respecting.. It has an AMAZING and flaunty life.. And the best part (although not accurately a moral point) about Kindle is you don't have to really *buy* the books in Kindle editions.. You can just download those ebooks in *.mobi* format from torrents.. I mean, come on, we all download stuff from internet! 




 A couple of years ago, I was introduced to the real beauty of words through *Gitanjali* by Tagore. (And that day I understood what kind of Literary art forms are awarded Nobels in Literature)

Have you people read that book..? If so, how you liked it?? 




 very fuckin funny!! 




 Oh fuuuuuuckkk!!! It's awesome :D :D :D 




 Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca from *Angels and Demons* by Dan Brown 




 **STEPHEN KING IS A GREAT WRITER.** 




  it relates to the themes of finding beauty and meaning in the dull American suburbs. 

Does Beauty mean trying to work out and develop body so that he can fuck his daughter's classmate??

(Although, I liked the part when he doesn't fuck her at the end..) 









 Too good!! 




 Yeah great thought definitely.. The actual source was Thoreau's very influential essay **Walking**. 









 Well, that's a very good TIL stuff! Thanks.. 




 I guess, that's because they're too busy trying to be funny in their comments in order to get up-voted.  




 care to explain, anybody?? 




 no words!! 




 Oh wow.. you gave there a whole new website for quoted pictures.... lovely!!!  




 Awesome!! JUst outstanding... 




 thank you so much for posting this here.. awesome post!! 




 this quote is directly going to my twitter right now.... 




 Something!! 




 "He didnt like what he had seen so far of moneys influence, and who could blame him? So far as he could see, money corrupted whatever it touched. Money kept his mother waiting for buses that never came and prevented him from attending schools that could have brought out the best in him. Money put people on different levels, in a way he found unnatural.  And money caused people to forget the right reasons for doing a thing." ~Michael Lewis, NEXT 




 [These](http://www.rstudio.com/faq-items/connect-rstudio-oracle-database/) might help. Sorry, if they don't. 




 [This](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/files/scicomp/Dloads/RProgramming/BestFirstRTutorial.pdf) is the tutorial that I was following.. and 3rd chapter knocked me down.

Any help would be much appreciated.

 




 Interesting. The quote, and its author, Friedrich Nietzsche, both are interesting.  




 I put quotation marks around the word finished because I've discovered that finishing a fiction writing project is not like finishing a cheeseburger. I've had to come to a point where I am at some acceptable equilibrium between "I want this to be perfect" and "I can't fucking look at this thing again

Very well put.. Might as well start a new sub with the name r/AspiringWriterProblems 

*Hey, I mean it, ah!* 




 Since my childhood, something about sky always interested me.. The mystery in there, in the eternal space has kept me enchanted and left me wondering about what dwells there and beyond. Now, once and for all, I want to take interest in Astronomy.. please suggest me where to start. (by the way, I'm 25 and from India) 









 Well, that's a pretty fucked up attitude for a growing future citizen of this world!  




 That's shit sad.. really.  




 Isn't it great to be a nerd!! Using the mind, keeping it focused for something worthy... I can only feel sorry for those who thinks bullying them is fun!!  




 So can they be just beaten up by other kids??.. Is *that* a good social acumen for them?? 




 In what ways? 









 See this is what reasoning sometimes does.. ruins the feel out of it.. Anyways, we won't do any *bioluminescence* for whatever worthy we want to burn in our lives.. so we can be fine with the quote! 









 In such case, the best part would be to rather talk.. Speak in English with someone who is good at it and ask them to correct you whenever you err. As this goes on, you will not only become good at grammar but also the correctness in grammar will become a part of your sub-conscious; and with this, you will even realize and catch errors (if any) in something that you read or write.. 

When I was learning English language in my school days, we were not allowed to speak in any regional language(I'm from India). So, that is how I learned English, by talking it and correcting it whenever I erred.

Listen to audio books as well.. It will be very helpful!

Good Luck :) 




 * **On Writing** by Stephen King 
* **The Elements of Style** by William Strunk

are the most famous of all... 
 




 I too am an aspiring writer from a country where English is not the official language, India.. Luckily enough, I was able to pursue all my education in English medium all along.. 

Ok, now coming to the *Writing* part. To write a well is an art. And to create art, you ought to be *inspired..*  As you're saying that you're interested in writing, I would suggest you to recognize the kind of writing that inspires you... You should take it from the very basic level..

*Start reading quotes*, lots of quotes from lots of authors.. And I'm sure that will inspire you.. and then alongside, think back into your own past experiences that you feel are vital for your life, and try writing small quotes/sentences about them, whatever they would be, just write a sentence about it. Once you start doing this regularly, you will not only feel like writing more of them, but you will also unconsciously strive to write them more beautifully.. That's how you start recognizing the preciousness of the **art** that you possess.

And once you do that, you will automatically get to know what more to do to improve your style, flow and simplicity in putting the words together.. When you're well into such process, you will eventually build up confidence and you will know what would be the purpose of your writing.

This is what I learned by practicing writing since past 4 years.. I started with writing blogs (began with Blogger, and after all this time, recently switched to Medium.com).. At the begining, my writings had lots of grammatical errors, but after all these years, I'm able to write better, with very less grammatical errors, and above all, with a more inspired spirit in my writing.

*Note*: Read more. Once when you start reading quotes from the books, and when you stumble upon a really really really grand quote or sentence, sit back and think what would've resulted somebody in writing such a sentence.. and then try to read the book which the quote came from... This way you will understand the context behind beautiful words and sentences and believe me, you will desire to create such onces youself.

Even after doing all this, if your skill or ability as a writer doesn't change or advance, tell me, I will give you my address.. you can come and kill me! 




 If you're a girl, gift me this and I will marry you :D 




 Awesome!!!! :D 




 I didn't had to read *Harry Potter* when I was a teenager, but I did.. So when I had faced ethical problems later in my years, where I could've reacted unethically, I opted not to be so. I was good, because I chose to be. Reading those books taught me to be that way.

That's what this quote means.. *It says that something from the books you read will surely stick within your heart and will determine the way you will walk in the path of life when faced with adversities!*  




 Always liked this quote!! 




 Yeah.. the conflict itself loses sense without the Time thing!! 









  How much creativity was lost to WW2?

An interesting and thoughtful point, indeed! 




 World is a small place, pal! 




 Alongside loving books, I'm also an avid lover of book covers... If any of you have any favourite book covers or collected albums of them, plz do share them here. I really really want to look at the best bookcovers in the world!!

Thanks :) 




 Watching movies is fine... but I seriously think you should read books... any normal person who can't go out for a couple of years would sit and watch movies, because it is *easy*... 

**Don't be easy!**

Read books... and if you can do that you'll be proud of these two years more than any couple of years in your entire life... and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/) is where you would want to go if you pick up the habit.

(I'm not suggesting you to not watch movies at all, of course you should... all I meant was when you look back, I don't want you to have only *watching movies* as a significant pastime, that is all).

All the best, pal! 




  Every five years, like clockwork, I think of what an asshole I was five years ago

This is so cool one.. and

Before I do anything, I ask myself "would an idiot do that?" If they would, then I do not do that thing. -Dwight

 Well, there is always a search engine these days, isn't there, pal! 




 That's the beauty of it!! 




 Some places on the internet this quote was widely attributed to Will Smith. 




 Very funny!! 




 Something! 




 This quote, even in the least bit, doesn't talk about fishing literally... So, you're peace from Fishing isn't going to be touched by this quote.. Chill :) 




 It is a metaphor that says people live all their lives doing things they are not even conscious about, they just survive and pass days in their lifetime... and then finally after their time is done, they go away without knowing what they lived for all this time.. 









 Oh.. OK.. I was just tying that in Reddit.. didn't do so in R itself. But thanks anyways.. Didn't knew this before :) 




 I'm a very newbie to R. I just found out that there are numerous datasets inbuilt into R's *datasets* package.

but when I tried to access them, I don't see anything.
For ex: when I type

data(Nile) //I have this 'Nile' dataset in the package

The data present inside it is not being visible. The prompt just goes to next line, and nothing happens. But in online examples they got the data when they typed a datasets name like: data(phones)

Any idea why am I not getting the data? 




 I like the way you presented it... like in UNIX :) 




 Oh How much I love this kind of posts!!!

 awesome!

 Hey this is cool....!! 




 Deep! 




 Too deep.... depressingly deep, but at one corner, inspiring.
Thank you so much for posting it. 




 I think I read the book in a hurry... But yeah lots of great quotes.. 




 Nailed it, dude! 




 Life is weird. You go from being strangers. To being friends. To being more than friends. To being practically strangers again.

This is very nice. 




 That's a very thoughtful sentence!! 




 Good guy M.. 




 Stabbing sharp! I think it's really unfair to post such a great quote without crediting its writer.. So, I just found out that it is written by **Naeem Callaway.** 




 Just what I need... that too from my favourite non-ficition author!! 




 Funny.. but makes sense! 




 Deep! 




 Philip is one of a kind!! 




 Can somebody explain this?? 




 If it smells like shit everywhere you go, you better check your shoes. 

Very nice..

honey why is this whiskey bottle half empty? because you are a pessimist

Well, that's being too frank to your face. Awesome ofcourse!

Very nice list, friend! Thank you.. You should make more of these...

 I was actually thinking to do this specially for Gone Girl.. I was spellbound by Trent   Ross for their work in *The Social Network* and I'm also enjoying *Gone Girl* now... 




  8tracks

Never heard of this.. Will surely try.. Sounds interesting what you did. 




 Wow.. what a post... I really do... Moreover, I imagine and hum in my mind some Hollywood OSTs when reading some of the most important and influencing aspects in a story... It feels seriously enriching experience.... 




 I recently finished reading Michael Crichton's PREY.. and the closing line was deeply provoking:

"*They didn't understand what they were doing.*

I'm afraid that will be on the tombstone of the human race."



I felt interested in asking you people about such touching closing lines from other books.. Let's post/share such lines. Thanks! 




 I've very recently starting my career with first job by working with Informatica ETL processes.. I'm keenly interested in Data Science.. So, I want to ask you if there a way for me to eventually make a switch into Data Science? What is the necessary skill set that I would need to do so, and is working in Informatica tool going to be of any help to me in the journey towards being a Data Scientist?? 














 1984. It is said to be a timeless classic book in English Literature..  I started it some time long ago, nearly more than a month ago and am still not able to finish it. For me it is surely not a page turner. I'm just keeping up with it still because I feel bad when I start a book and decide not to finish it, so am just trying to read it page by page and find out if I can realize why it is such a classic.

There are many instances in the plot that seemed really senseless.. Winston, Julia and O'Brien... there is no proper relation between how they develop their opinions and feelings that they have for one another.. Why Julia loves Winston and a lot more such loose ends..

Can somebody please tell me why this 1984 is a classic?? 




 A dystopian time period... people living by a set of strange rules and practices... the protagonist character also lives as one among them all.... and then eventually he starts thinking differently... and then a girl character enters the story and that stirs him for even more revolutionary ideas and actions that protest against those time period socially accepted customs... 

I have observed the same plot line in very well known classics Fahrenheit 451, 1984, and also a novella Anthem (by Ayn Rand)... 

Now, why is that??  














 Truth be told, I'm heavily influenced by Inception film.. Ever since then, I am interested in lucid dreaming concepts.. I've tried to come up with interesting story lines... but whenever I start writing something.. After some time, inevitably I ask myself "How is this different from Inception, anyways?? Why would people want to read this when they've already seen all this in Inception?"

So I want to ask you people: Is it really possible to write a lucid-dreams fiction, whose concepts would appear new, while most of it is already covered in the Inception film in a very grand manner???

Please help me... 














 For me, it's every line from *The Social Network*. Every freakin' line, I tell you!

If I've to be really precise, I would pick:


"It's raining."

"I'm sorry."

"It just started raining." 




 I'm an aspiring writer, and I thought myself to be a fine amateur at Writing. But just today I came across [Medium](http://medium.com) and it was great, but the content I saw there overwhelmed me. Honestly and shamelessly saying, friends, looking at what and how good people are writing there, I found myself being far far from their quality. I'm deeply depressed from all the content I saw there and am feeling very underconfident about my Writing skills. Can somebody please help me?? Thank you! 




 Whenever I come across some books that have started a new sub-genre kind of thing in themselves (eg: Cyberpunk, Quantum Fiction and etc..) I feel very motivated.. I'm an aspiring writer and I want to write very different books that would completely stand out from the mainstream conventions of sci-fi or any categorizations of literature.. 

Any tips on how to invent a new genre/sub-genre in Writing??
 




 I'm reading **The Undercover Economist** by Tim Harford.. I'm a novice to economics, but am interested in learning it. So I picked up this book and am reaching its end right now. But there are many things in that book that left me in dark, many concepts seemed very unclear to me, especially the concepts like how game theory is used in auctions and lot more such things from that book. I understood some concepts very well and now am looking at those things differently in everyday reality. So, I want to also get the gist  of those concepts that I didn't understand clearly when I read them from the book. Can somebody please provide me with a link that has a detailed chapter vise summary of the book or any of your personal analyses of them?? It would be of *GREAT* help if you people can do that for me. Thank you! 




 All mylife I've been great at nothing, only good and ok at a few things. I'm very much fed up with such life style. I want to know how can i remove this mediocrity from my life forever. Tell me what kind of things I would need to do en route this path. (By the way, my ambition in life is to become a *great* writer! ) 




 The way the character Jordan Belfort talks in the movie is simply outstanding and really captivating.. the confidence in his words, his body language, his aggression, the articulation -- all in all his way of speech is everything that a person with "I-want-to-win-the-world" attitude needs!

I'm really impressed by all that.. I want to talk like him... How do I do that?? Any ideas and suggestions?? (By the way, I'm an Indian!) 




 Ive finished 100 days of abstinence and there is a specific viewpoint of mine that I want to portray today to the members of this brotherhood about the subject at hand, *the addiction.*

Along this time, Ive only, or at least mostly, seen people referring to masturbation as a completely negative thing in their lives and it ruining their vital time. People say its a demon that stops ones development in life and so should be killed. *I dont agree.* It should not be ended; it should rather be fought and conquered but never despised and killed, never; because the real meaning of victory is not killing but conquering. After all, what would we, the powerful Humans, the soldiers who man the eternal Universe residing within each of us, do if there is no worthy opponent, if there is nothing standing between us and the ambitions we carry in our hearts? You can trek to the heights and watch the horizons only when there are mountains present in your way and blocking the view. So, I say your addiction (to masturbation or anything else) is not a prison that locks you up but a gym that strengthens you; and of course strength is only enjoyable when it is tested, not when it is rested. So it tests you, it weakens you, it hits you in the face, it hits you in the heart, it provokes you to fight back, and in the process it makes you stronger, it makes you brave, it makes you familiar to the hurdles again and again in the form of ups and downs, crests and troughs, so that when you encounter greater ones ahead in your life, you dont fear them anymore. Addiction can be an ocean of pleasure; you either learn to swim it and enjoy the dive, or fall straight in and drown away into its depth; choice is yours; and in both the above cases, ocean is not to the blame. A gymnasium is presented to you but working out in there is solely your duty. Don't offend your addictions, overrun them.

After 100 days of staying away from PMO, especially masturbation, this is all Ive realized about it. I wont hate it, I cant hate it; because it gave me intense pleasure since my puberty and I cant deny that. So, I stopped seeing it as an enemy, I never saw it as an enemy, I only saw it as a competitor, as an opponent, who irks me to dare win against it. 

I started my abstinence not at all because I was an addict of masturbation, but because its very valuable and enjoyable to me and I wanted to sacrifice such blissful pleasure for a goal that I took up in my life, like leaving the joy and comfort of home and going to the war to achieve my goal. That day was the start, and today it is 100 days; and this is just the beginning. 

*Thank you all, for your unstopping support to many brothers like me here, justifying the name, a brotherhood!* 




 Last year I had A lot of free time.. so I managed to read some 35 books in that year.. that's the biggest number ever for me, till date. Now I'm into my first job theses days. Moved into a new city and new time shcedules and stuff liek that... But these days, after entering into the actual career I'm observing that I'm not reading like before at all... I'm unable to enjoy the reading like before, too. My reading list has increased massively. I love to read, I bought more 20 books from a bookslae and lot of ebook downloads for my Kindle, but besides all this I'm not understadning these new changes in my reading habit and how to cope up with it.. Any suggestons and views?? 




 I see only boys making posts and replying the threads over here. I am wondering if this page is having only male members.. and eventually that made me question myself if we, the MEN, are the weakest Human species when it comes to lust related activities, which is why we needed a whole internet community here to abstain ourselves from PMO!!

Do girls ever, like *EVER*, suffer this PMO related things like us, at all?? 




 Recently there was a conservation going on with my friend about porn and masturbation and I mentioned to him that I took break from all those things. 

Friend: Why don't you masturbate?

Me: Just like that, took a break for a while.

Friend: Whatever happens won't you masturbate?

Me: No. I won't.

Friend: What if a very sexy girl comes to you? You won't fuck her? 

Me: No.

Friend: Won't you even masturbate thinking about her?

Me: No.

Friend: Why? Don't you have a dick??

Me: *I do. And I also have dignity in my dick.*




I felt very good about myself after I said. 




 I've always had this doubt inside my mind and now I started watching Carl Sagan's **Cosmos** hence this rose again in me. Now I can't stop asking this to the world, once and for all:

When we talk about the Cosmic entities such Planets, Solar Systems, Stars, Galaxies and etc, we talk in light years.. We, the human beings never even have set foot on the farthest planet even in our own solar system, but we diligently talk of numerous Galaxies apart from our own as if we have a crystal clear knowledge of them. 

When we haven't been to any of the other planets or to any farther than our own solar system, how the hell can we say that we are this much far this this galaxy and that much far from that galaxy??

 Not just that, anything and everything that is being told about the cosmic universe by our science, how can we be so sure about it all?? For example, in the Cosmos TV Series, *Ryan Nebula* is said to be **ONLY** 1500 Light Years away from Earth.. How on earth can we even envision, sitting here on this planet, about something that requires one to travel for 1500 years at the speed of light?? 

How in the world do we know all these things? I beg for the answers!!

 




 I'm a blogger and book reader.. For some of my future ventures I need an extensive knowledge of various systems, including how the society works, how an organization works, how corporate works and stuff like that.. So,  I want to start observing them and learn from them. But there is so much that happens around them all that I often get lost in thinking what to observe and take into account. 

Can somebody pleaes suggest what kind of observations of the world or a system are vital for understanding those systems in depth? 




 Although all sci-fi movies aren't good, their sound tracks can sometimes be captivating. I'm collecting such grand and enigmatic tracks from sci-fi movies. Please give out the names of those movies that you've felt as having great sci-fi tracks.

My personal favourites: TRON Legacy, Oblivion, Inception...

 I love to read books.. and then one day, just like that, I also discovered erotica (erotic stories) and started to love the kinky ones..!! I would even go further and say that I was once addicted to them than to the actual porn.. 

Now, I'm into NoFapping.. I'm on my 70+ days without fapping. But recently, as I started exploring Reddit, I found those subreddits that are very closely related to the kind of erotica I used to read.. and was kinda into them for a couple of days on the weekend.. I broswed through lot of captioned pictures on reddit and some real life stories...

I realized this is wrong too and am again trying to keep myself away from them like I did when started NoFapping a couple of months ago, although I didn't reset my badge right now because I **did not** masturbate at all!!

So, plz tell me does reading erotica, watching related captioned pictures and feeling aroused comes under Porn?? 




 I love to read a lot and I also chose to do so in my life because my future dreams are related to me reading varaciously. But I don't read so fast like many poeple and that makes me low sometimes.. Any of you with similar issues, friends?  I would like to be helped with some suggesstions too!! 




 I very recently bought 'Mein Kampf' by Adolf Hitler, published by Wilco Classics. It was a leather bound edition for a very less price, for just Rs.275 (less than $6). I was impressed by the hard binding, quality of the paper and the print. Out of curiosity I then browsed for other books from Wilco. Fortunately, I found lot of other books, all leather bound/hard cover editions and at prices even lesser than the one I mentioned above.

But to my surprise, none of the books are rated/reviewed (in Amazon). This made me wonder whether these books from Wilco Classic Library are of people's interest or not.

What do you people think of them?? Are there any particular disadvantages if one collects Wilco Classic editions?? 




 I see a number beside people's posts and comments in this NoFap section.. Can somebody tell what that represents?? In case it is the number of days the subscriber is away from fapping, is there any way that I can start the number from 60 plus, because i've been away masturbating since a couple of months.. To look at the number of days is kinda inspiring and encouraging to continue that way!!  





























 The narrator seems to be too biased and at times even came out as an asshole.

The type of girl who "went to college," but majored in communications and sleeping with professors.

I told you, the 'asshole' type of thinking, it is especially because of the above sentence. It felt like the most judgemental sentence I've read in the recent days. Even grammer didn't seem fit for that repelling sentence: *majored* (past tense) and then *sleeping* (continous tense). I'm not sure if that's right (I'm not native in English) but I'm having a feeling that its not, because the sentence sure sounds very wrong grammatically as well. 




 Rest In Peace, sir! 




 Today when I was practicing Sudharshana Kriya, I observed, or rather experienced, one profoundly simple realization. When I dived deep into the breathing pattern at the end of the Kriya process, there came one frozen frame in time, Im calling it the *Moment*, where I realized what present moment means. 

At that one frame of time (I refer to it as a frame of time because I dont want to give it a unit of measurement, like the *second,* and make it sound quantifiable) everything in my life, both the past and the future seemed to be unified, aligned in one straight line telling me what I have been doing all my life has led me to this moment and what I do now will lead me further.

*We live not thinking about the past or dreaming about the future. Although theyre necessary at times, we sure create them both with the building blocks of present.*

I know, this is not a new concept, but the way I experienced it, deep down in meditation, had impacted me more, like never before. I guess what made this more influential is an activity I undertook the day before. I decided to take up Zen, which is all about experiencing the moment as you live through it. 

Dots do connect.

And I understood the singularity of life.
 




 I thought I knew life. 




 World is a small place.. and at the same time big too :) 




 I am actually waiting for this pic to turn up.. I collected it long back but am unable to find it... Now I got it again through this post.. thank you so very much :) :) 




 I watched the movie 4 times and I gave only one reason for doing so: *I deserved every bit of that film* :) 




 Hey pal.. thank you so much for the creative critique... The things you pointed out are very helpful for me to improve.. Thank you so much :) :) 




 And also, I think that quote in the title doesn't say the same thing as compared to the one I thought to be the correct version. The title quote emphasizes that the things that you worry about do happen in real.. and thus you worrying about them is justified.

But in the one that I commented, it says we worry about things that are not going to happen.. thus not justifying our worries.

Lot of difference! 




  The quote in the title says pretty much the same thing, but is more witty and sounds like something Twain might have said or written.

Ironically I too felt the same way about the corrected version in the comment I gave. Funny! 




 Makes great sense. Thanks :) 




 Good one :) 




 I guess the quote actually reads: "I've lived through some terrible things in my life, some of which **never** happened."

He was talking about how worrying about the things that might go wrong is actually worse than those things themselves. I can't point out to the source, but I sure remember Twain telling it this way. 

It makes sense.
 




 Hey thank you for the critique.. I incorporated the changes pointed out by you.. Thanks a lot once again :) :) 




 Hey thanks for pointing out the things that made this piece unimpresseive to you.. Yes in this piece rather than a full story or a conflict. I just tried to write about some mystic encounters of a person with a light that he saw in his dreams which mysteriously tranformed him and made him get better at things that were bothering him. It's like a magical medicine that he doesn't know where it was coming from.

I will keep your review in mind and shall practice on with the aspects you mentioned.

Thank you so much, Kalteras :) :) 




 Thank you so very much, pal, for such a helpful review.. All those things that you pointed out, especially comma things, will definetly help me get better. Commas always confuse me so much.. Any suggestions there??

 I'm honestly surprised how well this is written for being non-native! Can I ask how long you've been writing in English? 

Thank you so much for the compliment. I've been writing in English for four years now. Mostly I wrote blogs and articles (but with lot of errors, I now realize), never serious ficiton though except for a couple of short stories. Tried my hand at writing real fiction in the past but didn't work so kept it on hold. Now I felt that it is time I took it up seriously. So here I am writing flash fiction for practice. 
 
 I think fix up this stuff 

Yes, I just did.. I wholeheartedly thank you so very much for the help :) 




 I will just critique like a reader himself who can also write. I'm not a native English speaker, I'm from India:

* In the opening line, the word 'exactly' being used multiple times slightly made the sentence a bit pretentious. Try changing that, if you can.

 He had huge hands, so long that if it stretched it, it would go through the walls and..
 
I think it should be "He had huge hands, so long that if he (you just mentioned the monster as a He) stretched them (plural, *hands* - right) they would go (plural again.)

 So thats why it sat on its toes,

Hmm, fine. But maybe sitting on its (or his, I'm not sure. its is fine though) knees would do better, I guess.

 It was just sitting there staring at me, **with its eyes**,

I don't think that emphasizing that it is staring at you with its eyes is necessary. Everything in the universe looks with its eyes only, no!

 They looked like ordinary human eyes except they were extremely yellow, and instead of a pupils it had a lightings, opening a persons mind into another world, most people called it a nightmare, but to me it was a dreamland.

Good and important sentence, but first of all it's too long, without easy readability and also grammatical errors. Singular - Plural mostly ('a pupils', 'a lighting's' - just pupils - no a, 'a' makes it singular; same for lightings - no a and also no apostrophe, I guess). But I would say instead of 'lightings' find a better word. May be *sparks.*

 Most children at that age liked to go to the

Most children at *my* age  - would've done better, because a moment later you're bringing that point onto you, saying that you like staring at it rather. So, this seemed better. 

 So I told my mother, she embraced me, and told me that monsters dont exist.

Embraced is not establishing your point here. You can expand this point. Because it's an important one. It is showing that he was not believed by people. So, this can be better I guess: "So, I told my mother. She looked back at me with a calm and unsurprised but an understanding look in her eyes. She took me close and hugged me, and said that monsters dont exist."

I don't know if you like my description but it I'm trying to tell you that this is an important moment in the story and so finishing it so justly wouldn't do good.

 refusing to neither eat nor drink anything until I saw the monster again.

It's *either - or*. Because you already said *refusing* which is a negative, and *neither - nor* is again a negative. No double negatives.

 As a kind hearted mother she couldnt bare it, she refuse to believe me.

It's bear - not bare. And refused. 

Ended the story well. Overall, I liked the story. It's very good. I like such fantastic and mystic incidents put into words. And coming to your writing. I sense that English is not your native language. It's not mine too, like I mentioned at the beginning. So, you have some grammatical errors. Needed correcting. But after the sentence "As a kind hearted mother she couldnt bare it, she refuse to believe me." Everything went too fast. Situations aren't established well. Maybe you can take a second look on that.

overall it's a 7/10 for the storyline. English is to be improved grammatically.

But I'm having a feeling that you're going to do a lot better in the coming days. In some ways, I see myself in you. I see my own writing in yours. We can all improve and we should -  we will.

All the very best... And once again, Good story.. keep it up :)



[And hey, now a quick tip about posting in this Sub. Do select a **flair** for your story, like a genre. Yours can be *Fantasy*, I guess. And also critique others' stories. Else they put you into Leeching (they already did, which is why I'm telling this. Normally leeched posts are ignored by members here.) which means you're a freeloader over here, taking critiques but never giving them back to others. I faced it last week. You please don't. You wrote a good story.]
 




 This is my second flash fiction. (I'm from India and English is not my native language. But I love this language which is why I made writing in it as my life's purpose.) Here, I tried to voice out the character's mystic experiences in his life. I didn't emphasize in this piece on the name of the character or his environment or such minute daily life details, but on his internal voice. And it's also written in first person.  Please critique it in whatever way you think will be helpful for improving my fiction-writing skill. I'm open to all your comments.Thank you, all :)

                                                       THE VAGUE LIGHT

It is said that you shouldnt chase butterflies; rather you should sit down and wait for them to come to you. Well, I didnt chase butterflies, but all my life I had chased a light, a particular light that I saw in my dreams. 

The light appeared for the first time in my dream when I was a child. I remember that day because I was laughed at by the entire class for failing in the 5th grade Math exam. After that night, after I saw that light in my dream, Math ceased to scare me anymore. The light didnt make me a genius in Math, but it did stop me from being scared of it. In a way, it protected me.

Eventually, I turned 16, and got my first rejection from a girl I liked in my neighborhood. I asked her out on my birthday. She took it for a joke but when I told her I meant it she felt annoyed and stopped talking to me. I liked her very much, the rejection bothered me. And then one night, that light appeared again in my dreams. From the day after, looking at that girl never troubled me. 

There came a time when I needed a job desperately. I was 24. I couldnt get any job due to the financial meltdown that hit the world hard. I felt like a loser looking at all the comfortable parts of peoples lives, and wondered why I always reside on the other side of the things that I wished in my life. I didnt find an answer because at the moment finding a job felt more reasonable than finding answers to the unanswerable questions of life. So, I restarted my job search, and yet after months time nothing seemed to be changing. I became weaker at heart with each email response I never got from the companies I applied for. I started believing in all the bad things in the world that happen to good people. I had always thought that I was one of those good people and now my current situation in life only confirmed it.

Not finding a job made me unhappy and dissatisfied. Happiness and satisfaction in life can be measured in the amount of peaceful sleep one gets every night. If you can go to bed and sleep without anything bothering you, youre a happy man. I used to sleep happily every night, holding in mind the dreams for my future, but now I held only despair. Night by night my sound sleep moved farther and farther away, but it left the sound part behind for me, the sound of unruly thoughts, the noise of desperation to make a career, and the necessity to have a constant income  they stayed with me. I truly reached an impasse on life, and it was all darkness. I needed light.


It happened in the middle of the night. I opened my eyes to a white nothingness. I couldnt see a thing. It was blindingly bright, but it was familiar. Whichever side I turned my sight to it was only infinite luminance. The light. It came back for me. I couldnt move. I just stood there in front of it, inside it, becoming one with it. After some time, I was disappearing into the light; or maybe it felt like all that light was disappearing into me, but I didnt know for sure. I slowly felt the falling, quietly, drifting down, towards something. And I opened my eyes to the bright rays of morning sun spreading on the walls of my room. 

That day, I decided to start my own business and never look for a job again. 




 from *Walking* by Thoreau 




 That's very encouraging. Thank you :) 




  It's not wasted work, it's practice.

This is one great piece of advice. Nailed it.

 Experience a story every day. You'll magically feel motivated to write again.

I recently started writing Flash-Fiction to get better at writing fiction. This is how I'm trying to feel everyday, experiencing a new story!

Thanks.. All the very best for the great future ahead :) 




 INTERSTELLAR sure energized me to become better at my art: **Writing!** 




 Great that your book is out... Good Luck, pal :) 




 Hey thanks a lot... Am downloading the documentary already.. Will surely watch.. I like docus very much :) 




 I like the flash fiction pieces that emphasize more on *single-scene* settings rather than long *short-stories*. It gives more chance to take the reader into a part of the story, like waking up to a moment into the dream.. You never remember all of the dream, only few vague portions of it. [Flash Fiction, according to me should be like that, or at least *that's my style*.]

Your work is good. The descriptions were easy enough to paint a good visual picture to the reader. Keep it at that level, it's good. Now, on the other side of the things, the writing from the point where a gun was pointed at the back of his head to the moment the stranger entered the last digit into the safe.. things didn't seem much clear. It felt like what you wanted to say wasn't properly delivered. In short, that part was unclear. 

Over all.. Good work 7/10.

 All the best for the next one :) 




 Awesome and outstanding :D 




 Awesome design....  




 Wow.. thank you so much for mentioning this... You just gave me new books to read in my life... :) :) 




 Nice post... Deep down, little emotional... Geographically, at least! 




 Yes. Please. 




 Yeah there is something there.. What's that?? 




 Kindle Paperwhite, of course! 




 *Under The Dome* being more than 800 pages did put me away from picking it up till now, but someday I will read it, which is why I never watched the TV Series past S01E01. But then Stephen King is like that only. Master Artists don't mind the length when they're really keen on their work. But then hey this is a misconception. In Harry Potter series multiple books are way more than 400 pages, but they're a part of my life and may be I would've been disappointed if they were written any shorter. 




 One of the best film posters of all time. A really awe inspiring one. 




 I guess the look on Amelia's face at the closing shot self-explains that she didn't have a clue of all the Good that happened to the Mankind because of their mission. She should've known. But may be that's why our hero started his journey to her, probably to tell her how important she was in her contribution to the saving of Mankind.  




 I like to believe it to be true. May be there is a Parallel Universe where you're right and you exist in another Universe, and are sending back dreams to your other self in other universe, who is wondering about it all. I love this shit! 




 Did Buddha put his tongue out in this pic....?? I remember a picture of Einstein doing the same. By the way, awesome drawing, pal. Keep it up :) 




  the premise of the story is good, but the dialogue just didn't seem natural.

Yes.. when I re-read it on and on I'm feeling this too. That's where I think I need to concentrate from now on. Any suggestions are most welcome :)

 you were translating from Indian to English

I really wasn't trying to do that, I was writing in direct English. But knowing that this is how it sounds to reader made me feel real awkward about my writing. But thanks for coming up with this point, because I believe this is a very vital aspect for a non-native English fiction writer, which I completely am.

 The last part, while a really good idea, isn't executed quite right. I found it really hard to believe that somebody would throw keys that close to another person (even if they don't like her) and that she would have time to stand up, hear someone say "MYTHYA, WAIT, DONT STAND! (by the way, caps made it seem like the person was screaming at the top of his lungs which would take even more time), and then throw her hands up to cover her face. I don't think her reaction to that warning would be to cover herself. 

Special thanks for pointing out the occurrence errors.. will keep that in mind next time.

 I think it might be better if Praveen said: "Mythya, look out!" as that would signal that there is some sort of danger coming at her.

Now, that is very straight and simple (why didn't I do that before!) 

Thank you for the entire response which is going to influence me in the direction of good writing :) :) 

And I would like to ask you if you know of any resources that would help me in bettering my *dialogue.* 


 




 Hey PrpleWlf, thank you so very much for the extra effort. Your suggestions are very supportive. The way you pointed out the difference between usage of languages depending on region is very new and helpful. And coming to my nativity thing, although I'm from India, my life's aim is to become a very good English language novelist. I've great stories to tell, but the kind of fiction-writing skill that I possess puts me far away from it. I will take up the journey and travel far to reach it. 

And special thanks for re-writing the first paragraph in your way, this would help me think better the next time when I rework on it. Although getting a translator is a good idea, I want to put up the necessary skill into myself to become good at writing fiction. Courses would be a good idea.. thank you for mentioning that :) :)

 Truly hoping this is of some great help, and not to demoralizing;

Your response is in no way demoralizing. It is truly some great help.
Thank you so much :)
 




 Thank you so very much for the critique :)

I have to say that it was very difficult as an English reader to get through simply due to the grammatical issues

Can you please point out where I went wrong?? Honestly, I believed that my English is good, but looking at what you just said, I now feel the fire to learn where in my grammar that I should improve.. Thank you so much for that. 

 While the ideas behind the story are good, the grammar takes away from it.

Yes. This is a real trouble.. Please shoot at me whatever suggestions you have in this aspect. 

 Do not take this to mean you should give up in writing,

I can never do that. Never!

 I would not expect myself to be able to write in your own native tongue without first learning the language

You just opened my eyes to the fact that I do not know English as good enough as a writer should know. (I mean, I speak good English everyday with people all around me. Even now, I'm talking to you fine, I believe, with no grammatical errors.)

Thank you once again for the very uplifting review.. If you can, just help me with the above mentioned issues as well. Thanks :) :) 




 I realized Flash Fiction to be very helpful for polishing your writing abilities. This one here is my first flash fiction. It might even probably suck. But I don't mind. I'm here to listen to you guys and improve my fiction-writing skill, or rather build it up. I don't know. Please just critique this piece as much as you can. I want only to get better, that's my sole purpose. (I'm from India, so English is not my native language, but suggest me there as well.) Thank you all very much :)







It was 10.15 AM on a Monday morning, and peoples minds were just migrating from a weekend induced relaxation to the work environment again, getting their psyche ready for the next five days of hustle bustle in their daily lives.



Mythya was seated at her desk with her hands loudly and busily typing a mail to her manager about the tasks for the week ahead. She does that every Monday. She looked at the clock, and pictured how the next 5 days were going to be. *Occupied as always with nothing unusual ever to happen in my life,* she thought. 



Karthik sits opposite to Mythya, four desks ahead. Distracted by the typing noise, turned his head to see who it was that sounds involved in work so seriously already, and found that most of his team mates were not even seated at their desks. Hey who is disturbing the blissful morning silence with the noise of work? asked Karthik.



Praveen and Vinod were standing few rows away from Mythya. Praveen was stretching his body, getting ready to go and get a bite of something in the cafeteria. Beside him Vinod was holding the key ring of his shelf and playing with it in his hands.



Its her, said Praveen lazily, pointing to Mythya, she must be sending her work schedule for the week. 



Yes, guys, responded Mythya, just typing the usual weekly mail. We all got to do this.



Yeah, right, but not already, said Karthik. Its Moday morning, for Gods sake, kill some time. 



She looked at him and chuckled.



Praveen stared at Mythya for a moment and something came up in his mind. Karthik, talking of work, I guess I left some important papers at your desk last Friday. 



Yeah, you did. I locked them up in Vinods shelf, said Karthik pointing to the desk next to him. 



Vinod felt attentive at the mention of his name. Oh yes, sorry, I forgot to mention that, he said to Praveen, still playing with the key ring.




Karthik, please do me a favour, started Praveen. Im going for breakfast, meanwhile please take out those papers and keep them at your desk. Ill come back and collect. 



Sure. Just get me the keys of the shelf. 



Yeah, right. Please hand him your keys, he said turning to Vinod.



Here, catch, called out Vinod, and raised his fist to throw the key. 



At the exact same instant Mythya started to rise from her desk. Praveen observed this. MYTHYA, WAIT, DONT STAND! he said, loudly.



By then the key ring had left Vinods hand and was shooting towards Mythyas head which abruptly appeared in its trajectory.



Listening to her name in a loud caution, Mythya reflexively raised her both hands in defense, covering her face and head.



As she did this, the key that was about to hit her had stopped in front of her hands, but it did not fall down  *it started to float in the mid-air.*


 




 Yes... Miss this guy :( 




 Please suggest me how to practice Informatica PowerCenter Tool. There are a lot of practice exercises on the internet but I don't have any repositories. Is there a way where I can build my own repository or download some free ones?

Please point out any other ways to build expertise in PowerCenter tool. Also include, if you can, info about certifications and their corresponding study resources. 

Thanks a ton. 




 Thank you so much! 




 "It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities." - Albus Dumbledore, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*

This sentence has stayed with me, and will stay so till my last breath. 




 It's an awesome book.... In some way, it is better than the movie... You will know what I mean when you read the last page of the book. You will see the difference yourself. 




 Once again, I love this kind of posts! 




 No, I'm not! 




 That's sad to hear :( 




 Good one :)  




  Wait a minute, Reddit has some originality?

I meant the ideas that people come up with. They can be original, of course. Imagine J.K. Rowling coming here years ago and asking how it would be if she builds a world where they teach magic to kids as a field of academics.. I guess, Harry Potter wouldn't have been as big a phenomenon as it is today if somebody had stolen her idea and made a movie on it even before she wrote the first book! 




 There are some subs here such as [r/Writing](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing) or [r/WorldBuilding](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding) where people put forward new ideas they have for some of their future ventures, like writing a book, for example.

So, looking at those posts I often wonder what if somebody copies your idea and comes up with similar venture without giving you your credit? 

*How can we rely on the safety of the original ideas that we share on Reddit??* 




 The one thing that felt interesting to me in the entire film was that she disappears after reaching the infinite potential (the 100%) just like the car did in the example she demonstrates to the professors. 

So, at the end I saw it as Lucy *becoming one with the Time,* and thus turning herself infinite and forever, which I think explains her last words: *"I AM EVERYWHERE"*  - just like Time. Time is everywhere. 




 This is my first flash fiction reading I guess.. and I would now say what practicing the *show don't tell* type of writing means! Thanks.. I'm gonna Save this post and come back to it for reference to help my own writing practice. Great work, pal :) 




 She was very hot as CatWoman!! :D 




 Please remove this post if you like the scene so much... With this camera quality video you're dirtying the people's food called Interstellar. 




 Ok.. as promised, I just listended to both tracks, and they didn't sound similar in any manner... to my ears!  




 :D :D :D :D :D  




 listening to both of them rightaway.. will get back to you on this. 




 Yeah... True.

*I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.* -Maya Angelou 




 Awesome man.. thank you so much.. I literally Googled for this kind of pic of Endurance.. And here it is today... Credit goes to you ofcourse.. thanks a lott :) :) 




 Thanks for the answer. 




 Thanks for the question. 




 That's a nice idea...!!  




 Thank you for pointing that out for me :) :) 




 Thank you so very much for the resources.. :) 




 Thanks for poiting it out.. I too am going to read his answers for other questions.. May be I can learn a lot.. 




 Thank you very much for the answers.. and by the comment that *showurnust* posted I got to know that you answered various other questions in this sub.. so I just befriended you here so that I can read all the possible explanation given by you for other questions.. Thank you so much for the good work.. 




 Yeah you're right... I was thinking like a 3D being ;) 




 thank you very much for the answers.. :) 




 Thank you so much for the answers.. I appreciate it very much :) :) Thanks a lott, especailly for quoting Kip Thorne. 




 Yeah you're right. Because just now, I came back from watching the film for the third time. I posted that on Twitter and some person tweeted me saying "what a waste of 9 hours!" 

I mean, what the hell, how can someone say such a thing about INTERSTELLAR. 




  Typical third dimension beings.

Yeah *Muggles*
 




  It's beautiful, utterly beautiful.

Yes. Nothing less! 




 1.	When the crew left Earth, they reach *Endurance* in just a matter of minutes. Is *Endurance* placed so near to Earth?

2.	How did Brand know that they are dealing with the beings  (they) of five dimensions?

3.	Why did Romily die? What caused the explosion? And why was Dr.Mann trying to kill Cooper?

4.	How come NASA manufactured a Space craft that can travel into the higher dimensions without even knowing what those dimensions hold?

5.	In the 5th dimension scene (where Cooper is hanging around the bookshelf) he gives the S.T.A.Y message to Murph first. Later on, he gives her the coordinates for NASA in Binary. But those things happened the other way, no? First they stumbled upon NASA secret location and later when he was about to leave his Earth, Murph gets the S.T.A.Y message.

6.	And why did he even send the S.T.A.Y message at all? If Murph wouldve convinced him showing that message, they would have never saved the Mankind, so why did he even send the S.T.A.Y message in the first place?

7.	The data was coded into the seconds hand in the watch when Murph (young) placed the watch on the bookshelf after picking it from the floor. But only years after that day Murph (grown up) comes back to pick it, and then sees the seconds hand moving. So, has Cooper been waiting there behind the bookshelf in 5th dimension all that time for her to grow up and come for the watch? 

8.	How did Murph (grown up) suddenly realize that it was Cooper that has been her ghost all along?

9.	Tesseract gets closed and Cooper was pushed outside of the worm whole and was later on found by other Rangers. So, by the time he came out of the wormhole back into our galaxy, has his data been utilized and the whole plan A thing worked already? Because he looks to be of the same age when he wakes up in hospital on Cooper Station, and two weeks later Murph turns up as a very old woman (of some 80 plus years, but when she shouts Eureka she was may be just 35 plus.. so what has Cooper been doing all those 45 years and where did he end up all that time).

10.	 Well thats it from my side, but there are a couple of more minor doubts from my roommate: How did Cooper exist in two places at once? And how did they manage to move the entire population of Earth to another world?

Thank you, guys :) 




 Awesome analogy there.. the comic book thing.. Do you have Youtube videos of webpages for us where we can watch/read the actual explanation by Grant Morrison?? 




 I'm jealous of your nephew. I guess now he would even build up an ambition of becoming an Astronaut! Good for him :) 




  Having the urge to watch the movie again

I just came back from watching the movie for the third time :D 




 That's encouraging!! Thanks 









 ya whatever, man! 




 Happy Children's Day :D 




 In the wake of INTERSTELLAR film, I would like to ask you guys about the books (not Sci-Fi ones) that deal with higher dimensions, alternate/parellel universes, time warp concepts and etc.

Please suggest.
 




 thank you for this... although I guess it should say "more than just a MAN"..  but I guess this version is more unisex... nice.. anyways, this is a motivating piece.. thanks for sharing it here.. 




 Darkly funny! 




 Hey hey hey.. Isn't this form House of Cards :D 




 I've always loved this quote! 




 Fuck.. I just saw my face in this.. This sentence is a fuckin' mirror.  




 Oh didn't knew this... thanks.. 




 Yeah exactly, that's what I meant, they didn't come up with all that themselves.. They took help of a scientist (physicist, to be precise), so I too wanna learn stuff in the same way by taking help of books.. Because I can't afford hiring scientists to teach me stuff.. Hence, this post! 




 I up vote you for just your try... Good luck for the reading habit..  




 Can you please tell me what according to you is hard sci fi? 




 you SHOULD go watch INTERSTELLAR..  




 you SHOULD go watch INTERSTELLAR..  




 Ya.. I recently read this book and was spellbound by the way it was architectured!  




 good work!! 




 After watching INTERSTELLAR, my heart cried in ecstasy!

And, also I've never before seen audiences clap out of respect once the end credits started to roll.. [This is from India.] 




 Thank you so much, man! 




 Why?? Does science not involve the way we live... And isn't family a part of, a very important part of, the way we live on this planet?? 




 Thank you so much for the post! 




 I don't know why people thought it to be a lame quote.. It has a great depth in it, I shall try to give view point of how I saw that quote: 

The evil that arose from *strength* and *power*, when such an evil is prevailing in the world, but if none is to stand up and act against it, if everyone is thinking *weak* and *cowardly* of themselves, such a resistance to act would create more evil because it is fueling it.

In a nutshell, just imagine what would be the plight of Gotham city if Bruce Wayne would've been afraid to become *Batman* and fight it. 




 Hahaha... Correct!! 




 Outstanding! 




 "You call it hope, that fire of fire,
It is but agony of desire." - Edgar Allan Poe

Not that I'm negating the actual post, but looking at your comment I just thought I might as well mention this candid line by Poe. 




 Nice full-form of HOPE.. :) 




 Well thought, pal! 




 Awesome quote.. I'm surprised it only 2 comments till now.. 




 That's pretty much nails it all.. Thank you so much :) :) 




 Hey thank you all so much, guys.. Very helpful suggestions there... I will surely put them to good use :) :) 




 I was thinking such a thing recently.. Thanks for the push :) 




   it's pretty obvious that inhaling exhaust gases is bad for you.

Yeah.. That's what I meant. 




 seriously true and good... 




 haha.. you might laugh so hard that this post can be NSFW..  




  In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.

I have always loved this quote. It speaks so much in this one candid sentence! 




 I commute by Autorickshaws.. 

when a diesel truck or bus passes me, that weird diesel exhaust smell really bugs me.

Yes, this is the trouble... and also one more thing that really irritates the fuck out of me during such rides is the noise of the horns from all those vehicles who want me to get the fuck out of their way. (*I mean, come on, I'm trying to do good to the planet by opting for a cycle, give me some damn place to ride it.*) I had to move sideways and sideways until there is no place left for me to move anywhere. I hated all this experience, this totally removed the joy out of riding a bicycle, for me. 




 I recently bought a Firefox Roadrunner Pro-V.. I decided to commute to office daily on that bike, the distance is 9KM. But only after a week's ride to the office, I felt discouraged, especailly because of the overwhelming amount of traffic I had to face. I'm from India, *the second most highly populated country on the planet.* So, that's kinda seems obvious. 

I work in corporate, and by morning 8AM onwards the traffic sky-rockets in corporate cities (I'm from Pune). InitiallyI tried riding in that traffic, but I observed that every motor vehicle's smoke is comes out onto the commuters who take longer to travel, which is me, in this case, as I had to ride very close to them all. We don't have sepearate roads for bikers in my country. 

So, I felt bad about the kind of traffic I had to ride through. I decided that this is actually bad for my health, inhaling all the pollution from the vehicles all along those 9 kilometers. 

But everyday when I come back to my flat and look at my bicycle in the parking place collecting dust, I feel really bad. This is something I'm unable to turn around in my life.

I would really like to hear about your cycling habits, so that may be I can adopt some of them and make my bike and feet feel worthy. 




 Hey thank you so much... also for the link... Next time when I pick up *Paradise Lost* I shall use this resource!! Thank you so much :) 




 Hey thank you so much for the feedback.. It is very helpful and surely didn't hurt a bit, because my main focus, as far as my "Writing" life is concerned, is not on poetry, it's basically on *fiction.* This poetry pieces are just a trail to drench my thirst, just to see if I can writing nice sounding and rhyming stuff. That's all. Apparently, I couldn't.

Anyways, talking of poetry, let me confess, I tried reading epic poetry like *Paradise Lost*, but truth be told, I never *understand* anything in those epic poetic lines, but then sometimes among them I used to find some really awesome powerful *quotes* kind-of lines, which made me keep going if only for searching more of such lines.. 

Why I'm telling you all this is because you really seem to have great knowledge on poetry related works (you even mentioned that your academics are related to this field). So I want to ask you for help. 

Please help me with an explanation on how to read epic poetry?? I mean, I literally Googled for a verse/prose translation of Paradise Lost. *How freaking weird is that* - to search for the English prose translation for a work already originally written in English itself! I mean, come on, what kind of idiot does such a thing.. I did it. Because I was unable to figure out even a single sentence clearly.. 

Now, tell me what am I supposed to do about all this?? I really want to read great epic poetry, like Paradise Lost, Divine Comedy, The Aeneid, Beowulf and etc..!! HELP.

**Note**: English is not my first language, I'm from India.
