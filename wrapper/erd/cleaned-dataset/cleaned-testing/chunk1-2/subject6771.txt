I'm still on the fence about the validity of these findings. Have cancelled figures complete w/ cardbacks ever made it the sales floor before? And they're selling them at 20$ a pop. 


 Following our earlier story, Brendan sent in detailed [images](http://www.rebelscum.com/2015/Found-In-The-Wild.jpg) of the Legacy Collection Droid Factory figures he found at retail. Looking at the date stamp on the card backs, these figures were produced on October 10th, 2012. They were found for $19.99 each at a Go! Calendars outlet in Pooler, GA, which is promising for everyone in the U.S. interested in finding these figures since it is a nationwide chain.
