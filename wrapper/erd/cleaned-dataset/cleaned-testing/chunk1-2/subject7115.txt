 The voices told her it was okay to attack people because its all just for fun. 




 The only reason I like the Sith more than the Jedi is because of their ability to shoot force lightning out of their fingers. I wish I could do it. 




 She doesn't have a home. Alderaan was destroyed by the Death Star. Thanks for bringing it up...She was finally getting over it. 




 Totally. Right on. 




 Zero fucks given 




 Sounds like my typical weekend. 




 Go to bed grandma. 




 Dang. You beat me to it. 




 IT'S OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In the delicious category. 




 Serves him right. 




 I find this incredibly arousing. 




 Stupid 




 It's more funny if anything. The little girl in front row to the left looks funny.  




 Monopoly is over man. Ended on the 22nd. 




 No? It just looks like people spending time at the beach and someone snapped a picture of their friend laughing.  




 Legendary 




 This is amazing 




 I'm so sick of seeing this one. I've seen it 6 times on r/wtf 









 I feel as if I saw this last month 









 He's rather attractive. 




 When did we rename the Internet "the mall"? 




 Some men just want to watch their hair burn 




 do you get what kind of plant it is? 




 There are very few things I wouldn't do to this man. He gets me so aroused just by looking at him! 




 Thank you! 




 I caught that a few months back. I had a Disney day and watched Hercules after The Lion King and laughed my ass off. Fuck you Scar!!! 




 He's from the UK and represented Britain in the Olympics. 




 Video killed the radio star* 




 You're right. They discovered that its actually animal skin. Not human. 




 I like the altered one better 




 I would do more than that to him 




 This is the repost of reposts. I've seen this at least 5 times a week for the past two months. 




 It doesn't look like him though. I know who he is but that's not him. 




 It was just south of Arizona. They found him in a ditch shot in the head. They caught the one who took his truck and by that time they had loaded it with various weapons and tons of blow, transporting it. 




 Someone posted a picture of this guy walking around outside a couple days ago. Who is he? 




 Sleep? Not for me. Because spiders. 




 Agreed. My uncle was killed by cartel members when he was on a business trip. 




 Nicki looks so good. 




 It's definitely animal (obviously) but I can't tell what kind. It looks like a plant eater though looking at the teeth. But then again I can't for sure tell due to quality. 




 Unless there is strong, hard evidence to suggest it is in fact related to the Nazis, this is not what you think it is. I agree that it might be Masonic or depending on the age of the building, just might be coincidence if the building is older than the 1930s. 




 I see dinner 




 Anyone want to double stuff her? Anybody? No? Me either. 




 That looks like my ass. Maybe someone photoshopped some ass cheeks on this lady's tits. 




 I like the first comment. She thought she was all cool correcting the word. 




 This is so SHOCKING.   




 I can't stop laughing at the reactions of all the people behind them. 




 It looks like it's most likely the umbilical cord. 




 It's not a swastika. 




 Obviously not everyone knows it, for example this post. 




 It looks like a Pokmon. 




 I agree. It's a gap. 




 Thank you! Someone knows what that symbol really means and how the nazis perverted it. It's origins go way back and people don't know it means something completely different. 









 Is this from a movie? I feel it is and I've seen it. 




 This gif would do better in wtf 









 My pants just got shorter 




 Pretty sure I'd be arrested for public nudity because I'm not inside all day, like you. But let's just end this because I'm sick of seeing your name pop up on my inbox. Last time I'm replying to your stupidity. 




 DAT BREASTMILK 




 No. I slept. Like a normal person. Because I'm not up all night harassing people on reddit. I have a life. 




 You do too. 




 And again, I don't care. 




 You're so sweet. 




 Do you honestly think I care? Because I don't. 




 I would still shake the hand of whoever tricked me. He/She deserves a congratulations in my book. 




 I give you that, but bacon. That's all I need. 




 She still looks white. That's enough for the media to feed off of. 




 Uh, yes Houston, reading you loud and clear. It seems you don't quite understand sarcasm, over. One small joke for me, one big step over your head. 









 This is...FANTASTIC. 




 It looks like an outfit Sasha Baron Cohen wore in "Brno." 




 Reminds me of the sculptures from James and the Giant Peach that they made out of all the mashed peach. 




 I would be disappointed if I ran to get this mystical "free beer" and discovered it was just a clever way to get my attention to go inside. Then I'd just laugh and buy a beer anyway to commend them on their trickery. 




 This made me cringe. 




 It's shopped 




 It's true. Whenever pretty white girls do anything, America puts all the attention on it. Attractive white people are the news. Everyone else gets pushed aside. 




 It's not even funny. That person is dead and it's rude to make fun of dead people. 
























 I got dumped a couple of weeks ago for the first time after 8 months with my first ever boyfriend. I had never been in a relationship with anyone before, nor had I done things with a guy so he was my first everything. I even ended up giving him my virginity because I thought I was ready. I don't regret it. But I just still have a lot of emotion towards the breakup and keep trying to tell myself I'm past it but it really hurt my self esteem. I'm a bigger guy and so it was hard finding my first relationship and took a lot of time and hard work. I'm 19 and I just can't figure out how to get past it and rebuild myself. All my confidence is gone and I don't know many other gay guys to ask. Please be nice. Thanks. 









 Exactly. 




 Those feels. They hurt. 




 I upvoted because you're cute 




 The red brick road leads to death, disease, anguish and sadness. There's also cookies and milk. 




 Do I see egg clusters from flies or just puss? 




 I don't get it. Is it wtf because its the same? 




 Yummy! That hair! ;) 




 How did it happen? This makes me so sad.. 




 WHAT?!? 




 He can keep playing with those joysticks he has. I'll take the one in his shorts. 




 This is fucking hot 




 Stalin had an iconic mustache yet people still wear the style and he was worse than Hitler and killed millions more than the Nazi's did. Sadly, I admire his mustache. 




 I'm gay and I just got pregnant. I'm scared but I'm keeping it. Take that nature! 




 This is how I feel on all three dating sites I'm a member of, and in real life when I ever get any courage to try and ask anyone out. 




 He gets me all sorts of hot and bothered 




 Decomposition. You'd look like this too if we left you out somewhere to rot. 




 A woman who fucked up cooking?! This is an abomination! 




 Nothing funny about this but damn they're hot! 




 Did you think it meant January 1913? 




 I'm assuming you think that flesh colored thing right under the kangaroo is a ballsack. You're blind. It's a foot. Otherwise, what the fuck are we looking for? 




 I ain't saying he a gold digger... 




 Buddha hand. They smell fantastic. 









 So jealous! 




 Hot damn! 




 Totally a bag from a box of wine. I've done it at parties. 




 Can I marry him? 




 Dark Helmet from Spaceballs. Very nice. Love that movie. 




 Source?? Please!

 There is nothing significant in this photo 




 I think he's trying to get into porn or he might have already done so. Anyways, he's fucking attractive now. 




 Ahhhh, Hispanics 




 I think he likes you. With his penis. 




 I honestly thought this was a man who had put on fake boobs. 




 It actually is a legitimate photo taken during a paranormal investigation of the Amityville murder house. It was taken in the 1970s. 




 Yeah, with no explanation your picture makes absolutely no sense. But since I now know, I can say she's stupid. 




 Agreed 




 Nice makeup. It looks good...but obviously not good enough. 




 Try posting a picture of your mother. Wait. That's what this is. Never mind. 




 Could help with sex 




 I'd bang 




 How about attention whore who probably has daddy issues 




 Looks like Amanda forgot to clean out her locker. 




 Just broke up last night. I can't wait until I no longer care. 




 He looks like Wall-E. 




 It's all a matter of food distribution.  









 I did too. And I'm a man. 









 No. Too late. It's been posted quite a bit already. 




 It's a repost. Trust me. I made the same mistake... 




 There are people with thyroid conditions which causes them to gain weight uncontrollably even though they have a healthy diet. 




 Apparently someone already put this up. I didn't see it on here so I thought I was the first person to post it and then learn that someone beat my by an hour. Dammit. So I have to call my own post a repost. I'm so sad.. 














 I agree. It looks pretty good. 




 She didn't choose the wookie life. The wookie life chose her. 




 Where do people get all these photos of my family?! 




 Last year when I spent Halloween in College Station, I got into two car accidents with the same car and had it break down. Then proceeded to push it half a mile into a parking garage. The car was also covered in puke. The worst part about my night? I was sober. 




 Dammit grandma! I said later!
