 Looking for non-rooted stuff, GO Backup came up as an app that will save your contacts, messages and apps. Must have root to save app data, but if all you need is a way to easily save and re-install favorite apps it seems good enough. Lots of other options if you do a little searching. 




 Yeah, and it isn't even complete. I use Titanium Backup myself, and there are other options for restoring favorites.

But if you want to re-download favorite apps from the play store, try this...

Click the My Android Apps tab

Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click My Orders   Settings

There you'll find your most recent downloads/purchases. Keep in mind it shows all store stuff, so books, music, ect. will be there as well. And if you click the settings in there you can adjust your device list.
 




 That's probably the best bet for most folks. Installing anything other than from a providers site or the play store can break your TOS. Even taking your phone in with the Unknown Sources box checked can break it. 




 Those are all neat launchers. Another one I really liked was Rocket Launcher, but mostly because it seemed to confuse most folks. :)
SPB Shell was a *really* nice launcher for showing off my phone. The idle screen is unparalleled. 




 ...is that a llama up there? 




 Yeah, I'm digging the whole ICS experience myself atm. But I've been using Holo over the other ICS launchers. I was using Apex so I could put widgets in the dock, but they're just unsightly there. With Holo I can still put folders in the dock (which gets rid of my need for Folder Organizer) and I'm loving the app drawer. The favorites tab is my goto spot to launch apps from.
The current favs atm for ICS seem to be Apex and Nova. 




 Yeah, I didn't really want to put up the market Chinese link, it's still in the xda thread if someone really wants it. It's still one I haven't tried yet, though. I'm a Holo fan atm. 




 There are a ton more, but most link to other sites, are other languages, or simply too shady for me to feel comfortable with pointing anyone to them.
Personally, I mostly stick with the Play Store and Amazon for the free daily apps. I only made this list out of boredom one day, and haven't put much into updating it like the others. 




 Thanks, I've got more hours than I can count into these (mostly the launchers) but I'm going through the browsers now and hunting up more. 




 I try to keep the lists updated and as comprehensive as I can. Didn't see anything here, so I thought I'd share with the redditors.

 You're most likely going to need a task manager, like Tasker or NVC Task Launcher.

 Training Day is one of my favorites. But, damn, there are a *ton* of good cop movies.

edit: the more I think of it, the more great ones come to mind. L.A. Confidential is probably in my top 20 of all time movies. Fallen is rather cool, too. 




 Beat me to it. I've drilled for quite a few of them. And I've seen some churches hide cell towers in their steeples. Any way to disguse them, they're doing it. Folks want more and better coverage, but don't want to have to look at them. 




 Nope. I can see it, though. I'm pretty sure you're family was killed, and you're flashing back to the past all the time. I can't remember if the whole thing takes place in your house or not, but it's very dark, gothic, and weird. 




 I'm pretty sure that's not it. 




 Aargh, I know this game, hold on, I'll think of it...

 Huh. Guess we're screwed. 









 So, you're putting quantity over quality. You're spending so much of your time and resources on making bigger and better looking games that you're surpassing your ability to do them correctly. But as long as people keep eating them up you can move on to the next project feeling justified, I guess. 




 I was working off the Chesapeake Bay and it was below 0 at night. I left my water sitting on my rig and when I saw it the next day, I wondered why it wasn't frozen. The moment I picked it up it froze solid in less than a second. Everyone left water bottles out that night. :) 




 Best Part: So many things. It's unreal how it changed my life.

Worst Part: The scary times. Serious accidents, illnesses, when I'm in a public place and I don't know where she is for a moment or two, etc. That feeling of dread is far worse than any I've ever felt for myself over the course of my life. 




 lol 




 Get someone who knows about such things to install a remote kill switch for the car, and give the remote to your brother. When he knows she shouldn't be driving, he just clicks, and they go nowhere.

Realistically, though, you could have just about anyone who knows about cars put in a regular hidden switch that keeps the car from running. When someone knows she shouldn't drive, they sneak out to the car and flip the switch. Bet it wouldn't cost ten bucks. 




 Um, sounds about right to me. What's your gripe? 




 No, but I have a few I use. Which one I use depends on what kind of comment I want to leave. 




 lol All vid games are like that. But I guess it's all about how you use them. I play here and there, maybe a couple times a week. 




 You mean it's finally dead? Woot! 




 Meh, no. If the ads look like Resident Evil to me, I'm pretty turned off. I'm sure it's "not the same game at all", but it's rare that a FPS game can grab me. Or worse yet, a third person view when you simply shift from target to target with an auto-aim. They all really get monotonous.

I'm pretty hooked on the MMORPGs. I've tried tons of them, paid and free (and there ARE a ton of them.) Dealing with people makes for a much richer experience to me. (For whatever reason, the biggest one, WoW, bores the hell out of me though.) 




 PC only here, too. But I enjoy TF2 quite a bit, still. My game of choice, though has been the same for 6 years, City of Heroes. 




 Sorry :( the best I can do now is toss you an upvote...

 Looked like it could be. I clicked the pack instead of the single, saw it was still under ten bucks, so decided to go with it. Surely, thinks I, there must be a couple people who would like to try it out... 




 Got 3. First come, first serve... 




 Too many of you are bitching that it's light beer. A couple of my favorite American beers are light. You don't need heavy lager to get good taste. That's not the problem here. A beer fan drinking Natty Light is like a wine fan drinking Thunderbird. Cheap as hell? Sure. But it's not worth drinking that crap for the extra cases they're getting, not to mention the blow to their social statuses. 




 Amen. 




 ...can I have the coffee mug? 




 *cough*TheVeronicas*cough* 




 lol I think you win. 




 You can sort according most any criteria you wish. I have almost 300 in my instant watch queue, and this is a god-send. It doesn't just sort it in your browser, it sorts the queue itself, so when I start up Netflix on my Google TV, it's sorted by genre first, then in alphabetical order (my preference.) 









 I played it a lot back in the day on my Tandy 1000sx (dual disk drives woot!) but never won it. I'm trying to find a copy of it, but coming up with zilch. Anyone have any ideas?

edit: NM, it's freeware now with it's own site. I quit looking too quickly. 




 Also, steam has awesome holiday sales, not to mention weekly sales on random games. If you decide to go with steam (which I'm loving) make sure to only buy the games you absolutely must have now until you see them on sale.

I think I got over a thousand bucks worth of games this past xmas for less than 200 bucks. I can't remember buying anything less than 75% off, and still have more than 50 or 60 games I haven't even tried yet. 




 Capital One is probably the biggest credit card company. And if you can't get one there yet, get a secured card, by someone like Orchard Bank. Capital One will send you an invite soon if you balance that one well.

If you get a card, use it. Put 30 bucks a month or so on it, or just use it for gas, or something like that. Don't just start using it for shopping. You can quickly get pulled under, then the charges start.

And make sure you pay it off on time, every month. Finance charges are how they make their money, and they make a LOT of money. Those charges will be like throwing your money out the window while you drive down the road.

If you find out you don't have the self-control to use a card wisely, then cancel it quick, and stick with a secured one. 

Just google around a bit for credit advice. You'll see the smart tips being repeated if you spend the time to really dive into it.

And JReitman is right. Don't use them if you don't have the cash to cover them. 




 Never played it. When Majora came out, we were too busy with other stuff to even turn on the TV. It was a few years before I got back into gaming. 




 For a while now he's been all about using his computer as a media center with all the other TVs hooked into it. He lives in a lake house on a lake in Kentucky (his retirement home.) And he's just out of the hospital from some sort of lung infection + pneumonia (on-going problem, had half a lung taken out years ago.) I'm trying to figure out something other than my old standby present, a Hickory Farms assortment pack. He loves them, but surely he'd like something new, and I'm at a loss for ideas really. Got any good suggestions? 




 Zelda's Ocarina game was great on 64, too. Plus I drove myself batty on Shadowman because I didn't see the ledge next to the gondola for at least a week. My friends and I played Perfect Dark all winter one year during lay-off.

And I think I agree with most of [this](http://ign64.ign.com/articles/081/081042p1.html"Loved me some Banjo Kazooie!") list. 




 I was just debating this myself a couple of weeks ago. I went with a written one. I've found that I'm much more likely to jot down a note than to open a program or app and type something in. When I was using Google Calender, I found myself having to put it off until it was convenient to do so, only to end up forgetting to do it. Plus, it's just quicker. 




 [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Damazontv field-keywords=seasame+street x=16 y=18) has a few on pay per view, and plenty more on dvd. [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiSearch?oq=seasame+street ac_posn=-1 v1=seasame+street search_submit=) has some, too. Free, though, I don't know.
 




 Cool peanut butter use: The next time you have chili, take a slice of bread, coat the top with peanut butter, fold it in half, dip it in the chili, and be utterly amazed at how good such an odd combination of foods tastes. 




 Everything I've tried has resulted in low frame rates. :( 




 At first I figured that it'll be little more than a chat channel for whatever teams join, since I'm sure you won't be able to keep a window open with all members in it. It would be huge. Though I'm sure such a window will be available. Just not practical during gameplay.

But what would be awesome is if when you joined the league, it recommends you to join such and such team, attempting to balance the teams out, distributing healers and tanks and such. 




 I remember those. However, I never knew anyone who actually bought one. 




 So much for my paying attention to things while on a game break. So in i20 we can form leagues? Essentially 48 member teams? Has anyone seen how this is going to work? 
























 Here, take a look at [this good rooting q a](http://www.androidcentral.com/rooting-it-me-some-qa). 




 I have the defender for my X2, and it's a freaking beast. It's big and bulky, but I can't imagine anything else that could protect my phone as well. If you have genuine concerns for your phone in a work environment, this will allay them.  




 Yeah, there might be better rss readers out there, but the few I've tried so far all have some major limitation, and currents works fine for me. This is one of the very few categories of apps where I really haven't bothered to explore alternatives. Guess I have time to browse the market now, though...  




 ...you see reddit as lawful good? It's a screwed up system where quality and genuinely interesting is buried by, well, stuff like this.  




 Well, according to my favorites list, I use Tapatalk, Google TV Remote, and Currents the most.

But it feels like I should say ROM Toolbox, Root Explorer, and MyBackup Pro. 




 That's almost the only reason I always root my phones, so I can flash new and different ROMs. It's true, you can do a whole lot of customizing without root, but I've found it to be just plain fun, not to mention it *does* increase your options for apps and the such. 

That being said, when I got my last phone, I waited until I was certain that if I rooted I would be able to get back to stock. If something were to happen to it, I would want to get it back to original condition for the sake of insurance. 




 Oh. Or that. 




 Well, I would assume that it's smart enough to realize that home is the location where the phone spends the night. And even if it wasn't, I would also assume that you can adjust things manually. 




 Yeah, it's good at what it does, but it's not going to save you much from where you're already at.

However, I've always loved the location part of JD. It used to turn on my WiFi when I pulled up to the house, and turn it off when I left. The same with other common hotspots I frequented. 




 Well, usually flashing a ROM will, or some adb stuff even (though you need to find out exact commands and whatnot, probably from xda). If you're trying to delete various types of data, there are usually apps in the play store that will delete different stuff on your phone.

But a factory reset simply wipes out user apps, settings, etc. It doesn't wipe the phone back to factory new. All kinds of stuff get left on it. 




 Well, since starting a sg costs nothing but a bit of time, someone start one up somewhere. Hell, I'll start it up if y'all want, but I know next to nothing about base building. 




 Well, if you're running stock and haven't flashed or rooted or anything, and you're getting random reboots, then take it to your carrier. Should be their issue to deal with (assuming you keep your insurance up). 




 Well, yeah, it mostly does. However you installed the app after the reset, so the reset can't have an effect on the app, see?

If you just uninstalled and reinstalled to fix it, then it was just a bad download/install the first time around. 




 Sooooo.... are you promoting this app that apparently the guy doesn't want you promoting? 




 There are literally a ton of home launchers. If you're wanting to keep the ICS feel, go with Apex, Nova, or Holo. 




 What sucks is that it still tops out at 20 pages, so I can't see past D. 




 Go to www.cerberusapp.com, log in, click "Help" at the bottom, then click the "I have a rooted device. Can I get additional features?" part.

edit: I'm glad you brought it up, I didn't realize I didn't have it enabled either. Do now. I had to go the .apk route, maybe because of dual sdcards.

This is what MatroskaDiag tells me. 




 Tried it. How do I find out what the actual video codec is?
 




 After codec/pack after codec/pack (mostly from download.com) failing to play .mkv files, I finally found one [from cccp project](http://www.cccp-project.net/) that will at least let me see the files with WMP 11 (32 bit Vista), but they still won't play. They all show as having a length of 0 seconds. I know the files are fine, they play great in the KMPlayer, but I need WMP to be able to play them in order for my Revue to see them over the network. I've been Googling, installing, unistalling, etc. for 3 hours. I'm officially disgusted. 




 Not that I can notice. 




 Always hit the menu key when you're looking for something, even if it doesn't seem like it would do anything where you are.

For instance, when you're in the WiFi settings, you can hit menu again for more options. This is where I always go after a flash to keep WiFi on even when asleep.

 Well, make sure your family members have your work phone for emergencies, and turn your phone off. Check it on breaks. People survived before cell phones, you know. 




 Not mine. 




 I am a beautiful person. (Just installed it the other day, so it's basically the default.)

And I turn that option off, I'd rather hit the words at the top than have it auto-correcting what it wants me to say. 




 That is a good idea, for Android and PC both. 




 That's what I'll do from time to time. but I never stick with the same look more than a week or two. 




 xda can be another good friend. 




 I hope you're not considering CM7. Back stepping there (well, diagonally maybe). [Look through xda](http://forum.xda-developers.com/search.php?searchid=35505095) and see what they have to say about it. Bet there are a ton of comments already. 




 Honestly, that would be annoying enough to me to simply abandon the widget for another from the play store. I am absolutely positive that you can find another you would find more appealing. 




 
Actually, I would probably just split my time going through the basics of operations, through the options on the phone, and through some of the play store apps. 




 Doesn't mean it doesn't work. :) 




 Noted and fixed. You're right of course. 




 lol Thus the list. *With links.* :) 




 Well, besides word of mouth around the forums, I've had a couple Verizon techs tell me this. While it doesn't necessarily mean it's true, it makes it kinda hard to discount.

 ...there's a sentence I never thought I'd stumble upon... 




 SD Speed Increase is always good thing on a fast card. 




 Well, it depends on the device. My little Ascend is unbrickable, but my Strat can be bricked if you're not careful. I thought I had bricked my Droid X2, but after a couple hours of trying to boot into various modes and dozens of battery pulls I got it back. The fact is you *do* need to be careful and certain of what you're doing on various devices. 




 Yeah, I threw it on when iammolotov mentioned it wasn't there. Big oversight on my part there.

edit: OH! Durr, I was bouncing around then so much I lost track of where I was. 




 I actually thought about doing something like that, but my tastes definitely go against the grain.

I can tell you GO Launcher is pretty much the king of GB, but quite a few folks love ADWLauncher EX, Launcher Pro, and Zeam, and Nova and Apex launchers rule ICS. The bulk of the rest of them are pretty much the same, with different options within each that tailor to different peoples needs. In launchers, I put a little list at the top of launchers that are really different from the rest.

With browsers, there are a lot of good ones. Opera is probably the favorite, with lots of Dolphin users. Chrome is really popular on ICS.

As far as app stores go, Play Market is the only one, outside of providers' own apps, that won't break your TOS. Amazon has a lot of followers, mostly due to the free app of the day. GetJar was getting really popular until they dropped their free Gold apps. SlideME and soc.io mall have a few followers, too. 




 Just remember, read, read, read first. Make sure of what you're doing. If you brick your phone (I don't know how easy yours does) you're 100% out of luck (unless you get creative with your insurance...) 




 Insurance? Eh, I don't know.

But to learn to root, [check out what xda has for your phone.](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1603905) 




 Yeah, same with me. I've been using Beautiful Widgets and Recast for my clock and weather, but just switched back over yesterday to HDWidgets. 




 You mean WiFi, don't you? If you're not wanting to use something like Skype, you can use a VoIP app like GrooVe IP. 




 By the way, did you go to the Play Store and simply put in "theft"? 




 Well, for one it will void your Terms of Service, so you can't turn it in if there are any issues unless you flash it back to stock. But the amount of things you can do and apps you can use is greatly increased. 

Myself, I use Cerberus also. 




 Pretty much any VoIP app will. My favorite is Groove IP because you don't need some 3rd party VoIP server. 




 Ok, I put in the link for SlideScreen 2.0 beta that they released openly, since they're not supporting it anymore. 




 Some of my must-have, un-rooted, Play Store apps are...

 Right with you there. I really liked Claystone, and was unimpressed with TSF. Updates for both would be welcome. 




 wtf... lol Glancing over it I'm seeing Crome as Chrome. Nice catch, thanks. Fixed.

And I thought about putting in the rating, but once the list got large I put in the Android version required, and that took a long freaking time. So I put off the notion of adding ratings due to time and/or laziness.
