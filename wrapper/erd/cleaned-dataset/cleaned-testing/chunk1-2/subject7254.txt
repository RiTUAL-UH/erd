 Only in a liberal's world is regulation called freedom. 




 Don't worry.  Job applications have been sent to ISIS so they will cancel these plans. 









 The petulant boy king speaks... 




 The Patriot Act wasn't about patriotism. It was about control.

The Affordable Care Act wasn't about affordability.  It was about control.

Net Neutrality isn't about neutrality.  It's about control.


Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free. 
-Ronald Reagan

 




 Those pesky facts are finally surfacing.

But, like Jay Carney said 9 months after our men fought for their lives all night long as no fingers were lifted in Washington,

"Benghazi was a long time ago." 









 100 inches of snow in Boston.

The most ice on the Great Lakes in recorded history.

Longest period without a hurricane hitting the US mainland in recorded history.

But:
Up is down.  Down is up.
Any dissent of newspeak will not be allowed.
Forward, comrades! 



















 I'm sure his next speech will cover the epidemic of black-on-white murders, robberies and rapes in America.

No, he'll just worry about people's speech. 




 You actually believed that? 




 Oh the ways the elite reddit intelligentsia ties itself into logic knots justifying the non-stop corruption and lies of the Democrat party. 














 Pai asks. "Can you think of any regulated utility like the electric company or water company that is as innovative as the Internet?"

The Internet is the strongest entrepreneurial force in the history of the world and the last bastion of pure freedom.  Leave it unregulated! 














 "Under my plan of a cap and trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket"

Barack Hussein Obama, 2008 









 You're right, giving people money to do nothing will teach them to feed themselves. /s 









 Seem to have struck a nerve here!
How's that fundamental transformation working out for you?
50 million people on foodstamps?  Yes we can! 



















 She knows. She's just establishing dominance. 









 Liberals love the 14th amendment, equal protection under the law, except when it applies to the rich.

Then they want to apply disproportionately high income tax rates on people simply because they make more money.
 









 Yes, the Third World is colonizing the United States.  If you oppose this, you are "racist". 




 There are many sources who say Morsi was not legitimately elected and was chosen to appease the MB.  

But that's nice of you to support a terrorist dictator who immediately begin attacking non-Muslim minorities when he began to rule.

 




 "The tensions between the two nations have escalated in the last 18 months after the Obama administration suspended the sale of certain weapons to Cairo in the wake of the Muslim Brotherhood leaders removal from the presidential office in Egypt."

Yes, Obama supports the terrorism-connected Muslim Brotherhood.
It really can't be any more obvious.
 














 No one has a Constitutional right to buy flowers from you. This is not a freedom of speech issue for the couple. 




 The US Congress was not involved here.  Did you read the article? Having the Legislative branch of the federal govt involved in the sale of a bouquet of flowers between private citizens would be the antithesis of the Constitution and any notion of a free state. 




 Who are really the intolerant ones here?
In a free country you would be allowed to chose who you do business with. 



















 Will your opinion change when they are on your continent?
In your country?
In your state?
In your hometown?
In your neighborhood?

The civilized world is going to need those 3 percenters again.
 









 Anyone else think it's a little Orwellian to have an 'Education Minister' ?

Absolute power always corrupts.  Remember this when you support the Dept of Education's control over our schools. 














 Another over-promoted, disconnected elitist. 














 This is significant analysis.  No one else has mentioned this anywhere.  The definition of "significance" should have nothing to do with volume of original content, but the..uhh..significance of the content.

This is not rehosted content, but a unique and profound observation. 




 I am Barack Hussein "I will stand with the Muslims...my Muslim faith...civilization's debt to Islam...Muslims have built the very fabric of our nation...the Muslim call to prayer is one of the prettiest sounds on Earth" Obama, and I approve this beheading. 




 Pulling the race card to avoid tipping on a big check?

Yes, stereotypes are usually true. 




 We need to realize this will eventually affect our lives outside of the computer screen. 




 In before the mass gargling of Muslim semen by the Reddit intelligentsia. 




 Like I said before, I'll take him. 




 I'll take the word of an Army Colonel that has been in combat fighting terrorists against a proven Islamic sympathizer from Columbia University.  But that's just me.

 When you begin your quest to become an American citizen by evading federal and state authorities you should not be allowed to become a citizen. 




 The IRS targeted conservative, American citizens wholesale and Congress did nothing.

Obama enacted executive amnesty to increase the Democrat voter base and Congress did nothing.

There are no more statesmen in Washington DC to represent us, only politicians. 









 Don't worry, it has a nice, cozy word like "neutrality" in it.  What could be so bad about it?  /s

If you believe in freedom, take the red pill and oppose Net Neutrality! 




 "My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government."
-Thomas Jefferson

Keep the Internet free and unregulated! 




 When we quit using the phrase "N-word", you'll know racism is over. 









 You magnificent bastard. 




 The Patriot Act wasn't about patriotism, it was about control.

The Affordable Care Act wasn't about affordability, it was about control.

The Net Neutrality Act isn't about neutrality, it's about control.

The Internet is the most entrepreneurial medium in the history of mankind and the last bastion of freedom in the world.  
Keep it unregulated!   




 Financial collapse?  Yes we can! 









 So who decides what a "reasonable" perspective is?  You? 









 Keep in mind Al Gore said the ice caps would be gone by now. 









 "Those who look behind the curtain do so at their own peril." 




 You'll "solve" terrorism when you "solve" rattlesnake bites. 




 The article fails to mention this phenomenon of systematic sexual abuse has been brought to the UK as a by-product of mass immigration from the third world.

The attackers are almost exclusively North-African, Middle Eastern or Pakistani Muslims.

Celebrate diversity! 









 There are two options to cease continual warfare: surrender or achievement of victory.

Don't let the faint-hearted convince you things are different this time because we live in "modern" ages. 




 "So you shouldn't go blaming the whole religion because a minority of the people are acting like fucking asshats."

You mean like Obama did with Christianity? 









 Obama's right.  We should just sit back and absorb the car bombs, shootings, and beheadings.  We deserve it.  /s 














 "Dominance established"
-The cat 














 Evil didn't stop existing in 1945.



 









 I call bullshit on this story. 









 "...with some fava beans and nice box wine."
 




 If you reward bad decisions, people will keep making them. 
























 and that's how tyranny happens. 




 But....Bush!!! 




 The "most transparent administration in US history".

Riiiiiiiiiight. 




 Obama saying something else is Bush's fault?  When will he start leading?
He is one who **provided ISIS with TOW missiles**.

Also, is there any **single one thing** that Obama likes about America?

This man is not fit to lead a kindergarten teeball team.  He should be put in handcuffs and removed from office. 




 And Democrats want the federal govt in charge of the health system. 














 This is what happens when governments run schools. 




 "The most transparent administration in history."

Yet another lie. 









   United States has been heavily arming an apartheid state that has WMD.

Ahhh, to be young and naive again.
 




 That's easy to say when terrorists aren't firing artillery into your neighborhood. 




 Anthropomorphic global warming is a farce and a political movement to undermine Western capitalist nations.

Devastating periods of climate activity are going to happen, with or without humans present. Consider the ice ages. Glaciers several kilometers thick formed and moved thousands of miles, crushing everything in their paths. There is no scientist on earth that can tell you why this occurred.  There were several interglacial periods of warming, where ice was rapidly melting.   We are probably in one of those periods now.  


Even the founder of Greenpeace stated before Congress there is no scientific evidence of anthropomorphic global warming.   

Relax, the sky's not falling. We don't need more govt control to avert another fake crisis. Sound familiar? 




 Democrats have expanded the federal government every chance they've had.

Obama voters: You've made your bed. Now lie in it. 




 They are not going to release the account number of the US Treasury. 




 You know what I call people who rob stores? 

Thugs. 









 Paging Al "The ice caps could be gone by 2014" Gore. 









 Just because you post things on the Internet doesn't make them true.
Obama is on the verge of enabling a nuclear Iran.  Yes even Democrats are jumping ship on this one.

http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0MB0KF20150315?irpc=932

 




 Please tell me how a nuclear-capable Iran is patriotic and good for America. 









 Health care costs started rising when the federal government got involved with Medicare.  Put the govt out of the equation and market forces will work things out.

Edit: Market equilibrium would never allow a $50 aspirin. Govt intervention  through Medicare is how this initially happened.  Why is the British national pastime queuing? The inefficiencies and bureaucracies of Socialism. 




 Obama is a naive idealogue..  It is fucking insane that we are negotiating to allow a nuclear capable Iran. 




 I read the letter and think it was a great idea. 




 So any criticism of her action is bigotry? It's racism? 
That card is old, worn and a weak argument. 









 But the earth was supposed to be out of crude oil by now.

The polar bears were supposed to be gone unless we curbed energy expansion.

The ice caps were supposed to be gone by now unless we stopped using fossil fuels. 

Acid rain was supposed to destroy the world unless we stopped building factories.

The hole is the ozone layer was supposed to heat the earth unless we stopped using aerosol.

Deforestation was going to destroy the rain forest unless we curtailed Western Civilization's footprint on the earth.

The sky was supposed to fall unlesss we repealed capitalism and submitted all economic control to the state. 




 The intolerance of the left strikes again. 









 Yes. How else do you think ISIS got their hands on TOW missiles they are seen using in their propaganda videos?  

Standing with the muslims? Yes we can!

 This person is celebrating attempted murder of police officers.  If you think this is cool or even acceptable you should probably move out of your mom's basement. 









 They won't stop until they control all facets of our lives.  Tyranny isn't coming in the front door wearing a white hood.  It is coming in the back under the guise of green living. 














 "The lunches are heavily subsidized by the Government"

So these lunches really aren't 60 cents. Someone is paying for them and probably at a high markup/overhead considering they are government funded. 




 Wake up Reddit!  Don't buy this!  Why would Obama support a nuclear Iran?  They have stated the *intention* to "wipe Israel off the map".  Israel is a free and Democratic nation unlike Iran where homosexuals are hanged.

It's unbelievable that any American supports Iran or negotiations with them.  The fact that Obama and Kerry are so passive and even supportive of Russia and Iran is indicative of ethical collapse. 









 But the shooters were such good boys. They DinDuNuffin. 




 Where do you get this reality from?  Most likely you are not a climate scientist, so you get your 'reality' about our climate from a little rectangular screen that tells you what to think,

 




 Who makes up these codes? Who decides what speech in a private setting is not allowed? 














 "I'll have more flexibility after the election."
Barack Hussein Obama to Russian president

Charge him with treason. 




 If you think government is more accountable than the private sector you're going to have a bad time. 




 "Hiding profits in tax havens is one of the most common ways large corporations avoid paying their fair share to the IRS."

You know what's not fair?  Working hard to get somewhere and having to provide free housing, Obama phones, food stamps, disability, education and health care to people who sit around and smoke weed all day.  Most low to medium income people don't understand this because they pay little, none or even negative tax.

Rewarding the unsuccessful and punishing the successful is an unsustainable economic proposition. 




 Don't you mean Russia's actions in Crimea make it very possible? 




 Why is the Secretary of State running a charity while in office? The potential for corruption is high with this one. 









 More excuses for the lies and corruption of the Democrat party.  You will make a good serf. 









 More nonchalance from the Democrat semen chuggers of Reddit. Your nonstop excuses for Democrat lies and corruption will be a double edged sword. 




 More gargling of Democrat semen by Reddit.  
If a Democrat commits a crime, not a big deal.  The rule of law is not important here, just whims of the mob. 




 You now carry a burden so others don't have to. 


































 The root of the global warming movement lies in a big government, anti-capitalist ideology.  When global warming was discredited by data, they swiftly changed to climate change.

Climate change is not about the environment but, like most left of center ideas, it's about societal control and the repeal of capitalism. 




 I'd rather have wrong ideas than outlawed ideas. 




 The author is an atmospheric physicist from MIT.  It looks like you are the denier of science.

Or do you just baaaa that when it fits your agenda? 




 Liberalism: Ideas so good they're mandatory. 
























 The truth will come out about Benghazi.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i4tuuy1jsw

Q: Why was no support **ever** sent while American troops were being overrun? The fought for over eight hours with an unarmed drone overhead watching them die.

Q: Why did we send an unarmed drone and not fighter jets that were **one hour away** in Italy?

Q: Why did Obama go to bed and then fly to Las Vegas for a fundraiser the next morning, all while the Ambassador's whereabouts were unknown?

 I knew before I even looked. 




 "Gov. Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that al-Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not al-Qaida. You said Russia ... the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years,"
-Barack Hussein Obama

This is what happens when you put an amateur in the White House. 




 We can't have black people wandering off the Democrat plantation and thinking for themselves. /s 














 It's good to see the State Dept has time to tweet in between their arms shipments to ISIS. 









 The only thing wrong about this article is the number.  There are 20+ million illegals in the US. Since Obama's executive amnesty and his orders to cease deportations and even apprehensions, they are pouring in.  

Third world status?

Yes we can! 




 They most certainly will not be deported for voting. 









 How about deporting people that have broken our laws and not paid a dime of income tax? 




 Don't you know who occupies 1600 Pennsylvania Ave? 

It's the Chicago way. 



















 The rule of law is no more. 




 Don't worry liberal hipsters.

Your man pajamas, lattes and tolerance will protect you. /s
