 looks like a fun time, i'm in. 




 dat stare 




 i've peed in several places that i'm not allowed to poop.   




 he made a baby man child in computer class?  bravo sir, bravo.  




 why are you wearing my wings on your feet, good sir? 




 just not french canadian, eh!  they talk funny.  like they have peanut butter stuck to the roof of their mouths. 




 Romanianden* 




 i believe you mean Ramen. 




 i also love holding doors for strangers.  the true test is holding a door for someone who is about 20 feet away.  if they pick up their pace they are truly grateful.  either way, a simple gesture can make someones day.  




 is that the stuffed dog from problem child? 




 where do you live?  having lived in south florida (ft laud/miami) for the last 5 years, i must say they have some of the worst drivers in the country.  it's basically canadian tourists vs cuban immigrants on I-95.  don't use your blinker, they scare people. 




 say please and thank you. 




 i recently relocated from fort lauderdale to KC along with my g/f who is a miami native.  she says it's all about layers and a good jacket.  also, as long as your head and feet are warm, you're in good shape!   




 her favorite beatle is a vw 









 i think it's just because you're old. 
























 it appears you received some great info already.

i moved to KC from WI in 2004.  in 2008 i moved to FL for a new job.  i just moved back to KC in july of 2013 because i couldn't stand FL!   i'm so happy to be back in the midwest!

here are a few things i noticed having lived in both states (i lived in boca raton/fort lauderdale area):

1)  the people here are ridiculously nice.  if you make eye contact in public chances are the person will smile or say hi.  
in florida i felt that if i made eye contact with a stranger that they would want to fight or run the other way.  the fake people in So.FL are the worst.  everyone is trying to one up each other.  

2)  traffic.  anyone that has only lived in the greater KC area and complains about KC traffic, you haven't been to FL.  i don't miss the snowbirds or the tourists lost while looking for disney.

3)  cost of living.  when living in FL you're paying tourist prices.  i don't miss waiting for a table anytime i wanted to go out to eat.  

4)  parks.  KC has some amazing parks.  what i experienced in florida was that it was so crowded that parks didn't really exist.  builders in florida would rather put a few high rises and make more money.

5)  the weather.  while people in FL are probably asking how you could leave FL for KS, the weather is very fair here.  people will tell you, if you don't like the weather in KC, just wait a day, it will change.  while living in FL i really started to miss the midwest seasons.  

 




 i ask out of curiosity, why don't you want to pay your own electricity?  i'm sure they take an average of all apartments and sneak that into the rent cost.   




 make sure to stain the carpet on move out day to ensure replacement. 









 i moved from kansas city where i loved living to south florida for a job.  inside i knew the move would be temporary.  after 5 years of living in south florida (ft lauderdale area), i couldn't take it any longer.  home of sunny beaches and shady people.  i approached my boss and CEO and asked to move back to KC and work from home.  they agreed.  i purchased my first home (29 yrs old now) in july and am happier than ever.  i have a great job doing what i want to do and get to work from home.  i would have never gotten this opportunity had i not taken the risk in the first place. 




 i've scratched my forehead many a times trying this maneuver.   




 apparently it's cold in AK. 




 bedazzle wiener 




 needs more bubble blowing and Canadian accent, eh.  




 the San Francisco treat! 




 Clay/Jax = family.  Nero/Jax = 'family'.  regardless, i can't wait for next week. 




 sorry, hypothetically speaking.... 




 how would jax react if he found out nero was responsible for the killing of one of the sons old ladies? 




 he drives it in the snow as well, i believe. 




 lots of random ass grabs and nut taps. 




 if you want a clean kitchen eat at home!
