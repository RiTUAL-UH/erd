 My shower was going normally...and then I had the bright idea to try and shave in a stand up shower. This may sound risky in itself but I've done it before so I thought I was a certified pro at it. So, the arm pits happen without a hitch but then I start on more risky territory. As I'm finishing up  I'm realizing the quality of my razor isn't totally on the up and up. I only paid $6 for 3 so I should've known. But, here we are. I have a partially shaved butt and a bleeding finger. And to top it all off band-aids don't stick to anything wet, so I ended up getting blood all over my towel trying to get out of the shower. The worst part is it all happened at my boyfriend's house. 

*As a side note, my finger took the brunt of the damage from the razor because the damn thing was so flimsy and cheaply put together the replaceable head comes off without any warning.  




 I actually didn't do it for any significant reason...I just like how it looks pointing that way.  









 Thanks for the input! I think you're right. I'm definitely going to cross hatch the color to try to improve it!  




 thanks! I'll give that a try!  









 Just a quick drawing! Hope you like it! http://imgur.com/eAoiBMk 




 Thank you! :) I've never heard of those, I'll have to check it out!  




 No problem! And thank you! :) It actually was, I worked at it over a few day span so it was a fun end to the day. haha. :D  









 I'm actually so pleased with how this came out, I really hope you like it! http://imgur.com/SXzt8zB 




 Hey, it's just a quick little pen sketch with minimal color...and the quality is a little off because I'm lacking a scanner...(a.k.a I took this with my phone) sigh. I hope you like it though! :) http://imgur.com/vwE5kwi 




 I'm glad you like it! And you're very welcome!! 




 It's just a quick pen sketch with a little bit of color...I thought it would still be worth posting. Hope you like it! http://imgur.com/Bgob3O9

 I actually just checked the map and there doesn't seem to be anyone in my area on that map either! The closest to NS is Quebec! :o 




 ohhhhh awesome!  




 No, I'm located in Halifax, NS, Canada!! I definitely can't afford to travel that far!  




 I'm having no luck finding a person or salon in my area that would install syn dreads and I just ordered a set. Eeeeek. Not sure if it's okay to post this type of thing but I need help and no one I know has dreads... 




 thanks! 




 Thanks! I'm drawing every spare moment I have!! haha.(Although that isn't much as I have had a summer job and I'm in an intensive IT program) I'm focusing on dot work designs lately. I find they turn out the best. I've been trying to focus on tattoo-able designs.  I actually did have an artist in mind and got a side tattoo from him but he's never taken on an apprentice...I'm thinking once I'm back to the city I'll go in and talk to someone from the same shop. 
Thanks again for the advice! 




 I'm working on a portfolio to take in and I have a shop in mind but I know nothing about how I should go about it besides that...I'm also very nervous about taking in my portfolio. I feel as though it could never be good enough as I have no actual experience tattooing and I haven't had any training besides advanced high school courses. I really need to also mention that my art isn't "photo realistic" I have a graphical/2D kind of style to my work. Any advice would be very appreciated!  




 thanks! :) 




 I'm looking at starting to use baking soda and ACV instead of shampoo and conditioner...Any really good recipes out there? That are more than the basic mix? Like something with tea tree oil etc. I'd really appreciate any advice I can get on this.  




 sweet, thanks! 




 I'm in Canada so that sucks! haha. and nice!  




 Hmmm, is that in US dollars or CND?  




 That's true, thank you. I was thinking fruits and vegetables, as well as oatmeal without sweet flavoring added would be good places to start. I'm hoping to keep my diet as low carb as possible. And I'm pretty small/female. So my MAX calorie intake is about 1400.  




 But I honestly can't stick to it right now. I just can't sit down, figure out my macros and then plan my grocery shopping and meals off of that. I'm not good at meal prep. That's the main problem I'm having so I'm trying to find foods that are easily prepared. I'm also looking into nutrition bars. But, quest bars are out of my price range at  $40 per 12. so...I'm hoping there's a better alternative. I really appreciate any tips or advice I'm given. I'm still very new to trying to lead a healthy active lifestyle.  




 okay, thanks!  




 Hmmm, its starting to sound like it's worth just waiting til my hair grows out! Do you know if the dreads were successful at 6-8 inches? Like did they end up keeping them and having them look good? 




 my hair doesn't even curl on its own. Even when I don't comb it, no joke. It's crazy straight and fine. 
 




 thank you for the input! I'm still thinking I'll grow my hair out and try to get natural ones in the future. My hair is way too short for that right now though unfortunately. Parts of my hair are only 3 inches. For some reason shaving it seemed like a good idea.  




 I love the look of dreadlocks, I've been trying to grow my hair out to get them forever now. I haven't managed to do it but I'm thinking synthetic dreads would be a good alternative for me because I'm a Caucasian girl with thin/straight hair too. I'm wondering a few things about getting them...Such as how long should my existing hair be in order to put them in? And where should I typically go to get them put in? I've called a few places that offer extensions but no one there knows anything about putting in synthetic dreads...I know a few people that can dread actual hair would they have an easy time putting in syn ones?
