 Agreed. 




 Drapes would be too interesting. 




 Yes. 









 It's've* 




 Oh, you're too kind, dear.  




 I know someone like this. He's a dear. 




 /r/dragonsfuckingcars and /r/avacadosgonewild  




 Examples? 




 My manager who used to work at a casino in Louisiana said that he would see the Duck Dynasty guys all the time and they would lose ridiculous amounts of money on a regular basis. 









 Whoa 




 Studying for math. 




 I remember the first time I played Oblivion. After leaving the sewers, I didn't turn around, so I had no idea the imperial city was right behind me. Just spent two hours walking around looking for one of those damn cities. 




 I think the most interesting thing about a WWI game would be the fact that they combined (at the time) futuristic weaponry with very obsolete strategies. That's one of the things that made the war so devastating. It wasn't only trench warfare, a lot of interesting things could be done with it. 




 ####test 




 They've announced Lobo as the first DLC character. 




 What did your grandmother ever do to you?

Edit: and now my joke makes no sense... 




 It actually works on low and high attacks. I'm not very good at hitting it at the right time, though. 




 I think I'd enjoy MK style mechanics over SF style. Street Fighter has just never really appealed to me that much. Just my two cents. 




 You, sir, are a poo. 




 Actually, a project called "Version Two" was supposed to be made into Battlefront 3. First Assault was gonna be a marketplace game to help fund the soon-to-be Battlefront II sequel. 




 Wait, people don't do that? What do they say now? 




 Yeah, I think it's RMCF, I remember the one in Winter Park, CO had one outside. 




 Man, this is totally shopped. Get out of this subreddit, poseur. 




 Feminists are so conceited sometimes. I swear to god, they think anything to do just with men is an insult to them, somehow. I once held a door open for a woman and she started screaming at me about how I'm doing it because I think she's "weak" and because she's a woman. Bitch, I don't care what gender you are, I was just being polite. 




 Russia isn't, sir. 




 If you want a Star Wars shooter, there's a pretty cool mod for CoD 4.  




 Since I work for mainly tips, fuck you, you can't have my services. 




 And "you all" just takes god damned forever. 




 No one ever said touching boobs was to make WOMEN horny.  




 In Alaska, it's illegal to push a moose out of a moving airplane. 




 Childhood: Reengaged 




 We all know perfectly well that that's a fucking simulator. 




 You, sir, have never lived. 




 Oh, how true this is, comrade. 




 To put it simply, Tolkien really didn't like technology. 




 Wales *is* pretty big, guys. 




 That stupid men think about sex every 7 seconds thing. I just think its a ridiculous statistic that I'm fairly sure was made up on the spot by someone. 




 *ahem* Rage *ahem* 




 "Ahh.. Pop that pussy for a real nigga
Pull out my black card, that's my lil nigga
Make a movie with your bitch, Steven Spiel nigga"

Oh, Lil Wayne... What would we do without you and Steven Spielnigga? 




 I can't blow my goddamn nose. 




 That's an awfully curvy L, don't you think?

Edit: in all seriousness, though, that's pretty cool. 




 My parents and I all thought I was just high energy, then I was diagnosed with ADHD. Aren't logical fallacies awkward? 




 Relevant username. 




 Totally just read that in Nigel Thornberry's voice. 




 Dude, me too. Fuck rainbows. 




 You smiled at your sex as the door shut? 




 As someone who works at a car wash/detailing place, I can relate. I can relate so gooooood. 




 A friend of mine was at the Olympic training center for archery and met Michael Phelps. When he tried to say hi, Phelps just said, "Fuck off," and walked away. 




 Hit the nail right on the head. Exactly how I feel, man. 




 /r/dragonsfuckingcars 




 Same thing with my Granddad's lab. I would stare for a few minutes until I was sure I could see breathing. 




 Canada. 




 I am devastated by how long it took me to get this post.... 




 I don't know about others, but I say it quite a lot. 




 AlienBlue 




 If you look closely, you can see that this is shopped. 




 Oh, my god, you just saved me so many hours of sleep. 




 It's sucking my will to live! 




 Heart disease? 




 Play-Do: Fun to play with, not to eat! 




 That guy must've been like, "WOOHOO! New profile picture!!" 




 That's some Wile E Coyote shit, right there. 




 As a lover of history, if absolutely love to have this. 




 Ah, yes... I've heard of these so called, "flagged posts" 




 Nothing like milking your feet for the fhrer. 




 Much more fuel efficient than racing with cars. 




 Ghost probably pushed him. 




 That, sir, is not an apple, but a larger than average strawberry. 




 Am I the only one who's more interested in who's between his legs?

EDIT: I apologize for my awkward word choice. 




 This is essentially Japan's wet willy. 




 Nice pin stripe! 




 I've been fairly lucky with my first gen PS3 still kickin'. Though the fan sounds like a Boeing. 




 Would a "put.... Put your dick in it" be relevant here?  




 Totally thought a car was gonna hit him at the end. 




 Am I a bad person if I saw black face immediately? 




 I stopped going to the fridge at night because I'd accidently leave the milk in the glass cabinet.... 




 If you aren't making eye contact you aren't doing it right. 




 It literally took me 2 minutes to see the damn goat. Ashamed. 




 The fact that that happened to her is kinda morbid, but the general post is kind of uplifting.  




 Well, from the video he could've easily been white, so you did make assumptions.  




 Put... Put your dick in it... 




 She's cuuuuute. Kinda. Like in a baby kitten road kill kinda way. If it were covered in more dead kittens. And then had that volcano on her face added on for good measure. 




 A Russian exchange student at my school told me it's just highly recommended.  




 "Ur" repetitive. 




 She should go pro! 




 He died instantly.... The next day. 




 I've heard they also have villages where they send people with HIV and AIDS to die. 




 THE TABLES HAVE BEEN TURNED 




 DETAILS 
























 Half-Life. I want them to just say that 3 won't be made so I can be done with it forever. The fandom is annoying, Gordon Freeman isn't really a character, so why should he be revered the way he is, and I'm tired of hearing about it literally everywhere. 




 That band, man... 




 MOTHERFUCKIN' SHIBE 




 So worth it. 




 I Hate Hartley 




 Saw these guys on their first American tour. They were amazing then and have only gotten better! 




 A fire breathing beaver! 




 I never got to see it, what was so bad about it? 




 Shaking hands.... 




 And /r/thecheapestofamazon 




 Contrasumption? 




 We've known Teppei personally for a few years, now. He's a really cool and layer back guy!

Edit: We took him to dinner before the shows every time he came to CO since we met him. 









 I still do. It's the handle, man. The handle makes drinking anything better. 




 Most probable worst case scenario, you YLOD and need new thermal paste. You'll probably be ok! 




 My school had an assembly about it. I had no choice. 




 Wait... Then what the fuck is a berry? 




 It's a collection of all the TF2 comics, L4D comics, and the like for other games. 




 That sounds fucking awesome. Literal all-star cast. 




 Ah, I see you've unlocked the [Butthurt] trait. New player? 




 Thanks for making me realize I don't know how borrowing works... Asshole. 




 Aaaaaaaaand you're a bad person. 




 One of my favorite bands! 









 FUCK YOU, FERD, YOU UNFABULOUS SHIT

Edit: Why the *fuck* do I keep seeing you?! 




 You two will always be at odds.  




 Well, realistically, Tolkien never would've been able to finish it because it's just so extensive. 




 Dammit, I can't handle unfinished Middle-Earth, if GoT is never finished I'll go insane. 




 Yeah, I pretty much said "fuck that" after seeing words like vivacious, bemused, and haughtiness. I learned two of those words last year. 




 Everything on NoSleep is true even if it isn't. 




 Dude... Fuck you. 




 I'm afraid of the beach, oceans, and lakes for this very reason. 




 Tricycles. I am terrified of riding tricycles.

Edit: also, laying on my stomach with my legs hanging over an edge. I'm terrified someone is just going to walk up and break my knees by hitting/pushing my lower legs really hard.

Edit 2: OH! And moths flying into my ears.  




 It's gonna be Cooking Mama X Mass Effect! 




 I thought that was a subreddit and tried exceptionally hard to figure out how it would be relevant before clicking on it. Needless to say, I was disappointed. 




 /r/DIY ? It sounds like it belongs there... But I've never seen a casket on it, so I don't know. 




 Well there's different words for different age groups. I can't remember off the type of my head, but pedophile really only applies to a range of like 7-9 year olds or something like that. 




 What's one of the most fun things you've ever done and why? 




 I agree. Not to mention, I feel like exclamation points make me seem excited, so caps convey anger better. 




 I'd like some recommendations, any genre at all.  If you like it, I'll check it out.

Edit: Thanks a bunch! I'll do my best to check all of them out! 




 I'd like something new to read and I'm not going to say what I've already read in order to get a little more variety. So, bring it on!

Edit: Why the down votes? I'd just like a few new comics to read....

Edit 2: Thanks a lot, guys! I'll try and check all of them out! 




  (`)
LOOK AT IT
Just... FUCKING LOOK AT IT
 (`) 




  (`) 




 I still hate you.... Like, a lot.  




 TIL that the Fire Nation is North Korea. 




 Be honest.... Did you search "period blood?" 




 Why the *fuck* did you spell the numbers?! 




 My current favorite has to be Our Darkest Days by Ignite.

http://youtu.be/pToEaI9TkJI - Bleeding 




 Please provide a link to the album or a song from it! 




 I saw a Prius that said "smuggg" on the plates in reference to the Southpark episode. I thought it was pretty funny. 




 There's nothing fabulous about you, Ferd.... 




 THANK YOU O_O 




 That's my phone's shadow. 









 Ooh! ME! 




 Over yonder! 




 I'm a T Swift fan, myself. 




 With Taylor Swift? She won an award and he jumped up on stage and took the mic from her and started screaming about how Beyonce should've won. It's where the "I'mma let you finish, but..." Joke came from. 




 There was a duffel bag left in the school parking lot and the police were called. All this bomb threat jazz and it was later found out to be a Kermit the Frog doll that was stolen from one of the teachers earlier that year. It is now a school "holiday" where everybody wears green. 




 1497 




 I thought he literally pulled out a quarter and then it somehow broke. I was always confused what the quarter had to do with the situation at hand. 




 Redditors for 334 days... You check out. 




 Will.i.am is just awkward all around. 




 No one beats Liam fucking Neeson in FO3! 




 Well, since I'm all the way down here.... 




 I know a lot of military and they're good people that are going through exactly what we're going through. Don't blame them. 




 It was the same with me. A game with no dialogue or really in depth backstory made me tear up at the end. Only game that ever made me do that. 




 I'd recommend you get Journey and the Unfinished Swan. They're both PS Store purchases and they're amazing. 




 Oh, yeah. My bad. 




 There's an arcade game called T.E.C. 3001. It's awesome.

Edit: Indie* 




 Because it's a heavily anticipated game from a prestigious studio. 




 Well, by your logic, you got your ignorance from your father and you're completely ignorant of the fact. 




 YOU'RE AN AWFUL THREAD 




 As much as I dislike GameStop's way of business, I'd hate to see them go. They have some good stuff and the employees their are some of the best conversations I've had about the video game industry and really nice guys. 




 Completely absurd, my good man. 




 May I partake?


YOU SHIT-EATING, CRUSTY, JAGGED PIECE OF WALRUS ANUS 




 Not exactly what I was looking for, but I still like it! Thanks! 




 Like one that shows off really cool or creative cars, motorcycles, ect. 




 I also think the PS3's Netflix layout is a lot better. The Xbox' is just annoying to use. 




 I saw the thumbnail and didn't read the title... I thought it was an Anchorman 2 picture. I'll just say I was disappointed. 




 In quite a butthurt fashion, might I say. 




 The butthurt is strong in this one. 




 Ah, I believe you meant to say empanada, my good man. 




 I keep getting Serious Sam and Duke Nukem 3D coupons. 




 What's with Guy Fawkes masks and these pictures? 




 I... I take 45 minute bathroom breaks. No one believes that I just don't care enough to get up sometimes. 




 BUT SHE'S ALREADY SAT HERSELF DOWN SO GINGERLY! 




 You need 4 leg holes for 2 penises? 




 Um... Thanks? 




 Um... Thanks? 




 "*Yes.*"
