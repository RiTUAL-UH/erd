 "OP shares accurate information in the hopes that people will be persuaded by what they see."

"...okay?"

"And they're vegan."

"Everyone grab your pitchforks!" 




 People who use nature to justify their actions end up with a society that is red in tooth and claw. 




 When the options are kill fewer animals or kill more animals vegans choose to kill fewer animals. (And of course we should still do everything possible and practical to make the fewer number as low as possible). 

 




 Even if all 96 million cats died from a vegan diet, how many fewer animals would be slaughtered to become cat food if all cats were fed a vegan diet? You cannot choose the most ethical option for feeding your cat without considering all of the consequences of your choice. 




 [Here is a link to the source video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIpCNiq0ibE) 




 Just because I have chosen to provide some care for an animal doesn't mean I can cause any amount of harm to other animals to benefit the animal I have chosen to care for. An animal that is distant, who I won't see suffering, or who has less connection to me or someone I know is no less deserving of ethical consideration than the one that is right in front of me. An ethical person would weigh their interests similarly. 




 Thanks for citing the appropriate wikipedia article. I am doing all of this from my cell phone, so it is a bit tough to look things up. I have read the study you cited previously. I think you have failed to emphasize that none of the vegan cats were deficient in taurine, as well as to provide a reference for the proportion of cats on conventional food with low taurine levels. That said, the study does show that vegan cat owners could better protect their cats' health by choosing a vegan cat food with higher taurine.

I'm also not arguing that the cats will be the ones better off if they eat a vegan diet. Even if all 96 million cats died from a vegan diet, how many fewer animals would be slaughtered to become cat food if all cats were fed a vegan diet? You cannot choose the most ethical option for feeding your cat without considering all of the consequences of your choice. 




 I am saying it is better to choose the option that causes less harm to animals than the option that causes more harm. This is probably one of the  least controversial ethical statements anyone could make. 

It sounds like you are trying to describe a situation where more harm would be caused by letting the dog suffer and die than is caused to a snake to produce a single dose of antivenom. If that is the case I would say the less harmful option is the better one. If it were not the case I would still say the less harmful option is better. 

I am not saying that every scenario is clear cut or that I always know which option is less harmful. However, I have yet to see anyone even attempt to make the case that the animals being raised and slaughtered for cat food are harmed less than a cat would be even if it was fed the worst possible diet. 




 [Here is the source for the 85% claim in the title](http://www.theghostsinourmachine.com/downloads/TheGhostsInOurMachine-ImpactReport.pdf) 




 I'm always hearing about how Americans are becoming increasingly overweight due to their diets being too high in fruits and vegetables.  

/sarcasm 




 Also, why the hell would you claim that vegan diets kill cats 100% of the time due to zero taurine when you knew about a study on the amount of taurine in vegan cat food? 




 Are you saying that taurine levels in all cat foods are too low or do you think that vegan cat foods have less taurine than non-vegan cat foods? Could you link to one of these studies? 




 All vegan cat foods and most non-vegan cat foods are fortified with taurine. [Read about it on Wikipedia](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurine).

We have the nutritional knowledge and mastery of chemistry necessary to overcome that challenge. 




 If it was the case that feeding a cat a vegan diet would cause it to suffer and die 100% of the time, that would still be more ethical than causing 10 other animals to suffer and die. What cats naturally do is irrelevant. The fact that the cat is right in front of you while the other animals will be out of sight is irrelevant. It is still more ethical to choose the option that causes less harm. 




  I'm just concerned with 9 animals lives.

Why aren't you more concerned for the lives of the animals that are killed to become non-vegan cat food? Far more than 9 animals would die to feed 9 cats a non-vegan diet for their entire lives. Shouldn't killing more animals be seen as worse than something that kills fewer animals (if any)? 




 I search YouTube for videos that portray farmed animals in a positive light, or sometimes I stumble across them on Facebook (Mercy For Animals posts a lot of good material), then I use imgur's [video to gif](http://imgur.com/vidgif) tool to turn them into gifs. 




 Subscribe to /r/vegan. People post enough pictures of awesome vegan foods that you will want to try yourself that you will find yourself with very few non-veg meals left.

 I like to think that there is a bit more to my existence than just the cute animal gifs that I share on reddit, but I'll consider my life 80% validated now. 




 Your boyfriend wouldn't just be like, "I'm sure there's a good reason for why you need a picture with a bag of frozen vegetables on your face. I'm happy to take it for you, dear"? 




 I like this answer much better than the actual answer, so I'm sticking with this one. 




 The Life You Can Save, and the other effective altruism work of yours that I have seen, seem to focus predominately on mitigating terrible cases of human suffering, which is undoubtedly an important cause. However, it seems quite likely that each of us can do much more with the same amount of resources to mitigate animal suffering. A good deal of your other work has addressed the issue of speciesism and the importance of animal rights in living an ethical life, but the work on effective altruism within the animal rights movement (for example the work done by [Animal Charity Evaluators](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/)) seems to be more of an afterthought. Why have you chosen to focus much more specifically on humans in your recent work? 




 The way you worded it doesn't really describe his position, but let me Google the answer for you:

Q. You have been quoted as saying: "Killing a defective infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person. Sometimes it is not wrong at all." Is that quote accurate? 

A. It is accurate, but can be misleading if read without an understanding of what I mean by the term person (which is discussed in Practical Ethics, from which that quotation is taken). I use the term "person" to refer to a being who is capable of anticipating the future, of having wants and desires for the future.  As I have said in answer to the previous question, I think that it is generally a greater wrong to kill such a being than it is to kill a being that has no sense of existing over time. Newborn human babies have no sense of their own existence over time. So killing a newborn baby is never equivalent to killing a person, that is, a being who wants to go on living.  That doesnt mean that it is not almost always a terrible thing to do.  It is, but that is because most infants are loved and cherished by their parents, and to kill an infant is usually to do a great wrong to its parents. 
Sometimes, perhaps because the baby has a serious disability, parents think it better that their newborn infant should die. Many doctors will accept their wishes, to the extent of not giving the baby life-supporting medical treatment.  That will often ensure that the baby dies.  My view is different from this, only to the extent that if a decision is taken, by the parents and doctors, that it is better that a baby should die, I believe it should be possible to carry out that decision, not only by withholding or withdrawing life-support  which can lead to the baby dying slowly from dehydration or from an infection - but also by taking active steps to end the babys life swiftly and humanely.

 Of course the legislature should only pass laws if there is a good reason for them. That isn't what this amendment is going to ensure. It will instead provide a basis for large agricultural interests to legally challenge laws they don't like in court. You wouldn't only need to convince a majority of legislators and the governor to pass a law, you also need to prove it to a judge, and if he or she sides with you then another judge on appeal. At the same time laws that favor big ag without good public reason will go unchallenged, and those that only hurt smaller farms that cannot afford the legal costs will go unchallenged too. This is an amendment designed to enshrine big business interests in the state's constitution. 




 You should cut them on the bias. 




 I wasn't trying to suggest that those things were goals of people who have sex with animals. 




 Being natural is completely irrelevant. If humans had been having sex with animals for hundreds of thousands of years and it was more convenient for you to find an animal to have sex with than another human would it be okay then?

Meat isn't easy either. It takes time to cook, it comes with high risk of foodborne illness, most of the world considers it to be a luxury. [Soylent](http://www.soylent.me/) is a vegan option that is incredibly convenient (just add water). You can get nuts at any store, they keep well for long periods of time, and you can eat them right out of the container by the handful. Rice and beans are staples of the world's poor. There is no reason to eat meat other than the fact that you enjoy it despite the terrible harm caused to animals, which is the exact reasoning behind why people engage in the cruelty of having non-consensual sex with animals.

You do not need to eat meat to get enough protein. And just because something happens in nature does not make it ethical.

I also run a small subreddit /r/SummerScavengerHunt. We run a photo/video scavenger hunt on subreddit that will be starting on June 1 of this year. It is a lot of fun, and I encourage everyone to join!

Here are a few of the items people submitted for last year's scavenger hunt:

 PETA is certainly a group with significant shortcomings, but lets not forget that this campaign against PETA is driven by an industry lobbyist group, the [Center for Consumer Freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Consumer_Freedom), with the goal of conflating PETA with animal rights and setting the entire cause back.

Whenever you see these stories, please consider making a donation to a group doing actual work to help animals. [Here are charities that Animal Charity Evaluators has recommended as the most effective for helping animals](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/). PETA does not deserve your money, but animals should not be left to suffer because industry funded interests want to shut their opponents up entirely. 




 I ate a vegetable once, and I almost puked. I don't know how vegans can compare these things to real food. 




  Nothing - absolutely nothing - in that paragraph describes you as a vegan. Nor do you admit that you do in fact have issues with the consumption of all animal products, which to me would be a much more intellectually honest conversation.

When someone mentions that they're vegan reddit's response is, "how do you know someone is vegan? Don't worry they'll tell you." When someone doesn't mention that they're vegan you then try to call them out for not mentioning it.

It seems to me like some people just want to find a reason to get upset with vegans for simply existing.

 The chickens that are in the world today are going to be slaughtered for food, but fewer will be bred to replace them as the demand drops. Huge global demand changes don't happen overnight. 




 Yes, I am a chicken. Just trying to share some info about my awesome brothers and sisters. 




 10 billion is the number of birds and mammals killed in the United States for food every year. 

Roughly 60 billion is the number of birds and mammals killed worldwide for food every year.

Depending upon which marine animals you count, 110 billion could be a total for the number of individuals killed annually for food, but you can also find much higher numbers that count a broader range of marine animals. 




 The article is saying that donating money has a bigger impact than personally avoiding meat. Nobody is saying that then makes it okay to eat meat (except under the hypothetical scenario where eating some meat could lead one to save enough money that could then save the lives of far more animals.) 




 You're citing examples where the person is still doing more harm than good. A more appropriate example might be Batman committing a minor crime to stop the Joker from killing thousands of Gotham residents. Most of us would say the small negative that Batman is committing is justified given the much larger positive. 




 You could send them [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxRIh9R2YfY) as a response. 




 I'll post the gif to /r/gifs and /r/aww. I still need to look into the best subreddit for the ag-gag post. The best way to find them would just be to go to my post history though.  




 I think you did the right thing by including PETA's contributions to this post on /r/vegan, but when it comes to other subreddits I suspect that mentioning PETA's role will make your comment less effective toward the goal of helping animals. Ultimately what is best for the animals should prevail over giving credit where credit is due. 




 I have two posts about NC planned for tomorrow. I'm going to turn the cute opossum eating a grape video into a gif, and I also have a post planned about NC's new ag-gag proposal.

I'll schedule the posts to go up between 8-10AM North Carolina time. I will be fast asleep at this time, but if any of you North Carolinians (or anyone else) are on reddit, make a comment about the animal cruelty exemption for opossums in the comments of the gif post (I would recommend leaving out the bits about PETA's involvement though given how much reddit hates PETA). 




 [Here are the groups recommended by Animal Charity Evaluators for having the biggest impact per dollar donated](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/) 




 It is good that you are reflecting on your mistakes. Every time I have screwed up when discussing veganism/animal rights has been a lesson for how not to discuss it in the future.  




 This article is from March 2014. It seems like some op-ed from a year ago had it right, but now they are ignoring the issue. 




 I'm sure they do sell it in my area; I just haven't looked yet. I don't make many trips to Whole Foods since I already have an excellent vegan selection at the supermarkets that are even closer to me (not to mention much cheaper). 




 The effectiveness in terms of numbers of lives saved per dollar by the top charities on Animal Charity Evaluators are about 10,000 times those of the top charities working for human causes.

Do humans experience 10,000 times as much joy as non-human animals? Do we suffer 10,000 times as intensely? Are our interests 10,000 times stronger? It is admittedly hard to estimate such things, but I don't think any reasonable estimate would be anywhere near 10,000 times.

For that reason I focus 100% of my giving to the charities recommended by Animal Charity Evaluators. 




 I have the same question that the sharks posed at the end. I can find a lot of fancy artisan vegan cheeses in my area, but how well does it compete with the cost of normal supermarket cheese? 




 Lol, you got me cracking up about [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxRIh9R2YfY) all over again. 




 Animals are individuals though.A species might gain a large boost in numbers if humans began factory farming them and consuming them as food, but cows, pigs, and chickens suffer in many of the same ways you would if you were thrust into similar conditions. They deserve respect as individuals, not merely consideration for what propagates a species. 




 I agree with /u/tbhx12345 that OKCupid is better. The choices are still slim, but at least I don't have to look through all 4,000 omnis in my area to find the 40 or so vegan profiles.

 This is like saying, "I'm not a quadrilateral; I'm a trapezoid." Human describes your species, but you are also a member of kingdom animalia. 




 I wonder how many people have tried to message me, but sent a message to the wrong person. 




 Unlike some US states with ag-gag laws where you will get sued and/or thrown in jail for documenting animal abuse at a slaughterhouse. 




 The first letter is actually a lower case L. 




 What is an animal rights group that you think more people should donate to? 




 Just imagine how boring /u/The_Withheld_Name and /u/runnerdood's jobs must be! :P 




 I'm glad other people are looking at those. I was the one who asked the subreddit reports guy to start running the report for /r/vegan. 




 On a more serious note though, chickens are much more than just products. They are individuals who recognize one another and remember past actions. They experience joy from activities such as dust bathing or caring for their young, and suffer when confined on farms or slaughtered. These things have powerful implications about how we ought to treat them. 




 See this is the problem. How are we supposed to improve conditions for chickens when Canadians can't even read an article about the treatment of cocks without thinking about beating their meat? 




 Is /u/kittiesnewyears trying to break my monopoly on pig gif posts? 




 [Mercy for Animals](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/) and [Compassion Over Killing](http://cok.net/) are two excellent groups that conduct undercover investigations like the one shown. Donations to these groups help to publicly expose the terrible cruelty happening inside farms, which does make a big difference in getting the laws needed to protect animals passed. 




 The owner is also an awesome animal rights activist. Definitely a business that I am happy supporting. 




 I monitor usage of the word "PETA" on reddit, and I keep hearing people mention "Peta Jensen". Is that vegan enough? 




 Check out /r/veganrecipes or /r/veganfoodporn if you would like to see examples of how delicious a meat-free diet can be! 




 I should start keeping a tally of how many of my posts find their way back to /r/vegan. 




  I don't want to have my real name associated with everything I do online though.

I remember you giving out your name in the comments of something I posted on /r/vegan about a week ago. 




 I think /u/sap91 just wants people to look at his penis. 




 Your body is only making vitamin D from a very narrow band of UV wavelengths. These same wavelengths also cause sunburn and DNA damage that lead to skin cancer. If you are getting vitamin D from the sun you are also putting yourself at higher risk of skin cancer. Getting dietary vitamin D and protecting yourself from the sun is a much safer option. 




 Sun is better for developing skin cancer. 




 Unfortunately, products marketed as free range are not the idyllic conditions that people picture them to be. [Here is a picture of a "free range" egg laying facility](http://i.imgur.com/8Tv6y7O.jpg). 




 I found your OKC profile. 95% match, not bad. 




 Unfortunately, chickens are not just egg laying machines, and many municipalities have begun having problems with people who buy chickens thinking they are getting a lifetime supply of eggs, but a couple years down the road when the chickens start laying far fewer eggs, these people won't slaughter the chickens, so they just end up getting abandoned. No commercial farm is keeping spent hens for life either, but they inevitably end up getting sent to slaughter. At the same time, if you are buying chickens from a hatchery you are inevitably supporting the killing of many male chicks who are of no use for egg laying purposes. 

If keeping chickens is something you are able to do, look into adopting spent hens as there is a serious need for people to rescue these animals. They are loving companions who deserve and will appreciate your affection, but don't expect to be getting a large number of free eggs out of it. 




 The Certified Humane label means very little. It prohibits battery cages, but all three of the facilities pictured would likely meet certified humane standards. 

Another one of the Humane labelling standards, American Humane Certified, even allows battery cages to still be used as long as they are "enriched colony cages". 




 The cage free picture is from [this Sierra Club article](http://www.sierraclub.org/chicago/sierra/2015-2-march-april/feature/local-roots-vs-industrial-agriculture#8) (for everyone who thinks the EU is better, the picture is from a Belgian farm).

The Free Range picture is from [the Wikipedia article on free range eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-range_eggs)

The organic picture is from [this CBS news article](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trouble-in-the-henhouse-the-scam-of-organic-eggs/) 




 You woke me up for this? You are stating that people put their own preferences ahead of behaving ethically. This isn't news. It also doesn't change the answers to how we ought to behave. 




 I heard two PETA workers were once caught going house to house, killing people's plants and tossing their bodies into a dumpster. People ask them to help thinking that they are good gardeners, but can you believe that PETA kills 96% of the plants they garden?! 




 Are you planning on swallowing it? I remember /u/Zhaey pointed out that there is a lot of debate over whether vegans are allowed to swallow. 




 You aren't really vegancirclejerking if you don't do it for ethical reasons. There is no health reason to circlejerk about leather and wool or to cut your food on the bias. 




 Way to fairly portray his position. I'm sure he wrote, "we should kill babies because they are disabled. No more to that one, that's enough philosophy for today!" 




 That's true, direct action is much broader than just illegal actions, and there certainly are instances where taking actions to directly help animals is the right thing to do. 




 I take action and [I have evidence that my techniques work](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/2xk3fk/february_was_an_effective_month_of_activism_for/). 




 Hostage taking? We don't want a feral child incident. (This is a reference to the movie [Bold Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JToC6l9Xx_c). For those who haven't seen it the film depicts an ALF cell that plans a nationwide string of actions to free animals. At one point in the film the protagonist meets up with an old friend who he had lost touch with, and finds out she had been keeping a factory farmer in her basement, treating him like he treated his animals, and calling him the "Feral Child" while posting videos of it online.)

While I highly recommend the movie Bold Native, I don't think direct action is an effective strategy for achieving the goals we want. In the film the protagonist, Charlie, says, "people will ask themselves 'why are people willing to risk so much to save animals?'" when describing the outcome he hoped to see from his actions. What we really see when these actions take place is people acting like we are the terrorists and simply giving the justification that animal rights activists are crazy as the reason why we fight so hard for the cause.

We need to make the case to people that animal rights matter so that they choose to respect animal rights on their own. Making threats or taking actions against people is not the way to accomplish this. Outreach like what /u/VeganMinecraft is doing, or what groups like Mercy for Animals, Vegan Outreach, and the Humane League regularly participate in is the most effective way to achieve this. 




 According to [this post from /r/dataisbeautiful](http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2fd1gf/protein_sources_by_calories_value_and_portion/) the two cheapest sources of protein by a substantial margin are both vegan. 




 Cows are individuals, not a species. The individuals do not benefit by being farmed any more than you would be better off if super intelligent aliens packed you in a tiny cell, fattened you up, harvested a bit of your DNA to breed more humans, and slaughtered you. 




 If a person existed where the "good" (increase in happiness) that came from them eating a burger exceeded the "bad" (cow suffering and death) then it would be an ethical decision for them to continue eating burgers. Such people don't actually exist, but if they did then the conclusion follows. 

I'm not sure how you see that as a flaw with utilitarianism. 




  favorite words: foods, moral

Jeez, this guy sounds like some sort of preachy vegan... 




 It is edible, but I much prefer Just Mayo and Veganaise. 




 [Mercy for Animals](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/) is an excellent group that has some international presence; although their work is mainly in North America. If you are looking for a truly international group then I think the best option is [Animal Equality International](http://www.animalequality.net/). 




 I do also have Google alerts set up to publish to an RSS feed, which is where I find maybe 30% of my content. 




 There is no one simple way. This particular post I came across because I was trying to track down some other research I had seen previously to respond to someone's comment and I just happened to look into what new research was coming up. 




 [The data from the Physicians Health Study I and Women's Health Study shows that increased egg consumption correlates with higher risk of diabetes.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2628696/)

CONCLUSIONSThese data suggest that high levels of egg consumption (daily) are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in men and women. 




 Those statements are true, but entirely irrelevant when it comes to the answering the question of whether or not consumer choices can influence supply. 




 There are countless examples where demand has declined as consumer preferences have shifted. Nowhere near as many VCRs are being produced today as were produced two decades ago. 

Obviously one consumer or just the United States isn't going to eliminate all global demand for animal products, but if all Americans gave up meat it would make a world of difference for roughly 10 billion mammals and birds per year that Americans would have otherwise consumed. 




 Obviously the animal that has already been slaughtered and whose flesh is being sold at the store will not be the animal who is saved. However, as demand declines, fewer animals will be bred and raised in captivity to meet the lower demand. The animals who are not being born into these atrocious factory farm conditions down the road are the ones being saved by your choice to abstain from meat.

 I was a bit disappointed when I saw what /r/todayilearned was doing for April 1st (I had set my computer up the evening before to make the post while I slept), but I still think things turned out very well overall. Most people seeing the post are just browsing the front page and have no idea what the subreddit is doing today. 




 Wow, thanks. How did nobody catch that sooner?

Link is fixed now. 




 Why are you shouting? 




 He isn't saying to do it because it is good for your body (although most people would benefit from eating less meat). The video makes the case that we should cut these products out because of the way other animals are being treated. 




  270lbs per person per year. That's half your body weight!

Lol 




 Let me introduce you to [Bob Comis](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4518133) a pig farmer who ran an idyllic farm under the best of conditions, but who acknowledged that there are still many forms of cruelty inherent to the system of raising animals for food. 




 [This article (from before the veto) does a better job of discussing the major issues](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/arizona-passes-a-bill-that-states-livestock-are-not-animals/). In short, the legislation said that livestock would no longer be considered animals as far as Arizona animal welfare laws were concerned, and it would have removed all protections that they had.  




 There was only one other woman eating by herself.

And now that lonely woman is going to be seen by thousands of people sitting alone in that restaurant. 




 [Insects are animals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect)

Kingdom |	Animalia
---|---
Phylum |	Arthropoda
Clade |	Pancrustacea
Subphylum |	Hexapoda
(unranked) |	Ectognatha
Class |	Insecta

However, there is also the aspect of whether they are animals that can meaningfully be exploited or harmed, as there are some animals such as sponges, that lack nervous systems and therefore there is little reason to suspect they can suffer. Insects do possess nervous systems, and most vegans feel there is sufficient reason to suspect insects can suffer to warrant not consuming them. 




 The taste is not bad. If I had to compare it to something I would say pancake batter, but it is more pleasant than drinking pancake batter.

 You do realize that in order to produce meat you need to feed animals more energy (calories) than you get back out when they are slaughtered, right? We are using huge amounts of arable land currently to feed livestock that could be used to feed more people if it was used to grow food intended directly for human consumption. 




 I think /u/unlimitednights is saying that it is not enough just to treat someone well, that still wouldn't make it okay to kill them. 




 People who don't pay attention to what they eat in general tend to end up unhealthy. There is nothing exceptionally complex about planning an appropriate vegan diet. 




 Cattle aren't going to go extinct if humans stop farming them. There are [wild cattle in the Aleutian Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleutian_wild_cattle) that humans have been trying to round up unsuccessfully for decades. 

Other than that your comment is spot on.

 It varies quite a bit from one veg fest to another. The worst event I have ever been to for pseudoscience nonsense was actually a green festival (I ran the Action For Animals table at the San Francisco and Los Angeles Green Festivals a couple years back). There were magnetic bracelets and "energy" jewelry galore. It was a really disappointing glimpse at the environmental movement that made you realize why some people would question the accuracy of the environmental claims these people were making.

They also printed our name badges on paper made from elephant poop. I feel like they should at least give a heads up before someone hangs some elephant feces around their neck.

 Isn't this something that most of us already are doing? 




 Take a look at [ChooseVeg.com](http://www.chooseveg.com/). It is the best resource I have found for answering questions about how to make the switch to a vegan lifestyle.

The simple answer though is to just do it! Everyone I have ever spoken to about going vegan has said that it was easier than they had imagined beforehand and that once they committed to doing it they didn't regret it for a moment. 




 How would you have written it better? 




 Dawkins has also said that he would like everyone to go vegetarian and that the future may look back on our present treatment of other animals the way we look back on our ancestors owning slaves.

 There still are chickens that roam freely in many places. Kauai has chickens that can be found all over the island. 

They are also much more intelligent than people give them credit for. Chickens can be taught to sit and come or even to complete an obstacle course. They form a social hierarchy called a pecking order and they will perform favors for other individuals showing that they clearly recognise one another and remember past actions.

 Don't patronize us as if we don't have any idea of what happens in the dairy industry. I have been to idyllic dairy farms. I have helped in the process of making cheese with milk from cows that I milked myself. I follow the posts of the [National Dairy Council](http://www.nationaldairycouncil.org/Pages/Home.aspx) and read articles from just about every dairy industry magazine that publishes their material online. Not only do we follow the dairy industry's own publications, but there are vegans who [are former large scale dairy farmers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Lyman).  

I don't just watch undercover investigations posted by animal rights groups. I watch [videos from dairy farmers of their own operations, like this video of farmers "reuniting" their cows with their calves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vSIlTNED-Q). I no longer just see a few happy cows though. I see several panicked mothers who are seeing their children again as well as many more who are still frantically searching for their lost sons. Mothers who may never fully recover from the trauma of losing their children. I read [this comment](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2zwd7f/what_goes_on_in_the_mind_of_a_cow/cpn3ixe) recently from someone else who, like yourself, grew up on a dairy farm, and described the efforts the mothers go through to protect their children. I see the hopeless sons crying for their mothers, but who will most likely face a short life before being slaughtered for veal. I see the slaughter the cows themselves will inevitably face as they age.

We don't make the decision to change our lifestyles lightly, but only after thoroughly researching and understanding both sides of the issue. When you have put half the effort into understanding our position that we have put into understanding yours, then we will be happy to welcome you for an AMA. 




 I'm not surprised. They are well connected to a lot of other vegans. 




 Several more states have passed ag-gag laws.  




 I often hear people dismiss the footage shown in undercover investigations as being simply isolated incidents. They claim the actions are the work of a handful of bad employees and not representative of the industry as a whole. Based on your experience, how prevalent would you say the mistreatment of animals is within the meat industry? 




 Supplements or fortified foods can be appropriate sources for B12 as a vegan, and you probably eat fortified foods all the time. You have iodized salt, breakfast cereal, and enriched flour. We are far better off than we would otherwise be because we consume fortified foods. 




 [Link for those who are interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce4DJh-L7Ys) 




 Congrats on your poops bro. 




 Very few people are vegan because they object to the taste/texture of meat. On the contrary most of us enjoyed meat, but found that we couldn't justify consuming it because of the harm caused to animals, the environment, or personal health. Having things that taste like meat without these negative consequences are a win-win! 




 I don't have any urgent desire to post audio or video; although I might consider using it if there were more people on the site. It just throws me off to have the links that don't do anything. 

Also, what is the point of private photos. Why would people upload a photo at all if nobody can see it? 




 I went through the trouble of setting up a profile, so I expect you guys to join and message me! 




 When I'm writing my profile can I do any formatting? Am I able to use asterisks, HTML, or CSS to **bold** text? Is there any way to add hyperlinks to my profile?

EDIT:

I also see that there are tabs for pictures, audio, and video on each profile, but I can't find anywhere to upload audio or video, nor does it seem to be possible to have more than one picture uploaded. 




 You get the best view of the underside of *his* belly between 2:21 and 2:25 into the video. There are no udders visible there. 




 Well when it does we will make sure to keep in mind that /u/NOBODYFUCKSWIFJESUS was the one that started it. 




 I very nearly decided to use "cow" in the title. I knew it wasn't correct, but I didn't care about conveying the gender of the individual featured in the video, and unfortunately there is no accepted singular form of the word "cattle". It really doesn't matter if the video is about a castrated or uncastrated (insert singular of cattle here) either. 




 Your post got downvoted by many other people than just vegans, but I wouldn't blame vegans for downvoting it too, as most people don't like baseless accusations directed at them. Try going to a thread discussing the keystone XL pipeline and accusing /r/environment of vote brigading without good evidence to back it up. You will get downvoted by members of /r/environment and nonmembers whose opinions you just dismissed as nothing more than part of a vote brigade! That is exactly how you came off in the comment you linked to, which was directed at someone that wasn't vegan. 




 I believe it is a health hazard, and also would probably have a very unpleasant taste as we have evolved to avoid animals who have died under such circumstances for food safety reasons. We similarly have an aversion to the sight and particularly smell of sick, dying, or dead animals. 




 I have been watching this thread closely too. There isn't some huge vegan force taking vegans to the top and downvoting meat based comments. There are plenty of comments with views on both sides that have been upvoted and downvoted, and while I'm sure there are plenty of redditors with some bias, for the most part the comments that have succeeded have been due to their merits and speaking to a wide audience. The views I have seen expressed in this thread seem to fall within the normal spectrum of views expressed on animal rights across reddit.

I know that /r/vegan made that stickied post in large part because there are inevitably a handful people like yourself who accuse vegans and specifically /r/vegan of vote brigading whenever comments supporting animal rights get upvoted. If you read the top comment from that /r/vegan post it is about how vegans need to hold themselves to a higher standard than the rest of the community in order to be accepted. /r/vegan wanted to make abundantly clear that it did not support any such actions and protect itself from potential backlash from the community or site admins. I know a lot of the members from /r/vegan and none of them support vote brigading, nor have I seen any pattern of problem vote brigading from /r/vegan in the past (any more than any other subreddit). 




 No, of course I don't mind people looking at my post history. I wouldn't post things if I didn't want people to see them. I hope you have a similarly enjoyable veganniversary! 




 That's a bit of an unfair assessment of my submissions. I submit [robots dancing](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/2zpply/robot_dance_party/) and [pictures I have taken at the beach](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2z8bin/i_did_some_digging_at_the_beach_this_weekend_the/). I submit [recipes](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/2v6xuq/pasta_with_snap_peas_garlic_lemon_zest_and_black/) and [quotes](http://www.reddit.com/r/quotes/comments/2zl7to/it_is_difficult_to_get_a_man_to_understand/). I also run a Scavenger Hunt every summer at /r/summerscavengerhunt (everyone should join, it is a lot of fun).

I am glad that many people who see the gifs of pigs and other animals that I submit are led to reconsider the ways in which they treat other animals as a result of seeing the gif; however, anyone who thinks it is possible to submit content and count solely on the voting power of vegans to buoy it is delusional. /u/macaroni_monster's comment has about 200 karma because it spoke to vegans and non-vegans alike. My submission is approaching 4500 karma because it is a submission that everyone appreciates (well, 96% of people according to the current votes). People who act crass and careless to the treatment of other animals are downvoted because they are out of touch with the way the majority of people feel about how we ought to treat other animals. 




  I have nothing in common with pigs.

You have plenty of things in common with pigs. You share 4 billion years of ancestors, you have a similar brain structure, digestive structure, circulatory system, etc. That said, why does an individual need to be similar to you in order to be deserving of ethical consideration? If there were aliens who were fully aware, possessed strong emotions and interests, and suffered when mistreated, would it be okay to mistreat them simply because they were not similar to you? 




 Even by the intelligence metric there are plenty of other animals that are smarter than many humans (for example young children, the severely mentally handicapped, or senile elderly individuals). We rightly insist that these humans still get treated far better than we currently treat other animals. Why don't we insist upon at least a similar level of treatment for non-human animals? 




 I'm a vegan teetotaler for non-religious reasons too! 




 True, but they have been pretty substantially diluted by that point. 




 Working to earn a large salary so that we can donate a substantial portion of it is an arguably more effective thing each of us can be doing. [Here is a piece by Animal Charity Evaluators that discusses this strategy](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/resources/career-advice/). 




 We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere.

-Elie Wiesel 




 There's more to determining what we ought to do than simply pointing to things that we enjoy or things that are convenient. You have to take into account the impact your actions have on others as well. 




 I believe news stories when the things they are saying matches what can be found in the original research the news stories are based off of. I'm entirely willing to change my views on the subject if there was good evidence to justify changing my views.  




 If plants did have feelings, far fewer plants would need to be killed if we ate them directly than if we fed plants to animals then subsequently ate those animals, so choosing a plant-based diet would still be a more ethical option. Although, I would argue that choosing a diet particularly heavy in fruit would then be the most ethical choice as plants have evolved to make fruits with the goal of having them be eaten to help spread their seeds. 

However, there is also good reason for us to believe that plants do not feel emotions in any meaningful sense. We know that in ourselves and other animals our experience of emotions exists in the reactions taking place in our nervous system. As plants do not possess nervous systems (and even some animals such as sponges) there is no reason to suspect such capabilities would extend to organisms lacking those systems. 

I have of course read plenty of sensational news stories about how "science proves that plants feel pain." However, all of these stories seem to be based off of much more reasonable research on how plants react to stimuli. A rock will similarly react to the stimuli of being kicked, and a light bulb will react to the stimuli of an electric current, but that does not mean they feel emotions.  




 As much as people hate to be confronted with criticism of their actions, there are some relevant comparisons to be made. Before people flip the fuck out about "how dare you compare killing animals to the Holocaust or slavery" [read this comic](http://imgur.com/a/BqPzT). I am not saying that they are the same in every regard, nor that they are equally unjust or even that you necessarily have to accept that the comparison tells us anything useful about how we ought to feel about them. I'm saying that in respect to the massive number of deaths or the treatment of individuals as property there is a relevant similarity that can under some circumstances be helpful for understanding both sets of issues. 

While non-human animals may not be deserving of all the ethical consideration of the typical adult human, many of the animals we eat, particularly pigs, are quite intelligent (in many regards more intelligent than young human children). There are many humans (for example the severely mentally handicapped) who will never progress past the intellectual capabilities of a young child, and there is no reason to suspect that they have any more capacity to experience joy or suffering any more intensely than a pig. Nonetheless, we all recognize that it would be a grave injustice to treat these people as we presently treat pigs or other farmed animals. Why should we be any less upset about the terrible treatment of pigs than we would rightly be about similar treatment of severely mentally handicapped individuals? 




 That's why I added the qualifier "significant amounts of" to my statement. The dairy industry breeds cows to have a calf every year to maximize the total yield, but I understand that cows would still produce some milk for quite some time after having their first calf as long as they continue to be pumped. 




  Eating meat is natural and doesn't kill the consumer.

OP isn't worried about smokers killing themselves; they are worried about them causing harm to other individuals. Eating meat certainly harms other animals, and it causes a lot more harm than second hand smoke. 




 In the last 100 years we have started doing many things that differ from how humans have evolved. Even in terms of food you are purchasing fruits, vegetables, and countless other varieties of foods that didn't exist a century ago. You are typing away on technology that didn't exist and people are extending their lives with medical treatments that didn't exist. In terms of ethics we are treating women, gays, people of other races, and the disabled differently from how our ancestors would have. Why would you continue to cling to the circumstances under which humans evolved in this one particular area when we have successfully progressed in so many other areas? 




  Again, what about things that aren't sentient that vegans won't eat? Barnacles, mussels, clams, oysters? You blatantly tried to divert the topic.

[Vegans are okay with eating those](http://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) 




 I happen to think I can do a better job of evaluating the ethics of my actions than the typical lion, which is why I don't look to lions for my ethics (not to mention I have far better alternatives available to me than a lion does). 




 In that case I'm sure this will assuage your concerns:

 Our current treatment of other animals will certainly be seen as barbaric in the future. We are learning more and more that many other animals possess sophisticated inner lives, that they are capable of using tools, learning from and teaching one another, and complex communication. Intelligent animals like pigs undoubtedly experience intense suffering, boredom, and pain as a result of their treatment on contemporary farms.

Just as the past couple centuries has seen our circle of compassion extending to include far greater rights for women and people of differing races, the future will hold greater consideration for the suffering of other species as well. 




 The food chain shouldn't have anything to do with what we choose to eat. You will not become prey to any other animals if you start eating more plant foods. 




 First of all, humans are not at the top of the food chain. Animals at the top of the food chain would be ones that eat other predatory animals exclusively. Humans eat plant foods and some herbivorous animals, placing us far lower on the food chain.

If your concern is over the fact that you don't want to be eaten by other predatory animals, clearly the risk of this will not change simply because humans choose to eat more plant-based foods.

The "food chain" should not be the source we use to determine how to live ethically. 




 There are also parents who feed their babies non-vegan diets and kill them from malnutrition. Babies should be breast fed or fed infant formula. Parents who fail to do that are just irresponsible parents and it has no reflection on the healthfulness of appropriate vegan or non-vegan diets. 




 Do you think dairy farms actually keep cows around until they die of old age? Cows' milk production drops off as they age. Every dairy farm sends cows to slaughter.

[From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle):

Domestic cows can live to 20 years, however those raised for dairy rarely live that long, as the average cow is removed from the dairy herd around age four and marketed for beef.

On top of this cows, like all mammals, only produce significant amounts of milk for a period after they have had a calf (they are inseminated on dairy farms to have about one calf per year according to Wikipedia). The male calves are of no use to the dairy industry, and are typically slaughtered for veal. So the slaughter of cattle is also supported in that sense by dairy consumption.

 Does it happen more frequently with vegans than non-vegans? In the unfortunate cases where it does happen is it actually attributable to the diet being vegan or is it due to some other factor?

Those are questions that the organizations I cited look into before publishing their statements. I'm willing to bet that whatever sensationalist news story you read did not look into those questions.

The scientific consensus behind the position that appropriately planned vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life is overwhelming. 




 Every major dietetic association in the world agrees that appropriately planned vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life, and they nearly all encourage breast feeding of infants.

 I expect Action For Animals to have the tour schedule worked out within the next 2-3 weeks, so they will let you know by then. 




 We had someone bail while I was on tour in 2013 and it messed things up for us quite a bit. 

Can you let me know what shows you might be able to do? I'll check once a schedule has been put together and see if we are still shorthanded for any of those shows. 




 Send a follow up e-mail to your original e-mail letting Action For Animals know that you are interested now. They are trying to work out a schedule for all the shows and that would be good for them to know as they are planning. 




 No. Action For Animals has wristbands that will get volunteers into the shows. When you get to the show you will give one of the volunteers who is travelling with the Tour a call and we will come out and find you to let you in.

 Congrats, that's an awesome position! 




 [Unfortunately, the district attorney has already decided not to press any charges](http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/no-charges-for-colorado-farmworkers-videotaped-hitting-pigs/).

If what was revealed in this video wasn't criminal then the laws need to be fixed. 




 [ChooseVeg.com](http://www.chooseveg.com/) is a great resource for people looking to include less meat in their diets.

Reddit also has awesome communities at /r/vegetarian, /r/vegan, /r/vegrecipes, and /r/veganrecipes! 




 If companies can get away with treating animals terribly and allowing their workers to outright abuse animals while still selling their product and making a profit then they will continue to do so. Corporations care about what consumers are buying. 




 But instead of doing that, factory farmers are pushing for [ag-gag laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ag-gag) all across the country so they can continue to treat animals terribly while not having to worry about their terrible treatment of animals being exposed to the public. 




 Reddit was also outraged when some tourists lit a quokka on fire in New Zealand, but then we got even more outraged when commenters asked why we were outraged about the quokka while remaining apathetic about all the other animals that are commonly treated poorly. 




 lol, I would have taken it as a joke, but unfortunately far too many people say those things seriously. 




 I certainly appreciated meat. I ate a lot of meat growing up and enjoyed the taste as much as anyone.

Unfortunately, just because something is natural doesn't mean that it is ethical. For example, humans have waged war for millennia. We even see tribal clashes between different groups of great apes. Could anything be more natural? Yet I think we can both recognize that despite being natural we both would condemn unnecessary warfare.

To determine if something is ethical we must look at both the benefits (such as my enjoyment of meat), and the negatives (the harm caused to other animals). As much as I enjoyed the taste of meat, there was little doubt that the harm caused to other animals outweighed these benefits in almost all cases. (One exception might be a food like oysters. While they are technically animals they possess a very minimal nervous system.) 




 Also, /u/YawnY86's long comment said nothing about what is best for the cows. It was simply how their farm maximizes profit at auction. It is incredibly telling how many people in the industry lose the ability to differentiate between what cows might appreciate and what maximizes a farmer's profits. 




 If meat could be produced without any harm to animals I would have no ethical objections to consuming it and would likely eat it on occasion. 




 [Like this](http://store.afa-online.org/product.php?productid=17410 cat=0 page=1)?

Action For Animals has a couple other colors as well if you look through their store. All the money you spend there goes to supporting Action For Animals' activism! 




 Vegans are actually largely supporting and even funding the push for synthetic meat. [Here is an essay from Ingrid Newkirk](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/20/magazine/ethics-eating-meat.html?_r=0) (president of PETA. ^I ^know ^they ^suck ) about how she is excited to eat meat for the first time in 40 years once it can be synthesized.

As much as reddit likes to circlejerk about vegans needing to feel special that really isn't why people choose to be vegan.

[Here is a quote from the animal rights group Vegan Outreach](http://www.veganoutreach.org/advocacy/path.html):

We want a vegan world, not a vegan club. 




 You should share your tofu recipe in the /r/vegan thread for simple vegan recipes. 




 Hey, it's that woman who abuses her chickens by letting them eat their own eggs!
 




 Recipe for /u/test_subject7471's steamed vegetables:

1. Purchase cook-in-bag frozen vegetables.
2. Insert in microwave for amount of time indicated on bag.
 




 I read the comment /u/PumpkinMomma is referring to. I would have found that pretty insulting.  




 Did you look at the other comments about what a great prank this is? People clearly understand that this is a prank and not the most effective way to advocate for animal rights.

We can enjoy humor on this subreddit too. 




 We had a thread from an omni a couple weeks ago saying what a friendly and welcoming community they thought /r/vegan is. I have to say that I have found this community to live up to that reputation as well, and the only hatemongering I see is in posts that try to condemn us all with a single brush.

I do find your second paragraph to be quite telling however. Eating animal products is not merely a personal choice as it does not simply impact oneself. It causes harm to the animals being slaughtered and consumed as well. Vegans view this treatment of animals as being unethical. If you view every comment on the vegan subreddit that says "using animals in this way is wrong" as being hatemongering then it is hardly a surprise that you reach the conclusion that this subreddit is hateful.  




 It is produced by bacteria. It is vegan. 




 I want my own brussel-sprout-hatred ever after story. 




 I ate a vegetable once and I almost puked. How can vegans compare this to REAL foods like chicken nuggets?

Finally, I guarantee that you know some of [these famous vegans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vegans) who look quite healthy. 




 There isn't going to be any product on the market that tastes exactly identical to meat, but there certainly are products that are indistinguishable in certain settings. I have seen taste tests with vegan sausages and vegan ground meat where people were fed these alternatives and conventional meats and they were unable to identify which was which.

People's perception of these products also plays a strong role in how they will claim the products taste. I have seen research on protein bars where they fed people the bar with a wrapper that either said, "contains 9 grams of protein" or "contains 9 grams of soy protein". Despite the bars being identical, the people who received the "soy protein" wrapper rated the product as tasting much worse, but they perceived it as being healthier. 

There isn't anything on the market today that will replicate a 12 oz  chunk of steak, but there are indistinguishable alternatives for many of the settings in which people eat meat today, as long as you go into it without prejudiced expectations based upon knowing the product is vegan. In addition to this for the meats that are not yet being replicated, many of the vegan alternatives on the market are still delicious in their own right and can be a new food that many people would enjoy having added into their diet.

Finally, tastes vary from person to person, so the only way to really discover which foods you like best are to try them out for yourself. 




 [ChooseVeg.com](http://www.chooseveg.com/) is a great resource for people looking to add more plant-based foods to their diet. 




 [My favorite picture from that site](https://nakedvegancooking.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/cranachan.jpg) 




 You're not at the top of the food chain. An animal that exclusively eats other carnivorous animals, would be at the top of the food chain. That said, the food chain isn't something that tells us how we ought to behave either, it is merely a description of the current state of nature (you cannot derive an ought from an is). 

Clearly you don't need to worry about becoming prey for another animal just because you have chosen to eat more plant-based foods. Your position in that sense is safe. 




 [The actor in that scene went vegan after filming the movie](http://www.humanesociety.org/news/magazines/2015/01-02/unprejudiced-heart-interview-with-babe-actor-james-cromwell.html):

It also inspired me to become vegan. After having worked all morning with these extraordinary animals, I'd see their relatives on the lunch table. They had ham and duck, every animal except horse. That's when I said, "I've got to try to be a vegan." And for the most part, I have been vegan since 1994. 




 Choosing to become vegetarian or vegan isn't going to solve all of the world's problems or even all of the problems with how animals are treated today, but it is something simple that each and every one of us can do that will make a world of difference for those animals who will be spared a life of unimaginable misery thanks to our choices. Reddit has excellent communities at /r/vegetarian, /r/vegan, /r/VegRecipes, and /r/veganrecipes for anyone who is interested in adding more plant-based foods into their diet. I'm thrilled to see redditors caring more and more about how our choices in what we eat impact other animals. 




 If demand declines cows won't be starved. As demand declines fewer cows will be bred to meet the lower demand. 




 While I am not pictured in the photograph, I am comfortable with you thinking that I am any of the four individuals in this image. 




 Well there is a difference in that sea world keeps tens of animals in captivity, while tens of billions of animals are kept on factory farms (and then slaughtered). I would say that is a difference of roughly a factor of a billion.

 What differentiates things like hunting for sport that people do presumably because they enjoy it from people who are only eating meat because they enjoy the taste of it?

 1. It isn't true.

 Commercial free-range egg production isn't much better. Producers still compete with one another to cut costs at the expense of the animals' well being.

[Here is a picture of a free-range egg laying operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-range_eggs#/media/File:Free-range-hens.jpg) 




 You can promote a vegan product to omnivores without encouraging them to consume more non-vegan products at the same time. I have [successfully shared several vegan recipes on non-vegan subreddits](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/search?q=test_subject7471 restrict_sr=on sort=relevance t=all) without having to compromise on my values. The harm they are causing by encouraging people to use chicken breasts almost certainly outweighs the good of getting a few more people to try Daiya.  




 How did you come across the movie Fowl Play?

[Here is a link to Fowl Play on YouTube -[50:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiOR6XTXzsE) for anyone else who is interested. 




 The school cafeteria is going to point you to a food service company. If you're lucky they will tell you a packaging/manufacturing or some other wholesaler that they get a specific product from. That company may source product from one or dozens of places that refine ingredients, which they are unlikely to divulge. Finally the ingredient refiners probably source from hundreds of farms. 

It is going to be very difficult to trace the chain back all the way to a farm.

 I agree. Bullfighting is still incredibly cruel, but too many people glaze over the fact that the way animals are treated on today's farms is even worse. 




 I'm sure there will be a post soon about how vegans need to stop hatefully shoving our views about cutting on the bias down the throats of lacto-ovo vegetarians (since obviously /r/vegetarian is only for lacto-ovos). Then we will have to keep all posts that mention cutting on the bias on /r/vegan too. 




 [You wanna fight? I'll take you down so hard!](http://i.imgur.com/kHRKOcu.gifv) 




 What about their sensitive vegetarian feelings when they see how much better we look than they do? 




 I was really reluctant to become vegan even after I found out more about how terribly animals are treated for dairy and egg production (and slaughtered all the same). I tried signing up on the Vegan Freak forums though since I really liked their podcast, but I told them that going vegan was too hard for me. They were a bunch of meanies and told me that my excuses sucked and that their forums were a safe place for vegans only.

I decided to give veganism a shot since I wanted to be a part of the forums, and 7 years later I couldn't be more happy that I did! 




 Are you saying we need to start posting more nudes to /r/vegetarian? I suppose I could help out. 




 I usually recommend [ChooseVeg.com](http://www.chooseveg.com/) to omnis who might be interested in adopting a diet with fewer animal products. It is run by Mercy For Animals and everything they promote is entirely vegan. 




 Don't worry, on /r/vegan we have lots of talk about our awesome vegan poops. 




 I'm not sure if your comment is sarcastic or not. Clearly there are still issues with things like factory farming that nobody should support whether they are omni, lacto-ovo, or vegan. 




 Woah, if you are trying to disagree with something that a lacto-ovo vegetarian says you can only do that over at /r/vegan! 




 I'm not sure how I feel about getting multiplied by carnistscum. 




 Seriously, if she wants to not eat dairy and eggs that is her personal choice, but it is my right to consume these products that don't harm anyone. It's not like anyone is going to cry if I choose to drink milk, and it's not like anyone gets ground up alive so that I can eat eggs. 

If you vegans want to disagree with me on that point then you can only say that over at /r/vegan where nobody here will have to listen to you. 




 Oh come on, I have contributed enough to this subreddit to earn my place on the list of people you don't like. 




 Why don't you do your thing over at /r/meatfreediet? If people want to only hear about what you like then they'll join you over there.

/r/vegetarian is a place for discussing all types of vegetarian diets and that includes vegan ones. 




 You keep acting like vegans aren't also vegetarians. The purpose of /r/vegetarian is to promote vegetarian lifestyles and that includes vegan ones. 




 People need to be careful about what they say or they could make someone cry like a baby calf that has been separated from his mother.  




 The purpose of /r/vegetarian is whatever vegetarians are interested in. That is a wide variety of topics, some of which also includes harm caused to animals by production of some vegetarian foods. If something is upvoted that tends to be a pretty good sign that vegetarians find it relevant to the subreddit. We don't need additional censorship from the mods. 




 But I have to be careful to only consider the feelings of the people on /r/literallyhitler, and not the ~~jews~~ chickens that are being gassed, right? 




 You aren't the one suffering. The animals are the ones being oppressed. Vegans aren't oppressing vegetarians by discussing issues pertaining to the treatment of other animals on this subreddit. 

People who care about how animals are treated, which I would argue is the majority of this subreddit, want to see discussions on the topic, even if it goes beyond simply how eating the flesh of animals is bad for animals. 




 It was my thread that they are accusing of vegetarian-shaming! 




 60% of my redditing is done from my throne of moral superiority. 




 I happen to be reading Nick Cooney's new book on the subject right now. 

[How To Be Great At Doing Good by Nick Cooney on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Great-Doing-Good-ebook/dp/B00SZ6378S/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8 sr= qid=) 




 One cruel step in an incredibly cruel system. 




 The cage free picture is from [this Sierra Club article](http://www.sierraclub.org/chicago/sierra/2015-2-march-april/feature/local-roots-vs-industrial-agriculture#8)

The Free Range picture is from [the Wikipedia article on free range eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-range_eggs)

The organic picture is from [this CBS news article](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trouble-in-the-henhouse-the-scam-of-organic-eggs/) 




 Here's the thing that people frequently miss when judging the environmental impact of local products versus far away products. If you buy steak or any other product from 5,000 miles away they aren't putting that one steak in a car and having someone drive it 5,000 miles. They are loading 10,000 lbs of product onto a truck/airplane and shipping all of that. If you bought 1lb of steak your portion of that is equivalent to roughly half a mile of transport. If you drove an extra 5 miles to find a place that sells locally sourced meat that is going to be roughly 10 times as harmful as buying the meat from across the country if you as an individual drive a shorter distance to pick it up.

Then again, none of this actually looks at how the animals are treated.  The places where lots of people live aren't able to produce lots of products that rely upon vast open land area to be produced. To meet a city's increasing demand for local products it is only possible if it becomes increasingly intensive and increasingly confined. 




 [Here are pictures of cage-free, free-range, and organic egg laying operations](http://imgur.com/a/fp7C0). They are also all local to somewhere. 




 Yeah dawg 




 If I've learned one thing about nutrition from vegans it is eat a lot of just one thing. Too much variety is never healthy in your diet. 




 They're all sleeping right now. Probably dreaming about eating vegan fish and chips. 




 Why would things only matter if they exist indefinitely? If it doesn't matter that you have had a positive impact for 100 years or 100 million years into the future, why would longer or indefinite periods of time make your impact matter? 




 I'm not impossible. I'm right here. 




 Did Dave talk to you a bunch about getting snipped while you were on tour with him? 




 The same thing that happened to all the people who were working in VCR factories, retailers, and repair shops when people stopped buying VCRs. They will find new jobs. Most likely ones that utilize similar skill sets. 




 Check out [VeganBodyBuilding.com](http://veganbodybuilding.com/) 




 Won the lottery and one step closer to getting your shiny vegan badge! 




 Plant foods are great sources of B-vitamins with the exception of vitamin B12.

Vitamin B12 isn't costly to get anywhere. It is produced by bacteria, and can only be reliably obtained from animal based foods, fortified foods, or a supplement. 




 A multivitamin costs less than $0.10 per day. Tons of foods like cereals and soy milks are fortified as well. 




 You haven't made a case for why either one of those things is okay. Killing animals for either of those reasons probably is not acceptable. 




 I have heard that vegan foods are so low in nutrients that vegans need to eat a mountain of food every day just to be able to survive. 




 The real key is the fiber. Studies have found that 99% of omnis suffer from pernicious fiber deficiency, and this can lead to digestive duress, bad stories for their poop blogs, and even death. This looks like a healthy (and delicious) high fiber meal. 




 /u/BlizeH. I also got an additional 1 quid (also from BlizeH) since I made the above comment. 




 I was hoping to see this as a gif 




 So far I have earned $1 and 6 months of reddit gold from my activism. Well on my way to retirement! 




 This is a gif that I submitted to /r/aww and /r/gifs today. There are a lot of good comments on the /r/gifs submission. 




 It is a loving cow. 




 A big part of getting the price down is having the capital to begin mass producing product and begin getting product out to lots of stores/people very efficiently. The large investment is a good sign that this product could be at a very competitive price. 




 Any other pangolins out there?

 I hope to see this on the front page tomorrow. 




 Use the .gifv file format. Actual .gif files take forever to load. Also that is a really good gif. 




 How do you know that someone thinks they could never be vegan?

Don't worry, they'll tell you. 




 That /u/infinity guy is really popular. I wish I got as many username mentions as he does.

(My username starts with a lowercase L) 




 Oh no! I don't want to kill anything!  :P 




 There are a couple people who keep accusing my gifs of being a secret vegan plot to control reddit (or something like that). 

I'm not trying to be secretive about what I'm doing. I'm vegan and I'm thrilled when more people choose to cut back on animal products, especially when it is because of one of my posts. All I'm doing though is sharing content that I appreciate and that I think other redditors will appreciate too. There's nothing secretive or sinister about that. 




 Yeah, I do a good amount of leafleting and tabling. I donate to Animal Charity Evaluators' recommended charities. I started an animal rights club back in college. I have toured as a volunteer with Action For Animals at the Warped Tour for the past couple years and I'm planning to do it for a little over a week again this summer.

That sounds like a lot, but I really still am a normal guy most of the time. I could/should be doing much more. 




 I wonder how /u/infinity feels about getting all these username mentions. 




 Really?  In the "What is philosophy?" guidelines to posting it mentions, "Value Theory, which includes ethics/moral philosophy, political philosophy, aesthetics, and similar areas."

I can't see how this would not fall under that umbrella. 




 Record it on video and upload it to YouTube so that we can show even more omnis! 




 [Here it is](http://i.imgur.com/99X3uRh.gifv) 




 [This is my favorite gif of pigs eating](http://i.imgur.com/IovOTlX.gifv) 




 Pigs are such incredible animals... [Look at this one doing a puzzle!](http://i.imgur.com/O6h0DPM.gifv) 




 This is my favorite comment. :) 




 There are other gay vegan dudes in the South right now thinking to themselves how much they would like to find someone who's vegan. 




  Maccas

Found the Australian! 




 I know that they raised a lot of money that they put toward improving their ability to distribute Soylent efficiently. I'm not sure if they have fixed all of the issues with the long wait times to distribute product yet, but I expect it to either be resolved by now or it will be soon. 




 It is difficult to really show if someone else feels pain. Fish respond to painkillers in ways that seem to suggest that pain is being relieved. [Here is a site which refers to some good studies about that](http://www.fishpain.com/fish-and-pain-analgesic.htm).

Also, this doesn't specifically deal with pain, but [Wikipedia has a good article on Fish Intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_intelligence). 




 You should be upset. What they are doing is absolutely not okay. I'm sure their condesention and dismissive attitude is beyond frustrating as well. Don't try to get rid of that passion that you feel.

Keep in mind though that you aren't the one suffering. When reacting to your parents or anyone else think of what will be best for helping the animals, not what will feel most satisfying for you. Sometimes that might mean showing your frustration or telling someone off, but more often that means remaining cool and rational, acting like you understand where people are coming from, and presenting the animals' case in the most levelheaded way you can. 




 This is a case that will go down in history. When the future looks back at the abysmal treatment of most animals today they will point to this case as setting important precedent for securing non-human animals better protection under the law. 




 Thank you. 

First of all I want to thank my mom and dad for always being there for me. Gotta thank the big man upstairs. And of course all those fans out there who upvoted me. I couldn't have done it without you guys. 




 Pig farmer Bob Comis who holds himself to the highest standards of animal welfare writes, "I cannot think of one sound ethical argument in favor of slaughtering animals for their meat." After years getting to know the personalities of the animals he raises, he questions whether it is right for him to go on in the industry. 




 If I had to compare the taste to something I would say it tastes something like pancake batter, but I think it is more enjoyable than drinking straight pancake batter would be. It definitely works for keeping me full and keeping my energy levels up. 




 I have given up on dating omnis. We don't share enough in common and it is much too emotionally draining to see someone you care about regularly acting in ways that you find to be unethical. I am content with being single until I can find a worthwhile vegan girlfriend. 




 There are tons of cosmetics available that aren't tested on animals and do not contain animal products. That said, what someone's mom does should have no impact on that person's ability to speak up about what is right and wrong. 




 I remember hearing something from them about raising a lot of capital to improve their ability to distribute their product more efficiently (it took almost 4 months for me to receive my order). I wouldn't be surprised to see them making international shipping available soon. 




 I can't wait to hear why people shouldn't be able to protest animal abuse if their moms wear makeup... 




 I have been using it for the past month or so. The taste is unobjectionable and it is incredibly convenient. I don't use it at normal meals, but if I don't feel like making anything or if I'm putting off a trip to the supermarket it is great to have around. I'm sure it would be great to take along while backpacking or travelling too. 




 They don't do any of those things. 




 They do not. 




 Have you considered just getting some [soylent](http://www.soylent.me/) to bring with you to places where you may not have many food options? 




 This gives me an idea of something to try. Sharing videos with people that have vegan videos in the related videos or as the "Up Next" video in the sidebar. 




 The average person also doesn't live to 80 years old without scientific interventions. You benefit every day from iodized salt, fortified breakfast cereals, enriched flour, and countless other fortified foods. We should embrace the better choices we can continue to make in the future thanks to today's technological advances.

 Let me quote /u/paleolitech:

Vegans abuse less plants you idiot, the inefficiency of animals (80% at best, 5% at worst) means you will indirectly kill 20% to 95% more plants in your lifetime than the average vegan.

And before you insult me or accuse me of "Lol PETA asshole", I mod /r/anti_vegan, so you know you're an idiot when even somebody critical of veganism calls you out on your BULLSHIT.

And HOOOOOLY FUCK, it's funny how you people are outraged somebody lit a little animal on fire then instantly reduce said animal to the non-conciousness of plants in seconds, all to make yourselves feel better.

Fucking idiotic.

Oh really? Let me hear how you easily refute the utilitarian reason for not harming other animals.

  A system of moral principles are views of right and wrong ~~enforce by a society~~. Since not eating meat is not enforced nor viewed as bad by society, it is by definition ethical.

Using that first definition your conclusion does not follow. 

The dictionary's example works that the ethics of a culture are a system of moral principles of a culture. That doesn't mean that the word can only refer to the moral principles of a culture or society. It refers, as the definition states, to a system of moral principles.

Your argument is being mocked on /r/badphilosophy. I don't think you can claim that vegans are the only ones who find holes in your reasoning.

 




 No, you were not using definition #1. Definition #1 does not limit the system of moral principles to only those held by society as a whole. Your argument relied upon that point. 




 [Dictionary.com definitions of "ethics"](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ethics?s=t)

1. (used with a singular or plural verb) a system of moral principles:
*the ethics of a culture.*


2. the rules of conduct recognized in respect to a particular class of human actions or a particular group, culture, etc.:
*medical ethics; Christian ethics.*

3. moral principles, as of an individual:
*His ethics forbade betrayal of a confidence.*

4. (usually used with a singular verb) that branch of philosophy dealing with values relating to human conduct, with respect to the rightness and wrongness of certain actions and to the goodness and badness of the motives and ends of such actions.

You seem to have used definition 2 as if it was the only definition. When clearly definition 1 fits far better for how the term is frequently used and used in the context to which you are attempting to respond. And definition 3 states that ethics and morals can be used interchangeably contrary to your entire argument.

 PETA is certainly a group with significant shortcomings, and people should donate to other animal rights groups ([Here are charities that Animal Charity Evaluators has recommended as the most effective for helping animals](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/)); however, PETA does not kill 95% of animals in their van, and there is a good reason why they have a high euthanasia rate (they offer humane euthanasia options to a community that cannot afford it otherwise).

 It is only vitamin B-12 that vegetarians and vegans need to look out for. They tend to get plenty of the other B vitamins. 

Products like soy milks and meat alternatives that are designed with vegetarian and vegan consumers in mind are frequently fortified with vitamin B12 accordingly, as are many other common foods like breakfast cereals. As an added precaution a supplement is also encouraged to protect against B12 deficiency.

  given the sheer number of leaflets that have been distributed, we should expect significantly more vegetarians and vegans than there actually are.

Have you tried doing the math on this? Vegan Outreach has distributed roughly 20,000,000 booklets. If we assume that 1% of people who receive a booklet go vegetarian that would be 200,000 vegetarians. Far fewer than the total number of vegetarians in the United States.

 You are awesome. 




 Relative to the RDA, oats are higher in protein than carbs or fat. 




 I would still try to make choices that cause as little pain as possible. 




 Right now you are benefiting from eating countless fortified foods. Iodine deficiency has plummeted since the advent of iodized salt. You eat enriched flour and breakfast cereals fortified with dozens of vitamins and minerals. You can't recreate these things without relying on the store.

Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis.
 




 Those are factual statements. I'm not following how you get from there to how we ought to behave.

I can say. "Humans have waged war for millennia. Violence is natural." However, I still condemn unnecessary violence. Wouldn't you? 




 I happen to think I am more capable of making informed ethical decisions, but if you think other animals are smarter than you are then I can see why you would look to them to guide your ethics. 




 So is it because something has happened for a long time that you think makes it okay, or are you trying to suggest that humans have evolved eating meat therefore it cannot be healthy to not eat meat? Could you flesh out this position a bit more? 




 Vegan Outreach shared it on Facebook. 




 I see that there is another party called "Shooters and Fishers" that won two seats. [This appears to be a political party centered around protecting people's "right" to hunt and fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooters_and_Fishers_Party).  

*sigh* 




 I want my beliefs to be able to stand up to all accurate information. If there is information that would challenge my beliefs then it is my beliefs that should change, not the information that should be silenced. 




 If you lived in a violent and bloody society you wouldn't just be the one committing the violence. You would also live in fear of or perhaps be the victim of violence against yourself.

This isn't just hypothetical either. Humans have waged war and participated in tribal violence for millennia. We even see other great apes occasionally engaging in territorial skirmishes with neighboring groups. What could possibly be more natural? 

Yet when you look at a terrible and bloody war taking place right now you would never simply say, "oh, it is just natural so that makes it okay." None of us really believe that nature should be the arbiter of our ethics.
