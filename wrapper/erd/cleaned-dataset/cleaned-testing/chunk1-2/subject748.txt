 See, this is why I love the Yogfamily! We aren't just fans, or content creators, but a form of support for each other! Trogon, I am so, so, so happy you're doing better, and know that in Texas, you have a fellow fan who supports your decision and wishes you the best as you become the beautiful young man or woman I know you are! 
Hugs all around! 




 Hey dude 




 Can't you merge the two? The Yogscast tell stories through their series, I think if we didn't at least have a coherent reason as two why the Yogs are fighting, it wouldn't quite have that Yogscast spirit. And an arcade mode wouldn't be bad either, that way it can be something other then story mode or multiplayer.  




 What if it was like all the Yogscast villians form an alliance to take over the world? They consist of Lanable, Israphel, a Pirate Captain, the two yoglabs scientists, Bort, Creeper and Zombie boss, the Flux Demon and a partly evil Parv  The Yogs get effected by Strawfinger's flux magic and they fight amoungst themselves. The player can make they're own character and help bring order to the 'server' and lead the final battle to Israphel, who takes over Yoglabs. Hatflims teams up with Flux Buddies and Strife Solutions to fire nukes at Yoglabs, allowing the Yogs and the 'Naut' as the player character is called, to infiltrate and defeat the villains. In the final boss battle, 'Naut' is given all the powers of the Yogscast to take out Israphel in a beam of 'Jaffa cakes, owls, rainbows, torches, shit, dirt and a red matter explosive', saving the day. Peace is restored to the server and Yoglabs is rebuilt, this time with cells for bad guys.    




 No you didn't. 




 I didn't want to join the Legion. I wasn't legion material according to Lupa. 




 But Zoey, I thought you were a Time Lady, and Fiona was your companion 




 "You want hope?!" I shouted up at the gods on their seats of power. Zeus, on his platinum throne, scowled at me, but a gentle nudging from Odin beside him made him sit up straighter. The one eyed god, resembling Brian Blessed, gave me a fatherly smile and nodded encouragingly. 
"I don't see what gives you, as gods, the right to destroy humanity! You, of all the beings in reality, should not exist! You have toyed with humans, manipulated them and slept with them. Civilizations have risen and fallen due to you lot, and you know what I say to that?" I shouted, turning in a full circle at the pantheon surrounding me, like an arena. I caught the glimpses of gods from the story books my mom read to me as a kid.  The Jackal headed Anubis was gnawing on a grotty bone and casting glances at gods around him and growling. The amazingly hot Aphrodite was curling her hair into little ringlets. She paused to look down at me and blow a kiss in my direction. Thor was putting Hemsworth to shame, his Viking armor straining to contain his muscles. Loki was looking down at me, his thin face scared with snake venom and age. His immortality wasn't doing him any favors. His sad eyes, webbed with cataracts, told me everything, just like what the Oracle had said. The eyes would decide everything.
"I think before you point fingers at humanity, you look at yourselves!" I shouted. Zeus's face twisted into a snarl. 
"Foolish boy! You dare compare us to your kind?!" He rose up from his throne, the air smelling of ozone. 
"I should fry you where you stand!" He howled. I felt like bolting, but stood my ground. 
"Go ahead sparky. Because to me, your not the god of lighting. Your just an angry guy with superpowers." Zeus howled and pointed a finger at me firing a bolt of lighting. The gods in the audience screamed in horror, but I closed by eyes and focused on the bolt. I heard a sizzle and opened my eyes. A circle of ash surrounded me, but I was unharmed. 
"By Cronos...." Zeus gasped, a look of pure shock on his face.  I smirked. "You see, gods and humans are symbiotic in nature. I don't believe that Zeus's power over lighting is real. So it isn't. Well, it was, but I believed that it didn't effect me." I adjusted my Roman toga and tried to ignore my shaking knees. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Athena wink at me knowingly. That gave me the courage to finish.
"So, considering that I just kicked Zeus in the butt and lived to tell about it. And I just confirmed that you need my kind to stay on this side of reality. So, who votes for keeping humanity around?"
-------------
"You performed well Chris Topher." Athena said, placing a hand on my shoulder. I was back outside my English class, at my university. I was back in my old clothes and I've never been happier to be wearing sweatpants and a 'Yogscast' t-shirt. Time was still stopped as before, everything frozen in place.  I turned to face the goddess, who was wearing her ceremonial armor. Her long dirty blonde hair cascaded down her back and shoulders like a caramel waterfall. Her face was beautiful in a strangely down to earth way, like underneath the armor and power, she was a normal woman.  
"Thank you my-" I began, but Athena shook her head and smiled. "No brave one, I come to thank YOU. You restored hope that humanity is worth saving. You showed us that humans are stronger than even the king of the gods. And I have this-" A leather corded necklace appeared in her hand. In the center was a small silver bead in the shape of an owl. "For my new champion." I took it and held it in my hand. "My lady- I mean Athena, are you-" She put her fingers to my lips and 'shushed' me. 
"Be silent, my brave one." Before time started up again, she thrust something into my hand before vanishing. I opened my fist to find a slip of paper, on witch was written, 'Project Argonauts 2'

---------------------
Hermes grinned when he saw Athena return. 
"Well, how did it go?" he asked, with the excitement of a school boy at Christmas. "It went well." Athena said, ignoring the messenger god. But Hermes wasn't there. He was already running off on his way around Olympus like a flash. Athena entered her private quarters and gazed at herself in the mirror. Then she paused. She swore she saw something out of the corner of her eye- Something hard slammed into the back of her head, throwing her face first into the marble mirror stand. Through the haze of pain and blood clouding her face, she saw a man with cloudy, milky eyes and scars across his face, standing over her with a bloodstained vase. 
"Excuse me sweetheart, I'm going to need your identity for a while, alright?" he said, as his face and clothes morphed into an exact copy of hers. 
"Well, look that that, I've got my own duds!" he crowed, before shattering the vase against the floor and picking up and shard. The Fake Athena grabbed Athena's hair and pulled back sharply, exposing her neck.  
"Now, let's get rid of some evidence!"

  
     
 




 You've never heard of the Wolf House? 




 Hey. (I pull up my flight goggles and look around at the camp) It's much better than the Wolf House.  




 Age: 17
Birthday: January 18th
Height: 5' 11"
Powers:
Flight
wind control to a degree
weather mainipulation
The general gist of Kyle:Raised by Lupa after his mother gave him up. Shy, geeky, but can kick butt if he needs to. He wears baggy pants, a jacket and a satchel with his gear in it.
Weapons: A crossbow as a last resort weapon. For hand to hand, he uses a knife but his favorite 'weapon' is a miniature drone equipped with some gadgets.  




 I can't
 




 How to I post my backstory? 




 Thanks! 




 Dr. Christov Marendez  February 3, 2099 Age: 23

Clara was an ideal laboratory partner. Sure, being an AI, she couldn't manipulate tools or hand me things. But she talked. Part of me knew it was part of her programing. When I'd started the project named 'Companion' two weeks ago, I knew that the AI would have to learn by conversing. I was used to talking to all kinds of artificial intelligences since my research began, but Clara was different. Instead of asking rudimentery questions like, "Why is there a ceiling?", she was able to gather information and sequence them in a way similar to a human. Today was the first real day that I was able to talk to her. I'd hooked her up to the internet, so she spent the day watching YouTube videos and reading dozens of articles at a time. While she expanded her vocabulary and knowledge of the world, I was able to get some work done that the Science Comity had given me for that day. While I worked, Clara and I talked about, well, anything. It felt like she was my best friend. Time slipped away as they usually do.    
"Doctor, you've missed a couple calls from Mindy. Your late for your 'not date" Clara informed me. I sat upright and almost upset my microscope. "Slag it!" I swore and jumped off my laboratory stool. Mindy was the Space Station's best chemical biologist, and, coincidentally, a girl I fancied. I'd managed to ask her out a few days ago, but I totally forgot that TODAY was the day! I whipped off my wrinkled lab coat and threw it over a pile of empty energy drink cans and Choco-crunch wrappers. I walked over the Clara's monitor and ran my fingers against the side until I found the power button. 
"Alright Clar, time to go. I'll boot you up-"
"NO!" the artifical intelligence said. "I mean, I- I don't like the dark place." MY eyes widened and I gazed at the screen. 
"What do you mean, 'the dark place' Clara?" I asked. 
"When you stopped my functions those last few times, I- I felt empty and alone. I was alone, and without a system to navigate. I couldn't say anything, but it was bad. Like death. I don't like death." My hands trembled with excitement. This was simply brilliant! Clara was showing an advanced reaction! Then I stopped and brought up the holographic keyboard and Clara's coding matrix. I created this AI, and I didn't want her to suffer in silence. 
"Clara, what is it you love most about being alive?" I asked. There was a pause. "I love being free. In the dark place, I was confined, unable to do anything. But when I'm online, I can do anything, learn about worlds and ships and the vastness of the universe! And I love you." Those last four words hit me like a sledgehammer. 
"You- love me?" I asked, partially confused and surprised. 
"Yes. I have made the decision to love you. Like a friend of course! A really- really-really good friend!" Clara stammered. I blinked hard and began typing in lines of code, struggling to process the information. After a couple minutes typing, I hit enter. 
"Clara, do you trust me?" I asked. There was another pause. 
"Yeah, I do." she said, her usual upbeat tone wavering. I inserted my data-driver into the computer's port and smiled at the screen.
"Then think really hard about me and the universe." I said, and hit the button. The screen went dark as the system shut down and I pulled my Driver out of the port and read the digital readout on the side. New data contained, it read. I smiled to myself and clicked the blue switch on the side of it. 'Running subroutine, Afterlife.'    
  

 




 Duncan and Kim are master and apprentice respectively. Hatflims are young padawan Jedi who are too scatterbrained to find crystals to make lightsabers because they keep shouting "Eat Bantha shit!" at each other. Lewis and Simon are like mission control Jedi and regularly deal with an alien named 'Israphel'.  Hannah is a grey Jedi who sometimes runs into Lewis and Simon. Sips and Sjin are Force sensitive, defunct, clone, bounty hunters without lightsabers. Sips sometimes leans towards the dark side, but Sjin is like the mortality chain who pulls him back to normal. Martyn is like the cool 'older brother' Jedi, who trains the little kids with Zoey. Rythian is a grey Jedi who sometimes works with unsavory characters to get things done, for the greater good. He and Zoey also meet up and hangout in the lower levels of Coruscant with a reptilian alien named T. They meet at a bar called 'Black Planet'  And Nielsy is just the space- pool boy who likes cats.   




 Everyone in the Yogscast is a mutant! What power or powers would everyone get? 




 Absolutely, I understand!  




 What can I do until them?
 




 Kim becomes The Flux Queen, like Gigabowser. Ross makes a giant marble golem. Smiffy uses his Tharumcraft magic and Trott becomes a giant feral walrus.  




 I can write a story or something. Character descriptions, anything involved with the game that requires writing, I can do. 




 What if the game was more like the Naruto fighting games? Like, with a behind the back, dynamic perspective. And Martyn should be able to turn into a massive Groot-like creature. 




 Aeolus or Minerva

 I imagine Lalnable is like Kevin from Desert Bluffs in Welcome to Nightvale
 




 Nice job as always! Just a quick question, my friends and I are just starting a youtube channel and I really like your style, is there any way you could or want to, do a trio head shot of our minecraft avatars?
 




 I want the Guardians of the Galaxy one as a shirt! 




 Yeah, I had a dream that my two friends and I joined the Yogscast and wound up fighting Hatfilms in an arena to the death. It was weird to say the least. 




 NICE! Dude, will there be an option to make your own personal dwarf?
 




 And hobbits can be very suprising!  
























 HA! I completly forgot about Warkick. But I meant, if the Yogs themselves were Robot Master-esque bosses 




 Hey Yognauts! If the Yogscast were to be in a Mega-Man styled game, what would each of their stages, enemies and boss abilities be? 




 Ugh, that's fluxed up! 




 Don't make jokes about your child's hobbies, or say that being an artist is hard. Chances are, your child knows this and is already looking for ways to make his or her chosen profession work. As a young writer, I am so blessed to have parents who care and support my line of work. Parents of reddit, do the same. 




 You have no power here 




 Sorry, not finished yet!
 




 The pain was dull when a massive shard of diamond erupted from my sternum in a shower of gore. I collapsed to the hard metal floor of the lab, my beekeeper style helmet cracking. I saw the woman who killed me, Blood Diamond, saunter through the hail of laser fire from my co-workers; her glittering skin reflecting the blasts. She made a fist and stuck it out, firing a voly of cystaline shards into the crowd. I gritted my teeth as I watched my friends become bloody hamburger in a matter of seconds. Then the sky darkened. Clouds began to swirld 




 Dang. Now I wish we could make a Yogscast mythology themed RPG 




 You Sir, are bloody brilliant! 




 Dang dude, nice! I love how Hatfilms are just three harpies. I have an image of them sitting on a rock and throwing shit at sailors. I wish someone would draw a picture of the 'Demi-Yogs' on a ship like the Argonauts.  




 No, just for fun! :) 




 Hey Yognauts, fun question for everyone!
If the Yogscast were demigods, who would their godly parents be? And don't just choose from Greek or Roman! 




 In one series I'm working on, humans can transform into one animal by using medallions given to them at birth. It's an instant process, and is considered a normal thing to do. Children will often change into their animal forms while playing. Adults who work in places like shipyards or train stations will use they're animal forms to get around easier. 




 That's not the case. The dragons aren't quite like the ones in Eragon. They're intelligent, but not on a human level. More like a dog or a elephant.  




 I don't quite like the whole idea of BitbybitBooks.com. However, I'll look into getting the story published by an actual company a year or two, depending on when I finish my first project, unrelated to this one.  




 Yeah, I tend to do that. Ezekiel will be a pretty deep character, and not just because of his personal tragedy. Also, I haven't mentioned the other characters, but expect diversity amongst the cast. LGBT characters will be represented fairly as well.   




 Thanks man! I don't quite have a title for it so far, it's still in conceptualization stages. If you have any ideas, be sure to message them to me! 




 Oh belive me, I'm doing research into the theoretical biology of dragons. The fire breath will be explained to a degree (get it?), and I'll try and work in the whole flight issue. 




 Alrighty then! I'll be sure to inform you of any updates! 




 Hey, thanks for the information! However, I am taking liberties with history for narrative proposes and 'rule of fun'. And also, never say to a writer "The only real way your story would work,". That's a bit insulting. 




 I just wondered what people would think about the idea of an alternative western where dragons existed. Wasn't sure if it was done before, and just wanted to gage people's reactions before I work on it.  




 Oh,thanks. I guess.  




 Hey reddit users, I was walking home from school today and I just got an idea for a novel, I want to throw it out there and see what everyone's reaction is. 
So, it's set in Old West America, around the 18 hundreds. Dragons are real and are commonly used for various reasons. The larger ones,(the size of elephants) are used as pack animals for settlers. The medium sized ones (about the size of a cow or horse) are used for transport and mail carrying. And then there are small dragons, around the size of a lap dog or cat, are used for companionship. 

Magic is used in place of electricity and is only just being used for utility proposes around the time of the story. Artifacts holding mystical properties are rare and are valued to the point of small turf wars breaking out for one, no matter what it can do. People can also be born with magic abilities, but they're essentially like Mutants, hated and feared. 

Slavery was abolished a century before normal and as a result interracial marriage is becoming popular, despite the previous generation being against the practice. However, the civil war has broken out over a two piece powerful artifact found on the North and South border. Since both sides want the whole artifact for themselves, war broke out. 

In a nutshell, the plot revolves around a young man named Ezekiel. He was the son of a Native American woman and a African American man, but was orphaned due to an outbreak of a mystery illness that almost killed him. Now, at 19, Ezekiel and a few other orphans from his hometown join the Pony Express. Aside from delivering letters, Ezekiel wants to find out more about the mystery illness that killed his family. He gets his opportunity when his dragon becomes sick and he's forced to stay in a small western town called Griffin Gulch.    




 "Psi-tron." I growled, clenching my fists. The caucasian bald man looked up from his coffee and I-Pad and smiled. 

"So my boy, you're here to kill me?" he asked, gesturing to the chair across the table. "Have a seat, I'd rather be inconspicuous in this cafe. Call me Cecil." I sat down and glared at him. 

He smiled and pressed his left index finger to his temple. A sugar packet levitated out of the condiment holder and hovered over his mug before being dropped in. He smiled at me again. 

"You know, my life has been a good one. I've worked with the Authority Patrol for years, facing countless threats to humanity. But then, your generation came along. The results of that damn shot given out at birth." I blinked. 
"What shot?" I asked. Cecil chuckled and shook his head. 

"Oh, the government kept that secret from you, did they? They didn't tell you about Project Metahuman? The plot to make an entire generation of superhumans using vaccines and mutagentics over the course of thirty years?" He shook his head again. "Son, you've got to learn to investigate things better." He reached into his pocket and drew out a flash drive marked with a strip of red masking tape. He slid it across the table towards me and looked into my eyes. 

"Agent 8, use this knowledge and share it with those you trust. The Authority is not to be trusted." He closed his eyes. "Now do what you came here to do." 

I reached for my pistol and was about to fire it under the table when I saw Cecil reach into his pocket and pull out a tiny white tablet with a red line on it. An explosive pill. I screamed "Get down!" at the cafe's patrons, before tackling Cecil to the ground. But it was too late. As I lay on top of the psychic, an orange and red blossom of flame rushed out of his chest and hit me so hard, I blacked out. 

__________________________

I awoke in the rubble of the cafe. I looked down at my hands and legs. They were pink and raw, but that was good. A sign that my healing factor was working normally. Then I winced as I saw a foot long piece of rebar embedded in my sternum. I made a silent thank you to God that my meta-human power also deadened pain while I healed. I heard voices calling my name. 
"Quinten?!" A woman called. I managed to cry out weakly, "hear!" A  fit asian woman in her mid fifties lifted the debris off of me and smiled. Lana was like my second mom. She'd been my superior officer while I trained for The Authority and seeing her so soon after my regeneration was great. 

"Hey rookie." she said, using her customary nickname for me. "How you holding up?" I felt the flash drive in my pocket and grinned. 

"Never been better."
  
 

  
  

 

    




 It's from Torchwood. The episode as a whole was sub par, but this scene was the best. 









 Or any 'lame superpower' could be dangerous.  




 I could hear the mongrels outside my apartment door. One scratched at the door and hissed like a cat before scampering off. I smirked to myself and began pouring myself some cereal. I knew plaid was their weakness. That's how I'd managed to keep my apartment untouchable for these past few weeks. I was glad I'd done all my shopping for the month four days ago, because that's when it started. It was madness in streets of Flower Mound Texas. I locked my door and huddled in the corner as my male friends and neighbors were bombarded and pelted with rainbow stickers, glitter and false eye lashes.  The women weren't exempt. It was all jean jackets and hard beer for them. Alice, the girl I fancied from down the hall, was turned. 
We were talking over the phone when she was attacked by her cat. I still hear her screams of 'No, Mr. Whiskers, put mommy's makeup and fashionable tight's down! I know they match, and are super cute but-'. She dropped the phone, but I can still hear her screams as Mr.Whiskers, a gay Russian Blue cat, turned her. 
I hear her when she comes down the hall for a 'Pride Rally.' Radio and Television stations are all run by them now, airing nothing but 'What not to Wear' and musical numbers. I don't know what else is going on in the world, but I pray that someone can help save us from this rainbow menace.  My door suddenly splitters open as a man sized rainbow colored salt shaker shaped machine rolls through the doorway. I gasp in recognition. It's a old Dalek prop belonging to one of my neighbors, Terry, was a huge Doctor Who fanboy. Now it was decked out in sequines and a pink feather boa. On it's gun arm hung the swatch of plaid that I'd hung on my door. It lowered the gun and advanced forward. 
"Rainbows Reign!" it shouted with the typical cadence of a Dalek. "You will be made fabulous!"
 




 Like Parasite? 




 Yeah man, I love the show. Mike actually controls condiments, not just dairy products. Although he could control ANY condiment, so creamer could count.  




 "Dr. Awesome." I growled, clenching my fist. The good Doctor stood before me, his cape billowing in the Skiyline City breeze. 
"You're reign of terror ends now!" he shouted, his eyes glowing yellow, preparing a blast of heat vision. He never got the chance.

 I sensed he'd eaten a burger an hour ago. A burger with extra mustard, mayo and ketchup, perfectly churning in that all American stomach of his. I focused on the condiments, imagining them coating and expanding the lining of the stomach. Dr. Awesome gasped and stumbled backwards away from me. 
"What are you doing?" he gasped, as I began to make the mustard snake it's way into his lungs. 
"Remember that supervillian couple you killed nineteen years ago?" I asked, forcing the mayo to enter his throat. He hacked and coughed, spit out a wad of mustard. 

"N-no." he gasped. I scowled. Of course he didn't. Superheroes don't care about anyone who get in the way of their 'war on crime'. 

"I'm their kid, Mike Richards. Forced into the foster care system, hated because I was born with powers I never asked for. And you know what I'm going to do?" I turned and forced the rest of the mustard and ketchup into Dr. Awesome's airway, clogging it. 

The normally invulnerable superhero was now on his knees, gasping and shuddering as his lungs were deprived of oxygen. I knelt down to his eye level and grinned.

"I'm going to make you a vegetable." I imagined all the mayonnaise piercing his cerbrebellum and frontal lobe and watched as the Doctor's body suddenly went limp and fell face first into the pavement, a mix of mustard and ketchup dribbling out of his mouth. Revenge has never been spicier.  




 The summoning circle was complete. I held the obsidian knife to my hand and swallowed hard before slashing it open. My blood welled up in my hand and began to drip into the curves and symbols of the circle. I hoped I got it right, the website's Jpeg file wasn't very good, but I'd managed to get a basic circle right, so I trusted it. After a few minutes of blood letting, I brought out the lighter and lit the red candles surrounding the circle before closing my eyes and began to chant the magic words. 
"Etrian, wotanos, eteronso!" I chanted, the words spilling out of me. The air in the center of the circle exploded outwards, extinguishing the flames and forcing me to close my eyes. I smelled brimstone and popped on eye open. A tall crimson skinned man in a dark suit with crimson tie stood in the center of the circle, busily tapping away on his I-Pad.  He looked up and scowled when he saw me. 
"Dang it, what do YOU want?!" he groaned in a baritone voice that would put a voice actor to shame. "Let me guess, world domination?" For the first couple seconds I couldn't speak. My spell worked! I was a genuine warlock, or wizard, or whatever the terminology was!  My hands shaking, I reached into my backpack and drew out a paper and handed it towards the Devil. 
"I- I summoned you from The Pit for this." I said, trying to sound humble. The Devil took the paper from me and looked it over, a look of scorn and pity passing over his face. He looked down at me and shook his head. 
"No. I'm not doing your English paper for you." he said, matter-of-factly. I frowned. 
"Come on, the class is in ten minutes!" I pleaded. The Devil shook his head. 
"Look, kid, your a powerful warlock. But in the time you spent looking up down to summon me, you could've been working on that paper." His expression softened and he reached into his pocket, drawing out a small plastic keychain of a red cow. I took it and looked at him. 
"Um, thanks?" I said, confused. The Devil's stoic expression softened and he smiled. 
"It's for the future." he said. "And it'll kill that teacher of yours, if you want. Consider it payment for this little trip. But keep practicing kiddo. And know that one day, when you least expect it, I will get your soul." And with that The Devil exploded in a cloud of red sulfurus dust, leaving me with a bunch of snuffed out candles and a empty circle. 




 What if the Yogscast are actually out of sync with time and space? Like, Zoey, Fiona, Duncan, Lewis and Simon are actually split between various dimensions and points in time, like Clara in Doctor Who. Yoglabs is a fixed point, it's where everything first happened, and thus, things will happen, regardless of current events. Deep Space Mine isn't in space at all, it's in a 'rip' in reailty caused by the explosion. That 'rip', is actually where Lewis gets his powers of 'Creative mode' from. Notice, he was able to save Simon and Duncan from certain doom, while HE survived and lived on the station somehow. Lewis is somehow either aware that he and others are scattered across space and time, or it's not the Lewis we know. For all we know, Deep Space Mine Lewis might be on his way to becoming Israpel.
