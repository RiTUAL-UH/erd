 No. 




 This is precisely the type of intellect that successfully crashed the gun legislation in the Senate. Keep up the brilliant rhetoric. 




 So every gun is misused, but the internet is only occasionally misused by pedophiles? Yeah... 




 I'm only asking  - if you want the government monitoring every weapon, why not allow for them to monitor every email? 





























 So you don't trust the government to monitor your internet activity, but you trust them to be the only ones with big guns? Brilliant. 




 why would buying a gun mean a school shooting? More people use the internet to harm children than use guns to harm children. 




 I'm questioning the validity of regulating either. Loughner had a legally purchased handgun when he went after Giffords but she is advocating banning AR15's? To me it's the equivalent of one saying "I'm the victim of a hate crime, it's time we ban CO2 emissions". 




 'The people that around me' care deeply about your personal sympathies. 




 Every knife is designed to kill as well. But most don't. It depends whos hands you place it in. The same for guns, the Internet, vehicles, fertilizer etc. Anything can be misused in the wrong hands. But we should just monitor everything all the time to be safe and to protect the children.
