 Go with the Samsung, their Samsung SSD Magician software taks the guess work out of configuring the OS to best suit your SSD. 














 And for the record the SR71 flew at such a stupendously high altitude there was no chance of a collision. 




 As I said, I'm over you. 
You're probably feeling like a great keyboard warrior, but really you're coming across like a massive douchebag. 




 I'm actually over you. 




 Couldn't agree more.

If you ever get the opportunity to see one either fly or up close, take it, they're majestic beasts. 




 [edited]

Look, my point was if there was an unfortunate series of events, the TCAS is the last hope to avoid a collision. 

Without their transponder operational, TCAS is useless.

I'm not saying they ever got close enough to cause this, or ever intended to but having their transponder off in such an environment (around civvie aircraft) is reckless, surely you could agree to that. 




 [edit]

TCAS has and will continue to saves lives should the absolute worst happen, and while the Russians may be stellar points, murphy's law dictates everyone can fuck up, and having your transponder on can avoid turning a mistake into anything worse. 




 It was humungous. I saw it fly, it almost appears to hover in mid-air. 




 5 foot 7 inches = 67inches.
According to Ask.com the average Banana is around 8inches,
So I'm 8 banana's tall. 









 Ah, sorry I misunderstood. They had to blow it out of proportion for a good media show!  




 The point is they required flights to be diverted away, which means they were enough of a threat -close enough to to an air corridor to warrant be a threat.

Of course you *can* fly without a transponder anywhere in the world, however if you're going to do it next to/around a busy commercial air corridor expect trouble.. 




 A plus 1 for you Sir. 




 The reason they had to be escorted away immediately is because the world has a very effective and proven collision avoidance system, but but it relies on an active [transponder](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision_avoidance_system) which the douchebags had turned off. 

Do you really think this would have been so funny if a commercial airliner collided with one of these guys because that was a real possibility.

You can't just fly in international airspace without your transponder on, that is just incredibly arrogant and puts lives at risk. 

Of course they knew this was going to happen the moment they flew into commercial airspace. 

For fucks sake why are they risking an international disaster by bringing down an airliner in a mid air collision while the world is itching for an excuse to start WW3? 




 Petrol starts to naturally break down, and only lasts a few months once it's been processed.

 I've just freshly installed it into chrome, thank you for suggesting it. I couldn't agree more about the devs implementing it, would result in less edits, and more intelligible posts.

However for people who don't/can't use Chrome I feel it would be a well used feature, and can't fathom why it's not included. 




 Ah, thank you will install on my Desktop.

Although I use Opera mobile when browsing and posting on the go (so most of the time) so having a feature which isn't browser dependent would be nice.

 No, 2 reasons why I think not:
1- when you have testers in the field you're introducing the human element, and exposing it to be be seen by eagle eyed enthusiasts. Or just simply left in your local pub.. (e.g.infamous iPhone debacle)

2- If you want something released for public consumption it needs to be certified, and with certification companies releasing their records almost immediately. (E.g htc One camera leaked.)

 Proper green stone jewelry, an appalling amount (especially the stuff in the tourist shops) is actually cheap Chinese jade.

If you want proper Greenstone rock on over to the Westcoast. Any reputable seller will happily tell you where it's from.

Be prepared to fork out a bit for it though, proper greenstone can be quite expensive due to Ngai Tahu's exclusive rights to sell it.

 Ah I see. I'll report that then. App dev's aught to be paid for their hard work.
Also Reddit post says:
"submitted 19 hours ago by [deleted]" hence why I thought your account was deleted! Odd. 




 My point was (however ineloquently stated) why should we report it, you need a valid reason. Just saying "an app for piracy" is useless without a context, like maybe this dude had his app stolen? 

Secondly don't link to it with the main header, as that just piques your interest into downloading it, which rather defies the original purpose of the post. 

That makes me think this was thinly veiled (and rather shameless) advertising. 

But then that probably explains why the dude's deleted his account.

Every day man! :-) 









 Well I can thank you for putting me right. 
I strive to make at least semi educated comments, and it's become apparent I have missed the mark here somewhat. Consider me enlightened. :-) 




 I respect what you're saying, but as a layman I have only my opinions based upon reported isolated incidents- articles like this? And other stories brought to me by the media. 
I only know what I read on the internet, and (as with most subjects) what the media portrays. 

Based upon the above my comment still stands however based upon my opinion formed. 

As you're educated on the subject I understand where you're coming from and it must be frustrating to read comments like mine, but let's be honest here, it's not likely to change as the media aren't going to change how they report things of this nature - e.g. "anticorruption measure" stories will get buried amongst stories about corrupt officials each and every time, so can you blame me?  




 I'm saying the country as a whole is very average - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_India

"..But many analysts believe India's sprawling bureaucracy and weak institutionsthe police and judiciary were ranked as the second and third most corrupt institutions in India, respectively, after political partieshave thwarted convictions, and arguably increased incentives for bribery. In recent years, graft pervaded society from small-scale "harassment bribes" (payments for essential social services) to scandals on a national level. At least 42 percent of young Indians have paid a bribe, according to a 2012 Hindustan survey"
[source](http://www.cfr.org/corruption-and-bribery/governance-india-corruption/p31823)

And I specifically refer to the corrupt judge's trial - http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bribery-charges-trial-against-judge-may-finally-begin/article4978237.ece

And now this, which the high court has thrown out as clearly some very dodgy motions were passed without due diligence. 




 Just got home, baby is in bed, I'm on Reddit to unwind after a bloody long day! I'm a kiwi so 7.30pm here!  :-) 














 The night mode didn't adjust for 'night mode' at all. Then I went into my default Samsung camera, selected Night Mode, then hopped out and back into 'a better camera' and voila - night mode activated.

Also flicking between front and back screens causes the camera to freeze for around 2 seconds.

Also changing to and from Video - camera mode causes screen to freeze, need to escape it and get back in.

And HD video quality is piss poor when pixel peeping vs stock Samsung S4.

On the PLUS side, takes very nice HDR photos.

 Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you my Prime Minister.. 




 I found Opera crashed frequently, but that was a few months ago I last tried it.

To be honest my phone didn't feel "right" after installing it, Apps were a bit slow to respond, and crashed infrequently, but often enough to make me uninstall, and everything went back to normal.  




 Thank you kindly good sir.

Edit: Actually it is a much better low-light camera than the standard App, (Samsung S4) as it focuses better, and with the HDR mode always on, offers an advantage over the HDR mode over the Stock S4 camera as HDR has to be selected everytime, through a rather clunky menu. 

Very good, and hell, it's free so always a worth a shot! 




 Perhaps forgive my ignorance, but why not take the SIM card out and put it into your phone? The contacts may be old, but could still have "mum"or "dad".

 Best comment I've seen on Reddit for a very long time. 

Nice.  




 Actually 4K is rather useful for video editors and even downsampled to 1080p is actually significantly higher quality than native 1080p.

Also with 4K TV's becoming eye poppingly cheap it's quite affordable for people replacing their current sets. 

And furthermore given the competitor has been offering this feature for a while you can't tell me there's not a market for it. 




 Yes, but as I mentioned earlier the 4mp module on the HTC M8 simply doesn't have the same dynamic range of the higher pixel sensors resulting in washed out highlights and lack of detail in the shadows.

I agree Apple have things right - they've gone with 8mp coupled with phenomenal software support resulting in one of the best cameras for an all round solution. 

I have an S5 and cannot understand how awesome the phase detection is for focusing, especially in low light. But why they didn't incorporate all the technologies into a single unit is beyond me.

I'm hoping HTC pull finger and release an awesome unit (phase detection/range finder/OIS), coupled with fantastic camera software (Zoe?) and just blow everyone out of the water. 




 I don't know if you read the review, they had to deliberately cool the phone down between benchmarks. LG were contacted who advised they are still tweaking the final product, so perhaps it was a pre-release hiccup.

I reckon Qualcomm have got a lot riding on this after Samsung's snubbing, so I daresay they'll be working closely with LG to ensure there are no issues. 




 No. 
Extra megapixels also allow you to crop photos after you've taken them.
Extra megapixels allow higher quality (read:4k) camera capabilities.
(Note this last point may be why HTC rumours indicate 2 camera modules on the M9? - 1 high pix for UHD video, other Low "ultrapix" module.)
 




 You have to hand it to HTC, however you needn't look any further than the decision by Sony to [release the Z3 as a 1080 screen](http://au.ibtimes.com/xperia-z3-sony-unwilling-sacrifice-battery-life-2k-smartphones-1368833) which they were slated for and forced to explain why. (Battery life of course..)

However it proves the world (as of September 2014) wants 1440+ higher screen sizes in their flagships, so it's going to be a risky move. Then again HTC are if anything happy to take risks! 




 It was extremely hampered by early reviews and the narrow dynamic range. GSMarena slated it as even when down grading the competitors camera from X-4MP they still did significantly better. 
(I will say except for low light, where the camera excelled but realistically most people want a good all rounder than an awesome 1-thinger.)  




 Bother. Thank you very much for answering my question :) 




 I missed having a flashlight widget too much.. Or have they fixed that?  




 Thanks, that's a good idea. 




 No offence, but isn't that cutting off my nose to spite my face? I still want to listen to music on my phone, I just don't like the spotify wakelock keeping my phone awake when I've already closed Spotify! 




 I do. 

It's just frustrating that it's not a 'feature' I can turn off, as I usually (as most people do.) turn my phone off and keep listening on their desktop, not realizing their phones are quietly still running.  




 I was listening to music on my mobile, but closed it via the X on the notification widget. However when I started listening soon after on my desktop I still had Spotify controls on my lock screen only. 

I guess the *feature* here is you can pause/next your music without going back to the Application on your desktop. The severe downside is it keeps a wakelock open, draining your phones battery.

Because it doesn't display the ability to shutdown (No widget in the Notification centre) so I've found the only way to stop the wakelock is to Force Stop the Spotify Process in Android Application Management.

Ignore if this doesn't bother you, but I use Spotify on my desktop to save my battery life, which makes it kinda pointless to keep my phone awake.

 We need an ELI5 for saturation points on phones.

I mean yes there are still untapped markets, but most of those won't be buying 2k screens at current flagship prices, so how can they gaze into their crystal ball and say 2k are going to be the mainstay when most people don't want over 5.5 inch devices, and with the market flooded with such devices why your average Joe would choose a 2k screen over last years flagship with a normal HD panel?

 The simple fact is people will do stupid shit and try and run regardless of whether the police will chase them, in nz we've had quite a few people die from smashing their car after the police have even called off chases minutes before.

You can't apply rationality to irrational people. 




 I see your point, but I would argue it was made our business the moment they went public. 




 That's an interesting, and probably quite accurate account, as it explains the medical check too. 




 Weird. 

I get the feeling we really got kept in the dark/were deliberately misinformed and mislead over this whole story. 

Like they wanted to paint a picture of what an awesome person she was so we'd keep an eye out for her.

While negating to inform us the circumstances under which she was found, and then offering us the teaser "She was checked by medical personnel" makes me believe she was far from the perfect mother etc portrayed by the media.
 




 That was sooooo satisfying to watch.

People running from the police are so fucking selfish, it's good to see some good old fashioned street justice. 




 Oh, so they love to know where you are without a warrant, but god help you if you want to find out where they are?

 Actually captured him quite well. Good job. 




 However he's also managed to oversee a government which has approved some of of the most utterly appalling environmentally crippling policies like allowing dumping on the Great Barrier reef. 

He's also attracted world wide ridicule by attempting to deny climate change. 




 I hope so. 

the ISOCELL is a very interesting development in Pixel technology, I strongly believe that when paired with a good OIS it will bring superior low light performance over standard BSI OIS sensors. 




 I was kinda hoping for an ISOCELL OIS camera module, but 20MP doesn't sound like it.
The Sony IMX240 equipped Note4 with OIS wasn't the best in low-light.

Still very exciting! 









 I'm sorry but are they fucked in head? 

Fuck this makes me angry. 
Fucking greedy corporations who can't be fucked to clean up their act. 
Egged on by fucking greedy politicians who want their campaign money. 
And stupid fucking residents for allowing this to happen.

The environment is just fucked. Doesn't even stand a chance. 




 There are more than one ways to skin a cat - like with Sony's curved sensor array promising higher light sensitivity!

The simple (and tragic fact) is more/bigger pixels are not feasible while the market craves smaller devices.

 Android RAM management has become significantly better than older Android versions. These days with richer Applications and more RAM than ever before actually clearing your RAM can result in an impact to battery life as the OS needs to reload the Apps back into the RAM you just cleared. (For instance most Opera Mobile using desktop mode has over 200-300MB of RAM constantly.)

Likewize with Application cache (the other reason people use them) I can appreciate people who have very limited device storage using them, but they're a crutch as if you have to use it more than once a week due to space issues, chances are you need to upgrade your phone anyway. 




 lol. Then you'll get people complain about the noise, you can't win! :D 




 I appreciate that sentiment, I don't know what phone you have, but the S5's "phase detection autofocus" is light and day difference over the not-awful S4's focus.

but yes, I hear you on the low light issue. 
This is something that needs to be fixed on the sensor as IOS is not the silver bullet we need.

(From the screenshot comparisons between the S5 and Note4 (although different sensor Sony IMX240 vs Samsung's Isocell) the differences for the lowlight shots are not as awesome as I expected the OIS to be able to perform with the Note4.) 




 Had a wee chuckle at your comment- brings back memories!
 




 Well said. 




 It is but it's certainly a step in the right direction. I think most consumers have come to accept a slight protrusion, however 12mm (plus screen etc so more like 15mm) might be a tad thick. However you are getting 3x optical zoom!

 I know! They make fantastic (if horrendously expendy) filters too, so I have little doubt this module will be to a high quality standard.

Can't wait for camera samples. 




 The way I read it makes it sound like she blamed the bus for not being loud enough, so she didn't bother looking. 




 My S4 took significantly better photos (edit: In good light!) than our $600 Fujifilm EXR from 2011 though. 

People who want better quality will always buy a better dedicated camera, I'm talking about the entry level ($100 cameras etc.) 




 Nah, it's only a suggestion. :) 




 Indeed, the only digital zoom I'll ever appreciate is the Nokia Lumia Pureview digital zoom implementation. 




 Yeah, I hope that Stuff have just edited out that little sound bite out of context, because blaming the bus for being silent and then admitting you didn't bother looking doesn't make her come across as the sharpest knife in the drawer.

Of course if she's a Redditor and would like to defend herself I welcome her side of the story. (If there's more to it.) 




 Thanks, I didn't realise it was also stabilised! 

Yes, however due to the fact it was developed by a 3rd party - Hoya I'm hoping it's not patented to Asus, and could potentially make an appearance on other devices. 









 I really wish I could post this to the r/nottheonion/ but Stuff are such a shit tabloid news site they don't accept submissions any more from there! Anyway, this is pure Darwinism in action. 

I also laughed at the fact they had comments which had to be disabled, I'm guessing due to the fact they ripped this girl a new one for actually blaming the bus for being "silent".  









 NZ, no such luck in our High Schools unfortunately, although that was 10 years ago so things may have changed, but I doubt it.

Not even as an optional study, I would have taken that class in a heartbeat. 




 That is very cool that you get taught about the myths though. 




 You have myths class?!  




 Awesome, gosh that was quick!
I'm surprised this ran on your phone, it doesn't support Kit-Kat.

Tap 'main' does it expand to further info?
Also please display "CPU_wakelocks" (press circle icon)
 




 The silly thing is the fact most Applications on your cellphone can do this, and much much more: 
See your photos, record your voice, view your location hostory, view your website history.

Yet everyone just clicks the "Install" button without a second thought.

Yet God forbid a company are actually OPEN about the fact that in order to provide you a service using your voice they WARN you that your voice is being recorded.

Come on people. Props to Samsung for being open about this at least. 




 LG are just as bloody bad!
"LG smart TVs send data about users' files and viewing habits to the company"

 Anyone else reminded of the movie "Alive"?  




 Brutal.  




 Well you see on your graph how the 'awake' is damn near a constantly solid line! 
While your Screen on graph is only sporadic and doesn't match with your 'awake' line.

This basically indicates there's errant background processes which is sapping your battery life.

These errant processes are usually:
Google scanning for your location (as requested by Adware on your cellphone)
Google Now waking up your phone to either see your location or present you new cards.
Weather Apps/widgets updating.
Email/Facebook apps updating themselves.
Background data use (think Spotify/music playing etc.)

The best way to determine what's sapping your battery life is to get Wakelock Detector.
(However due to the fact Google are bastards they don't want you to be able to access the indepth analysis battery stats.)
So you need to use a work around (nothing scary!).

Step 1- acquire a windows PC.
Step 2- Go here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r3VlhZIZVSufZlAeICJet6QBtyAF7z06_ysl1kUKME4/edit#slide=id.g298bc178a_00
Step 3- follow instructions.

I've done it a few times now, this will allow you to actually see your Wakelock stats (so in effect that's sapping your battery life by waking up your phone!)

Once you have your Wakelock stats post a screenshot on this subreddit can we can help you to determine what's the matter. 




 Sweet jesus man. Your battery life must be awful.

Are you worried about your battery life? What do you get - my year old S4 got 4hours SOT /8 hours standby.
 









 But is upping the pixels the best way to do this?  




 To answer the op, technically no. But it's very relative to your previous experience with screens. 

What I mean is if you haven't had an amoled before and look at the note 4 you may think the color and other amoled properties are a QHD attribute. 


There's the old (and very relevant) issue of the human eye simply being unable discern the individual pixels, above a certain dpi. 

This shouldn't be ignored, however at 5.7 inches I'm willing to believe those with extremely good eye sight can see a difference under optimum conditions. 

Is it worth it (I know not what op asked, but these two questions are closely related) for most people an awesome FHD amoled will provide the same wow factor and provide awesome battery life. 




 I feel mislead by the title, I thought op meant Don Hertzfeldt's rejected: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkrJB7Q0X3Q 









 There's something deeply insidious about this. 




 Does it play clash of titans?  




 How many people clicked the link just to see the lesbians kiss? Come on.. you know you did. 




 What aren't dashcams good for?! 

Seriously, there are now entire Youtube channels dedicated to dashcam footage from Europe.

And now just entertainment, we've benefitted scientifcally with detailed footage of meteor showers for instance.

And now one's capture a freaking commercial plane crash! That's awesome. 




 Considering what that man has done for science - take it out of the classroom and into millions of peoples living rooms I'm stoked someone has found an appropriate way to ensure his legacy will live on. (Aside from DVD and Bluray sales of his shows of course.)

It's a great honour and bestowed upon a worthy person. 




 Plot twist: all 4 dead were found in the morgue!

Thank^you^I'll^let^myself^out 




 Thousands of men all around the around laugh nervously and cross their legs. 




 What's the icon?!
 




 You're right, and "State commisioned murder" has such a lovely ring to it.. /s! 









 It just adds to the abhorrent nature of the crime commited by the police.

I think the wording was carefully chosen in the article to articulate the difference between the police forces.

The ranks of the elite riot police wear **riot gear** for protection. 

The ranks of these scum wear **masks** for anonymity. 




 There's something deeply wrong on so many levels as that sentence: "masked police". 

Any police that are wearing masks are instantly not worthy if the title "police". They are criminals posing as police. 









 Samsung have a reasonable video editor in their "Samsung store".

I can edit videos taken, and then compile my own videos from the clips on my Samsung s4.

Maybe see if there's an alternative for your device? Or see if you can acquire and sideload the apk?  




 So chump change for them then? 
This is the rich making the poor on a merry dance while their friends rob them blind.  




 This is a genius post! Catch upvotes by laying a trap for all the lonely posts without upvotes. 
Outstanding logic.  




 Your parents were probably having some fun to the #1 song on Sunday, July 27th 1986 which was: 
Sledgehammer by Peter Gabriel

Too much information. 




 sadly no....... I'm sure it's out there! 




 I know. Well done on doing your homework, it's stuff like this that I'm sure Stuff aren't allowed to post for fear of their masters coming down on them. 

It's sickening really. Unfortunately it's never going to change, ultimately it is only going to get worse. 

As governments the world over have shown big business owns legislation to ensure they continue to make squillions of profit unimpeded. 




 That's.. Awful. 




 I know right!? Something is a bit smelly with the whole affair. 




 you needed a /s there! :P But yes, that's basically their thought process. 




 lol, no.. 




 It's the impact to the image of the company they represent that the company are worrying about.

For instance an older person might hear a rumour that 2 married employees have an affair and will choose to take their business elseware. A younger person however would go "whatever." so given this is an insurance company, they will be looking at the age etc of their clientele to determine whether this is enough to make people not use them. 

Of course the other side of the coin is that the company may realise (perhaps after an analysis from a PR agency which I daresay is already happening) that they in fact gained from their employees indiscretion and may allow them to keep their jobs.  




 Personally, I still do, but the wife went to Whittakers long ago. 
They still have a humungous following regardless of their piss poor business choices. 

Then again in NZ there's only a duopoly - Whittakers and Cadbury. 




 They got lax. They released bad business decision - changes to their product - after bad decision with no mea-culpa it's all "To protect our increasing profits." 




 Haha, I tried last night. However surely someone can find it!? 




 Judging by some of the commentators it was at least 30 minutes, so there's that. 




 Indeed. 

What's the easiest way to lessen the blow of any change in their core product - give away free shit.

Where's the free shit Cadbury!? 




 Right, which makes the profit, coupled with this announcement all the more brutal. 




 Ha-de-ha. You think this isn't part of what's going to happen in your part of the world too? 




 I have to wonder if the marketing genius's at Cadburys saw how well the announcement went down for Whittakers and presumed they could pull the same stunt? 




 Also (I don't know how much Australian choco makes it to NZ shores) but the Aus arm of Cadbury posted a humungous profit last year -

**CHOCOLATE maker Cadbury recorded a $127 million profit in the year Prime Minister Tony Abbott promised the company a $16 million grant to revive factory tours.**

 And Aussie too...... They forgot the NZ public have memory like elephants, companies are not easily forgiven for messing with an iconic product! 














 If I find it I'll post it! 
Edit: found this, just from the news

 True. Although if true you have to spare a thought for their families... what a time. 




 Just their building, not their employees as I understand. But yes, free publicity regardless! 
 




 Oh. dear....... God this gets worse and worse for them.. 




 It was harmless until the name of the company was released, by the company. As mentioned earlier, they may have made it worse for themselves a bit. 




 You're probably not even half wrong...... 




 Perhaps, we can but wonder really. Probably bystander effect too, everyone else thought everyone else would do something. (if you get what I mean?) 




 lol, they hopefully won't, the whole flying the corporate team into CHCH for damage control seems a bit overkill though. 




 Actually, really good point. In this day and age sometimes a good denial and complete media silence is the best policy. 




 A comment on the article would lead you to believe the guy did. Worst possible way to be caught if that is the case..  




 If it was the second floor as mentioned earlier, can't exactly knock on the window.. 




 It's not that they were having sex, it's having sex with the lights on beside a busy pub. 

Bear in mind cellphone camera's aren't the best low-light cameras, so for the some of the clips to be such good quality one can only presume they were lit up like a xmas tree.  




 Haha, fair call.. 




 Ah, thank you for the clarification. 

Still clearly (judging by the photos) visible to outside though..  




 I'm sure they'll be somewhere in imgur.. I would search but on a work machine. :D 




 You feel sorry for them, but in the same breath, having the lights on at street level.. You have to wonder if it was deliberate (hence the 'caught'.)

I also really hope it was all above board, and wasn't an affair, that's perhaps the worst way for an affair to come to light.. 














 Very true.
