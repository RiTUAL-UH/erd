 They can take control of your character? Here comes the hackers forcing us to F11 ourselves. 




 **How often do you visit and participate on this subreddit? Are there any factors that would affect your participation?**

Answer: I am quite new to the Day Z subreddit, but during the day I will take a quick look at the subreddit, but then at one point in the day I will look through most of the day's new posts, and see if there are any new "Hot" ones.

**Is there anything on the subreddit would you like to be involved with in particular? Contests and events? Weekly thread maintenance? Helping style the CSS? Other?**

   Answer: I am quite familiar with Cascading Style Sheet, so of course I would appreciate helping out with the      styling of the subreddit. It would also be my pleasure to help out with the weekly thread maintenance.

**Are there any concerns with the subreddit right now that you would tackle as a Moderator? What are they, and how would you go about addressing them?**

   Answer: One of my main concerns for the subreddit right now, would be the amount of content surronding the hackers of DayZ and how so many people in the subreddit spend most of their time complaining about them. I would like to keep the subreddit mostly positive and focus on the good things about DayZ and it's development.

**Do you have any new suggestions for current moderation standards, new weekly threads, or other improvements? Yes or no will suffice here, we're not here to steal your ideas (unless you want to share them anyway, that's cool too)!**

   Answer: Twitter updates from the developers is one of the most important updates that are released on the subreddit because that is our main source of information, so I would suggest moderators keep a close eye upon the twitter feed of the developers.

**Despite best intentions and efforts, there will always be users who will criticize your actions, make false accusations, or otherwise put you down. How have you dealt with discontent, disapproval, or disagreement in the past, and how are you prepared to handle this criticism in a position of power?**

   Answer: Criticism is a standard within the gaming community, most of us deal with it everyday, to me it has no negative effect, sometimes criticism can make us more open minded, and appreciate other people's opinions more than before, when I have dealt with criticism I try and stay positive with it, although most of the time within gaming criticism is an attempt to put other gamers down. I am prepared to handle criticism without responding with criticism, so not to feed the person.

**Why do you want to be a Moderator?**

   Answer: I want to be a moderator because the Day Z subreddit is a fantastic community where users can share their opinions and creativity. So I would love to let the creativity continue, and make it easy for DayZ players to share their screenshots, recordings, ect.

**Do you have any prior moderation experience on reddit?**

   Answer: I have had no past experience with moderation on reddit.

**When did you join r/DayZ? What is your in-game experience like?**

   Answer: About a week ago, my first post received criticism upon the fact many people believed I used MS paint to stretch out my image to attempt to make the aspect ratio seems like 16:9 but the community has been welcoming else where. My gaming experience within Day Z so far has been trying to help other players, but always being blind sided by them players.

Thank you for reading this application.
 




 I think I know the solution; Run really fast into a wall with your arm pointing at it. Either you will fix the arm, or it will provide you with extreme pain. Good luck. 




 They are so blind. 




 I think Hackers target small pop servers because then they can get to everyone within the server. 




 Hacking is already occuring in H1Z1? I might go read their subreddit for all of the people posting "Er mah gerd, hacker in server". 




 Sometimes you just have to let go of your AKM. 




 People just don't learn. 




 Bye. 




 Did you know that Day Z isn't the only game that has hackers within it? Did you know that nearly every single game can be hacked using C++?
Did you know whining on the subreddit won't get hackers stopped anytime soon? How about you write some code that can stop hackers, send it to the developers and leave a little "Your Welcome" note with it. GG no re.  




 I wasn't facing North, I simply just took a picture because I was on the way to meet up with some people I know.  














 "I'm an artist because I can make a computer add 2 numbers" 




 Someone went on a duping rampage in Cherno... 




 I don't think that it should be a mask, print those designs on to balaclavas. 









 You forgot one: no servers 




 I have a feeling that the streamer was dominating all other players in the server with those airdrops. 
























 There is plenty of people who would give people one on one support like AceCool. 




 A lot of people in Australia would be on Free TV, that is where you can find this Television channel I am talking about. If you go to One (Name of the channel) if you go up one (to SBS radio) then up again. You get to see a channel that has a moderate amount of static, there is no shows being broadcasted just a Windows Vista looking desktop, with russian words in all 4 corners. There is a program open, may be Task Manager due to it saying "Processes" in the program, but the reason it is strange to me, is that there is an error.  




 DayZ is a "survival" game, I don't think it would help it to stay as survival if there was airdrops
 




 Yes, the helicopter will land, but only my Character will eject from the helicopter. 




 Make a link post. I wouldn't consider it lucky because some of the gear may be impossible to get. 




 Ok I sent you a Skype Contact Request. 




 I am new to creating missions for ARMA II using the editor and I am creating a small scale mission. I am trying to make an insertion in a blackhawk, except when it lands, it only ejects me and not the rest of my squad. The squad is grouped to the player, but the player isn't grouped to the chopper. 




 Playermodels? If so make sure you have FastDL for the server. 




 *Admin bans them* 




 Really? Making people pay to learn Garry's Mod LUA? Why would anyone pay for this when people like cosmicseagull makes tutorials that are free on youtube. 




 Don't even try to hack. Use money printers in the server, put them underground and somewhere no one will hear it or see it. 




 What "stuff" are you stuck on? 




 Driving threw Cherno in a V3S isn't counted as "running" through the town. 




 First actual good use of that quote. 




 Game would probably still be broken by then, how about 3 years? 




 3 or 4 I am not really sure. 




 No GPS, 1/10 




 Bondage Fetish. 




 One quick question. Why are you wearing a school girl dress? 




 Go on a heli run around Green Mountain, that's where you will find an M4 or an AUG.
