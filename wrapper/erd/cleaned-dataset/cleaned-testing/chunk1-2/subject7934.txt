How it works: You follow people and places, and they leave messages for you around the city. When you walk near one, you get an alert on your phone. Its like Twitter for your map, with, uh, alerts. Make sense?

Follow lots of people   places (so you can experience the alerts feature), then walk around the city. Weve got a couple of foodies in there, so try following them, or places like Great American Music Hall, Castro Theater, etc, which produce great alerts.
Were really curious to hear feedback. Thanks!

 You know how your dishrags and sponges get slimy after you've used them a while?  That's bacterial build up.  Sterilize them with a 1-2min spin in your microwave on high.  Time varies depending on how strong your microwave oven is, but as long as the sponge is quite hot to the touch and steaming, you've probably killed off ~99% of the nasties.  Enjoy cleaner, fresher smelling and less slimy dishrags. 





































































 More than half the time, it seems, the algorithm picks the wrong image.  Why not do it the way Facebook does, and allow us to cycle through the images of the page?   


















































































































 This is the just the most recent example: http://freakoutnation.com/2011/11/12/off-duty-cop-working-for-bank-of-america-pushes-protester-off-4-foot-wall/

What would have happened had a camera not fortuitously captured the truth?  Very possibly a completely innocent guy might have not only gone to jail (as he did), but also ended up with a record of assault - against a police officer.  Add to this that they regularly plant drugs to meet quotas.  Yet, in the absence of direct evidence, our judicial system treats their word as incontrovertible.  What will it take to change the presumption that  police are truthful? 




 Cut your lemon in half.  Stick a fork straight into the cut side.  As you're squeezing the lemon, rock the fork back and forth parallel to the line of tines.  This cuts into the flesh of the lemon and breaks it up, releasing more juice than just squeezing it alone.  






































































































































 Here is the interview with Colbert, if you haven't seen it already: http://gawker.com/5855105/stephen-colbert-trolls-occupy-wall-street "I'm a female-bodied person" and other choice quotes in this video.

OWS needs to stay on message and not veer off into weird gender issue language like this girl did.  This is exactly what killed the Left in the 80s.  Let's keep it practical and focused on the economic issues.

**EDIT**: Someone asked "WTF does killed  the left in the 80s refer to?"  

That was the era of Political Correctness - a term they themselves used. I was at Brown at the time. I became disgusted when some of these activists started posting signs on men's bathrooms informing them that "rape is not sex". I'm a guy and used to refer to myself as a feminist. They lost me at that moment. And then minority groups (I am one) started whining about their "subaltern identities". It was absurd, self-absorbed, divisive and just completely repellent to people who weren't crazed ideologues. Rush Limbaugh rose to fame complaining about this stuff. The rest is history.

 I've been a Redditor for almost 4 years, and have been amazed by how folks here were noticing each other in public, and getting together in real life.  I always thought it would be cool if we could secretly signal to each other.  This [website](http://blipboard.com) is pretty much the result.  It's been our dream to get redditors using it. 

It's mainly the work of 2 people, and we'd *love* to get your feedback.

**EDIT**: Note: IE is not working yet

**EDIT 2**: Thanks so much for the encouragement and feedback.  You're the first people outside of friends and family to use the site, so matches are going to be pretty thin right now, but keep trying.  There are definitely matches to be had in San Francisco, if you want to "fake it" - or, get a friend to check-in at or near the same location with the same tags.

 Indeed, Israel is far worse. 



















 eval-buffer is an EmacsLisp command. 









  a lot but half of our disappointment in Obama is that things cant get done in the rest of congress.

Lots of stuff he didn't do that he could have done: investigate war crimes, reign in the NSA, directed Holder to prosecute financial crimes instead of drug crimes and copyright "crimes"; he could have appointed someone other than a telecom industry exec to oversee the FCC (who is now predictably dismantling net neutrality) .  Those items, just off the top of my head, demonstrate that Obama is a conservative, like his hero Ronald Reagan.  Now, in terms of policy initiatives, he scuttled the hugely popular public option and universal care behind closed doors with industry execs, and implemented a complex Heritage institute plan that forces us all to be customers of the for-profit insurance industry.

 Hilary is more likely to get congress moving again and you know it

Hillary is more likely to serve monied interests.  That's all she's likely to do (and you know it). 




 Good luck on Hillary doing anything but servicing her lobbyists. 









 Exactly what was said about Obama. 




 Krugman called it: http://consultingbyrpm.com/blog/2009/12/krugman-did-identify-the-housing-bubble-in-2005.html 




 Python, Ruby, Node.js, Objective-C, now looking at Go.

No Haskell/ML ever, apart from casual perusing, I'm afraid. 









 Extensive public record, her research focus as a professor, and of course, major legislation she's sponsored and gotten passed.   




  Sadly, Warren is a two-issue candidate, with those issues being financial reform,  and being a woman who is not Hillary. 

That is just plain wrong.  She's been quite prominent on unions, domestic wiretapping, taxation, education loan reform, workplace safety, civil rights, bankruptcy, corporate power, and energy policy.  

 In 2008 we fielded a candidate with a formidable progressive brand and platform rather than a formidable progressive record.

Warren has an incredible record for her short tenure, unlike Obama. 

And Obama was not a progressive;  he even stated that publicly, saying that his ardent followers were attributing their politics to him incorrectly.  And he proved this in the primaries by supporting telecom immunity (against wiretapping charges) and Joe Lieberman over the progressive Ned Lamont, just to name a couple of issues.  Obama was at best a cypher if you weren't paying attention, but it was actually pretty obvious in the primaries that he was a conservative.  














 Seriously? 









 It's not "moderated down to a level" - it's been censored. 




 Oh dear.  Quite right.  (It's been about 5 years since I used CL.)  It should have been:

     (setf (gethash '= +query-operators+) #'equal-query-op)


*EDIT*: fixed 














 You don't replace mappings in the symbol table - you store mappings in a separate hash-table:

    (defconstant +query-operators+ (make-hash-table))
    (defun equal-query-op (var arg)
       (format nil "~a=~a" var arg))
    (defun not-equal-query-op (var arg)
       (format nil "~a~!=~a" var arg))
    (setf (gethash '= +query-operators+) #'equal-query-op)
    (setf (gethash '!= +query-operators+) #'not-equal-query-op)

Then, you just need a function that takes a list with a query operator as the first element and returns the parameter string:

    (defun query-param (qexp)
       (let ((op (first qexp))
             (op-args (rest qexp)))
          (apply (gethash op +query-operators+) op-args)))

And just map this method over the list:

    (mapcar #'query-param '((= first.name bob) (!= last.name jones)))

Which will yield a list of strings:

    ("first.name=bob" "last.name!=jones")

Which can be concatenated with FORMAT:

    (format nil "~{~a~^ ~}"
            (mapcar #'query-param '((= first.name bob) (!= last.name jones))))

Which gives:

    "first.name=bob last.name!=jones"
            
-----------------------
**EDIT**: fixed bugs (thanks, /u/spacebat) 




  just another downside of attaching healthcare to employment

Yup, Hobby Lobby showed us that. 




 How many different comparison operators do you have?  Is it just != and = or are there more?  

And "name.last!=jones" is valid but odd query syntax.  A typical web framework will pass a parameter named "name.last!" to the handler function.  So how are you going to encode other comparators?

The most straightforward and lispiest way is what someone else here suggested:

(query 'person '((= name.first bob) (!= name.last jones)))

Yes you will need to provide functions to do the conversion of lists into strings.  If you have a small number of operators, honestly an if or cond expression wouldn't be awful.   

Alternatively, you could keep a hash-table that maps the operator symbols (=, !=, etc) to parser functions.  The table would map the equal symbol to the = parser, etc.

Does that make sense? 














  Edit: Just for reference, [here](http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials-obama-care/120313-681526-cancer-patient-bill-elliott-audited-over-obamacare.htm ) is a story about an unitended effect of the ACA. It just makes me think that the people who supported the ACA didn't actually care enough the effects to do any prior research or put any more work into the bill to ensure this kind of thing didn't happen

Actually, the rightwing outlets reporting this are the ones that didn't do the research.  The story you're referencing is full of holes and untruths.  This has been a pretty common pattern for anti-Obamacare pieces reported on rightwing sites like the one you linked.

 Every time I try to play a video from MSNBC, I get a spinning peacock symbol but no video. 
























 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stone

 While the monetary system of Yap appears to use these giant stones as tokens, in fact it relies on an oral history of ownership. Being too large to move, buying an item with these stones is as easy as saying it no longer belongs to you. As long as the transaction is recorded in the oral history, it will now be owned by the person you passed it on tono physical movement of the stone is required.
 



















 I'm really puzzled by the hate for 47 Ronin.  It received a 13% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes (and was at 0% for top critics).  I really don't understand - it's not the greatest film, but it's certainly very far from the worst.  The visuals are gorgeous, and the script was reasonable - it certainly wasn't insulting like so many others that get much higher marks.  There weren't grating characters, the CGI was deployed tastefully and well done.  Overall it was a pretty fun romp. 























































































































 As far as I can tell, the Ether IPO hasn't started, but the AlethZero client allows you to mine ether.  Is this ether valid?

 The default orangered upvote count color provided by RES makes Reddit extremely difficult to parse.  The default upvote count draws the eyes away from the title at each line and toward the orangered highlight color at each line.

Compare here: http://imgur.com/a/CEJWX

Orangered is a strong color which Reddit uses to highlight and distinguish noteworthy elements:
   
   * user has upvoted an article
   * user has selected a tab (hot/new/etc)
   * user has new mail

Using orangered for # of upvotes adds a highlight on every line and creates a number of problems:
   
  * confuses the meaning of the highlight color
  * draws attention to a minor detail
  * reduces the readability of the site.  

I initially immediately uninstalled RES because of this particular feature.  I bet many other first-time users have had the same response.  It's worth an A/B test.    (I only kept RES this time after I discovered I could customize it to a neutral color.)

For my two cents, I think the upvote/downvote color should be the same gray color as other elements in that line (#888888), perhaps distinguishing up and downvotes using + and -.  E.g., (+100|-10).
