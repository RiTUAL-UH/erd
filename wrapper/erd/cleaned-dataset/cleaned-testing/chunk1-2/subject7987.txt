 Marine Systems Engineer here.  I'm just about to graduate from a 4 year curriculum at the US Merchant Marine Academy.  The program I've been a part of has introduced me to a wide range of engineering.  We start off learning the terminology used aboard ships and going over a core curriculum of calculus, physics, chemistry, electrical, and thermodynamics courses.  We spend an entire year as cadets on a number of ships in both a four month and eight month periods.  I was on four different ships during my sea time.  We then go over a number of advanced calculus, physics and electrical courses, we take classes in systems design, machine design, and, in the systems program we have a Capstone design project for which we go through the entire design process of designing systems for a vessel.   
























 Hah, figures someone beat me to this.  We considered using one of these in a marine engineering design project.  They are MASSIVE.
