 Betty Joe sounded like a good time  




 Hahahahaha your doom awaits you, John. 




 Tom tasted *divine* 




 That's actually a human corpse dead center  




 *meanwhile the caller robs you blind of every earthly possession you own* 




 I'm in love  




 Dude has a massive receding hairline. Maybe he thinks you work for Bosley 




 What the actual fuck 




 That's a beautiful song, honey. 




 Imagine her in bed. That's mad luxurious. 




 he looks weird. Like he has a spray tan and tons of botox. Seriously get a group of guy friends and confront him like you gotta a fucking problem?! And go from there. If he still keeps up I'd take it to the cops or take matters into my own hands. My two cents.
 









 Lemme guess he's Daryll for Halloween  




 reddit* 




 I'd hit it  




 I work with an organization called doctors without diplomas... 




 Legit as Fuck OP. Good shit. 




 Lol you're all like this is what my life is...coming up with Masters level thesis' on fictional stories on nosleep  




 Billy. Tasted. Divine. 




 Let's go have a drink with Alan Good time I bet he has some good stories to tell  




 what exactly do you do for a living? Damn I wish I had that kind of time  




 Frosted flakes nigga damn 




 I've never understood how people randomly get possessed by a demon. Did she summon it? Involved in the occult? If not, why did it chose her if it is a demon? Oujii board? Fuck idk  




 Hah I knew that would be the outcome before I read one line of this. Guess only people with cats could understand they're some weird little shits. Still love mine though. 




 Bet she had a great bush 




 I hope that was more than one bottle  




 Especially playing Goldeneye 




 Ok I can tell you for a fact you're either 1. Dead 2. Insane 3. In another dimension

A mass government evacuation isn't plausible without you hearing a whisper or seeing any signs of it. Awesome truck too btw  




 Shhhhh he can see you everywhere  




 The Cheshire Cat from Alice visited Willy Wonka 




 It's a portal straight to hell 




 Go steal an Xbox one and we''ll talk it out over some Destiny  




 Someone else said it but I'm just glad he's dead. Think about the sleepless nights you would've had if he got away...wear his shoes as a trophy  




 Loved you in BB! How was it working on the set of arguably one of the best shows to grace the screen?! And what can we look forward to on Better Call Saul? Any good cameos? More Huell? 




 Sounds like you're confused on your sexuality and are having some violent wet dreams! 




 Who should you be more afraid of? The govt or the aliens? 




 I'm extremely curious to try this..I have had trouble remembering parts of my childhood I wonder if this would reveal anything.. 




 Fuck you man! Nothing better than stuffed crust cheese Digiorno with Frank's and ranch...I put that shit on everything! 




 You're a beautiful snowflake. 




 C-L-A-I-R-E...I...W-A-N-T Y-O-U-R P-U-S-S-Y 




 You wouldn't believe what kinds of things I saw in people's bags. 




 Ok right before I left a "supervisor" got into a fight with another airport employee and cut him with a box cutter. I was working that day but didn't witness it, I was on break. 

http://m.wsbtv.com/news/news/tsa-agent-arrested-allegedly-cutting-worker-box-cu/ngCSF/

Employees were stealing passengers credit cards out of their checked bags and using them to buy things online. FBI got involved and conducted a sting operation. Yeah, bad time for all involved. 

Employees would routinely cuss out upper management..I'm talking management coma parable to RVPs/AVPs.


Employees got caught trying to transport cocaine through a secured area and onto planes. 


You get it I think...
 




 You're telling me! I fucking would die reading those. It was like the ideas and thought process of a 3rd grader. And everyone would belittle each other it was hilarious. Even the top rated ideas hardly ever got implemented.  




 Exactly. Look at what privatizing the prison system did.  




 They need to implement a fitness standard and arm competent individuals.  Like CBP.  




 *rolls over and see lady from Send Me To Hell* 




 I recently left TSA for a much better job. Have college degree and consider myself intelligent. They actually pay decent...I made $16 an hr. However, they have literally NO hiring standards besides a high school diploma. I remember talking to one of my supervisors who was actually competent and did interviews and he told me that in one of his interviews a guy told him his relevant experience was being a "hall monitor in middle school." No shit. Of course the supervisor politely told him he wasn't a good fit but management gave him shit for it and I think hired the guy anyway. Also, EVERYONE within is not satisfied. The level of incompetence extends to upper management. I have so many stories of things like this happening. They need to completely revamp this organization from the top down. Things like this will never stop. The good ole boys club was the method of promotion at the airport I worked as well. You would have guys making over 100k a year with no military/law enforcement experience trying to manage the biggest/busiest airport in the world. Sorry for being scatterbrained but /rant. 




 You can get a shotgun for $200 




 Just make sure you follow the code, Dex. 




 Haha 3  




 Contorting in all those positions seems to be a great workout! I bet you have a killer body, OP! 




 Ok so after hearing shit like that I would've never went back to sleep. My Mossberg would've taken the place of your crowbar. Not a happy ending for that guy  




 Call PETA/ASPCA 




 If he wasn't mentally ill, I would've gladly kicked his ass if I was you. Jk even if he was mentally ill too ;) 




 If you're a true Christian, and have accepted Jesus into your heart, then demons/evil spirits can't touch you i thought? Unless you're inviting them in via Ouija board..keep us updated OP I've been curious as to situations such as this.  




 What the actual fuck...looks like some real life Hills Have Eyes cousin-fucker bullshit. And donating dog food for admission? Da fuq  




 False imprisonment is what that would be called. Add on some assault and battery charges. Mayne Malicious Mischief, disorderly conduct, really whatever the fuck the cops wanted to charge them with. 




 Haha okay Dexter.. 




 From the sound of it, I'm sure you can handle yourself, OP. Raquel's friend sounds like a nerd. Well written as well, OP.  




 Saw this on Drugs Inc episode a while back. Makes you trip balls to the point of having a spiritual/enlightenment experience. Guy runs a camp that is devoted solely to therapy down in Chile? Can't remember country exactly  




 Kids *see* the darndest things! 




 This...

http://youtu.be/G7RgN9ijwE4 




 Such beauty and mystery all in one picture.  




 That sounds like a horrible daily routine. No idea what that could be.  




 Fuck that. I can take ghost stories any day but anything with the occult/pentagrams/Satan scares the shit out of me. Id have to be heavily intoxicated/armed to go in that bitch. 




 Actually I stay on no sleep and whatever's on the front page. I'm sure it's good though I was only thinking via writing. Hah. I read one about that wasn't my husband I slept with last night and that took half the day at work lolol winning
 




 As opposed to the Xbox One which is 8 




 I'm sure this is decent but reading 12 updates to catch up?! Meh.. 




 Waiting outside a movie theater? That's low. Bitch I hope the fuck he do! He's be a dead son of a bitch I can tell ya that 




 Not as creepy as I expected but still weird. I think seeing him the first time driving by scared me more  




 Buried alive but left you with a cell phone?  




 Plot twist or annoying double post? You decide.. 




 My point exactly... 




 One of the first believable stories on no sleep 




 But who exactly wrote "help" is the real question. #plottwist #redherring 




 Thanks for sharing and sorry for all you've been through. Try to pick up the pieces and find meaning in your life. Positivity and good vibes for you my friend. 




 Go back go back go back! I bet you won't! 




 *yawns* 




 That is so bizarre I've never read of a spirit causing hair loss. I think it's definitely a good idea to get a priest/pastor involved. Your wife is probably confused and doesn't know that she's dead or hasn't come to grips with it. Get Michelle blessed and seek medical attention. And tell her to stay far away. Good luck look forward to the next update. 




 Weirdest post I've read on reddit thus far. Da fuq..all my experiences with acid never teleported me through time and space.  




 Whatever is inhabiting your brothers body is probably a lot smarter and stronger than you, seeing as he knocked you down without even realizing it. 'It' is probably already doing the same, plotting how to kill you or stage your death. Be careful! 




 Gotta love dogs :) 




 Dammit, Casper! 




 Ryan started the fire! 




 Why does your hand insist on being so violent?  




 Damn. Kid or not I would've absolutely destroyed that kid. Guarantee you he gets out at 18. The CJ system is ass-backwards. Sorry, OP. :( 




 True. She admits to psychological issues as well which probably played a huge part in it. Anyway, hope you get the help you need OP and figure out what's going on! Best wishes. 




 Morphine induces auditory and visual hallucinations in some cases. I've seen it first hand. My grandpa was in the hospital and on a Morphine drip...he was pretty comical. He saw monkeys in the ceiling and other obviously medically induced hallucinations. No worries. 




 Sewing set? Do you drink cranberry juice while you sew as well? Pussy 




 These are awesome! 




 Ok the fact that you admitted to previous psychiatric care makes this story void. Sounds like paranoid delusions and/or hallucinations. It seems extremely unlikely that someone would go to that great a length to stalk a call center manager.  Also, I feel like this is a plot from a movie..., 




 So a couple nights ago I experienced what I think was sleep paralysis for the first time in my life (I'm 26). It was the most terrifying yet interesting experience I've had in my entire life. Basically, I went to sleep that night and woke up in the middle but I was paralyzed. I had an overwhelming fear take over my whole body as if someone or something was in the room with me. I read up on it and basically my mind was awake but my body was still "asleep". It gives me the chills thinking back on it. It lasted maybe ten seconds then I was woke up woke up and was able to move and function normally. Anyone else experienced this? Idk what could have triggered it as I have no family history of this and as I said I've never experienced it in 26 years. So random to happen now.  
























 Bobo the clown went hard as fuck last night! 




 Orly? 




 Agree to disagree 




 Great tits though  




 *coke sold separately* 




 Fucking boost mobile  




 Waiiiiit a sec I'm pretty sure you can't receive blocked text messages.... 




 This is simply a picture representing the horrors of childhood obesity.  




 Seriously fuck SeaWorld. I was all whatevs until the bit where they took the young away from her mother and they all just hung around and circled around the boat during the whole process.

 That's not what your mom said last night! 




 It was such a long drop you couldn't see the shit and piss flying everywhere. 




 I'd start pulling the candy canes off and eating them if he wore that to a party  




 I was a specialist thru basic then commissioned back in March :D 




 His username is moist_damp_panties hahaha  




 Your daughter loves anal! 




 There's a soldier in my unit that's been a specialist for 5 years  




 I make a similar face  




 Hey is that...wait...over the...that way...what  




 Trust me its not  




 Thanks!

Our motto is one bust that's all  




 Cept' I'm Merican motha fucka! 




 "The floor is lava! That's the lava game, when you pretend that the floor is lava and you climb up on all the furniture. I see some of you don't get that. I don't care, that's okay. You might have called it something else, but it meant the same thing; you were poor. I'd tell my mom, "I want a Nintendo." and she'd reply "The floor is lava!" "What's wrong with our house? Why can't we afford better carpeting? It's called two jobs, bitch!" That's how I used to talk. I was very street" -Daniel Tosh  




 Can you imagine dropping and watching this video in its entirety? 




 They upgraded tv's and downgraded carpet from 50 years from the first 50 years  




 Yeah no way the stream is that powerful  




 You're a wizard Harry!

 *changed your life 




 I'm not in sales nor do I ever want to be but I've always wanted to use that reference. Upvoted sir! 




 What's this palimas.com site? 

*clicks*

Fapping ensues. 




 They're so eloquent with their words.  




 You're the guy that's late to the party and just got the joke...right? 




 Suck a fuck? 




 This is relevant but having a really small penis but great girth. 




 Top of the morning to ya! 




 My pastor says read  




 My pastor says that special  




 I won the Pennsylvania lottery back in 1983 

My family quit Our jobs and we lived frugally 

Our lawyer took 1/4 of the $2,600 but he still remains a family friend to this day..

....?!?!?! $2,600 I'm assuming that's a typo 


It could have been $3,000 but we wanted the money up front  




 "Our pastor says that UFOs are proof"

"Proof that what?"

"That God"

That got me haha  




 What's long and hard and full of seamen? 




 Thanks Patriot Act!  




 His name is junkyard Willie and he'll sell you hubcaps 




 The open the capsule and it's a nude portrait of Paul Revere. Well played sir.. 




 THATS the body of a 14 year old? I call bs 




 Looks like a cute minotaur! 




 When did they start serving nightmares at McDonalds with a side of childhood obesity? 




 Demonic possession now available at Red box!  




 Would you fuck me?....I'd fuck me.. 




 It's.....it's.....the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.... 









 As Dave Chappelle would say ..."the racism is killing me inside!"

 Damn the woman holding snoopy looks like a total babe...well legs at least  




 Sir yelling isn't going to hel..

FUCK YOU! 

Lulz my fav part  




 "For a dollar you can lick this!"

That's what I imagine her saying at least  




 Nah OP is just really drunk  




 Just fake hangs himself in front of thousands of pre-teens lmfao  




 You're "special" brother Daniel ;) 




 Hey Brother Daniel, you're a big p*ssy boy!  




 Guy just kept cleaning and didn't even care that the guy drove off lol like you Think any normal person would be like "hey sir I'm back here!"  




 I wonder how painful it would be to get that filled in with ink. Think about the stories you could tell...
"Cool tat bro where'd you get that idea?..

"Oh that's where I got struck by lightning back in '99"
...__ 




 Ah Fuck me in the goat ass 




 he says "sex time!". I said fine but only if he took off his knife hands

This had me fucking dying. 




 I've got the weirdest boner right now  




 Not a terrible movie, actually pretty comical at times. Not purposefully, either. 




 Who's the blonde? 









 Dex! Which season did you enjoy filming most? Least? 

In my opinion season 4 was the best. 

...now bring me one of those donuts! 




 Your girlfriend pulled a fast one on ya with the most elaborate setup yet. She "faked" sick   clued in one of her friends to your little game. She even planned it to the extent of when it would be storming and also pretended to be asleep. All the while snickering behind the door while you look for her and talk to yourself.  




 Is this a depiction of Noah and the Ark? 




 Cocaine is a helluva drug! 




 Exactly what the Fuck is this supposed to be? Dude cannot drive for shit either  




 Yeah I'm sure this one is similar to the brick above in regards to the screams. The officer truly was pleading for his life. And screaming after being shot multiple times. The sounds he makes in his final breaths are disturbing too, don't watch it. 




 Great parenting right here! World needs more selfless men and women like this. Well in this case girl :)  




 Slice of Life 




 That'd be perfect because if I raged I could just throw all my shit right in the river  




 He's all like "sup, bro?...don't mind me." 




 Love how the one chick responds with "why thank you!" Haha no shame  














 Yeah it's so sad. Such a storied franchise tarnished by such incompetence. It pisses me off more that they haven't come out with any statement since. Just tell us what's going on. Quit saying thanks for your continued patience. Nobody's been patient. You got the benefit of the doubt but two weeks later and nothings fixed.  




 Wait so someone escaped the cradle? Through your floor and out your door?!? Please update, OP! And a gun is useless unloaded btw  














 Wear pooka shell necklaces and Abercrombie clothes. And frosted tips. Nobody does that anymore unless you're Guy Fieri 




 Almost 24 hrs later and no fixes. Lol ok 3v4v3 









 I bet the woman just wants the D 




 Still looking for Alan/Steve 




 This is instantly what I thought of:
