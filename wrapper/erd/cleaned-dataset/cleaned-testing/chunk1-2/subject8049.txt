 TIL Conan O'Brien went to Harvard. 




 ...and it crashes in the ocean near a remote island. The man and Brooklyn Decker swim to shore and are the only survivors. They immediately find food and build shelter. With nothing else to do, they begin having sex.

They are having sex multiple times a day for over two weeks, until one day Brooklyn finds the man standing on the beach alone. She approaches him and asks "What's wrong? Is it me? Is it the sex?" The man replies, "No, it's not you and the sex is great... It's just, well... Do you mind if I do something?" Brooklyn replies, "No, whatever you want, I just want you to be happy."

The man then takes off his hat and puts it on Brooklyn's head, tucking her hair up into it. Then he rubs mud on her face in the shape of a beard and says...

"DUDE! I HAVE BEEN HAVING SEX WITH BROOKLYN DECKER FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS!" 




 Also came to say this:  Check out McCauley's side project, Middle Brother, with Taylor Goldsmith (Dawes) and Matt Vasquez (Delta Spirit). 




 I FUCKING love Deer Tick... McCauley is one of my favorite singer-songwriters!  For anyone digging this song, please check out their 2nd album, The Black Dirt Sessions, super moody! 




 This is in no way structurally similar to "Carolina Drama"... the song never reaches a climax of head-banging proportions like "Little Black Submarines".  And just for the record, neither The White Stripes nor The Black Keys were on the radar when they were putting out their early albums.

EDIT: I am referring to the mainstream radar, by the way. 














 Yeah, I agree. Eminem just did a song on the Marshall Mathers LP2 that samples it too.

 Check out Rhythm Devils... a Bill and Mickey side-project... I think Mike Gordon (Phish) and Steve Kimock (Zero, SKB) play with them.

A Plan for the Improvement of English Spelling

by Mark Twain

For example, in Year 1 that useless letter "c" would be dropped to be replased either by "k" or "s," and likewise "x" would no longer be part of the alphabet. The only kase in which "c" would be retained would be the "ch" formation, which will be dealt with later. Year 2 might reform "w" spelling, so that "which" and "one" would take the same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well abolish "y" replasing it with "i" and Iear 4 might fiks the "g/j" anomali wonse and for all.

Jenerally, then, the improvement would kontinue iear bai iear with Iear 5 doing awai with useless double konsonants, and Iears 6-12 or so modifaiing vowlz and the rimeining voist and unvoist konsonants. Bai Iear 15 or sou, it wud fainali bi posibl tu meik ius ov thi ridandant letez "c," "y" and "x"--bai now jast a memori in the maindz ov ould doderez--tu riplais "ch," "sh," and "th" rispektivli.

Fainali, xen, aafte sam 20 iers ov orxogrefkl riform, wi wud hev a lojikl, kohirnt speling in ius xrewawt xe Ingliy-spiking werld.

I can hear sound and barely see an image if I hold screen at an angle. Can it be repaired cheaply and easily?

Also (sorry).... What is this? Can I connect the Game Gear to my TV or monitor?

 Ok, so about 7 years ago, I was working out pretty hard and supplementing Creatine. I was taking the capsules, which you are supposed to swallow with a LARGE glass of water. Well, one morning I was running late for work, after the gym, and I throw the capsules in my mouth and swallow them at the water fountain. About a mile down the road my throat starts drying up severely and then I cough... POOF... Creatine powder everywhere and it tastes like shit so I start gagging until I pull over, open the door, and puke...and puke...and puke. The Creatine powder coated my throat so bad I couldn't stop gagging.

Also, I took my glasses off in the process of puking and set them on my seat... I sat on them and broke them when I got back into the car.

TL;DR Creatine and then sat on my glasses, breaking them.
