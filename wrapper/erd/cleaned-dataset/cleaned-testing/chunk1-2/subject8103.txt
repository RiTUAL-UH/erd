 You didn't specify what type of order you're making.  You can't really make an order like you described.  The closest thing would be a limit order, in which case as soon as the order is submitted, it is executed at the current bid price (essentially converted to a market order), since the current price is above your limit price.  There's no scenario I know of in which what you proposed would have any impact on the stock's price, from a pure price point of view.  

That said, if you have a large amount of stock that you unload, that volume alone might will usually have an impact on the stock's price.  That's why it's important to watch institutional investors, since they generally invest much larger sums of money into equities.  So, for example, when they start buying $FB because it recently got added to the S P, you can expect to see a positive impact on the price. 




 Investing is like cooking...every chef has a different style.  
Start slow and develop a sense of your risk tolerance.  
Knowledge is power...start reading the internet voraciously about anything and everything related potential investments.  You might think you know tech sector, but understanding how a stock is traded (the "technicals") is not the same thing as a company's fundamentals.
