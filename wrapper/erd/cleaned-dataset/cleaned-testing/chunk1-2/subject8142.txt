 That's why I'd want to be a longsnapper. 




 And of course the flattery of calling her a 7. 




 I've had 3 or 4 professors show that in management classes. 




 In fairness, I'm not sure Weis would still be here even if he'd gotten continued #1 classes. Now assuming Weis still gets fired, we might have won 1 or 2. 




 Dollar drink night? 




 I won $400 in amazon gift cards for winning a GameFAQs contest. 




 [I found two guys for her.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPy1D-bsFDE) 




 This guy is way more excited than he should be for a lot of things. Learn a new description. Almost as much as he says artsy fartsy. 




 Plus there's the prospect of not going to the compass bowl this year. 




 Reminds me of Paul Finch from American Pie. 




 Nothing sets the mood like fucking in a cemetery. 




 Sergio Brown. Was surprised to see him get to the NFL at all, and now he's played 3 years and doesn't seem to be going away. He was bad on a terrible defense while he was here. Couldn't tackle at all. Or cover anyone. 




 I read yepp in the voice of Dave Hester from storage wars. 




 I like that he felt he needed to have hahas all the way to the 140 character limit. 




 Doesn't everyone play for the national championship game for at least the first week? You're at least playing for it until you lose. 




 You've clearly never been to youtube. 




 Aside from all the incredibly uncomfortable adjectives, the names should really be reversed so they line up with whose name it is. Unless it's a girl named Ross and a boy named Hannah. 




 At our campus gym over the summer, a lot of local high school football players would come in. A few of them would come in and sit at the bicep machine for 30 minutes, doing one of the lowest weights you could do, and then leave. Gotta get big. 




 People get excited to go to Alabama for the academics? 




 I have a friend who always makes the same face in pictures when he's drunk. We made an album of all 100 or so pictures he's done it in. 




 It's like when someone selling cars goes into the back to talk to their manager. Trying to negotiate and telling you what an opportunity you'd be missing. 




 It was my first question when he said he was a professional gambler. 




 It's called bargaining. 




 I like to imagine this is a form letter where you can circle which ones you'd like him to be. 




 When all else fails, compare the girl you're trying to impress to a man.

*~t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m~* 




 Obviously you want one of those two options. 




 There's always a few kickers or punters every once in a while that played rugby or soccer. That's usually about it. 




 Hell we had 4 years in a row in the 80s where a QB from ND named Joe was starting in the Super Bowl. 




 Ringo's the Beatle of choice? 




 Yeah definitely the Stanford game. Even the rain just made it so much more exciting. Was just a ridiculous game. Granted my memories of it are pretty hazy, though. Gameday was fun as hell, too. And since we'd already beaten Michigan earlier, it was the last team I needed us to beat to not go 0-4 against anyone while I was here. 




 When I was in 1st grade I wanted to be a paleontologist but my teacher couldn't spell it so when we drew pictures of what we wanted to be I had to be an astronaut. 




 Time to take his talents to South Beach. 




 The amount of people I see wearing shit like jeans and sweaters and polos is ridiculous. And not even just lifting which is bad enough, but doing cardio like the stationary bike and elliptical. That's gotta be either really uncomfortable, or you're not working out hard enough to do anything. 




 Easily my favorite part. 




 Somebody took introductory psych and polisci. 




 The ESPN commercial wasn't lying! They really do say Roll Tide randomly and in awkward situations! 




 There's also the fact that you only graduate about half your players. And it's even worse if you're black. If you're just trying to go somewhere with good academics, why not go somewhere that's going to make sure you graduate? Schools like Notre Dame, Northwestern, Stanford, Rice and Duke all graduate over 85% of players. Hell Notre Dame actually graduates a higher percentage of black players than white. 




 And part of the only brother sister anchor team in America! Or something like that. 




 He didn't get fired but somebody posted a picture of his dress code at Epic. I showed it to a friend of mine who works there and she told me he'd get in trouble for it. A week later she texted me saying the guy got called out at a staff meeting or something. 




 Wow at that 2007 class of QBs. That's one hell of a deep class. 




 And then Bruce Almighty for whatever reason decided to do a real number for the theatrical release.  




 At least they won. 




 Those are Michigan fans complaining. We're the ones that dropped the series. And we dropped it to play games with the ACC. 




 Maybe I'm missing something, but what does Sandlot have to do with Notre Dame? Or did you just digress into sports movies from 1993 you don't like? 




 A guy in my dorm freshman year was named James Crowe. Never went by Jim. 




 I lived across the street with a family whose son was named Gehrig. Their other son was Nolan. Middle name Ryan. 




 1, 2, and 4. I went there, my dad went there, and I lived in South Bend until I was 14. 




 Shocker: sports stories get romanticized over the years! 




 Who gets excited for tax day? Unless you're an accountant who's excited to get a little bit of a break. 









 I have a friend who until she was 20 didn't realize you could have sex during the day. Someone made a joke about daytime sex or something and she looks at us all wide eyed and asks "Really?" Apparently she'd somehow managed to skip sex ed when she switched schools in high school. This was coupled with the fact that we can't have anyone of the opposite sex in our dorms between midnight and 9 on weeknights and 2 and 9 on weekends. She assumed it was to stop people from fucking, which is also technically against our rules. That defines sheltered. 




 Hell I go to Notre Dame and even all our science professors believe in evolution. 




 USC: Their weather. Right now at least. 




 Personally I think one should be the N, M, and Iowa division, and the other one can just be the other division. 




 If they changed their mascot to that it would make me so happy. 




 I've got a few.

My freshman roommate tried to give the head nod to Jimmy Clausen. Clausen shook his head at him.

Was in a seminar with our punter, Ben Turk. On several occasions the professor just called him punter. His text message noise was also "Where the white women at?" from Blazing saddles.

Used to play basketball with some of the football players at the gym. As the biggest guy in our group who played some center in middle school, I always got stuck guarding the linemen. The worst was Kapron Lewis-Moore. Dude had over 100 pounds and about 3 inches in height on me. I've never had to box out harder in my life.

My favorite story is of a friend of mine though. She's from Spain, so she doesn't really follow football, even as a Notre Dame student. But she was in a fairly small major, and Eric Olsen, our center, was also in that major. She was leaving class with him one day when they run into one of Olsen's friends. He tells her it's his friend Mike. She asks if he's on the football team, and he says yes. Then she asks what position he plays. Dude just looks at Olsen and asks if she's for real. Olsen has to apologize and say she's from Spain. Mike was Michael Floyd. 




 I was pretty convinced it would be him. Doubtful now though. Maybe in his honor we can have a blank cover. 




 Ironic because all of Holy Cross in Rudy is from Notre Dame. 




 Different girl, not Alex either. 




 And everyone know Frankie's is the best BBQ in town anyway. 




 I know a guy named James Crowe. He doesn't go by Jim. 




 The chem one is false, but the others are true.  




 He was dating someone before, too. Different girl. 




 I think it's hilarious. I've been waiting for something to come out because I knew he wasn't actually dating her. He was dating someone else at the time. He even just called her a friend early on I believe. This probably led to less shock when it all came out. Though I'd never have guessed she didn't exist. I'm pretty sure he was in on it to some degree due to rumblings I've heard, but to what I'm not sure.

As for ND fans in general, the student body seems to be pretty skeptical of him, the rest of the fan base who doesn't know him as well is pretty much buying his story entirely. 

 




 Yeah Tyler Eifert is in a one credit class right now because he's already graduated from what I've heard. 




 I always thought it was funny when I'd see someone go in to a PG-13 movie by themselves and pay the 12 year old price. 




 My guess is it had more to do with the buyout. I think once Purdue's or Michigan State's become a little more manageable we'll probably replace one of them for Michigan. 




 Ours are actually fairly smart for the most part. We had a guy a few years ago who was the first player ever I believe to be in law school while playing. 




 They weren't from players. They were from some other kid who I assume was in his dorm. 




 The Lennay Kekua Car Crash Cancer Foundation. 




 Once it had happened, I thought they handled the Declan case well. My bigger issue is it never should have happened.

For Lizzy Seeberg, obviously what happened to her is terrible. However, non-rape sexual assaults are incredibly difficult to prosecute. It all comes down to he said she said. In this case, there were inconsistencies between even what she said versus her friends. This all makes it really difficult to do anything about. I'l agree that the non-athlete friend was a complete dumbass and should have been punished for what he did assuming they could get a consensus he did it. 




 Sadly no, that's Stanford. We just have people who will date imaginary girls rather than someone actually at the school. 




 There basically hasn't been any point recently where he hasn't been with someone that was real and went here or SMC. It was what confused the shit out of me when the whole thing started in September. 




 What a coincidence. My dorm is right by a grassy knoll. 




 On the bright side it improved your chances at the Fullmer Cup. 




 Hell I think it's hilarious. I've been waiting for something to come out about this whole thing for months. I knew he wasn't actually dating her, never would have guessed she wasn't a person. 




 But does his girlfriend exist? 




 Made by Apple. 




 I've also been told there was a girl who broke up with him in September when this all came out because he told her he'd made it all up. 




 I can confirm this. He was dating someone in september too. 




 Token ND student here. That never was a question because he was hitting on girls. He was dating someone when the story came out from everything I've heard. We all thought the original story was weird. 




 I have those same Hulk hands. 




 As soon as the divisions came out all ESPN could talk about was N M and Iowa. I then remember that this is the Legends division because Michigan isn't in leaders even though it's in their fight song. 




 Or he wants everyone to know he had a girlfriend at one point.  




 I learned from the Scooby Doo movie that if you eat too many peppers and you don't have  anything to drink ketchup can cool down your tongue. 




 We tried to do this this year to let Manti play in Hawaii at the end of the year. Couldn't make it work. 




 That or:
Kelly: So I'm really excited to be moving up to the NFL with the Eagles.

Eagles: Yeah we're not so interested in you after all.

Kelly: Shit, better go back to ND. 




 So who's not irrelevant? LSU lost Saban to the NFL. USC lost Carroll. Stanford lost both Harbaugh to the NFL and Willingham to ND (They could have kept him). So unless we're arguing that Alabama is the only relevant school, then I'm not sure what makes this any different. 




 Twist: He does the press conference in ladies' underwear. 




 Davie had a much better resume than Diaco does at this point. Plus he'd actually been interim head coach for a game where we blew out Vandy I believe. 




 Notre Dame actually lives its boat shoes. 




 Please no more assaulting police officers. 




 I honestly don't think I've ever seen a worse recruiter than Ty Willingham. 




 Also Urban Meyer and Nick Saban because they're both definitely interested. 




 No, nothing should be done to limit what Lane does or USC. He should be in charge of as much as possible there. 




 I fully support this. 




 I don't mind it as much in the acronym. I think actually saying The Ohio State University is kind of obnoxious, yes, but in the acronym it at least makes it less confusing considering how many OSUs there are. 




 In fairness, that was the year where the upperclassmen were from the classes where Ty hadn't recruited oline at all. 





























 Lyk dis if u cry evertim 




 Where are you that there's this much snow? Because there as hell doesn't seem to be that much anywhere else in Indiana. 




 So then who's the Tecmo Super Bo? 




 Fortunately we figured that out this year. 




 JUCO transfers like Aaron Rodgers I'd be ok with us taking. I don't want us taking guys who had trouble qualifying academically, but if it was a skill thing I don't see a reason we couldn't, or at least have 1 exception a year for it or something. 




 AXE Body Spray: Because who doesn't want to smell like a middle school locker room? 




 I won't miss his ability to somehow make our DBs forget how to cover. 




 Same idea but with icy hot. 




 Yeah I got eliminated from valedictorian my first semester of high school when I took electives. The salutatorian was 2nd because he accidentally took an extra art class freshman year. 




 I wish this was the first thread where I'd read about someone sticking their dick in milk today. 




 He did Parks and Rec instead. 




 Terrifying. 




 They said learned how to dress. 




 Every time I see a picture of Shaun White I think why is someone talking about Carrot Top? 




 Yeah I'm at Notre Dame and our highest paid employee is our investment officer. And he's still only making a fraction of what he'd make in the private sector. 




 I have full faith in us being the first 1 seed to lose in the first round if we ever get seeded that highly. 




 Your mistake for having faith in us to win. 




 I thought everyone thought that. 




 We finally found the one person who would hit the share button when watching porn. 




 My marketing class was basically teaching us how to do market research and what you needed to know. I.e. how to figure out where to sell, who to target, what types of products will be successful, etc. 




 Best: Notre Dame beating Stanford this year.

Worst: Losing to Boston College in 2002 or the Bartman play. 




 Seeley Booth vs. Angel.

On the other side of the spectrum, Miachel Cera as George Michael and Evan would be pretty even, too. 




 Lynyrd Skynyrd, Public Enemy, and Lady Gaga. 




 Buffy taught me no. 




 I work at my campus dining hall. This kid got fired while making personal pizzas for people for insulting students, throwing knives, and using the word "nigdick", his own invention. After he graduated, this wonderful human being enrolled in seminary, but then I ran into him at a bar later and learned he dropped out because "celibacy sucks". He is one of 2 people to have fired in probably the last 6 or 7 years, the other being a student manager who gave out tequila shots to students in the basement. Another was almost fired for dealing to full time staff, but he got arrested first. 




 Doubly so for /r/funny. 




 We had a presentation from a guy that does innovation for a beer company. The one time I didn't want to see a presentation on beer. 




 But Scotty doesn't know. 




 He went to IU though. 




 I had an RA that used to do this. 




 Click. That shit was supposed to be Adam Sandler playing with time and kicking people in the balls.  




 The Ivy League is all private. 




 Ring by Spring. 




 "Memories" 




 Should have masturbated more. We talk about prostate cancer plenty. 









 The fact that the B1G is all state schools except Northwestern doesn't help either. That has the potential of being on the wrong side of a lot of votes. 




 No parents no rules! 




 And so stylish. 




 I think now it's grad students that start it and goes to seniors. No more grad students splitting sophomores and juniors. 




 I hope it was [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxq-aOiGmQU). 




 The shower's in the toilet! That's amazing! 




 Debt can even be good if you can invest the money toward something with a higher rate than the interest you're paying. If I'm paying say 4% interest on my house and I have extra money after monthly payments, I could use that money to pay off extra money on my mortgage. However, given that the market tends to average somewhere between 8 and 12% in a year that's not a crash, you're usually better off investing that money elsewhere. 




 I had this same thing happen with my ex. 




 The only one I remember was someone bought condoms and a drug test. She paid all in singles. 




 This happens to me all the time Not having Friday classes really fucks with my head. 




 It make you look like Dwight. 




 Freitag just felt wrong though. There needs to be a Yeagley coaching there forever. 




 That's a cheap wedding. 




 Next: Beer 30! 




 Beer 30 has my favorite can ever though. 




 I took it as part of a job application. It was really easy. 




 Hamm's 




 Maybe LSU is just more willing to rise above it.

In all honesty it's most likely because of the way it was phrased. If they mentioned LSU doing it, too, Louisiana probably would have been ok with it. 




 I don't think anyone underrated Samardzija when he was here. Everyone knew he was awesome. I'd go with Jimmy personally. He had a great year for us his junior year, but had an awful o-line and a defense that didn't tackle, they just pushed. Was he an asshole? Yes. But a damn good player. 




 I've been really impressed with Wilson. I think he's going to lead you guys to a level that you haven't reached since Mallory. Also the win for Hoep in 2007 was just awesome. Considering how bad 2007 was for ND, IU at least gave me something to be happy about. 




 Fucking Gary Gray and Fucking Tommy Rees. 




 I don't think I've ever had a minimum time for presentations. Questions counting for time would screw me over every time because it'd end up pushing my presentations over the time limit. 




 Shit I just assumed that's what those were. 




 My nightmares of ND football all involve Tommy. 




 That has nothing to do with snow and everything to do with it being 465. That's awful driving no matter what time of year. 




 Hell yeah Chilly Willies. 




 What part of Indiana is this? Every part I've been in has been fine driving with snow. 




 Tell that to an accounting firm. 




 I'll agree with you on that first one. We have an assload of bandwagon fans. That's pretty much what leads to all of those other 3. We get preferential treatment because we have a lot of fans so our games = ratings and people will go to them as well. It's that combined with the fact that we have a fair amount of wealthy alumni, so they'll pay to go. 3 comes mostly from the bandwagon fans. Most alumni and students have the most pessimistic views of ND. As for 4, there's no reason for us to join financially so why should we? That comes from the first 2. 




 The Big Ten is an awful idea. I'd completely prefer the ACC. The ACC has schools that are way more similar to us, such as Duke, BC, Wake, Miami, and Syracuse. In the Big Ten we'd have Northwestern. I don't want to be one of the only 2 private schools in our conference. Conference affiliation need to be about more than athletics. Only reason I'd prefer the Big Ten would be to join the Committee on Institutional Cooperation. Still don't want to join one though. 




 He threw a really pretty ball by his junior year, too. I don't think he gets enough credit for how good he was his last year because he spent 3 years with a defense that didn't know how to tackle. 




 If it's in the game, it's in the game. 




 It won't be 600. It'll be 599 US Dollars. 




 I felt like in this scenario it was the equivalent of shouting while someone is talking and saying I can't hear you.

"Please stop writing to me"

"I can't understand a word you're saying" 




 We had a 3 week debate 2 years ago about them. Started by a guy who was against them. 




 He didn't end up taking it I think. I think that was before he came back for another year to get enough credits for the CPA exam. 




 That engineering wasn't for me. Almost failed out of school before I realized it. Made the switch to business and I've enjoyed it so much more and done way better. 




 I used to live in Bloomington, so IU apparel was huge there. I worked at a Kmart, and there was one month we got a huge shipment of Oklahoma gear. I'm pretty sure someone fucked up because of the similar logos. Needless to say they didn't sell very well. 




 A friend of mine took a year off from college because he had cancer. At an interview the interviewer said "I notice you took a year off from college. Were you spending a year finding yourself?" in kind of a smarmy tone. He of course replied no, he was fighting cancer. He got an offer. 




 My roommate did this for a summer and only sold one thing. But he referred a guy who got really into it and so he made a bunch from that. 




 Fucking magnets, how do they work? 




 But that means you're missing Pigtostal! 




 We've got a couple of those. 




 It's not that we're too good to join a conference, it's that there's no reason for us to. We're not going to join one for the sake of joining one. 




 We've won national championships in women's soccer, fencing, and women's basketball recently, and are competing in each of those every year. We're also really strong in men's soccer, men's lacrosse, and men's hockey, and have a good but not great men's basketball program. I think our tennis teams are usually pretty good, too. Women's lacrosse has also been good in the last few years. Our rugby team was good until they got disbanded for selling the vans they rented to go on a trip in the 90s to buy alcohol and drugs, but it's back and doing alright. 




 Except in 1989. 




 This is why I don't want us to join the Big Ten. No desire to be on the wrong end of a bunch of 2-whatever votes. 




 It shouldn't take Mad Men for you to realize this. 




 I think I'd take another year of Eifert over Rudolph honestly. It'd be pretty close. I also think we're weaker at WR next year than TE so I'd probably go with Golden. Plus Golden was just awesome. 




 Mendoza! 




 And as Amy Poehler once said, BC is the Harvard of Boston. 




 Someone never read [The Official Pokemon Handbook](http://i.imgur.com/YOkOqpo.jpg) as a kid. 




 But whips and chains excite her. 




 For Love of the Game as well. Awful book, great movie. To a lesser extent, Field of Dreams also. 




 Always glad to help. 




 Seems like you would have had trouble typing that then.

 ND-USC has been much more consistent as a rivalry than ND-Michigan though. We've been playing playing USC almost every year since the 20s. Michigan has been off and on. 




 All girls are suckers for that neckbeard. 




 Quick! Someone call Kevin Bacon! 




 Would have been better if she'd said wicked smart. 




 I'd never have believed it if he hadn't assured me it was true. 




 No that's just katy. 




 And that's why you always leave a note.
