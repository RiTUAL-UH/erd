 Deadly Premonition 2: The Deadcoming 




 Japanese Hard Dance is so under exposed (which is sad because it's an awesome scene!) and for anyone interested in speedcore check out M1dy

Edit: also if your interested in hardcore checkout Kobaryo, his song clock control is great 




 Awhile ago I really didn't like speedcore... Now I like it, anyways RWC dose some good stuff and I would recommend checking out some of his terrorcore   extra tone if your feeling crazy :' ) and if your not feeling crazy don't worry he also dose hardstyle under the name shingo DJ 




 I'm a little sad this release isn't hard dance but I am sooo happy Mat's back! 




 [Me still in my PJ's on a Sunday](http://imgur.com/DqzWC19) 




 Hardcore for life 




 Get this song for free from the DL's in the description then play dark souls so you can engage in jolly cooperation while you listen! 









 Get this song for free form the DL's in the discription and then play dark souls so you can engage in jolly cooperation while you listen!  




 Baebii :D 




 Ohh... Maby A fine romance by frank or some where beond the sea by Bobby Darin  




 The sad thing is this could actually be a thing that you would see pop up on your news feed 




 I totally forgot about gammer! Also I've never heard that song before so thanks! 




 Oh sweet!, I thought it was that guy he killed... 




 I'm a huge gabber/hardstyle/hard trance head and I've been getting into happy hardcore lately so please give me some suggestions! The only people I know of right now are Rhythmics, Nanobii, S3rl   Matduke 




 What's woolie supost to be? 




 Some one please make a video where all the pics are of woolie/grandma swamp 




 Dude I know, I was reading it and the whole time I was like ":(" the I saw the familiar vegtiable at the end of the article  




 Look closer at the website... 














 He responded to my message on FB and said that it might be hard for him to do because he doesn't really have a method. I for one would love to see how he made the kick from sounds of the machine if he dose decide to make one  














 Just think about it, hiding from lickers in lockers, running away from 2 hunters instead of the twins and of course nemesis would replace walker  
























 Recently I've been listening to a lot of speedcore, terrorcore .etc stuff I told my self I would never enjoy when I started listening to hard dance. As you can tell by the title that has all changed, so please link me the most fucked up stuff you know! 









 I get most of my hardstyle from the yearly Cloud 9 hardstyle compilations (10$ = 100 songs, great deal) recently I found out about the 2014 compilation and to my sadness I already own two of the songs on the compilation (God said 2k14   Reality) are there any songs that grab you as must haves? [iTunes link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/hardstyle-top-100-2014/id893210852) 









 This February me and my friend will get up on stage in front of 500+ high school students and play a 20 min DJ set. He will be doing 10 min of house and I will be doing 10 min of hardstyle, since most people at my school haven't heard of hardstyle I'm going to do a euphoric set as opposed to a raw one. With that in mind I want my set to be the best euphoric, harmonically mixed gateway into hardstyle ever! Even though I have a lot of euphoric stuff I still want to hear from you guys, so please link me some of your favorite euphoric tracks. Also, producers.... Do you have a track that you think 500+ first time hardstyle listeners would love? Well link me some of your stuff and I'll see what I can do to get your song in my mix :) 


































 I think someone could get a lot of mileage out of doing a parody of music production like by referencing modern talking in massive, vengeance sample packs, pirating and other things. FL Studio would probably be the best choice for this but it could still be funny in other programs like ableton, logic, reason, cubase and pro tools

 Hello everyone. As the title says can someone fill me in? I haven't seen any spam (I'm guessing the mods deleted it). Also can someone tell me how it all started, thanks :)

p.s. I promise I'm not trying to agitate the situation if someone tells me to take this down I will. 




 1.What are some of your hobbies? 2. Besides hard dance what other genres on music do you like? 3. Favorite food? 4. What got you into music as a whole? 5. Can I post your response on the hardstyle sub?


1. Hobbies, anything i do is geared towards improving myself and my creativity. Be that weight training (clears body and mind) reading up on art techniques (going through a graffiti phase) or minecraft (started a few days ago, experiencing a new world), I try to keep things varied. Might take up fishing next.
2. I actually try to listen to as little hard dance as possible. This is because I want to keep my 'work' fresh and not to be over saturated with the same sounds all the time. I listen to a lot of drum and bass and movie scores, but often house, trap n moomba.
3. All food when prepared with fresh, quality ingredients is awesome. I do have a soft spot for italian cuisine, but I love a good kangaroo steak too.
4. I got into music because once I heard it, I wanted to make it. Though this question is a bit like Alice in Wonderland, the hole goes as far as you want it to go....
5. Sure. Dunno if its gonna be that interesting tho.

 














 What's your favorite distortion plug-in and why? For me I'd have to say ohmicide, it's easy to use and you can get great results with it 














 Hello all! Yesterday I made a [monstercat anime post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Monstercat/comments/2gil1y/lets_make_a_monstercat_anime/) and from the looks of it, it didn't do too well :/, but I won't let that discourage me! (If this post doesn't do well promise I won't do more) so any ways here's the premise: make up a morning routine for you favorite producer (make it as bad or as good as you want!) I'll start! " Rameses was awoken from his deep sleep by the familiar sound of rain. He quietly got out of bed and went to the window and stared out at the cloudy Yorkshire landscape. "I could wright so meany songs about this" he thought to himself, and before he knew it he had been starring out his window for 30 minuets. When he finally snapped out of it he saw he was going to be late if he didn't hurry, so he quickly ran downstairs grabbed his crumpet with jam and rushed out the door. (forgetting his umbrella I might add :3) 
























 everything is reverberating (even the start up sound) I've tried opening a new project and restarting my computer but nothings working. [heres what it sounds like](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/problem)
EDIT: It is my sound card. dose anyone know how to fix it? 
  














 I've noticed that quite a few people on here listen to rap so tell me... Who are your favorites? Mine are P.O.S/Doomtree, Brother Ali and Atmosphere (you might notice a bias here, that's because I live really close too the twin cities)  



















 "for those curious i'm 90% done with say it ain't so. another week or two and i'll start shopping to labels"
 





























 A while ago I saw this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/2dx51k/ive_always_loved_the_scifi_style_album_covers_for/) about how cool looking pretty lights album art was. So I decided why not share some cool art but this time with a heavy/industrial look. Also for those wondering Vision recordings is Noisia's record label and for those who don't know who Noisia is they are a 3 man neuro funk/DnB group and I highly recommend them!

 I've been getting into Melbourne bounce lately and I need some artist suggestions   









 For me I'd have to say TC's dog [Rex](https://m.facebook.com/tc.bristol/photos/pb.48469779094.-2207520000.1409108882./10152483245584095/?type=1 source=42) 









 I know we have some shufflers/jumpers on here and I would love too see you guys in action! Post a video of your self :D 







































 John Berkey was a artist who made [breath](http://www.fond-ecran.com/ORIGINAUX/divers/john_berkey/john_berkey_011.jpg) [taking](http://www.tucoo.com/fantasy/f_john_berkey/images/sf_john_berkey016.jpg) space ship scenes (and saying that isn't doing his art nearly enough justice). Now, some of you may be thinking "say this looks a little bit like star wars" well thats because he [did](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DuQ1FWS6Iiw/UR70HxsiF6I/AAAAAAAAdVw/3iMF1oTIWzs/s1600/star-wars-cover__john_berkey.jpg) do some art for the star wars movies. Also on an unrelated note John Berkey is the reason I know some one at VALVe and one of the reasons I got to take a tour of VALVe HQ    




 Dear Pat Powertuff, because of your expertise in the subject of RE4 I was finally able to beat it, I also learned a few things from your play through with matt: the Red9 is the perfect weapon for leading a one man crusade across "Rural Europe", the TMP is a hardened black turd (Although the ammo box is super hype), shotguns are mans greatest creation, knifes are great against crazy buff military mans, verdugos are SUPER cool!!, Salazar's whine when he gets stabbed in the hand is one of the best stupid noises I've ever heard, the broken butterfly is basically deaths scythe in the form of a magnum and finally separate ways sucks :( the only kinda good thing about it is you get to stare at Ada's butt the whole time. Best regards, test_subject8320 




 Before I goto bed I like to listen to music and in doing so I've noticed something about myself. Listening to Hardcore, Hard Trance, Hardstyle and Psy/Forest Trance actually helps me sleep while listening to Chill music by people like Mr. FijiWiji, Rameses B and Direct actually makes me less tired. Dose this apply to anyone else or is their just something wrong with my brain?  
























 I honestly love both. I love the happy up beat melodies of UK Hardcore but I also love the violently distorted kicks of Hardcore  









 My questions were:

1. Do you ever plan on doing hardcore (the non happy kind)?

2. Who are your musical influences?

3. I remember you said somewhere that you don't do collabs so if you were forced at gun point who would you collab with?

4. Can I post your response to the monstercat sub? Stay kawaii!!!!


Here's his response:

1. i really dislike the non-happy hardcore you're talking about because it doesn't 
 have any elements at all that i value in music, so no

2. mitch murder (synthwave and 80s music overall), dj shimamura, kz, early owl city.

3. i said i don't do collabs with just ANYONE. there needs to be some form of friendship established through chats or whatever imo. but if i'd have to pick someone it'd be mitch murder

4. sure. you too ()

 





































































 My questions were 1. Who are your musical influences? 2. Are any of your new tracks collaborations? 3. Can I post your response to /r/Monstercat?

Here's what he had to say:

1. I'm influenced by everything- both in music and through visual art! My older tracks just kind of happened, I just sat down and made them, no specific inspiration there!

2. No collabs- I work in a very drawn out way and I like to get things sounding exactly right before moving on, especially with my new music. I don't think many collaborators would be cool with sitting around for months working on something! That said I do have plans to work with vocalists in the future- but not the traditional "vocalist sings verse on track" kind of way, I'll have her sing whatever, and then chop it up/process it like an instrument. I like vocal snippets and how they can convey the emotion of a vocal, without actually having any discernible words. Looking to take that to the next level with my unreleased stuff!

3. Sure thing, fine by me!
 














 its by SMD and it has a guy laughing in the beginning   



















 Free songs are preferred but not required, also it doesn't just have to be monstercat  














 For me it's jay cosmic's remix of rocket  






















































 For me it's a tie between the screech from dragon born by Headhunterz and the screech from destroy by Atmozfears  









 So I did a post like this on the monstercat sub awhile ago and it got a pretty good reception. 
 Rules:
post a mix that your proud of (preferably hardstyle) in the comments and say what you use for mixing the winner will be the person with the most up votes 

* what you win: my respect as a DJ and the love of the sub (possibly) 




 I know Audiofreq has one  




 As you all know Mr. Suicide sheep always finds amazing pictures to go along with his uploads. [My favorite is this one](http://arcipello.deviantart.com/art/Scorched-earth-304068383) it's actually my back round in FL studio  














 Same Rules as [last time](http://www.reddit.com/r/Monstercat/comments/27uk1n/djs_lets_have_a_little_competition/) if you competed last time just post a diffrent mix  





























 So a while ago F3tch released some patches for massive. All of them are very robotic and gritty so they might not be for every producer, but for the ones who make heavy dubstep I would recommend checking them out [heres a link to his FB page](https://www.facebook.com/F3tchmusic/app_220150904689418) 




 "Something more. Better. Greater. Meaningful. Unforgettable. Beautiful.

In the near Future."
 









 Timeless is probably my favorite. Her voice just adds so much to the song  




 Here's what he had to say "Oh awesome!   I've been considering doing some more collabs in the EDM world, maybe something trap-y.   Thanks for showing me yo " 




 By colorful I mean people like Madeon and Grant Bowtie  









 For me it would either have to be Aero Chord or Noisestorm (Aero Chord is from Greece and Noisestrom is from Dublin so it be awesome to hear their sexy accents also) 




 INFO: 
1. Post a mix you've made below (doesn't have to include monstercat songs)
2. Say what software you use (you don't have to but still it would be cool to know)

RULES FOR VOTING:
Be fair and nice, don't judge on length but on song choice, transitions, etc. 

The winner will be the person with the most points on their comment 

WHAT YOU WIN: 
1. My respect as a DJ
2. The love of our savior GQ (Maybe)   




 What do you guys think? 




 I have been watching quiet a few videos from before 2010 and I have to say, the Melbourne shuffle is really cool and it makes me a little sad that its not as popular as it used to be. So /r/ Monstercat can we bring it back or should I ask /r/ Hardstyle about this ?   




 When do you guys think it will be released?  
























 Dude I know... BS2 gets hate sometimes but I loved it, while the story did have afew plot holes I felt it improved on everything else especially combat and atmosphere (plus Minerva's den is probably one of my fave DLC's of all time) 




 Didn't superman kill more people in MOS then Godzilla in the latest Godzilla film?
 




 Should I buy it? (I own all the bioshocks and love them all to death especially BS2)
EDIT: Bought SS2 and I'm really surprised on how well it holds up (game play wise any way) It was definitely worth the 3$ and I also am hearing some sound effects that were used in BS1   




 I found a bunk file in my uninstall, removed it and everything is fine now :)  




 At my school some kids have speakers in their back packs... Needless to say its fucking irritating  




 Thanks :) 




 Recently I downloaded VLC media player off a bad site and it screwed with internet explorer and chrome (slower then normal and pop-ups). I was able to find where the junk files installed and deleted the file and completely cleared my browser cash but chrome is still running slow and while it happens a lot less then before I'm still getting pop-ups. Virus scans show nothing (windows defender) (I don't know my specs from memory so I will update this later if need be). 




 Wow man! Thanks for this, I could never really pin down what nu-style was so I guessed as much but form the bottom of my heart... Thanks :) P.S. Yoji is awesome (still trying to find a place where I can buy airport :/) 




 One of Shingo's older songs, the kick isn't great and with youtube being what it was back in 09 the quality is a little rough. Look past that however and you will be hooked! P.S. If your into speedcore check out Shingo's other alias Round Wave Crusher (RWC) 









 I AM RADIATING HYPE LIKE A SUPER SAYAN! 




 I see what you mean 




 I use to draw the line at Gabber but now I've heard it all, Speedcore all the way up to extra tone. I traveled to the edge of the abyss, listened and enjoyed what I heard :^ ) 




 :( I didn't get to see the show because the the venue was 18+  




 Slum Village - Fall in love (Moody Good Remix) 




 Life with a monster girl..... ^^^^^^^^^^^Iwasneverhere 




 Captain: "Run full speed and just don't think about it"

Crew member: "But captain I don't think..." 

Captain: "Don't think about it"  




 OMG! That's the exact sign from FO3   FO:NV 

EDIT: Just rememberd that Bethesda was the publisher for this game 




 His FB page is still active but as for realeases IDK 









 I don't really know of any albums but have you tried hard trance? :) It's great for zoning out and quite a few of the songs I have heard have a bit of a sci-if feel to them :) check out the song "disarray" by Lisa lashes, Alex kidd   Kidd kaos (be sure to let me know if you need suggestions :D 




 Not exactaly what I'm looking for but thanks for showing me this :) it's got a really nostalgic vibe to it 




 Dose anyone know of any songs that have propaganda samples form WWII or The Cold War? 




 Do you guys know of any songs with samples of propaganda from WWII or The Cold War 




 He also tweeted at nanobii that he loved his music  




 Yes! Happy Hardcore FTW! If you like this track you might also like UK Hardcore and Hands-Up! 




 You mean Castles in the sky by DJ Satomi? That song is my jam! 









 Ohhhh.... I see what you mean and no I don't think so 




 Man... Qlimax 2006 looked like it was a lot of fun! Who did the anthem for this one? 




 I don't understand the question 




 NP :) 




 Neilio releases on labels like dirtyworkz and skranix (Hardstyle labes) 




 I haven't heard of any of those guys before! Guess I got to do some searching :)

 Also if your looking to get into freeform check out [Alek Szahala](http://youtu.be/uube-JJarcc) 




 Also while he isn't japanese, Shingo DJ/Round Wave Crusher has done a lot of touhou remixes and samples a lot of Hentai/Anime for his songs

 Remember when Prizyms first started posting Hardstyle to the sub? Well it's been a while and I have to ask, how dose everyone feel about hard dance now? I Actually love it more then I ever thought I would! I've been listening to genres I though I would always hate (speedcore and beond)  









 LOVE R.O. Belgian swing was amazing!  




 theirs a art to being a charming ass and Joel nails it  




 "Dike Martians" I guess monstercat's home planet was pretty kinky (   ) 




 He also loves hardstyle 




 Especially so if said artists have done work with noisia! 




 You guys should bug nick to get a reddit account 




 Maby a part for string bass? :D 




 It's awesome knowing that you like bee and puppy cat 

EDIT: what did you think of the first two episodes? 




 All we need is nick and the entirety of evol intent will be here 









 Computer club ILY M8 p.s. The liquid was amazing 3 




 Monstercat should meet a girl monstercat at some point. I think that would be cute 




 Prizymz actually is spinnin' (he dose their cover art) 









 If your not familiar with EVOL Intent, it is a group of three guys (one of those guys being bro safari) who mainly make DnB and have done songs with Noisia and give out a lot of their music for free over soundcloud  




 Your GQ comes with a free car, but you gotta pay tax  




 Ill do my best senpai!!!! (  ) 




 any idea where i can find some good reads on supersaws? :) 




 Dose anyone know of any good patches/tutorials? I have the FL signature bundle and harmor if that helps :) 









 [Downlink and Calvertron - Immortal (F3tch Remix)](http://www.beatport.com/track/immortal-f3tch-remix/5773480)

 









 TFW when you don't have a monstercat to snuggle with 




 Kawaii AF + DnB x nanobii - possible cover art by skrillbug if he chooses to finish this = ()*:	 




 It's one of the songs that got me started on trance  




 Wow that's a good remix! [heres a link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7UVCxcW46Y) to RWC's remix of reach for the moon immortal smoke 




 If your interested you should checkout some of shingo's other thohou remixes, he's done a lot. (He's also remixed a few songs as Round Wave Crusher) 




 I will do the best I can :) 




 Just downloaded Bad Boi   the uncaged remixes. Looking at my Traktor library I'm sitting on a lot of PBN songs, sooo mega mix anyone.... All the PBN songs I have (excluding the one's I can't mix nicely) originals and remixes 




 Not a huge fan of the kick in this one but if you look past it and listen to the melody you will be hooked!!!  









 That sounds awesome!!!! It could be a genre use to classify futile Japan style trance 




 Why can't people just leave the poor guy alone? 




 Plus more money to swery means a better chance of D4 Pt.2 coming out 




 Your pickles come with a free car but you got to pay tax on it 




 Swery should get a reddit account so people can ask him about clam chowder  




 I see him! 
 




 0_0 wow... And I thought Mordor was inhospitable before. This would actually be really cool in the movies though, a place where you are either freezing or super hot, all while being watched by the eye 




 Like pats many little babby yelps could be used for text notifications 

"AH!" Ooo it looks like I got a text 




 Oh wow :( I just got a really sad though in my head... It's of shep. Going into the gun room and seeing one of the those tags hanging from one of the guns and silently weeping because she got the Turian she loved killed 




 Ya up here in Wisconsin it gets down to -10 F at night 




 Come on man learn the lore, everyone knows the Asari evolved from crabs /s 




 you'd probably want WAV. or higher for modding 

EDIT: Actually you could use MP3's it just depends on how well compressed they are 




 I didn't notice the legs until you guys pointed it out.... jeez it looks like Liara was staying in the uncanny valley when this was painted   




 The thumbnail makes it look like shes doing [this](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121209083120/adventuretimewithfinnandjake/images/a/a6/Mckayla_is_Unimpressed.png), Cool shep. though! :D 




 Bring it here bro *opens arms for hugz* 




 I think they would make really cool one shots for DJing 




 I would really like one in red (purple is a sweet color but I've always liked the red hoods better)  




 Oh the fun I will have with this in FL 11 




 Freeform!!!! Check out Alek Szahala  




 You might like freeform :) it's a combination of hardcore and trance. [Check this one out](http://youtu.be/uube-JJarcc) 














 Woa... :0 thanks dude! 




 I've been getting into the genre lately and I was woundering if some one could give me some suggestions :) 




 Actually their all full tracks (with a few edits thrown in) 




 I accidentally deleted my comment with all the songs I linked :I I'll just give them to you and link them later 

Ophidian - Sounds of the machine 

Meander (Ophidian's crossbreed alias) - Greyscale

Angerfist - And Jeasus wept 

Kobaryo - Clock Control 

I:gor - The Devil has a name

Outside Agency - Hours   Dreams

S3rl - Feel the melody  




 Thanks man! 




 In E-force's song seven the tempo goes up at the second climax and then goes back to 150 for the next, dose anyone know what the tempo goes up to? I'm having a hard time figuring it out  




 If you showed him a pic of that he would block you on Twitter  




 Hard Dance: Kobaryo (he's already had a few releases on mob squad but it would be cool to see him bring the gabber sound to MC) 




 All right m7s let's get to know eachother a little better :), I absolutely love hard dance! If you don't know what that is it's stuff like hardcore, hardstyle, hard house, hard trance .etc 




 How did you get out of Skyrim with the war going on? (Torbjrn is the most Skyrimish name I have ever heard) 




 Scary monsters and nice sprites will always have a special place in my heart 




 Lisa lashes v.s Alex Kidd and Kidd Kaos - Dissaray (amazing hard trance) 




 Oh..... OH! Ow  




 During sophomore year (last year) this freshman girl came to school with face paint on. I'm talking full face cheeta patern..... P.S. You sound like a cool girl :) 




 toonie? 




 I remember back in middle school in the wake of COD black ops people would sharpen pencils to a dangerous point and whip them at each other while yelling "Tomahawk!" I think one kid got stuck in the leg with a colored pencil  




 I followed the advice given to me and I have to say I'm happy with how it turned out, I updated the [PP](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-dST9JfmygNvSEaYppJVyBqe36W_bYfXJMalfE6xZjU/edit?usp=sharing) and the [mix](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/hard-dance-lession-update) (this one flows a lot better), I also dropped Breakcore in favor of Tekstyle and I think a certain someone on this sub will be happy with my hardstyle song choice ;) *cough cough* /u/audiofrq     




 I know the pic he's talking about!! Allow me to do some digging 

EDIT: [Found it!](http://25.media.tumblr.com/bb0681713936b617bc3d3ac099dbaee7/tumblr_muqkczkYBi1s0aezvo1_250.png) sorry the image is so small

 Have you heard his latest album? One word... Lush 




 we must de-Liam them before the milk goes sour and makes woolie (and anyone really) vomit  




 Where do I sign up?! 




 Woa Jack of sound... on Mcat.... 3 




 The R Is Silent is amazing! great combo of neruo and dubstep 




 Did anyone notice the ships shadow? It was like 20FPS

EDIT: it should cut to Liam holding his vita crying and saying it was worth it surrounded by the 3 games the vita has 




 It would be cool to see this girl do a cover of bad apple 




 Probably ment to say "what the F" but engrish  




 He was trained by a master of CQC 




 0_0 I never knew you were on reddit! Also thank you for answering my question, I think I speak for everyone on here when I say that I can't wait! 




 Thanks! This will help a lot with kick making  




 So in less techinal terms it's the "Punch" at the beginning of the kick? P.s. Thank you :) 




 Sorry for the noobish question but I've been seeing the term a lot and I don't really have a firm grasp on it 




 It would be cool to see more electro from him but I have to say his mid-tempo stuff is my favorite 




 Check that reverse bass! 









 I remember reading some where that ophidian and Sam were working on something together, did anything ever come out of it? 




 If be fine with that especially if we get more songs like mirror mirror 




 Get your sides to send picks (especially of the clam chowder) 




 Yes yes yes yes!!! 




 Me too ^^^^choo^^^^choo 




 Sadly my presentation can only be 10min and putting showtek in there is just me forgetting to put "(older work)" next to them 




 Oh I didn't mean boring in that way, what I meant was if you find that it's becoming a slog or if your getting bored working on a track taking a little video game (or anything else really) break can be refreshing and will inspire/clear your mind 




 Hmmm.. You do have some good points, I'll rework it a bit and see if I can get a better progression out of it. Also before I replaced it with "worth fighting for" the song I had was Accelerate, the reason I changed it was it didn't think it went with all the other songs I have in the mix  




 Same with me but just remember when it starts to get boring a little break can make you feel awesome :) 




 VIDEO GAMES!!!
 




 Hello everyone! you may remember me as the guy who asked for euphoric hardstyle needed in a [mix for a school talent show](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardstyle/comments/2itn3g/a_call_to_everyone/), well here's an update. Me and my friend decided to do our own things for the talent show, it was after that I got to thinking "why just show people hardstyle when there's a whole genre of music (Hard Dance) I could expose them too". So after some work I have made a mix and a power point, I'm going to do a live mix while projecting the power point behind me. Each slide will have the genre of the current song, facts and what song is currently playing. This is where you guys come in, [heres a link to the mix](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/hard-dance-lession) [and heres a link to the PP](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-dST9JfmygNvSEaYppJVyBqe36W_bYfXJMalfE6xZjU/edit?usp=sharing), I've made it so you guys can leave notes on the PP in case I got any facts wrong. Thanks in advance :)  




 [Based freq gave a good explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardstyle/comments/287r9t/holy_shtball_these_kicks_sound_like_nuclear/ci8ww6v) 




 I searched "kpop hardstyle" 









 He's soo cute 




 [ummmmmm](https://soundcloud.com/djmatduke/matduke-utopia) 




 IDK what arion's been up too and as for GQ he might be working on some music  




 Kai wachi hype! 




 Never never never never compare yourself to your favorite producer/s it never helps the creative process and it will make you feel bad about your self. I'm an aspiring hard dance producer and when ever I think I have a good kick I remember how sweet and amazing ophidians, audiofreqs, zatoxs, angerfists, nosferatus.etc kicks sound and I feel so bad. Take your time, watch some videos (seamlessR FTW) and most importantly have fun because if your not having fun your basically working a day job you payed 600$+ for 




 Link to the space fund plz 




 For those wondering where this is from, in the gal gun video Liam said that plague sent him a link to these. Oh plague senpai... (`) you with your ahegao faces and busty furry girls (still waiting on the fan art of the lizard girls from bug island plague)
