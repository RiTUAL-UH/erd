 Yeah, I'm back on them now broseph.  




 Edit: I've been back on my meds, but I've kinda not taken them properly? What I mean by this is, I wake up at weird times of the day, so I take my morning dose a little bit later and my nightly dose a little bit later, but so far, I still have my symptoms somewhat under control.  




 Those are non-specific symptoms I believe. 




 I think we still use it, but very rarely... Do vets not use it anymore? 




 I live in the UK and I know that we use it but I've never actually even seen anyone on ketamine here, weird. I would love to try some if I could find it somewhere.  




 I started taking prescription opiates at about 14-15 with my girlfriend at the time. Do I regret it? Yes and No.  




 That's pretty much true I suppose, but it definitely depends on how you look at it. For example, opiates, benzos etc. won't produce the same "euphoria" as say, MDMA, Cocaine etc. 

 




 I was just wondering what your thoughts on stimulants were? I know that for me when I have some extra money I will buy any real stimulant I can get, usually Methylphenidate and Amphetamine (Rarely). I usually do this 1-3 times a year, but from my recent usage of stimulants I have realized that I don't really like them that much, but I use them because I used to really, really love stimulants. It's kind of a weird relationship with them.

Anyway, what are your thoughts on stimulants? 




 Why the heck would they put someone with psychosis on anti depressants, especially Bupropion. They should've started you off with an anti psychotic first, that's what usually SHOULD happen. 

How long do you have to wait for? (I live the UK so I don't really understand health insurances). 

Edit: If you were depressed before, then you should've been put on an anti depressant AND an anti psychotic, but it's still kinda weird putting someone with Drug Induced Psychosis on anti depressants, especially if it wasn't caused by the depression (Psychotic depression).  




 Mood lift does count as euphoria, same with sociability (to me anyway, because I'm usually not social). Well I didn't feel anything noticeably physical, so I don't think it was much L-Amphetamine, but I could be wrong on that.  




 I think your doc is correct, you are definitely paranoid for sure, so the drug induced psychosis thing is definitely a good Dx. I have schizophrenia, so I know what it's like, albeit a little different but when I'm in a psychotic break, its essentially all the same. Are you taking any medications for this psychosis? 

MDMA and Coke can both cause psychosis if abused the way you abused them, and acid also can I believe, but more commonly it's usually HPPD with acid but psychosis can definitely happen with the use of acid as well. So basically, you abused 3 drugs that can cause psychosis... Hopefully you're taking some meds, or therapy at least, but psychosis usually can't be solved by just therapy itself.

Stay safe.  




 You do realize that Amphetamine is a euphoriant?  




 So, I remember taking Freebase (Paste) Amphetamine from the streets that my sister had at my cousins wedding, she gave me a dab of it, and it didn't feel as good as something like Ritalin (that I've use quite a lot in the past). I know Amphetamine is meant to be better than Ritalin, but to me, it felt like pretty much nothing. I thought this was weird, I did get a nice feel for the music and I did get pretty talkative, but not that much, and there was no body like euphoria there. Why is this? It's kinda strange to me.  




 DHC is good, it actually feels a tad weaker than codeine to me for some reason, but it definitely lasts A LOT longer. I'm guessing codeine is pretty strong for me because I must be a good metaboliser. Have fun. 




 I've never really felt anything from caffeine, it hardly even keeps me awake, but I do drink a lot of energy drinks and stuff pretty much daily.  




 Why do people say, "I laughed longer than I should have"... How long are you meant to laugh, is there guidelines that I don't know about?  




 During the black death, it wasn't just the bubonic plague, it was also the pneumonic plague, which, is extremely contagious.  




 If you can't even speak proper English, then you can't make a cheat, whatsoever.  




 I can tell you this with experience, a lot of the time when someone gets a prescription for oxy, sooner or later, they will do something illegal with it (snorting, injecting, or just taking it for a buzz and no longer for pain). Criminalizing anyone for drug abuse/use when they are otherwise a loving parent is just, insane. Also, I think you CAN do something about it, YOU can also fight back at the heart of it.

And it would be nice to become a foster parent when I'm a little older. 

But can't you just change something at the core? Yeah, we should do something to, but YOU (and others that work in the system) can change it at it's very core. 




 Thing is, weed? Really? You wouldn't take a kid away from a family that has a few too many every night, but are otherwise loving... I just don't get it. 

Also, a parent popping a few oxy because of their "bad back" is fine, right? But weed obviously isn't because its the "law". 




 If you truly believe in that, then you aren't a modern feminist, so, good for you.

You're an egalitarian, which is great.  




 I'm sorry, but is a job more important than a persons life?  




 Hey, why don't you draw something as good or even better than this then? 




 This is actually somewhat a good story, believable and the doc will also feel sorry for you. 




 Not exactly true in all cases. 




 I had a very hard time, I know I'm schizophrenic but I there has been people that do good without meds.  




 Where do you live? I live in the UK and people with bad back pain, arthritis (depends on the type) and other shit get opiates codeine to oxy.  




 Why do people not like morphine? I dont get it... 




 Okay, so I know its incredibly stupid to come off meds without a doctors go ahead or supervision, but I accidentally came off my meds a few days ago (Seroquel) and I'm not doing so bad, the meds were working, which is good, but I wonder how long I can last before I relapse into the illness again... What if I never get ill again? I mean, do I need the meds? I'm not even sure if I even need meds... 

This is just some thoughts I wanted to write down and decided to make a reddit post.  




 Also, the OP is 20, opiate prescriptions at 20 aren't uncommon at all. 




 Question, how does going on methadone or sub screw the OP from an opiate script for the rest of his life? Here in the UK (depending on the doc I guess) I can still get opiate prescriptions for legit pain even though I am a recognized addict, even though its a little harder I might add.

Is it different in the US? Because I'm sure a doc wont just leave someone in pain just because someone's an addict. 




 Man, that's fucked up. I live in W. Scotland and my town is like 10k population (if that) and I can walk to the pharmacy which is about 5 mins walking and I'd probably see at least one or two blatant heroin addicts.  




 You may be schizophrenic, but most of what you describe is some sort of personality disorder, like sociopathy with some narcissism... Can anyone correct me if I'm truly wrong?  




 I'm sorry, but how can you be a junkie depending on the day you're having? Elaborate please. 

And western feminism is completely lost... Equalitarianism is better. 




 Either idiocy or extreme corruption.  




 Feminazis are worse than any form of junkie, so it really doesn't matter.  




 I've heard a while back (kinda just remembered) that a lot of schizophrenics gets better faster and better over time than the ones on meds. In my opinion I think that's somewhat false because everyone is different, but have you heard about that?  




 Morning is usually a break from my illness for me, until about 2 hours after I wake up, and then when it hits dark, I get really paranoid and my illness basically just gets worse during the dark.

I also get more depressed during the dark.  




 I know this is old news but it really does outrage me when shitty clinically retarded (probably 10 IQ) come into someone's house and shoot a harmless dog (and I mean harmless, eg labs, Jack Russell's etc) for no good reason other than being a brainless sub 10 IQ moron that should be euthanised. YOU DO NOT TAKE A DOGS LIFE OVER DRUGS, ESPECIALLY WEED. 

Also to cops that know cops that do this, give them this message, if
you come into my house and shoot anything for no reason, I will, and I repeat, I will get a gun and blow atleast one of your retarded brains out, thanks. 

I don't care If this sounds stupid, but it angers me beyond belief. Thanks for listening.   




 Either a mental condition or he is just fucking with everyone. 




 It's sad that certain African countries governments are so corrupt that they give about 2% of the donations to their people basically live and THRIVE through them. Have you seen certain African country leaders? They live in wealth, while their people live in extreme poverty.  




 Also, does any leader that starts unnecessary wars deserve compassion? Like a lot of US presidents, UK prime ministers etc? 

But civilians that have done nothing to deserve this, they indeed, need all the compassion they can get.  




 I love how you take that out of context...  




 Things have changed, but most of the donated cash goes to the government of certain African countries and the government of these countries basically steal the donations. 




 Everyone deserves compassion... 




 Isn't China/Chinese more clean than most of the west as well? Or am I wrong?  




 What do you mean 'Yes'... Do you mean that's what you believe or are you just answering?  




 People still believe schizophrenia means split personality? My god...  




 FEAR THIS NOW!!! 




 Not to give in to hysteria... Does he realise he's talking to the human race here?  




 No one really gives two fucks about terrorists, well compared to this anyway.  




 Enzymes bro, everyone's different. 




 It's not just bad that they're spewing misinformation (of course that's bad) but it's when people basically say that you can't have schizophrenia because you can type or make somewhat coherent sentences, because we already have a hard time believing that we're ill in the first place. 




 So in my experience I have encountered a lot of people that just don't believe schizophrenics are on the Internet. It's gotten to the point that in online society that if you even ADMIT you have schizophrenia, everyone laughs, why is this? It's as if that if you have schizophrenia or even bipolar (to a lesser extent maybe) that you can't come online, it's just simply impossible to these people.

Does the wider Internet still believe that schizophrenics pretty much just sit in a corner and cry or babble insanity as if we are insane? Do they not realise that we are just normal people that can come online and share experiences? I don't get it. 

I've even seen people that are allegedly in a psychosis come on reddit and type their thoughts, of course when I'm in a severe psychosis I don't say anything online about it and sometimes end up in hospital or... Worse, but I'm not in a CONSTANT severe psychosis that some people seem to think. 

So basically what I'm annoyed at is, on the wider Internet if you even ADMIT you're schizophrenic, you're deemed a fake and a "dumbass". Its really put me down because now, I don't know if what I experience is real. Maybe I am just a dumbass. Who knows. 

Please share you're thoughts, this was just a rant.  




 Have fun with that man, Gabapentin and Hydro, nice.  




 So basically what I was saying is that my psychosis came first and I basically found some prescription opiates and thought that maybe this will help (which it did at the time).  




 Yet to read it all yet but for me I started taking opiates (before I was prescribed meds) to basically try and "self medicate" so to speak... So for me it's/was basically a form of instant relief in a way. Anyway, love your blog :). Gonna read it all now.  




 I've been diagnosed btw, I dunno if that was a quote that yoh responded to about me or not haha... anyway may I ask something (that MAY be kinda personal) in a pm?  




 But what I'm telling you is just what I've gathered from a lot of health professionals (neurologists and stuff also) and about a year and a bit of opiate use. 

So schizophrenia wasn't really caused by anything for me, it's just stuff I've gathered from health pros :). 

And even they don't even fully understand the brain  




 Scientifically though, opiate use no matter what stage USUALLY doesn't do anything long term, except maybe depression. Also opiates have Anti depressant, anti anxiety and anti psychotic properties (I have no idea why they have anti psych properties, I don't even think scientists know this because we don't know SHIT about the brain let alone schizophrenia. 

Opiates are actually one of the safest drugs (besides weed, heck even weed can bring schizophrenia out apparently). I know quite a lot about drugs especially opiates and alcohol since I was addicted to opiates and my parents are alcoholics.

 




 It really depends on the drug, for example, opiates/opioids will not give you psychotic symptoms (except maybe through withdrawal) but drugs like amphetamine etc can. So you have to consider that.  




 Yes I have tried a few other meds, they either produced more symptoms or made me a zombie (but not sedated just emotion wise). They're working a little I guess, they've made me more insightful but the symptoms clear up then come back for longer than they've cleared up, it pretty much feels like the meds are trolling me.

I don't feel like being medicated forever, I'm just a little sad with having a mental illness I guess. Thank you for your input. 

Also, it's just my positive symptoms that somewhat get better, negatives never have.  




 I've started seroquel as my new med, I've been on it for a month and a bit, and I've been starting to get a bit better but now it feels like symptoms still breakthrough and they're doing it a lot harder now, are meds just a false hope, I was pretty much better for a week and a half (maybe 2) and it feels like everything is coming back, especially paranoia (not so much the people inside my head).

I think meds are just a false hope... no point in them now. Love you guys :* 




 Make them live with an alcoholic for 15 years. 




 I'm still in that phase were the illness is really bad... And what makes the social aspect worse is, I have really bad disorganized thoughts, I talk a little like this, "yeah so I um I dunno what I was saying so maybe we can go and chill out at the mountain? Yeah uh, yeah I dunno". Which is hard. 




 Ever since I got my first symptoms of this disease I started withdrawing, it took a little over a year to basically be in complete isolation, I'm in the midst of this isolation and it's killing me, it feels like I've pushed all of them away, and it hurts that I don't have my best friend anymore, he's been my friend for a very long time. 
Please help me, I don't know what to do, I see pictures of all of them having fun on Facebook, I drove past them all today, and they saw me like they saw a ghost... I just want my old life back. 




 Would you rather everyone essentially going mad?  




 Man, I can't handle pain at all. I had a lumbar puncture and needed pain meds for a week or two. Your pain threshold must be higher than Pluto compared to mine. 




 WHAT? No narcotics? Damn, how can it not hurt? I thought the mouth and stuff had pain receptors. 




 http://imgur.com/qUlb8G4 




 I feel like I'm a pussy for not being able to handle it better, sometimes I think everyone has what I have and they're just better at dealing with it and I'm lower than everyone.

Thank you, a lot. I don't know if I've hit rock yet, but I think I'm slowly getting there, but I don't want to, I want to go up NOW!!! 




 I did start CBT but I never finished it. It's really hard to do CBT for depression and anxiety when I'm psychotic, thank you for giving moral support so to speak. 




 Hey. So I've had moderate episodic depression for a while now along with schizophrenia and I just feel like it never gets better, the loneliness, the sadness, emptiness etc. sometimes when I come out of it I think that I will never go back into it, only to find my self depressed again. It's like it gives me hope when it goes away, and then takes all that hope away when it comes back.

Meh, I must just be a pussy. But does it ever get fully better? Ever?  




 But why would people thinking because I'm sometimes aware I'm ill that I can't be disabled with it? That's like saying people that know they have the flu or cancer can't be disabled with it, right? 




 Well, she thought the symptoms of schizophrenia weren't actually symptoms, which obviously made my depression worse because she put me down for having symptoms that she didn't see as symptoms... I just want to know why people do that? I don't get it.

And of course it made my schizophrenia worse because I lost more and more insight because of her.  




 I'm not irritated at all by self diagnoses, as long as you're very educated on mental health, as you said you were.

People in my family knew I was schizophrenic before any doc diagnosed me, so self diagnoses or semi self diagnoses or family diagnoses (in my case) can be helpful to the person and the doctor that will later diagnose you, well, in my case that's how it went.

And all you can do is get out of the house and get a psychiatrist AND psychologist and if you need one, someone that's educated on mindfulness, or research that form of meditation yourself and try it out while you're "in the dark" so to speak when it comes to meds. :)  




 The people that you would never think to even be depressed, commit suicide from it... It's extremely sad and shocking.

I'm very sorry, RIP.  




 Hey, so a story of my ex girlfriend... 

Well, every time I was in the midst of a delusion and acting weird and strange, and very out there and you know, "paranoid", she would get angry and say, "you can't POSSIBLY blame your disorder/illness for this", I found this very insensitive and out right stupid.

As the disease progressed I would stop seeing people, essentially isolating and not washing and having thought issues, like word salad, and again she would look at me weirdly, scoff and say, "you can't blame schizophrenia *scoff*"... Funny thing is I never blamed schizophrenia at all.

And this goes for hallucinations and my depressive episodes too.

Why is this? Please answer anyway you want, you don't have to be nice if you don't want to :).  




 How do you know you're bipolar without a Dx? 




 I have a form if schizophrenia, and I'd like to ask, what's the worst mental illness to date? Jw.  




 Do you like fame? If so, why? 




 Everything in my head is telling me I'm dying, I just want some help, I'm in seroquel, I just want something to make me feel normal. I feel really trapped in my head and don't have anyone really to talk to. Thank you. 




 I've been told it can happen in psychotic disorders too (but I might be wrong). Maybe your brain is overwhelmed with all the noise and stuff and becoming detached. 

And trauma doesn't HAVE to happen, no.  




 Dissociation? 




 Sorry for bad writing  




 Oh and suicide wasn't exactly in my thought, I'm thinking ebola got me  




 I love I'm the uk and I got sick and I'm in fear of my life that I got or had ebola and I'm giving it to people or that I'm slowly dying from it without knowing... And even if I didn't get it, what stops me from getting it in the future, I don't know what I'm even thinking... Just round and round, ebola, ebola, ebola in my head... What is this?  




 May I ask? Do you have any mental illness that makes you paranoid? Not judging as I do too but I try and not believe my insanity. 




 Hi, im still here. I was having a VERY bad few weeks, I'm starting to have some better days. I has a lumbar puncture so I've been incapacitated with pain. 









 For me at the start of delusions I know it's paranoia, then after a while if I don't take meds for a few weeks while it's starting, or maybe 5 months idk, I totally lose insight and shit... It's all insight. 




 So why are people wanting to kidnap me and my family and torture us? Why can't I think? Why can't I have relationships that last? Why do the voices commentate in what I'm thinking or doing? What is all of this? Why does it even exist, fuck it all.  




 This psychotic shit happens non stop, with or without meds, they just make it easier, without meds, I have no idea what time and place is. 




 I would give you gold if I had money, but most of it goes on opiates  




 Lately I've been having really on and off nausea, I've been having to force myself to vomit... I've been somewhat constipated (not going to the bathroom as much I used to) and unable to pass gas... I feel pretty bloated in the general abdominal, and my stomach is rumbling quite loudly and I've also had a runny nose. What could this be?  




 Either the pain meds (hydro) is causing it, or making the ibs worse... But without extra info or more symptoms I can't say for sure. 




 Well I knew I had some sort of mental illness before most doctors... Didn't know exactly what one, just thought some of the shit I was hearing and thinking wasn't right. 




 Haha, I love you man ha. 




 The longest I've made it is nearly 2 weeks lol, I've tried many times... But bad shit in life when you're trying to stop seems even worse, and that's what always makes me go back, ill try and make today my last:) 




 Alcohol made my dad into a loving caring emotional person into a hateful abusing pile of shit, in a matter of years...  




 I don't even know what I'm doing anymore, opiates aren't even recreational fun anymore, they're just something to block out the pain in life and stop my fucking obsessive fucking tendencies and all that shit, idk what I am saying, just sick of having to go through  so much shit day to day and having to hide it from everyone that can help me... What's the point? Does anyone have any advice here? I need my life back  




 I hate how people say addicts are these evil people, when in reality it's usually the opposite. 




 If I HAD to choose between alcoholism and opiate dependency, I would choose opiate dependency by far... Alcoholism fucked my family up. 
























 That USED to happen to me early into my usage. 




 They have a form of it called Lunesta (Eszopiclone).  




 None anymore but I used to smoke Marlboro and Mayfair (a British brand). 




 Isn't it Sched 1? 




 Overdosing on opiates, especially heroin, would usually kill you quite fast and painlessly when you IV (that's why it's my get out free card). You basically just pass out and not wake up again. Dunno about snorting though, just sounds like you got super high like everyone else is saying.  




 Damn... This sub is actually starting to give gold now, seen it a few places on here... We have evolved! 




 The question is relatively simple but basically every time I don't use I get very, very agitated and angry. The only way to solve it is to know I'm getting some pills or whatever. Does anyone else get this? Is it common? 




 Having to confess a porn addiction for just watching porn at 17 is total and utter retardation. What a shitty situation... *Fucking religion*. 




 Nice one. /s 




 The US doesn't control everything you know... Just sayin'...  




 Do you think these riots will cause something bigger to happen in Mexico? Like a revolution?  




 What I mean by BPD is Borderline Personality Disorder, it's extremely complex, but the symptoms he has from it are basically, suicide threats, and what you just described there "*He's also telling me I'm better off leaving him one moment then demanding we get artificial insemination*" which rings borderline for me. The cold rage as you describe it, definitely sounds either like sociopathy or narcissistic personality disorder, or both (both of them happening together is very common). 

NPD and Sociopathy (anti social personality disorder, but I don't like calling it that because it's way too broad of a term) happen very, very, very commonly. More commonly than I would like to believe. 

He needs either a form of intensive treatment, or you just leaving him, as hard as that may be.  




 This sounds like an incredibly difficult situation. It's downright emotional/psychological abuse, and that can be worse than physical abuse because it lingers for a very long time once you're out of the relationship. Like the others here have said, I've never seen someone with depression persistently abuse their SO, yeah, maybe it happens but it's relatively rare, especially at a persistent rate. I would also like to know what you mean by cold rage? I have an idea, but not sure what you exactly mean by it. Another likely possibility is that he has a personality disorder and not depression, this could range from BPD (which is things like, threats of suicide, self harm etc. among other things of course), Anti-Social PD (basically sociopathy/psychopathy, but I believe it's a more broad term), Narcissistic personality disorder (which, is actually somewhat likely in this case). 

My advice is to take a break and check him into a hospital if you can, in fear for his and yourself's safety. On the break, think, think about your relationship, and think about who he really is and if he deserves to be with you in his current state. 

I'm not a doctor, so I can't exactly say if he's depressed or has a PD or nothing, I just don't exactly know for sure. 

Also, you're definitely not too "old" to have kids, that's silly, 28 yrs old is a decade and a half away from being too "old". Also, fat at 165? That's just simply bullying, and false. 

Anyway, I hope you get through this, life is hard and it's even harder when someone is somewhat weighing you down... As hard as that is to hear.  




 You'll most likely not get a heart attack. I have a history of heart disease in my family, and Ritalin (which is more hard on your heart I believe) has never gave me a heart attack and I've been on and off it for at least 7-8 years. Also, frequent heart burn isn't a thing to do with your heart, it's stomach acid jumping up to the throat and chest and you SHOULD get it checked out, because if it's really frequent it could be GERD.  




 Seroquel is pretty sedating, and by pretty, I mean really, really sedating until you build a good enough tolerance (which is also hard for me because I come off my meds). I am not Bipolar though, just schizophrenic. For some people it doesn't work (or it's just so sedating that there is no point in taking it). 

It takes away the good feelings for anyone I believe because it basically blocks dopamine (among other things). 

The sedation may go away (it does for me if I take it for long enough) or it may not... Will it work? Maybe, or maybe not (if you've been taking it longer than 2.5 weeks and it still hasn't made you feel better, then change the med. 

I would ask your doc for depakote or lithium, and try that with another anti psychotic (abilify might work for you).  




 So here's the thing, I know that the game is supposed to be "emotional" or whatever, but I just don't see it. This game (whether I am watching someone play it or I am playing it myself) doesn't affect me. Is it meant to? I don't feel sad, or anything when someone dies, or when I read something that's supposed to be sad, etc... So my question is, is this game meant to be emotional and is it meant to affect me in any way?  




 Yep, for schizophrenia... I'm not honest with my psychiatrist for reasons but I don't see a psychologist.  




 I agree with everything you say. Some may say I'm even on the extreme end of "freedom of choice" because I believe that most drugs (including highly researched opiates) should be as legal as alcohol (with a little more regulation of course).  




 That stopping isn't as easy as it seems... That alcoholics can actually be worse than drug addicts (and most of the time are)... That alcohol kills way more people, than heroin.  




 Psuedoephedrine is technically "addictive". 




 But it's quite sad. It makes me really wonder how many people are cheating... 




 Well, that's fucked up... I'm guessing you live in the US? 




 On probation at 15?  




 I don't understand why 14-15 year old's would be concerned with getting a piss test... 




 Usually they would use something like a benzodiazepine for nausea, and high doses of opiate pain medications (for pain). Both of them get you high. 




 It also might make you feel nauseas because weed is an anti emetic (I believe).  




 I wonder what it must be like to detox from long term use of laudanum. I've never tried PST, and this is what pretty much scares me to try it.  




 That's a rip off imo. You won't be able to make that money back. 




 She didn't know if it was weed or chloroform. 




 [I didn't know Oxy could cause it](http://gyazo.com/2209fb4ee40eba0d13a15ea827d55d66) 




 He looks like there's no one home in there. "It might have rabies", yeah because when an animal has a disease you want to slit it's throat and get its contaminated blood all over you. *smh*

What an idiotic criminal.  




 "ALL OF THIS IS ON RECORD" 




 It's so fake it's funny.  




 I feel like a lot of people wear merchandise to look cool, or to fit into a certain club at school. Not saying that's what you do keep in mind.  




 I know a lot of people that say that they don't like the feeling... I don't get what's different about us and them. It's weird, I might have to ask them.  




 It's extremely irritating. Kurt Cobain wouldn't even want people buying Nirvana T-Shirts anyway, I'm sure... Especially the people that just wear it to see better than others.  




 You're right, it's basically the hydrocodone of the UK... It doesn't mean that there isn't other opiates around though.  




 I hear that a lot by people that take opiate prescriptions for pain and stuff, that they don't like it... I wonder what makes it different from us and them? 




 If it was Fentanyl wouldn't that have been really overpowering for him or worse, kill him? 




 It's always wisdom teeth I hear about (especially with people in the US). What is it with people getting easy opiates through dentistry? My teeth have always been perfect, damn... 




 The face looks odd for the coat and body, still cute though... Should post on /r/aww. 




 I guess I take it for mental problems as well, even though I'm prescribed Seroquel for my Schizophrenia. Apparently opiates have strong anti depressant, anti anxiety and anti psychotic effects. 

I feel you brother, keep on going, you'll eventually reach that peace of mind, one day.  




 I'm from the UK too, and finding Oxy is kinda difficult, but not too hard, and hydro is not prescribed here for some reason, and finding morphine is quite easy, it's probably the most prescribed pain pill for chronic pain (other than Tramadol for the chronic pain), cancer pain etc. in the UK. The reason it's harder to find pills here in the UK is because the "black market" so to speak for pills don't really exist. In the UK (especially scotland) the black market is FILLED with heroin rather than pills (sadly).  




 Peoples pupils react a little slower, differently etc. But yeah, that's generally true, but as I said, peoples pupils ARE different. Also, going up to a guy looking into his pupils would be kinda weird if you ask me. 




 I hope your brother is safe, and when he comes back (notice I say when because it's positive, *yay*) try and get him some psychological help because when someone is using computer duster, they need psychological help because he is probably running away from something or he's trying to deal with some sort of emotional stress.  




 Nitrous is safer, it's used medically... 

Edit: I know not everything used medically is safe, but somewhat gives credibility that nitrous is a lot safer than fucking Computer Duster.  




 What about nitrous? 




 I have a question. What if someone looks at their usage and doesn't see a problem (when it probably is) or just doesn't care? 




 I've never tried Fent, so how long does it last for *you*? 




 He COULD be using stimulants. On the other hand, he could just be very hyperactive or have ADHD? Who knows. Does it really matter to you though? 




 One word... Lighting.  




 It's sorry, not, "sowwie". 




 I started taking opiates for persistent headaches that I still get when I come off of them (even when I'm past the withdrawal), but when I'm on them I get no headaches whatsoever. These headaches were sometimes extremely debilitating and have made me wake up in pain and throw up, other times they're just a 2-4 on the pain scale but can go up to an easy 7-8. I've never had them really checked out, but I did have an MRI and Lumbar Puncture a few months ago and nothing came up, so obviously it's not a tumour or anything... I've not told doctors about my headaches so I've never had them diagnosed, but I came to the suspicion that they're cluster headaches.

*I take opiates for the high as well, but I legitimately need them for pain.*

Now I have a pain in my tailbone area that's been going on for about 3 weeks I would say, I had it checked out last week and the doctor just gave me some shitty Naproxen (which didn't even touch the pain at all) it's EXTREMELY uncomfortable to sit down and about 7-10 when getting up from the seat. Anyway, that's why I take opiates aswell as chasing that high.

What's your story? 




 I'm sorry brother, sending positive vibes your way.  




 Alex Jones: "YOU'RE ALL GOING TO DIE... But first buy my T-Shirts and my DNA FORCE" 




 Good luck finding that, I'll be here when you do.  




 You like it more than heroin? Damn, I gotta try it sometime.  




 Well, basically, I've liked Nirvana for a couple of months as of now, their music is/was just great, but when I mention I like Nirvana or whatever, someone, somewhere, always says, "Then why don't you have Nirvana T-shirts", or, "You're not a true fan of *enter musician here* if you don't have their *MERCH*". It pisses me off because it basically says, even if you like a band or musician or whatever, if you don't have their "merch" then you're not a true fan or a big of a fan as me... As if it's a contest, FUCK YOU to whoever does this.  




 I doubt she would use your hand, that would be lack of trust on another level right there. 1.5 weeks is a long time without talking to your GF/BF/Wife/Husband. I hope (for you) that maybe she's either just, 1.) Sick (Cold, Flu, Allergies, whatever). 2.) Just busy. Hopefully she isn't mad with you or breaking up with you. All the best, stay calm because worrying  and panicking just makes things 10x worse for you.  




 If you've been with her for a while, at least 3 months, then the likely hood of a vengeful ex is pretty slim. Does she know your pass code on your phone? I would just chill out for now and wait and see what happens... I take it she's ignored further text's?  




 Just before me and my ex-GF fully broke up we didn't speak to each other for a week or two, but then again, before that we hadn't even seen each other in person for months. Also, how do you think she would've found out?  




 Opiate crack. 




 [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_fever) 




 Well... Good for you? 




 No, I am Renton from trainspotting.  




 Damn, I wish my psychiatrist or whatever got high...  




 Some people like the 90s grunge junkie look. 




 I always thought having an uncontrollable erection would be great, because if you took some opiates with it you could last forever. 




 You're saying that without giving much information. When someone wants to do something and someone says, "No, do not do it", or anything like that, it makes them want to do it more.  




 You sayin' we're fucked up here? Wanna fight about it? Just kidding, I agree with you 100%.  




 "Disappear" 




 Calling an ambulance was probably the best thing ever. You weren't even there and you still called one for her, that's great. On the other hand, It's not great that you HAD to call the ambulance, I wish you all the luck, I hope she pulls through, my love goes to you and your friend. 

GHB and Benzo's are a no no no no no no mix.  




 Yeah, you definitely don't retain full tolerance forever and ever, that'd just be biologically impossible, but I'm sure that I heard somewhere that your body can handle it better than people that are completely naive.  




 Snort all the dust off the screen? I don't know, just a suggestion.  




 That's something I'm gonna research, your tolerance obviously lowers after months, but I've heard that once you're addicted or tolerant to opiates that your brain recognizes what's happening once you take it again... It's interesting, I don't fully understand it and I don't think anyone really does.  




 Yeah, but your body was still quite familiar with opiates.  




 Then no, there was no build up of MDMA, and even if there was "build up", it would not even be close to enough to get high.  




 They inject into their feet, not their toes, so the doctors made a massive mistake there. I'm the same way, I've had nurses poke holes all over me at the same time trying to find a vein, and I think one poked it in a vein so much she collapsed the vein, or at least damaged it.  




 Why would they even say, "in his toes", I've never heard of a heroin addict injecting into their toes.  




 Lol, have fun fucking your seeds.  




 If you take them all at once? That could be potentially fatal, especially mixing Oxycodone and Morphine at the same times.  




 Being addicted to a drug isn't fun. Having to NEED a substance in your body as if it's food or water is soul crushing. It could take you years and years and years until the addiction finally ruins you and everything around you is gone, and then, you'll probably get help but because the substance had/has such a massive grip on you, what's stopping you going back when things get a little tough? Nothing, unless you have something or someone that keeps you going.

When you're addicted to something (Opiates for me) even if it's ruined everything in your life and you finally get help, you can still (and probably will) relapse a few times into that same thing, that destroyed you.  




 When was the last time you took MDMA when this happened? 




 There's mushrooms and various research chemicals, but that's about it when it comes to psychedelics IME. Meth is extremely neurotoxic same with Cocaine, Dexedrine and Adderall, Ritalin etc. They literally damage your brain, but not only that, they damage the shit out of your heart if you do it long enough. While opiates, don't damage organs at all, the biggest risk from using an opiate is severe repository depression and stopping breathing. 

It's extremely easy to get E here too, but I've just not been involved in that scene in particular yet. I've never tried nitrous but I'm sure it'll cross my path, either medically or just recreationally. DMT is something I wanna try but it's not easy to get here I don't think, the easiest psychedelic to get is shrooms. 

The drugs I have most exp. with are Opiates and Stimulants. The funny thing is, the Amphetamine I've done was from the street, Amphetamine Paste (Oral). The few times I've got it though it's never really hit me as hard as say, Ritalin, for some reason, but Ritalin is said to be the pharmaceutical cocaine.  




 It comes from Afghanistan (the street stuff), but I've heard lately that we grow our own poppy plants for our pharmaceutical stuff, especially the pharma diamorphine. Morphine and Codeine is probably what I will stick with forever because my tolerance never seems to go too high, even after a year and a bit of pretty much non stop abuse. It probably did boost tourism in Glasgow, but it's funny because the movie and book are set in Edinburgh.  

The DHC here the 30mg (per pill) is basically our hydrocodone, and some people say it's better than hydro, and I use that sometimes because it just lasts a lot longer, and feels kinda like dihydromorphine. 


The weirdest thing about my drug history is that I started off abusing stimulants, especially high doses of snorted Ritalin (which will most likely fry your brain if you binge on that stuff for more than a week), and Amphetamine a few times, then basically I saw some codeine 30mg (per pill) and started off abusing Morphine and other kinds of opiates from there. 

Btw, I've only tried Tamazepam 20mg (for sleep during WD), Valium and some Librium I found that was quite old. What's the Valium like for you on a recreational point of view? They never seemed to do much for me. 
 




 I love trainspotting, you can't be Scottish and not have watched/read trainspotting. Also, I can read Scots, I'm from Scotland lol. Yeah, I read it just there because you posted it on this thread, everything said in trainspotting is spot on about heroin, and it really shows the problem with heroin in Scotland. I can literally go down to the local store which is 2-5 mins away walking and see at least 1 to 5 heroin addicts, it's stupidly easy to get heroin here. 

This is my favourite "quote" from the movie: "People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored. But what they forget is the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pissed. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit." 




 Looks like photoshop to me. 

Note: Sarcasm is fun. 




 I had undiagnosed chronic pain, especially really bad headaches (which was the thing I had the longest) which basically felt like my brain exploding  but nothing showed on an MRI or Spinal Tap, and recently I've been having really bad pain in my lower back, tailbone and legs. I had nothing prescribed and didn't even know what an opiate really was back then, so I saw some tramadol and codeine 30s in my cabinet and took some and it made me feel good while taking away all pain. I've not had a headache while on opiates but when off them, it's extremely painful and nothing else solves them. 

Pain sucks bro, especially persistent pain and some doctors won't even prescribe chronic opiates for longer than a few years, when someone might need them for basically ever. 

I've always heard opiate addicts quit for 15-20-30 years and still relapsing and sometimes dying even, opiates have a weird, sometimes life long grip on someone, especially someone with pain. 

Why don't you get a suboxone doc or whatever once you want to quit? 

tl;dr: I started using for pain and recreation at the same time basically.  




 Whatever I can get my hands on really, usually 210-240mg codeine a day and/or 30-100 mg of morphine (depending on ROA), and sometimes 180-210 mg of DHC, which is said to be equivalent to hydrocodone if not better.

A 500mg a day of oxy would've fucked me so hard.

I've only been an "addict" for a year and a few months. You? (If you don't mind answering how long you've been taking opiates). 

Edit: I believe I'm an extensive metaboliser of codeine basically. Living in Scotland, I could easily go and get heroin in about 5 mins, thank god I haven't done that... Yet.  




 Diamorphine is just a short way of saying diacetylmorphine, and yes, the UK does use pharma grade heroin in a hospital setting. I've also seen morphine liquid suspension here, my next door neighbour had some of it when he was dying sadly of cancer. 

Yeah in America you get straight up Oxymorphone, 

Edit: Diamorphine and Diacetylmorphine are both heroin, diamorphine is just a short version of saying diacetylmorphine.  




 They are, but the black market for the Rx opiates aren't here and some drugs don't get prescribed (eg. hydrocodone) but others do like, Oxy, DHC, Diamorphine (in some cases). But the black market for the Rx's don't really exist apart from benzos. 

Also, before they prescribe oxy they usually prescribe morphine pills or liquid.  




 Oxymorphone is a lot stronger than oxycodone because it's the straight drug in your system, 15mg of oxycodone isn't 15mg of oxymorphone, it's just that one of the metabolites of oxycodone is oxymorphone, you follow me? Btw, oxycodone isn't a "pro drug" it just has oxymorphone metabolites. 

I live in the UK and have never heard of anyone being prescribe oxyMORPHONE but oxycodone is quite common for chronic pain. Does Australia not use diamorphine (in a hospital setting or on prescription for terminally ill, usually cancer, patients) like here in the UK? Because I thought I heard someone that you guys do use it, but I'm probably extremely mistaken.  




 Yep, heroin is basically a bullet train going to the brain and once it's there it converts into morphine. Not all opiates convert into morphine though, for example oxycodone and hydrocodone convert into oxymorphone and hydromorphone.  




 You get Oxy, DHC (which some say is better than hydrocodone) and various other opiates in the UK (Including diamorphine in a hospital setting). 




 No problem. 

I've always liked codeine and morphine better than almost any other opiate. People always hate on codeine because they "don't feel anything" but there's multiple factors into why you wouldn't feel much and one of the main reasons is the lack of the (or lowered function) enzyme needed to make CodeineMorphine. 




 Codeine is a pro drug, so basically in order for it to work it needs to be converted/metabolised in the liver by an enzyme called CYP2D6, some people either lack this COMPLETELY or the function of it is basically nil, therefore they can't convert it into morphine as much or at all.

This will kinda explain it a little: http://gyazo.com/5c16983af33c7ce3663fd3804b7e6448 




 IVing things, if done correctly with good techniques, can be really safe (of course not as safe as taking a pill, snorting normally or any other method that doesn't require much technique). Keep in mind also that heroin addicts for example pretty much need to move on to IV because once your tolerance gets stupidly high, smoking, snorting or whatever just doesn't cut it any more and it gets insanely pricey. IVing heroin is cheaper because you need less.  




 Codeine for me is quite good, you have to realize that maybe you're just an ultra poor metaboliser, or just a bad metaboliser.

I for one know that I'm a very good, maybe even ultra rapid metaboliser... Hate it when people bash on codeine. 




 Good luck, opportunities like this should always be seized.  




 I take it you're giving up opiates? If so, good luck bro, see you on the other side one day.  




 Ritalin (Methylphenidate) is what I'm more experienced with, coke costs too much for all that hassle imo.  




 Pretty in pink bro. 




 Methylphenidate makes me crave it so much I redose stupidly high doses until it's all gone.
