 I believe there are thousands, maybe millions of people who you could be extremely happy with and consider them your "soulmate". You may find a "soulmate" but keep in mind there are lots and lots of others who could make you as happy, or even happier than yours. You're with yours mainly because of where you live and have been to.  




 Maybe a cologne that isn't available in Europe (the new Old Spice ones, for example, aren't available here in Europe).  




 Avoiding to borrow things to people. I'm sure everyone would say I'm selfish, but I'm not lending you my expensive smartphone so you can drop it or check my personal text messages.  




 Girls with blue eyes. 




 English. I didn't like it as I didn't understand it, and the fact most PC games and movies were in English didn't help. Now I prefer it over my first language ^^ 




 "Why am I so dark when the rest of your body is white" 




 Same thing with iPhones
-*grabs popcorn*- 




 Who's Razor1911's cracker in real life. 




 I've cracked a few software protections. 




 How he always tries to please me and my sister, despite the fact he doesn't make that much money and rarely gets anything new to himself. 




 I'm from Portugal, and it's hard to find something I like here. We've got beaches, (usually) sunny weather and a cuisine that pleases many foreigners, but unfortunately I don't like any of that. I'd much rather life in a cold, snowy place like the Scandinavian countries or Canada. Oh well, maybe one day :)  




 Back when I first got Internet on my computer, I was infected by several trojans. One of them was a fake antivirus software which claimed it could disinfect my PC if I purchased it. I decided to format the PC instead. Ha, bad old times :) 




 I wish they had been more strict about my behavior. I was a stupid "rebel" during Elementary school, without realizing it at the time. I also was rude to many adults then. My parent's punished me but it wasn't enough. Is that a weird thing to say? 




 When I was a kid, I ran to the road not knowing there was a car passing. My neighbor actually closed her eyes as she thought I was gonna be ran over. 
The other time was also when I was a kid, my mom was about to give me some medicine that was made for adults and could potentially kill me. Thankfully, she always reads the whole paper that came with it, and returned it to the pharmacy, where it had been recommended. The pharmacist got really nervous and apologized a lot. 




 Not being down-to-earth. 




 Change BF4 servers' maximum ping to 20ms. 




 Don't feel too bad about that, man. I also have the "chest hole" thing, although it's not THAT bad, and so does a popular friend of mine. In the locker room once in a while other guys have fun poking at them (no homo) :p 




 Man, there's gotta be a great story behind that. 




 When my puberty began I didn't know I had to wear deodorant (most people my age already did), so...  




 I went to the bathroom and there was a green rag on the bottom of my shower. After looking at it, I get progressively scared and eventually wake up. WTF. 




 People who complain about how they have bad grades because of their teachers. There are cases when teachers are more demanding and harder on students, but in most cases they don't have good grades because they don't work for it, or their studying method needs optimization. I'm not that smart, people always seem to figure out how to solve math problems before I do and store more information than I am able to, but I usually have either the same or better grades than them, because I study more and harder than them. 




 Make all states allow guns and abortion, throttle non-white immigration and make sure there are more people speaking English rather than Spanish. 




 Multiculturalism. 




 Being pretty outside (cute face, blue eyes are a huge plus for me) and being honest, sweet and polite.  




 Run to the electronics store and steal all the big-ass TVs, 700$ smartphones and consoles I possibly could. 




 lel u dont kno mah stori, u dont kno me et all, dunt judje me 




 Counter Strike (game) and Game of Thrones (TV series). Nearly everyone I know loves them but I prefer Battlefield and TV series which plot occurs in the current days. 




 The last episode of "Lost". 




 What happened after that? 




 I've cracked a few software products. It's not worth mentioning to anyone in real life as people have no interest in it. 




 My hair is thick and it has two colors: black and light brown. Some people think I dye my hair, others think I spilled hydrogen peroxide on it :p 




 Post pics please :)
Are they blue? 




 Damn Desmond, forgot to push the button :/ 




 Yeah, sure looks like it :/ 
























 The countries with the highest percentages of white people tend to be the most developed and have better quality of life and gender equality. 




 Are you Dick Cheney? 




 I live in Portugal and I've never seen actual snow in real life. Scandinavians are so lucky :/ 




 Cock-a-doodle-doo

 "I'm sure Battlefield.4-RELOADED is a virus" 




 And then you found out it was on ThePirateBay? :P 









 The Internet as we now know it. I find it amazing we can send a message to the other side of the world in less than 1 second, store thousands and thousands of photos when we once need countless albums... 




 Visiting London for 6 days with my classmates/friends. It'll be next year, and of course I'm going. 




 Would people in Sweden consider someone white if they have black hair, dark brown eyes and slightly tanned skin? 




 CyberGhost is great as well, and they offer a free version. Premium is worth it, though. 




 Most brands are worth the money unless they're incredibly overpriced (like Apple, for instance). Some generic brands are good enough, but you never have the guarantee you're getting a quality product. Two things from these brands you should avoid are shower gel and toothpaste. 




 If so, tell me a bit about your experience. I'm a newbie that cracks simple programs for entertainment. 




 Ignite. 




 North 




 Crysis 3. I enjoyed the alpha/beta multiplayer, so I bought the full game. 1st mistake was buying it on a local retail store instead of some online key store. 2nd mistake was buying it at all :) 




 My Portuguese teacher wanted my to help her make a PowerPoint presentation of some poems we were forced to write. I don't get paid anything in the first place, needless to say I refused :) 




 A friend's gameboy, when I was like 5 years old or so. I freaked out when I saw it stopped working. The guarantee wouldn't cover it, so my parents ended up paying either for the repairs or for a new one (can't remember). 




 They saved money on toilet paper to buy all that expensive cool stuff ^^ 




 I didn't win the "genetic lottery" at all. I have dark brown eyes, black hair, big nose, big lips considering that I'm white (or at least I think I am), wide teeth that have gone yellow-ish even though I never had teeth problems and always washed them, and tanned skin. I would love to have light blue eyes, small nose, normal-sized lips, normal white teeth and fair skin. The only thing I like is being tall, actually. 




 No. There are no real movies in 4k yet, many TV channels still broadcast in 720p and the price of a 4k TV is ridiculous. By the time 4k gets popular, they will be 1/2 or 1/3 of their current price. As someone suggested, a 4k monitor might make a difference, though. 4k gaming is great, and a huge monitor can be great if you usually have many windows opened. 




 Wait a day before spending money on something you've just seen and are really excited about. I guarantee that in many cases the "excitement" just goes away and you save some money. 




 I never quite knew how to socialize, specially with people I didn't know. The older ones in the parties always found something to make fun of me, and I was never seen as an equal to other people in the party. 




 Just the way I style it, I guess. 




 Programming 




 Every single one from my friends.  




 Sardines. 




 XVIDEOS 




 MOIST MOIST MOIST MOIST MOIST MOIST MOIST 




 I have this memory of looking up in crib and seeing those crib toys. Probably a fake memory though. 




 Besides of the basic info about yourself, try to memorize the names of new people you just met. If you meet them again, they'll feel nice as they were remembered, and if you need anything from them you're more likely to get it. 




 Gravity. It was so boring and pointless (in my opinion). If there are guys who like it, I recommend checking their testosterone levels. 




 Meeting a tourist girl around my age. I create various scenarios and daydream.   




 I hate them, I'd much rather date a flat chick. Having fake breasts means you're not confident about yourself to the point you wanna "get a masK".
