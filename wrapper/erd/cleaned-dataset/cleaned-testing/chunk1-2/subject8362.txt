 Oh... She laughed hysterically after I did some explaining.  




 How is this funny? 




 A few years back, my friend and I were walking through Target and they had some of these up. She literally got super pissed off that they would make something so dumb and useless and thought they were for cats or some other small animal. I had to explain that they were for display purpose only and not for actual use. She felt pretty dumb. It was awesome. I make fun of her any time we come across anything miniature. To her credit, she was a super stoner back then.  




 Yep... I am a parent of three little girls. I would never pull this.  I want to punch most parents nowadays! 




 I laugh harder and harder every time I watch it. 




 OP must not have kids. I would rather wait an extra 10 minutes in the car than get all of my kids out of the car and have to corral them while in the restaurant. Drive through ANYTHING is a lifesaver when there are small children in the car.  




 That's an adorable baby. Also, a great idea for a baby shower game. 
























 Anyone else see a blonde Emma Stone? 




 Will someone please explain to me why shoes like the one the dude is wearing are in style? The are SO ugly. God, I'm getting old. 




 Yes! Nothing Bundt Cake. Sooo ridiculously good. Lemon flavor?  




 Possibly she's a poo-roctologist  




 What... What is it? 




 Wait... I shouldn't have drawn that on her face when she told me I could? 




 She told me I could.
