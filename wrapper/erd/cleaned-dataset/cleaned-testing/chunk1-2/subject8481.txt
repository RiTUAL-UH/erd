 I seriously doubt your bookmark's bar actually saves you any time.  Typing in a web address would be much faster than sifting through all that shit. 









 I don't know if the dude doing the spread eagle is actually tied on and about to get ripped apart or if he's just really fucking committed and a badass.  




 Mr. Freeman, it's an absolute pleasure having you here. Now tell me, would you rather fight 100 duck sized horses or one horse sized duck? Since, as God, you're the only one that can actually make it happen!

 It's not cancer, spiders or an abscessed tooth.  According to the dentist, the nerve on one of my molars died and then became infected.  So, the guy who said "blood and puss" is today's winner.  The only reason it ever got to this point is because I'm a Canadian that was traveling in the U.S. and couldn't see a dentist until I got home.  Thanks for your concern everyone, I'm on antibiotics and was even prescribed percocet for the pain so I'm high as a kite. 




 Thanks for the suggestion! 




 I agree that it doesn't belong in /r/askscience.  It is posted in /r/science. 









 I once sent a customer a text saying "goodnight beautiful" that was intended for my wife. He still greets me with "hello beautiful" every time he calls. 
























 Posting about it same day? Dude, too soon. Don't you have some family stuff to attend to? 




 Rocket salad?  I think they meant *roquette* salad, which is a kind of arugula.  I bet the Italian menu says roquette, but they just assumed rocket would be the English version. 




 "But I don't want to ride the elevator. " 




 The smiling man video from the other day. I had to change my pants after that one.  




 The company I work for was featured on How it's Made. The producers genuinely want to know how everything is built from beginning to end. We must have spoken with their writers a dozen times so that they had a deep understanding of the entire process. It was quite the experience.  




 I travel for work constantly, I'm actually writing this in an airport. My best tip is to eliminate checked baggage. This won't help if you're going on vacation, but I can't tell you how many time this has saved me. 

Tight connect? Your luggage doesn't get left behind. 

Want to grab an earlier connecting flight? The first thing they'll ask is if you have checked luggage. 

If you eliminate checked luggage, you can literally walk off the plane and to your car or hop into a cab without breaking stride. 

This goes without saying, but the airline can't lose your luggage if its with you. 

Note:  Please use only approved size luggage for carry on travel. If I see you on a flight with your whole life in multiple suitcases, I'll recline my seat into your lap as far as it can go.

 I literally just got wood.  




 I literally just teared up in awe. 




 People who board flights out of turn. When they call seating zone 3, if you're in zone 4, the agent at the counter should turn you away. But no one ever gets turned away! They just let them right on the plane like a reward for being bold enough to try or something. As a guy who travels for work, this drives me nuts.
