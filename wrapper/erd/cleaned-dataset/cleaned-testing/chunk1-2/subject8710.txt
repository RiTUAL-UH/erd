 well i had done it and i was looking for it and i found it kind of funny that they have optimized missions so much like the prelude of darkness mission and set ups for css and kyuubi naruto. and the optimizations for characters like fixing shigure and ten ten while keeping the initial idea for how they play 




 So im a fairly old player (started when the site started lost that account so tech around 2009ish) and i remember doing a certain mission a long time ago where you had to use every character to finish and it was just set up for sannin missions. and i wanted to know what it was and if anyone remembers what the requirements entailed ex. what chararcters were used naruto 10/10  




 I made a league video and i enjoyed playing creating and editing the video. So i have uploaded it to youtube i want to know what spots i can possibly improve on and such and i don't want to fall under a specific formula. anyway this is my video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P_jFc_XGaA 




 this reminds me of when i played banjo kazooie im not going to make a post about since i would feel like im ripping off your idea for this but maybe ill just make a video about it but really thanks for sharing this story reminds me of the days as a kid growing up with the better systems hope you can find some nostalgia again some day its the greatest feeling in the world to relive your past  





























 well both are amazing in their own respects however your going to end up being forced to read the manga. not that its bad i love the manga 









 of all the champions in league i only have four left and seeing as i don't care to extremly about which ones i get i thought i would ask here for who i should buy my options are
Varus
Zyra
Galio
Kogma
if you can describe a champion well enough to where its almost like what choice to i have to buy them then ill probably instantly buy them instead of waiting for tahm kench (seeing as i buy the bundles anyway)
