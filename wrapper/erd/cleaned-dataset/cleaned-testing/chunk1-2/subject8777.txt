 I dont always hit a women, but when I do I make sure I knock her to the floor no questions asked 




 Looks like a classy establishment y'all stayed at.. 




 I like how it says, "Our Goal, Totally Satisfied" because when I get my car towed that is the complete opposite of what I am.. 




 GOJO in the bottom right corner...they know whats really going on..

 well I appreciate you keeping me busy while I wait to do my rounds, but now I must go do them so I have to be on my way, but I am sure we will run into each other again on this here internet thing! 




 i wouldnt say people dont know what they want in life but it is more of a "how do i get there" problem, in my opinion 




 thats why you always gotta have your other shit to keep you sane, trust me if I just had this job, id kill myself bc overnights suck balls. But I know that this is just a paycheck for me and the real fun happens once I get off! its all a matter of tolerance 




 oh well yea man ride the college train as long as you can, no point in fucking up school for minimum wage anyway. Everyone says find a job you love and get paid for it, but thats kind of bullshit in my mind. Find a job to survive and do the things you love because you love them, even if it doesnt pay.. 




 living the dream my friend, getting paid to troll haha...you are my age, why cant you find work? 




 to kill time during my overnight shift..ah win!
