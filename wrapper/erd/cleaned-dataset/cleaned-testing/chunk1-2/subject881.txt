 *nelsonvoice*: Ha Ha! 




 It isn't. Commercially available solar cells have an efficiency of 17 to 20 percent, so there is only one fifth of the energy going into electricity. This is even under laboratory conditions. Rawlemon indicates they already be able to achieve an efficiency of more than 50 percent with the glass ball collectors right now. On a squarefoot photovoltaic surface, the prototypes already produces as much electricity as conventional systems generate with a much bigger surface - they are four times as effective.

 They have colected the money on indiegogo and start production soon: http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/rawlemon-solar-devices

 Then I will check back in a year or so. I think they will lead a multinational concern at this time.
 




 Thanks for the info! Do they ship to germany? :-D 




 Nice! Are they sold as magnets? For my fridge. 




 This is awesome! Some pictures remind me of a fairy tale. I can't put my finger on it but some affect me deeply. 




 As far as i know, it has been a study only. With no running engine. But here is the concept Video: http://youtu.be/5Nrk1p-TiWk 




 Ha ha, this looks so german! Am i right? But not bad anyway 




 FYI, it's the Shavit electric superbike. It is a final graduation project of an industrial designer from Shenkar college of design and engineering in Israel. The objective of his project is to design the ultimate everyday sportbike. This electric superbike has been designed with unique adjustable riding position system.  




 No, it's marvelicious! 




 With a view to her boobs, it's not completly before. But she looks better in these days for sure

 Not bad for a Smartphone. Was it a Sony? Which one? 




 Perfect focus! I like this 'glow' in her hair. 




 Is she in the Guinness Book for the longest legs yet? 




 Cool. (Double word sense) 




 Well, looks like a robot face.

 From the bar to the bedroom I'm swimming in the neon 

Lighted pictures of a redhead, plasticoated hot on 

And sometimes when that mirror shows 

The smile of disbelief 

Stained signature of nightmares 

They're stolen by the thief 

I'm back on the borderline 

Yes I'm back on the borderline 
 




 And everybody like: 'yeah!'

Pro tip: read the first half oft the first book and the last half of the last. Thats enough (if you habe to read it anyway)

 One factor is that the Senate thought Caesar wanted to be king and all powerful, the evidence for this is that 'He was happy to be treated like a God' and that 'From that time on Rumours spread that he wanted to be king'.

Another reason was because the Senate thought he was too popular, the evidence for this is that 'Caesar was liked by all the other Generals and 'He led the Army on expeditions that no other General would even dare to consider'. Also 'He was their leader, their idol, the one they were aspired to please.' This links to the paragraph above because he was so popular that many people wanted him to be king.

One other factor for his murder is that the Senate were afraid of his military power; the evidence for this is that 'He was undefeated in battle and that he was respected by the other entire Generals'. In addition to this, one of the army's brave men came forward and said 'He was the greatest warrior of all time, why would any soldier wish to have him dead? He was the bravest man I knew and I don't think that there's a braver man all over the world.' This links to the paragraph above because the senate were afraid of him due to the fact that most people loved him.

The most important reason why the Senate murdered Julius Caesar was because Caesar ignored the wishes of the senate; the evidence to this is that 'They had never forgiven him for entering Rome against their wishes'. Also, Caesar ignored their wishes because some senators hated him. Furthermore, a young woman aged 27 stated 'I am so glad that he ignored the senate's wishes for him not entering Rome because if it wasn't for him the army would not have enough courage or hope to go any further. I couldn't thank him enough for being an amazing General and he will be sorely missed over all of Rome.'

Just before Caesar went to the Senate his wife warned him and asked him not to go but he refused not to go, she said this 'You mustn't go! I fear that something bad is going to happen, I sense a death will occur tonight! Please don't go, I'm begging you'. 




 Wow! I found the long lost 4th face expression from Nicolas Cage!

  If you are watching naked people in cold weather fart on a regular basis, I assume you would see something.

Just tried to google something like that (video:naked people farting in cold weather). I was not successful. You are wrong as long you are not proofing you're right. 




 Well, in this case it would be possible to see a "wet" fart. But i never did. 




 It's a myth. Joints produce that crack when bubbles burst in the fluid surrounding the joint.

Joints are the meeting points of two separatebones, held together and in place by connective tissues and ligaments. All of the joints in our bodies are surrounded by synovial fluid, a thick, clear liquid. When you stretch or bend your finger to pop the knuckle, you're causing the bones of the joint to pull apart. As they do, the connective tissue capsule that surrounds the joint is stretched. By stretching this capsule, you increase its volume. And as we know from chemistry class, with an increase in volume comes a decrease in pressure. So as the pressure of the synovial fluid drops, gases dissolved in the fluid become less soluble, forming bubbles through a process calledcavitation. When the joint is stretched far enough, the pressure in the capsule drops so low that these bubbles burst, producing the pop that we associate with knuckle cracking.

It takes about 25 to 30 minutes for the gas to redissolve into the joint fluid. During this period of time, your knuckles won't crack. Once the gas is redissolved, cavitation is once again possible, and you can start popping your knuckles again.  

[ The common claim that cracking one's knuckles causesarthritisappears unsupported.]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_joints#Effects)

 




 This is a question bothering me a long time. I mean, it's body temperatered air in both cases. 














 
Quote from Wikipedia:

BASIC(anacronymforBeginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a family ofgeneral-purpose,high-level programming languageswhose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use.

In 1964,John G. KemenyandThomas E. Kurtzdesigned the original BASIC language atDartmouth Collegein New Hampshire. They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers. At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing custom software, which was something onlyscientistsandmathematicianstended to learn how to use.
