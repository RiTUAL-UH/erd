 IT'S WHAT I REMEMBER WALT!! 




 I did. Scroll down. 




 Walter, have you ever drank shots of liquid cocaine and Jack Daniels? 
Walt, it was closing time and when closing time happens, legs open.... 




 Da fuck? 




 I agree. I dropped the book when I glanced at the cover and said "What the fuck?" really loud.
Yeah, I took the pic when I dropped it. Someone placed it in the Sci-Fi aisle. 




 What is your impression of the cover art? 




 I fucked a fat chick and didn't know until the next day. Woke up naked in the bed, used the phone on her night stand to call friend, message on phone said "Dial 1 and area code for the number you are dialing", jump up, find phone book from Kansas. 
I live in Tennessee. 




 Long story short : It all started with a bookshelf and naked pics of them both. 




 That is weird as fuck.  




 Says the guy who posts on /r/sexyabortions

 Idea I had a few years ago that crossed my mind. See, you know how DC always fucks up the Archie superhero universe? 
I had this crazy thought about rebooting Archie Comics into a superhero universe.
Riverdale? Big as New York? Archie Andrews?
Well, he is the Fly. The Golden Age,Silver Age,etc. All of the past Crusaders, Shield,Blue Ribbon Comics stuff has happened, but rebooting Archie would have him on par with Spider-Man as the Fly (the rookie superhuman dealing with experienced heroes).

 So anyone whos been on the /v/ board at 4chan. probably knows about Mr. Bones Wild Ride. For those who dont, it was a ride someone made for Roller Coaster Tycoon. It was one of those really slow motor car rides but with a twist. It had 30,696 feet of track and a ride time of 70 real time minutes, around four years ingame time. In addition there were those props of the skeleton holding out his top hat scattered around here and there, as if to mock the customers. Needless to say, there were a lot of passengers screaming I WANT TO GET OFF MR. BONES WILD RIDE!
Now heres where things get really good. Once the ride came to a stop, the passengers found themselves on a long path that took about 2 hours to traverse. Once they reached the end, they found themselves facing a sign that read Mr. Bones says: The ride never ends!
The path lead straight back to the entrance of Mr. Bones Wild Ride. There was nowhere else to go. In other words, they were fucked. Needless to say this gained a lot of popularity on /v/ and people started making their own Mr. Bones Wild Ride. I was one of them and made a version with the ghost train ride. You know the one thats usually a huge death trap. It didnt last as long as the original but it did have a twist. Near the end it launched the cars into a small shed with a sign on the side that said Enjoy your stay! I killed about 20 people with that ride and laughed my ass off as they each went one by one to their graves.
Fast forward a few weeks and I was in Busch Gardens on vacation. I was wandering around trying to decide what to ride. Thats when I noticed a ride that hadnt been there the last time I visited. It was weird because it had never been advertised and there was nothing on the map about it. I figured what the hell and got in line.
Surprisingly the line wasnt very long. I only waited about 10 minutes to get on. It was one of those motor car rides which is kind of weird because they already had one elsewhere in the park. Why would they open up a second one? After buckling in I looked up ahead and froze. There was a giant skeleton up ahead tipping a hat to me with a sign over his head. No I whispered. The sign read Mr. Bones Wild Ride.
I struggled with my restraints but they wouldnt come off. I begged the employee contolling the ride to help and that I had changed my mind but he ignored me. My car started moving and I screamed in terror. Up ahead the track stretched on for what seemed like forever. I WANT TO GET OFF MR. BONES WILD RIDE!

  Barkley: Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden! 

On November 28, 2012 Tales of Game's announced the game's sequel, The Magical Realms of Tr na ng: Escape from Necron 7  Revenge of Cuchulainn: The Official Game of the Movie  Chapter 2 of the Hoopz Barkley SaGa, with a Kickstarter campaign to help fund it. The campaign ended on December 28, 2012, and raised $120,335.

While the sequel will retain the original's self-aware tone, all of the artwork is being created from scratch to avoid copyright issues.

  also wouldn't be an old image that this reporter simply doesn't recognize. Ted Kord has only ever shared a single panel with this version of Booster Gold before -- in Futures End: Booster Gold. That issue saw Booster careening out of control through DC's Multiverse, before ending up "home" in the pre-Flashpoint DC Universe. The armored costume -- generally depicted with an A.R.G.U.S. emblem on it, although not here -- first appeared in the Justice League International Annual #1 in the New 52, meaning that Ted Kord was not a superhero and shared no history with Booster Gold when that look debuted.

It's likely that this Booster Gold is the same one who, in a different uniform, lent guidance and occasional surreptitious assitance to his younger self and his son Rip Hunter during Booster Gold Volume 2. That "Older Booster" was last seen just before Flashpoint during the Time Masters: Vanishing Point miniseries tied to the Return of Bruce Wayne event. That version of Booster would have been the one whose younger self worked extensively with Blue Beetle on the JLI and later the Justice League America.

Currently, the pair of old friends and former Justice Leaguers are working together in Justice League 3000...but that doesn't take place in the "regular" DC Universe, but instead in a similar universe where Keith Giffen and J.M. DeMatteis' humor-tinged, nostalgic take on the Justice League International is the standard. That world is a version of the pre-New 52 DC Universe, but one in which (among other things) Ralph Dibny isn't dead and Max Lord never went evil.
