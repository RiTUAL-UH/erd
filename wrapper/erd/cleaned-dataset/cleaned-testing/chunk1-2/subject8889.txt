 origin story

you were born to be a super hero 




 "fear of shitting in public places"

So I can safely assume you're a guy? 




 I have observed many love triangles among my birds throughout the years, involving yelling at each other and fighting over the shared object of affection, but one triangle in particular was especially interesting.

Two male Parakeets (budgies), Jupiter and Misty, were romantically involved with a female parakeet, Aqua, and had also occasionally been romantically involved with each other.  This was an interesting bisexual love triangle, where one day you'd see Aqua (the female) with one of the boys, another day with the other, and another day the boys would be on each other; and the next day they'd be physically fighting over her.

It was crazy and intensely dramatic. 




 People who have multiple pets, breed animals, have farms, etc.  What is the most interesting relationship you've observed your pets/animals getting into? 




 The pen with which he'd sealed his fate; signing away his freedom, and effectively, his sanity.  He had, in his frustration, clicked it three times in quick succession, summoning this eerie visitor in the night. 
 




 I made it to my desk, only to find my computer already logged in, and my emails already answered.  No one else could have done this.  The only explanation was that I'd already been there.  I went to the bathroom, only to find that I no longer felt like I had to go.  I exited the stall just in time to see my back exiting the door.  I rushed out of the bathroom, only to find the figure had been lost in the large office hustle and bustle.  Thoroughly disturbed, I made my way back to my desk.  My coffee had already been drunk, and my report already written, with exactly what I was going to say.  I saw the me-like figure again out of the corner of my eye, a quick flash in the commotion, heading for the door to the stairwell.  I booked it for the door and took the steps two at a time.  Arriving in the parking garage, I heard a car door slam and an engine roar.  I ducked behind a black sedan just in time to see myself, driving my car out into the street, shadows flickering around it with static interference.  I began to suspect that I was seeing myself a few hours into the future; living two timelines simultaneously. 




 I lived with my ex for 2 and a half years.  We got officially engaged in the middle of that.  (To put it short and simply, I left because he stopped appreciating me and it seemed like I was the only one trying to make things work, and I gradually became more of a maid than an girlfriend.)

I'm not saying by any means that this will happen to you.  What I'm saying is that I agree with the others that you should live with him, because otherwise you won't know what it's like to live with him before you commit.  You could be perfect going out and basically being close friends, but you might find that you simply cannot live with him.  Just note, if you are always doing what he wants to do, and never what you want to do, that is a red flag.

To address the family problems.  He was white and I am not.  I was the successful one, he was not. His family loved me though.  My parents never liked him (we had already been together three years before I moved in with him).  They also believe the only acceptable way for a female to leave home is to go to school or get married.  

It took about a year for them to come to terms with the fact that I was not (at the time) going to move back no matter how much they implored me to.  This is around the time my dad accepted him as "part of the family."

This is also around the time that I started going places with my parents, like to church on Sundays and stuff.  They'd pick me up and bring me back.  

About 6 months later they became ok with including my ex.  So we'd all go on family outings.  

Well things at home (with him) had gradually gotten sour (as previously detailed), and so eventually, when I got tired of trying to make it work, one Sunday night, I asked my parents if I could move back in with them, and the rest is history.

TL/DR (Case in Point):  PLEASE DO live with him or you may not know what you're getting into.  Good or bad, you need to find out before you complicate things further legally, emotionally, and with family. 

Edit: replaced some unnecessary details with a generic line of advice. 




 I am in grad school, An American in England, and this is my first time truly on my own (I used to live with my ex).  I have been here for over a month, and I have not felt homesick yet.  I asked a friend if that was weird, and she said it's normal for your first time on your own, presumably because it is so liberating. 

I get lonely sometimes though.  I surround myself with my friends, including skyping with my friends from back home when I am alone in my dorm room.  

So, surround your self with good friends and have fun!

Take full advantage of the experience.
That's my advice. 




 yes, and I kid you not, when I was in my early teens, I looked like I was in my early 20's (the reverse is true now, but I digress).  
I was in the store with my dad and my (then) baby brother; my mom was at work.  An employee approached me trying to "sell" me on a credit card, and she thought my dad was my husband and my brother was my son.  




 I have received nice compliments from both guys and girls at various times, but there is one compliment that I will never forget, because no one else has ever said anything like this about me, and because it happened at an embarrassing time.  
It was freshman year of high school (about 8 years ago now),  in gym class, we were doing free play and a friend (whom I had a crush on) and I were kicking a soccer ball back and forth.  He kicked it to me, and when I went to kick it, I was either too ambitious or it slipped under my foot just right, and I slipped and fell into a seated position flat on my bottom.  I was so embarrassed.  

But do you know what he said to me?
"I've never seen anyone fall so gracefully."
No one else has ever called me "graceful." 
I can be quite clumsy at times, so I will never forget that.  




 well, as long as each time isn't a monumental life-changing event, you should have no problem :p 




 you can be so tied to someone mentally/emotionally so sense when something important or serious happens.  Like when you just *know* something is wrong.   




 it will start happening again if you get adequate sleep 




 yes, all the time.  Everyone has them occasionally.  dreams are metaphors for/ based on the things that we are thinking about or have subconsciously picked up on during the day  / things we don't want to admit. 

To be more specific, my most recent one was, interrupting the middle of a dream's usual craziness, I wound up at WalMart with my mom to return a pack of socks.
When I woke up in the morning, guess what we had to go do?  
now, in the dream, the socks were white.  The real ones were black.  But still. 




 making them do the drug they were up against while hammered could kill them.  that part needs to be taken out 




 concept is good, but I don't agree with your categories.  Why is Islamist up there with political ideologies?  It is a Religion.  If you want to include Theocratic governments, then perhaps your should include more than one type. 




 This may be cheating, but I would have a Perfect mansion, Pretzels, a Porche, Pet birds, Pretty clothes, Pistachio Ice Cream, Pear Cider, and Plenty of chocolate :) 




 that's a cultural thing.  Wet ones / baby wipes.  Use them 




 yes; I am on exchange in England and I tried them and they are so good I bought a jumbo pack.   




 That could be the "secret" she's taking to the grave.   




 I saw that video and read about this a few months ago.  That hotel actually has a whole history of strange events, and in the past was even known as a popular destination for those looking to commit suicide  




 Did anyone else think this was a woman until the "girlfriend" part? 









 I had a sore throat and an interview the next day, so I was concerned.  I was at my parents' house for dinner, so I asked for advice.

Me: what do I do if I wake up tomorrow and my voice is hoarse?

Dad: Just go  "neigh" 




 Don't you mean avian flew? 




 I will upload a picture to photobucket when I get home from work and link it here.  I designed it not around replacing all letters with different characters, but around replacing frequently used words with shorthanded symbols.  I did manage to put it in a chart in Excell, but I could not get the characters to save as a font. 




 I like the idea of another writing system.  I learned dwarvish runes from the hobbitt very easily, but I find American shorthand and the Dotsies to be impractical, because the characters are so similar in nature.  When the Dotsies are bunched up, they are hard to distinguish.
With notecard situations, I usually write really tiny, and abbreviate.  I developed my own system of shorthand as well.  I wrote out charts for it, but I ran into some hiccups trying to program a font so that I can type in it and share it with the world.  Kudos to the Dotsies inventor for being able to do that so well. 




 a couple of years ago I found a tiny frog like this once.  I tried to take it home with me.  I have an insect container that would have made a great home for him.  When we arrived, he was just fine.  I washed the container out and put water and grass in it.  I went to put him in it, and he was dead.  I looked it up and I guess his skin got too dry.  :( 




 I just found out that the secretary at the office downstairs is pregnant and had an ultrasound yesterday.  It's a boy.  She came up here and showed us the pictures.

That is so freaky. 




 I'd had a baby and he was smaller than my pinky (about as tall as the first two pieces of the pinky, and slightly skinnier than it).  I don't remember much about the middle of the dream except that I sort of ignored him and just fed him and gave him occasional attention at different points of the day (like you would a pet bird for instance).  Then at one point, in the evening, I thought, "it's been a couple of hours, he's probably hungry."  So I picked the baby up.  He was wrapped up in a gum wrapper with a tiny tortilla inside, as if he was a trident-sized taco bell burrito.  I was intending to breastfeed him, but nothing was coming.  Suddenly, my mom was sitting next to me and she said to let her do it (and I saw her dripping milk - agh!).  At that point mine started working, so I fed the baby.  It was really weird with him being so tiny.  He looked darker than he did before at this point in the dream.

Then I woke up.

Bit of bg for the curious: I am engaged, but not pregnant.  I have no children.

Might be because we recently got two new lovebirds. 




 this was my reaction to this thread )posted on tumblr b/c I hadn't joined reddit yet.  Just thought I'd share them here without going back through the whole thread and finding each comment that I was referring to. http://kineticpassion.tumblr.com/post/49332764629/peridexis-ocdplayer-sunwillswallow-dont 




 there's no telling if it was him or now; we can't verify who this guy really is, and who really cares?  It would matter if he was taking credit for something of at least a small importance, but this means nothing. 




 what an injustice.  Rape is rape.  Be it man or woman, done with body, objects, or mind.  Someone attempted to mind rape me once, but I mind kicked his ass.

I know this sounds like a joke, but I am serious. 




 it's just that you got used to it.  If you left for a few days and came back, you would smell it again. 




 I had the same thing happen with a vaccum cleaner that smelled like cat.  I spraed a Hawaian febreeze in it, and it never stopped smelling like a sickly sweet refuse.  
Fruity febreeze is just bad period.
Now there is a febreeze that smells like laundry detergent; that one is good on anything.

 I also thought Vogel would be the villan, because she was manipulative and appeared to be using Dexter as her next gimick.  
That "flat, dull, unrelatable" ness is also how I perceived Hannah when she first appeared.  Bringing her back in this season, as Dexter's supposed "true love," and having him leave Harrison with her, was just completely wrong.  Hannah had proved herself to be dangerous and untrustworthy.  Not just with the poisoning, but she was also obviously ill prepared to raise a child.  It feels like that story line was thrown in as a means of slashing all of the other loose ends and wrapping it up.

As far as the other characters are concerned, most of them were fabricated for the show; based on what you said, you'd probabl appreciate the books better.  I have yet to read them myself, but I hear that they are much darker, and that Deb dies in the first one, and Dexter keeps Brian alive.

The ending is completely illogical.  "I don't have a life in Miami anymore, and I'm depressed about Deb.  I could go overseas and be with my girlfriend and son, and have a fulfilling future, but I'm afraid I'll screw it up, so I'll just abandon them and rot in this cabin."  Like I said before, it feels like they rushed to tie it together.  They definitely did not stay true to the series or its characters. 




 A lot, frankly, but I want to focus on the last few episodes.  He made so many little mistakes that had huge consequences, because he started thinking with his heart more than his head, both of which are flawed to begin with.  The ending would have worked out so much better if...

...he let Hannah leave in that helicopter; he could have taken care of Daniel Vogel, and then decided, with a clearer head, if he really wanted to follow her, and once the heat died down, he would be free and clear to move on and have a life.  Debra would likely have lived as well, if Dexter was focused on Vogel (Saxon) and not distracted by being with Hannah and protecting her; he would have dealt with him sooner and Dr. Vogel could have lived also.

This one is not exactly Dexter's mistake, but had Hannah walked over and stopped Harrison from using the treadmill instead of just telling him and expecting him to listen, she would not have been seen with him at the ER and identified to the marshall.

If Dexter had not told Batista that he was leaving as early as he did, the marshall would have left Miami, as he had been about to do, and then he would not have heard about Dexter leaving and suspected that he was harboring Hannah.

Had Debra thought to move Hannah's purse out of sight before opening the door for the marshall, that would be one less suspison.

Had Dexter killed Saxon while he had him strapped down, Debra would be alive.

Once all of those poor choices were made, and Hannah had sedated the marshall and escaped, Dexter had no options.  The marshall would awake, and he had seen with his own eyes that Hannah was with Harrison, so Dexter would go down at the very least, as an accomplice.  Debra as dead; even if he could escape, he had very little will to do so.  I would have thought he'd want to live and be there for Harrison, but from the moment he brought Deb onto the Slice of Life, I suspected he wanted to kill himself.
I'm glad that it didn't end on that variation of him riding into the sunset (in this case, hurricane), but him being alive, and his son and love being out there somewhere, is probably much worse.

Also, do you think Dexter the lumberjack (or lumber-yard-worker) is a killer, or just some empty shell wasting away? 




 it is also partially b/c of him that the confrontation after Hank's death went so badly; he added more and more heat to the situation. 




 good to know that there are professionals who are paid serious money and devote years of study to miniscule household pests.  
not sure how specifically studying albino flies would benefit humans, but I guess people can get paid to study anything.  How do you land a job like that?
"Hey, I was wondering how the genes that make fruit flies albino affect their healing."
"Here's a grant, and some more money; go do tests to find out." 




 this happens regularly in my house.  enough said 
























 no, actually, but thanks for offering :)  I've been writing songs since middle school.  I'm in grad school now, though not for music.  I write   sing pop rock / alternative. 




 and I'm always happy to help a fellow student.  btw, I was curious, did you write the poem/lyrics?   If so, do you write songs too? 




 no problem; I was a little bashful to record it here in my dorm, even though I sing in here everyday :) 




 ok; here it is; I hope it helps! https://soundcloud.com/test_subject8889/sets/poem-recording-for-vocoder-in-5-parts 




 ok, I'm singing it btw.  I've recorded the first three parts, but in the last part, on the 4th and 5th lines, you have the repeated "the" at the end of the 4th line and the beginning of the 5th line.  So would you like it on the 4th or 5th line, because that affects the rhythm also.  thanks :) 




 oh, wow; I didn't notice it was two links.  sorry about that :) 




 Idk if you're still looking for recordings, but if so, where is the text of the poem? 




 I actually pulled it up yesterday.   I just opened more threads in more tabs than I could read yesterday. 




 Didn't find out about this until starting Grad school.  Used to do all the searching myself. :/

 thanks for the reminder.  My AP Music Theory teacher in HS told us about it, but I had since forgotten 




 Do you mean New York blended with North Carolina? 




 Raised in south by parents from the north.  so I would say my accent is neutrally American.  




 I grew up in the south, but my whole family is from NY (deets here http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yft7m/what_accent_do_you_have/cpc5zf7)

So, in the south they say I have a neutral accent, but in the north they say its southern.

But I do not say y'all.  I have always said "you guys" 




 same, just within America, and with Spanish  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yft7m/what_accent_do_you_have/cpc5zf7 




 Yeah, sometimes accents are clearcut and sometimes they are not so strong and are percieved differently by different groups; I would assume that is based on the comparison with their own accents.  I have a similar situation http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yft7m/what_accent_do_you_have/cpc5zf7 




 I was raised bilingual (English and Spanish).  I learned French in HS, but apparently I speak French with a Spanish accent.   




 I don't live on a border, but I know exactly what that's like: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yft7m/what_accent_do_you_have/cpc5zf7 




 This is actually a complicated question for me.

I grew up in the American South (North Carolina to be specific), but my parents grew up in New York (and we regularly visited the rest of the family up there).  So I learned to talk around ex New Yorkers.

So, in NC anyways, everyone says I have a neutral accent; after I give speeches, sometimes people tell me they like the sound of my voice.  So yeah.

One time though, my cousin, from Brooklyn, while in Brooklyn, said that I have a "thick southern accent;" and I told her that she has no idea what that is.  There are people in my town that I cannot understand a word they say, but I digress.

So to my relatives in NY, I have some degree of a southern accent.
In the actual south, where I am from, I have a neutral accent. 

I am currently studying in the UK.  I have a clearly American accent.  

Also, to complicate it more, I am hispanic; my parents are fluent, but given ESL, I have been gradually learning that I have been pronouncing some words in a spanish way. (like Acetominophen (Tylenol) is, in English, pronounced Ah See Toe Min Uh Fen, and I had been saying, Ah Ceh Toh Mean Oh Fen, as that was the only way I'd ever head it said, by my parents).

TL; DR:  Raised in NC by ex NY-ers; accent sounds neutral to southerners but sounds southern to northerners, with some spanish elements mixed in

 I don't read romance novels on principle, but I have a high amount of respect for John Green as a writer.  These are certainly more than just romance stories, tackling lots of complex issues.

Given that, I still have not read TFIOS because I am avoiding the disappointment I felt after reading Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants when it was so popular and I was in middle school. 

I had jumped on that bandwagon, and the ending just rubbed me the wrong way so much.  I would have rathered she dated the counselor or never slept with him at all.  

I know the gist of TFIOS, and have read the first chapter or so as an excerpt somewhere, but I don't think I want to read it and be disappointed by the inevitable tragedy or "oblivion" within.   




 I've never seen any of that either...maybe I'm just lucky too. 




 That some colleges have math course requirements to get in if you're transferring from community college.  So if you took AP's, make sure to follow up that admissions received your AP score report, because it gets delivered to a different record keeping department by default, so if admissions never sees it, you will not be shown as meeting the course requirements to get in, so you will be denied.   And if you go to the school to point out your APs and ask them to fix it, they will say its too late and just tell you to come back next year.

Sorry about the run-on; its past midnight and idc

Source: this happened to me, so I went to a school online (Southern New Hampshire University) and finished in just one more year.  I am now in grad school studying abroad. 




 here's the thing though; we were told this so much in high school.  BUT, if you're taking AP courses and dual-enrolled in college courses while in high school, and participating in clubs as well, when you do go to college it will be so much easier. 

They drilled into us how college is so much harder, and I am in grad school now and have only had one course that was in any way harder than my high school courses, and not really, I just didn't try.  

The pressure to succeed and the workload is triple for a high school junior or senior with APs and Extra Curriculars than it is for a college student.

Disclosure: My degrees are in Criminal Justice and Forensic Psychology; and the graduate program I am in is Political Science.
(These majors involve more essays than tests).

Second disclosure: I am the kind of person who doesn't study.  But I take extensive notes.  The act of writing something down makes me remember it.  




 Well I made it to the end of the first semester of Grad school before that happened to me... 




 some schools have a policy that you cannot check out a book from the library if it is a required textbook for a course you are enrolled in. 




 I was raised bilingual (english and spanish) , and I just realized this last year 




 I heard the same story from my French teacher in high school. 




 well we already know you're against it :)

But in all seriousness, neither Israel nor Palestine would want to give up territory to Hamas and allow them to form a "legitimate" state.

Palestine might be more willing to compromise on that, given that Hamas is already involved in their government, but I don't think Israel would be willing to make that concession.

 "This is a delicious burger; thanks"
"No problem"

"speaking of which" 




 "aww; what a cute baby! How old is he/she?" 




 "don't you have an interview in an hour?"
