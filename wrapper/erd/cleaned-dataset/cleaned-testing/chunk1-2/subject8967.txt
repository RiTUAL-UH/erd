 I go to college in PA, I live in Maryland when I'm not at school, and I plan to get involved in the campaign in PA and try to get others involved on my campus. 


































 Bernie a few days ago on NPR (these quotes are taken from an article written on The Hill):

 Talking about cultural divides in this country, you know, it is important for people in urban America to understand that families go out together and kids go out with their parents and they hunt and they enjoy the outdoors and that is a lifestyle that should not be condemned...if anyone thinks that gun control itself is going to solve the problem of violence in this country, you're terribly mistaken...so, obviously, we need strong, sensible gun control and I will support it. But some people think it's going to solve all of our problems. It is not."

Here is the article I am referring to:
