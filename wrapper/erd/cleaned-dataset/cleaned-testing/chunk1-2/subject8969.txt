 Hey, I think what you are doing is really cool, and I just recently bought the game (about two weeks before it became free) and wouldn't mind getting a free weapon/item. I normally play as sniper/medic, and sometimes heavy/spy.

Edit: Thank you so much, I really appreciate the strange sniper rifle! 
























 Happy coupon and 3 coal!
