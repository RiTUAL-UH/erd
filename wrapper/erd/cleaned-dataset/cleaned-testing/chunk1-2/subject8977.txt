 Its a good lesson for all our boys. Take it in stride and be humble...that's the attitude that got us our Smythe! 




 They hate us because we are a top house at our school. It's pretty funny. 




 We got a lot of positive feedback, even from our rival chapter! We still get the hate but, hell, with enough Yaks you might see a second video. 




 The reaction has been incredibly positive by all sorority women as well as our rival fraternity on campus! It's a good idea, just make sure it's executed well!   



















 Definitely a Blow Job shot...unless they're into that sort of thing. 




 No more farts!

 It's my honest belief that everyone is in some way, shape, or form a secret freak that needs a little bit of Jesus in their life. 




 Kill Bill! I've seen it maybe 20-30 times now.  









 When you're so excited about the movie and you watch it with your friends, but they have the most disinterested look on their faces.  




 Wow, I just read that comment too! 

I know everyone has a different situation, but I just came out to 160 of my fraternity brothers and was called, texted, and messaged from so many of them saying that they were proud of me and that they loved me!

 Well, at least your Mom didn't use your laptop one day only to find that you didn't catch that hidden gay porn pop-up window that pushes itself to the back of all of your open windows.

That was a fun conversation. 

 




 Coming out of the closet.  




 Pizza is the circle of life.  




 We're into old ladies. 




 I've never seen Goonies and now I'm too afraid to even ask to watch it. 









 It actually bums me out that people are taking this negatively. Sheesh man she's just trying to support us, not drag us out of the closets.  




 Does anyone know who this man is of when this was taken? He looks like a regular that comes into my restaurant!  




 The perfect bathroom for...some people. 




 TIL that people on reddit have bad teeth. 




 I just wanna pick your cheeks 




 "Thank you officer, I feel refreshed." 




 Pizza...pizza dat ass. ;)
