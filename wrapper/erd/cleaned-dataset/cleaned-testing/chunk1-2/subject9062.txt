 Exactly. They pop off here just like there - only here it's usually a suicide shooter rather than a suicide bomber. Between stranger massacres and the nuts who shoot their families, we have our own terrorism in the US - nearly

Fucking Stop This Madness. #notonemore


* mandatory background checks for ALL GUN SALES
* mandatory registration and annnual inspection of all guns to ensure they are kept safe and secured away from children
* hold gun owners accountable when their gun is used in a shooting; where did today's student get the gun? HOLD THAT PERSON RESPONSIBLE.

Cue the trailer trash yelling about the gub'mint in 5..4..3..2... 




 Arrest whoever owns the gun that the killer used. Until we do this, it will continue as an epidemic. **HOLD THESE FUCKERS ACCOUNTABLE.** 


* Register all guns. 
* Annual license renewals. 
* Annual gun inspections. 
* Mandatory laws about locking up unloaded weapons separate from ammo. 



















  OP is clearly lucky.  









 Hope so. After that shit at the Georgia courthouse you have to wonder, is this a bunch of insane hillbillies popping off day after day? If so, please fucking take their guns. This is bullshit. Killing cops and shoppers?? This is terrorism.

 Guns should be available at hinting and shooting ranges for use on the premed is. Aside from that we need tightly regulated ownership of guns with annual inspection and re-registration to ensure storage is secure and safe. This has gone past epidemic to daily terrorism. #notonemore 
























 Seemed like an awful lot of detail in that article for it not to have been tried yet - discussion and questions by the girls during questioning? I am not sure I've ever seen that before.  




 Agree with you. I don't understand the concept of having a law that starts at a given age (18), and then based on the crime, changing the law to fit the crime. What the fuck is up with that? 


































 The average Midwest redneck does, too.  




 I've long pondered whether those folks really exist in the wild, or if they're simply the paid talking heads who mock responsible, Eco-conservative people as minions of their corporate masters (oil/ coal/fracking). It's fairly obvious they are; these are the same character-lacking folks who, for a paycheck, would've sold out their brother-in-law to the SS. Or done any dirty work for any dirty master. They're terrorists when you consider that their "side" is pro-pollution and anti-environment. They are the enemy of humanity.  




 No. The folks who do that are the dregs of society. Historically speaking they're nothing. Their paycheck today only shows they're successful whores. Not successes.

 Absurd. It's not unpopular. It's wrong. Look at Australia. They had a mass shooting. They altered gun regulations. They stopped any future massacres. We've lost thousands this year alone in America to gun terrorism.  




 That and a registration and regulated gun ownership. When someone is known to be disturbed and dangerous, he should not be able to legally buy firearms and ammo.  




 No, it doesn't matter if we know the name of the shooter. What matters is that he was known to be totally unbalanced and disturbed, yet was able to legally buy a fuckload of guns and ammo, and then keep those even when cops checked on him after tips that he was going to go off. What the actual fuck? Stop letting crazy people buy and own guns. Period.  




 Right?? Had the cops been able to reference registered weapons, they'd have been able to seize them once the credible threat of violence had been reported to them. Instead they talked to the psycho and walked away, making it possible for him to assassinate innocent Americans. If we simply had registration similar to vehicle ownership requires, this would enable law enforcement to act appropriately and remove the weapons from the crazy fucks who post threats.  




 The cops were at a house. He'd been reported as a serious threat. Had we some way to regulate gun ownership like car ownership, those cops would have known he had a fuckload of guns and ammo in the house when they visited. The fact that this isn't the number one issue discussed after this gun terrorism is another bit if proof as to how powerful the weapons dealing NRA is.  




 What are you on about? The progressives I am familiar with are typically a-theistic and see misogyny where it exists.  




 It's not the fact that someone voting GOP would not like Obama, it's that by supporting the GOP, they are supporting misogyny, racist policies and bigoted, homophobic policies.  




 I'm a progressive and I don't think people should accept the over-simplified and incorrect notion that criticizing a culture = racism. Oppression of women is a problem around the globe. Noting it does not make someone a racist. That's a red herring thrown out by actual racists!  




 Incredibly disheartening. I'm afraid our racist bigots in the US will find allies in these euro nuts.  




 Not OP but guessing he was relating to the "I'm against the government I now serve within" sentiment. We have many far-right in the US who continually talk shit about government in general, the federal govt in specific, and then run for office within that very government. And then attempt to destroy it as we see with the GOP and the baggers.  




 In the US we are currently fucked, absolutely fucked, by the far-right so-called-small-government fuckers who are simply whores to lobbyists and corporations. They tell their followers that they are against the federal government, then they do everything they can to help big corporations and fuck over ordinary citizens. The two-face nature is dangerous, as are those who believe it.  




 It's very disheartening. As an American I incorrectly grant Europe an idealized identity of progressive and intellectual greatness. While it does exist, they have the same religious / racist / bigots we do.  




 Election turnouts in the US are horrible as well, letting the bigots and racists win here as well. Until people are compelled to vote like in Australia or simply become more responsible and do their citizen duty, I'm not sure how it will get better.  




 Is there some resurgence if the kkk lately or wtf?  




 Show some respect.  




 Sick shit. Hope he gets no votes.  




 Of course, this is all too familiar: a young aggrieved male, mentally disturbed, threatening othersespecially womenbut still able to get his hands on a high-capacity magazine of the variety used in so many other mass murders. This doesn't happen in any other high income country with the regularity it does here; in fact, it almost never happens in any of them.

But here, in the good ole US of A, weve allowed a group of rich, entitled thugs who run an operation fronting for arms dealersguys who represent a minority position on pretty much every issue having to do with reasonable regulation of firearms even among gun ownersto dictate our policies to cowardly, careerist politicians.

Bingo.  




 I'm curious why you think so.  




 There are people whose lives have been beyond devastated, chain reaction fucked up, by the actions of bank fraudsters. It's not surprising people would be this angry. I don't condone the violent approach but I get why someone would.  




 That's totally my counter top.  




 It really sounded like he should have been considered an immediate threat to those around him. Would that plus the warnings from his family to the sheriff Not warrant a search and seizure of weapons / loss of the right to have one? 




 Quote 6 is a huge deal. Why wasn't he searched for weapons if this was a known concern?? 




 Both kids were wealthy, clinically diagnosed to be disturbed, and able to acquire firearms. That's the one link we could break as a society. Stop crazy folks from owning and acquiring firearms. We must.  




 Where'd he get the gun??? 




 But they don't have the UsA's Lucy goosey lack of gun regulation.  




 Think harder. It's the fact that the NRA and congress repeatedly block laws that would keep firearms away from people proven to be emotionally disturbed like this fucker.  




 No, it's the sanest thing he could say. To blame a gun, maybe a stretch. But the reason that certifiable nutters like the shooter can GET guns is the NRA and their beholden in congress. Just fucking make people prove they are not crazy before buying lethal weapons. What is so fucking hard about that concept? Yet the NRA blocks research, encourages insane responses from the fringes of their already-radical members, and fans the flames of these mass shootings. Fuck. How can anyone see this suffering beautiful father, his life FUCKING RUINED by a proven-crazy fucker who's family contacted the sheriff for fucks sake, and who was still, still able to procure a gun!- and argue against blocking crazy folks from buying and owning firearms?

 No, it's just gun terrorism.  




 We do. Except guns. Time to start.  




 Nobody is going around spraying children with flying knives. However in the US we are sling people daily to gun terrorism. It's a plague we fight, despite trite trolls who claim cars kill people. In reality we license, inspect and keep a log of cars. If your car is stolen we can look up who has ever owned it, and trace via aerial number. That would be a great start to keeping track of the death toys.  




 Meanwhile in America...
[Detectives found 20 unsecured guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition throughout the home of the family of a 3-year-old boy who accidentally shot himself in the abdomen March 3, according to reports released last week.
The boy, who survived the shooting, was flown to a Tucson hospital where he underwent surgery.
The case is being referred to the Pima County Attorney's Office, according to a Pima County Sheriff's detective. The boy's parents, Don and Sharina Marion, have not been arrested or charged. Don Marion is the volunteer fire chief for Elephant Head Fire Department.](http://www.gvnews.com/news/local/unsecured-guns-found-in-house-where-toddler-shot/article_1c5facb8-d965-11e3-bba4-001a4bcf887a.html?mode=jqm)

 MUSKEGON TOWNSHIP, MI --  The 27-year-old Muskegon Township man who was nearly naked and reportedly high on acid when he allegedly discharged his gun outside a pizza business on Saturday, with three kids in tow, has been arraigned on four misdemeanor charges.

...


Engle had three children with him  ages 6, 4 and 3  when police said he stood outside the pizza business wearing only a towel and pounding on the glass windows of the business until one shattered. His .40 caliber semi-automatic handgun went off in the process, damaging the casing on the business door.

 I remember the anti-poverty campaigns of the 70's and early 80's. And it seems our poverty problem is much worse this time around - it's going to take a massive shift in the perception of public opinion. But I'd argue the true public opinion is to help thy neighbor. It's just when people are manipulated into thinking that fixing the poverty problem is somehow giving people a free lotto ticket. It's just a fucked marketing campaign of the Paul Ryan austerity types, sitting pretty and calling out hate speech against the worst-off among us.  




 Go outside so I can play Deep Purple and enjoy my Rollie.  









 I don't understand why the cops didn't hang around and patrol around the park if there are "bad guys" living nearby. Their answer is that kids can't use the park, not that they will keep an eye out for the creepers? What the fuck is wrong with America right now?? GAWD.

 More death, more death, more death. Wonder no more! 



















 There should be a number similar to 911 that people could forward threatening texts to in the case that they know the aggressor is armed, or potentially armed. Something that could immediately send out an emergency alert like an Amber Alert to the area. (A Red Alert?) 



















 As we saw in the Santa Barbara massacre, the parents tried to warn cops but they needed access to his home. Now, a law is being passed so that concern IS the justifiable cause. This may help. 

I always hear that people don't want laws because law abiding citizens follow them and criminals don't. However, if we make selling a handgun without a background check illegal, all that does is put the good guys on notice to run background checks to ensure they aren't selling to a bad guy - which happens! Felons buy guns without background checks right now. One way or another we need that to end. If a GGWAG is selling in a private transaction and runs a background check and the buyer is a felon, the GGWAG has just potentially saved lives. I'll never get why someone who is supposedly a good guy gun owner would be against that.  



















 Background checks aren't required on all gun sales. It's one of the big issues for gun safety advocates right now.  




 It's come out that the majority of mass shootings have been done by people who have illegally obtained guns. It seems to ME that anyone pro-gun with half a brain would agree that background checks and registration would make their own gun ownership safer and more protected, because it could stop many of these massacres that make so many people afraid of gun owners. What's your take on this? Why not require background checks and registration of every firearm? 









 This is one of the best pieces I've read on the gun plague, especially interesting about her own personal connection to firearms via her father. Worth a read, y'all 
























 Mr. Milleas wife, Krista Millea, is also listed as a plaintiff in the suit. She was eight months pregnant at the time of the crash and, the suit says, suffered in the absence of her husband.

Ugh. Here's hoping this lawsuit forces a reversal of the recently-loosened regulations on truckers and hours / safety.
