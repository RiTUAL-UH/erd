 She's dead, Jim.
 




 I do wish the CBS Sports stream would quit crapping out. ROLL TIDE!! 









 Pffft we will be in the ACC long before then. :P 




 Good article. I asked a groundskeeper if they got hazard pay for football games. He said no. :(

Everyone did get holiday pay, since it was Thanksgiving break. 




 Me either.  




 [so the guy was wearing a gorilla mask](http://www.wtoc.com/story/27556260/gsu-police-open-streets-back-up-after-reports-of-suspicious-person) 




 The old one. 




 According to someone on Facebook with a police scanner, they apprehended a suspect before they gave the all clear. 




 They haven't evacuated the Carroll building, package may be a science project. 




 Sunbelt gets four tie-ins next year. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. 




 [We've got the beer pong table covered, you guys.](http://i.imgur.com/dxTWovQ.jpg) 




 Our final NCAA appeal was denied, so I don't see how we can unless some bowl committee just decides to be a rebel. 




 I see what you did there. 




 [I'm partial to this for the Championship](http://i.imgur.com/To8hyMm.jpg) 




 Alright then. Rings all around, gents! 




 I think when we were FCS we only had rings made for our 6 National Championships, but I could be wrong. I can't find a link anywhere that says one way or the other. 




 Fried, usually. It is the South after all. 




 Last year they served gator in the dining halls. [True Story](http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/12/georgia-southern-florida-alligator-dining) 




 "Undefeated Sunbelt Champs Celebrate Season with Pizza Party, Cosmic Bowling" 




 It's our first season in the FBS.  




 Yes Fritz did really well. Our kicking frustrated me, as well as the whole 'drop back six yards to gain two' thing our QBs kept doing. He did awesome, and I could tell he was invested in the boys. But we cannot afford complacency.
 




 Why thank you :)

 Georgia Southern fans travel VERY well (the University often sponsors bus trips) so that is not a legitimate argument against them playing. 

*kicks stupid rule* 




 Because we miss waaaay too many extra points. 









 In your own defense, it was a subtle taunt engineered to target only GaState fans. :) 




 *sadly kicks pebble around* 




 Source for this? :( 




 69-31 was an impressive win IMHO. :P 




 Another reason I'd like to see Southern play a bowl: Matt Brieda. 

He's a finalist for the Doak Walker award and more game time can only help his chances. The guys he is competing against all get that extra game. 




 Plus, Georgia southern has no transfer players in their roster. 




 Yea you're right, got confused. 




 Georgia Southern was barred from postseason FCS games last year because of the transition, but that was a team wide application. 

This page has some good info for individual athletes.

http://www.athleticscholarships.net/college-transfer-4-4.htm 




 I believe that just such a situation is what the rule was created to prevent. 

However Georgia Southern has zero transfers and significantly less scholarships than other sunbelt teams, which is why we are appealing. 




 Yeah, the stupid rule thing is my main argument. We have met (and exceeded) all the FBS qualifications. We wouldn't have made the transfer if we didn't. I'm bummed out that we are the only conference champs whose season is (probably) already over. I'm bummed out for the senior players who stuck it through the transition, beat Florida in the Swamp, earned an undefeated conference championship, and now have to watch teams they beat go play on the national stage instead. Give me a ONE MORE TIME!!  :) 




 I'm not sure what our chances are, but it would be nice. Our boys played their hearts out this season. HAIL SOUTHERN! 









 Nope, just a tech fan but thanks for playing slugger! 




 Lol thanks much. It does suck :(  




 Yea poor GSU ball :( 




 No worries, different approaches. :) 




 Lmao that would be the boyfriend I credited my post to. Too funny. 




 This was my boyfriend's suggestion.  









 Yes. Yes it is. 




 We are in a transitional season since we moved up from the SoCON last year. It's a NCAA rule. We put in a waiver request but we're denied. We have appealed the decision. We are 8-0 Sunbelt Champs and 9-3 overall in our first FBS season. Teams we squished will be going instead of us. :( 




 Lol

 Yea I noticed that too hehe but we have had that blue and white uniform style since Erk brought the program back because it was all we could afford. I think it's very classy. 




 http://imgur.com/8s4MPqp 









 It was really nice to see Youyoute get some good ball time in his last game. :) 
























 We made it to the table of 32. But still... HAIL SOUTHERN 




 [Next year we get the Cure Bowl in Orlando against an AAC team](http://curebowl.com)

The fifth bid starting in 2016 is actually gonna be on a rotational basis between a handful of conferences.  




 Sun Belt gets a fourth bowl bid next year, and a fifth after that. But Georgia Southern and CrApp State will be eligible so Texas might miss out again. :P 




 Yeah Georgia Southern is just buried in that article. :( 




 Lol Georgia Southern went 9-3 in their first season in the FBS and came within a score of beating both our ACC opponents this season. We ain't no cupcake team. 




 Aww sorry Sam Houston Bro. :( We are taking good care of him! 




 HAIL SOUTHERN :) 




 LOL I never thought about it that way but you are right. :) 









 Ooh that's neat! I like the buddy ticket idea. I'm sad you can't sit on the hill anymore though. :( 




 I work for UA Museums. Love it!  




 When I was at Georgia Southern (I graduated in '12) the football games were free if you paid your athletic fee (about 150? but it included other things like renovation costs and the rec center access too).

I work for the University of Alabama and they run a fac/staff season ticket lottery based on seniority. You have to buy the whole season. 




 Why not State of Georgia University Panthers? 




 [Here this friendly PSA should clear up any confusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=putYM15zC0Y feature=youtu.be) 




 [NO](http://mylolface.com/assets/faces/angry-no.jpg) 




 I get so sad that people still get confused by this. :( 




 Overall an exemplary season for the Panthers. They do a good job keeping Paulson North warm for us. 




 Hey they did their best to only win by one point. Don't be too hard on em. 




 Awesome. That makes me happy. 




 GSU AD actually reached out to the NCAA about doing it. Betcha can guess what those bastards said. :( 




 NCAA- Not Controlling Athletics Association /s 




 Kleinlein is a stand up guy. 









 All of them. The answer is all of them. 




 I bet someone down Auburn way might take him. ;) 




 I'm glad we could help you guys reach 15,006 average attendance.
 




 OK I'm gonna use Alabama, because I work there. [They had eight players drafted in 2014](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Alabama_Crimson_Tide_players_in_the_NFL_draft).

Their starting kicker, Cade Foster, was not among them. He is now a free agent. 

Players like that, who don't get drafted yet expected to. What kind of a future can they look forward to? What's the likelihood they will get picked up? Do they have skills they can fall back on if not? I'm legitimately concerned. The graduation - employment rate is low enough as it is. I should know I am a (gainfully employed!) recent anthropology grad. :) 




 If their coaches are not properly educating their players about what a long shot it is (about 3% according to the NCAA website, but that's across all divisions) then they are doing those kids a disservice. I'd really like to know what happens to the kid who stakes all his hopes on getting into the NFL and prepared for no other option. What does he do? Flip burgers? 




 Yeah but they're not all gonna get drafted.
 




 I enjoyed the analysis of this article and I'd like to see the data from other Universities. I feel like this should all be public information for any public institution. 




 I always implore our defense to squish 'em, but I never claimed to not be weird. 




 GREATEST THING 




 Georgia Southern was the first team to be undefeated in conference/outright champs in the first year of transition since the rule was made. 

Still sad panda. :( 




 I read somewhere that ODU wasn't eligible either because of transition. 




 I think you got down votes because most Georgia Southern Fans don't think very highly of UGA even though we can't really be considered football 'rivals.' A lot of it goes way back to when Erk Russell left UGA to start our program. Some of it has to do with how hard they fought to block us becoming a University as well. We like Tech though. 




 HAIL SOUTHERN 




 YES 




 Yes, that is also a good one because it shows us being classy in our celebrations. 




 So we should change it to mountain goats, or what? 




 LOL @ CrApp State Sheep and Sad Georgia State ball. :) 




 [HAIL SOUTHERN](https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/p480x480/10421115_10152812749846855_9028560074656845079_n.jpg?oh=591fc03693b7a45af29c151ac707d387 oe=55017D71 __gda__=1430674023_d16d004edd682d0c816bc97dcbf5c0b9) 




 I would attend this game.

However wouldn't Georgia Southern get in trouble? :( 




 The difference is Georgia Southern went 8-0 in conference play and holds an outright championship.

EDIT TO ADD- And we are the first team to have done so since the rule was implemented. 




 Almost like they are rewarding certain conferences for having an actual championship game... Hmmm ;) 




 Those boys are not giving up... LOVE IT GO JACKETS 




 This happens with cameramen inexperienced with the Option
 




 He didn't learn it at Southern....he just coached it there first

aight 




 Truth. Although that game made me sad face. 




 I believe we face both your flairs next season :) 




 Gators. 




 Everyone in here like 'WOO GT's OFFENSE' but CPJ learned it at Georgia Southern 




 Samesies 




 No passing, no problem budday 




 OK Drink get nekkid 




 Time to WRECK THE NOLES
