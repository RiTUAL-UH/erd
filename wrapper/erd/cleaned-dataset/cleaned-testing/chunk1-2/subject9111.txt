 That's hecka creepy. Imagine if someone hacked into a nanny cam along with the monitor. They could watch you and talk to you but you would have no freakin idea who/where/why. 
























 That would be horrifying, but at least there is plenty of evidence. Also, a basic drawing or blueprint of your floor would help greatly.
