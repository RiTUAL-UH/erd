 Probably you are right. As a proof, here is my photoblog from 2 years ago (while I had more time, I went outdoors and tried to capture some awesome portraits):

 Mine app reviews were deleted, the scores however were left untouched. Do you experince the same?

Maybe a small revolution for app reviews is comming (hopefully they will decay with time). 




 Thanks, no it was taken in Warsaw at bowling center (at the bar).

I would say that only downside of camera is a fact that it protrudes from body, so I often put finger on it - and then lens is dirty. So remember to swipe with t-shirt it before taking an awesome photo :)

I still experiment with battery but I find battery life quite decent, and phone is awesome to hold (5" but still small and light). 




 Do you know any wireless charger (iQ, would be used with Nexus 5) with an extra USB port in it?
So besides the phone (wireless) I can charge a mp3, or a tablet without getting under the desk. 




 Thank you - just rooting N5, and it is next thing on my to-do list.  




 Anyone can confirm that? I don't like spending about 3$ just like that...
Because it is not visible in their screenshots. 









 Also in Polish. 









 You can use Dropbox API or SkyDrive. I don't have any experience with any of those two so I cannot be an expert. 




 Will it be live somewhere on the Internet? 









 It look like it was wrote for Android 2.X, for sure not with current guidelines. Otherway nice work. 




 But you need to give a gmail account as I understand, and later on there is no way to transfer this Google Play money between accounts... 




 Germany have them - code on each kitkat (outside) - bought 6 of them, and no prize.

Poland - they are but competition page says 1 more day and 20h to start of a competition. And code is going to be on a receipt/bill (so as I understand 1 per one shopping, not per bar).

Italy and Austria - I haven't seen them, when I checked 1 week ago. 




 I was staring at first two, and wondering what I'm missing...  




 Keep up with Google guidelines - for sure app using G+ multiplayer are not worst due to matter of used service. Take a look at Osmos HD multiplayer - quite nicely done!

I don't know how it is in your country/surrounding but more and more my friends started using G+ as it is more hmmm, lets say 'professional' (less family) and it is connected to your phone. 




 It is a preview of FPS made Blue Brick (polish game studio), Left mouse click to shot, right to drop a weapon. Simple as that. 









 [Age of Zombies](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halfbrick.ageofzombies) - shooter 

[4 Player Reactor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=coolcherrytrees.games.reactor4) - great to play with with friends at one phone.

[Can Knockdown 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.idreams.CanKnockdown2) - throwing balls at targets

[Cartoon Wars](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamevil.cartoonwars.one.global) - defending castle, while sending own troops to take down opponent castle.
 




 I lost hope that it will be finally out, nice but somehow I enjoyed more 1,2, or 3 parts. 




 On what video? I'm asking how to implement such effect in my app, not how to turn it on in YT app. 




 Bought it in UK, regretted immediately... 









 Hi, latest update of YouTube app brings awesome feature of video over activity. Does anybody knows how they achieve it (or get similar result)? 




 S4 Mini, LG L5 II, or Samsung Galaxy S Advance. 




 Samsung S4 Mini -http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_i9190_galaxy_s4_mini-5375.php 




 Some story behind that gif:
It was during EURO 2012 in Warsaw - when hosts (Poland) was playing with England - game was postponed. But there is a roof which (even despite that forecast was saying that it is going to rain) was left open.
As a result of waiting for the game, two guys run on pitch - they were arrested, but later on (as I remember correctly) their charges were withdrawn. 




 Anyone have it to share apk file?  









 There  is a video of that gif:

 I got few pairs of headphones (always 'in ear' ones) which have same problem - one from pair is broken, in some of them it start working when you hold cable near jack (where cable ends, and jack starts) at special angle.
Is there any easy way to fix them? So far I was always buying a new pair (all of them last around 5-12 months), but it's enough! 





























 In my country (Poland) where mech keyboards are not popular, Razer is quite easy available. I bought it as it was for ~100$ when buying any other would be around 200$ (120$ + 40-50$ (shipping) + duty charge (20-30$) = around 200$).

So Razer was quite good choice considering situation. I own black widow tournament edition (love tkl), and now I'm considering buying Shine 3 TKL with browns.

 Story:http://www.wykop.pl/wpis/6622222/kupie-pizze-2-za-10-000-doge-mieszkam-w-olawie-mow/

It's polish portal similar to reddit, a guy with nick "noisy" asked somebody to ordered 2 pizzas to [Oawa](https://goo.gl/maps/6JWSz) offering 10k in Dogecoins.
A guy "SharpNieSharp" took a challenge and ordered them, a special ask was to write "Dogecoin" on a box.
Pierogi (dumplings) was an extra thing - personal choice of SharpNieSharp.



Edit: If you need any translation - just ask (exam tomorrow so I will do anything apart from studying).  




 Is that setup sponsored by Razer and Pepsi? 




 I thought it would be cheaper to sell whole keyboard and buy new switches - then I looked at prices per switch... 




 Why do you want to save pieces (switches as I suppose), is it better to clean it (without desoldering) and sell? And use that money to spend on new one? 




 "Where do you come from fella?"

 Do you also wrap it up and send it to yourself - few days of that feeling "Is today going to be THAT day?" 




 Let's start with ***"640K ought to be enough for anybody."*** - Bill Gates, not true at all - sorry folks.  














 If you tried and didn't fall in love, lucky you - that shit is expensive, but in my opinion worth it. 




 Try mechanical - never go back... 




 Sorry for not changing system language or trying to make it English-readable. Top is "Birthday are celebrating by:" and buttons are "Send birthday wishes".

As a extra info - Polish is one of hardest to learn language - If you have any questions I will glad to answer them.

//EDIT: Spelling

 Painful is to see it reposted X time...  




 I see 12z (it is about 4$), so

A) It doesn't work

B)Not yet has spreaded through play store

C)It is region limited promotion 









 Uff... you didn't find it. This is just a hoodie that I get as a mobile dev, so it is just a promo, if you expected a viral Nokia clothes commercial - sorry to disappoint you, not that time.





There is nothing in the background. 




 She laughed, otherwise it wouldn't be here. So don't think of me as that bad person. 




 I got it as a mobile dev and she really liked it, plus I'm into Android, so I wasn't regretting it. 




 I recommend to watch that: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyTEKhkB8OM#t=86

one of his commercials. 









 I was as well afraid but I gave it a shot... and it totally worked - she was just angry that I didn't crop out the background, but not such things I have seen on reddit.

That is awesome collection of ergonomic keyboards! 




 What are your personal feeling on cherry mx clear? Asking from curiosity as I'm more then happy with blue. 




 Can you write something more about how they work (comparing to 'normal' keys)? 
Is there any 3d model of a universal keyboard key or did you do it by yourself?
Awesome idea!
