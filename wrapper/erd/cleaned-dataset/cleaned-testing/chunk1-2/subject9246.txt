 Mine generally have to be in omelet form. Scrambled is a weird texture, and if the yolk and whites are separate, I can't stand the taste. Mushroom, tomato, onion, pepper, and cheese omelet is my favorite. 

As a kid and even a teen, I hated beans, but since becoming vegetarian I have tried them again and opened up to them. 

Ice cream is obviously delicious, but milk has always been my beverage of choice. 

I looked for my main nutrition book to see if I could find any more information, but it's back at my parents' place. When I go home for thanksgiving I'll see if it has anything else to say about it and if it has anything about nutrition and depression. 

Where are you looking to attend and what do you want to major in? Anything science tends to do that until enough information, research, and studies are available to come to a definite conclusion. In all of my classes I have been taught omega 3 is beneficial. 

Me too, I just searched my schools courses to see if any went over nutrition and depression/anxiety, but I wasn't able to find anything.

I've started searching online for local psychiatrists/therapists, and it is slightly overwhelming.  

Respecting my likes and dislikes is something I need to work on. I don't mind going to the bar and being social, but I'm kind of past the drunken college party scene. 

I know you said changing your diet helped, but are you also currently taking any medication or seeking counseling? (I apologize if you've already covered this, I'm on my phone and I'm not sure how to see previous posts while typing a reply. :/) 




 Such a simple phrase, yet that would probably solve half the problem. Thank you for sharing.  




 I keep telling myself it will pass, but it hasn't.  




 I eat eggs occasionally, but have always been super picky with how they have to be cooked, otherwise I don't like the taste. 

The best sources for protein are definitely from meat, dairy products are also good and grains have some protein, but not much. I get most of my protein from dairy products and beans. I absolutely love milk and skim actually has more protein than whole milk.

If you're interested in studying nutrition, go for it. There is a lot of information out there and you could easily purchase books and learn a lot on your own. Just make sure they are credible. Nutrition is just my minor, but in my spare time I try to learn as much as I can.  




 Nutrition is one of the things I'm studying in school, and what you're saying makes a lot of sense. I've been pescatarian (vegetarian but eats seafood) for about 8 months now, and I'm sure I have several deficiencies based on my diet that hasn't helped my depression.  




 Exactly. If I could pinpoint it, then I could fix it. 

I'm sorry you're in the same boat. I wouldn't wish this feeling on anyone.  




 The word mate makes me smile. 

Have you found anything that helps? 




 Definitely not the answer I was looking for, but it makes sense.  




 Are meds really the only option? I was on some meds for about two months and I hated it, haven't been on them in almost a year and I really don't want to be. :/  




 Definitely going to print that off the next time I'm in the computer lab.

Thank you.  




 Words cannot describe how much what you said is what I needed to hear.  




 Thank you. :)  




 I also really don't want to be put on medication, and when I went to my family doctor, that was the first and only thing she did. 




 I know for me to actively seek out a therapist is probably the hardest thing for me, but probably the best step for me as well. I've admitted to myself that something isn't right, but if I admit it to someone else, that would mean I can't pretend that I'm okay anymore. 

One of my biggest fears is being told by a therapist that I need to just get over it - I know how ridiculous that sounds.  




 Which is more helpful, seeing a therapist or a psychiatrist?  




 I've thought about seeing someone, but I'm really bad at communicating how I feel and opening up to a stranger. Was it hard at first for you to open up? 




 Thank you. :)  




 I'm finding more and more uses for the blowtorch. Just used it to make Smores in my kitchen. Best investment ever.  




 Used this recipe http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/vanilla-bean-creme-brulee-recipe/index.html and used an entire vanilla bean instead of only half. Struggled with the blowtorch part a bit though, in the pic you can see some of the sugar wasn't completely caramelized, but on other ones I ended up burning it. Any suggestions? 









 I used to have a hedgehog named Popcorn, and this makes me miss him. This is adorable. :)  




 In the basement of Robinson is also an old butcher area and the freezers are creepy.  




 Even if the save battery dies, they are super easy to replace.  




 I feel your pain, the only internship I could find was nonpaying, but what makes it worse is I need the internship for graduation and thus I am paying for the credits.

I pay to go to work everyday... 




 What to expect: They will prick your finger before you can give blood to test your iron.  




 Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs - any good? 




 Call at age 5 to explain that there was nothing I could do to stop my grandpa and uncle from committing suicide, and to not waste the next 17 years trying to please everyone and feeling like a failure when I'm not successful. Because 1. It is impossible to please everyone, 2. Pleasing everyone won't bring my grandpa and uncle back, and 3. Even if people seem happy on the outside, it doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside. 




 I got glasses for the first time in 2nd grade and made the same discovery - I told everyone because I wanted to make sure everyone knew that trees had leaves. 
























 I'm not good at showing emotions so I just ate them and said how great they were.   




 My sister thinks I'm going through a phase and am crazy, yet at the same time she is one of my supporters.  




 Exactly. My parents keep vegetarian burgers, lasagnas, etc in the freezer for when I come home to visit. It's nice then even though I don't live with them, they want to make sure I have quick and easy access to food when I'm around.  




 I've been a fish eating vegetarian (pescatarian) for about 10 months now and the hardest part is family gatherings especially around holidays. Today is my family's Christmas get together and for Christmas we do a lot of finger foods: meatballs, ham rollups, veggies, etc. One of my favorite foods are my mom's ham rollups. I could easily eat a whole platter. I have never asked my family to change their recipes or make special accomodations for me - it's never been an issue finding something to munch on. Well today as we are setting the table, I notice something different, my mom made vegetarian ham rollups. Instead of wrapping the pickle and cream cheese spread in ham, she wrapped them in a spinach leaf. They tasted so good, even some of my meat eating family were snacking on them, I actually had to make sure I got some because the regular ham rollups were being ignored. 

This small gesture meant a lot to me, and I just wanted to share with you how awesome my mom is.  




 Inconceivable!  




 I'm sorry. I suppose I have some pretty understanding friends/family. I've received some grief from meat eaters, but I tend to brush it off and move on. I also found not mentioning it helps. Many of my friends don't even realize I'm pescatarian. Got to be stealthy. ;)  




 I'm pescatarian and it makes it easier. Make fish or order fish at a restaurant is easier than ordering vegetarian or vegan. My family loves that I'm not full out vegetarian because they can cook one meal everyone will eat. 




 WARNING: Has the emotional stability of an 8 year old.  




 Do you still need six and seven? 




 I know the feeling. I actually deleted my Facebook a couple months ago and it was the best thing for me. 
I've gotten closer with my few close friends, I've stopped worrying about what is going on in the lives of people who I used to know and comparing them to myself. I've even had some old friends reach out through phone calls and texts to see what's new in my life. The things I would want to post and sometimes did post, I now turn to my friends about and they've been a lot more helpful than I'd ever imagine.  




 As a Stephen King fan, I am super jealous. I own maybe ten of his books, but my goal is to have a Stephen King bookshelf one day. Thanks for sharing. :)  




 You are correct. Anyone can call themselves a nutritionist, but a dietician requires school, internship, and then an exam to become certified. 

Source: Once was a Dietetic major. 




 I will. Thank you!  




 Thank you. 




 Thank you for sharing what you went through. It's nice to know others have gone through the same thing. 

I've started searching for a good psychiatrist near me. 

Funny you should mention reading. Growing up I'd escape inside a book daily, but with school and work I haven't found time lately. Well last night I pushed everything aside and read just a few chapters of a non school related book. I've missed that.  




 I've contemplated driving recklessly into a tree. 




 To me up north was always the UP. 




 Mt pleasant is not up north....is it? 




 That's why I generally resort to saying "I'm tired" or "I'm stressed"
 




 True, I wouldn't want to put someone through that.  




 Thank you so much for taking the time to respond to all my questions. It really means a lot. :) 




 I've gone to the free services on campus before, but they don't really know how to deal with things like this. You get x amount of free visits and they are more for homesickness, help adjusting to college, balancing work and school, and various things like that. Their advice to me was "get involved on campus" and you'll feel better. Not really helpful in my case. :/  




 Thank you. I'm not ready to give up yet.  




 Getting hit by a car is another one that crosses my mind sometimes.  




 Have you had any negative side effects from taking GABA? 

Thank you for sharing what worked for you. :)  




 Same here.  




 Couldn't have said it better myself.  




 I work out when I can, could probably do it more often though. 

Slightly afraid of AD side effects, but also against the idea of them in general 
- I don't like taking medication in general.
