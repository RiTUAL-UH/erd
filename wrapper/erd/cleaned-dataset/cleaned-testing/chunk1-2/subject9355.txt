 Best bit of advice my parents have ever taught me was to "just ask", the worst they can say is "no" (I know thats not the worst but that was the general principle) 
I've had this attitude since and its handy, its given me the confidence to approach new employers.. girlfriends.. 




 Confidence to follow through with my plans. 




 try "I'm really confused by this assignment, how about you?" or "Hi, can I borrow a pen? I'm useless at being prepared...." or something along them lines. Then follow it up with "How long have you been in this class for? I've never seen you before?"   




 Oh yeh, like during the olympics 
























 I'm so sorry to hear this, how old were you?  




 Theres an instrumental by Danny Elfman called 'Finale' used in the film Kingdom, gets me everytime. 




 People like to say they hate it because other people say they hate it. Its really quirky! 




 8tracks.com is a great website   app, basically people upload there own playlists and tag them by genre, theme ect
