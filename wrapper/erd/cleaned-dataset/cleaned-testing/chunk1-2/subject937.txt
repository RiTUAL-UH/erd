 Accountants know which businesses are thriving and managed the best: which painter, roofer, plumber, electrician, dentist, etc. 














 Dear [test_subject937],

Thank you for contacting me about net neutrality.

I oppose any form of censorship or discrimination. I believe those who pay for our web capacity must be able to recover their costs, or it won't get built.

Supporters of net neutrality argue that giving all internet users the highest speed and greatest volume of space available - whether or not they contribute to the cost of building that capacity - is the only way to guarantee that no one will be discriminated against on the basis of what they want to say. However, there is very little incentive for carriers to build infrastructure if they have no way to recoup their costs. Without such an incentive, many new high bandwith applications, such as medical technology and communications for emergency personnel, many not be feasible.

Simply put, I believe providers shouldn't be able to block access to any other providers on the basis of content, and access to the capacity that has been built by the public should be open to the public on equal terms. But, access to future capacity should be open on equal terms to those who share the cost of its construction.

Thanks again for caring enough to get involved, and please don't hesitate to contact me again in the future.

Sincerely,

John Barrow

 I couldn't find anything about it (and hope this sub is appropriate). Does anyone have any idea?

Will voice calls via Hangouts have to use a Google Voice number or will it use the phone's? 




 It's been posted on their Facebook page.

Thanks for all the great memories! 










































































 I'm hearing that the water tower by the ANGC busted due to the earthquake. It was leaking before then - big time. We saw water cascading out about 15 minutes before the quake. 









 And which is worse? 
























 Apart from PDF Mergy, I haven't been able to find many apps that allow manipulation of PDFs. I'd really like to be able to split a PDF into two, rotate a page, and perform OCR.

Any suggestions? 














 I just received an email allegedly from Google (no-reply@accounts.google.com) stating that someone attempted to sign into me Google Account. The email has the standard blue button link to reset my password.

I was initially suspicious so I did a quick search and it seems bogus. Can anyone here confirm that it is not legitimate? I reported the email as a phishing attempt.

Thanks! 









 Is anyone else having this problem? My Nexus 7 (2013) randomly reboots at least once a day, but usually more. It's annoying and since I use it for work, it often happens at critical moments.

Also, I have Google Maps on the home row and it is removed every time it reboots. All the other slots are folders so I'm not sure if that's the cause or if it is something specific to Google Maps. 









 An earlier thread had a discussion about how we used to count by suns/daytime and nights. It makes more sense for a "day" to begin at roughly sunrise. Was this standardized by the same folks who standardized the calendar? 



















 [Google Calendar Auto-fill](http://i.imgur.com/p6BYAd4)

Confirmed: [Google Calendar taps Maps for location autocomplete suggestions, and shows relevant events as you search](http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/12/04/google-calendar-taps-maps-location-autocomplete-suggestions-shows-relevants-events-search/) 














 We drove about 450 miles both ways. Using Maps, we were able to anticipate delays and find routes around them.

All told, we dodged 4 massive jams. It's hard to know how much time we saved but we figure at least an hour, maybe two. 




 For one, it assumes household finances are analogous to government finances. And it tells us _nothing_ important (because it's a low bar we all meet - to be a functioning adult is to balance a checkbook).

Is there a way that it is/can be used that is not a cop out? In my experience, it is usually said by someone who doesn't want to be tied to the social platform of the Republican party, but more so doesn't want to be thought of as a liberal or a Democrat.

I've thought this for years and am genuinely curious that I am missing something. 












































 I'd like to be able to give my boyfriend access to my reminders (and vice versa). When we are running low on, say, toilet paper, either one of us can say: "Remind me and [boyfriend] to buy toilet paper at Kroger."

When either one of us goes to Kroger... ding!

It seems like it would be easy for Google to do, and I'm sure there are other ways it could be used. Thoughts, /r/Android? 



















 Both cheeks when the shadow covers the entire lane; left or right when it only covers the left or right portion.

I'm 31 and still love doing it. I tell myself it's why I have a bedonk. 














 I have very little knowledge of the net's infrastructure so forgive me if it's a dumb question. It just seems to me that the very nature of the internet makes it impossible to truly be anonymous. 



































































































 I apologize if this has been asked and answered. I searched this sub and Google but couldn't find an answer.

The sound works fine for seemingly everything else.

Thanks in advance, r/applehelp! 





























 Augusta, GA here! My boyfriend and I are planning a NYC trip during Masters weekend this year (April 12th to 14th). Neither of us have been there before and we need some help finding a hotel. Any reasonably priced but decent suggestions?

Thanks in advance! 




 Bottom line is as it appears: what can be done here? My cousin is such a good person - but she has decided that his lack of belief in the Christian god is a deal breaker.

I'm asking for effective advice... he wants to be with her. He does not want her to "convert" to his "religion"; but she is demanding the same.

Is this fair? And what can be done (in good faith)? 




 Karma is no more/less valuable than video game points. And the frontpage seems very similar to a final boss.

Does reaching the front page reduce this tendency? Front page fame is not worthless; fame a second time is still something.

Is a game any less valuable?
 














 The good Senator is deleting all the comments because he isn't getting the response he thought he'd get.

It also appears he edited the original post (I have a screenshot).

Who's up for showing him how wrong he is? I bet we can post comments quicker than he can delete them! 









 What is the best way to verify the team of someone requesting membership on G+? I've seen people suggest requesting a screenshot of the comm with the invitee's name (and color) but I'm not convinced that is very reliable.

Thanks in advance! 









 What is Google's end game? What will a fully unified Google Account look like and how will it enhance your life?

Also, what are some product combinations you would like to see? 














 When the app loads and locks in on the player, does it zoom in on your exact location on the globe? It does for me (and I assume Google wouldn't choose my small-ish city as a default, hence the possible dumbness). 









 We were trying to destroy resonators by a museum around midnight. They saw my parked car and got out to investigate. At this point, I don't think they knew we were there. 

We approached them and they asked what we were up to. We showed them the phone and explained that it is a global game of capture the flag created by Google. That simple explanation dropped the tension level down dramatically (they didn't know what they were walking into until then). 

They laughed and checked it out a bit. Told us not to get "attacked" ourselves, and went on their way. 

Overall, it was a good experience. We told them that they might start seeing more people like us and it's just a game.  




 From the letter posted on the investigation board:

SWEKU 
XKCWDJHOYELFMSBZUQI 
ARSMZEPIWOUK 
QUESIWOYHPMTKBGR 
KXUEGPMCOIW 
YWQNEUIXBGKRZHAO

Does anyone know what it means? It doesn't seem like a alphabetical substitution cipher... 




 Where's the big surprise? Does anyone know if anything actually happened tonight? 









 Call it an embarrassment of riches but I am getting email notifications constantly (I pretty much own every portal in the area and you get one for every resonator destroyed). 

Can we turn these GD notifications off? I suppose I can create a filter but that's just a work-around. 









 Check out the history map for a good overview of your work!

I've been active for about 7 days and... WOW! I've covered my area quite nicely.

(I'd post my map but it's all buggy this morning for some reason.) 




 Can anyone confirm (from an official source) that we are currently in beta?

And if so, what will be the major changes between beta and the official release? Obviously there will probably be no invitation process. What about items? Will they rain down from heaven like they do now (when turning in codes)?

I'd like to see this turn into a general "how the official release will differ from beta" thread if possible. 




 I have trouble pronouncing "pronunciation". Not because I wasn't exposed to or didn't know the correct pronunciation, but because a friend of mine hilariously mispronounced it one day while trying to defend his failure to properly pronounce another word (resulting in an ongoing joke that is over 10 years old). 

Now I legitimately get the the two versions confused and have to pause and mentally say it before verbally saying it. 



















 For me, it's the definition of despotism. The Civilization series introduced me to that word and it seems like a term that most people should know.

But I distinctly remember one of my best friends in college needing a definition from me when I used the term to describe Saddam Hussein's regime.

She is very intelligent and well-educated, which only made it that much more perplexing to me.

So, Reddit, what other examples are there? 







































 Well I don't disagree. But will South Africa have a food shortage without China? 




 Nah - I'm a liberal Dem. Just passing the info along. (Plus I'll be out of town.) 




 I agree (work in the legal field). Perjury is for some reason not taken that seriously.

As testimony is often the only available evidence, perjury _should_ be a primary concern of the judicial system. 




  If it's economic pressure, you can't really blame the SA government.

Every decision has various pressures. How far are you willing to take this?

 









 My personal experience definitely confirms this. I wore it from 7:45 am until 8:45 pm yesterday and it had ~30% left.

I responded to texts, used navigation, controlled music in the car, received various notifications throughout the day, and checked the time several times. I would consider my usage moderate to heavy.

This is a dramatic increase from the battery before the update. I was going to return the damn thing and now I don't think I will. 




 Get a flu shot regardless of your age. Protect your tiny and elderly loved ones! 




 Because they're not humans with our varied motivations. 




 Did my reply disappear? Weird. But, yeah, no worries. I'm sure everyone gets the same initial letter - I just didn't realize (until /u/tonytaylor85 pointed it out in this thread) that everyone gets the same letter every time. 




 Why? Seriously? It's literally a Representative's job to be responsive to constituents. This sort of thing could _really_ piss someone off, particularly the type of person who takes the time to contact their Representative twice about the same issue.

And you don't need unique letters for each person, just succeeding letters: 1st inquiry, 2nd inquiry, etc. And probably after the second, a valid response would be "My position hasn't changed since the last letter." Hell, even that would be better than sending the same letter the second time.

It'd be as simple as a spreadsheet. Even small businesses handle more workflow than that... 




 It's surprising to me that it wasn't updated, yes. I would think they have a simple procedure to avoid exactly this situation. 




 Ignore the haters - congratulations! You look great! 




 Internationally respected human rights lawyer is a damn good catch. 




 Downtown is safe during Westobou, particularly the old Academy. It's kinda odd to claim otherwise, really.

I know I'll be there. 




 *Katy Perry 




 Nested cubes rotating in succession. 




 No, just go back to /u/TheBrokenWorld's suggestion. "Doing nothing" and your awful idea aren't the only two options. 




 Or between movies. 




 Realized how great this is last weekend on a road trip.

When in unfamiliar towns on back roads, there are often a lot of turns. I was behind an impromptu caravan and they all went right when I thought I was supposed to go left. I had about 3 seconds to decide and the watch allowed me to verify to go left.

Not much but it was pretty damn nice. 




 Awareness does have value. 




 It was yesterday. Allen's camp said a video of it would be on their website by Monday. 




 I'm not quite there yet but did just walk out of Costco with more cash than I arrived with. 




 Rick Allen said his supporters wouldn't feel comfortable in a mosque.

He apparently thinks that is a valid reason. 




 But where? The whole nation has this problem. 




 Most of downtown doesn't fit the "frat boy" stereotype. It's actually the exception. Go to The Loft for starters.

And I agree that online dating isn't bad. Why expect to randomly run into a compatible partner? That's inefficient as fuck. 




 Well... it's printed on each panel so yeah. 




 I think this exists. 




 But it's vital that we pay attention and participate. 




 Wait what's her new addiction? 




 Yup. As a Georgian, it was great knowing my vote mattered. 




 Good start though. Give them that. For what it's worth, I'm a gay atheist (not in a Muslim majority country). 




 Oh! _This'll_ show the conservative commentators of my local paper! 




 I hate ultra orthodox everything. 




 You know what? Fuck you, man. The same could be done for Christianity. Islam =/= terrorism.

Edit: And based on your short comment history, this is your "thing". People like you make the world a worse place. 




 Man it was so exciting to watch. Every Tuesday was "Super Tuesday" and you never knew who would be ahead week to week.

It was one of the best elections I've ever witnessed. 









 [Here's](http://www.wfxg.com/story/26621875/who-called-off-congressional-debate-at-mosque) an article from WFXG about the kerfuffle. 














 After reading the article that is the only source for the Wikipedia entry, and perusing the restaurant's English site, I don't see any evidence that the same restaurant has been in business for 900 years (regardless of menu changes). 




 Does it though? I assume this is the source of your claim:

The medieval town is mainly famous for its stone bridge over the Danube, built between 1135 and 1146... To complete the construction of this bridge, Roman workers counted on Bavarian sausages to keep them going.

Sausages were sold there at that time but there isn't any indication that sausages have been sold there continuously since 1146. And even if they have been, it doesn't seem that it's been the same business:

The recent owners of the restaurant purchased it in 1806 from the Regensburg State authority.

It's an impressive building for sure and it may have been used only as a sausage restaurant when actually in use, but there is nothing in the article to really support the claim that there has been the same business there for 900 years (which is what the title claims). 




 The source for the Wikipedia article states the _building_ is 900 years old, not the business. Or am I reading that wrong? 




 As a Georgian... do this. Make this happen. 




 Yeah it's not that hard to do just as quickly. I'm American and chose to switch to 24-hour because it makes more sense and is useful for my work. That was about 5 years ago and 20:15 means the same thing in my head that 8:15 p.m. does. No math needed. 




 I disable push notifications for this reason. Fuckers are mean. 




 I unsuccessfully tried switching 360's with my boyfriend (he has the silver model, I have the black) and now I can't choose Facer from the watch face options. :-(

I've tried uninstalling/installing and resetting the watch but nothing seems to work.

Anyone had this happen? Any suggestions? 




 Yes. 




  It's possible to refer to people without gendering them.

Not using pronouns in English is very difficult if you have more than a brief interaction with the person. I sit on the board of a statewide LGBT organization and one of our interns is transgendered (F to M). He and I were scheduled to spend an entire day together and I ultimately had to ask our Executive Director for guidance. As for his name, it was completely neutral and provided no additional information. 




 In my experience, clothing isn't really helpful. 




 Thank you. 









  Within the constitutional framework. 




 Somewhat changes the impression someone may get from your emphasis of "am". It was essentially "I'm not American but I've got a justice boner." 




 It's a shame your parent comment has now been deleted. And he had gold. 




 I think I've seen on cable news that analysts think Syria's passive consent would probably be required. Anyone seen that? 




 I hope the involvement of Arab states changes the equation.

Edit: I responded when the post was just the first sentence (not sure if that's relevant though). 




 The "OMG, it works!" posts are much more obviously bullshit though. 




 Deciding to change and then changing is one of the most impressive things anyone can do. 




 When I was in college and worked at my dad's office over the summers, he introduced me as "Studley Do-Right". Complete dead pan.

I would then have to exist as Studley Do-Right for that person... 




 Top 5 childhood games. Leveling up spells was so satisfying. 




 I lost 20 lbs on a vanilla milkshake diet after this surgery. 




 One I know for a fact is an army base. 




 Delicate question but this seems like a good place to ask it.

If someone's gender is not apparent to me, how do I clear that up in a non-offensive way so proper pronouns are used, etc.? 




 Just reading the word "trypophobia" makes my skin crawl. And I didn't know I had this phobia until reddit... (thanks, assholes). 




 [sniff] I love you, Mom.
 




 I didn't mean to be judgmental and apologize. As our earning capacity increases, we can lose sight of how things used to be and how things are for other people.

I recommend Revenge and Orange is the New Black. Both are very binge-worthy. 




 I wondered that, too. Was it more of a "not a priority" thing or actually a "cannot afford" thing? 




 Straight as can be (he runs with his blonde, model-level girlfriend). 




 Runs around shirtless showing off his ridiculously toned physique. For a gay male couple, it's one part awe and one part seething hatred/jealousy. 




 I agree. This is a good suggestion. 




 Old book smell makes me need to poop. Am I alone in this? 




 Ah. It might be said somewhere English is spoken but it's probably rare.

Do you know what the two different verb tenses are? English seems to hide tenses that are more easily identified in other languages. 




 I don't think I've ever heard anyone use that contraction verbally in that context. I only encounter it when it's the certain tense, e.g., "they have been" - "they've been"; "they have gone" - "they've gone". 




 There's simply no option for it on the web version.
 




  They've to

Do you say this? 




 Yup. We both saw it (we'd be doubting our sanity otherwise). 




 My boyfriend had a notification card in Keep this evening (the web-version ones that pop up to explain new features and you click "Got it" to close). It said that you can now share Keep notes and specifically mentioned editing among family and friends.

Unfortunately, we didn't think to do a screenshot and now we can't find _anything_ about it. Has anyone received that notification? Any word that this is actually in the pipeline? 




 I'm not trying to find racism. That's not what this is about. This is about the patently absurd notion that today's GOP - if teleported back in time - would be the ideological party of Lincoln.

And still no sources from you... 




 Voting patterns changed in part due to how the parties [reacted](http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/07/14/331298996/why-did-black-voters-flee-the-republican-party-in-the-1960s) to the Civil Rights movement. Republicans have not changed their position on economic issues, but they have on social issues.

And how about providing sources rather than calling people names? 




 It's been circulating for years because it is a [historical fact](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t source=web rct=j ei=_dkdVKX9LZWsyATU7oKoAw url=http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/reversal2.pdf cd=7 ved=0CC0QFjAG usg=AFQjCNHqFzh82rIE-WAnvqlfLHabrruCFg sig2=ohnzV_sPjxYxjvoSJyAZ5A) (PDF) despite people like you trying to change history. 














 This was fascinating. Thank you! 




 I'm still going to have to ask for a source. A family farm worth over $5 million may not be liquid rich, but it _is_ rich.

How many farms that qualify as small businesses and family farms are subject to the estate tax? 




 Inheriting wealth seems quite antithetical to hard work, personal responsibility, and meritocracy. It should at best be viewed as something we put up with for other reasons (e.g., property rights).

In fact, inheritance should be viewed as embarrassing. Those who inherit should have a much higher standard for personal success. 









 I'm dying here... 






































































































































 Hi, /r/charleston! My boyfriend and I are planning a quick one night visit and are looking for a nice bed and breakfast. Suggestions?

We are looking for something secluded and preferably on the water (marsh, coastal seaway, ocean). Relaxation is our goal so being near nightlife is not important. Oh, and gay-friendly is a must.

Thanks in advance! 




 I hope you're ready for your close-up, Augusta...
