 Delete alien blue. Download Ruby For Reddit. It's WAYYYY easier to navigate. That's what I use for mobile 




 I don't watch tv a lot. When I do I watch, like, sponge bob or something. But I have seen a couple of old tv series and I don't think they are that great. I think that the tv series now are even worse though. They are just boring to watch :P 




 Why? 




 Haha that was me! 




 WHAT IS IT!!!! I'm old enough to know! We had our sex ed already! 




 We'll then. 




 Okay!!!!! 




 Probably. I'm not doing anything 




 What's that? 




 TWINS!!!!!!! 




 No, you creep! 




 Oh, and you won't be able to read any other book for a month because of the trauma :) 




 I can see why. 




 What's that? 




 Okay, well, how many twelve year olds do you know that do drugs and drink? And we can't be friends with your gamer tag, anyway.
 




 No. I actually like archery and do not strive to be like Katniss. 




 I do. But I only browse subreddits that don't have . ..... Adult content. 




 
Black ops 1, cod ghosts, terraria, minecraft, the walking dead video game series, etc. 




 I do not look at that adult stuff. Sometimes I do if it's not about, like , sex or whatever . But it's not like I intentionally go to bad subreddits. I never click "random subreddit" because I know what could happen. 




 I know that. I also know that r/watchpeopledie is not something I want to browse. 




 2002 may 




 I concur  




 Yes yes yes but NOOOOOO 




 Nothing 




 I have never watched it, but have been planning to. On school days, I wake up at six, walk to school, walk home, do homework, go to soccer, come home, eat dinner, shower , then go night night and repeat. Since I'm on break or on the weekends I visit my moms house the most I can, come home Sunday, go to sleep, play xbox, back to school. Consoles are only allowed on the weekends 




 It's Dystopian Fiction, which I like, set in the future where the world is split up into five different sections. Just find my xbox live account and my bio will tell you :P. Just read it. I have recommended it to all of my friends, teachers, my mom, and my step-mom. Although my friends haven't read it, 'cause books, everyone I know is obsessed and crystal at the end. It's really intense and action packed with people jumping off of moving trains. But then there's like a pinch of a crush turns into a pinch of a crush for him, but in the last book it WOULD not have turned out the same without him. It's just, amazing. Read it. Pm when your done 




 It's fun. I don't think I should be talking to someone with that username though......... 




 Archery is really fun, I read the hunger games and I was like, I wanna try that! But now I don't like archery because of the hunger games I like that satisfying thud when I hit a ten. And I know how reddit has a lot of gross stuff but I only browse sections that are the most appropriate for me. Of course there is that one post on here about penises or something, but in didn't click it!!!!! Eww! And I know no other twelve year old girl that likes video games and the color black, but then there's those idiot guys that are like " OMG I'm a gamer now!!!!! I bought (way outdated game like world at war)!!!" 




 Ooh good question? Was it about unicorns?!! 




 Coolio 




 If you are about to go to bed why did you post this? can you sleep-comment?
 




 Hi I'm twelve and I'm really bored. I like soccer, archery, video games, laughter, and the Divergent and Hunger Games book series. AMA!! 




 I'm guessing it's about airplanes. I'll watch it sometime over break 




 I don't really care anymore since I purchased the xbox one, but thanks for the tip! 




 The only thing I can do is delete stuff, which I have tried and I want/need everything I have OR I can change the memory unit to cloud but for some reason that option isn't available when I go into Halo 4 




 Will do. Unless you are joking with me and the movie is unrated and I will get grounded. 




 I love halo, too. But when I bought Halo 4, you have to download all of the game types onto the xbox and I have like no storage left so I wasted sixty bucks on a game I can only stare at and say I have 




 I come home at 3:00, do homework, go to soccer at 4:00, come home at 7:00, eat at 8:00, shower and do all that good stuff, and then go to bed.  




 I really like those too,; I like pretty much every variety of games, but I recently got Ghosts for Christmas and thought it was a lot better then other Call of Duty's. 




 Or a phone. I see third graders with iPhone 5s gold's but I don't even have a firefly (a phone that only calls parents and home) 




 None of my friends have a bedtime. If they do, it's 11:00. It is now "normal schedule"  to have no bedtime 




 I love Ace Ventura. a little inappropriate, but alright 




 Lately, I have been obsessed with COD ghosts. Don't worry, I'm fine. My grades are very high and I love reading and I always find a way to get in good with my teachers. I say I like a certain series.... BAM!!!!!  A 4 on reading. And I'm only allowed to play on my consoles on the weekends, so I'm fine 




 My parents know I use reddit and I often tell funny jokes I found on here.
My grades are fine, math isn't hard yet! We are only in algebra.
I'm twelve. I don't even know what cannabis is. 




 SPOILERS****

I feel that tris is too pretty in the movie. The whole book series she is telling herself she is ugly and in Allegiant when the are about to have sex, she says that she is pale, weak, and flat chested. She is none of these in the trailer. 




 ALRIGHTY THEN!!!!!! - Ace Ventura 




 My bedtime is 9:00, but we are currently on Christmas break until the 9th. 




 I prefer xbox. 




 I recently got an xbox one, but I have an Xbox 360 and a ps3. I enjoy first person shooters, but I like other games like minecraft and Terraria 




 I'm twelve years old and live in California(U.S.) and I love playing video games! I have an update for black ops two right now so I'm really bored and it's taking forever so ask away!!! 




 What part of California do you live in? 




 In all capitals, type in SDRAWKCAB. Its in a snow biome, there is floating islands, giant hills, and much more! By far my favorite seed  




 GT: Jade Sueta. I will be on a lot the next couple of weeks and a lot of today.

 You can make an infinite water source next to your moat. I dont know how to do a water pump but just make a 2 by 2 hole one block deep and take a water bucket and pour it in the corner. Do the same the exact opposite the corner with the water and Voila! Take water as much as you want from the hole  




 Hey i an help

 Yaaaay i love them! 




 Jade Sueta. Ill help you out and play with ya. 




 Now i am since i clicked the link. 




 Well, Allegiant would be rated R, because of the sex, but the other movies should be okay i think 




 And they don't mention Marcus at all in the trailer and that worries me. 




 The trailer makes it look like this is a love story. Sure, she is in love with Tobias, but it looks like they take out the action. That one sneak peak we get with the cheesy music is part of the love story. I hope it more action than love in the real movie 




 Haha shovelface i l o l ed 




 I thought the Hunger Games was about what Suzanne Collins thinks of reality tv.... That it is so stupid where people enjoy watching kids kill each other. 




 I hope its not the next hunger games. I loved the books, and Catching Fire was great, but SOOO many people havent read the book. I want Divergent to be popular to where only people who have read the book see the movie even though that eill never happen :P 




 Jade sueta is my name. I have a mic 




 Jade Sueta. Ill be on tomorrow 




 What does that do? 









 Relevant username  




 When Ezra was A. 




 Why? 




 Today? Will it be running today? 




 As you can read from the title it says that i want to go to the End. I currently have a mic but dont use it often. Anyone can join, you dont need a mic but i prefer one. I will be on for multiple hours today if anyone wants to beat the ender dragon with me. GT: Jade Sueta 




 Ill play. gT: Jade Sueta 




 Jade sueta is my gamertag 




 How will you speak too that H-o-o-o-o-rse. WHAT DOES THE FOX SAY 




 I really hope its not and that ezra just found the lair. But yes, it showed it right there, so i think its Ezra 




 Have you written anything yet?  




 I don't know if this is bad or good..... 




 Stapling water to a tree. Not everything is possible, people!!! 




 Jade Sueta is the name, im happy to play the game! 




 I might be on tomorrow. GT: Jade Sueta 




 I can see why people think that, since that is what they grow up with. A tv show I don't like that is old is Lizzy Mcguier or however you say her name. A tv show I don't like now is Dog with a blog. That is teaching kids that animals can speak because then they will try to talk to their dog like they are a human and annoy the shit out of their parents. But who doesn't like sponge bob???? 




 Please be under the age of sixteen  




 Yeah what's your user?
