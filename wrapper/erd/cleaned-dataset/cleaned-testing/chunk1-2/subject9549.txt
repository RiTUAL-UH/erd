 You really don't want to fake it. If you feel you absolutely have to, you have to be careful so you don't get caught in a lie. But really, it's best to use your real experiences and just make it sound good. You can tweak small things. But don't ever put a job you didn't do! There are ways to find out if you actually did it or not. 

By honors I just mean academic awards/achievements. Like does you school have an honor roll (distinction for making good grades)? 

Those skills are a good start. Employers tend to want people who are excellent communicators and being able to speak multiple languages is a plus. 

You can definitely include sports, especially if sports are really all you have. If you did get most improve award, that could show you can learn new skills quickly and effectively. 

Think about the skills sports have taught you and how you can apply them to the work force. Were you punctual to all practices? Are you a team player / do you work well in a group? Did you learn excellent time management skills (having to balance sports with academics)? Are you dedicated / do you have a strong work ethic? Were you ever a leader - did you ever effectively communicate between all your team members? Did you ever have to solve conflicts amongst team members? Are you used to working under pressure? Can you work with all types of people? If any of these things apply to you, put them on your resume. Employers are looking for these things - they want to see that you can work with people, that you can solve conflicts, and that you are reliable.

 It's been a year since I studied conditioning, but I believe an unconditioned response can be replaced by a conditioned response. An unconditioned response cannot be created. Instead, it is a reflexive response elicited by a stimulus without learning. For example, whenever dogs see food, they salivate. The salivation in response to seeing food is a reflexive response, thus making it an unconditioned response. 

Now, a conditioned response is a learned response, and that can be changed or unlearned. In /u/tossedidiot's example, before the experiment the girl probably responded to the bunny with either indifference or by wanting to pet it - this is an unconditioned response. But then experimenters added a loud noise (a neutral stimulus) which would make the girl cry. Pairing the loud noise with the bunny made the girl learn to cry whenever she saw the bunny. The crying is now a conditioned response (NOT an unconditioned response). In this instance, the conditioned response COULD have be unlearned if the experimenter's were to repeatedly present the bunny without the loud noise OR they could use positive reinforcement (such as giving the girl candy whenever she went near the bunny or whatever).

**TL;DR** An unconditioned response is a reflexive response to something, but it can be changed in that a conditioned response replaces it.

 Ah, resumes. What fun! My husband graduated from college in May and I helped him with his resume. I took a class that helps with finding jobs, so I'll post some tidbits from a handout I received. 

**TL;DR** - Objective is 1-2 sentences; Use standard fonts like Times New Roman or Arial; Include information that pertains specifically to the position for which you're applying (don't put in useless information just to "fill" your resume); Describe activities in terms of results and accomplishments; Show you're a "doer" by using action words such as "accomplished", "initiated", "established", etc when describing your activities; Make sure your resume format is consistent; Read the job description/advertisement for the job and use any words the employer used to describe the job; Grammar and spell check!; You can put a "spin" on things to make yourself sound better, but never ever ever EVER lie on your resume. 

**The Objective**
The objective is a concise, one- or two-sentence statement that appears as the first major section of 
your resume. It communicates two things: what sort of job you are seeking, and what skills you have to offer. 
There are many different approaches to writing a job or career objective. Most styles focus on elements such as 
the position, the field, or the job-seekers particular skills. You may also choose to create an objective that is 
made up of a combination of those elements. Your objective may be oriented to: 
* The position  for example, A position as a social worker providing services for the aged. 
* The field  for example, Desire a position in the social service field working with youth. 
* Your skills  for example, A position utilizing counseling, research, and proposal-writing skills. 
* A combination  for example, Seeking a position as a public relations officer in a medical facility. Wish 
to utilize skills in communications, needs analysis, and photography. 

Another option is to write an objective that states both a starting position and a long-range goal. Therefore, your objective may be written to focus on: 
*Results  for example, A sales position utilizing strong organizational skills and the ability to work on a 
self-directed basis, where I can develop a sales territory and generate new business. 
*A long-range goal  for example, To secure a management trainee position with a large department store 
with eventual goal of becoming a store manager. 

**Font   Format**
Font choices should be classic: Arial, Times New Roman, or Tahoma are traditional, professional, and easy-to read. Font size should range between 10- and 12-point, with the only exception being your name, which is usually written a few points larger. Bolding, italics, underlining, and all-caps can be used effectively to emphasize headings and create a visual break between information. There is no prescribed way of making these choices, but be consistent.

When printing your resume, use high-quality stock paper of at least 20-pound weight that is available at most print shops and office supply stores. Conservative white, off-white, tan or light gray are generally acceptable colors.

Your resume should be crisp and clean looking, and visually appealing to the reader. Use white space effectively. Avoid cramming and crowding. Use spacing to accentuate sections 
and headings

Normally a one-page resume will be sufficient. In virtually no instance should your resume exceed 
two pages. Make sure your descriptions of your work experience and/or extracurricular activities are results-oriented. Describe activities in terms of results and accomplishments.

Make revisions, and make sure there aren't mistakes.

**Experience**
Don't worry if you've had limited or no experience. By customizing your resume, you can present your accomplishments and experiences in an effective way in  relation to the position for which you are applying. If you have difficulty expanding upon your work experience, or are concerned your jobs werent glamorous or relevant, the following may be helpful: 
* First, describe your responsibilities using action words such as created, planned, analyzed, or 
initiated. Show you are a doer. You can probably find a list of words online, or I have one if you want it.
*Next, think about the transferable skills you gained from each experience. Examples of transferable skills 
include oral or written communication, interpersonal skills, working effectively in a team, leadership, and 
research or analytical skills. They are transferable because you build on them and carry them with you as 
you move from job to job. Employers often value these abilities as much as, if not more than, technical skills. 
* Finally, ask yourself which of your job duties and accomplishments will matter most to the employers you 
will be pursuing, and place those most prominently on the work experience portion of your resume. For each 
job, develop (typically) two to four phrases or sentences, using your lists of action words and transferable 
skills, which describe your key responsibilities and achievements. 
* You will also benefit from considering the description or advertisement for the job to which you are applying. 
Look for keywords that the employer uses to describe the skills and qualifications being sought for the position. Identify overlap between skills you possess and skills the employer is seeking, and be sure to emphasize those phrases and keywords in your resume.

Remember to include any honors you've received.

 Woo! I am about to graduate with a degree in English - Creative Writing. Have an upvote for busting the myth that all people with creative writing degrees work as baristas.

 Interesting. The coin is the same on both sides, which made me think it wouldn't be legal tender, but I wasn't sure. Thanks for the information! 









 I still have hope that we will see LSH on the show, and let me explain why.

Did anyone watch How I Met Your Mother? While the show was still on air, fans had a theory that the mother was dead the whole time. Then in an interview the actress who played the mother debunked that theory, saying it was just a ridiculous conspiracy theory created by fans and that the mother is not dead. Guess what fucking happened on the last episode? So, the actress lied about the show's ending!

What is the moral of this story? Trust no one. People who are involved with making shows lie all the time to throw off fans. Thus, I hope they haven't officially decided to not include LSH.

Edit: Stupid autocorrect. 




 My school's English club has had the same issue as you. Our member involvement has been very low. Last semester, we seriously only had about 5 active members. I know one reason why we've had low involvement is because very few people know we exist, and even fewer know what we even do. So first and foremost, I would say promote your club as much as possible! Hang up posters, ask professors in the English department to inform their students about the club, go where students hang out the most and hand out flyers, or even have tshirts made and have members wear them.

At my college, people love volunteering. I would considering finding a way to get your club involved with volunteer activities. For instance, last semester my club did a book drive. First, we had people bring in old books they didn't use any more, then we sold them for pretty cheap (anywhere from $.25 to $1 each) on campus. We raised about $500 and all proceeds went to our local children's hospital so they could buy books for their library. You could do some sort of fundraising event for local organizations that promote literacy. 

Another thing you could do just for fun is a book swap. I know people want to read books, but books are expensive to buy or they just can't find something good to read. So you could throw a small party or something and have people bring old books they don't want and they can swap books with other people. 

People love contests and prizes. You could hold writing competitions. My group is planning on holding a campus wide poetry contest and the winner will get something like a small gift card to a local restaurant or bookstore or something. So hold flash fiction contests, poetry contests, things like that and give away small prizes.

Our club also has it's own publication, a literary magazine which accepts and publishes the best analytical essays. We were able to get a grant to help with the costs of printing and whatnot since it's professional, but I guess you could do the printing and stuff on your own if you want to do it on a smaller scale. We accept submissions from late fall through early spring and publish the magazine late spring. Once submissions are closed, we read through everything and pick the best, then we do light editing (spelling and grammar). You could consider starting something like this, and you can publish any type or writing (creative or academic) you want. If you guys like creative writing, you could put together a magazine of poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, novel excerpts, etc. People at my school love this. The group in charge gets to act as editors and students get their work published, both of which look good on resumes.

Hold open mic events. Invite people to come and read poetry or an excerpt from a short story they've written. Make sure to have popcorn or pizza to draw people in, or you could ask to hold the event at a local coffee house. 

Do you have a local company that puts on plays? We have a local Shakespeare company, and every year we get together as a group and see a play. 

People love free stuff, so offer free pizza or any free food or whatever at meetings.

That's all I can think of for now. In short, promote your club as much as possible and offer free stuff. Good luck!

 I originally posted on /r/pics, but this subreddit seems to be more appropriate... 

As the title says, my parents called today to say they had to put our dog down. Sammie was 16; he would've been 17 in October. His health had been pretty poor for years now (he was blind and couldn't hear or walk well), but he was one strong pup. 

My parents gave him to me as a Christmas present when I was 5 years old. Today, I'm 22, married, and about to graduate college, so this dog has been around for a lot of major events in my life. It's like my childhood officially died with him. 

[A few pictures of Sammie.](http://imgur.com/a/0VvC0)

You were the first dog I ever had, Sam-Sam. Thank you for all the memories, for being a loyal companion, for teaching me responsibility, and for making me feel like I always had a friend. I am going to miss you.

Edit: Spelling 




 Thanks. I wasn't sure which place would be better... Perhaps I'll move over there.

 /u/sympathyboner is right about seeing the doctor and possibly getting a new pill.

I had a very similar experience with Lo Loestrin. I would have light breakthrough bleeding ALL THE TIME and I would miss my periods. My doctor changed my pill to Generess Fe a few months ago and everything is back to normal.

Also, since you mentioned that you were stressed, keep in mind that stress can screw up your period.

I hope all is well :) 




 "Irregardless" drives me insane. It's "regardless" you illiterate swine! 









 One day while playing Skyrim I traveled to the house where my family was living and my [adopted son was walking around in his underwear](http://i.imgur.com/mdPdVIp.jpg)

Edit: Sorry for potato quality, btw. 
























 I was a very laid back bride for the most part. I didn't care what anyone did as long as it wasn't drastic. My bridesmaid got a nose piercing before my wedding, but I didn't care because she offered to find a way to conceal it for the wedding (and she did). My sister cut her hair and dyed it a couple weeks before the wedding, and again I didn't care because it wasn't anything that would cause a distraction.

HOWEVER. The day of my wedding, my mother in law showed up with her hair dyed fire red. She flat out admitted she did it the night before the wedding. When we first saw each other that day, I was in my dress, waiting for pre wedding photos to start. She walked up to me and without even acknowledging how I looked in my dress she said "How do you like my hair?!" I was FURIOUS simply because she didn't ask if it was okay and because it was a HUGE change and therefore a huge distraction - EVERYONE was talking about it at the wedding. Whenever I look at the wedding photos that anger returns. She stands out the most in all the photos. Her hair looked absolutely awful with the wedding colors, including her dress color. 

The point of this is: don't do anything that will distract from and/or upset the bride. It is, after all, her and her future husband's day. She only gets to be a bride once, so don't let anything upset her. So, if you're sister is not okay with it, wait until after the wedding to make changes to your hair.  




 I really wish I had some advice for you :( I am  terribly sorry. But thank you for the warning. My husband purchased my engagement ring from Kay's in 2011. I was considering taking it to them sometime soon since the white gold has faded, but I definitely will not do that now. 

Also, I've read horror stories in which people take their rings to Kay's to be repaired and upon return they received fake rings or diamonds. If you do get your ring back, I would check to make sure everything is legit. 

Again, I'm sorry this happened to you, and I hope you get some sort of compensation. I would love an update in the future.  




 My husband and I ate dinner at Tony's while on our honeymoon last summer. If you're looking for something romantic yet casual I would recommend it. We got a picture of us almost kissing while eating the same piece of spaghetti like they did in Lady and the Tramp. We're are so cheesy! 




 I am living in Kentucky, attending a state university, can confirm that they can be god awful...

Despite my parents telling me I should choose an inexpensive Kentucky college, I chose to attend a pretty expensive university in Ohio and found the debt wasn't worth it for what I was studying (English and education).  Even with a large scholarship, it was fucking expensive. Also, all the professors and employees (such as in the financial aid office) and even some of the students were snooty and unfriendly. So, I switched to a school in Kentucky and found their program isn't too terrible. I was skeptical about switching to this KY school because I had heard people had so many issue with it: wayyyyy too many students, financial aid is fucking useless, parking sucks dick since it's a commuter school, there's favoritism, and some other random things (shit gets lost or mixed up by people in the bursar and registrar offices all the time it seems)... But I didn't find any of these issues to be that big of a problem. The professors in my department are AMAZING. It seems most professor through the university (not just in my own department of English) are pretty good. However, there are some, mostly those who are adjuncts teaching lower level courses or core university courses, are god awful and just don't give a shit. Also, a lot of the students are...well...idiots, and I honestly have no clue how they made it to college (one girl in my class thought Australia is in Europe...). But overall I'm happy with my decision to switch from a prestigious out of state school to a not-so-prestigious in state school. 

You should base your decision partly on what you plan on doing in the future. If you want a career that won't make a whole ton of money, you obviously don't want a lot of debt... That's one of the reasons why I transferred to my local Kentucky school. The Ohio school cost $30,000 a year (I, fortunately, after scholarships only had to pay $10,000). However, I was originally going to school for teaching which only makes $30k a year!

TL;DR: The Kentucky schools are hit or miss. People either love them or hate them (and it also depends on the school... I know people from every big KY school, so I can tell you what people have said about them). Think about your expected salary after college when picking the college...

Edit: Remember that if you stay in Kentucky, you'll get KEEs money if you're eligible... Free money right off the bat just for staying within the state! That's always a plus. 

And one Kentucky college I would recommend looking into is Murray State. My husband absolutely loved it there. It's not shitty like other state colleges.  




 As someone else has noted, this is nepotism. We had this happen in my university's English club before. The only way we fixed it was when new board members, who recognized that there has been problems with nepotism in the past, came to be in "power." We decided that all future board members have to run a campaign and be elected by other student members - so our club president doesn't appoint board members, as your club seems to do. We also have a professor who oversees everything, and she now has the power to remove people from office and appoint new people if things aren't working out. 

Does your club have a professor (or some other university official) who has authority over the club? I don't know if this is possible, but if there are enough complaints, is it possible to "impeach" the club president and have new elections?

It's up to you whether or not you want to do something about it. In my opinion, it's not right when people who don't deserve positions get them. Then again, the world isn't always fair, and you're going to encounter situations like this in the "real world" too, not just in college.

Edit: spelling 




 I am so terribly sorry you are being dragged through this situation. It sounds like your wife has issues, but has trouble figuring out what they are. All I can say, like many others, is counseling. I truly hope everything works out for the best.  




 Im sorry, I wasn't trying to speak of it lightly - didn't mean to make kids sound disposable like a puppy or something because kids are serious business. There are some people not meant to have kids, I know that. I'm just asking OP if his wife has ever seriously considered kids and if she has given a legitimate reason for not wanting kids... I mean, it sounds like she would try to take care of a child if she had one by accident so why doesn't she want to have a baby purposely? I'm also curious as to how she hates children since she, as OP claims, has had a limited experience with them (and what is this limited experience, and did the limited experience play a role in her not wanting kids?). I also feel that she's making an excuse when she says she doesn't want kids because she doesn't have maternal instincts since some women, at least as I've seen, can have the instinct kick in once they have a child of their own. I just want to know if there's a hidden reason why she doesn't want kids: saying she hates kids, especially when she doesn't have experience with them, sounds like a sketchy reason to me, but that's just me. 

In short, I want to know why the wife won't keep an open mind about kids, why she's so adamant on not wanting them when she hasn't had much experience. 

Sorry if I made it sound like she should just have one and pray to god she doesn't hate it because I wasn't trying to say that... 

Edit: rearranged things... 




 Just something I am curious about... You say that your wife has barely been around kids, yet she hates them. How can she absolutely hate kids if she hasn't has much experience with them? What about kids does she hate? Does she hate the idea of having to raise a child? Or does she hate how annoying they can be? Could it be that she hates kids because she's only been around other people's unruly or misbehaved children (meaning she's only seen the negative side of children/raising children)? 

Also, I know women who once absolutely hated kids and felt they had no maternal instinct whatsoever, but once they had kids of their own they love them as any parent would love their child. Sometimes maternal instincts doesn't kick in until you have your own child. So, you can hate children, but it seems people have different attitudes toward kids when it's their own child. I loathe other people's children at times - you know, children whose parents allow them to scream nonstop or run around and be all annoying - at times I worry I won't be able to able kids either. I also hate how gross they can be and worry I won't be able to handle diapers and whatnot... but at the same time, I feel my maternal instincts will be stronger when I have a kid of my own, making me a good mom. Plus, I also know my husband will be extremely supportive and will be a wonderful father.  

Has your wife ever taking that into consideration? That her maternal instincts will kick in once she has a child, and you'll both be wonderful parents?  




 Touch...  




 Two words: pocket pussy... 




 Wow! I am insanely jealous. I am happy they waived it  




 I'm terribly sorry you feel the way you do about your body. I would agree that a therapist is your best bet. Are there no services that offer any type of free counseling in your area?  I agree you probably have body dysmorphia - definitely search the internet and read about it. There are online support groups you can join, or you could just read through people's advice on how to overcome this. 

I am 5'9" and I weigh 140 and sometimes I feel overweight as well. But let me tell you what I'm beginning to learn: being skinny is overrated. At your height and weight, you're not overweight; you're probably curvy like I am. Some men (and women too!) absolutely love curves - they're quite sexy. You have to learn somehow to embrace your body, love it. Honestly though, if you're curvy, and not just skin and bones, that's a good sign that you're healthy, and that's what's most important. 

Also, you've overcome anorexia? Wow! I'm sure that was tough. That's something to be extremely proud of. That shows that you are strong and capable of getting better. 

I wish you the best of luck in feeling better with yourself. Be positive. And find some support from people who know what you're going through. 

Edit: spelling and whatnot.  




 As one user has said, colleges tend to care about the money. Often, they don't have souls and don't care about people. My husband took classes over the summer at a local community college a few years back, and he went to the registrar office and asked to have the classes dropped before the deadline. He assumed everything was fine. Then he got a notice saying he owed the school money. Apparently somehow his classes didn't get dropped - his paperwork got lost, so there was no proof he had dropped his classes on time. We were in financial hardship then (and trying to afford a wedding as well). Long story short, regardless of our hardship, he had to pay the school back in full. 

Meanwhile, I was attending a very expensive Catholic university. Despite having scholarships and loans, I didn't have enough to cover the cost so my parents paid $5000 out of pocket every semester. My grandmother died suddenly, sending my mom in a deep depression that caused her to stop attending work, which caused my parents to have a lot of money issues. My dad and I filed paperwork to get more loans or some sort of assistance from the university. They denied it. 

I'm sorry if this discourages you, but like I said, many universities just don't care. 

So here's my advice: try like hell to get the school to understand you are in hardship. Be polite and truthful, and do not accuse the college of being evil or anything. Tears could be beneficial. Maybe you'll get lucky and they will care. Be prepared for the worst though. If you have to pay the money back, try for a loan. Whoever said you should calculate how much those 3.5 hours of class time costs has a good idea, that sounds fair to me, hopefully they could go for that... 

Also, take this situation as a life lesson. Be sure you always know what you're getting yourself into, and always know and meet deadlines.

 My husband and I went to DQ last summer and most of the games   rides were broke... Would not recommend. 




 For some crazy reason, my first thought was "Oh, so Daario is Jon's penis?" 




 The high school I graduated from visits first graders every year and gives them "class of" shirts... No idea why.  




 Here is my two cents. Do not be afraid to talk to your girlfriend about things like this.  Don't be afraid to ask "What do you think about me getting you a promise ring?" I don't understand why men propose without ever seriously talking to their girlfriend about it first.  I guess men want the girl to be surprised, which is great, but you need to make sure that the girlfriend is on the same page and wants the same things. The girl can drop hints about wanting it, but that's not talking about it. 

Also, don't worry if it's "too soon." If you feel the time is right, then the time is right. My husband and I got engaged four months after we had first met and only three months of dating. I was 19, he was 20, we were both sophomores in college. My husband and I talked about getting engaged after only a month of dating. We talked about it, then talked some more, then talked even more. We talked the subject to death, making sure we were always on the same page - and we always were! When we got engaged, we got a lot of shit about it being too soon and everyone said we wouldn't last. We remained engaged for two years before we got married and now we are very happily married. 

So, don't let anyone tell you it's too soon. No one can tell if you the time is right except you and your girlfriend. So before you decide to take a step forward in your relationship, have a very serious conversation with your girlfriend, and do it only if you both decide it is the right move.  




 I got married last summer at Pattison Park in Batavia. They have a gazebo for the ceremony and a lovely lodge for the reception which can seat up to 250 people. The park itself is across the road and has a few picnic shelters and a lake.
