 If you're rooting the thing then 99% of everything I said is of moot consequence.

The hardware of the device is pretty much badass. .... with the one exception of the speaker.  the speaker sucks. it's on the back of the phone, easily covered up, is about as 'generic' as possible, and pales in comparison to even an average 'other' device.. let alone HTC's speakers... which are even better than my 14" Asus laptop...  leaving one of them playing music on my counter and walking around the kitchen serves almost the same function audio-wise... with the M8 actually edging out on certain aspects because the case of the laptop 'rattles' a bit on the higher notes.

the M8's speakers are great. I'll oftentimes have music playing on my phone when I get in my car and just set the thing in my cupholder and forget to even turn the radio on... just keep listening to the phone.  there are limitations, i mean, they *are* tiny speakers ... so, road noise can drown it out but.... my point is,  they're pretty freakin' awesome speakers.

aside from that... from everything I'm reading about the rumors with the G4... the only real difference will be the octa-core proc... and, the speed of both the G3 *and* the M8 are more than fast enough, imo.  ...hell, at that, from what I've been gathering on the chip specs/performance, the 4 main cores of the Snapdragon really aren't that much faster than the 4 cores in the 801. ... slightly but just barely-so... albeit, greater efficiency in layout of the chip, and smaller wiring.. so less battery drain *when* the 4 'main' cores are in use... ...as well, the ability to not only drop back to the 4 'half' cores for easier tasks... drastically reducing power consumption, but *also* the ability to utilize all 8 cores at once... ...and, if what I was reading is correct, better bandwidth from the ram *to* the proc so that all 8 cores don't experience bottlenecks in memory access.

but, again, really is a pretty moot thing. speed gains would be minimal, and I've never had a speed problem on either device (nor a ram-problem.. and the G3/G4 both are 3gb ram... M8 = 2gb).

battery life may increase... but, since it looks like they're sticking with a 5.5" screen with the g4.. but going for the increased resolution (3k vs 2k) ... it may be a wash... ....if you chose to keep the settings to 'max output' all the time....otherwise, if you keep it variable, the battery life would prob be just-slightly gained with the G4 over G3.

Kinda moot talking about or comparing given the G4 isn't even announced yet, let alone available ... 

but, my point is... even if waiting for the G4, the only real difference seems to be the jump up in proc-type (like the M9) and a slightly increased screen resolution (but the G3 *still* has higher res than the M9.... ....and, even my M8's resolution is more than high enough imo. te increased resolution of the G3 has never really been a noticeable 'thing' to me).

um... rooting   roms.  to each their own. I'm on sprint so I can't even root my G3, let alone load a different ROM on it.. but, I'm not sure I'd (really) want to anyway.  the only thing i'd really want to root my phone for would be to make it a wifi-server for my laptops and tablets.... and, at that, I use EasyTether on it with no problems... ...just requires a usb cable which, also, keeps it charged... using the phone as a modem drains the battery like none-other... esp with heavy usage... so, keeping it plugged in is something I do anyway.

that's actually where I keep my phone 99% of the time... in the back of my car plugged into an old laptop that's, in turn, plugged into a 12v power outlet in the back and all shoved into a side-net deal....... and i use the laptop/G3-combo as a mobile hotspot for my laptops   tablets while I'm in or around my car. 

The downtime is minimal, and the G3 seems perfectly 'happy' plugged in back there.  I only really ever remove it when I'm going away from my car and need to grab it to use as a modem wherever I'm going... assuming that place doesn't have wifi.  ... or 4g/LTE so my M8 can't serve both functions (modem *and* phone).

anyway, I've never had problems with my M8 in the nearly 2 years I've owned it. I consider it one of the best devices I've ever owned. but the G3 is still a solid phone, and any of the (not really existent) 'problems' with optimus will be replaced with the ROM.... .... I'm not *against* the G3, hell, I'm even *for* it... again, Infiniti makes a damn nice car! ... I'd be glad to own one. not just happy, but happy+.... but, vs an Audi?  that fucker's *fun* to drive! not just a pleasant drive when going somewhere, I specifically intentionally *make up* places to go with my Audi... just so i can drive it... ...same deal with the M8.  ...can't say that about my G3.

([this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA15T2MC0213 cm_re=acer_switch_10-_-9SIA15T2MC0213-_-Product) is my other 'favorite device' I have.  it's slower than my laptop, definitely *not* my desktop... but, for $200, I love this fucking thing!) 




  maybe I can add BlackBerry as being Jaguar

that one makes perfect sense! used to be great, now is just a Ford. Has less problems than it used to, but still costs an arm   a leg and gives subpar performance relative to the competition.

 Nokia (Microsoft I guess) can be Volvo

another perfect fit! definitely not the 'best' out there, but certainly still a great device... and those old box volvos from the late 80's-90's were super popular (like that old school nokia phone that *everyone* had and seemed to last for.f'ing.ever with no problems... could be dropped (wrecked) repeatedly and just. keep. going.  kinda boring, but an otherwise solid device.

perfect comparisons 




 imo, the M9 is just HTC catching up with what LG provided with the G3 a year ago.... actually, the G3 has a larger battery... that's swappable!, higher res screen, and a camera that's probably better than the M9.   the only real loss with going with a G3 *instead* of an M9 is the new processor... but, proc speeds are way faster in smartphones than most people could ever demand of them.

that just leaves price   ui.  personally? I'm a really big fan of Sense. period.    Optimus is great, but it isn't Sense.

I have the M8, I have the G3.  I can use both interchangeably, just gotta go in and adjust my google-voice settings to forward the calls from one to another.

at that, I almost never carry my G3. I've made myself for a month once. I grab it every once in a while and use it even now... forceably. begrudgingly. 

I just ... it isn't that Optimus is '*bad*', by comparison to every other UI that's out there (except sense) it's great! ...but, it lacks the simplicity yet functionality of sense.

I know that sounds horribly semantic   anal but... it's just how I perceive it.

at that, between the M8   G3, I'd take the M8 any day of the week and twice on sunday... ...*despite* it being a 'lesser phone'.  it has less ram, smaller screen, less battery/life, non removable battery, etc... but, the ram / speed is plenty and I'm pretty liberal with the number of apps i install and keep on there... keep running in the background, etc.

The only real limitation to the M8 vs the G3, imo is the camera. the camera absolutely blows in the M8. i mean, for basic shots? it's 'fine', but, there are many pictures that I've tried to take and been disappointed in.  The G3's camera is great.

on the other hand, cameras are much less important to me so this limitation (though supposedly 'fixed' in the E9... *not* the M9... that camera lacks image stabilization and, from what I've seen, it's a major limitation... the E9's is strongly rumored to have it)... ...where the M8 absolutely monkey-stomps the G3 on... and, most other 'devices' that I own (laptops, tablets, etc) ... is also one that's much more important to me to begin with: speakers.

the G3's audio is paltry to begin with. Compare it to the M8 and it's like listening to.... a shitty pair of stock earbuds vs a really nice set of headphones that cover the ears entirely.    singular low quality speaker on the back vs dual high quality speaker*s* on the front.

it makes a huge difference. 

but, again, Optimus vs Sense. it's subtle. And, LG clearly did a very thorough job going through all the other handsets   tablets out there and narrowed down the best features. they did a great job at 'capturing the essence' of each out there... iOS, TouchWiz, Sense, etc....

and, did an awesome job programming it into Optimus... but, there're just a few features they lost, and, in day to day functionality, it makes all the difference in the world (to me) 




 Why not use them en mass? Why not keep the data indefinitely? Why not create tracking patterns of vehicles? Time/date/location/license plate # etc?

 




 I have both the M8 and G3. Much prefer my m8...shy of the camera.

Get an m9, or, better, hold off until the e9 is available.

Sense blows optimus away, imo 




 They'll get over it. Most already eat bugs all the time, they just don't realize it.

The environmental footprint/impact is certainly drastically reduced from my understanding.  I'd give it a few more years to get testing and widespread approval. But I'd imagine that by 2020 even t.supply    rural king will be selling the stuff 




 /r/drought cares. /r/californiadrought *really* cares. Like, cares so much it's its only reason for even existing


 




 Having both as G3 *and* an M8 for nearly a year now has made me realize I'm a bigger fan of HTC than I am LG.

I liken HTC to Audi, Samsung to BMW, iPhone to Mercedes, and LG to an Infiniti/Lexus hybrid.  I've always been an Audi guy. HTC the same. 

but, I've also owned a few Samsung devices (and bmws... and mercedes, and audis, and toyotas, and nissans... never a lexus or an infiniti.. though my parents   sisters have) ... ...it's a great device, for what it is... but, I'd much prefer the G3 over any samsung I've owned (tv's included).   ... but, even at that, HTC beats it. ...esp with the M9 essentially being a G3 with a newer proc (a year later *after* the G3 came out first).  the E9 on the other hand.... now *that*'ll be the device to have! 

Sense beats Optimus hands down. Optimus beats TouchWiz hands down. all of them beat iOS hands down.    I like mercedes, comfortable ride and will certainly get you there but... bah. boring! power? sure. those v8's are like tanks on crack... but, still tanks. the still-heavy but lighter Audi? granted not as fast as a BMW for the most part, but with the quattro? the handling blows it out of the water. throw on a supercharger for $5-6k on top of the naturally aspirated 4.2L v8 audi makes? ... combined with the handling on any road but a pure circle track and BMW can suck it. 

sure the gas will get'cha... charging my HTC is about as common as filling an Audi up with gas but.... well. fucking. worth. it.  and, come on, how far away is the average person from a car or wall outlet? and, even if they are, [these things](http://www.ebay.com/itm/2600mAh-Portable-Mobile-External-Battery-USB-Charger-for-cellphone-Power-Bank-/251719067117?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 var= hash=item3a9ba025ed) are $5.... and give nearly a 100% charge in of themselves. 

The G3 Optimus interface makes it cater more towards kids as some sort of 'toy' ... the HTC Sense is much more to the point, imo.... ironically, my business number is on my G3 and my personal number is on my HTC. luckily, google voice works with both and forwarding phone calls from my G3 *to* my HTC is just a 5-10 minute configuration issue.

that the HTC cost me $100 and the G3 $0? and that the G3 has basically the same specs (if not arguably better in some ways) than the just-announced M9? hell, even the yet-to-be-announce E9? ... all the more impressive. Infiniti makes some pretty bad ass car designs with some pretty advanced configuration-types. ...oftentimes *years* before the competition catches up.  Unfortunately, it's an Infiniti, not an Audi. 'cause Audi's fucking rock! that's why the bad guys drive 'em! ..and Tony Stark.  'RDJ' also does HTC commercials. This *isn't* a coincidence, fwiw 




  then the risk goes up exponentially as you increase the odds of a drone and an airplane trying to occupy the same space at the same time.

but the likelihood of this happening is so minimal...  I mean, airports with 'no drone/no fly' zones alone would drastically reduce the risk.  I mean, how often is a plane really flying low enough to hit a drone? ... take off   landing... that's about it.  initial ascent or descent but... again, 'no fly zones for drones' (said [Soup Nazi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVqBzP0xdKk)-style) would seemingly reduce this drastically.

That leaves small planes   helicopters ... and, again, the likelihood of this is so minimal, in my imagination, any helicopter that hits a drone... and... anyone that lets their drone be hit by a helicopter... was essentially asking for this seemingly nearly-entirely avoidable incident from happening. 




 it doesn't *just* bring down the price of feed, the birds are seemingly a lot healthier, happier, and grow more protein-dense meat, as well have the capability of growing 'plumper' in the process. ... depending on what *else* its fed, it can have a lot of meat. it can have a lot of fat. or it can have a lot of meat *with* a lot of fat.

insects tend to be really lean. they don't provide a lot of 'fat' to the animal, but... again, it's just a *part* of what's fed, not the entire thing.

but, better, they can be fed live, dead, or can be processed into various forms... kinda like soy basically. lots of potential here. 




 Why not do both?

Insects for humans *and* livestock? 




  If we allowed men a similar choice: before the fetus is too developed for a legal abortion, the father can choose - just as permanently and irreversibly as an abortion - to forever surrender all parental rights and responsibilities - without the consent of the mother

I've been arguing this for *years* now. Guys always cheer it, girls always think I'm scum.  ...but, within '30 days of notification' ... be it that the girl is pregnant or that a child even exists. ... so, some mother couldn't have the kid, struggle for years not having notified the father, get into some financial problems, then come back against the kid.  ... maybe even less time, but I feel '30 days' is a good amount of time in such that a 'rash decision' isn't made. 90 days depending on term of pregnancy would be even nicer...

but, the point is, guys have essentially no control over this. It isn't 'fair' really. I'm not arguing that it's 'right' or that it's a responsible or moral thing to do, but I think if an option for such a thing existed, there'd be a *lot* more thought towards having a kid with the idea being in the mother's head that she could always go after the father.

the question comes into play with what to do in the case of an unknown kid coming back against a parent for back child support. 

but, then, that would still apply, imo.  the father would have '30 days to decide' and, during that 30 days of finding out about this 18+ year old child of theirs, they can make the call on whether they want to try to be apart of its life ... ..or, say 'no' and keep going their own way.

if the father said 'yes' then never paid and the mother never came back for child support due to *not* wanting to play some sort of custody game ... that's different, the father has responsibilities and *didn't* follow their duty ... but, '30 days' (to 3 months) would be really nice.  ... and fair, imo.

granted, again, women the 'world over' would think of any father that does that as complete scum and 'not a man' but, whatever. that's for that father to deal with on an individual case scenario. 

but, you're absolutely right... something like what you typed would totally offer a way for this' monstrous crime' to have been prevented 




 ethanol from corn is stupid. Stupider still is that the US lets ethanol *only* come from corn (a few notable exceptions aside).

I'm not knocking ethanol (though it's clearly not as energy dense nor cost-effective as petroleum-based gasoline) ... I'm knocking ethanol from corn, esp when it's *only* from corn.

  I wouldn't volunteer to die today for it

well, if you change your mind.... you know where to find me :)

 I would gladly endorse feeding bugs to humans

I've posted *many* articles about this. I'm super-excited that this 'movement' is finally starting to pick up some steam. 

Insects are an excellent source of nutrients   protein.  Extremely efficient converters of resources, have an incredibly low pathogentohuman rate, and are incredibly fast growers. Of course an 'insect burger' would be about as delicious as a veggie soy burger deal the hippies eat ... so I don't see it replacing a big juicy cow of buff burger or anything... but, vs the 'whatever-tf-mc d's sells?' it'd probably taste *better* than what they try to pass off as 'beef'.  though, maybe better to start with the McD's in India first .. before taking it elsewhere. esp the US

 Australia 

I've seen aborigines eat bugs before. living ones at that. it wasn't for me but I was definitely offered.... I'd much prefer them cooked   seasoned than live   squirming 

 other perversions

again, don't disagree... as, again, I've posted many articles about insect eating.

 overpopulation

I think that people are too up in arms about this whole overpopulation water deal.   .... at least from the perspective that it *isn't* a 'solvable' problem.  as is? it's absolutely one. but, I've spent the past few *years* posting on reddit *various* ways to both address *and* mitigate the current problems.

I see no reason why the carrying capacity of the planet couldn't be 25, 50, maybe even 100 billion people.  though it'd get a bit crowded   uncomfortable at those levels... i see no reason it isn't *plausible* at least ... if not fully *possible*.   hopefully by then we're off the planet and terraforming Mars or Europa or something though... and/or have figured out some way to build land from water or something.   ... graphene-islands would be neat :)

but, *on* the over population deal... again, if you change your mind, you know where to find me ... :) 




 The Likud party is even worse than the US's neocon wing of the republican party.

I'm assuming, of course, that you're willing to volunteer to be one of the first towards this population-reduction you seem to think we need 




 it's in the bond-type of the atoms.... as well what they're bound to.

in SOC (soil organic carbon), the carbon is usually bound to other types of atoms ... these molecules are more easily broken down.

In biochar, the carbon is (for the most part) bound to other carbon.  and, *usually* not just with one electron being shared, but two or more sometimes even...

here're some links that may help

[Total Organic Carbon](http://soilquality.org/indicators/total_organic_carbon.html)

[Wikipedia: Soil carbon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_carbon)

Also, try google-image searching: '[biochar atoms](https://www.google.com/search?q=biochar+atoms newwindow=1 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=4mwCVaHbJcS6ggSw-4HgCA ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ biw=1745 bih=814)' and looking at some of the models/representations of the atomic structure.

note that in, say, [this one](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UJf2hWRhpFc/Um1ScIcwuDI/AAAAAAAADYs/tNZBI8r2rYk/s1600/composition.jpg) some of the hexagons will have a 'second line' next to them.. ..this is to imply that it's a [double bond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bond) between the carbon atoms there.  Double bonds are, as I think is pretty easy to imagine, twice as hard to break as.. single bonds.  

in the above link, take how the ethylene pic has a C=C bond but the acetone has a c-c-c with the middle c having a = to the o ... 

 next up, check out a google-image-search for: '[graphene double bond](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1 biw=1745 bih=814 tbm=isch sa=1 q=graphene+double+bond oq=graphene+double+bond gs_l=img.3..0i24.31078.32651.0.32852.8.8.0.0.0.0.77.444.8.8.0.msedr...0...1c.1.62.img..7.1.54.MzZWQLXoT3M)'  ...now, [graphene](/r/graphene) by default will have a double-bond... it's kind of inherent to its structure ... but, in the 'chicken-wire-like' structure it makes... as you can clearly see, each (carbon) atom has a double bond with each carbon atom that surrounds it.

graphene is also stronger than diamond.  there's (most likely) a *lot* of naturally occurring graphene in biochar. ...and biochar could serve as a source-material of carbon *for* graphene ... if-ever 'they' can figure out how to produce it in the quantities society would 'gobble it up'. 

in graphene, the electrons are, in fact, shared among *three* carbon atoms. ...though this still makes a double-bond between each individual atom to the next, but, in 'properly made' graphene, the electron would be shared '*equally*' between the 3, with no single-atom having more of a 'hold' on the atom than either of the other two. ... think the whole 'turkey wishbone' deal ..

the more controlled the graphene is during production, the more 'balanced' or 'equally' the electron will be shared between each atom.  'grades' of graphene will undoubtedly be a major component within the manufacturing business ... with cars requiring a 'lower level of refinement' than, say, 'airplanes' which in turn will be lower-still than, say, a space shuttle.

but, on the other end, cars would be *higher* than, say, the graphene used to make a kids latest transformer toy. ...*despite* the latter probably being subjected to more abuse during its life *than* the car! 

but, backing out to biochar ... again, it's (almost) all in the pics! biochar isn't *just* carbon-carbon bonds, it's *mostly* carbon-carbon bonds...  but, due to its 'lower refinement' than, say, graphene, more 'impurities' are intermixed within the bonds... and, these 'impurities' (read: other elements) break down easier over time and, thus, the biochar itself does as well... the 'stuff' that usually lasts 100+ years is where the 'everything else' bonds the carbon're bonded to have broken down and... ...you get ever-smaller pieces of biochar that're the stronger c=c bonds.

there's nothing about this that matches the ELI5 but... i highly doubt that you're 5 either :)

oh, edit: the carbon in [compost](/r/composting) is 'organic carbon' ... as such, most of the carbon in it is bonded to 'other things' (atoms) than carbon... and, when it *is* other carbon atoms, they're usually single-bonds. (single electrons shared).  ... and, even if they aren't, even in the extremely rare cases where it's a double bond... and, even, 3-4 of them... (3-4 carbon atoms each double-bound to one another) ... it's not biochar.   biochar is that 'huge honeycomb-like chaotic pattern of porosity'.   ...well, for the most part. I'm pretty sure the IBI's definition of biochar was kept pretty. freakin'. vague. for a reason.

but, either way, compost = organic carbon. biochar = inorganic carbon usually where the carbon atoms are connected with double- to triple- bonds. 




 'taste tests' are often done on feed-types. I can't remember if I posted one or not, but there was a study done on feeding [black soldier fly](/r/blacksoldierfly) to both fish *and* cows, pigs, chickens... ...they could go as high as 40% and no taste difference was detected in the flavor of the meat. BSF, to focus on a specific one, are essentially neutral on flavor. 

But, in *one* of the studies I read on it, they specifically stated that they were following the protocols set out by the feed industry specifically *for* this type of 'taint' in flavor.

Animals eat bugs all the time. Chickens, fish, etc seem to go crazy for them in fact. 

Think about it, what's more unnatural: a cow being fed grains that it'd unlikely ever have access to in the wild or a cow eating a ladybug on a blade of grass? 

now, obviously there's a difference between a few random bugs here   there vs a diet based on a high percentage *of* bugs.... but, insect eating is pretty dang common.  and I'd be really surprised if someone actually showed me a study where the results showed a statistical increase in feed-type (in the wild!) of corn over, say, cockroaches.

now, obviously your message (which I had to interpret because it isn't the most clearly written thing out there) states that you don't feel like feeding things that the animal wouldn't normally come across naturally ... ie, grain-fed cattle (or sheep or goats) *aren't* something that you really support *either* ... .... totally agree. I have anecdotally tested grass vs grain fed cuts of meat on people and 7x out of 10 (which is about how many times I've ever actually personally tested this... ie, 10x) the person can taste a difference between the two ... *despite* my attempts probably half the time to lead them to the other.

again, anecdotal and probably has just as much if not more on my *extremely* ***non***-scientific way of testing this... but, in the way the flavor, texture, overall experience is describe, grass fed wins more often than not.

but, again, I imagine there're some bugs in there.. obviously not at the scale that they suggest here, but there nonetheless

 It would seem like the best way to approach this would be to determine what the markets he's able to sell to are most-demanding.

If he's going to stick with the local market, then figure out *who* locally he plans to sell to. If he can arrange for product to be shipped, then that will of course expand the markets   demand-types that he can cater towards.... but, again, demand will more often than not dictate what's grown and, as such, is probably best determined *first*?

at that, you may want to look into SPIN farming. One of the more foundational things about that is intensive monoculture.... with crop rotations that cater to what the previous crop-type(s) *didn't* take from the soil... and, thus, what would be the cheapest to add *to* the soil to cater to the next season's crop-type.

You'd be surprised how much can be grown on a very small area that way ... and with the proper rotation schedule, how long one can go before needing to add much to the land to keep it producing.

 In over a billion years, the only thing microorganisms have managed to evolve as a resistance to iodine is increased biofilm production   slower metabolic rates. Evolving a resistance to it is pretty unlikely if it hasn't happen by now 




 Ran across [this paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20675020) the other day... and a few others of similar nature... while doing some research on the use of iodine for footrot on cattle.

Basically, any 'excess' iodine in mammals is excreted through their fluids (saliva, sweat, semen, most-often urine ... but also milk). It's been long-used (or had been, the increase in antibiotics has decreased the use of iodine for livestock, unfortunately) with great success towards a *medley* of infections in the livestock industry. 

I'd imagine that the increased iodine in the milk would help to sterilize *many* pathogens that could find themselves in non-pasteurized milk.

...and, I, for one, am a pretty big fan of iodine... I'd imagine it'd go a very long way towards helping to cut back the use of antibiotics ... saving them for all but the most severe of cases ...  or, at least, more like with humans, instead of giving them by default as a daily additive, only when the animal is actually *sick*. 

It may help them to stay effective a bit longer, reduce antibiotics in groundwater, and, if nothing else, cut the cost of them to the farmers.  Iodine is generally *much* cheaper than antibiotics... and, not just healthier, but actually a necessary 'thing' for the health   well being of the animal... as well those that consume their products

 I'd think that there are much better things to do with the poo.

anaerobic digestion comes to mind ... sterilizing it then mixing it with land *not* intended for food purposes. etc

but, poo-char has always just seemed like a silly idea. I mean, on the one hand, great.. sterilizing any pathogens in the waste... and creating char .... but, on the other, poo just *doesn't* have the density that wood does.   same with chicken litter, etc.

It just seems... like a poor choice of resource utilization. There are lots of minerals and other in the poo... again, anaerobic digestion then a steam sterilization ... then utilization on non-food-intended lands.   just seems... smarter.

neat they're using solar to provide the heat though ... leaves more storable gases for energy production later on... like, during the night :) 




 x-post: /r/biochar

[original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/BioChar/comments/2xiwm1/major_water_saving_initiative/) 




 check out the link to the Rice U article at the bottom of the sidebar... it should help clarify things a bit.

But, higher temperatures generally *do* produce a higher quality char... stronger carbon-carbon bonds, higher porosity, greater activation, less VOCs, last longer, higher surface area (same as porosity but feel it should be worded that way too), etc.

There *is* a bit more crystalization in the bond-types, from my understanding...   as well, you'll (usually) get less char per volume of feedstock (there are 'tricks' around this but they're usually 'trade secrets' ... understandably so).

*at* the higher temperatures, more of the elements *not* bonding together will leave the system .... the heavier minerals tend to stay behind though.

The 'ash' from biochar serves well to mix *with* the biochar, imo... just to help add back *some* mineral content or value, but, really, it's not enough... *esp* with the higher porosity higher-temperature-produced biochar tends to have (feedstocks *do* alter porosity).

technically though, it *is* gasification *via* pyrolysis that *makes* biochar ... so, your question is misworded a bit.  Maybe more fast vs slow pyrolysis?  higher temperatures, of course, allowing for faster pyrolysis.

but, again, the Rice U article... pretty much the silver bullet to this 'debate' imo.  as well the evidence that has been shown again and again that until the VOCs break down (which lower-T chars have more of) ... they'll act as a *repellant* to the char ... and, it is, in fact, the 'explosive removal' of these VOCs *from* the char that *adds* to the increased porosity.

Higher-T's char needs loading all the more though... ...it isn't just because the higher porosity 'pulls in' and 'on' nutrients in the soil (kinda-sorta 'robbing' the soil from the *immediate*-availability of these nutrients) ... or that it pulls in *more* of these because of the higher porosity... but, the higher activation also means that it can pull them in faster, deeper, and hold onto them a bit stronger.

Really critical to preload the char first ... and, sometimes just blending with compost-alone isn't enough ... though it certainly helps.  I've found that adding additional additives (seems redundantly worded) are necessary ... SeaAgri, Azomite ... simply rock dust, bone meal, etc are great, imo.   ... as well lots of microbes.  don't *just* blend it with compost (and minerals/additives) but add microbes ... even if it's simply adding back compost tea brewed from the very compost the char's in... ... I've played around with adding molasses   sugar to char ... but, that was a pain in the ass ... though, the theory still stands: the sugars in the char ... *along* with the minerals... would attract the microbes from the compost tea *into* the char ... but, again, pain in the butt... even hot molasses (or warm) was just a sticky mess.

but, compost tea the hell out of the char *while* it's mixing with the compost ... it'll help to both 'load the char' as well drastically reduce the lag-time before planting once added to the soil.

but, looking at your question again ... it isn't *just* about temp, it's about speed as well .... *too* fast and there's more crystalization, too slow and the bond-types break down and much more of the carbon will simply evaporate. 




 /u/eosha /u/turtleislandcastaway 

might want to look into SumaGrow.  there are some great videos online that talk about the channels in soil that the organisms in their mix create *in* the soil ... as well the fact that they sequester carbon at about a 2:1 ratio that they sequester atmospheric nitrogen.  ....so, not *only* do they (both) help to increase soil N levels * * SOC-levels, but they *also* help to sequester the excess (fossil) nitrogen being put into the atmosphere from the pumping/mining of fossil fuel sources.

This, in turn, helps to build the soil and do so in such a way that it helps the soil to increase its holding capacity .... and, in a form (N2) that the plants most benefit from.

building [soil](/r/soil) is the main way this will be 'contained' ... it'll also help to sequester carbon, reduce the run off of *other* nutrients, and increase the bottom dollar to the farmer who utilizes it.

really a win-win all around. 




 and Bush will lose to Rand.  It's a shame really. I'd prefer to see her serve at least one term... *then* Rand do a double.  




 [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWqwSlZPcO4) may help offer ways to help said 'drought tolerant plants' be even *more* beneficial to the soil 




 A short video that may help
[Mycorrhizae Helps Reduce Nutrient Run Off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uukhM3-feQk)

now, this is a promo video put out by Mycorrhizal Applications, Inc ... but they are by *no* means the only company out there selling mycorrhizal products ... but the vid does a great quick job at showing the 'mechanisms' behind it 




 I think it's deeper than that. They're only the crusty surface. ....but, nuclear energy is essentially infinite (for all intents   purposes).... Doesn't play well for the artificial scarcity of fossil fuels when it comes to keeping fossil fuel prices up and limiting the industrialization of countries you otherwise want dependent on *your* industry 




 to continue this line of thought is a waste of both of our time 




 you got it! nail right on the head!

edit: ??? 




 they don't need to know me to be glad to see that I'm getting off a plane and (presumably) with money their area didn't have before I brought it with me :) 




  and the United States still doesnt know what to do with more than 60,000 tons of radioactive waste that has accumulated at its reactor sites. Then theres the issue of nuclear weapons proliferation and national security to worry about, not to mention the environmental toll of mining for uranium.

hate to just straight knee-jerk respond to the opening paragraph but... well, like the rest of the article pretty much indirectly points to: that 'waste'? its *only* '[waste](/r/waste)' because of politics!  It's still radioactive *because* it has harvestable energy! 

To have that stuff just sitting there *waiting* for an accident or theft to happen is .... is just sloppy freakin' politics!

To *not* .... to not *just* utilize it for energy.... but to *not* 'burn it up' to reduce the radioactivity of it, to reduce the threat of it... ... from both a threat level *and* an environmental-disaster-waiting-to-happen level is sloppier *still*!

There's *more* than enough energy (in, arguably, the 'waste' *alone*) to power *all* of humanity at levels advanced nations have grown accustomed to over the past century  .... for.... well, for longer than we've been an 'industrialized species' .... reprocess it in breeder reactors and we'd have all the more time to more-easily endure any dry up in available fossil fuels.

It's beyond ridiculous that this has gone on for anywhere *near* as long as it has. If I were apart of *any* 'nuclear movement' ... pro- anti- or otherwise, I'd be on this like white on rice.   ...instead it's apparently better to push solar   wind and bitch about carbon. 




 ... or nobody? 




 It's always nice to have some place to go...get away from it all 




 x-post: /r/BioChar  




  Why even bother posting this crap?

*for* the specific reasons I'd already stated elsewhere in the comments here over an hour before you posted this comment.   




 Not sure I'm entirely 'missing the point' .... just didn't choose to type out my entire thoughts   feelings towards it.

 This is dubious and reveals the bias right off the bat. I'd argue that we're healthier and have better food availability than ever before, but we can let this slide.

... well, I *did* state that I thought the article itself was 'bullshit' ... for what *that's* worth

 Sounds made up.

probably was. again, 'bullshit'

 name/number of the patent?

the op didn't, the one I liked to in the comment that you're applying to ... as well made a separate link to it... [did though](https://www.google.com/patents/US20040161440?dq=paul+stamets hl=en sa=X ei=8dLrVL2XLcOeggTOsISIDQ ved=0CE4Q6AEwBw)

 How exactly would an insecticide eliminate the need for round-up ready crops?

the very text you quoted above it says 'biopesticide' ... and, later, 'pesticides' ... ...nowhere in the text you quoted does it say 'insecticide'

 Cheap, maybe, but nothing is free.

of course not initially .... but, I know plenty of people who give away compost tea left   right after brewing huge patches of it. I'd see no reason these same types of people wouldn't be willing to give away spores and 'concoctions' containing these 'biopesticides' would feel any sort of conservativeness towards going the same with what's talked about.

I, for one, have 'compost tea brewed' SumaGrow's diazotrophs out with seemingly noticeable results. ... as it was the only thing I threw in the brew and it created something pretty similar looking to compost tea when I've brewed it, as well worked pretty effectively on the areas I used it.  ..albeit, not as well as the original product itself, but enough that I've done it more than 'a few times'.

so, of course not 'free' ... but, who knows what can be figured out from it down the line?   ...unless you're including the cost of the gas to get supplies and such into your calculations?

 pesticides aren't just for insects

Again, the author is arguably an idiot. .... and the article itself (arguably) 'bullshit'
but, when I read this article, pretty much the first thing that jumped to mind was [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krk2CoE2FPs) and, with it, the fact that it doesn't really seem like Tradd Cotter is referring to 'insectes' *either* when he's talking about 'personalized mycomedicine'  .... so, author may be an idiot, but I seriously doubt the sole thing the Stamets approach would address would *be* 'insects'  ..and, probably instead a host of other 'infections' that plague desired yields of the crops of focus.

Also, you're responding to my comment, not the op itself... and, in it I feel I decently-enough covered financial elements of the bullshit ... i mean, article

 effective fungal based insect deterrent sounds great

again! so much emphasis on 'insects' when the text you specifically quoted above not just used the word 'biopesticide' but also was completely lacking the word insecticide! don't get it!

 If there were an unbiased and factually accurate article about it I would do some more research on it. 

don't worry, I did it for you.  hence the link to the patent. Research away from there ... ..unless, of course, you think patents are junk too?

 This 'journalism' is

.... bullshit. again, I feel I covered this in the comment to which you reply. 

but, still a really 'neat' approach ... ...and, along a line of thinking that may either yield a biological approach ... or, a chemical one from the compounds produced via this route ... and, I really see no reason *both* routes can't be possibilities.   .... I'm no mycologist but from what little understanding I have (and from videos I've watched and articles I've read with or written-by Stamets himself ... as well other mycologists) , I see no reason it isn't a possibility? 




 [this site](http://naturalsociety.com/this-natural-food-could-finally-put-an-end-to-harmful-pesticides/) has it in an easier-to-read format... fwiw 




 [An easier to read format of the same article](http://naturalsociety.com/this-natural-food-could-finally-put-an-end-to-harmful-pesticides/) 




 yeah, won't surprise me in the least. 

I found it [here](http://naturalsociety.com/this-natural-food-could-finally-put-an-end-to-harmful-pesticides/) in an easier to read format. Think I'm going to delete this one and repost it. That other site's layout pissed me off while reading it. I almost didn't myself.  

I also think the article itself is kind of bullshit, personally .... but I really like the idea Stamets is working towards.  A *ton* of potential there ... ...and, it doesn't necessarily have to be an 'either/or' scenario either.

Also, the way the article ends... ...the 'knocks them off their fictitious monetary pedestals they believe to be sitting on' is a bullshit line.

they don't *believe* they're sitting on it, they very much so are... ...and, 'knock them off'?  Ha!  ... they're loaded. They have billions at their disposal. There is *nothing* to stop them from redirecting (some of) it from their current line of investments and *also* directing it towards *this* line of research as well .... and then patenting the hell out of as much of it as possible and burying anyone who comes close to challenging those patents under mounds of legal paperwork that even the best law firms in the world would have trouble wading through.  

That's the thing about money: the more of it you have, the more you can throw in various directions.

Not that this is necessarily an easily-patentable thing, if at all in certain approaches ... but, the 'filth of idealism' of certain aspects of this article are vomitous ... *at best*.  ...and downright bullshit in other aspects.

Either way, really cool line of research   thought Stamets   Co are doing. 'Infinite' potential there. 




  However, the sunlight needed for photosynthesis could not so easily be multiplied. Instead, the process would require artificial light, which means enormous amounts of energy  even if efficient LED lighting could be employed.  The question is where you would get that energy, he says

grow switchgrass for energy   biochar. the gasification of the switchgrass provides a syngas capable of either blending or straight-replacing n.gas.  thus, again, providing both the energy   the biochar to power the leds and densify the crop growth.

 cultured meat

If the words of [Allan Savory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI feature=youtu.be) are to be believed, removing livestock from the land is a *horrible* idea .... from an environmental perspective.   ....my taste buds probably wouldn't be fans either

 Dietary Changes
In general, meat has a higher environmental footprint than a vegetarian diet, says Winiwarter. It takes more area to produce feedstock for an animal than it would to produce vegetarian food for humans.

switch to (human consumption) insects for basic protein needs in blends for the less adventurous, and in excellently prepared dishes for those who like great food!

switch to insects as a feedstock for livestock. not a straight-replacement, but a supplementation. Insect farming takes up much less space and provides a helluva lot of nutrients for animals that seem to have [*no* problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSOdfSNxxKA) eating them.  (obviously do this on a much larger industrial scale would be required than this 'backyard approach' ... but there're *plenty* of unutilized [wastes](/r/waste) that [black soldier fly](/r/blacksoldierfly) could help turn into a valuable commodity for the businesses that produce it.  (the stockyards   butchers that process said livestock's probably a pretty great place to start).

 There is no silver bullet to resolve the environmental damage of agriculture, Winiwarter says. Instead, future innovations will need to be carefully monitored and evaluated for potential environmental effects, in order to minimize damage of nitrogen pollution and maintain livelihood on earth.

the sentiment of this part is b.s.   Agriculture can *solve* a lot of civilization's environmental problems ... if done properly.   ....and very much so on an industrial level that is both easier *and* more profitable for the farmer.

biochar production, water filtration, retention, soil building, carbon sequestration, .... [nitrogen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazotroph) [sequestration](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012407679200003X) via [biological fertilizers](http://www.sumagrow.com/) ... ....assuming that fossil fuels aren't going anywhere, and understanding that intermixed with a lot of the gas, petro, and even coal that's 'mined' is also the nitrogen that was in the biomass that *made* those hydrocarbons ... ...fossilized nitrogen (just like fossilized carbon) is coming up   out along with it .  fields of fast growth perennials like switchgrass fertilized with diazophic bacteria could help to not just pull that nitrogen out of the atmosphere (upon release), but do so while utilizing it as a fertilizer *for* the fast growth, energy-dense perennials that, in turn, provide a hydrocarbon source that helps to alleviate the dependence on said fossil fuels to begin with .... while providing biochar, habitats, (carbon sequestering) soil building, water filtration, water *retention*, and a cheap easy way for farmers to make a buck w/out having to destroy their land and work their asses off farming soil depreciating crops like corn, soy, etc.

Agriculture is a *solution* .... *not* a problem.   ....if done in ways that help make it so. 




 I have some friends that work (or have worked) for various refugee programs/non-profits ... great work. awesome programs. I really like that Louisville is so active in that area..    ....and there definitely seems to be a good deal of them, but I'd've been surprised if the number was at *seven percent*, let alone seventeen .... I wouldn't imagine refugees accounting for any more than 2% of that.

I'd like to find a statistical breakdown on zipcodes, ethnicities, sex, etc ... ...I'll try to remember to do a search for it when I get a chance.  ...just to satiate my personal curiosity.

It's unfortunate either way. I like the seed/garden idea. I ran across [this video](http://www.ripeandready.com/2015/02/gangsters-veggies-farmin-in-the-hood/) the other day ... ..it's kinda long and I'm not sure that it's *entirely* applicable to Louisville... I really don't think we're *that* 'hardcore' here but I couldn't stop thinking about a lot of the condemned homes in the west end ... ...or abandoned lots... benefiting from this.  ..really *any*where benefiting from this. I own a few vacant lots scattered all *over* town... southend, out bardstown rd, lyndon, etc .... I suppose I could start something on those instead of just watching it on the webtube.

thing is, you can't (easily) grow toilet paper... so I'm not sure it'd really reduce the number of people on the stamps.  ... just maybe help them have a better something to trade 'em in for (seeds). 




 Oh I didn't doubt the number, it just shocked me that it was so high.

Crazy that Jeff co. is that busy (period, let alone) compared to the rest of the state.  




 That 17% of the city is on food stamps is definitely a statistic I didn't imagine I'd read today.  ....even *seven* percent would've shocked me. 




 /r/Fluoride will prob have some pretty good info on it.

um, could search /r/conspiracy for 'fluoride' and I'm sure some results would pull up *there* as well.

um, could google: 'fluoride controversy', 'fluoride awareness', 'fluoride conspiracy'  

... then, to make it simple, there's always the ['Water fluoridation controversy'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation_controversy) wiki article.

but, the shortest way I can try to explain it is basically... the body needs fluoride, but only in trace quantities ... microgram quantities, and, very low ones at that. Fluoride is the lightest element in the halogen group, it chloride   bromide (elements the body *also* needs, but *only* in trace amounts) block the iodine/iodide that the body *really* needs vs those.   Iodine is needed (iodide is just a different 'form' of iodine) in *gram* quantities, not milligram, not low digit microgram, but double-digit gram quantities.  ...and it is not only super low in our diet, the RDA (recommended daily allowance) is 100-1000x below what it should be (150mcg ... vs the japanese, in contrast, consume upwards of 50mg and above a day.. every day. and also have just about the lowest rates of disease in the world.. .... from brain disorders to cancer to infectious organisms like viruses, bacteria, etc)

Even the ADA (american dental association) states that there's more than enough fluoride in our water for their purposes ... let alone our toothpaste... that any additional is toxic. We consume huge quantities of fluoride, daily. it's all but unavoidable, even if you're trying to avoid it (fluoride-free water, whole house fluoride filters, etc).

Many communities around the world (canada, europe, japan, etc) have looked at the evidence and voted to *remove* it from tap water ... and... well, they're fine. better than fine in many ways.

but, maybe the *best* way to explain it would be [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr2bSL5VQgM) 




 well, the 2% is what you do per weight of feed ... and I was more saying per 100# of body weight ... ...   two different 'things' for it to apply to

but, you're absolutely correct! 2% of 100# *is* 2lbs! :) 




 I've read about 1 tablespoon per 100lbs of weight .... would that be about the same as the 2% ratio you're getting? 




  Diatomaceous earth is silica dust, and can cause silicosis or lung cancer.

so *that's* why you mentioned the respiratory bit.

it seems almost *too* 'miraculously effective' *not* to use, from everything I've been reading.  Kind of makes me wonder why it's not used a lot more ... having only recently read about it. 




 I just ordered [some](http://www.amazon.com/Diatomaceous-Earth-Food-Grade-10/dp/B00025H2PY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1425267327 sr=8-1 keywords=diatomaceous+earth). I couldn't find any negative accounts with it ... and even the comments   such I *could* find weren't knocking it but more just saying it didn't meet the expectations they'd had ... but most of those even admitted that the bar was pretty high relative to all the positive things they'd read.

I might even try eating some myself ... it doesn't seem to do any harm and who knows *what* it'll drag out of me!  




 The video's where the *real* 'magic' is! 




 anyone have any experience using this? 




 *will* be ... this *will* be so cool :P 




 It also has a *lot* of fluoride. (yes, I'm one of 'those').

 this sounds pointlessly expensive.
 




 /r/Agriculture,
  
  I removed this post. I understand that this could look like some sort of malfeasance or even capitulation towards the (incorrect) statements that /u/JF_Queeny has presented concerning me. This post clearly has nothing to do with the focus of this sub/r and I felt that it not only detracts from the quality that we've all worked over the years to achieve here, but the reduction to name calling and slander is clearly against the T.O.S. of *most* of Reddit in general, as well a reduction to the most petty of behaviors.

  Thankfully throughout the years /r/Agriculture has (almost-) always managed to stay above lesser approaches such as this, and has, in my opinion, proven itself to be one of the highest quality social 'groups' across the *whole* of the internet. With subscribers and active users seemingly wanting to progress the field of agriculture, sharing ideas, expanding knowledge, and helping one another towards whatever goals we may have. 

  I apologize for not acting on this sooner, and I hope that the past 15+ hours that this post stood active before it came to my attention didn't detract from what has otherwise been (and, hopefully, will continue to be) a positive and progressive community.

  It is unfortunate that /u/JF_Queeny has both chosen this course of action, holds these beliefs, as well, has chosen to step down as an acting mod of /r/Agriculture. His contributions have been both beneficial *and* much appreciated throughout his short course here. ..and, as he stated, can be seen continuing over at /r/Farming.

   I, for one, am glad that there are *so* many gardening and agriculture subs on Reddit, each with their own thriving communities. I feel that each has their merits, points of focus, and hope to continue to see Reddit grow and prosper as a community.

  Again, apologies for any detraction or discomfort anyone may feel towards this situation and the already public information it has brought forth, and hope that /r/Agriculture can continue to move forward as the beneficial community I feel it to be.

Sincerely,

  According to studies cited by Seneff, glyphosate engages gut bacteria in a process known as the shikimate pathway. This enables the chemical to interfere with the biochemistry of bacteria in our GI tract, resulting in the depletion of essential amino acids .

Monsanto has maintained that glyphosate is safe for human consumption, as humans do not have the shikimate pathway. Bacteria, however, doesincluding the flora that constitutes gut bacteria.

anyone have any links to the studies 'Seneff' cited?

 yeah, that's what I figured ... it was more just a quirky way to word it 




  SRIs process uses plasma arcs to facilitate reactions between molecules of hydrogen and titanium chloride, a chemical produced from titanium ore. Arcs, like lightning bolts, crack the hydrogen, producing atomic hydrogen that can readily react, says Barbara Heydorn, senior director of the Energy Center at SRI. The reactions produce titanium vapor that quickly solidifies and forms titanium powder.

anyone care to explain what 'atomic hydrogen' is? isn't all hydrogen atomic? even when it's a part of a molecule it's still... an atom... right?

 it's an electric leaf blower. the process takes 3m a day tops. I'm not super concerned about how much power it's using.

whether he wins or not... well... depends on the dem-ticket (I'm more a libertarian.... which, by default, leans me pretty Rand-heavy) ... but, I'm not only *pro* a Ky rep as prez, but also not a big fan of the Bush's ...  ....stale. as. fuck.   .... obvious. as. fuck.  (as to their agenda)

I'd much prefer the 'Paul' agenda (with a history or *returning* funds to the state... posterity or not, it's still a point well made, imo... than a(*nother*) Bush push for a(*nother*) war in the middle east.

but it's of a doctor, just a few years out of medschool, does all the boards, everything.. is a fully licensed, fully insured practicing MD doctor.  Two or three years out (probably early to mid 30's) has aggressively   competitively worked his way up through the hospital to a high paying position...   ..through dedication, discipline, and having no life outside of work   the hospital, has managed to live in a nice but 'quaint-enough' apartment... and paid off *all* of his school loans and such... and even saved away a nice savings.

A few more years... say, '33-35' at this point, and with mounting stress over the frustrations at what he sees as hospital   insurance policy towards less-than-effective treatments towards diseases, becomes ever-increasingly frustrated at the entire medical community and one day just 'snaps'.   Goes home, packs up his minimalist apartment into boxes. Arranges for it to all be moved to storage by the same life-long friend who suggests he take a break and go to an island and drink rum, get drunk, get laid, relax, maybe learn to sail and for god's sake get a tan.... ...at that, Dr 35 jumps on the first plane, flies to some small beautiful but somewhat trendy tropical island in the Caribbean. Meets a girl, takes him to *her* home island... a remote paradise, completely separate from the tourist world... where he learns to sail from her bad ass uncle... while also becoming friends with the local indigenous population... .... when having outgrown his situation and feeling ready to go elsewhere (just like his now-girlfriend/wifey-type outgrew the island and went elsewhere to work)  they make a pact to sail around and take it easy.... 

....then, very '[Hot Pursuit](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093215/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_68)'-like pirates, kidnapping, rescuing, sharks, stingray pets, maybe a jellyfish bite... and, again, pirates... he rescues her and they sail off into the sunset together... turning their backs on the modern medical world, while going from place to place helping the local indigenous populations with practices picked up along the way...  

but, the crazy badass uncle? he teaches the doc how to sail in exchange for the doc healing him of scurvy ... someone somewhere has to have scurvy and be two sheets to the wind-crazy like Robert Loggia's 'Mac' MacClaren character *in* 'Hot Pursuit' .... ... why someone living on a tropical paradise with fresh fruits you could reach up and pluck off the tree and eat immediately anywhere on the island would have scurvy?  I have no idea.. ...maybe a lot at sea or captive situation ... but, the point is... scurvy   a pirate are in there.

 I think the most effective approach to this would be to run a campaign showing how smart pigs are.

If pigs can be presented in such a way that both their intelligence *and* their personalities can be put in front of the public eye on a regular basis... the idea of eating these brilliant creatures (that are also the single largest tapeworm carrier in the average person's diet) would hopefully become as detestable as eating dogs or cats.

Showing pigs as pets is probably an excellent way to start this... if, say, xyz character from Friends or Two and a half men had a (smart, cute, personable) pet pig? If pigs are put out there as *pets* vs livestock... the public may turn against it.

Granted, pigs can go from smart to stupid... and back again... *repeatedly*... ...depending on how they're raised but... that's just another one of the amazing things about these creatures.

 One more thing: Dont buy TransCanadas argument that crude-by-rail disasters demonstrate the need for the Keystone XL pipeline. In fact, the two transport methods have very little to do with each other.

 The vast majority of crude moving by rail in North America is moving east or west from the Bakken shale or other shale sources, says Swift. Thats not the tar sands crude that Keystone XL would have shipped south from Alberta. Keystone XL wouldnt take crude off the rails.

 Depending on the size of the order... but it may make sense to just go directly to the manufacturer.

Either way, you'll want to narrow down the specific seed-products that you want, then from there it shouldn't be *too* difficult.

Location is also a big one... as, again, volume coming into play here, shipping can be a major cost of any large purchase endeavor (or small for that matter!). 

Once you've narrowed down the handful of seed-types that you want, having 2-3 manufacturers of each time should give you something to negotiate off of... and then just contact the manufacturer ... or go to their website and search around until you find local (or local-enough) distributors .. then contact them directly.

again, having a few gives you something to play them off of each other with

  Again, peer reviewed literature would be useful here to support any assertion

[It's technically illegal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_modification#1977_UN_Environmental_Modification_Convention), I highly doubt information like that would be made readily available to the public.

As is, [this (pdf)](http://csat.au.af.mil/2025/volume3/vol3ch15.pdf) is about the best I can provide .. and, since its been about 10 years since I've read it... my memory is *more* than a bit hazy on it.   but, from a military/defense perspective, it makes a *lot* of sense to research the hell out of it ... to at least know what enemies are potentially capable of ... let alone the ability to use it ourselves. I also would imagine that any organization that *is* researching it would want to keep something *that* advanced as quiet as possible .... fore, as the History Channel show you point out is *not* evidence clearly states, the plausible deniability of it *is* what would make it *so* effective. 

...then, professionals such as yourself coming in saying such things are unimaginable adds all the more credit towards a coverup as possible. 

(you should probably check the show out... lightening, cloud seeding, etc is covered in it). 




 I doubt it'll have a problem moving forward. RO tech is advancing pretty quickly... and new [materials](/r/materials) are being worked on that are excellent at filtering water... ....[graphene](/r/graphene) can filter water to ['perfect' purity](http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2014/feb/17/graphene-oxide-makes-perfect-sieve) ... and it's looking like this stuff will be printed like newspapers ... just as fast, just as large a rolls... if not larger.

I read about graphene pretty much daily, I can't really figure out the hangup on why it isn't more available yet... but, the point is... water purification from a materials standpoint is making great strides. From an energy standpoint ... well, obviously that's limited, but with solar being printed like newspaper rolls as well, or at least capable of it... I doubt energy will be that big of a problem moving forward.

Point is, from *that* perspective, there should be plenty of water... affordable water at that.

But, what gets me is the inclusion of Tim Flannery in the article, but the *lack* of mention of [biochar](/r/biochar) in the article. I was under the impression that Australia (in general... though, more NSW specifically) was one of the most progressive places in the *world* actively utilizing   incorporating biochar into the soils.  I'm really surprised that that hasn't carried west and been more of a 'hit' in Perth... ....it'd definitely go a long way towards both building soils as well limiting water requirements for the area.

(Tim Flannery is *well* aware the [potential of biochar](http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2008/s2611906.htm) .. (search: 'char' ... he calls it 'charcoal' but same difference, it's introduced in the interview *as* 'biochar') 




 There are other documentaries related to weather manipulation.

In those documentaries there are scientists that *also* 'study these sorts of things for a living' ... and, in their cases, *specifically* study the systems   approaches being utilized. As such, many of their testimonies or accounts would beg to differ.

I read a lot of medical-related things. One of the things I come across quite often is where a general doctor (be it M.D., PhD, or just someone labeled as 'doctor' in a generic sense from Newark's College of Medicine   Taxi Driving') that will completely contradict what other MD's, PhD's and just hardened researchers will specifically focus on. Talk to the researchers, you quickly realize that they have a rich understanding about the topic being discussed, talk to the 'general doctor' and ask them the same questions and they either respond with the more 'general line of thought'... aka, the 'popular opinion' or 'what they were taught' ... or simply don't respond at all.

The contradiction is what's funny to me. 

I ultimately don't have a clue what's going on... I've read many places that the energy equivalent of even a simple jetstream is orders of magnitude higher on a daily/hourly/minutely/consistent basis than all the nuclear weapons we've ever created.   At the same time, influencing, manipulating, or slightly adjusting something requires a lot less energy than containing it altogether ... ...and, as such, can still have a cumulative toll down the line.

Anyone who's ever stuck their hand out the window of even a slower moving car and 'ridden the wind' can attest to the idea that a slight move of the hand, bringing resistance to the wind, can drastically alter the placement of your hand, wrist, arm, and focus very quickly afterwards.

Maybe 'slight adjustments' are all that are needed to make a system bring on dramatically different results?

Unless your focus is specifically on systems of this nature... and, by 'systems' I mean ionospheric heaters and technologies of that sort... not to dismiss your experience   expertise but... in the relatively-random environment of reddit ...where 'streed cred' is a bit harder to verify, [links](http://weatherwarfare.worldatwar.info/2013/11/can-facilities-like-haarp-be-used-to-manipulate-the-weather/) help provide support to statements, claims, and positions. 




 It's from 2008 I believe. ... so the tech has advanced considerably since then from my understanding.

At that, 2008 was well into the transition from what the HC used to be to what H has since become ... ....but, 'That's Impossible' is one of the last (and, arguably, *best*) good series of the 'old HC' that used to (relatively) rock.

It's a good show. I make it a point to watch every time the weather gets a little wacky ... ...like, beyond normal 'it's cold because its winter' wacky.   ...just as a sort of refresher/reminder that things within the realms of being controlled, but still beyond my control are going on.

  Some temporary fixes can be made but before long the plants will have to be decommissioned.

hopefully sooner than later. Not saying another Chernobyl-like event is really a concern I lose sleep over with them... ...I'd *imagine* they're pretty heavily monitored at this point, as well, relative safety precautions have been put in place drastically limiting the likelihood of a repeat incident. 

...at the same time, the overall design itself just seems... ...'Yugo-quality'.

 Ultimately? no. not really.

but, then again? yes. absolutely.

do i think you'd really learn any new 'data'? no. and, anything like that is better learned in a book or online or something ... ...what individual or collective teacher/s can dump an encyclopedia of information... period. ... let alone in a singular season?

it's impossible... ...and, ultimately, unnecessary to look at it that way. 

what *would* be learned is... ....there's a big difference between *reading* about holes being dug... or, more, things going in them .. ..and, getting out and digging holes.

it's the 'hands-on' experience of it.   ... the 'immersion' of sort of it.

the rest? read some (more) books! :)

i think the idea though is that you'd be able to get your hands dirty with it for a bit. I'm sure there may be better ways to do it than a PDC ... maybe other 'groups' available around where you live .. ..but, PDCs are just the first that come to mind, of course. 




 I think you pretty much hit most of the problems right on their head...

those that have the money/resources don't know, and those that know don't have the money/resources. ... or don't care. ... nor do they really *have* to, unfortunately.

Going to bullet point 1... I'd imagine that it'd prob be better to work for someone else for a bit than try it on your own. Maybe get some experience with people   places that're already doing it .. ..then branching out from there?  ... vs trying to tackle it on your own right from the start. That sounds like a surefire way to find yourself stuck in a really troublesome and demoralizing situation ... really fast.

maybe work with some of the permacultural groups or do a PDC this summer or something? 




 Sounds like an awesome non-profit! ... and you definitely seem to have great ideas towards it...

The point of my snarkiness is... you'd be better using a [Kill-a-Watt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_A_Watt) to get a measurement on your power usage ... I'd average it out over something like 30 days.  

Just plug the same devices you plan on having in your cabin into a power strip that is, in turn, plugged into the Kill-a-watt and take your measurements at regular intervals to get an idea of your average usage.

From *there* you can start to design your system.

But, as others have said here... well, two things 1) H.Freight makes crap quality ... ...and I *really* wouldn't want it coming down to a h.freight--quality product. Not that you can't always swap it out with a higher quality one once you get the money or narrow things down ... ..you'll obv be saving a *lot* living off grid like that ... ... but, some things are worth spending a little more up front on.

2) batteries. Solar panels are awesome, but they're only as good as the batteries storing their juice.

You'd be best getting a system that allows for *multiple* inputs ... that way if you add more panels, wind, etc... you can plug them in... but still comes back to the batteries being charged.

Also, a generator. Obviously you won't want to use it often... it kind of defeats your purpose ... but, you can (most likely) find a great quality generator on c.list ... something that runs both 120 *and* 240v is my recommendation ... you never know when you'll want to weld or power something a 120v alone isn't going to be able to ... I have both, and they're both heavy... at that, I find myself throwing my 240v into my truck more often than my 120 just 'cause... well, they're both heavy ... ..and, being stuck out w/ just the 120v and unexpectedly needing the extra power, the longer run, or the higher voltage just isn't worth the trek back when throwing the 240v in in the first place would've done it.

240v's also tend to have more power than 120's alone... though I've seen plenty of just-120's with way more power output than some 240v's i've seen.

either way, the point is, a generator is a great thing to have... and the ability to have both it *and* solar charging your cells at the same time is going to be all the nicer. ...albeit, costlier too.

a nice inverter run directly off the battery/alternator is nice to have too... ..again, power distance becomes an issue .. ...if your cabin is in the woods, far from where you park .. ...but, I can power my [13 amp chainsaw](http://www.lowes.com/pd_36_0__?productId=3009620) off of my truck alone... as well my 120v generator ... and make quick work of branches, small trees, and brush w/out having to pull out my Stihl. 

...which leads me to... ....you can also get into [pyrolytic](/r/pyrolysis) [gasification](/r/gasification) of [biomass](/r/biomass) whereby you feed the [syngas](/r/syngas) into your generator and... well... being a cabin, you'll have plenty of branches or brush I'd imagine ... ....and you can just use *that* to charge your batteries for a peaceful night's sleep.

but, as great as H.Freight stuff is... I'd really opt for some higher quality products .. ...esp if its going to be your sole system that you're dependent on  .... w/*out* other back up sources of energy

I know this is /r/android much, if forced to choose, I'd take the Acer Aspire Switch any day of the week and twice on Sunday.   ...but, both have their strengths   weaknesses ... mainly the OS. Android is just better as a 'tablet-tablet' than Metro is... but, then, I never use the Switch as a Metro-type tablet .. and though the versatility of Windows 8.1 allows android to run inside of it isn't something I've messed with, it allows for it... which may account for something if I ever got around to trying it out on it

 Wood chips are fantastic! 

While driving down the road, just grab the number off the side of a truck (or google their business name if their number isn't there) that you see loaded down with wood chips. I've never met a single one who *won't* deliver for free when they're in the area.

Where I live, they're required to dump in yard debris dumps (at a fee) or have to drive out to surrounding counties (traffic, time, energy, distance, etc) to dump on someone's farm... ...so they're almost *always* glad to deliver for you.  .... though they don't like to drive off the driveway (understandably) so if they dump them on your driveway, lay down a tarp or two  (the more layers of tarp, the less likely it is to tear when dragging it... Harbor Freight has coupons for free tarps *all* the time... and I've never had a problem with tearing when I triple-layered up)

um... but, yeah, awesome stuff!

The crews around here will usually use two different teeth-types for their chippers.... ... one that does chips, and one that does shreds.  

The shreds breakdown a *lot* faster... have a *lot* more 'green' (aka: nitrogen) in them, and are better for composting with.

The chips (usually hockey puck or fist sized) are from the trunk and larger branches... *excellent* sources of carbon... .... but they take longer to breakdown.

If you can build enough of a relationship with a grew... or just pay them (they'd be getting *paid* for something they usually have to *pay* to dump so... $10-20 is usually more than enough) ... they'll separate the loads for you... ...esp if you're close enough to the job they're working on.

At that, the chips make excellent mulch for walkways and such... ...but you'll need to add a *lot* of green to them to get them to breakdown in a timely manner. 

You can spray them with compost teas, that definitely seems to help... if you brew any, just spray any excess over the piles .... works great for speeding up [composting](/r/composting) anyway..

...or, if they've separated them for you, or dumped them at separate times... just be sure to mix a higher ratio of shreds to chips ... so the nitrogen will aid the breakdown.

If you're feeling *really* adventurous... but a bottle of SumaGrow (shelf stable for I believe 5 years.. so a gallon will last you for multiple seasons) ... and use a little bit to breed it out (compost tea-style) and spray them with it... .... add in some extra sugar (or molasses) to the water at the last minute so they'll have something to eat once the get on the woodchips (literally just using warm water (not tap! has chlorine!) and mixing organic sugar into it in a separate sprayer works... and apply before/after/during)... ... either way, the diazatrophs in the SumaGrow will breed out, fixing nitrogen, and helping to accelerate the breakdown all the faster.

Awesome stuff... tons of nutrients... and multiple purposes.   excellent source of carbon.

on the black walnut? ... [juglone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juglone) is the chemical they're looking for... ... diluted down it isn't a huge problem... but maybe use the black walnut to make [biochar](/r/biochar) out of instead?

 Not sure which it is.

I've definitely had moments of waiting (too many tabs open, so it's my fault...I know better) where I've thought about removing the chip that's there and soldering on a 4gb one in its place. :)

edit: I'd typed $250 in my first post... I actually paid $225  (I hunted   waited that bitch down like a fucking pro for it to drop below $250 refurb'd.... free s h too!)     [NewEgg's now selling it for $200](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834314777 cm_re=acer_aspire_switch-_-34-314-777-_-Product)

...which puts it in price with the OP's price-paid.  being said... .. I'd buy the thing again   again.

Of course I have a few 'things' I'd prefer be different about it, but for $225?? or $200?  ...I like it a *lot* better than the Asus equivalent (which I was looking at beforehand ... and my laptop is an Asus ... as well my Android tablet.. and most of the components of both of my desktops)

it's better than the Asus in formfactor though... and price... and battery life..     the screen flips... i mean, its detachable but you can reattach it 'backwards' and fold it down so that the screen faces up... in the same direction as the keyboard .... ...well, like the pic in the link above.  or just use it detached from the keyboard altogether.


My 'complaints' about it ... .... I really really like windows 8.1.  Of course I tweak the everliving shit out of it... mainly using Classic Shell ... and have it set up so that I never *have* to use Metro... and rarely do even by choice.   ... unless really really bored and don't have wifi so I'm kinda just killing time.

The 'complaints' 

1) the ram ... 4gb would just be much awesomer ... the ability to upgrade to 4gb would be totally sufficient... esp for the price. it doesn't have to come with 4gb... but to have it configured in such a way that it could be increased...

2) if the USB port were 3.0 in such that I could use a usb key to increase the ram-ability of it. I've never done that whole use a usb-key as ram before but I've heard/read good things and... would possibly suffice *not* having 4gb of ram

3) the screen's capacitive touch is really really nice. I really have no complaints... .... again, I use it in desktop mode, not metro... so any quarks are probably relative to that but... there's something about how it reacts that's different than, say, my Asus tablet or HTC M8/LG G3 phone's screen.  but, again, probably a windows thing and possibly something that windows 10 will improve upon.  ....not an issue one way or the other, more just a 'quark'

4) I'd *really* like if the keyboard base had the ability to put a battery in it.  As is, the keyboard is totally *not* necessary for function... charging, etc. I oftentimes use a full sized keyboard with it ... if i'm sitting at a desk ... despite that the keyboard is surprisingly nice... esp for one so small.

but, if the keyboard has the ability to slide in an extra battery... as well, that extra battery to charge the device... as well, be able to *be* charged independent of the device ... in such that I could keep it charging ... carry the screen around... and then plug the screen-keyboard together to charge the screen... as well to give juice to the screen... both, at the same time. ...that'd be nice. I'd pay extra for that.

I feel like there's another thing that I'm forgetting but... *that* I'm forgetting it means that it's not only not really a big problem... but is an even *smaller* problem than the already mentioned small problems above.

the ram is the main issue.  and it isn't even an issue, I just have to remember to keep my tabs at around 10 or less.   ...and I use OneTab for chrome so that makes it pretty easy ... as well as the 'get pocket' extension ... so, moving tabs from various computers/devices ... as well collapsing open tabs into a onetab tab if it gets slow is only a problem if I have something I'm working on in an open tab... say a reddit comment that *won't* back up... and then I just need to move that tab around so that it doesn't collapse into the OneTab consolidation.

With that... for $200? fuck yeah. If it had android it'd be all the cooler... but, only in a dual-boot configuration. ..

...oh! the speakers!  It has *better* speakers than my LG G3 (paltry) but *not* as good (nor as loud) as my HTC M8 ... ...that's second to the ram. They're not bad, they're just quiet   it has bluetooth 4.0 though so that and/or just normal headphones let me get past it but it'd be nice if they'd increased the volume on that a bit.

apologies for the full review of it. just really a big fan of the thing.. esp now that it's $200 




 I bought a refurb'd Acer Switch 10 for $250 off of newegg about six months ago... I haven't had a problem, and for a tabletop convertible deal, I love it.

Would buy another in a heartbeat ...and without a second thought if anything happened to it.

It's only real limitation is the 2gb of ram. 4gb's would've been nicer, or at least the ability to swap the 2gb chip out for a 4.

It isn't android...but I like that it has Windows on it. If I could dual-boot I'd set it up, but I imagine I'd rarely use the android boot just because it's a full version of Windows (i detest metro and never use it).

 Not a fix but it's an awesome extension either way: OneTab 




  Ok, you're backpedaling.

no, not really. again 'it just depends on preexisting conditions'

 ...often cut by 50%"

but not always, again, preexisting conditions.  as well, rate of application of char, porosity of char, etc.

 Then in this last comment you admit that gross overapplication of water is....

saying that 'this variable *too* comes into play' isn't as much an 'admission' as a statement going along with the 'preexisting conditions' statement above. but, spin it however you need to I suppose.

 If water was being overapplied previously, then the biochar cannot be credited with the reduction in water usage.

and why not? why can't it be a reduction in overapplied water *combined* with the increased water holding capacity of the soil relative to the increase *in* water holding capacity of the soil afforded by the application of biochar?

That'd be like shooting someone twice, each time in a vital organ where that single shot would've killed them and then saying 'oh, that second shot to the liver did nothing because it was this shot in the lungs that actually did the killing' ... both are contributing variables. both play a roll in the reduction.

Now, possibly a more appropriate analogy to fit with *your* statement would be two shots, one to the heart, one to the head. both lethal in   of themselves ... but, most likely the shot to the head would lead to the death quicker... (granted, even *that's* relative to where in the head the bullet goes) ... but, even then, to say that the bullet to the heart would still not have an impact is just to completely ignore the presence of it to begin with.

backing out of the asininity of that analogy, the point is: you're essentially completely ignoring *any* effect biochar would have. ...and, by it's mere presence, it'd have at least *some*. ...even if it was a negative one, it's still there, thus, still having an effect.

...and, again, evidence implies the biochar as well would improve retention.

 I'm not disputing that biochar or some other soil amendment is capable of increasing the water holding capacity of a soil.

yes. yes you are actually. not just in the above paragraph but with this quote

  not a product any soil amendments.

and your complete dismissal via the comparison of biochar to a Nigerian prince. 

so, yeah, actually, you were. feel free to 'backpedal' some more if you need to though.

 What i am disputing is the numbers. 

and, again, the numbers will be entirely relative to a multitude of variables and, again, preexisting conditions. ...amount of prior water use included.

 Even if it increased the soil's water holding capacity by 25%

wow, it almost reads like you're beginning to open your mind to the *possibility* that it *may* have at least *some* effect on the soil! hope you didn't strain yourself too much with that one! I know those rusty doors can be a bitch to open sometimes.

 We're not gonna see any significant reduction in water usage from just that.

um... what?? if it increases the soil's water holding capacity by 25%, then by default 25% more water would be capable of being held. If the water is applied, then 25% less water would need to *be* applied to meet similar results.   as such, there'd be the capability for a 25% reduction in water use and, as such, a savings of 25% relative to water-cost.  I don't know what numbers you're holding 25% relative to, but where California (again, the point of focus of the op) has ~5% water use for residential purposes.. and they're putting pressure   restrictions *on* residential use... I'd say that even a *few* % is considered worthy of upsetting their constituents, let alone *twenty-five* percent!

but, 'significant' is a relative word open to subjective interpretation so... 

 I can't find much data on turfgrass water loss from irrigation

[here's a link](https://extension.umass.edu/turf/fact-sheets/turf-irrigation-and-water-conservation) you may be able to discern some data from  ... if so, you obviously didn't look too hard because that took well less than 2 minutes to find.

at.. well, basically the rest of everything you typed in your next paragraph....

the losses due to evaporation are oftentimes due to the fact that the water simply can't get into the soil to begin with. It literally doesn't have the porosity needed *to* flow down. Work with enough clay soils and you'll quickly realize that soil aeration is the difference between swimming in mud and actually watering a plant.

At that... to go back to the link I just sent... iti gave a nice chart relating to sand, sandy loam, loam, etc.

Since you seem to need links provided for you vs being capable of finding them yourself.... try [this one](http://www.journal-ijeee.com/content/4/1/44)

Note from that

preexisting condition: loamy sand soil

biochar type: yellow pine pyrolyzed at 400C (50C *below* the temperature stated in the [Rice U study](http://news.rice.edu/2012/03/22/cooking-better-biochar-study-improves-recipe-for-soil-additive-2/) I recommended checking out in a previous response... 

ala this line: The researchers found charcoal produced at temperatures of 450 Celsius or higher was most likely to improve soil drainage and make more water available to plants, while charcoal produced at lower temperatures could sometimes repel water. - See more at: http://news.rice.edu/2012/03/22/cooking-better-biochar-study-improves-recipe-for-soil-additive-2/#sthash.64FMvdk5.dpuf

)

read: it's a lower quality char produced at sub-optimal levels, lower porosity, and, otherwise *not* the quality of material a company like Cool Planet would provide (if memory serves, their temperatures are in the ~1000-1500F range, but I'm not spending the time to dig that up)

application rate: 9% mixture of biochar

closing line of the abstract: "Results show a doubling in water holding capacity by mass using a 9% mixture of biochar (equivalent to 195 metric ton/ha), which is an agriculturally relevant concentration. High percentage mixtures of biochar increase water holding capacity dramatically. These results suggest the use of biochar has potential to mitigate drought and increase crop yields in loamy sand soil."

...and that's a sandy loam where the water can even get into it to begin with... take clay soils that're heavily salted and compacted as fuck in such that they essentially act like 'plates' where water just 'rushes off them' ...barely ever getting beneath surface levels?  may be able to increase that even *beyond* the doubling.

throw on the increased porosity of char attained from the 450C+ temperatures recommended by the Rice U study? as well increases in ratio above 9%... possibly and quite-probably even higher than that..

from the conclusion: "Water holding capacity of unamended sandy loam soil, 16%, is doubled by the addition of 9% by mass of biochar. This finding is important because it establishes biochar as an effective medium for increasing irrigation effectiveness, runoff mitigation, and reducing non-point source agricultural pollution."

also: "This study only considered one type of biochar (yellow pine from pyrolysis at 400C) mixed with one type of soil (loamy sand), and thus further research is clearly indicated."

that goes along with the sentiment behind the statement I was making that it's still needing to be researched, but preliminary results are positive ...

and, lastly, the entire closing paragraph of the conclusion

 To promote the practice of agricultural biochar soil amendment, the full life cycle costs and benefits to biochar soil amendment must be estimated. The effect of water holding capacity on crop growth due to water holding capacity, nutrient retention, and microbial growth must be understood, in addition to the benefits of the likely reduced need for irrigation and fertilizer and pesticide usage. Inclusion of traditionally externalized costs associated with carbon and environmental degradation, a side effect of current farming techniques, will further improve the cost/benefit analysis of agricultural biochar usage.


the savings aren't *just* from water reduction... ... nutrient retention, fertilizer, pesticide usage... these are expensive amendments (that, according to your logic, do nothing to change the water holding capacity).  that biochar *seems* to only increase SOC and microbial activity within the soil, thus helping to increase the microchannels in the soil provided by these organisms over time... the results down the line may prove to show an even *greater* increase in water retention.


 In order to get to 50% water savings from the soil amendment, it would need to increase the soil holding capacity by 250%, which is absurd.

only using your numbers it would.
 




 because, fuck gravity 




  Ok, fine, i hate to be that guy

then don't be

 but for once i'm gonna ask YOU to show me the numbers.

I have. multiple times. again, /r/biochar. I've posted *thousands* of posts there, personally. There's *more* than enough there to support both *your* stance *and* *mine*.

To go through it to pick out a few just for you... only for you to then dismiss them by (probably not taking to time to...) picking out a few more that show *negative* results is, quite simply, a waste of *both* of our time.

There are a lot of different qualities of char produced from difference source materials and processed/'created' in different ways.  ....and each showing their own results. 

and, this isn't just relative to the reduction of watering by 50%, but growth, input reduction, etc. it's across the board. 

It's a 'new' material that's still in the process of being figured out. 

As I've stated up to this point, it's largely relative to 'pre-existing conditions'.   ...if those conditions are last year's compost? it's probably not going to show a lot of improvement. If it's dry desert 'soil' that's about as dead as this 'conversation' is? it'll probably show a lot more improvement vs it *not* being added.

again, i'll let the studies dealing with preexisting conditions of which there are *many* posted in /r/biochar (by me, ..and others)  provide that data. 

 I imagine if you took a situation where terrible amounts of water were wasted and implemented a comprehensive water saving plan you might be able to save 50%

that *too* has been covered in a few of the studies. but, again, /r/biochar. there are a *lot* of published studies out there relative to biochar, and many of them linked to *via* /r/biochar.

  However, that savings would be as a result of gross overapplication of water previously, 

this variable *too* comes into play

  not a product any soil amendments.

inevitably/of course?  but to say that 'no' soil amendment is capable of helping to increase the holding capacity *of* said soil? is to, again, ignore evidence to the contrary posted elsewhere... be it in /r/agronomy, /r/soil, *or* /r/biochar.

..and that isn't *just* limited to biochar as being an amendment capable of increasing soil water retention. 




  Frankly i get tired of sparring with you over issues you post in this sub

apologies, but I don't remember 'sparring with you' before the exchanges on this post.. ...but, then, my memory's not too good. for all i know, we've 'exchange blows' many times before this one.

 You basically assert here that i'm an ignorant luddite incapable of understanding useful technology.

in this instance? (again, excuse me if there've been previous ones that escape me right now) ...in a *way*? yeah. unfortunately, you've offered nothing other than 'magical' 'dismissives'. You've not addressed the original (very short!) post other than to say that biochar *doesn't* save water. 

There are *many* sites that cover biochar.. I'll give you that a lot of them are 'fluff', but there've been more than enough that're based on peer reviewed published science/journal papers/entries as well.  .... papers that *have* 'researched' it in accordance to (and above   beyond) the standards set forth *for* published papers. There have been plenty of papers showing a *lack* of positive results as well as papers showing where it increased yields, met or exceeded initial theories   hypotheses. It's still early in the science of this 'material'. Even the IBI and biochar communities have pushed back much of the 'path-forward' goals to 2020   beyond. Papers like the one Rice U put out in March 2013 have done much to help 'raise the bar' on the standards needed to produce a 'quality' material, but even then, it's still a more-generic term for activated carbon... whereby the carbon is sourced from a biological material. 

Is there a 'snake oil' element to it? absolutely. but is there science behind it? absolutely, as well. but that you'd dismiss it as being the 'agronomic equivalent of a Nigerian prince'? well, that clearly implies that you have little to back up your perception of it ...beyond just rattling off your (equally b.s.) perception of it. 

I've suggested /r/biochar in the comments on this post *more* than enough times at this point to imply that maybe it's a sub people might be interested in checking out. $17.5k (plus s h, time   energy, etc) isn't a small chunk of change (in market value) that, though Cool Planet's intentions may be as much PR-focused as anything else... but, well, let's see how it does. Chicago's incorporation of it into their city parks has shown positive results, as have other cities. City of Thousand Oaks may *also* show positive results... ...or, hell, it may show *negative* ones as well. ...only future postings relating to it will provide evidence to either. 

but, your 'tone' is... bah. finger-vomit as far as I'm concerned. be it the first post we've exchanged according to it or the up-teenth. 'Frankly', it's still useless fodder filled with nothing of relevance or note. 




 it'd be nice if the press would cover this aspect of it more as well.

sad about the almonds. those things take a while to grow!

cotton in California just seems like a horrible waste of resources to begin with. best to keep that shit in the southeast where it belongs!   ...or, at least in environments better *naturally* suited for its growing demands.  no tears shed over that one.  but the almond trees... and other orchards... that one sucks! 

maybe they can team up with nestle to get some of their water 




 technically the heating of wood in an oxygen free environment. 

the 'burning' comes as part of the next step... ie, once the gases separating from the carbon ignite and, thus, burn.

so, more correctly worded would be: biochar is created by the pyrolysis of wood.   

but, essentially, yeah :) 




 explain this 'magic'

who claims? what do they claim? I've read where char made from bullshit doesn't work as well as char made from denser woody materials. though, maybe you could provide a link?

what's that Clark quote? "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic'
so, basically, the ignorant are incapable of understanding the science and, thus, conclude it must be magic. 
Does the fact that you're so dismissive of it mean that you're incapable of understanding the science behind it? or just ignorant *of* it? 




 did *any*thing that I wrote above even remotely mention what you responded with?

What I said was pretty clear. if you check out /r/biochar or just google: 'biochar' in general and look at many of the results, you'll see that the addition to biochar to soils, combined with biochar's porosity's ability to hold onto water that water use is often cut by 50%... if not more as a result of biochar's application/addition to the soil.  ...granted, the preexisting conditions of the soil will determine how much of an improved holding capacity it will bring, it still seems to bring *some* regardless.

found [this](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/08/22/159391553/how-a-biofuel-dream-called-jatropha-came-crashing-down) while searching for it. haven't had a chance to read it yet though


edit: I read it... and a few more.

honestly, I'm not convinced of it. for a short-chain hydrocarbon switchgrass and miscanthus make more sense.  and, imo, switchgrass makes more than miscanthus. I just like it better, despite it not having as high of a hydrogen density, it makes biochar, provides more pulp (for paper, particle wood, etc), is hardier than miscanthus, and grows as far north as southern canada... as well, its the native grass to that these other biofuel crop-types replaced.

but, jatropha wasn't for short chain hydrocarbons... it was the oil in the seeds.  and its drought resistance (switchgrass is a major soil builder, absorbs tons of water, is is very drought resistant itself... again, it's the native grass of the midwest).

but, well, ... i'll give it that it's prob better than soy in many ways? (no clue on the energy density per acre... vs soy... and i don't like soy. period. let alone for an energy crop). .... but, i like algenol's process better. and it makes both short *and* long-chain hydrocarbons.

9000+ gallons per acre of ethanol *and* ~1'500 gallons of longer-chain hydrocarbons, from gasoline to diesel.
as well 'pure hydrogen' as a processing byproduct of it. 




 maybe it's time we start using the grass *as* the biofuel crop?

 It would definitely seem to've made more sense to put something in effect towards the agricultural industry; restrictions, caps, penalties/fines, programs to increase water retention, recycling, decreased water use, equipment implementation, changes in agricultural practices, etc ... ...vs 'punishing' the residential sector which pales in comparison for water use vs the ag industry.

Golf courses I can understand, but they're some sort of 'hybrid' between ag   residential use..... 'sod farmers' essentially, with sport played atop. but... then, golf courses are registered, and doing something whereby the water companies have an extra-special water-tap-type for golf courses would make sense... and, then, restrict or at least regulate from there.

but, to 'punish' residential users who account for 5% of water use is stupid... esp while 'ignoring' agriculture that accounts for 80%.

It's intention is, imo, to make the masses 'think'... which only undermines the political base's constituents while at the same time lining their pockets with ag   industry funds before they're voted out of office 




  Lawns and golf courses take biggest hit in the state's first-ever mandatory statewide water reductions. Farmers, who use 80 percent of the water, are exempt

the complete system, including photosynthesis to provide the biomass, becomes a net

 well, if you have abundant woodland, that's a totally different story.

Get some cinder blocks. build something like [this](http://cdnpix.com/show/imgs/b44d4b854621cd417ce62f77a23f2c09.jpg)... no need to do it two-blocks-tall. one should suffice (half the price).  Then just increase the length as you can afford to. 

You'll need to cover it with insulation to keep the worms   moisture in and to keep the rodents out.  you'll need to line it on the bottom with metal screen... again, to keep the worms in, moisture can drain (if need be) and the rodents   burrowers out.

You should be able to get into it for $100. worms included. Prob half that if you do it right.  If no money for *that*, you have bigger problems than composting you should be worrying about.  ...but, to not point out the obvious and offer advice instead... get some pallets. check craigslist or put up a post for some.

take 'em apart, build a box out of 'em, and just start piling the waste up until you *can* spare the $100 to build a vermiculture bed.

Once you get to that and you get stuck, shoot me a message, I can walk you through how to both scale up (that part's simple, you just make it longer) ... as well how to go vertical.  

ideally you'll raise the bed off the ground, something like [this](http://cdn3.volusion.com/qdozm.zuend/v/vspfiles/photos/V182-20-2.jpg?1393678219) ... but where the cinder blocks you've already purchased are the sides, 1x1's, 2x4's whatever are the legs   'rails' .... and you'd still use the same wire screen you already purchased for the underside... and line the area underneath with some free tarps from H.Freight. or $1 or $3 or whatever they are for the smaller ones with the coupon. 

that way it's 1) elevated for burrowing creatures 2) elevated so it's easier to work with 3) you can scrape the castings off the screen underneath 4) still length-scalable. E) using   incorporating the materials you've already purchased into the elevated design.

 you're forgetting to incorporate the ancillary variables ... but, I agree, 2 gallons is about max. 2.5 maybe. but, 5 is pushing it 




 no, the reason there's a 'water crisis' is because 90% of water is used for agriculture ... and, is used in a horribly inefficient way towards horribly inefficient crop-types. 

*then* throw on nuclear, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric or whatever other 'renewable' form of energy you want to in order to desal water and.... the problem is that much *more* 'solved' 




 1.5 gallons a minute if the sink's on full blast and kept running. 

throw in the energy methods to pump the water, heat it (if using hot water), transport various things dedicated to keeping that water pumping, purified, etc.... sure, why not?  even a 1 minute brushing could easily be over 2 gallons. 5 seems like a bit of a stretch, but then again, some utilities are more efficient than others?? 




 I wrote 90% of a response to this. then i got a phone call. then, sometime during the call and the subsequent errand it required, my computer restarted.. losing the response. It was too long to attempt it again.

 I got into a [similar discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/Soil/comments/30j39w/remineralize_soil_to_grow_nutrient_dense_crops/cptw0k0?context=10000) Friday   yesterday over at /r/soil.

If the nutrients aren't there, they can't be mined. At the same time, if you're putting down a cover crop to help 'keep things there', other than [fixing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazotroph) [nitrogen](http://www.sumagrow.com), there's not a whole lot else they're going to do... *possibly* feed [PSBs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate_solubilizing_bacteria) and a few other organisms to help 'free up' and 'make more bioavailable' other nutrients already in the soil.

Gotta add 'em back in.  Be it via compost ... or, better, compost mixed with trace minerals. 

As stated in the /r/soil discussion, I'm a personal fan of Azomite   Sea Agri, Inc's mineral 'blends'. 

Azomite, *itself*, is 'mined'.... so there's of course some degree of limit to the quantity of nutrients that that process will be able to provide. ....albeit, a pretty far-out one from my understanding. It's a pretty big deposit of trace minerals.

SeaAgri, Inc, on the other hand, uses 'waste' minerals 'filtered' as a byproduct from desal plants in the Carolinas.  ... clearly there's no limitation to nutrients in the oceans ... and with desalination only likely to become [more](http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2014/feb/17/graphene-oxide-makes-perfect-sieve) [advanced](/r/graphene), cheaper, and more widespread in the future.... this certainly should provide *more* than enough nutrients for adding to the soil.

Get into better [waste](/r/waste) management practices... from storm water run off to sanitation waste, etc ... filtering then recycling nutrients for reapplication to the soils from wherest they came... ...well, all the more.

The thing that 'bugs' me about the 'we're running out of x,y,z' (water, nutrients, fertilizers, etc) is the idea that these things are, for the most part, elemental.  None of them 'go away', they just become less-easily accessible.

But, in the case of the 'kind of elements', Nitrogen, we're adding *more* of this to the atmosphere than existed in it before... ....fossil fuel mining, drilling, whatever moves fossilized N from inaccessible stores into the atmosphere. Diatotrophicly loaded biological fertilizers can go a long way towards fixing much of this nitrogen back into the soil, and in the N2 form that's readily bioavailable to the plants ... and, along with it, the anaerobic forms of the strains fix the C from the CO2 they pull into the soil as well.  SumaGrow had a conference-video a few years back whereby they reported something like a 60:40 ration of C:N fixed by their diatotrophs. ... whereby in lab conditions (kind of a key phrase there), the C   N they were fed, they fixed 2 parts carbon to every 1 part of Nitrogen they pulled in from the readily available atmosphere they were provided.  ...thus, not just bringing nitrogen into the soil, not just doing so in the readily available N2-form, but also fixing even *more* carbon into the soil...  not only changing the pH very little, but building   providing SOC to the medium.... plants, fungi, microbes, 'other soil biota', etc.

Water is just a matter of holding onto it better. Of course there are larger variables at play... directions of jetstreams (El Nino/La Nina), aquifer availability, etc ... but, other than freshwater running off into the oceans, it hasn't necessarily 'gone anywhere', it just needs to be brought back into freshwater form and made available again ... ala SeaAgri's desal plants. 

Phosphorus is the one that'll prove to be the biggest problem moving forward as the trace quantities of this available as desal byproduct is much too low to produce what farms are currently used to, and with mines running lower every year... it will most likely present the [largest problem](http://www.one-tab.com/page/jzkrdGNXRx-no0O-vk2giA), but, again, with proper waste management   reintegration... as well moving to crop-types and growing environments that either require less phosphorus to begin with, or recapture it more efficiently for cycling back into the system... this should be less of a problem than feared (hopefully?) ... as well, many even say it's a myth to begin with.

Point is, I suppose, proper management combined with a progressive mindset that's embracing progressive approaches *should* make much of the resources scarcity feared as much of a non-issue as it needs to be. ...but, that won't stop the panicists from finding something to fear-pander about to justify their writing salaries.

 definitely seems to be a growing trend that's likely to continue well into the foreseeable future.. unfortunately 




 the entire roof opens up. *plenty* of venting capabilities there 




  the perceived benefits often have less to do with added nutrients, and have more to do with changes in the structural properties of the soil.

definitely. I mean, if the structure of the soil doesn't allow for (easier) access to the nutrients within it then those nutrients may as well not be there.   ...within limits of course.

then again, to say that life is pretty well evolved at getting to the things it needs may be an understatement.

but, the nutrients still need to be there to begin with if they're *to* be accessed to begin with. 

 sometimes it takes structural changes in the soil to enable the plant roots and associated microbiota to mine the deeper layers for water and nutrients.

and a *need* to mine the deeper layers. if the nutrients are all at the top, there's not a whole lot of incentive for the plants *to* root deeper.   That's kind of what I was saying before, one of the problems with making nutrients so readily accessible in the top soil is that plants simply don't need to go deeper to get to them.  I've both read *and* experienced this myself. 

but, working nutrients into the top soil ...and then letting them naturally work their way down into deeper layers through 'more natural forces'... is a lot easier than working the nutrients into the deeper layers by hand/machine. 

It's soil. 'nothing' tends to happen with it very quickly.

 Obama ended funding in 2011. It's geologically unstable.

was known to be *before* the thing even started to begin with.

The salt mines in the gulf area are *much* more geologically sound.

Been around for something like 100 million years and are estimated to be geologically stable for another 250 million.

salt 'heals' itself when put under pressure.  the more pressure (ie, the more heat), the more it heals itself.  That's why the strategic petroleum reserve is there.

Really have *no* idea why *this* wasn't the first place thought of when scouting locations for what eventually became Yucca.

... i mean, there's a *reason* the SPR is there... the stuff could take a direct impact from a multi-megaton nuke attached to a bunker buster and the salt would simply 'heal itself' from the heat from the whole thing.   dig back through it and, viola, you're connected with your petroleum (or nuclear waste in this case).

and, by 'healing' what I mean is that they crystals of the salt line up and create a air/water tight seal.  and, since the walls would be so thick, there'd be 'countless' salt crystals *to* act as the walls.

there's obviously a lot more chemistry   physics behind it than that paltry explanation but... the point is: the *more* you f' with it, the *safer* and *more* sealed off it all gets.  ...and, again, will stay that way for 250 million+ years... or, about 249,590,000 years longer than the *longest*-lived nuclear 'waste' would stay radioactive.


....now, getting it there would be another issue altogether. 




 I like [Azomite](http://www.azomite.com) personally. [SeaAgri](http://www.seaagri.com) too.   ... though I have some soils that are a good mix of both and they seem to perform the best as well.

but you're exactly right on the 'rocks to suckers', 'sound like snake oil salesmen' and shipping costs! that stuff certainly isn't cheap! 

I've actually talked to the ceo of SeaAgri for a few hours ... a few times actually. He's a really cool guy. In the case of him, there was nothing 'snake oily' about 'im.  I've talked with Azomite too, for bulk ordering larger quantities directly... they're a little 'colder' on the phone, but their approach is more.... ....'corporate-structured' I think than Sea Agri.

There are NDAs involved with both so there's a little bit of discretion needed in how I word this but...  well... 'most products' tend to be a *lot* cheaper when you buy in bulk directly from the source vs going through 'countless'-party (3rd party) retailers. 

but, yeah, the mix of the two seems to be the best from both 'the numbers' as well actual performance.

Actually, and this makes perfect sense if I felt like typing it all out (which I don't and you probably already know) .. but, the plants actually tend to grow *smaller* in nutrient/mineral-rich soils... as well the individual crop *from* the plant (fruit, veggie, etc).... ....*but*, the turn around seems a lot faster and the overall *yield* is usually a lot larger...

obviously there's a varying reason for this (crop-type, soil conditions, etc) ... but, take tomatoes for example: the size of each tomato *isn't* usually this gigantic 'softball' but more like tennis balls, maybe even a bit *smaller* in fact... but, they're heavier and the plants tend to grow a *lot of 'em*!

pick a few and the next round seem to blow up really quickly!

I'm assuming that as the stuff gets rained down into deeper   deeper layers of the soil, the plants will need to grow deeper   wider roots to extract the less-dense nutrients/minerals and, as such, that should 'alter' things a bit.


but, one way or another, minerals are great but it's the biota that *really* breaks 'em down and make 'em bioavailable.  ... but, well, again, can't break down something *to* make it bioavailable if it isn't there in the first place

   but it only stops shockwaves (one of the few things Star Trek and other science fiction shields don't seem to stop)

awesome! so this is tech that's even *more* advanced than Star Trek!  




 the link didn't work but I agree with you ... that's why I'd like to see it based on an acreage level.

meaning: not how the 'quantity of registered farms' adds up, but how the farmed acreage of the country does....  of *course* there's going to be more-*smaller* farms than bigger ones... 

but I'd imagine that if it was looked at the other way, though the acreage would likely be divided up amongst multiple individual businesses ... that the vast majority of the farmed land in the US *wouldn't* be family owned farms.  

'meaningless' is really just the tip of the iceberg on a study like this.  




 Nutrients can only be made bioavailable my soil microbes if the nutrients are in the soil to begin with.

It's really a multi-pronged approach that's needed: 1) add minerals 2) add microbes to make those minerals bioavailable

but, soil can have all the microbes in the world added to it left   right but w/out the minerals being there to begin with, there won't *be* anything *to* make 'bioavailable'.

 Companies like Cool Planets, Waste to Energy Solutions, Soil Reef, Black Owl Biochar, etc provide biochar at industrial quantities. 

'large home *any*things' are probably not the best way to provide industrial scales of 'things'. 

but, I've set fire to HUGE piles of 'waste' biomass .... and, with the help of the local fire department, we were able to control the fire to produce a huge quantity of biochar from it.

It certainly isn't the most efficient process for converting waste materials to biochar but... the fire department was *more* than glad to offer their services. When I called to notify them our intentions about a week before... to make sure everything we were planning met code and to ensure that what we were about to spend a half day setting up (moving around biomass) was within county codes (it was) ... the fire marshall all *but* 'begged' to be there for it. 

when I explained the intention was to not *just* reduce the waste biomass (as is often done in that county... open fires) but also to attempt to maximize the production of biochar (and sending him a few articles on what biochar was) he was pumped! said his 'men' would benefit from practicing a controlled burn like that.

that it was even *more* challenging to *control* a burn than it was to simply put a fire out... *esp* where the intention was to make a specific product... and maximize it at that.

The entire department came out and participated and had firehoses coming in from *multiple* directions.  The pile itself was ~50ft across and at *least* 25ft tall (in a cone/pyramid shape).

I'd guess we got about 30% biochar by volume from that. 

Haven't gotten around to make more from it, though the pile of waste biomass building up should *easily* double that.

the code reads: 100ft of a structure or major treeline.   

when I called to make sure, saying we were wanting to do about 10 ~10ftx10ftx~8ft piles around an acre or so, but more than a few hundred feet away from anything of note... the fire marshall said (and I repeat verbatim): 'you could cover an entire *acre* under 10ft of bursh and light it on fire... as *long* as it's a minimum of 100ft from a major treeline or structure.'

again, by no means the most efficient way to do it, but considering we were just going to burn the waste anyway?  (we'd been given the heads up that we needed to do something with the pile of barely-composting material... as our 'composting excuse' wasn't holding up any more...) 

long story short: we had a LOT of biochar and covered a pretty substantial-sized field with it ... that's also the low point of the area and where the *majority* of the fields drained to.

the field? it went from potentially the *least* productive and *most* hassle-filled one to the *most* productive and *least* problematic one.  ...albeit, it took a bit for the char to 'age'.


there's more than one way to skin a cat :) 




 biochar certainly isn't *free*! have you checked prices lately??

  Its payback

Unfortunately, it's very likely that that be the case. This is definitely an example of trite, petty disrespect... by *both* countries.

The US, under Obama, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Reagan, Carter, Ford, even Nixon or LBJ before them should have come public about this *much* sooner. *Clearly* the Likud party and US presidential relations have a long history with one another...  and, one another not necessarily seeing eye-to-eye as to how each of their leaders should address the other's (relative) 'congressional bodies'. 

It's most unfortunate the circumstances by which this information came to be declassified... but it should have been declassified *much* earlier. Possibly even *before* the '87 date *this* specific report was put together.

 and he had his feelings hurt by Bibi

possibly. Obama's feelings aren't something I've ever cared to pay too much attention to, nor been all that concerned about either way.

But, 'Bibi' should have been more respectful and should have gone through more traditional and 'politically acceptable' paths. Just as Obama should if he chooses to speak directly to Israel's parliament.

...as well, just like he should have before 'playing his part' in the declassification of this report.  Hopefully both parties can be more respectful during future 'revelations'   'declassifications'. ...but, I, personally, would prefer to see continued declassifications *regardless* of 'who's feelings are hurt' by it.

 and the Jews must pay

this is just a stupid statement. and I'm only acknowledging it *to* disregard it *as* stupidity, bigotry, and unnecessary. 

 Fucks sake, the Admin said there would be consequences if Bibi accepted...

yes, they did. and note should have been taken. Regardless, this report, and the many others like it that I'd imagine exist, are *long* overdue coming public.

Again, the circumstances are petty, but at least the information is *finally* becoming public after *decades* since its creation.

 They tried to sway the election in Israel

I'd imagine that *most* countries attempt to influence the elections of foreign governments in which they're heavily invested. the US to Israel, US to UK, ...US to Venezuela, Japan to China, even Israel to the US.  Assuming they *don't* is naive at best.

 and now they are releasing State secrets.

State secrets that are *decades* overdue being released.  again, only the timing   form of it is unfortunate.

 That's what I like in a leader... Petty, butthurt, reactionary decisions

to each their own.  I would have much prefered that *both* countries took a proactive approach towards making this information public a *long* time ago.

like Gandhi said: 'Non-violence, which is the quality of the hear, cannot come by an appeal to the brain.'

or, in this case, 'Obama's butthurt   pettiness'.   But, again, however it came about, this information is decades overdue entering the public's eye. 




 I'll add to that even...

Though I'm commending the US for *finally.* ***beginning*** to become more public about this, I'm also *condemning* ***them*** for having taken so long to do so. as well... for doing so under current political situations.

The US, itself, has been *long* overdue in becoming public about its *own* involvement in the situation.

*Clearly* the US has *over* a half-century history of deploying *its* nuclear armaments *all* over the world. ..and signing agreements with those countries in which it's done so.

For strategic purposes, many of these have been understandably kept secret... but, as such, it has *not* been kept secret that 1) the US does so nor 2) the obvious fact that the US is a nuclear armed state.

I'm not condoning *or* condemning Israel's nuclear weapons programs, nor am I saying that Israel *shouldn't* have nuclear weapons (nor that Israel *should* either) ... I'm maintaining the posture that the global community has a 'right' to know which countries do possess them.   ...or, at least, that a country possessing them has an obligation, a duty, a sense of 'personal' obligation in making the global community aware that they do.

....after a 'given' period of time of course. ...but, 30 years is *more* than enough time for that, let alone 50+.

There are 'things'... 'subjects' if you will where 'ambiguity' and 'omission' is understood, but *not* in the case of WMDs, and *certainly* not after a period of decades.

Israel sits at the table of the global community, and holds the global community to the rules of that table, it's only 'fair' that they hold themselves up to those standards as well.  ....again, *esp* where it concerns WMDs, and ***especially*** where those WMDs are nuclear weapons. 




  Are you seriously commending them for having signed a treaty that they are breaking.

I'm commending them for having signed a treaty. I'm *not*, however commending them for breaking it. ....*but*, at *least* they've signed it and, thus, there's a point of reference to hold them accountable for their actions, and to hold them accountable for in relation *to* what they've agreed with.

Separately.....

 while condemning Israel for staying honest, but not completely forthcoming?

Yes. I am condemning Israel for not being completely forthcoming.

It would be one thing if this were still, say, 1965 when the Eshkol-Corner memorandum was signed by the US   Israel. That was 50 years ago. An entire half-century. 
Kind of a lot has happened in regional   global politics since then. Regardless, it's *still* **more** than enough time for Israel to have taken steps on its *own* to go public about it. It (clearly) hasn't. Regardless, there are three sides to that coin, with only *one* of them being Israel. The other (largest) side being the US. and the flat edge in between them being an unspoken obligation to the global community. 

As such, Israel hasn't come public, but, the US (finally) has. Now, for whatever reasons... be it the '80's and under the [Republican-Reagan administration](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/Backchannels/2015/0303/Echoes-of-Obama-Netanyahu-tussle-in-Reagan-Begin-showdown-of-1981) or 2015 under the Democrat-Obama administration... or the 'medley' of dual-party administrations in between them, (as stated in OP, the 386-page declassified report was 'published' in 1987, like Obama, in the second-to-last year of the dual-term Reagan administration.   That was nearly 30 years ago. 

At this point, I think it's been *more* than enough time... since even *that* report was first published, let *alone* since nearly 25 years prior... that not *just* the US   Israeli people's be made aware of US-Israeli nuclear cooperation, but the global community at large .... *esp* with what's going on with Iran.

Israel's *not* having been forthcoming, after 3-5 *decades* is, at this point, a bit beyond 'staying honest' to their policy of 'nuclear ambiguity'.

*Esp* when Iran *has* come public about *its* nuclear programs. ...and, not just public, but has signed the NPT *over* a decade ago.   ....regardless of whether they're abiding to it or not, that is a separate issue... one to which they can be held accountable *by* their having signed the treaty.

Do you really think that 'not forthcoming' and 'ambiguity' are respectful   responsible policies when it concerns nuclear weapons in ai hot bed part of the world riddled not just with multiple wars (during that time) but also attacks specific *to* nuclear facilities within said region?   

More so, what I am *absolutely* condemning is the *hypocrisy* Israel has shown, and, I'll really let the mass-bulk of Israel off the hook and more specifically single out the Likud party ...and, even more so, Netanyahu specifically... for having been so loudly vocal   public about their/his push towards Iran's possible 'shadiness' over its nuclear program.... while maintaining a position of complete ambiguity over the nuclear weapons that he, himself, has the capability of deploying.

It's ridiculous. ...and, instead of maintaining a posture and running drills over invading a foreign country, bombing its facilities, and doing so in a non-globally respectful fashion... that's as 'rogue' (if no more so) than Iran advancing its nuclear technologies, sciences, and capabilities. ...*esp* when there's very clearly   very publicly already a global effort in effect *towards* coming to a solution to this ...'situation'.

as best I can say it, Israel should put its grievances forth in a more respectful and traditional fashion than stepping out of line... ....or else find themselves under the *same* scrutiny that they are way-to-vocally advocating that Iran be put through. 

If they were *equally* as vocal about N.Korea? India? Pakistan?  all who have developed, tested, and most likely *deployed* nuclear weapons, that'd be one thing... but, no. and, as such, the very selfishness that has been shown towards their singling out of Iran is no different than the myopic idiocy that Iran has shown towards singling out Israel.   As a member of the 'global community', I'm of the opinion that Israel's *lack* of objectivity, combined with their methods   approaches up to this point, should mean that, at this point (five *decades* after purportedly having attained/developed nuclear weapons), they be held up to, or '*subjected' to* the same standards that they feel *other* members of the global community have been.. ..esp where those members have at *least* been public about the existence of a program ...and, as such, have not only agreed to, but *have* signed a treaty showing their acknowledgement of this... over a decade ago. 




  Must be a coincidence

no, probably not *just* one, but the information being declassified was *still* long overdue. as is a lot more information I'm sure.

regardless of whether or not it was in response to this, there are still multiple parties involved, not *just* the president.

 




 This was long overdue.

This was also released back in Feb...*before* Netanyahu spoke to congress.

The declassification process involves a few more people than *just*the president 




  Those are "only" nuclear capable aircraft.

Oh, it's clearly 'for show' ... but, what's that line from that movie: 'you don't put on a condom unless you're ready to use it'  - 'Gary Busey' character, I *think*  (Under Seige??) 

If I were flying around nuclear-capable aircraft, I'd prob throw on a nuke or two just in *case* someone got the wrong idea and decided to start a war over it... ....but, then, the entire thing is a spectacle. Who really knows how 'real' any of this is. 

 I would argue Obama's habit of blowing people up with unmanned drones also makes the Nobel prize a pretty big joke

yeah, dude's definitely drone-happy. ...or was. but, then, if I had an army of drones at my disposal, I'd fly the hell out of 'em too.  ...though, I'd probably back off on the 'blowing people up' bit. not really my idea of a great way to spend a Thursday afternoon. to each their own though, I suppose? 




 Just got behind on the news/emails

I'm working my way towards catching up with the more soil-focused stuff :)

  Iran can sign whatever the fuck it wants

but they signed it, right?

 it doesn't change the fact that Iran is still a religious dictatorship

technically it's theocratic republic.

and, in my opinion, religion and government should be as separate as possible. that goes for secular democracies as well.
Religious symbols shouldn't be on 'state' flags. period. but, again, just an opinion.

 who have repeatedly called for Israel's destruction

yeah, their idiots. I'm not defending them. I'm simply stating that they've at least signed the NPT while also holding the position that they *don't* have nuclear weapons. *You* are saying that Israel has been a nuclear armed state for 40+ years... isn't that plenty of time for them to step up voluntarily and sign the NPT? 

 and make threats almost on a weekly basis

India   Pakistan do their cute little ceremonial [border closing ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC9NeJh1NhI) every night ... ...without fail apparently. (quoting the opening line of the link).  India   Pakistan are also two of the four not recognized as nuclear weapons states according to the NPT. N.Korea   Israel being the other two. And all *three* of them have publicly recognized their nuclear weapons programs ... if by no other means than having (publicly) tested their nuclear.  Sure nuclear testing is a detestable practice, and one that Israel *hasn't* (publicly) done, but, well, as you state, they have nukes, and have had them for 4+ decades. I'd imagine somewhere during that time there was some testing done?

at that, congrats, Israel is on a list with Pakistan, India, and N.Korea when it comes to their nuclear programs. Iran? again, public about their program. ... at least purportedly while also under investigation.

the point of the 'threats' is that a hostile and defensive posture is maintained by *various* states around the world. idiotically so too, imo.

I'm not condoning Iranian actions towards spewing   spreading hate. The US has various people of power, from even our own former VP calling for bombing Iran, as well a former presidential candidate well known for his 'bomb bomb bomb Iran' dity.   There's a difference between 'preparedness' and hate spewing.  but, just because some idiots are spewing hate doesn't change the fact that Israel shouldn't sign the NPT and become more public about its nuclear programs.

 It has always been an open secret(Obligatory dumbspeak: EVERYONE KNOWS)

what? that Israel has maintained an irresponsible posture and civil disservice of *not* being public about their nuclear weapons? as a citizen, I would certainly want to know if my government has weapons of mass destruction. It drastically alters the response-type that hostiles may take.

 it seems you don't actually understand the implications of the US publicly admitting this and how it affects their foreign policy?

first, *who's* foreign policy? Israel? The US? Both?   No, I have a pretty good understanding of it actually. I've thought and read about it for a few decades now. ... hence why I'm glad that the US has finally taken the responsible step of declassifying the documents and making them public.   but, at that, just incase I'm missing something, why don't you fill me on on what *you* think the implications of this are... again, just in case the feebleness of my mind in which you imply is, again, missing something or incapable of pondering the possibilities.

 Iran's Ayatollah also said 'Death to America' a mere two weeks ago.

ha! yeah! that was funny! he's been doing that for a while now. so have his predecessors. Always brings a nice kneeslap when I hear/read them doing that.  I'd like to see Iran attack the US openly. Their defense systems and potential nuclear/weapons capabilities *pale* in comparison to much larger countries that the US has gone eye-to-eye with in the past, present, and probably the future.  Saber rattling is what it is. but, again, this changes absolutely *nothing* in terms of Israel not being public about its nuclear programs.

 Oh, and let's not forget Iran's longstanding history of denying access to inspectors in their facilities(BUT HEY, peaceful purposes!).

and they've been sanctioned over this and the necessary steps have been taken by *various* governments in accordance with this.

'peaceful purposes' or not, again, Iran's nuclear programs have *nothing* to do with Israel *not* having been public about theirs. Still not getting it.

 People like you make me doubt just how sane people are in other countries

I've traveled the world. many times, many countries. spanning decades. and having returned to many of the countries I've traveled to and seen development   growth (in both directions... good *and* 'bad') in the average sentiment of their peoples. There are both sane and 'crazy' people all over. 

 you're essentially giving a loaded gun to a sociopath and expecting him to use it to herd cattle.

no, that'd most likely've been the US officials in the mid-'60's that gave that 'loaded gun' to someone... in the case of LBJ's admin purportedly giving Israel a nuke , or at least the US gov't helping Israel develop one of its own.

as far as 'giving a loaded gun to a sociopath'... if it was Iran you were referring to as the sociopath, and the US giving them a nuke? no. no. they seem to be developing that tech on their own quite well.  albeit, Ike did help them along.   but, at that, what is this 'loaded gun'? Iran and a nuke? or the US declassifying this document? Is this document the 'loaded gun'?  If it is, I *hope* it spurs things along towards a nuclear-free world.

 You mean the Osirak attack which has been universally praised by the western world 

yes, the Osirak attack was what I was referring to. granted, I didn't condone *or* condemn it, I just stated 'that israel attacked iraq' .... and positioned itself to attack Iran in much the same way. 

again, I didn't condone *or* condemn it. I was just stating that they had. preemptive strikes aren't exactly acts of peace, are they?

granted, you're right, they showed the self control to not nuke them... but, then, that'd mean going public about their nuclear programs, wouldn't it? 




 they've been flying (purportedly) nuclear armed aircraft all over the place of late... 

for example, [just yesterday](http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/swedish-military-reports-russian-aircraft-baltic-sea-29864492) it was announced activity over the Baltic. they buzzed N.America off the coast of Alaska a month or so ago... Britain last month? two?  the Crimea, etc.

meaning: sure there may've been *some* disarmament ... but the arsenals are still very well stocked and, as of late anyway, been actively deployed. 

it's by no means limited the threat of nuclear war, and was almost entirely a 'cover' for Obama's embarrassing act of prematurely accepting the Nobel *before* having even done it.

The 'classier' and 'more respectful' thing to've done would've been, if nothing else, to have politely put acceptance on hold until at *least* the deal with Russia was made ... and, even then I highly doubt it was what the Nobel community was thinking when they first offered it (way too over-enthusiastically and prematurely at that).  The Nobel community was as much at fault as Obama, more so even imo. But, that Obama accepted it more than clearly showed his ego's inflatedness.... again, imo.  




 ...after the fact, and I seriously don't think it was on the scale the Nobel was originally intended

Also, Russia's nuclear activity of late would imply that it did very little towards the way of a more-complete disarmament 




 I didn't say it had. 

What I *did* say was that at least Iran has signed the NPT... while *also* maintaining the position that it *doesn't* have nuclear weapons.

By your statement, you imply that Israel not only *does* have nuclear weapons, but has had them for *40 plus years*.

You don't think that a government that has nuclear weapons has an obligation to let both its peoples *and* the world know that it has them? ...and not just 'has them' but has *had* them? ... for 40+ years?

on your sentiments of my going to /r/worldnews... why not both? 

This is big news, in my opinion. and hopefully news that spurs a change in not just Israeli nuclear policy, but nuclear policy all over the world. *Clearly* the world is long overdue coming together to reorganize the way it approaches nuclear armaments. I, for one, am of the opinion that nuclear weapons need not exist  in the control of individual countries... if at all. 

The serve as an excellent deterrent, yes. but so do lots of other weapons systems. They've only (publicly) actively been used in warfare twice, with catastrophic effects ...and, despite [#8's](http://www.cracked.com/photoplasty_507_20-mind-blowing-then-vs.-now-comparisons_p2) exemplification of the resiliance of humanity, no one should have to endure such acts again. 

Iran at least states that its refinement of nuclear materials are for the peaceful purposes they   Ike had agreed they would be used for... but, if this report is true (and I have no reason to think that it isn't), Israel has been refining nuclear material for both energy *and* weapons purposes. 

That Israel has attacked Iraq, done test runs and attempts to attack Iran, as well maintained a very public policy of holding Iran up to standards that Israel's government itself doesn't feel that it should have to is hypocrisy of the *most* dangerous nature.  




 About. Damn. Time.

Israel's hypocrisy on its nuclear programs is decades overdue in revalation.

Israel's political establishment has attacked Iran for not holding up to its requirements as set out by Iran's signing of the NPT while Israel *itself* hasn't even signed it despite 'countless' speculation over the past decades of Israel having nuclear weapons of its own...


What's good for the goose is good for the gander.

Now if only this can lead to ALL countries condemning and dismantling their nuclear armaments....like that which Obama won (*and* *accepted*) a Nobel for nearly a decade ago and has *yet* to do anything about.

No Nukes! Atoms For Peace!  




 I'm going out on a limb by assuming that you *didn't* watch the video? 




 highly doubt this will go anywhere anytime soon given the fact that oil prices are set to stay low until the next war 




 I'm sure the sails can be retracted and the masts lowered. 

The problem I've read about going back to sails *isn't* the ports, it's the room taken up on the deck. Personally I see this as being something relatively negligible but apparently it isn't relative to the energy savings.

Those [kite powered cargo ship companies](http://www.gizmag.com/cargill-ship-will-be-largest-ever-to-utilize-kite-power/18005/) put out a lot of cost for this back in their pr marketing days.  Still don't really understand what happened with that... it seemed like a good idea and integratable into current ship designs via a retrofit ... vs requiring a redesign of ships altogether. 




  by weight

biochar is better measured volumetrically vs weight. different chars have different densities/porosities... thus, different weights. it's more a 'volume thing' than a 'weight thing'. 

 and results only popped up at the 2 and 4% rates, vs the 0 rate.

again, the weight/volume dynamic is more '[where it's at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPfmNxKLDG4)'  ...and, again, at *that* it just depends on what your application is. 

if it's, say, a potted plant or relatively shallow garden or raised bed, upwards of 10% by volume makes more sense. if it's a large acreage field... better to let it build up in the soil over multiple seasons/years than at once.  just relative to what you're growing, what your intentions are, cost, size, area. lots of variables to take into consideration.

 the pelletized BC sounds pretty cool

I'm torn on it personally. though it addresses your sentiments towards managing application (w/out it blowing away, for example), I personally am not a 'fan' of pelletized biochar. I think it's an unnecessary step and I, personally, prefer biochar that's a good mix of size   shape. The pelletized stuff ends up just granularizing or powdering ... granted, ultimately all of it will break down into a powder... but, I think a good mix (from, say, 'hockey puck size' at the *extreme* largest to 'sugar cube size' on down is better.   and *all* of it aged, of course ... unless you're going for more of an activated carbon use for the char... ie, remediation approach... then you'd *want* it 'raw' to pull in the 'things' you *don't* want active in the soil .... adding other amendments over time. but, again, this all brings it over more to a specific application and, thus, a 'consulting' type approach towards project-intentions.

 do you have a link

here's [*one*](http://blueskybiochar.com/DISCOVER_BIOCHAR.html) ... 

there's another buried in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iW-68fKVU0 feature=share) somewhere. Cool Planet is more or less 'just getting started' on a commercial scale. but, though 'biochar is now', biochar is *really* more 2020+ as far as an industry. the IBI, IBI members/community, and just the industry in general... from US to others are more pushing for a 2020-and-beyond deployment of biochar. it's 'still working out the understanding' ... and, will continue to do so. sure there are products now, and people selling it now, but... again, infancy. *may*be 'toddler' but... personally? I think it's still in the crawling phase. standing up a little but not really walking. *most* definitely still picking at its butthole   belly button and trying to discern the differences between the two, either way. 

 It's pretty piss poor on its own

...unless you're going for the specific application of remediation... then you *want* it on its own. but, otherwise, 'on its own' it's a 'momentary thief' that can take *years* to balance out. until then, throwing the soil into havoc   disarray. 

 microbes and nitrifying bacteria

even loading biochar with a product like SumaGrow has its limits. I mean, sure it loads the char with diazatrophs   PSBs which can help but... with nothing for them to 'eat' (nutrient-wise) in the char... it's more an exercise in futility. The char *really* needs to be pre-loaded before application.  at *least* with nutrients if not microbes as well. again, composting it is the best. though, there are other ways, composting is the best. 

preloading (chemical) fertilizers seems to help... initially, but, the plant has to go in and get it... (which it will) or the stuff just... it needs minerals (rockdust, azomite, SeaAgri, etc... or just compost) and microbes. otherwise, again, negative results and a long time waiting.

 The problem is there hasn't been any 10-20 year studies

again, the industry's picking its butt with it's spoon still. a lot of that will just take a while. i mean, you can't do a '25 year study' until 25 years have passed. ~2006? was when it was 'discovered' .. or at least was 'first publicly announced'?  we're not even a decade in, and the first few years were fetal, imo.    Age the char in compost for ~3 months, load it with nutrients, minerals, compost teas (even on an industrial scale) and create as homogenous a mixture as you get with, say, composted manure or just compost in general... .... then apply. the results will still take 'a season' to readjust. for the fungi, bacteria, etc to intermix with the soil the right way. for the whole area to become 'homogenous' in   of itself.... but, from there it's like hardened soil. i mean, sure you can kill off everything with chemical pesticides, fertilizers, etc but... the char isn't going anywhere. 

I posted a link to a study done a few years back (to /r/biochar) that dealt with hydrochloric acid   biochar in super agitated speed trial... with a pH *well* below anything you'd find (naturally) in the soil... and under 'agitation' that you'd unlikely find even under aggressive tilling... and the biochar broke down very little.  same was tested with ridiculously high pHs ... once it's in there it's in there. and, once it's in there it creates a 'bounce back point' such that once the b.s. is stopped, the 'growth' of the soil returns.   

It's kinda like those geological surveys that show a layer of ash all around the world from where vesuvius erupted, or some other volcano or super volcano.  get the biochar in the ground and the geological layering of it will remain there. burn back the soil that's built from it.... even atop it... and, still, underneath will be this layer of biochar from which things can return.   it's terraforming   geoengineering -capable on a mega scale. planet changing really if we wanted to take it *that* far. 

but, go with the atmospheric carbon levels. say carbon is brought down from 400ppm to 250ppm (ie ~1850/pre-industrial rev). and, it's done with biochar... there wouldn't be enough biochar to turn the world's current agricultural lands into a 10% by volume (in the top soil) level. (yes, the math has been done... somewhere way back when I ran across it, and it was pretty accurate seeming).  Could theoretically imagine going to the point of literally mining coal, n.gas, etc just to *release* carbon into the atmosphere to pull it out via biomass to make biochar with...  it'd take a *lot* of char to make a real dent. but, at the same time, it doesn't take that much to start it out. then it starts building on itself.

 I just don't think it's very good as a quick amendment, or on its own

it isn't... not on its own anyway. it *can* be a 'quick amendment' that's beneficial once it's blended, treated, and aged though.  then it's great. so are a lot of other things.... but, those other 'things' mixed with biochar (compost, compost tea, fertilizers, rock dusts   such, specific microbial strains, etc) makes for a potentially 'quick amendment' ... it's a part of a process, not some 'throw this on' and watch your ladybugs return or your bees sing   dance in flight like in A Bug's Life or something.

A farmer isn't going to buy   throw on biochar and expect to immediately get an ROI on it. nor would they a tractor, per se.  at least where they already owned a tractor that worked the same fields/area. It's a long term investment. but, so are the shrubs, trees, and other landscapings in my yard... i planted them when the house was built. they're still growing nicely. i fuck with them very little.  ...and, I *have* to fuck with them very little specifically because biochar is intermixed in the soil and, as such, they can tolerate stress well. I really have no desire to go out there and have to nurse my yard on a regular basis. nor do farmers. they have other operations they'd like to run. biochar saves them time, energy, labor costs, inputs, etc.  Farmers aren't generally the fastest changing people. some are, obviously, others not. but, most of the farms I know have been around for much longer than I have been. most of the land I know that's farmed has *been* farmed for, again, longer than I've been around .. and, presumably, will be so long after I'm gone (or developed into real estate... or blown up by Iranian   N.Korean nukes of the propaganda is to be believed).

 One thing I dislike, though, is the comparison of current BC practices to terra preta

b.c. in its current incarnation *isn't* terra preta. nor do i think going to a terra preta soil-type is necessarily the best. Science has moved forward *quite* a bit since whenever those soils were made. I'd much rather control the char, how its made, what its made from, etc... and then control what it's loaded with...   i don't know. maybe i've just built too many computers or subs (at subway) to want a cookie cutter model like that. Not to knock it, and not to say that, say, Soil Reef's or [Harvest's](http://www.lowes.com/pd_459653-79138-NFCOMP1H_0__?productId=4573226) pre-made product is bad, but I'd prefer to buy raw char (of a higher quality), then treat it with what I want to treat it with... *then* apply it. ... controlling it along the way. then, I'm a bit of a control freak so... to each their own?

The stuff we're capable of making today is capable of *much* stronger C=C bonds than the stuff open pit burning could do in the Amazon 500 years ago. or even now. Not to knock that approach, but 1500F in a highly pressurized steel container that has countless sensors and regulation points.. ... well, I'm gonna imagine that some of the char that's being made today will be around a VERY long time to come... *as* char. not just 'stable carbon'.  but, I'm with you on the 'nit pick'.   afterall, again, I'm a bit of a control freak when it comes to certain things :)

but, overall, think of biochar as a 'newly (re)discovered' 'material'. *like* rock dust, *like* gypsum, *like* compost/manure, etc... it's another 'ingredient' with which to organize the landscape... cultivating it into something we want. 
 




  The benefits of char only seem to be present and significant at high rates

I've actually found from both personal and readings that 'less is more' by   large. That negative results are more often recorded than positive ones (vs control) when applied 25% by volume.   but that smaller amounts... added continually over years... is the way to go. 5-10% year after year. 

Cool Planets pelletizes some of their products specifically for the fact that the dust blows around.  but once mixed with water and blended into the soil the pellets break up and the char 'spreads around'.

Mixing it with manure before applying with a manure spreader is a pretty common type of application.  

I've personally used power seeders to 'inject' it into lawns. 

The rate of 10-40t/ha is a really high number, imo. 5 metric tonnes per hectare is a lot more realistic. ...then, adding more every year or few years to build it into the soil layers. 

but, again, blending it with manure, compost, etc makes a lot more sense than the ridiculously naive idea of adding raw biochar to the soil and *not* expecting negative results.

the field/industry is still in its near-infancy. barely even a toddler if one yet. and once it does come around as a major industrial product (which is all but inevitable, imo), it will be a few select companies providing it. most that seem to understand this seem to be doing pretty well for themselves. it isn't going anywhere. it's 'new'. there's no real rush.  I see it as like a tractor or something: the first ones sucked. most laughed. it took decades+ to get a good model ... and even more advancements have been made in the *last* decade than the century that came before it. Biochar will really be no different.  ... obvious necessary adjustments being taken into consideration for the analogy as tractors   biochar are clearly totally different things.   but, cost of water, fertilizer, land, etc will all but necessitate it be incorporated in the future (imo). and, at that, [the future starts slow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwudqTCkBis).  at that, that's a good thing, imo. I'd rather add 5% a year every year than 25% once every 5 (years). and, at *that*, I'd rather age the 5% in compost or manure and pre-treat it with *other* amendments for a month or three (minimum) before adding it at *that*.  build it up within the soil layers over years to decades.

cheaper, the soil takes less of an initial 'hit', and the layering effect would start to build up over time such that after years-to-decades it starts to look like [this](http://fingerlakesbiochar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/terra-preta-soils.jpg) vs ... vs 'something else'.

  I think jumping on the divestment bandwagon is nothing more than a feel-good act.

how're your future on oil holding up? much of trading *is* following trends.

I'm not disagreeing with your general sentiment that this is more PR b.s. than something that will have a real effect on the industry at large.... but, people selling shares of something tends to drop the value of that something who's shares are being sold.

I've done more than my fair share of trading ... some of it based on logic, some of it based purely on watching the herd and timing my investment-moves accordingly: trading *is* herd mentality. 

Not that this will really make a dent in share prices but.... raising even greater awareness to it, if nothing else, seems like it could help bolster education elsewhere?

looking at their energy use can decrease their energy requirements... but they can also offset their footprint by building onsite energy facilities or buying offsets from renewable projects.

no. I'm too lazy   incompetent to set up a website.

 Compost the leaves. Find a tree company truck and call them. Ask 'em if they'll let you have some of their chips. They won't protest.

Just try to shoot for 'chips' and not 'shreds'. They tend to use different 'blades' based on the age of what they're 'chipping'. Newer branches get shredded, older parts of the tree get chipped. Both will work, but chips seem to work *better* as mulch 




  Is there a term for that I can research.

not that *I'm* aware of ... but definitely doesn't mean one doesn't exist

 Is there a more specific consensus in the bio-char community?

no. but.... 'those in the know' seem to have a pretty good understanding.. ...and, as such, are building/designing their products around it.. ..either directly manufacturing the 'char that way, or compensating on the backend where their equipment   feedstocks aren't capable of producing it that way 




 I'd imagine the increased microbiota in the soil are playing their part too? 




 /r/graphene 




 Pretty sure it's *already* a thing in Russia... from what I gather (and have seen personally), most Russian households have gardens to some capacity or another. ...and, most that I saw had pretty good sized ones at that.  




  But how can a farmer be certain it's a high quality product?

the IBI has quality standards? From last I checked they actually have a pretty liberal standard for what's considered biochar. There was actually a lot of fuss amongst biochar manufacturers *when* IBI was creating the standards (if memory serves) relative to the fact that they were setting the bar so *low* for how it was standardized.... ...or for what was necessary to receive an IBI label.

 I'm not a farmer

even gardening or houseplants would benefit from a higher quality char.

at that, there're really only a few manufacturers of biochar out there selling retail to begin with.... some are better than others, imo, but of the ones that're out there, they're *all* quality-enough from my research on them to *not* make any of that a problem.

On the heavy metals   PCBs... biochar would bind onto these... be it added from the biochar itself, or to the ones already in the soil.

It's *one* of the many benefits / points-of-adding biochar to *begin* with: it's binding to heavy metals and other 'toxins' in the soil... ...in such that the plants, fungi, etc can 'choose' what they want vs having it more-directly 'forced' onto them.

The *real* issue, imo, *isn't* an IBI labeling, but is more production temperatures.   Check out the Rice U study linked to in the sidebar.

the increased temperatures not only produce a more porous biochar, but also a more 'activated' one. ...as well stronger c-c bonds, in such that the biochar is likely to last *much* longer before breaking down.  The higher activation will make it all the more 'attractive' *to* toxins in the soil... and the higher porosity that (usually) coincides with this means that the 'char will have all the more places to store these unwanteds. 


I'm with ya on the IBI certification being a good idea... but anyone producing it at such high temperatures is using pretty complex   expensive machinery to begin with... ...the IBI certification costs would be minimal by comparison.  




  and you'd have to dig them out anyway!

or pressure wash 'em off with hot water :) 




 an IBI certification definitely seems to [provide that warm fuzzy feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5dpBpaFiMo) that helps you sleep better at night and pays homage to the IBI ... but I'm not sure it's necessary for a high quality product? 




 I've always wanted a snowmobile! But, still, when your entire front door (and rest of the city) is buried under multiple *feet* of snow in such that you can't even make it to your mailbox, how beneficial is a snowmobile really gonna be? Let a*lone* an ev? :P

I just had the mental image of an electric snowmobile pulling a trailer filled with either batteries or a generator for extra power :) 




  I suppose the cheaper cars would only be used for commuting

maybe? then again, I see plenty of Corollas on the interstate. No reason to think that people who invest their money elsewhere don't also like road trips?   

I'm just not sure that battery swapping stations like Tesla's building with its charging stations would really be geared towards 'cheaper cars'.  It seems more like a service those willing to pay for it would be willing to use??  ... I mean, Tesla's definitely aren't what I think most would consider 'cheap'. It'd also limit design-types to... ....well, then again, Tesla/Musk *did* open up their patents? Who *knows* who'll start utilizing them or *what* kind of standards will be created in the future?

but, at the same time, just getting charging stations in seems costly enough for the time being, let alone throwing in swappable batteries on top of that.. ...as well, the designs aren't even out there with the current models so... whether or not it'd even be backwards compatible is yet to be seen.

who knows what the future'll bring?

 Boston getting slammed

I'm not sure *any*where is really prepared for that level of snow... and letting social norms to continue.  I mean, multiple *feet* of snow seems like it'd shutdown a city like Stockholm or Moscow as much as Boston or NYC. ...obviously if a city like Miami got that much snow, we'd have more to worry about than batteries, either way :) 




 hope you enjoy 'em :) 




 the speakers on my M8 have *never* bothered me. in fact, I *prefer* the speaker on the front. would mind there being one on the *back too* ... for that matter.

the extra length it makes my M8 over my G3 has never. not once. ever. bothered me. honestly, didn't even notice it on this level (the extra space/room it takes up) until i read your comment and help them both up to each other. 

doesn't it make sense that she sound would be more preferred coming *at* you than away from you??   again, it makes a huge difference while using the device.. ... sure there's the 'awkwardness' of the phone's screen needing to face up when i put it on a table lest the speakers be covered up ... ...vs that nice great feeling of the screen facing down and almost 'suctioned' to the table/desk/whatever ... but, that's just kinda anal and something one gets over pretty quickly?? 

I mean, sure I'd prefer a back speaker as well.... esp if i put my phone on my nightstand screen/speaker-down and am using it for an alarm clock, but the speakers on the M8 are so much better than the G3 that even when I use *it* as the alarm clock *over* my G3 it actually seems to do a better job waking me up.

I don't know. to each their own? but it's a non-point from my usually overly-anal perspective ... ...a non point having them on the front from a negative. a *major* point *not* having them on the front from a 'looking-for-positives' perspective. the G3's speaker, or lack-of-speaker-quality is a major detraction from it over the M8. almost as bad if not worse than HTC's decision to use the ultrapixel camera over the G3's obviously *far* superior camera.  

suppose that last one just depends on where your priority is: speaker/music/videos or photographic purposes. i'm more the prior than the latter. both being awesome would obviously be preferred :) 




  it seems the world is moving forward faster than I thought

but, not fast enough... and after *way* too many delays and wrong turns... imo.  

 there's a lot of reading i need to do now

let me know if you find anything interesting. I'm clearly interested in it and obv have no problems chatting about it :) 




  I guess I'm worrying about it too much haha

yeah. that's my guess. I mean, I can't say it's not an issue... esp for more-northern climates but... batteries are warm, and, hot water is hot... snow, ice, slush, whatever doesn't really stand a chance.   also, who really cares if the random can't swap out their batteries? I mean, none of that stops them from being able to plug in?  and, if the snow's that bad... they prob have bigger issues than a battery swap :) 

 I feel is forgotten as the vast majority of EV innovation is happening in California where the weather is beautiful

yeah, but, these things are being shipped all over the US, and if you've seen the weather lately, Boston's been slammed,.. and there're Tesla's there.... and other so... besides, I'd imagine a lot of the people that live in Cali and are working on these things have lived elsewhere as well .... I don't know. i'll keep my eyes out for it over at /r/teslamotors but, I've followed that sub for about/over? a year now and have *no* recollection of ever reading anything about it.

other ev's? ie, smaller cheaper ones? well, again, we're talking about a niche-enough thing here. swapping out batteries is really only necessary when in a rush. ...road trips seem to add to that just so peeps can get on their way vs lodging out for x-countless hours at a rest stop or charge station... .....otherwise, people will just be local and, as such, plug-in under their normal conditions.  .... plus there's always the trailer :P 




 Robots are neat... screw employment. robots replace jobs left   right and will continue to do so. 

even in Tesla's promo videos they've made a major point to show people building their cars... *not* robots.  just robots *assisting* people.

but, at that, robots are awesome. if iRobot came around and I could have a personal helper monkey-bot? I'd take it in a heartbeat. maybe even a few of them.  I never agreed with Will Smith's stance on it all.  the whole 'chair story' is retarded. we already build rocking chairs with robots or in factories. what's the difference?

there's still an 'art' to it all... and if robots were as sophisticated as to run, jump, clean my house, and 'other' then hell yeah!  imagine how much shit could get done! 

could pull a Surrogates and take a robo-trip around the world.. different spot every day. just put enough cameras on a robot, throw on enough high quality mics and throw on a VR deal.... spend a half hour tele-controlling a robot in Spain only to get bored with that, tell the robot to auto-walk back home as you sign into the travelbot in downtown tokyo.

clean up trash, clear out abandoned sites. .. etc... robots rock. or could/will (most likely will)

I just kinda-sorta wonder the auto-bot battery changing thing. it seems like some redneck idiot would run it over. I know I probably would... by accident.  I still think at least *a* service tech would be there looking after it all.

and ... having an automated plug plug in my car is 'cute' in my house, but at a charge station? lol. it's just... really?? why??? it's a plug! not even a stinky gas pump! you just plug it in and push some freakin' buttons on a screen! I'd imagine my microwave is harder to use. (and it's made for idiots)

car wash cost: no reason it wouldn't be auto-debited to the account but.... .... yeah, there's a difference between a $65k car and a $15-20k one.

I dont' see the snow really being that big of a deal. I mean, of course it would be but there're 50 million people that live in areas of the US that never get snow. so, plenty of market where snow isn't an issue. where it *is* an issue also gets balls-hot in the summer... Chicago   NYC   Boston   Toronto-even are not free from hot-as-fuck summers. so, again, a minimal problem allocated to a smaller portion of the year (in the US... europe's different but... again, indoor swapping mixed with an undercarriage wash with hot water. problem solved?)

The undercarriage rush of a ICE car is because the mechanics are all underneath it.  in an EV it's pretty much just a battery. a sealed battery at that.  other than battery heat, which... with proper controlling isn't really an issue from what I gather... the undercarriage could be hard plastic or a thin sheet of aluminum or something. or just stainless steel.. but that's heavier. 

like you said, there're just a lot less parts on an ev, and even most of the parts it *does* have are covered.  i mean, suspension is suspension and such but... it's just a different design/build altogether... and, you're gonna get what you pay for... some cars will, simply, rust faster/more than others.

but, again, just don't see it as a big issue in the grand scheme of things that could become big issues.   ??? shrug

 




  I wasn't aware algae was so powerful

I wan't either!   but, better, it isn't just that it's 'powerful', it's that it has a wide range of hydrocarbon chain lengths.   corn, switchgrass, etc just have the sugars and they're 'eaten' by the microbes that make the ethane/ethanol.  but, algae also has this... ..as well has the long chain hydrocarbon oils that go up to C20 in length... and, of course, anywhere in the middle (well, the middle being H1 or 1H or H2 I suppose, as H1 doesn't really stay H1 for very long before becoming H-something... in the case of a container of pure H... H2 .. but, 1h - C20H42) . 

But, yeah, I mean, I knew the 'idea' of algae made sense.. but i always figured it was a land premium thing... like a 'if we ran out of land' or 'got sick of food-vs-fuel debate' or something we could always go to the sea and, thus, algae.  

but, in truth, it really works *nothing* like that.  I mean, I suppose you could make giant algae farms (and they do) but, why? when you can use a piece of crap land in California, dehydrated drought ridden soil fucked california... right next to the ocean that's *loaded* with pollutants...

and, pump that water in, feed it through a system like Algenol has, produce tons of fuel, as well the left over residual biomass can be recycled back into the system for feeding... or used to help improve soils (composted basically)

also, forgot to say, every acre of algenol not *only* produces the 9000+~1500 gallons of fuel (ethanol+mixed) ... it also produces something like 130-150 gallons of freshwater from the ocean water.

obv this isn't like a mind blowing amount, I believe I waste more every time I shit   shower but... that its '*makes*' freshwater ... *and* fuel... vs using it... ....it's gotta account for something??

You should check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlSwFaxIyzo) ... it's the intro video of a promo video series that Algenol put out in a 'special marketing'-like interview deal with the CEO. ... the whole thing is like 20 videos long? each one him answering an individual question. each designed to kinda-sorta sit alone as its own thing, or, if you watch all together it creates a consistency of course... but, the intro video above is standalone-standalone.  really recommend the whole series though. apologies I can't find the youtube mix of it all but it's there... it's like an hour long but seriously fascinating.  plus they *just* announced like a month ago that they got approval to make x-gallons of ethanol for fuel consumption.  but, they aren't 'in trials' (really), like, it's ready to go commercial now. $1 a gallon gasoline (from algae).  

[Cool Planets announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-2Am2howHk feature=share) their first full scale plant back in the fall ... pretty exciting there too. I really think the two would pair up awesomely together... the Cool Planet model and Algenol's ... esp that Cool Planet's first (commercial) plant is in Louisiana and Algenol's based out of Florida... if they could team up, Algenol utilizing the '[waste](/r/waste)' CO2 from the Cool Planet production process to feed their algae... the whole thing would be carbon negative as fuck and produce a *lot* of fuel. 

Exciting stuff either way ... but, regardless of that.. gas powered cars are awesome, don't get me wrong, and H-C chains are about as energy dense as it gets (even *with* [graphene](/r/graphene) supercapacitors coming down the line!) so... but, I see no reason an HC storage system couldn't be used to provide power to an electric car... via an ICE or a fuel cell or something along those lines.... efficiency in supply chain, battery swapping, etc  aside, filling up with HC chains is just too simple and too integrated into the global psyche at this point ... ..and, with the oil supplies of the world ramping up to massive production ... *right* as Cool Planet and Algenol and such are starting to come online... ... I don't see a reason to phase out HC-fueled vehicles... ....but, HC-fueled vehicles... that are powering an electric motor.  EV's also make too much sense. the energy conversion is just too high... with any loss of power in the system being inefficiencies and, thus, increased wear   tear... i mean, something like 98.xx% of energy that gets to an electric motor is converted into mechanical energy ... ICEs are lucky to get 35% ... the diesel VW is like 45%? ... hell, even stationary power plants are like 65%... it's just a lot of loss of energy from the engine to the generator... fuel cells have much higher conversions and... then that power in turn is communicated to the electric motor too efficiently ...

...but, again, HC-chains are super dense.

I'm not arguing we stay on the current model though... but, at the same time, *if* carbon negative HC-sources are used (ie, Cool Planet and Algenol) then why not??? in some ways, driving around *removes* carbon from the atmosphere!   so, hell, the 7 billion person globe *embracing* automobiles may actually *'solve'* climate change??

But, at the same time, hydrogen is hydrogen... be it in a C20 chain or an H2 molecule in syngas... and, that's the real breakthrough in 'tech' imo... pyrolysis. It's an old weird tech, and innovations are most definitely not glorious or headline grabbing ... but, be it bitumen coal to oil shale to petroleum to n.gas to algae to switchgrass to corn to landfill waste ... HC chains can be broken down into H1 (which quickly becomes H2) and burned in power plants.... the 'other' things in the gas stream separated out. ... coal, mercury, sulfur etc.. ....that electricity from the power plants can go on to charge batteries.

so, the idea with switchgrass or other (and i really like switchgrass, it's really 'woody', it has a high lignocellulosic value) is that it can be grown... it [grows incredibly fast](http://www.ethanolproducer.com/uploads/posts/magazine/resize/1328-1292434727-300x300-noup.jpg?1361327994), again, 10-15ft 2-3x a year... and [roots that grow nearly as deep](http://www.groundtradesxchange.com/forums/attachments/landscaping-design/3495d1238362111-should-all-types-grass-outlawed-landscaping-design-npgp5_rootsys.gif). it builds soil, helps retain water, has a low nutritional requirement (if it needs more nutrients, it'll just grow a larger root zone and deeper... which means, by default, it has to grow taller above ground to support the below ground roots... with photosynthesis).   but, all that carbon, or, 98%+ of it... that's in the plant *and* the roots... is atmospheric carbon.. removed and built. Trees have nothing on this stuff. maybe in density but *certainly* not in rate of growth.  the biochar produced from it [blended back into the soil](http://www.biochar-international.org/files/graphics/terra-preta.jpg) only serves to improve the soil that much more, retain that much more water, filter that many more pollutants, and sequester that much more carbon ... all the while producing energy... be it in the piss poor transport fuel of ethanol, or in the form of H2 for power plants (my preferred choice)... or both if you a.d. it before subjecting what's left to pyrolysis. 

that electricity? can, again, charge batteries. screw solar, screw wind, screw geothermal, screw hydroelectric-even. I mean, they're great in their respective places (residential roofs, wind ridges, backyard heat   cooling or Hawaii, Iceland, etc... etc) but, at best they're carbon neutral. at *best*. and as long as the guys driving to the plants are driving Fords, they're carbon positive.... be it for construction *or* maintenance.

Biomass is the only thing that's carbon negative... and it *is* solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, ...nuclear-even.  and it provides the flexibility of longchain hydrocarbons for energy dense fuels, to 'pure' Hydrogen for powerplant generation... and everything in between .... including easily stored materials in containers that dont' degrade all that fast, and integrates (like electricity) with an infrastructure we currently have.

but, with that, ev's *still* make the most sense. ...for *most* applications. 

I got off subject

 jobs are negatively affected

the way 'jobs' are 'solved' if efficiency took over is the same way communities the world over 'solve' it. I went to Trinidad   Tobago a few years back... no one worked. not really anyway. I mean, ~4 hours a day. or, 6 but in two 3 hour chunks.  Europe isn't all that different. you just create a nanny state of sort. ... if resource scarcity isn't an issue... there really *isn't* much reason to work.  containing or curtailing the subsequent baby boom is just a matter of educating and prevention. the smarter people are, the later they tend to wait to have kids, and the less they seem to have.  Look at Japan, IQ's that're way up there... their 100IQ is like 120IQ in the US. 125 maybe-even. their population is *shrinking*. the educated sections of India? shrinking in population. it's the uneducated masses of the planet that seem to breed like rabbits.

so, education. and... maybe a pro-IUD program? :) I like IUD's ... a lot... so... yeah. just push those out there like none other ... and come up with a male equivalent :) (vasectomies are *not* the same as a copper IUD. not at all!) population'd drop pretty quickly i'd imagine. thus, less jobs needed *for* 'jobs' to be a real political issue.  again, distribution   politics is the main issue, not capability-of.

it'll get there, or we'll fuck things up so bad we'll wish we had 




 I don't think so. they're usually on sale... possibly cheaper even. 

they taste a... well, the Pepsi tastes a lot better too, imo! like, a *lot* better. 

again, haven't tried the coke ...yet, but I don't drink that many soft drinks to begin with so...   but, I was just at a gas station and the Coke Life's were in a special fridge deal next to the counter and it had a big sticker implying a sale... i didn't cross with the price of a normal coke... granted, I didn't buy one either. quite simply, I forgot. :)

  but people are also lazy

not if the service guy is saying 'we can't change your battery unless you run it through a carwash' while pointing to the $5 car wash 50ft away.  

I have a ski slope of a driveway when it snows. I shoveled it last month but it was ice underneath. I hooked up my pressure washer to my hot water heater... melt-blasted off the ice. threw down salt. 

never underestimate what some hot water can do to some ice/snow :)    the whole thing? took less time than shoveling it.  after shoveling it I realized I should've just blasted it from the get go, melted the snow right along with it.   I don't imagine the undercarriage of a battery would be the coolest place anyway... as well, that *that* much snow and shit would stick to it while the car's going 80mph down an interstate for a few hours.... ....just a hunch though, but most ICE powered cars don't tend to have a lot of snow on their undercarriage ... 

but, again, if it comes down to 'plug in over there and wait three hours' or 'run through that car wash which your car needs anyway and I can swap it out in 15' I'd imagine the guy that's driving a $65k+ car is going to say, 'i've got $5' :)

 contamination   friction between the 'seams'

seal the seams? I mean, would this not be a problem now? I've never heard or read about it being one.  .. seems like it'd pop up as something someone would mention.  ...then again, how hard is it to 'seal' a case against 'gunk' getting in it? 

I'm sure the battery casings would need to be water proof anyway ... a nice 'rubber seal' around the edges and a small bit of force upon closing it seems like it's more than suffice to keep out most things... hell, even air possibly, but esp water.  ...seems to work for my Maglite anyway?

Well, the pallet jack manual system was what he told me they were using on the factory floor at Tesla.  motor-assisted, but still manually moved around.

I think the whole automation thing is a bit silly. I mean, I still get out and put a nozzle in my car to put in gas, why so hard to manually put in a plug? 

An iRobot battery deal may make sense when it comes to moving the things around on a charging station lot... i suppose, but, again, 95lb (hell, probably 85lbs, the girl's tiny!) 5ft girl at the grocery store was moving around a 1'000lb pallet of canned goods last night w/out too much trouble... i don't really see where a properly balanced 2'000lb battery stack would be a big deal? esp on flat paved ground designed for moving them around on? maybe a motor assist? I mean, it *is* tesla, throw in an electric motor segway-style that aids in moving it around upon 'directional-suggestions' by the attendant?  

i like robots, don't get me wrong... but, again, some of the stuff just seems 'silly' to overly automate. kinda 'teching out just to tech out' if you will.  




  Politics tends to get in the way of innovation

because politicians don't get voted in by technology but by voters. voters that have their jobs replaced by technology want new politicians to create jobs for them.  Inefficiency creates jobs.  what's that quote, 'reproduction for the sake of reproduction is the ideology of a cancer cell' - someone.   technology for the sake of technology is a joke. I've bought *so* many useless 'tech' items throughout the years ... and never used them.   ... as a piss poor example.

but, at the same time, if you streamline the hell out of something... like, *so* much that you make the process as minimal as possible... ...if you build devices that essentially don't break, 'light bulbs that don't burn out', etc ... you replace/reduce the need for both your labor *and* yourself as a business.  It's not in a business's best interests to denecessitate itself.  ... nor politicians either.   That line from Distinguished Gentleman where the head of Power   Industry tells Eddie's character, Jack Johnson 'the name you know!' that the fact that nothing gets done *is* the point of the system.

ideally there'd be very minimal everything.  it simply wouldn't be needed. government would be tiny, politicians (and their salaries) would be tiny, labor forces would be, etc.  I've unfortunately replaced the jobs of dozens of people throughout 'innovations' ... both in tech *and* approach (sometimes overlapping, sometimes independent of one another).  it's really weird-sad to watch someone's job disappear underneath them... and, to see the company realize just how less   less that individual is needed.  ...until that person either gets laid off (less often the case) or simply quits on their own (red stapler guy from office space notwithstanding). 

One guy i 'disinvented the necessity for' literally had a nervous breakdown and ended up in an institution for over a year. ran into him back in the fall after not having seen him in a decade.... guy was still a 'broken man' for all intents   purposes. ...granted, his shell shock/PTSD from 'nam didn't help matters any.  but, yeah... it's a 'sad thing' seeing someone's reality replaced underneath them.  ...and, people don't like it, so they tend to *not* vote for the person it happened under, and to *vote* for the person who most-convincingly promises to bring them back to the delusion of the dream.

that completely unnecessary rant aside... or, tying it back into the topic at hand... Tesla did something like that with Obama back in like '09 or '10... showed Obama how he could completely adjust the auto industry through tech   reapproach. the problem? Obama 'got scared' from how *I* interpreted the various articles... because at first it created jobs... but then it reduced labor force over like 4 years down to 10% of what it was (within the auto industry) and then in another 4 years down to 10% of *that* ... ie, like 1% of the people in the automanufacturing business would be employed .   cars would be better, stronger, lighter, faster, more efficient, last longer, and.... well, again, Obama was 'terrified' by what it meant. Didn't tell Musk *not* to do it, but said that he couldn't incorporate it into gov't policy. 

AT T back in the dot.com fiber layout deal was the single largest employer in the US. the fiber optic / internet infrastructure all but replaced their inefficiency. as a result, hundreds of thousands got laid off.  ... and that was directly. hundreds of thousands more of ancillary jobs were lost during the readjustment. (insurance agents, car/health/life/etc, restaurants, service industry shit, etc ... simply because the money wasn't there from the core employees for them to, in turn, afford the secondary businesses).  If AOL *hadn't* bought TW... and a massive gov't 'thing' hadn't stepped in to convolute the entire infrastructural innovation, injecting all sorts of (temporary-yet-still-prevalent) inefficiency into the system, the dot.bomb blowout would've been even *worse* than it was.  in many ways, this most-recent recession is just a continuation of that... Bush's massive borrowing really just being a temporary injection or distraction from it. a 'max out the credit lines' approach towards survival.

 ethanol from corn

check out /r/biofuels, /r/biochar, /r/pyrolysis, /r/syngas, /r/gasification, /r/anaerobicdigestion, /r/biomass, /r/... ...well, check out the subs I mod. I post about it a bunch. I see the 'future' of biofuels as being [algae](/r/algae) ... from an efficiency perspective. I see [switchgrass](/r/switchgrass) as being a great land-crop vs corn. It has an EROEI of about 10-15:1 that of corn. it provides habitats, and, if gasified via pyrolysis, you get biochar ... so, essentially [carbon negative grassoline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkYVlZ9v_0o).  the initial sugars can be extracted via anaerobic digestion, of course, then the remaining pulp can be used for paper, building material, etc... or gasified via pyrolysis (after gasification via anaerobic digestion) to eek out those last remaining hydrogen atoms from it... and, blend the biochar back into [agricultural](/r/agriculture) lands or use as a building material of feedstock for [graphene](/r/graphene) production.  

or just straight gasify the switchgrass via pyrolysis from the get-go and blend the /r/syngas with [n.gas](/r/naturalgas)  like ethanol with [gasoline](/r/petroleum) ... or just straight burn it outright as a n.gas replacement... ...syngas is basically CO/CO2+H2 ... so it's more difficult to store than CH4/methane/n.gas ... but, that leaves n.gas infrastructure *for* stored fuel.... ....honestly, 'screw' diesel, gasoline, ethanol, etc .... .... refueling stations should be n.gas. our cars should've been n.gas decade(s) ago... the 'gas stations' (refueling stations, whatever word or phrase needs to exist to best describe the intended purpose of what these are) already have n.gas lines running to them... ...most do anyway... just have [the grid](/r/thegrid) refuel an underground storage tank with cng and then fill the cars up from there... ...cut out the fuel trucks altogether.   then use electrolysis on the n.gas to break apart the CH4 and you get all the H2 you need for fuel cells... the C? hold onto it. combine it together or mix it with atmospheric O2 via a catalytic converter and make CO2 out of it.... have the 'bladder' in the tank inflate... so, as the methane bladder deflates (because the n.gas is being pumped out to fuel the fuel cell) take the emissions and pump them into a secondary bladder inside a larger tank.... ...puts pressure on the methane bladder to keep output pressure up, as well closes the loop on the CO2 and stores it in the car.  make a plug-type that both 'sucks out' the CO2 at the same time the CH4 is being pumped in.... ... as the tank is being refilled.  

the CO2 is 'sucked' into an underground tank... and a truck comes by, fills up with it and takes it to a central facility that in turn uses it for whatever purposes CO2 is used for... carbonation of beverages, greenhouse fertilization, or... Algenol, for example, is actually *buying* CO2 to use as a feedstock for its algae farms....

corn gets something like 150-175 gallons of ethanol per acre per year. Algenol is getting 9000 gallons of ethanol per acre per year... *plus* ~1500 gallons of other hydrocarbon-types (methane, rocket fuel, diesel, butane, pure hydrogen, 'gasoline', etc... that '1500 gallons' is a mixed bag).  ...the algenol? carbon negative to carbon neutral.  Algenol can also be grown on lands you'd never *think* to put a a tractor for even *switchgrass* (which is a broadcast seeded perennial... ie, you throw out the seed and plant once. ever. not yearly, not every few years, once. period0. ... let a*lone* a plow for corn.  you could build an algenol factory on fucking rock... and pump in ocean water. that's it's *main* limitation is the need for ocean water... so it limits, say, ... well, no, not really. it doesn't limit anywhere. maybe central kazakhstan or mongolia or something.. but, even then, not really. you can pump sea water to those places.  obv Iowa or Kansas don't make sense to do this with... too far a pipeline, too fertile of land to need to... but, Utah? it's 'easily accessible enough' ... same with Nevada, Az, New Mexico if done right.

corn is a joke. it's unhealthy, fattening, and not as tasty as alternatives. switchgrass is awesome and i'm partial to it because I'm a fan of biochar. but, i recognize algenol as possibly being a better alternative. more efficient anyway. but, switchgrass is a native grass. wildlife evolved here for tens of thousands of years living within it. it's harvested when nesting patterns aren't really big anyway, and when they are, switchgrass is growing so... it provides habitat for local wildlife. it grows 10-15ft 2-3x a year cut, bailed   harvested using the same equipment as hay... (gotta make sure sharp blades and such... 'heavier duty' hay bailing equipment, but, same stuff).  builds soil, sequesters carbon, retains water, etc. the stuff is basically the 'solution' to carbon induced climate change.

anyway, i digress.

diesels are bigger around the world because the rest of the world doesn't ship shit by truck like the US does. they have trucks, of course, but, not like the semi's   interstates the US has. they use rail a lot more elsewhere. that leaves more diesel left for cars. the US made an unspoken decision to make gasoline for consumers, diesel for industry like 50 years ago, and hasn't looked back.   a few exceptions aside.

yeah, basically OnStar is where I was going with that. but, OnStar-smart because it could tie into the car's cellular connection.

battery tech a decade ago... it wasn't. but, it was at the same time. there could've been a smaller fuel tank and more room for batteries. smaller trunk space, etc. again, politics. also, at-home charging is slow... even over 240v 




 yeah, I've seen that video... lots of them actually. but, that one almost in particular was what was running through my head when i typed that.

It isn't so much the transport on that level... I feel that part's pretty well down.

like, case-by-case I don't see transport as an issue. It's the scale, and the number of variables that have open opportunities for human or mechanical error to come into play.

Like I said, I'm all for storing the stuff... and, thus, storing it somewhere that's not necessarily immediately accessible to the plant... Louisiana is a long way away from, say, Ny or Oregon or wherever nuke plants are... ... 

it's just he entire supply chain. people slack off. get lazy. have bad days. ... ...politics   other pressures intervene. budget cuts, environmental groups.   f'ing gremlins.  whatever the countless myriad of 'things' that happens when 'shit doesn't go right'

look at the services industry.... sure on a day to day scenario, shit works... but, go talk to a computer tech or phone tech person... ... or just a simple car mechanic... or plumber ... constantly 'things' are f'ed up.  for the most part they work, but on a case by case scenario, each 'thing' has its own set of problems.

lots of redundancy, lots of annoying safety protocols, lots of observation, ... tons of observation. 

moving around a train filled with nuclear waste isn't something that should be done 'in a rush'.

but, that said, yeah, I think the basic individual variables are in place ... *except* the long term storage site.

for that, Yucca is a joke. always has been, imo. 

there are just too many inherent flaws in it... ...over, again, the salt domes.  hell, the salt domes are *why* we use them for the strategic petroleum reserve ... they're 'war hardened' super safe, and designed to get through whatever the latter half of the 20th century was going to throw at it.

I believe they can even take direct hits from nukes and shit.  like, even a drilling bunker buster nuke would only make it so many feet into one, blow up, and, all the salt would just 'fuse together' and 'heal'.  they're on levels of stability that are so for over a hundred million years.   dinosaurs have risen, fallen, re-risen, and been wiped out entirely since those things formed ... and, they're set to last another 250 million years into the future. 

*that* Yucca was even considered over those is beyond me.
 




 well, it's also almost impossible to do.

with pretty much every. single. app. on a phone requiring permissions that give it up anyway. with every web service tracking you, location, date, time, etc ... it's all but unavoidable anyway.

I'm totally with you on the defense mechanism part... part of me is definitely like that... i mean, how *does* one really escape it?  and, that's where it transcends that... ... you can't. and, as such, fuck it, why care? how could you?

outside of basic 'common sense' on downloading an app from a link sent to me by my long lost nigerian royal cousin.... how do you avoid it? not download angry birds? not download the local tv station's weather app?

I don't really think 'escaping it' is easy or, for that matter, all that possible ... if 'they' want to find you they'll find you. if 'they' want to find out things about you, they'll find out what they want about you.   escaping 'they' is impossible, for the most part.

most people are more concerned about how their friends   neighbors on facebook view them than their government. ....and, understandably so, honestly.

but, at the same time, 'they' don't make it easy *to* be more discrete.  I mean, look at the fuss 'they' are putting up about google   apple encrypting data by default?

how hard would it really be for google to implement a '2-step verification' plug-in for gmail whereby the email is encrypted on the local computer with a password that's given to the recipient via some other means (than email)?  

how hard is it to establish a 'handshake agreement' with someone from a security perspective... I meet someone new, within a few days, one of us sends out an f.book friend request to the other... ... build in a security exchange along with this... whereby all interactions between us are encrypted based upon that.  simple. not super-hard by any means and.. could be implemented into a system pretty easily ... in such a way that it's *not* ridiculous.

if chrome can remember every one of my passwords in such that i only need to remember the password for chrome/google... why not have a gmail/facebook/whatever system to the same with the individual passwords for each friend's encryption?

I think my point is, if i have one... the technological capabilities to lock this stuff down to make it extremely difficult (if not downright impossible in many cases) isn't the issue.  nor is even the situational structural aspect... hell, not event he political 'code' necessary for it... ....but, like with google/apple encrypting data by default, 'they' don't want it.  and 'they' will make anyone/company trying to implement something like that's life hell.  breathing down their neck, intimidation, audits, etc.

oh, the point: care/not-care... people can't really do all that much about it one way or the other. if they do, they cut themselves off from things the rest of the 'herd' is doing. people want to feel like they belong to something. 




 then hits a drone on their way down 




 I'm actually not entirely opposed to the burying of nuclear waste... ...as long as it's done safely.

...once the idea that the 'waste' part is b.s. ... with much of it being unrefined or in-need-of-being re-refined fuel... once that is 'filtered out'

the rest of the stuff that doesn't otherwise burn up easily in a thorium reactor or something .... well, if it's radioactive, it has extractable energy ...  basically that mentality

but, the crap that's too low grade to really be worthwhile? or that has a much lower EROEI?  why *not* bury it?

The idea that people seem to forget that the uranium ore was radioactive *before* it was ever mined seems to be something I never read about.

that the low grade stuff is put back under ground, and in such a way that it's thought about, controlled, monitored, and with some degree of forethought ... makes sense to me.

I've been arguing for salt dome storage for years now.

the salt mines and salt stores in the Louisiana area... or in Germany... have been geologically stable for like 100 million years... ... more so, they will *continue to be* for an estimated 250 million more.   they 'self heal' ... so, if any geological event happens, earthquake, volcano, asteroid whatever.... the salt just heats up and melts together... usually even stronger than before.

leaking is essentially impossible, and again, geological stability thousands to tens of thousands of years longer than the waste would ever be radioactive.

getting it there? that's the tricky part just asking for accidents, spillages, etc ... .... not to mention the idea that once we have a place to 'dump something' we seem to ramp up our rate of production of said shit being dumped ... ... but we do that anyway even when we *don't* so... 

but, storing low grade nuclear waste underground (*after* sorting out the high grade, energy rich/energy-dense stuff for reprocessing!) just makes a lot of sense to me. Why *not* do it? ... if conditions are right. 

Yucca mountain is, was, always had been always will be a stupid site for storage. an intentional waste of money, imo.

  That or a demographic shift

...or that Brazil has leveled *more* rainforests, diverted *more* water, and planted *more* sugar cane over the past few years than ever before ... ... once all this 'excess oil' is allowed to be exported from the US, once Iran's sanctions are lifted, etc ... the developing nations' demands for oil (and ethanol) are going to go through the roof...

...and, Brazil's ag economy right along with it. The glut is temporary at best. 'temporary' may mean 2-5 years like they're saying with oil prices... but, temporary nonetheless.  




 but, they did just release [Coke Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_Life) ... and Pepsi's had the 'real sugar' deal for a while now... thank god! first with the 'throwback' and now with the [Pepsi True](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi_True).  

I haven't tried the Coke Life yet, just saw it for the first time the other day ... but I've been drinking the Pepsi Throwbacks and Pepsi True since they first brought them out / switched-them-over.

granted, i don't drink a lot of soft drinks, maybe a 12 pack a month, tops... but, the Pepsi throwback/true product has kept me away from coke when given the choice for a while now. glad 'real sugar' is coming back ... even *if* sugar is satan 




 Rum! 




 The renting concept is right in line with models that've been around for *decades* so it isn't a deviation or major alteration in mindset.  it's nothing 'ground breaking' by any means.

I suppose there'd be no reason you couldn't rend a *car* for the trip... as *well* as a charger... though, that'd be... silly?  I don't know, maybe not. not my forte either way.  but, basically a lo-jack system built into the trailer to keep up with it. I pay $100 a month for multiple phones on my plan, essentially unlimited data, and more minutes than I've ever thought about using.... to factor something similar (or cheaper on a larger corporate account) with sprint or AT T or whomever, and have it built into the trailer like a tablet has a cellular connection built into it... would be super cheap   easy. and, again, no deviation from 'things' we already have today.

and, that it'd not just be an 'anti-theft' system, tracking, etc... but also a system monitor, connected to the main tesla database (or whichever service) and, in turn, that being connected to your phone, car, app, computer, 'account'... 

 (I mean some would happen, but probably the same amount as cars get stolen nowadays)

and/or trailers. stealing either comes with a pretty hefty legal sentence. and, dealing with the legalities of these things kinda-sorta *as* 'cars' .. or, well, again, the analogy of a tablet from a cell provider with a cellular connection/chip in it... it's not the primary product/service the business carries (selling cars), but it's certainly not  a major deviation from that...   so, um... yeah, steal one of these, get tracked,get caught, go to prison. I'd imagine they'd have their own license plate... most trailers do. all cars do. not far fetched to think that these would as well. ...and, they are, technically, weight on the road, so to think that there'd be some sort of annual 'road tax' on them isn't too far fetched either.  ... hell, if [motorcycles](http://www.texelent.com/images/backview.jpg) can have [trailers](http://www.coolcustomtrikes.com/ygp49c.jpg), why not an ev??


 the longer the trip is, the more you can swap them out every 800km or so

the battery-swap model really makes a lot of sense. just pull up to a dealership/charging station... one you 'checked into' at the last one to 'reserve your trailer' as well 'estimated time of pickup' and... drive to the next one, pull in, attendant pulls off the one, loads on the other... checks it all to make sure it meets insurance specs, you're back on your way.   ....swapping out a trailer is *certainly* easier sounding than the battery swap deal... and, again, the extra weight wouldn't be a major killer for the car as the whole thing would've been pre-designed to work with the car(s) to begin with.    The battery-trailer gets fast-charged and is ready for the next customer. 

thing is, I came up with the basic idea for this 6+ years ago? maybe longer? such as to say, it isn't a major deviation from 'common sense' or 'that makes sense' for anyone thinking about it... ...I'm really surprised something like it wasn't just straight built in to ev models 10+ years ago.   granted, I'm also really freakin' surprised the first hybrids weren't plug-in hybrids by default.

then again, at the same time, I'm also blown away that corn is the only feedstock used for ethanol. .... all others (switchgrass, algae, etc) have to be fought for tooth   nail.  why do subsidies for such things have to exist solely on *corn*? why not 'ethanol' in general? regardless of feedstock.   ... I know I'm jumping subjects but I really think that, in the end, it's pretty clear that politics is the real limiting variable here *not* technological capability ... or business model design. 
 




 well, the batteries in *that* design were in a 'tray'... so, the bottom of the tray is what'd get 'road slushed' ... the batteries were tucked safely inside.  the 'trays' dropped down   out like an under-the-desk keyboard... ...that's *not* in just a slide-out-drawer design...

and, well, it'd be done on a flat gas station like surface, maybe a pull in garage carport style?  but, I don't see where the winter conditions would *really* change anything too too much.

I mean, last night after I typed that last message I went to the grocery store and a like 95lb 5'4 employee-girl was moving around a pallet of canned goods on a [pallet jack](http://www.handtrucksrus.com/pallet_lifts/272149%20[zoom].jpg) with seemg-ease... so a specialty designed deal and a 'trained   licensed' (and usually 'male'0 employee would doubtfully have a huge problem with it?

but, also/again, this was like 2 years ago... i mean, just-over a year (fall 2013) when I talked to the guy, and he'd owned the car for at least a few months before that, plus the design itself probably at least 6 months before that so... a 2 year old design, and, well, in thelast two years /r/teslamotors will clearly show you that something like that *hasn't* come out (yet) so... ...it may've just been something they were *testing*...  but it made one helluva lot of sense to me.

I suppose if the problem is really bad (mud, snow-slush, etc), they could always run the car through a heated car wash first??  It's not like Tesla owners would be poverty-stricken people whereby a $5 heated car wash would put them out much ... and, if there's that much slush on the car, it's definitely in need of a good bath anyway.... 

on the 'fresh cells'... 

it was more set up (from how it sounded) like you'd just swap out all 4 'super-quads' per fill up.  all the maintenance of each pack and such was done on the back-end/tesla side of things.

what the driver would get during their 'fill up' or 'swap out' (ha! just had an mental image of a buddy telling me: 'yeah, i'll be right over, heading out in 10 then gotta head to the station to get a 'swap out' and I'll be right there... see ya in a 'half hour'! ... ....vs, 'gotta swing by the gas station and fill up then i'll be right over' ...ah, the future :) 

anyway... yeah, the idea that i gathered was that all 4 super-quads would be swapped, tesla would do all the charging, checking, maintenancing ... cross referencing the data off of the data in the car / memory chips of the quads/packs ... ...distance, time since last swap, charge/discharge cycles, rates, frequencies, etc.  all of that would, for the most part, be monitored by tesla.   if any of the cells were going bad, the pack would be either done on site or, if 'so far gone', a pick-up   take-to-factory woudl be scheduled. ... ...newer battery tech could be swapped in on the fly as well.   the corporate computer system would have various algorithms that 'figure out how' to most efficiently lay the cells out ... ...all the guy at the station would be doing is... well, they' be a glorified battery swapper following instructions on the screen and maybe barcode scanning things along the way.  I don't imagine the job would be too too higher-paid than a minimum wage deal.  Maybe a small premium but... say, a PF Chang's server vs, say, an Applebees one... a McD's employee may be a bit 'below' the paygrade of one of these guys.  your average geek squad employee would prob be about what the job would look like, or, maybe a Best Buy sales floor guy doing the swapping and basic b.s. and a geek squad employee behind the counter doing the battery swaps and basic 'checking'... Sprint's model works: sales floor person doing the swapping, car wash crap... ...person behind the glass window doing the 'servicing of the phone' ... deciding on whether they can fix it in-store or if it just makes more sense to send it back to the factory .

but, the charge controllers are, from my understanding, all pretty standardized... ....like cell phones. the charge controller for phones is built into the phone itself... the only thing the average user really has a choice in is whether they're going to use a 1amp charger or a 2.1amp deal...  and, again, the phone's controller (or car's in this case) would regulate the flow to the cells to ensure a balanced charge ... ...and store the statistics of it all (as I understand they already *any*way) which would then be stored on the on-battery/on-pack chips, as well within the Tesla's computer ... all to be 'uploaded via wifi' to Tesla. 

A subscription model is basically where it's at.  the rest of the maintenance is done on the backend and is included into the cost of the subscription... the larger maintenancing (the 'oil change' type stuff.. once a quarter, once a year type things... brake pads, rotation, alignment, etc..) being done at whatever regular intervals I gather Tesla owners already get notifications for..... I gather that the car has a pretty heft amount of sensors on board and the computer is constantly monitoring the health of the systems. ....

cars basically = computers/phones at this point. the 'cells' of a battery not being much different than the 'cells' of an SSD, the load balancing (of the individual cells) not being much different between a battery   an individual cell on an SSD.  the same basic concept *any*way.

I feel like i'm kicking a dead horse. 




 Found [this](http://www.gsmarena.com/lg_g4-6901.php) on the G4.. and haven't heard *any*thing about a 'mystery higher end series' but it makes perfect sense.  ...imagining what'd be in it though?  maye higher quality speakers? curved screen with something other 'special' about it? maybe something like Samsung's Edge thing? (seems dumb though).

I like the M9, and I *really* like the rumored E9's specs... but, not sure I'm really into the special screen crap (flex/curved, edge stuff, etc).  the speakers could definitely use some upgrading from the G3... compared to the M8, or just in general, the G3's speaker is pretty *weak*, imo. Was really surprised they went with *that* low quality of a sound system 




 Maybe after Arnold's Mr Freeze saves his wife he can turn good and figure something out. 




 part II

kinda sorta the same thing as swapping. but, the idea of renting one would be 'to make it to the destination' ... so, say, you live in Chicago but want to drive to, say, NYC... you won't need to *own* a trailer (which you could if you wanted to, but if you're only using it to drive to Aunt Edna's in Manhattan once a year, why own a $15k trailer?)...  you just go rent one from the dealership..  but, again, in this seamless 'app' style prearranged rental agreement deal.  when you leave on Friday after work, you pick up your Chicago-trailer at the dealership/rental place.  drive to NYC, drop it off at the place in NYC... spend your week in manhattan... go back and pick up another one for your drive back... ...be it the same one, a different one, who cares? what's it matter? you're keeping it for a day to drive the 800 mile trip.  at night? you can stay at a hotel with a charge station, or, you can just stay at some $50 a night MicroTel and leave the trailer hooked up to the car... and the trailer will run through the night charging the batteries of the car up.... then just fill the trailer with fuel before you leave whatever-smalltown-Pennsylvania you crashed in for the night in case the 250 mile charge   150 miles in the tank isn't enough to make it because you stopped at 350 miles instead of 400 in 'cause it was friday night and you'd worked all day/week.    trailer filled with gas when you drop it off? costs less than the gas charge the dealership/rental place is going to charge you.. ...just like what happens when you rent a car.  bring it back at the same place it was when you picked it up? $0 fuel charge. bring it back empty, they charge you 150% going rate for fuel + a fill up fee just because they can.

the biggest deal here? it uses an already existing infrastructure (gas stations) and, thus, an already existing fuel-road tax because, afterall, you *are* using road fuel (road gas/diesel) ... vs farm grade fuel.

but, while in your destination? you don't have to fuck with the trailer 'cause you dropped it off. 

if it's *your* trailer? again, make them 'parking spot safe' .. so, make it lock up nicely like a car.  thus, someone stealing your trailer or breaking into it would be like stealing or breaking into a parked car... would be even cooler if the system had a built in cellphone type device.. like how the tesla has its own cell connection deal... just so it's 'connected ot the grid' too... ie, your phone/devices. that way if it *is* broken in to, it doesn't just 'beep' or 'honk' (like a car), but it also sends you a message, turns on audio so you can listen, has gps, as well has the ability to call the cops to report the theft in progress... and, of course, track it notifying you/the police where it is until they can arrest the fuckers who tried to jack your shit.

back to oil companies still getting a piece? yeah, absolutely. sure they lose funds for ev's around town... ie, 99% of the time.. people can just fill up at home off solar, wind, geothermal, the grid, whatever ... ....but, they're losing that anyway even now (not really, they own the patents on all the batteries. oil companies aren't losing shit) ... but they get the money for the 'long hauls'. 




 well, I was thinking about it more (remembering it more) after I wrote that ... this was a 'mock design' they had in the factory. this was also over a year ago so, following the news, it looks like they'd taken a different route.

I forget how the batteries actually are, but this battery engineer designer...

the design they were using in the factory was.... .... let me reword how he described it.

underneath the car were 4 'super packs'.  a front-driver, rear-driver, front-passenger, rear-passenger.

they sat on a 'tray' that would 'drop down' ... down and 'out' pivoting out past the tires as it dropped.

in each of the four 'super packs' were 'rails'   I believe 5 rails each... each rail was a double-wide pack of 4-AA sized batteries in a single pack.

so, the 4 batteries were in serial acting as a single battery (ie, whatever singular voltage the batteries were rated for, they *weren't actually double-A's or they'd be 1.5v.. but they were playing around with the idea of them *being* AA's to reduce cost via volume) .... then the 4-AA packs acted in parallel with the other 4-AA packs in the 'rail' ... to increase the voltage.. ...as well, each parallel design allows independent charging... so, though each individual AA isn't getting charged independently by the whole system, each 4-pack of them is.

This parallelism allowed for much faster charging.  as well, it narrowed down the problems with 'bad cells' to within a 4-battery level of focus... and, at that, they were even working on software that would allow them to 'time' the current being tested to predict which cell within the 4-AA-pack was bad.  at that, you could take out the individual batteries, you coudl take out the 4-AA pack, you coudl take out the rail, or you could take out the 'super-quad' 

at *that*, there was something like an angle-mounted dolly... with motors.   whereby, the 'super-quads' would drop from under the car, the 'dolly' would come up, grab the first 'super-quad', and, as it pulled back to grab the second/next 'super-quad', the one it'd already grabbed would get pulled up... kinda like a bullet coming up in the clip of a glock or something.. .. but, the dolly was angled back \  like that... with the car being on the 'right' so, \ -dolly c- car ... \c   ...the previously 'grabbed' super-quad would slide up and back towards the dolly operator, freeing up the loading arm to grab the next super-quad... process would repeat until the first pack was at the top of the 'dolly-clip' ... last-removed super-quad was at the bottom.  

dolly operator would then roll the super-quads via the powered/motorized dolly to a charging terminal... would set it in, the bottom pack 'lining up first' and then stand the dolly-arm up vertical in such that the remaining three super-quads would all be stacked vertically... and, the whole thing would 'lock into place' with the charging station.   that 'super quad' would be like 3ft x 4ft or something (so it could sit on a 4x4 pallet for shipping, if need be).   ... and, the dolly-operator would grab another dolly of already charged packs and repeat the process in reverse... loading the already-charged batteries into the Tesla... whole process taking 10-15 minutes tops.  

the charging station would then analyze the 'super quads' as well all the cells within them... down to an '*actual-accuracy*' of battery health of each 4-AA sized packs... ...and, an accurately predicted accuracy of even the health of the 4-cells individually within that. 

also, each 4-cell pack had a chip on it, each rail had a chip on it, and each super-quad had a chip on it.  each individual AA-cell had a serial number, and each was known where it was loaded in the 4-AA pack.  and, all of those serial numbers, in turn, were uploaded to Tesla... ...as well, the computer in the car could keep track of which cells it was pulling power from... ...so the whole thing, like an SSD hard drive's management software... knew which cells had been used more regularly vs other ones.  that way it could 'even the load' across them to help the batteries age evenly.  each never charing so quickly, or discharging so quickly/consistently as to heat up (minimizing fires) as well maximizing cell-life.

when the cells were in question, the tech, on their off time (or the factory itself... as they'd just be loaded onto pallets and shipped to the factory) would be able to pull apart the quads (really easily... like, remove a cover easily... then slide out a rail)... ...slide out a rail, access the 4-AA pack in question, pop it out, and then pop out the 4 batteries inside it ... but, even this was going to be designed to be automated ... in such that the super-quad in question could be inserted into a diagnosis machine that would be able to 'slide' 'pins' between the individual cells... *all* of them in the super-quad... individually but at once...   and charge-test each of them individually/independently of the other AA-cells in the pack.

the tech, in their 'off time' when not swapping batteries would then swap the individual cells from the packs and replace them with new ones... scanning the 'barcode' or rfid or whatever that each individual AA-cell had on it and marking where in the pack it was.  as well, rearranging the order the cells were in the pack, if need be, as how the computer/system suggested would provide the most balanced load/unload time such as to maximize both cell life and minimize cell charge time.

and, on the super-quad chargers... they were even looking into making the diagnosis constant... like, every time it woudl happen. not just during 'maintenance times' ... and, this would, in turn, allow for each individual cell to be charged at a time, vs 4 at a time but only at '1.5v' ... so, they'd be able to charge *all* the cells at their independent voltage ... vs, say, 4 cells, but at 1.5v ... ie, 6v per 4-AA-pack.

and, then, the 'modularity' of it would be that the 'older designs' (that just charged the packs) would 'trickle down' to new charge stations, as the new 'charge all cells independently at once' *as* ***well*** *as* 'diagnose each individual cell independently of each other cell in each 4-pack' systems move into place. shifting it all around so as to be either evenly distributed, *or* maximized based on peak demand.   obviously 25 teslas pulling in once a day in downtown LA during rush hour would take priority over BF-Ky's charge station where speed and/or peak-demand was a bit less of an issue.  

This would not only make 'battery swapping' a 15 minute affair, but would make *charging* an entire super-quad something along those lines as well.

again, this was all 'in the works' stuff.. that, apparently *isn't* what's being deployed... ...yet, as this isn't something Musk announced when he last announced the X/X-supercharger but... definitely something they're working on.

the cells that were bad? would get pulled, sent back to the factory and recycled.  but, again, the whole thing was just fascinating to hear him talk about.  and, being a retired electrical engineer that was also a prof for a while, he not only understood it, but knew how to explain it as *well*.. which was really neat.

the trailer/propane idea... yeah, basically. thouh, maybe better to give an 'up front discount' ... like, anyone that owns the car can rent one... but, if you buy the prepaid annual membership (think costco or something) where whether you use it or not you're still paying $x a year.... but, if you *do* pay that $x a year upfront membership fee (built into the original car loan at time of purchase!) you get a discount when you go to rent one.

 




 I'm a big HTC fan but I think it's still badass how LG is essentially a year ahead of everyone else techwise. ...or has been for the past year anyway.

I mean, a year after the G3 was announced, the M9 comes out with almost the exact same specs ... even lower in some cases; no removable battery, lower mAh on the battery, slower clock speed, smaller screen, lower pixel density / lower ppi, still has a higher quality camera (13mp vs 20mp, sure, but the 13mp is higher quality and has image stabilization) , cheaper and weighs less.

I also got my G3 for free with a 2 year contract... back in early August. 

again, I'm a pretty big HTC fan, and the M9 is certainly a really nice phone... but even it's yet-to-be-announced big brother the E9 doesn't look like it'll match some of the G3's nearly-year-old specs 




  I was imagining a system that you can swap batteries out 

I ran into one of the local tesla owners in my area in a parking lot of a grocery store about a year or so ago. Guy's like 75, was with his 95 year old mother... bowtie wearing, was like midnight. was on the phone, waiting for something to happen when all of a sudden 'it' pulled up next to me (back corner of the parking lot... was like ytf is someone parking all the way out here??) ... was the first time I'd seen a tesla in person. 

anyway, we got into conversation about he, he showed me the entire car. was a retired electrical engineer-turned-professor-turned-retiree.  we got into convo about the batteries, the electrical system... on down the line. his super cool (again, 95 years old!) mother just sat in the car playing with the super-monitor and chillaxin' while we shot the shit.. ...we must've been there for an hour. maybe longer honestly.

one of the things he pulled up on the screen was a pic he took while he was touring the factory. it was of the battery rails under the car.  one of the engineers there was working on a way to fast-swap modular battery packs.  so, like, you'd go to one side of the car, push the button, the battery bank would lower from underneath the car, you'd 'kick' this little button, and out would slide this 40lb battery pack... ...inside it would in turn be smaller battery packs, each with 4 AA batteries in it.  the 4-pack of AA's acting as a singular battery, then each of these independently connected to the charge controller... so, if any errors were going on, you'd only need to diagnose 4 batteries at a time...    anyway... the idea being that these 'rails' were half the width of the car-long (like 3ft)... two of these 4-AA packs wide, with 4 batteries in them.  and, you'd slide one out, slide in another.  and you had like 10 of these per side of the car... but, that these, in turn, would be inside a 'quad' ... or, 4 or 5 'rails' in a singular larger 'pack' and you'd pull up to a charger station, out would come the attendant, he'd roll out some dolly type thing, slide out a 'quad' and stack it... roll them over to the charger station at the 'gas station' ... roll over a new one that's all charged up, and one by one slide these in.  the entire thing taking like 5-10 min... 

the cells you'd 'dropped off' were all individually serial numbered, the packs they were in were 'tested' 'monitored' and kept with the Tesla database... and basically you 'leased energy' .... constantly swapping cells.   the 'dealership/charging station' would monitor the cells, take out the old/bad ones, swap in new ones, and manage the whole thing itself.  but, again, 'swappable batteries' and like a 10 minute battery swap.  you'd pay in accordance to the mileage age wear   tear on the batteries but... kinda like cell phone plan where you got x-minutes a month (miles) and then paid a preset amount if you went over.  the whole thing was a concept, but what the guy was working on from *there* was (this being 'the guy' that worked at the Tesla factory that the electrical engineer that owned the tesla was talking to). ....  the battery tech's job was to try to figure out how to make the 4 pack of individual AA cells (or AA-sized cells, but he was working to make them actual AA's so that the market would be even wider that tesla would be able to work with... ...ie, even more generic than specialty sized cells) ... so that... not so much that each individual battery was wired individually... but that they could have a pretty good idea inside each battery pack *which* of the 4 cells was giving them the most problems.   and/or, how to wire room into the 'backs' so that each cell could be quickly tested independent of the other 3 in the pack... 

anyway, i'm rambling and totally off subject.

but, the EE   I were on about this for a while. it was really funny. fun too! I was --| |--- that close to getting him to let me drive the car... if his mom hadn't been there he'd've easily let me.  or at least taken me for a ride but, that'd've pretty quickly turned into letting me drive it.  but, yeah. those things are fantastically simple as well fantastically bad ass. and, the power is insane.  we have a couple of 'rich guys' that live here that ... well, we have a lot actually but, 'toy guys' that get like GT2's and lambos and ferraris, maseratis etc... and they get together like once a month at this one bar.. hang out...  ...in the nicer days its after a day at the track... anyway, they all race and try to one up one another... on car, on style, etc... ... kinda like that jag, one of them would buy that jag and may not have the 'fastest' car but would have the best looking.. or another would have the fastest... etc .... anyway... he said he's 'raced' them off the line a few times... ...and he wins every time.  and, the way he wins is so much 'everyday smooth' vs loudy, gaudy, noisy, obnoxious.  again, grey haired 75 year old bowtie wearing (probably single?) guy that (probably) lives with his 95 year old mother driving a nice classy car that really looks like most others on the road honestly (a Kia or Buick or something is what I often confuse them as at first glance) ... kicking the shit out of these other guys who've dropped hundreds of thousands on their cars over the years. just cracks me up.

anyway, the main thing with the trailer is that it would be designed to be easy to set up, easy to hook up, fast to plug in, and just move on with life.  could even make like a 'range extender' type... maybe not powerful enough to power the car entirely, but gives a boost from, say, 250 miles to 400 or something... then you can just fill it up and get a bit more juice w/out having to wait for a complete charge up to go the last 100 miles you need to go to get to your 500 mile away destination.

but, again, a single cable. power, data, system integrated... and, quite. like, car engine quiet... not like a loud obnoxious construction-site generator obnoxious. 

but, i think the 'rentable' aspect of this is just as much the real key to it as the ability to buy one. just use the app the auto-manufacturer has, it auto has city-state-location.. or gives you the option to change them if you want... lets you schedule a rent date, time, length, etc ... it (they, the app/manufacturer) organize all the local places that have the trailers.. be it a dealership, an enterprise, wherever) .. gives you a code... you pull up 24/7, enter the, say, 10 digit code, or use the NFC chip in the phone or something to connect with it...  the trailer unlocks, you get to hook it up... drive away. the TOS license/insurance agreement are all arranged through the app.   when you drop it off, same deal.  no people, no paperwork (outside of the initial sign up at the dealership when you buy the car) ... you're in the program, rent the trailer, move on with life.  you get billed ... on your monthly car payment deal.   ...also all viewable via the app ... so you can get breakdowns of the bill and such.

would make life 10x easier, faster, and.. ....completely relieve range anxiety as... ...you'd be at most a gas station away.   hell, make a trailer-type that's a giant battery bank if you want... vs a gas/diesel/cng -powered engine.  but, it'd take longer to charge and prob wouldn't last as long.  batteries have a lot lower [energy density](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Energy_densities_of_common_energy_storage_materials) than hydrocarbons ... you should check out /r/energystorage ... it's a little sub/r I created a year or two ago to 'dump' energy storage related articles and such I run across.  ... just keeping up with what goes on in those fields. 

I like ev's. a lot. I don't like range anxiety. I like diesels. a lot. esp vw's diesel efficiencies. for vw to slap an engine-type that's as efficient as their tdi's in a trailer like this that accompanies some ev they make... (it'd be even higher fuel economy than 70mpg that I was getting with the '09 jetta tdi because of the lack of variability in the power demands.. prob like 100mpg? hell, higher than that probably! .. granted some would be lost through the conversion, but how much really esp at those short lengths? ie, trailertocar... 10ft? 15ft of cable? 25ft tops?) .... .... um... best of both worlds. packaged loans and/or rental deals. matching colors (potentially). etc. super convenient and much more environmentally friendly than even a clean diesel. alright, i'm done. i've repeated myself like 50x at this point.

edit: oh, i remember now what I forgot to add! Audi   HTC have Tony Stark/ironman/RDJ ... get them to make a deal such that the app that controls it all is android/HTC friendly.  if it's a 'universal trailer'... like, i can use the vw trailer with a ford of this design.. or, vice versus, you get basic standard features.. ...but, if it's an HTC-Audi/VW trailer with an Audi/VW car? make them super-integrated.    kinda like offering the basic b.s. if you just hook 'em up... but, if they're 'matching', you get extra access to their 'special features' that gives the on screen information a LOT more ... well, info, tweakability, etc.   just for the shits of it. but, an HTC+VW/Audi joint campaign like that? I think would be pretty freakin' bad ass 




 silly string today, pepper spray tomorrow, tear gas on wednesday, chemical weapons on thursday, and biological weapons on friday. 

things are developing quite nicely in the [toy-drone](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105629/) end towards their ability to be weaponized 




 I don't disagree. and, I'm of the opinion that it *should* be used ... ...with a court order signed by a judge, and a lot of accountability to the process in such that it's very well documented who's using it, why, when, how, for what purposes, using which court order signed by which judge for which specific case or investigation.
 




  I would definitely need a gas car to drive to my parents place

still don't understand why pure-electric manufacturers don't make a petro-fueled generator-trailer...  make it look like the car, same color, uses the same key to unlock it, etc.  hook it up to the hitch, plug it into the electrical system (power, data, etc) .... fill it up with fuel... drive.

the engine/generator would be designed to do one thing.... at one single power-rating: provide electricity.    no variability, no 'ups   downs' in power output to match driving-type.  it literally is designed to do one (maybe two) speeds: 1) provide electricity to charge batteries 2) provide a bit more juice to charge batteries *while* adjusting to the average demand of that. specific. trip. up to that point.

if the batteries get above, say, 10-15 miles of juice left. it turns off.  if they dip below 10 miles of juice left, the engine turns on and provides power until the batteries are both fully charged, and the power-demand is met.

not much different than, say, a phone.  ie, like a G3 :) or, even better, my M8.  plugged in, it both powers the phone   charges the battery. once the battery is full, the charge-controller switches to battery until it drops to, say, 95%, then it powers the phone and charges the battery again.

say you get to where you're going (your 500km away destination). you back it up in a back parking spot at your hotel, your parents house, the local dealership for your car, 'rest area', 'charging station' wherever 'deals' have been made to allow for parking generators (maybe for a small fee if an independent ... like a gas station, rest area, commercial/retail-location parking lot, wherever... ... or, if a dealership, hotel, whatever, park for free.

disconnect it, lock it up (just like you would a car), leave it for the duration of your 'local trip'. drive around trailer-less

or, better, make them 'rentable' *from* the local dealership, enterprise, whatever place chooses to rent 'range extender trailer-generators'.  ...hell, if you rent one from, say, Enterprise? get to park it *at* the local Enterprise while you're at your trip's destination... either paying a reduced 'holding fee' for your trip... or, if there long enough or motivatd enough, returning it to them only to pick up another one at a pre-scheduled time a week later after your trip... ..only to drop *that* one off at your local enterprise location once you return home.

just a 'thing' that's 'bugged me' for a few years now about range anxiety and ev's.  but, to (continue to) elaborate on it a bit: the size of the engine-trailer towed would be relative to the size of the car. make all cars you want to have this option be upgraded to handle it.   in such: the trailer is being trailed, not a part of the weight of the car itself... so, no need for suspension of the car to be upgraded to handle the added weight.  the brakes would need to be strong enough to handle it, but if you combine regenerative braking with slightly increased rotors   pads... it'd adjust around this ~1000lbs in added weight.

the generator *can* have a few speeds... an 'idle' of course, thouhg this would be used rarely as the engine would be more designed to just 'turn on/turn off' at predetermined power-demand points communicated from the car *to* the trailer.   then a different speed based on demand.... with a 'full' speed being strong enough to power the car at '100% electrical demand' as *well* have 'excess power' to charge the batteries at a 'realistic rate'.   

the entire thing has a data cable designed to hook into the car's onboard computer in such that the indash interface (or phone or other app) can control it 

need to get gas? simply pull over and.. fill the generator up with gas/diesel.  The power fluctuations are minimal. no 'stop   go' b.s.  very controlled, very predictable power curves. designed for efficiency, *not* performance (you're pulling a trailer after all, it's *not* like you're taking 90 degree turns at lightening speeds or trying to go 0-60 like none other)

the smaller the car? the smaller the trailer'd need to be... so, it scales up   down with the car size.   again, best if made by the manufacturer for that specific model... ie, model-specific, and even cooler if designed to look like a part of the car (same color, same key, etc... ...if purchased, *not* rented, of course) .. ...

stealing one? would be the same as stealing a car and/or a trailer. thus, fines, potential prison time, etc.    either way, would definitely 'hybridize' things, as well provide a solution to range anxiety ... while *also* reducing the amount of time an electric has to pull over to 'refill' their energy requirements (gas pumps a *lot* faster than even 960v supercharger charging stations, if such high voltage fast-charge stations even exist... I *think* Finland or Norway or somewhere was talking about doing 720v or even 840v stations, but I can't find a link)

I really like ev's though. TONS of power and almost immediately.

I also like the idea (again, being an Audi/quattro fan) of independently powered tires.... Teslas X has dual engines, with a more traditional mechanical system to control power output per tire... per axle....  ...I forget why Musk said he went with a dual-engine (front/back) with the Model X vs 4 independent engines per tire... has something to do with weight/efficiency ... but, the idea that you can power an individual tire with an independent engine and, thus, control on a microsecond level the power output per tire... traction, turning, etc... ...

as *well* the fact that the power from the electric motor *to* the tire is almost immediate... no (significant) build up in power needed... vs a gas engine... ...instant full-power torque *and* the handling to match.

the weight can be centered differently as well such as to balance the car side to side / front to back axises, as well it can have a really low-to-the-ground weight deal... so the car (truck, suv, sav, hybrid design, whatever) *isn't* top-heavy....  fast! fun! efficient!

 I'm incredibly excited for the future of the car

me too! esp since much of the tech seemingly overlaps with that of phones.

I'm sure the OP is getting a bit annoyed with our car talk on his G3 self-post. so I'm gonna chime out of this but... that last quote is definitely a shared sentiment :) 




 From [this article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/markpmills/2015/03/12/oil-glut-more-surprises-in-store-after-the-u-s-storage-shortage-plays-out/) it reads like they're likely to *continue* to 'trend lower' ... for a *while* 




 more 'history' than 'weapons' but...  




 read my other comments on this. you're associating one thing with another, incorrectly, and lumping them into the same category.

again, there's a difference between having just a database of what would've been publicly available information (at the time) anyway, and tracking your whereabouts without your permission 




 I think the key word being ['against'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc) you in a court of law...  but, it's still public information. and lots of stats could be pulled from it. from an urban planning perspective, it makes a lot of sense 




  that 'shake' would probably annoy me too

it's just from how the power is communicated, but, *for* it to be communicated that way... is sloppy design, imo. they could've adjusted the computer to compensate.  hell, prob still can/will with an update.

 TDI Jetta

my ex had one. probably still does. great car. had the torque of the diesel on the low end, then had the turbo that'd kick in around 1800rpm... so on both levels (off the line, or passing) you could get power almost instantly.   was great for overtaking cars on the interstate (or slower speeds) because they'd never expect that it could pick up that quickly.

That I drove that thing around for a few years while dating her... and, with *both* of us in the car, *regularly* got 65mpg ... and, not over the trip, but over an entire tank.  on individual trips (even trips that were 15-50 miles) we would quite often get 70+ mpg.

and, that was with*out* low rolling resistance tires and a few other 'tweaks'.    granted, this was on the '08-'10 model. they changed it in '11-and-on .... long story there and it still pisses me off, but, needless to say, the newer tdi's don't get the same fuel economy that that year-range did.

what you were saying about your friends not being in the best condition: that's part of the 'problem' with diesels, the engines often well outlast the rest of the car.... *esp* in the case of Jettas.  the window button or volume knob, or some other stupid thing is more likely to break than the engine.  the door start to pop off the frame or the .... the countless tiny little things that go wrong in cars as they age ... ...and, that *aren't* easily, likely, or inexpensively replaced. ...and, even if they are, they look odd.

ha!  like how you differentiated the DI from the T :)

 A3 diesel

I believe [they do actually](http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2016-audi-a3-tdi-sportback-photos-and-info-news)... but it looks big! I mean, i guess it isn't Q5 big... competes more with a tiguan .. prob the same frame? 

but, again, the fuel economy. it's just small... 2.0L 150hp?  I don't even see why they'd build it. I'm glad Audi's going over to diesel... didn't realize until looking at that article that they had so many models with a diesel option (A6, A7, A8, Q5, Q7 ... A3)  .... would *really* like to see them including the fuel efficiency tech VW does.  I highly doubt (obviously I could look this up but i'm being lazy) that the Q5 or Q7 tdi gets the same fuel economy that the tdi touareg does.   it's really freakin' nice not having to fill a car up every week. Getting 700+ miles per tank is just awesome.

kinda brings me back to the Tesla thing... the idea of plugging in and *not* having to go to a gas station... ...is one of the reasons I've often found myself wanting a n.gas powered Honda with the at home [PHIL station](http://www.cngnow.com/vehicles/refueling/Pages/refueling-at-home.aspx) ...   what I'd *really* like to see is a vw fuel economy-style TDI coupled with a plug-in hybrid. to have ~250 miles of fuel + batteries (ie, smaller fuel tank with space shifted to batteries) .... would be awesome, imo. 

but, Tesla. As much as I like that touareg, I've got my eyes set on the Model X :)

but, yeah, my neighbor has a barn with like 25 cars in it.  some are much more bad ass than others, ... he kinda goes about it the 'wrong' way imo. I've talked to him about adjusting it but he's not the sharpest tool in the tool box. his money, who am I to judge. but... yeah. I really see multiple cars as pretty much the way to go. I've had 4 at one time, personally, and... once you get the redundancy of b.s. taken care of (keys, garage door openers, random little shit that you have in one car and don't realize you need until you realize you *don't* have it in the other car!) ... it's bad ass.  esp if one has fuel and the other doesn't :)  ....again, going to gas stations to fill up irks the ever living shit out of me for some reason. This entire process seems so... .... 'socially humbling' at this point. Imagine all the 'plug-in' 'snobs' who just drive by gas stations and laugh as they 'remember' :)


that jat's sexy. it's sexy now. it'll be sexy in 50 years (just like [this one](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Jaguar-E-Type-1967-jaguar-xke-series-1-roadster-fully-restored-numbers-matching-/251879735425?forcerrptr=true hash=item3aa533c081 item=251879735425 pt=US_Cars_Trucks) .... sexier even, honestly, and obviously a better drive. not to say that that car *isn't* sexy, classy as fuck, and would be a blast to drive... but, the two *hardly* compare in tech-available).... ....and, probably, like that one, a few hundred grand! (*not* adjusting for inflation!) 

but, yeah, give it 2-5 years for the price curve to adjust, buy one, park it like Cameron's dad in Ferris Bueler, say '[f' the kids](https://sheofferedthemchrist.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/bd931-cameronsdadscar.jpg), they'll get over their fucking issues... and I'll pay for the therapy to help them do so with the profits from the sale of the car ... if it ever happens'  ;)

the point with the atom is just to say you can get one helluv an awesome driving car for a lot less (if you go used) ... saving the other for... well... i don't know.  those lotus' are pretty freakin' awesome cars! fun too! from what I hear 




 and that's what the jews said about the romans relative to *their* databases   record keeping as well.... and I'm sure the same was said about the Egyptians before them.

There isn't anything inherently wrong about keeping databases and making records. That people always jump to nefarious SS-like purposes is ridiculous. There's a big difference between keeping records and abusing those records.  ...and, *not* keeping records has never stopped anyone from being an asshole and abusing their position of power .   ...sure it may make it a bit easier and a bit more systematic, as well allow for a larger scale up to happen on a faster level but... 

well, again, it's the intent. not the existence-of. that this society has become so 'Nazi-label-happy' is beyond old... *and* cliche at this point 




 yeah, actually.

what's the difference between a cop sitting on the corner of main   x street for a few hours watching cars go by and taking note of the same car having gone by a dozen times  and an automated system doing it?

it's a public space. It's not like they're putting an app on your phone with location data and following you around and recording the data w/out your permission.. ....it's a public area.  two old dudes in a rocking chair and a pen   pad could do the same thing 

I'm not proposing the data be openly available to the public upon request or some .gov accessible license plate searchable database so that the pissed off guy who got cut off earlier can track the daily habits of the car that cut them off... ....nor am I even saying that officer traffic cop or detective snoop can do it... .... w/out access to a court order *allowing* for the specific search.. be it for a singular license plate, or pattern recognition post a bombing or other terrorist attack.   ....or, hell, in the case of a stalking or restraining order violation, but, again, with a court order from a judge on a monitored database with accurate logs kept of what was searched for, by whom, when, and under which court order signed by which judge for which case number.

again, it's already public information: people driving around on public streets *is* public information. keeping a database of that isn't such an outlandish thing.  




 x-post: /r/transhumanism 




 did that actually make any sense?? I know it definitely wasn't something the average 5 year old would understand 




 bah. There's a big difference between the NSA spying on citizens w/out them knowing and an atm, cop, or other camera source recording what goes on on public roads and keeping a record of random license plates driving by.

it's only when someone starts doing something with the data that it becomes 'police state'-like ... just keeping it on record somewhere to then be pulled up by a warrant isn't really the same thing, imo.

It's probably being done *any*way, why not just make it 'public-enough' knowledge that the records *are* stored... and accessible with a court order for crime solving?  




 did an edit to that comment to include links to products *I* recommend.   you may try external application of iodine as well... you don't want to take iodine tincture internally, but for topical application it works great.  try [this stuff](http://www.walmart.com/ip/17325269?wmlspartner=wlpa adid=22222222227014441176 wl0= wl1=g wl2=c wl3=40754235632 wl4= wl5=pla wl6=78606870512 veh=sem), it's cheap and it won't stain your toes because its 'white' iodine.  (it still stains a little, so be careful with woodwork and the such but, overall, it doesn't stain like normal iodine... both normal tincture *and* the lugol's linked to in the other comment).

ointments, gels, all of that? won't make it under the nailbed. Hell, even the external iodine application won't... but it'll fight it back one helluva lot... ...and, the Lugol's will come out from inside the skin as it builds up.

taking iodine isn't something you just 'start doing'... ...you need to follow loading protocols, but once you've gotten over the initial 'hump' of loading, you can take as much of it as you want and your body will simply urinate it out  ... ....until your body 'learns' how to handle it though, you need to start low   slow. like, 1 drop a day low. for a month. seriously. like, that low.

but, then increase by about 1dpd per week until you're at whatever dose you feel you need to be. 

at that, your body will push the fungus out of the internal parts... so it'll only be what's on the skin surface... and under the nail, unfortunately... but, soak it in the tincture for a while too and it'll eventually make its way under and.. ...from there, kill the fungus back in no time.

if it were somewhere easier, like... say... ringworm on your arm or something? you'd probably kill it back in a week with iodine tincture. but, under the nail sucks ass. I haven't had it personally, but I've friends   family who have, as well read *plenty* about it.

but, in that, i've read enough to know that iodine's the way to go. anything else is just a waste of time, energy, and money.

no, that's not true actually. to save some money, you can take foot baths in hydrogen peroxide.   it isn't as effective as iodine, and you wouldn't want to take a foot bath in iodine (anyway, let alone for the cost of it!) but... with H2O2 you coulud afford to fill the entire bath with it (~$1 for 32oz bottle of H2O2... vs $4 for 2oz iodine bottle) ... and it'll help to kill off the surface shit.  H2O2's a bit of a larger molecule than singular-atom iodine, so it won't penetrate as deeply into the nailbed, but, it's cheaper and... easier probably. 

should help to keep it contained and fight it back a bit.. ...while the iodine fights it back more. 

 




 I like the A3, a lot actually. I'm not entirely sure that'd be the route I'd go if I were going for a smaller hatchback though.  I'm a big fan of the Audi/VW diesels.

The TDi's get great gas mileage. I'd prob shoot for a tdi jetta wagon over an A3. I know that sounds crazy but the mpg almost makes it worth it.  I mean, at that level, you're not really going for a 'performance vehicle' as much as practicality.

I had a friend that had the A6 Allroad back in the day. was a bad.ass.car! really really fun to drive!

Honestly, what I'm looking hard at are the new diesel touaregs. I have an '04 then an '05 (flipped the '04 driving it in a back road much like the video of the jag... ...really weird circumstances. kinda the single problem with where... well, in the video, how i said an awd would compensate...

... granted VW used the 4-motion and *not* the quattro design on the '04 touareg but.... when they get two wheels off the ground (like, you're tipping the vehicle) the tires will actually spin to build up momentum... a 'gravity' so to speak in *order* to bring the car back to the ground.

I 'knew' what I was doing around this turn... and, in a 2wd I'd've managed it, or even a less-smart AWD but... I was going around this turn at around 60mph (hairpin turn) and was raising this 6800lb car off its right tires... (seriously.. was really f'in fun though!) ... anyway, the tires built up momentum to bring the car back down... ...but, I was doing that *any*way... again, I knew what i was doing! ;)

anyway, when i was letting off the wheel to start to straighten out, thus, lowering the car back down (ie, where that 'shake' in the wheel of the Jag would drive me apeshit!) .... the chip had *just* shifted power to the outside wheel to do this 'gravity spin' thing.... and, at that exact moment, the torque in them was just starting to build up. 

the moment the tires hit the ground the entire right side of the car (ie, the outside tires) hit the ground, grabbed the road as they got traction and totally jerked the wheel really hard left.. went off the road *to* the left, off a sort of 'cliff' that was about 8ft tall through a few trees, down the hill, and slammed into this big fucking tree that knocked the car to the right... thus, flipping it over.   

I 'came to' with my head down in the floorboard of the passenger side, my feet at the driverside headrest ... and had to climb out the sunroof. 

was fucking hilariously fun! like, really really f'in fun. Lucky as hell I live, let a*lone* walked away... had a mild concussion (probably) but otherwise was fine!

fucking car is a tank. seriously. The touareg, the Q5, Cayenne, etc.  that touareg had the same frame as the cayenne, same air suspension, and same transmission... ....the engine was the 4.2L V8 Audi was using at the time, and the off road controls were, again, VW's 4-Motion.   ....designed more for offroad than performance driving but... I drove the shit out of that car.

luckily my insurance had 1) accident forgiveness and 2) full vehicle replacement.  ended up not only getting a *better* equipped '05, but also pocketed $5k off the deal because the dollar/euro ratio at the time.   

granted I totaled the next one too, but that's only because the idiot drunk pulled out in front of me... at 40mph and he did a u-turn right in front of me, across my lane... at about 10ft.  was in a 4-runner. completely ripped his car to shit. like, tore both driver-side wheels off their axel.. literally, snapped the axle on both tires. absolutely tore into the car... it was a crushed can by the time we pulled them apart.

but, the t-reg was.... well, totaled. but, me? i was fine! fucking car is a life saver. literally a fast driving tank

the TDi's of those years was unbelievably powerful. ridiculous torque. not as fun to drive but that wasn't it's m.o.   towing was.

the new tdi's in them get something like 750 miles per ~21gal tank.  and also have a lot of power.  really like those cars. thinking about getting one.
the interior isn't 'Audi' but it all but is. they have a really high-quality finish, imo.  not like a standard vw.  not that that's bad, but a vw isn't an audi on the controls (ie, 'sense' :)   but... neither would a TDi wagon be an A3. 

I can't remember if they make the A3 in diesel... but even if they do, Audi only *incorporates* some of vw's diesel tech, doesn't straight use it.  ... unfortunately, as VW has the best diesels out there, imo.

I have *no* doubt that jag would be a fucking *blast* to drive! seriously... the v6 in the vid *and* the v8! ... i'm just not sure it'd be where I'd throw $75k.

there're other cars I'd rather have for that much cash... ...hell, maybe even spread it across *two* cars.  I've always wanted an Ariel Atom! :)   obv not anything *near* the same... but, I think the Jag is built as much for sex appeal as it is driving performance. 

for what it's worth? It's probably perfect.. ...but, I'd prefer a used one in a few years that to throw down that much for a new one.   




 Start taking [diatomaceous earth](http://www.amazon.com/Diatomaceous-Earth-Food-Grade-10/dp/B00025H2PY)   [Lugol's iodine](http://www.amazon.com/J-CROWS%C2%AE-Lugols-Solution-Iodine-2oz/dp/B001AEFM9Y/ref=sr_1_2?s=hpc ie=UTF8 qid=1426498154 sr=1-2 keywords=j+crow%27s+lugol%27s+iodine+solution+2+oz). $35 for a year supply of both off Amazon and the toes (and a whole lotta other things!) will clear up and not be a problem again. 




 Like the education you get when your 5lb drone gets destroyed by a milit-ton aircraft :) 




 sometimes 'common sense' needs to be 'programmed' into the laws, unfortunately. but, I hear ya 




 I never owned a BB so I really can't say anything one way or another about it.

If I were in the market for a car like that... I'm not sure the Jag'd be the route I'd go.  Not that it isn't an absolutely gorgeous car... they've *clearly* done an excellent job. sexy as fuck. seriously.  but... $65k's... a lot of money.  The guy in the vid says he'd buy it over a porsche 911, even admitting that that's 'a big admission'... I'd have to drive both.

I'd prefer a Tesla. seems faster and doesn't make that raspy 'kerplunk-plunk' sound that was getting on my nerves every time it happened.

Also, notice how around the middle of the video when he's at that point where he's not just going into the steepest part of the turn, but also beginning to come back out of it... it happens twice, maybe 3x... ...the ~2m35s mark (start at 2m28s) ... you can see the vibrations in the steering wheel, him fighting it as the traction of the car adjusts around the turn.

not only would that annoying the everliving shit out of me, you also wouldn't get that in a Porsche or Audi... the awd would adjust around it, compensating the traction to match the angle of the turn.  the Tesla would do this too.   

not sure why they'd *not* adjust around this when designing the car. it'd bug the shit out of me.   again, sexy ass car, clearly fast, handles well from best I can tell... but, again, for $65-70k, not the one I'd go for.

edit: [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Jaguar-XK-E-Roadster-1966-jaguar-xke-roadster-matching-s-blue-tan-soft-top-4-2-l-motor-w-tripple-su-/221713020966?forcerrptr=true hash=item339f203826 item=221713020966 pt=US_Cars_Trucks) I'd rather have that :)  (there are others on ebay that I'd prefer even more, but... they're 2-3x the price!  but, old jags are sexy. as. fuck!  but, when it comes to driving performance, they still don't take the cake. it's still too much of an 'image thing' over a 'driving thing' ...and, I like sexy, but it takes a second or third slot to function. she may look great, but if she doesn't 'put out right', fuck 'er, I'll find me another that will :)

 




 I really have nothing to add because I agree with all of it.

my only wonder is: what if they put radar into drones in such that the drone could detect an oncoming 'something' and be auto-programmed to 'take action' (which would basically mean turn off the engines and drop as quickly as possible ... turning engines back on once the 'minimal safe distance' is achieved and/or the ground is right there)

again,with everything else you've written... totally agree. nothing to add.
