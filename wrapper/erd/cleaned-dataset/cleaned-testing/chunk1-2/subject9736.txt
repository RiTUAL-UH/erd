 It's how the North Koreans do it! 




 Meet the new bugs, same as (or worse than) the old bugs. 




 What a mess. It's almost as if EA/Maxis is actually a bugged out specialization building in the game itself, and you just want to demolish it and rebuild again to fix it. Or at least unleash a disaster on them. 




 So we'll have to wait until they fix the new bugs introduced from their attempt to fix the old bugs? Definitely gonna take a break from the game to wait for more fixes ... hopefully the wait won't be indefinite! Sigh ... 
























 Looks great! Good to see cities that aren't just grids full of high density low wealth apartment blocks, and then tons of processor/electronics factories (ie. like most of my cities).

As for what you were thinking? Were you hungry for pretzels at the time perchance? 




 I think that's what's happening to one of my cities - 17k low wealth visiting shoppers, and I only have like 5000 low wealth goods for sale (although the number of unsatisfied sims isn't that high actually) 




 Okay, I see it. Should be fixed now, thanks! 




 Most of it was done on a boring Friday afternoon while working (and then a bit after work), and have been slowly adding stuff to it since.

Not too hard if you have Wordpress and access to a good theme.
