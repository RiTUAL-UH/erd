 Usually teams would do sales to get rid of their old stocks.

McLaren has the best value for monies currently due to lowest needed for free worldwide shipping

Notes: 

 Williams online shop are still closed

 Marussia don't seem to have one

 Lotus don't seem to care that 2013 was last year

 Red Bull/Toro Rosso's "sale" is not really cheap, especially if you want the free shipping

 No sales for Force India nor Ferrari

 Merc price is quite good, but no free shipping

 It's cheap to use RM to buy in the Caterham shop, but sadly their paypal account won't accept RM for some reason. I had to contact their sales to get my payment through 



















 Got F1 2013 during 75% sale. I am more used to the gMotor2 engine, so this one feels a bit weird

1 - How do I lessen tyre wear? In career mode at China, I noticed that my tyres were wearing out faster than other cars, even tho I was using throttle modulation to make sure there is not tyre spin out of the corners

2 - Why does the car feels like it's understeering? At Spa I am loosing time entering Bruxelles and Pouhon waitng for the front end to grip, even when the AI can just accelerate out from there.

3 - Any wheel setting guide? There is not much feel when the tyre is losing grip

4 - Is it normal that the AI are different from each track? I was winning around 40s at Melbourne and Sepang, but Hamilton was right at my tail in Shanghai no matter what I do or how much I push

 I collected F1 Racing Magazine since 2007. But some were lost as I move a lot. One of the issue that I lost was the October 2008 issue where it had the Italian Grand Prix highlights by Maurice Hamilton. In it Maurice explained how Toro Rosso had been much more clever with the brake choice (choosing a brake that heats up faster in the rain), and if not for Bourdais's stall at the grid could have easily won 1-2 



















 2014 is an interesting time. New rules, and except for Mercedes, other teams are still struggling to understand how all it works. In this time of chaos, many ideas are thrown around trying to find something to "Spice up" the race again. One of this was "raise the fuel limit so they can go flat out from start to finish"

Now this might seem logical at first glance. This season, cars are limited to only 100Kg of fuel (or ~140litres, depending on density). This means that teams are forced to save fuel and can't push as hard as they like. More fuel = less saving = faster racing right?

But what if I said that idea is not accurate? Remember the fuel limit? It's kind of helpful that the FIA uses "100Kg" as it shows that the fuel is actually quite heavy. C'mon, try dragging 100Kg around and tell me it's not heavy. And if you were in any physics classes during your school days, you know that weight does influence things.

First, let us refresh back on what extra weight can do to a race car. Extra weight means that you will have a higher lap time. Also tyre wear would be higher due to the grip needed to fight the momentum of the cars in during cornering. Another thing is braking point is also extended, due to momentum of a heavier car.

There is also the repercussion of driving flat out all the time. It induces unneeded wear on the parts of the car, and also puts strains on the drivers as well. Tyres wears out faster as well due to overheating.

Now let's imagine a race, where one car is given a 200Kg limit and another is given a 100Kg limit. During practice, the car with the 100Kg limit could lap an average 0.4 per lap faster than the one with the 200Kg limit. Just 0.4 per lap. Not much faster. They entered a 50 lap race. The 200Kg limit car is pushing all out, while the 100Kg car is saving fuel. 

Since the 100Kg car is saving fuel, the lap times is now actually similar. There 200Kg car is pushing and pushing. But wait, by lap 12 the 200Kg car needs to pit since the tyre is now toast. The 100Kg car meanwhile eaked out to lap 18 before pitting. A classic case of a 3 stopper vs 2 stopper. But since the lap times are similar this actually means the 200Kg car already have a 20s disadvantage due to an extra stop it has to make

The race goes on and both cars are now lapping faster. But the 200Kg car still needs to make up that extra stop. Having nothing to loose, it keeps pushing full throttle, now lapping a tad faster than the 100Kg car

Final stint, and now sprint to the finish. The 100Kg car is now pushing more due to saving fuel at the start. But since both have now used much of their fuel, the lap times are dropping to a similar level. The 200Kg car is spewing brake dust everytime it's brakes for a corner though. Due to the heavier car, the brakes were working harder and is now nearly finished. Things does not look good in the engine side either. A decision must be made, and the pit called to the 200Kg car, asking him to slow down to save the car. 

The above example might not be accurate, but it does gives an idea that more fuel does not really mean better racing. During the days of yore, teams usually underfuel or use the minimum fuel that they can to have a lighter car that might have to save fuel at the start but could push at the end. Upping the fuel limit it worthless if the teams themselves does not even care

The only way around this in theory is to introduce back refuelling, which would mean the cars could still fuel low, but does not have the danger of running out of fuel. But this does introduce another problem. Cars that are already fast on fixed fuel like Mercedes, could end up going faster than they are.

In the end there are no easy and simple solution for better racing. It's made even harder now that armchair fans are more vocal with ideas that they have no idea about using social media. Nothing is as simple as it seems, especially in the complicated world of Formula Racing 
























 Due to the sad case of the missing flight MH370, where the majority of the passengers were Chinese, some of the Chinese citizen has taken among themselves to blame everything that has happened on the Malaysian Govt.

With Caterham lead by Tony Fernandes that has ties with MAS (Air Asia and MAS swapped some stocks) and Merc is sponsored by Petronas which always proud of it's Malaysian root,they certainly won't be too popular in China during the GP weekend 



















 For me it was an ironic thing of can't affording a console. My family never even had a NES or FAMICON or anything like that. It was after I got into secondary school (or high school in relevant countries) that I first came upon a computer, in the lab, with Starcraft on it. And a friend of mine taught me how to play it. It was not long before we joined a computer club, and spent the evening on 8 player LAN playing starcraft and need for speed. 

A few years after, while the playstation is considered affordable, I still can't afford it. Thankfully cheap Cyber Cafes were popping up, and we were then introduced to the original Half Life. It was not long before we discovered it can also do multiplayer. When Counter Strike came into the picture, consoles are long but forgotten.

So thank you console for being so expensive that I had to play the PC. It introduced me to Multiplayer and better graphics 



















 Here's something to chew about. Kevin Magnussen's top speed of 316.9KM/h at the Australian GP was a massive 6KM/h faster than last years's top speed of 310KM/h managed by JE Vergne, and at Australia where the straights are quite short, this is quite an acheivement. It also proves that the straight line speed is still there for the new car, and the only thing that is holding them down is the harder Pirelli tyres and lack of aero grip through the corners.

As the years goes on, engineers and designers should be able to claw back some of this deficit. Although how long do you guys think they can acheive 2013 lap times? For me personally I think it could be as quickly as the Japanese Grand Prix, or as late as middle of next season. But one thing's for sure, the "the cars are 3 seconds a lap slower" would be a thing of the past before long 



















 Have you ever went back to look at the old pictures that you took, and thought to yourself, "Man, I was crap back then". 

For example some of my earliest ones: 

http://i.imgur.com/ua5k3hA.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/vHae0XP.jpg

I actually cringed and wondered how on earth I thought it was good back then

 




 I was really hyped to play Titanfall, but after two days of playing, I am back to BF4. Reasons?

 Smaller maps and less players. While I have nothing against small maps, the 6 vs 6 kills me off after being used to 32 vs 32

 Less emphasize towards team play. Everybody just plays for themselves. Even on a small scale server BF4 has more tactics

 You can spend 15 minutes just waiting for someone to join in for campaign. You have someone leaving the lobby? Resets everything. 

 Multiplayer server search is also broken and unbalanced. Level 1? Let me lump you with other level 1 players, while the other side consisted of level 20++ players. 

 Also, you can stuck with six players on either Militia or IMC, and you can't send half of them to the other side. Honestly battlelog is miles better than this

 Hit detection is much worse. You can run into things that is not really there, and swear you shoot someone just to see him one shoot kill you back. And this is with low ping and feels much more worse than BF4's "netcode"

Welp, as shit as BF4 is, it's still a better game for me honestly 




 Might be my location (SE Asia) but trying to play campaign, it's like I have to wait at least 15 minutes before I can even play as the server tries to find players. And when we do find players, we have to wait 90 seconds, and as the clock counts down, someone disconnected, and the counter resets. 

Not only that, for other modes, EVERYONE is on attrition that I waited for 1 hour at the CTF mode without anybody joining. Heck, I was lumped with 4 people in IMC and we were perplexed as why not split two and send them to Militia.

Also network needs better hit detection. I was killed countless times by someone that I shot first but when I look at the killcam, I was not even moving or shooting the other guy. This is with ping lower than 20 at all servers.

 For the past two days now, randomly when I use mortar, there was no kill confirm even tho I kill someone with it. The kill does count towards your total kill in the scoreboard, but you won't get the 100 points for killing a person. All the other bonus, like Kill Streak End, Multi Kills, Squad Wipe, etc are shown, hence how I know I was killing with the mortar most of the time.  














 Ever since BF4 was updated to be able to use Mantle, I've been running the graphic overlay command to tell wether or not I am running D3D11.1 or Mantle. One of the information that the overlay tells are the Job Thread, how many threads that are being used by BF4.

Usually BF4 will use threads half the number of your CPU's core, for example, a quad core CPU will use two threads, while an 8 core CPU will use four. Mantle usually use one extra, so this means 3 and 5 respectively.

What I notice after that fucked up February patch that lead to some maps (Dawnbreaker, Locker, Metro) crashing is that I won't crash on a PC that are using more than two threads. I have three different PCs, an Intel i5 2500K, an AMD A10 7700K Kaveri, and an Intel i7 4700K. Only the i7 does not crash on DX11.1 mode, since it's an "8 core CPU", thus BF4 are running on 4 job threads. 

I will however get crashes on the i5 and the AMD A10 on DX11.1 mode which are running only 2 job threads. Using Mantle which bumps the Job Thread to 3, game runs fine without crashing.

Might be something to look into by DICE 









 While this beta test is to stress test the servers, we are also in a way testing out all the other features of the game itself. Now what do you guys feel that need to be added/changed in the full game once it comes out? Balances or fixes?

For me

- I prefer the hold to zoom for iron sight and the press once to engage feels too like... COD. I hope there is an option to turn this off (either that or I did not go through the option long enough)

- Matchmaking should be done by player rank. I hate when one side is full of level  10 while the other sides are full of 1s and 2s. I was lucky that my first few rounds were with high level players, but after that I grew frustrated quickly when I was thrown in with lower leveled players. This was worse since Respawn turned off chat in beta so I can't tell them to spawn the titan at the same time.

Other than the too COD like feel of the game, I have nothing much to complain. I do miss a game that is larger and more tactical but I am saving my views on that after the full game comes out 









 Tested on my rig, and I can confirm that this is a D3D error. Was using SLi GTX680 and keep crashing at Locker, Paracel and Dawnbreaker after the update. Changed to single card and it did not help. Changed to borderless and it did not help

Swapped to an R9 280X, and still crashed. So I changed to Mantle, and restarted the PC and now it works. I am still not amused with DICE tho. What I can surmise is that their Mantle compatibility fix is map specific, and it broke some Direct3D setting 














 The built in team balancing options for servers right now is quite basic, and once it detects that one team has a number of more players, it will take the first person that has been killed on the other side and bring it to the unbalanced side. 

This, while is logical sometimes can be infuriating, moreso in RUSH and OB. Three times in Rush, I died after arming an MCOM to see I was moved to the other side. There was an ironic moment when I died arming the last MCOM with the ticket count is less than 10, and I was moved to the other side to see my arm lead the other side to victory, while I was given a lost, even tho I was the one that armed that last MCOM.

For me, this is what I think should be done for team balancing

- No player movement should happen in RUSH once the tickets are are low enough (15 or less)
- Players who died PTFO (capping, arming a bomb or MCOM) should not be moved
- Players that has a high number of captures/MCOM arming or defending or bomb arm should be given "less priority" to be moved

Feel free to add your idea, or fix mine 


































 Remember when the time that mortar was really overpowered? Dice patched. Now mortar can't be reloaded by support pack, and surprisingly, whomever using mortar can't reload grenades. I kinda understand that logic of losing mortar would loose it for that life. but not having the ability to reload grenades as well is kinda annoying since once your mortar is dead and you are out of grenades, your options are limited to your primary and secondary weapon. There are times that I can't even help my teammate who is in a pinch since I don't have any projectile weapons anymore.

So Dice, please give back the ability to reload nades. I will do anything for you. I will even post good reviews of BF4 on youtube if you want me to 









 I am amazed not many people are asking for this to be fixed. As seen here: http://imgur.com/3bYuffE there are quite a few broken things, for one mortars stats are still not shown unless you click on it. Also some vehicles are given more service stars than they should, while in this case the mobile artillery is not given even tho I have more than 100 kills using it already  









 Usually I will get this error when the PC has been turned on for a while. At first I did as what it was said, using Task Manager to manually kill BF4.exe, but one day I realised that it was actually working, and if you wait a bit longer, the game will run as intended.

Just a heads up for anyone getting annoyed with this error 







































 As title. As it seems, there seems to be no easy way for the attackers to counter this tactic. The defenders can have two or three engy to fix the MBT and the MBT could cover any threat going down the mall 
































































 Encountered this problem when I can't join any server that is hosting China Rising map, even tho I am a premium user when I am using my laptop. Seems that Origin did not add a key in your windows registery, which is used by Battlelog to see if you have installed the DLC

1 - Open regedit

2 - Browse to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE  Software  Wow6432Node  EA Games  Battlefield 4 (64 bit) or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE  Software  EA Games  Battlefield 4 (32 bit)

3 - Add new key in Battlefield 4 named "Xpack1" 

4 - In Xpack1, add a new string, name: "Installed" value: 1


Go back to Battlelog and voila! you can now join the previously unjoinable servers 





































































 For two days after the patch, when I am playing support, I can only now use one mortar per life, and it won't reload even if I am sitting on top of my ammo box. Heck, it won't reload my nades even, so I feel it's more of a bug than a nerf. 

Ammo reload is fine for some reason 




 Sorry if anybody posted this issue, but everytime I kill using mortar, it just put there [] enemy name with the [] should have the weapon name inside it. And even when I look into my stats, my mortar kills are still 0, even tho I have killed quite a number of people with it. 

Anybody else have the same problem? 





























 Since the Recon class in BF4 has the PLD, as well as the ability to "zero" the optics, I wonder how long does it take til two recons work in tandem, with one using the PLD to gauge how far the target is, and the second one will snipe accordingly. 

This combo in theory would be faster (since only one recon is scouting, so there is not time wasted between switching from the PLD to the rifle and then adjusting the scope) and much more safer (spotter can also watch out for other threats incoming) 


































 forgot to take a pic of it but you can see the giant screen at C briefly showing BSOD before th building collapse. gives a new meaning to "computer crash" eh? 




 Usually when I join a server, it will auto give me the assault class, and even if I have changed class, if the round ends and we start a new one, I am still changed to the assault. 

How do I stop this? In BF3, the class chosen is the last one you used in the round before, which is what people usually would expect 



















 Newbie gamer here. Basically, why does game titles from Activision rarely have any price drops, if at all. I've seen many games, sometimes even new ones that were being sold, usually during "sales" or "promotion" periods for just the fraction of the original costs. I remember buying Tomb Raider (2013) during a promotion period for just 10 bucks, and yet I rarely seen Activision's game drop near this price range. Was hoping to see an at least 75% discount on the Activision sale this weekend but the most was only 50%, and even then it's only for one title per day. 

Is it because the games by Activision deserve the price that they are selling them at?  













































































































 Much more worth it. Faster, silent, and less power
 




 They are actually two similar cards. Just that the control panel gets weird sometimes

 Right click on desktop --  NVIDIA control Panel 




 Around + 50 to 70% performance gain, depending on the game and if NVIDIA has optimised the drivers for the game 




 Miles better. I barely got 40FPS on Asetto Corsa on FULL settings with the GTX680 SLi. Now I am getting 100++ FPS 




 Which card? I've use the GTX980 reference card and it had no problem 




 You can see at the bottom it's set to the 2nd card

2. Why would you put a 120Hz monitor on an inferior connection? HDMI won't have the sufficient bandwidth compared to a DVI-D 














 IIRC it's Grand Chelem 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Link_Interface

I based my explanation on this + forums and google. Usually when a new driver is announced by AMD/Nvidia, you can read in the update notes things like 

Optimised (game name here) for SLi/Crossfire

So that's how we can guess the drivers is the one handling the workload.  




 Usually the multi GPU setup is optimised by the drivers which will tell the GPU how to allocate the workload. even if the game is not optimised for multi GPU, the driver will make it work 




 The reaso  for red flag was ambulance on track i think 









 It's called panning. Focus on the subject, use low shutter speed, and burst the trigger while following the car in motion. usually 1 or 2 in 10 of your burst shots would be good enough as with the OP's shot.

 The back straight has a 45% view of the back side of the circuit. I totally recommend sitting here as it's cheaper than the front straight

Since i live in KL, the track is quite accessible by car, albeit will take a little time to reach there.  




 Win win situation for both honestly. Honda need a team to enter, and McLaren needs an engine manufacturer to back them up after loosing Mercedes monies 




 Tyres, and he was using less fuel than anybody else up to that point 




 Give him any kind of car, and he will drive it. While Alonso can be said to have a similar ability, Hamilton seems to just be able to get in the car, and just drive it, while Alonso might need more time to learn the car. 

I was impressed with Hamilton in 2009. He managed to wring that POS McLaren to places and wins that it was not supposed to have. It might be that during that time he used the car to learn how to drive on the edge, but yet save fuel and save his tyres, two thing that he was really bad at in 2008 and 2007

I still rate Alonso higher as he is the most complete package on the grid today, but I really love Hamilton as the pure racing driver 




 They are busy turning left 




 I think Crofty and Brundle were talking about what can be considered as taking an advantage, and Brundle explained that the stewards would see the sector times and their own racing experience to judge wether or not a driver gains or loses any advantage. 

Since Hamilton lost a lot of time on the first sector, he was deemed to have made a mistake and nothing more was thought of that 




 His highest was third IIRC in 2009 in the most shittiest McLaren ever. Never had much luck since. Usually incidents, and the most weird was the broken third spring that nobody realised in 2011 or 12

 In anticipation of BF3 beta, bought two HD6850 thinking it would be enough. After 2 hours, sold it back and bought two GTX570, a new motherboard, and a new casing. 




 They still do. It's just not televised 




 It's hard not to get coverage without ads. Bernie charges A LOT for F1 broadcasting, and stations usually cover this cost by selling ad slots. Sky basically could run the coverage without ads because they can cover up the losses through other channels, and even then you have ads during free practice and qualy, and this is in a country where the F1 viewers are usually high

For North America, where the F1 viewer numbers are usually less than Europe, they have no choice. They have to have the ads. But if you find them too obtrusive, I suggest emailing them and suggeting them to make a side by side window for the ads. There are a lot of other sporting events where the ads are shown at the same time with the main sport. 






















































 F1 has long been dominated by European drivers. But once in a while you would see drivers from other continents, like Australia, South America and North America making a name for themselves in the sports. One continent that has the least amount of drivers competing in the sport is Asia. Currently, only Japan's Kamui Kobayashi is representing Asia in the sport. 

Let's take a look at up and coming prospects from Asia that might one day end up with a race seat in one of the F1 teams in the future

.............................................................................................................................



**Ma Qinghua** (China) - 26 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Unknown*

**Current Drive** Citron Total WTCC (*WTCC*)

The great hope of China, Ma was the Chinese chosen driver for the ill fated A1 Grand Prix series. He has a lot of European single seater race experience under his belt, and was the test driver for HRT and Caterham. Now driving for Citroen in the WTCC series. Is the first Chinese driver to win a WTCC round when he won in Russia

**Chances:** *Slim*   


................................................................................................................................



**Takuya Izawa** (Japan) - 31 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Honda?*

**Current Drive** ART Grand Prix Team (*GP2*)

A former Formula Nippon driver for Team Aguri, Izawa made a name for himself in the Japanese touring car race series, Super GT. Made a jump to European single seater this year as a driver for the highly rated ART Grand Prix team. Has had a lackluster season, but he had his first podium finish in Hungary after Colletti was penalised. 

**Chances:** *Slim (Might end up having a test driver role when Honda joins F1)*   


................................................................................................................................



**Rio Haryanto** (Indonesia) - 21 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Pertamina*

**Current Drive** EQ8 Caterham Racing (*GP2*)

Raced in single seater series in Asia and Australia, Rio made a move to European single seater in 2010 competing in GP3. He was mightily impressive, even winning a race in Turkey, and winning two more races in 2011. Was Max Chilton's partner in GP2. Considered a fast driver, but needs more experience under his belt. He is also the first Indonesian driver to qualify for a Superlicense. 

**Chances:** *Moderate (Pertamina might buy him a seat in the future)*   


................................................................................................................................



**Kimiya Sato** (Japan) - 24 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Unknown*

**Current Drive** Campos Racing (*GP2*), Euronova Racing (*AutoGP*)

A young and upcoming driver from the land of the rising sun, Kimiya amazingly started his single seater career in the UK with the Formula BMW racing series before going back to Japan. He was the runner's up in the 2009 All Japan Formula 3 National series, before making the trip back to Europe to join the Formula 3 Euro Series. Runners up in the AutoGP championship last year, and now racing in both GP2 and AutoGP. Currently leading the AutoGP championship, but having a torrid time in GP2. 

**Chances:** *High (Honda might find him the best bet to give a racing seat to a Japanese driver)*

**Sean Gelael** (Indonesia) - 17 y/o

**Sponsors:** *KFC Indonesia*

**Current Drive** Jagonya Ayam with Carlin (*F3*)

This young driver from Indonesia made a fast rise in his career. Only started professional racing in 2011, racing in the Asian Kartin series where he finished third. Wasting no time he moved to Europe just two years later competing in Formula 3. Currently in his second year of F3. Still has yet to show his rumoured potential.  

**Chances:** *Moderate/Low (Unless he shows results in the next few years, it's doubtful that he could break into F1, especially since Carlin is one of the best racing team in single seater. Considering that his sponsors is not really a traditional name in motorsports, they are most likely not to pay for his F1 seat)*

**Jazeman Jaafar** (Malaysia) - 21 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Petronas*

**Current Drive** ISR Racing (*Formula Renault 3.5*), HTP Motorsports (*Blancpain GT Series - One off race*)

Malaysia's hope for the future, Jazeman competed in karting in both Malaysia and Europe. Was one of the few drivers given a special leeway when he wanted to join Formula BMW Asia due to his really young age. Won the championship in hist first year, he then moved to Europe, competing with Raikkonen Robertson Racing. He then moved to Carlin to drive for their Formula 3 team. Had a lackluster two years before finishing second in British F3 in 2012. He then moved to Formula Renault 3.5 for again Carlin, before he moved to ISR Racing this year. Has a couple of podium in Monaco and Spa as well as finishing 5th in the Spa 24 hour race this year with HTP Motorsports.

**Chances:** *Moderate/High (A Petronas Motorsports development talent and might be given the test seat for Mercedes due to the close relationship with Petronas Motorsports and Mercedes)*

FAQ

**What is this?**

It's a *free* streaming site that I use to stream sports from my home. I actually use it so that I can watch my own TV when I am at the office, as I usually work 10~12 hours a day 

**What will you be streaming?**

Sports, mostly football and motorsports. Priorities for Formula 1 and Arsenal, in that order.

**What is the quality of your stream?**

Due to location (I am in Asia, and I am streaming it to a Ustream server in the USA) I limit the stream to 720p, 25fps, 1.5Mbps. 

**Why Ustream and not (insert the streaming choice of my liking)**

Because it's easy, and it can be watched by everyone no matter if they are on a PC or on a mobile phone. Also they are a bit lax on DMCA takedown. And if my stream do get taken down, registering another account is really easy. Also it's the fastest non pay RTMP streaming service that I have tested

**What is the channel source?**

Malaysian cable sports channel. So you won't get the same pre/post match thing that you would expect or get from UK channels. Also be prepared for last minute changes and fuck ups. 

**Are you making any monies from this?**

I do put some google ads on the site, but I don't actually care, as the monies from the ads can barely pay the monthly fees for internet and cable tv here. Also doing this to help fellow Gooners and F1 fans

If you guys have any questions or request, go on ahead! 









 Now that the summer break is here, how would you rate the drivers up till now?

Nico Rosberg

Calm, smart, and calculating. Took his chances and took it well. It's not surprising that he is leading the championship. But if there is an achilles heel, it's that he needs all of his engineers input to make his driving faster, and IMO this is what could derail his championship run at the end of the season


Lewis Hamilton

Definately the driver to watch. He is unlucky not to be leading the championship. But honestly the two drivers from the back of the grid to the podium in Germany and Hungary was the drives of the season. For the people who disagree, I would like to remind you that he drove in Germany with brakes that he hates, and in Hungary with a rebuilt car that he have no idea how it feels. He could still pip Nico at the end of the season


Daniel Ricciardo

Revelation of the season. Calm and adapted to life in the Red Bull like duck to water. If it's not for the Mercedes total domination, he could be up there fighting for the championship. Next year he will definately be closer tho. Expect more wins to come this season yet.


Seb Vettel

The loss of the blown diffuser hits him more than any other drivers on the grid. Still not being able to adapt to the new car, nevertheless he has been calm and mature. Other than the "tough luck" moment earlier in the season, he is quite okay with his teammate being faster. Might end up finding his form again after the season resumes


Nando Alonso

Best driver in the grid in not the best car on the grid. Flatters the Ferrari more than it actually should. The second half of the season would see if he stays at Ferrari or find a better team. 


Kimi Raikkonen

Struggling. That is the only way to describe him this season. And his bad back is definately not helping. Add to Ferrari's questionable tactics and strategy he finds himself in places he should not be at in the first place. Might be his last season in F1.


Valterri Bottas

Next great Finnish hope. Finished the half season with a lot of good drives. Took his chances and shows that he is faster than his much older teammate. If Williams can find more speed in the car, then he could find himself a win in the second half of the season, especially if the Mercs trips over each other


Felipe Massa

Guy can't seem to find a break. His bad luck, especially at the start of races seems to be much more worse than Hamilton's. Struggling to keep pace with his teammate


Jenson Button

Missing Hamilton's setup input. Does not help the McLaren is shit. With the departure of Whitmarsh, his place in the team is also under threat as Ron is not really his largest fan. Might be his last season with the team, unless he can turn his season around


Kevin Magnussen

Started the season with a podium but slid back. Shows some flashes of speed. But still does not show anything special, yet.
 
























 After seeing all of these 60FPS jokes on the console peasants, I was thinking, does it really matters to everyone here personally?

Only selected races were recorded by me due to various reasons

- No race 1-3, as I had not acquired a capture card when it aird
- No race 10, as my cable provider did not air the Friday's race, and never aired a repeat of it.

All races are in 720p, 50FPS, at around 5mbps bitrate.

Enjoy 














 I mean honestly, year after year they would always amaze me. No matter what kind of rules that are thrown at them, there will be always someone, somewhere that can find a solution to the problem, and will be then copied down the grid. 

After 5 races, I can see the car can potentially be as fast as last year, and considering how much the FIA are restricting the downforce and aero, this is no mean feat. 














 It's interesting to see that everytime the fuel graphics comes out, it's Lewis Hamilton (and to some extent, the Williams) that is using the least fuel than anyone else during a race weekend.

This combined with the ability to still post competitive time is really quite amazing considering that people says he is an "all out driver". This could play into his hand later in the year if he needs some more power when push comes to shoves 



















 Tuned in to GP3, and found out the track is damp. This might change the race later today as tyre wear will worsen
