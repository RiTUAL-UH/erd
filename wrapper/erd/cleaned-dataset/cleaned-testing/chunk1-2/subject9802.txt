 If there was, I guarantee that not a single attractive man on there is actually a virgin and is there just to pick up chicks they can deflower. 




 Tech support associates see that kind of shit all the time. They'll laugh about it behind the scenes and then forget it the next day when something weirder happens. I used to work for Apple and this was a common occurrence. 




 Falafel and Shawarma. Also, Shepherd's Pie (with actual Lamb) because my ethnic heritage is Irish   Israeli. 




 I help rich old people with their travel plans... Visas, itinerary advice and my personal favorite: "is there a hair dryer in all of my hotels?" 




 Kale. All of the kale. I buy it frozen and put it in soups, stir fries, smoothies, etc... Also, garlic and spices as flavoring and I refuse to buy junk food. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but frozen grapes are a great alternative to popsicles and ice cream. 




 All in good fun ;) 




 Poutine fucking rocks. 




 I am prescribed Adderall. 




 Ha, that is pretty awesome, considering I'm a Jew. 




 Playing devil's advocate... I can understand her question, but that doesn't make the question at all okay. If she was dressed provocatively, sure, she is more at risk of harassment... Should she be harassed REGARDLESS of what she is wearing? Abso-fucking-loutely not. I would be pissed, too, but I'd see it as an opportunity to educate your girlfriend on why that kind of thinking perpetuates that kind of problem rather than just getting confrontational. 




 Tell the difference between "should of" and "should have" 




 My mother is bipolar and an alcoholic. She abused me growing up until I was 14 and reported her to my therapist. I went into the state's custody and bounced around from home to home. It was hell and I was completely fucked up from it but I became stronger as a result and after a LOT of hard work and seeking therapy/medication/help and not holding grudges or pointing fingers, I'm starting to really like who I've become. It isn't easy because I'm a very sensitive person and certain comments and events will trigger knee-jerk reactions where I can act emotionally or get angry at someones insensitivity but I think if I didn't persevere, I'd be a completely different and much sadder person...

 Winkin, Blinkin and Nod... I got a tattoo of one of the poems called "The Gingham Dog and the Calico Cat" recently because I remember reading it often as a kid and loving how dark it was for a kids poem 




 But her attitude is amazing and if she could pick herself up by the britches, why can't I when the hardest thing I have to do is work a 50 hour work week for demanding old people?

I can't stop listening to it...

Fucking double negatives... 




 I just read the IAMA thread about the woman that got mauled by a bear and I remember that life isn't that hard... 




 Cool, thanks for your feedback. I'll be sure to keep your opinion in mind next time I'm drawing with crayons at dinner.

 I did an intensive inpatient here and have been in recovery since September after 7 years of bulimia. It's definitely not easy, but this place is a godsend. Please consider going here, even if you live far away. It's one of the best chances you'll have, if you really want to get better.

I got him for $50 in a small antique shop in Texas. My friend currently has him, though, because he is a pain in the ass to move with. 




 It shouldn't if your using the right stuff! Try making a conditioning mask that you leave in your hair... Perhaps a raw honey and avocado mask left in your hair for a few hours will help. 




 I meet amazing people all the time just by being open and not intrusive.... Just the other night I met someone who I talked to for 3 hours and he told me "I'm telling you things I don't even tell my closest friends!"
I just am really open, honest and curious about people and what they do or what makes them tick, so asking about their life and being genuine has always been what works for me. 
I also draw or write whenever I sit at a bar, which usually instigates people to inquire what I'm doing and it just kind of goes from there... 




 Believe it or not, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, etc are all fruits, despite being regarded as veggies. 
Vegetables are basically lettuces, root vegetables like carrots, etc as their seeds aren't contained/protected by the fruit (save for a few examples like strawberries where the seeds are outside) 




 It's $28 for 4 fl. oz... I believe $90 is for the 16 oz.

e: It's so dense and rich that it really only requires a small amount of conditioner. I used to use it when I got it for free when I worked in body care and it made my hair feel like bunny rabbit hair. It is amazing. 




 I doubt it will affect you any differently besides psychologically... If you're worried about it when you take lsd, you're probably going to really worry about it when you're tripping which could cause you to have a bad trip 




 [This is pretty great, albeit expensive...](http://www.johnmasters.com/hr.htm)

Also, try not shampooing your hair except for once a week or less, and only using conditioner. You can rinse your hair with raw apple cider vinegar (1 tablespoon to 1 cup water) and massage it into your hair and let it sit for a few minutes, rinse with water and apply conditioner... Shampoo strips your hair of natural oils which causes your scalp to try to compensate for the lost oils and also the shampoo just dries out your hair follicles...

 My uncle died of a heart attack when I was 14. His kids were 8 and 10 and kept telling him to "wake up" 




 In French, tu is a familiar "you" and vous is a formal "you"

 You're being silly, but you also need to either relax and let him have his space or think about whether this relationship really is worth your time. Could you elaborate more on the consistency of this? 




 Tetsuo: the iron man? 




 My father was arrested in 1988 for being the leader of an Israeli cocaine ring. I think the story about his lifestyle and subsequent arrest would make an interesting story. My mom was also a model and a bipolar alcoholic and I ended up in foster care after 14 years of abuse and witnessed a lot of fucked up stuff in the system... I've always joked how cool it would be as a movie/documentary, even though growing up really sucked...

 Awww, the poor little guy! I genuinely think, while a lot of cats don't form emotional bonds to their owners in the way that people assume dogs do, cats that have gone through significant trauma and were rescued really are capable of recognizing it. I think it's cute that you gave him his tail and he tried to get cleaned up for you. You're a good cat mom!  




 What a pretty cat! Do you know her/his breed? 




 Definitely went to the vet, hahaha... That would be incredibly inhumane of me to perform surgery on my cat. 




 You may not be able to tell without looking, but the photo on the top right is him with his neck tube...

 Eight Rivers... I hope this kitty likes water! It's a really great name, though. Definitely a little bandito! 




 He will be four in february, so here's hoping he sticks around! He eats better than I do so he might outlast me! 




 He is doing very well! He was 9 pounds at his sickest and now he is a healthy 13 pounds (which for his size is appropriate). He also never meowed or made eye contact when he was at his sickest but now he is quite talkative and is a big happy goofball :) 









 You look stunning!!!!  




 That's reassuring! I am definitely impatient when it comes to seeing results, but it's good to know I don't have to do some crazy regimen either, I guess... I don't want to become obsessive with fitness.  
























 It's appreciated all the same, though proper grammar is also incredibly flattering to me! 




 I believe in the first I was 13, the second I was 15 or so? Most recent, 25.

 My really pretty what? 




 Foggy, clear Converse. That sounds awful! 




 Aw, thank you :) 




 Yep! I remember refusing to participate in swim class in high school and my gym teacher made me do laps walking around the pool. He also gave me a VHS of [My First Mister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E24SGpVrs-s) because the girl in it reminded him of me. In retrospect, it was kind of creepy that he put that much thought into it, and the title is kind of wtf. 




 Note the fanny pack in the first photo... I don't even know what to say about those earrings, either. Heh, I remember he used to joke around and wear my **scrunchies** and jokingly call himself "Tina" in order to mess with my cousin and me... How he turned out to be a *relatively normal* human being is beyond me.

He also was diagnosed with [vitiligo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo) when he was a freshman in high school. He used to get picked on a lot because he wore makeup to cover the blotches. He was able to stop the progression of it by doing radiation, I believe. By the time he graduated, he was one of the most popular kids in high school. Complete 180. 




 I thought it would never happen. I still feel like that frumpy little girl who got picked on constantly... Thank you!  




 Thank you! :) 









 I did! The fist photo you can kind of see them. Derp. 




 I did say "wannabe" 









 I think that's what makes it so fantastic. It can be kind of boring at first, but the last half makes it totally worth the wait, imho.

 Hey! You're one of the few girls that can be compared to a hippo without it actually being an insult (perhaps)...

Hippopotamus also sweat red! Their sweat is much more viscous and works as a natural sunblock. Maybe you're just more evolutionarily advanced!

 Should I be worried for having big ocular cups? It is the only cup size that's big and I hear it can be a sign of ocular degeneration. *weep* 




 DAMN IT. I fucking love Migas and NO ONE in Boston has it or knows wtf it is. I miss the food in Texas :( 




 They are thought to become extinct within the next, um, 50 years or so? Shame.... Redheads make me swooooooon 




 Man, sometimes I miss living in Austin, but damn do they have messed up politics. I miss sneaking into deep eddy at night for swims, though.

 Do either of you ever feel like, after 4 seasons, you're beating a dead horse? Ever consider moving on to a new region/theme/niche? 

Also, while I'm sure you're all incredibly appreciative of the reception you've gotten for Portlandia, do either of you regret any particular skits or aspects of the show? 
I have a ton of tattoos inspired by biology/zoology and I'm particularly fond of birds, but I am so sick of hearing "Put a bird on it." I'm curious if either of you ever have experiences like that...

I think DMT is a much more profound experience than LSD... I've never done DMT, but from what I've heard and seen in documentaries, it is WAY more spiritually heavy than LSD, which is usually just a 'fun' thing to experience while still having some profound moments.
