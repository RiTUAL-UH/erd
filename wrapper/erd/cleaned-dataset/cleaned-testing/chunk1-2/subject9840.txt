 Air conditioning. Why is it so noisy and never the right temperature?! 




 I have a laptop with a 10" screen. You can make it full screen and I can read those on the train, but I generally don't like reading off a screen if it's more than 10 pages. 

Also I hate reading off my laptop in bed. I will usually print it off or buy it cause the laptop gets hot.  




 Did you get it? 




 I've got it. I'll email it through. 




 Haha wow how do they enforce that?  




 Yeah fair enough. I was thinking more of publicly available statistics, but of course the insurance companies would record those.  




 I don't think anyone actually records those types of statistics. 

Also, I was providing statistics relevant to car insurance, so I think this is relevant for that purpose.

I am not really saying women are better drivers than men, only that they are involved in different types of accidents. 




 Some stats from my state ([link](http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadsafety/downloads/accidentstats2007.pdf)):

* 2007: "More than a quarter of all speeding drivers and motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were males aged 17-25. In contrast, only four per cent of speeding drivers and motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were females in that age group."

* 2007: "Fatigue was assessed as being involved in at least 20% of fatal crashes. Thirty-one per cent of the fatigued drivers and motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were males aged 40 years or more."

* 2006: 374 male road deaths vs 122 female road deaths 


Women and men may have the same number of accidents overall, but women may have more smaller prangs than men but fewer big accidents - so claims cost less ([link](http://www.carinsuranceexplained.com/car_insurance_explained/men_vs_women.htm)).

 




 I agree with this. As much as people pretend like they are okay with a mental illness, they can't shake their misconceptions. 

A girl where I work told some people she had suffered from severe depression and was on anti-depressants, and I heard hush hush comments from people about it, saying things about how she wasn't stable. It was not done in a nasty tone at all, in fact more of a caring tone, but I still feel she is treated differently to other people. She is very capable of doing the job she was hired to do, and I don't think this should be on people's minds when it comes to her work.

 Computer Science! 

I started out in pure science and ended up veering towards Comp Sci.

I know a lot of people who've done IT and a lot of them have ended up working at banks and consulting, but a few are doing different things. 

Downside is that I graduated in a downturn period. Was really hard to find my first job. I went back to uni and studied more and when I came out again it was great! 

I also like how what I can do can be applied to a lot of different industries. As someone with a short attention span for one particular topic, this is important to me.

What I don't like is that IT is often perceived by business as a service, because in most cases that's precisely what it is. 

I love that I am in IT, and wouldn't do anything else given the choice again now. Now it's just a matter of finding a job I like too :)

 Night and Daycare 




 That describes my organisation exactly! I am going a little bit insane here. I don't think I will hang around for much longer in all honesty, but I hope to do something good while I am here.

I like your advice, and I will keep trying to focus on constructively moving things forward. I guess sometimes I have been a little impatient, and don't always understand management's decisions. I will follow your advice though and listen to my manager and other people who have been around the organisation.

Unfortunately, most of my peers aren't much help. I have asked them and a lot of them seem to have given up on improving the organisation as it has proven to be too hard, and just focus on their technical work and the other job benefits, like the paycheck and leave. I've become rather de-motivated lately, as my peers tell me to enjoy the pay/leave benefits and not to worry about the problems of the business. At this stage in my career I am not yet prepared to do that though, and I am hoping this becomes a valuable learning experience no matter what the outcome.  




 It sounds like you have a lot of really good advice to share, so I thought I would ask a question. It's a bit detailed, but I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to deal with my managers.

I have been working at a large government organisation for 18 months and am quite junior.

Although I'm technical I can see a major problem with the organisation (it is primarily a business issue but has ramifications for IT), and I previously raised it with the 2nd in charge (sort of like COO). I regret that I didn't have a solution at the time, as he asked me what I suggest we need to do. I told him that I would need some time to think and reasearch a solution. After I explained that I may offend my managers for raising it directly with him and not my immediate manager, he said he would send an email inviting me to sit with him and with the head of IT to discuss my ideas. 

After this meeting I told my manager that the 2nd in charge would like to discuss my ideas, and he said I needed to present to him first. I saw that as a good thing as it was a chance to get some valuable feedback.

However, since then I've moved to another manager in the IT department, and this manager would also like me to present to him first, and then if he approves I can present to my senior manager. After presenting to the senior manager, if he approves then I will be able to present to the head of IT and all the other senior managers. If they are all okay with it, then I will be able to meet with the 2nd in charge to discuss my idea. 

I believe this process is going to take a few months and it is quite frustrating, as this is just an idea (and hasn't been approved by anyone yet, and is primarily a business idea), and also the 2nd in charge has asked me to go see him.

I don't know what to do in this sort of situation. I know I can go directly to the 2nd in charge and say that I am still very keen but I have been asked to present to others first before I can talk to him, but I know that will annoy a lot of people. I have spoken to my manager to explain that it wasn't really necessary to present to all senior managers first before going to the 2nd in charge as it was more of a business issue. He couldn't give me a good reason why I had to and in the end said he would talk to the head of IT to see if we can just present to him. 

I just feel that they are putting up roadblocks for me and I am not doing this for me but because I really honestly believe that the organisation will benefit from this (and I have attended senior business meetings where they have raised issues relating to this problem that affect the work). The main reason that I think they are doing it is because it will probably create more work for the IT department, but I believe that if the business thinks it is important then that is up to them to decide and not IT.

I would just like to know what you think is the right thing to do in this sort of situation?

 




 I think you need optimism when you're really young. He will be brought back down to earth in time. I don't think you could get through some of the early challenges in life without optimism. Also agree that he has a lot to learn. 

I think business education is good for helping you know how to manage or run a business but not necessarily give you the skills required to actually produce an output. If he really wants to do these ideas, he might need to learn a second skill.  




 Just got home from work, and don't want to think about anything! 




 A dwarf walks into a bar and he slips over a piece of shit on the floor, he walks off thinking nothing of it.

So the big man kills him.

 Best schools/universities: The quality depends a lot on the teachers. 

University advice: Go introduce yourself and don't be shy asking questions in class, or talking to your lecturers. Pay attention when they tell you what the assessments are/how they are graded, and start working on them early. Don't worry about what other people are doing. Don't fail a subject more than once.

Ways to save money: Don't buy shit you don't need. Food costs a lot - take your own food/snacks.

Getting a job: Just get whatever you can to begin with, then upgrade when you can. 

Can't comment on the other two.

 I'm not great at diagrams, but here's my shot at it: [http://imgur.com/INMR5.gif](http://imgur.com/INMR5.gif) 




 Check whether she usually wears gold or silver colored necklaces. Usually people have a preference for one or the other. I'm not sure what things cost there but I'm guessing 9ct Gold or white gold should be good.

If she likes stones, you can pick a stone in a particular color you think she'll like (sometimes jewellery stores arrange their pendants by the color). Otherwise you can go for something with multiple coloured stones or just a nice simple design with no stones or clear stones. You could also look at lockets if you think she'd like that.

Don't get plated jewellery. I think that stuff is a waste of money because it just wears out and then looks crap. 




 Yeah I don't know if it was because of me (my parents never made an official complaint because they thought it would make it harder for me at school) but the teacher left the school a year later. 




 At a school camp I fell into a ditch playing a game and broke my arm. I couldn't sleep because of the pain, and went to tell the teacher that I thought I'd sprained it. She told me to take a drink of water and go back to bed. I cried myself to sleep.

Then the next day a friend had a bandage so I put it on. The teacher told me to take it off because it was dirty. 

I didn't participate in archery or abseiling which is unusual for me because I love those two things, but she kept treating me like I was overreacting.

I got an x-ray 2 days later and it showed a fracture of the wrist. I got a cast and returned to school. The teacher gave me the dirtiest looks and hated me since then. 




 Haha I didn't notice that!

 Yeah that's pretty selfish lol. I mean she could even use it first and then let you use it, and if she really didn't want to use it after that, then she could throw it out and get a new one since a toothbrush is like $2. I hope she at least let you have some mouthwash. 




 Don't worry she might not like you but I love hair and bananas!!

 Their sheep string internet days are meant to be [nearly over!](http://www.digitaltasmania.org/news/14/58)

Although, they said something about Tasmanians being the first to get a [medical smartcard too back in 2004](http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/soa/Tasmania-to-get-first-taste-of-Medicare-smartcard/0,130061744,139154706,00.htm) lol. 

Recently I saw a news story about the fast Tassie internet. They were interviewing locals to see how excited they were about their improved connection speeds. There was about 2 people out on the streets in this tiny town, and they ended up interviewing an old couple who probably didn't even own a computer. 




 I'm worried that he was so specific. Is it okay for the dogs to eat a whole citizen, as long as they don't just take bits and pieces? They're not allowed to waste their food when dogs in Africa are starving? 




 I find the argument that a data mining system (and I'm specifically talking about TIA which no longer exists) produces false positives kind of poor, because correct me if I'm wrong, but false positives come up all the time in investigations. For example during a murder investigation, you would have several suspects most of which are likely to be false positives.

I think the real problem is the fact that you can arrest someone on suspicion of a terrorist attack without proving their guilt/intent like you would normally do in a murder/intent to murder scenario. 

In terms of data mining also, although it's impossible, I think it's a broad decision by US citizens - if you know that known terrorists have engaged in a particular pattern of behaviour, and that other terrorists are likely to also engage in that behaviour, is it okay with you if anyone engaging in that pattern of behavior is scrutinized? Keep in mind the majority of suspects are also likely not to be terrorists. I can't answer that question for you, but for me, if the laws around the system protected me from being falsely accused, and the information was only used for the purpose of identify potential terrorists, then I think I may be okay with it. To be clear, I'm not saying that these conditions hold true. 

The second argument that it's an invasion of privacy/risk of abuse due to free access to personal records is reasonable enough. But can't the FBI/CIA/NSA get this information if they choose to anyway? (I'm seriously asking - because I don't know). It sounds like this system just makes it easier for them through the data warehouse (the article actually doesn't say how they use data mining for this system). 

I can completely understand why people don't trust the government with their information, since some of the new terrorist laws don't seem to protect their rights and are open to abuse. Just like a terrorist shouldn't be able to take away your life, the government shouldn't be able to take away a suspect's livelihood based on a hunch either. I think it's up to law enforcement to recognise that statistical likelihood isn't proof. 

It seems to me that the problem isn't really the system and the access to information. But it's the fact that there is a large amount of room for abuse by law enforcement because of the laws relating to suspected terrorists.

 I started thinking... how could you not notice...

But then I remembered my cat is really fluffy too, and we didn't notice she was pregnant until about 4 weeks before she gave birth to a litter of 4 kittens!! My mum was getting a little worried about my cat's weight and my sister felt her belly and could feel the kittens moving around inside!   




 I'm in Australia. Most gay men I know talk like normal people. I don't think most people would even know they were gay. 

Of my good gay friends, only one of the three is outwardly and obviously gay. He does act a bit like a girl so I think his behaviour is more of a giveaway than the way he talks. 

There would be some people here who talk in a certain way but I am guessing that is their way of expressing themselves, and it might seem 'put on' but maybe it is just their way of letting their personality and thoughts shine through. 




 I reckon you could encourage them to go for another one, but if they really want it then just go with it and be there to support them. My dad never came to any of my games, and while I don't care now when I was a younger I took that as a sign of disinterest/lack of caring about what I do (since sport was so important to me). 




 I'd agree with this. I did a *lot* of sports when I was young, and sport can help you in all areas of life - socially, physically, mentally. You learn how to make friends, how to keep healthy and fit, and how to cope when you're under pressure, how to deal with losing, how good it feels when you do win, and how to juggle sports with school and other activities.  




 I'm not sure if this is the same with most pregnant girls, but my sister at least went into a 'nesting' phase to make the house ready for the baby. If there's anything you can do to improve your house then I think that could help.

Also just give her lots of hugs - I've heard a hug has to be 7 seconds or longer for you to get that good/happy feeling out of it.

 Yeah definitely. My blinds were shining bright red when I got up, but now it is more of a grey and just looks a bit like fog. 




 I keep seeing that in all the photos in the newspaper.  My guess is they don't realise it's dust. When I woke up I thought it was red because of a fire, and then I looked outside it kinda looked like weird fog.  




 I'm pretty sick too with the flu - I've been at home all this week. I've had a lot of trouble sleeping the past couple of nights because of my coughing. This morning, I went outside for just a few seconds to take a look after I noticed the red sky, and came inside and was coughing up a lung. 

I can smell the dust inside but I didn't think it was that bad... Staying home today though.

 There's a few different kinds of late for me. 

First, there's the I'm late because I don't care - this usually involves being at work on time. It's true, it's a direct reflection on the fact that I dislike my job. I do wake up and set out to be on time but just feel lethargic and take forever to get out of the house because I know what lies ahead is another crap day at work. 

Second, I'm late because I have taken on too many things. I did have a job once that required me to be at work by 7am and I worked every day til 7pm. I used to always be rushing and driving way too fast, and found it too stressful. This was more that I didn't get to bed early the night before because I had too much on my schedule. I was working full time and studying part time and just had trouble staying on top of my assignments, sleep and work. 

Third, I'm late because I've been held up. Usually I'll be heading out the door and something important comes up at the last minute. It's not intentional but I have to deal with it at the time. Sometimes it's only 5 minutes, other times its longer, but I really try to ignore things whenever I can. 

Fourth, I'm late because I'm disorganised. I really do plan a time to get to things, but sometimes I just suck. Once I was away from my place on holidays, and forgot to turn on the hot water when I got back, and I stank like cat piss, so had to turn on the hot water so I could have a lukewarm shower to get to an event. Other times I lose my car keys or wallet, because I can also be a messy person. I really hate the fact that I'm me sometimes.

Fifth, I'm late because I'm me. Sometimes I just don't feel like I want to rush. It's stressful rushing, and I will probably just feel like crap if I rush. I won't be late for you if you are waiting in an uncomfortable spot for me though. I may be late if you are with other people and you're not waiting by yourself. I am often late if you are waiting in the comfort of your own home, and I'm pretty sure watching the tv for a few more minutes won't kill you.

There's probably other reasons for other circumstances but I can't think of them right now.

Just wanted to also add, it's not personal or intentional. If I didn't care then I wouldn't plan to see/meet you, and I wouldn't bother continuing a friendship. I realise that most people feel that it is inconsiderate and so more often these days I make a conscious effort to be on time, but what's a few more minutes anyway...

 




 For the other experiment, 21 people doesn't seem to be a big enough sample size once you divide them into 3 activity groups. Interesting results with the mice though...

 Some heels are more difficult to walk in. If you're having trouble, steer clear of tiny heeled stilettos, cause you'll probably just look silly trying to walk. 
If you can find something you like with a bigger heel surface area that touches the ground you'll have more stability and hopefully be more comfortable. If you don't mind wedges these can be great.
Another tip is if you're having trouble walking is try not to go for anything too pointy, cause that makes it harder to balance too. 




 Don't show off too much. Like everyone else said, keep to one feature. Otherwise it just looks tarty. Also don't wear anything too tight, being able to see where your underwear is pulling folds in your skin is not a good look. 

Also skirts should be at or below where your thigh starts to curve inwards is a good rule. 

Be comfortable and confident. You won't look classy and hot if you're uncomfortable with what you're wearing and/or can't walk properly, or if you keep trying to cover yourself. 

 




 There's always something to improve in any house, so I'd just pick something and then learn the different ways of doing it. Repeat as many times as you like. Often the best way to learn about something is to fix something broken. I learnt a lot about toilet cisterns because mine wouldn't stop dripping.  




 I am too busy to look after myself, and when I'm not too busy I make myself busy cause I don't want to think about my problems, but then I do and I get overwhelmed, because I don't look after myself and I get run down. Right now I have a broken shoulder and tonsilitis.

I am actually happy today though. I'd rather be injured and sick than have to go to work :) Plus I get to sleep a lot and eat jelly! 




 What's the occasion? How much do you want to spend?

For a view of the harbour - in customs house - [Cafe Sydney](http://www.cafesydney.com). More expensive and you have to book but great food and awesome view for an occasion (make sure you get the balcony).

For cheaper places, I really like Newtown for Thai (Thai Riffic for a nice seating place or Doytao Thai for cheaper food).

Tony Romas near King Street Wharf is awesome for Ribs. Kinda like american food.

My favourite pizza/italian place is [Made in Italy](http://www.madeinitaly.com.au). I've never eaten at Pyrmont but I have at Wynyard. Wynyard is a takeaway place but the pizza was excellent.

 I'm just wondering if anyone has any comments on using XML for data transfer of small data sets between organisations? My experience so far has been good for this purpose and I haven't noticed any problems. The data comes from HP and Oracle systems and we load it into SQL Server.

Also typed XML hasn't gotten much of a mention here. I thought the validation of a data type was a good thing. Does anyone have any comments on typed XML? 




 The emphasis on sport in Canada sounds similar to in Australia. It's not really like the US. We do have sports teams and maybe some students get sports scholarships (not really sure), but it definitely isn't as big of a deal as I've seen when visiting the US. The point made by Anand999 about getting people to fund the university through sports doesn't really apply here.

 I tried this at my work too, but only had my crappy phone to take a photo with. You could see heaps more than without the tape, as in make out objects, but it was pretty blurry.

That is looking out of a meeting room into the photocopier room! The photo is of tape on the frosted side - I could see both into and out of the room. 

Tried putting tape on both sides of the glass (frosted and non-frosted) - this made no a difference to the level of distortion compared to when it was only on the frosted side.

Tried putting tape on the non-frosted side and that didn't do anything - I couldn't see in or out!

 I actually find this interesting cause I have also found that (in my limited experience) that most of the discrimination towards me has come from other women.  




 Yeah my first job while I was still studying was as first level support on an IT helpdesk, and clients would ring up and assume that I was the receptionist and when I explained I wasn't and I was there to help them, sometimes they would still ask to speak to 'one of the boys'. I'd have to tell them that they were busy and ask again how I could help them. The guys were more experienced than me but 95-99% of client requests I was able to fix myself. 




 Being punched in the throat sucks, but I don't know that I'd like being punched in the boobs/chest either. Are they meant to punch you there? 




 Yeah that's tough. I had a friend who was in a similar situation as you. Some of the older female teachers were quite unfriendly. What level of teaching will you be doing? 




 I am a female in IT. I chose this field because I enjoy it, and it turns out I am good at it. I am not concerned about the gender bias because I feel my qualifications and experience speak for themselves, and so far that has been the case (the only time I have been discriminated against it has not affected my career progress). However, I'm relatively inexperienced and I would love to know other people's experiences in similar environments. 




 I will read, and then if I am feeling energetic still, I will write a list of all the things I have to do the next day, and the thought of that sometimes makes me mentally exhausted and I nod off. Plus if you're like me and think about all your problems, planning out the next day gives you something else to think about besides the problems. I also find that coming on the computer usually makes me stay up longer, so using it right before bed is often not a good idea for me if I'm trying to sleep.  




 Yes! I hate it when people do that on travelators and moving walkways too. Those things take so goddamn long. There's a shopping center near me and they have one on every level. Drives me crazy going there. It's 5 floors but if I know I'm going to the top level I take the carpark stairs instead.  




 I would probably call a pest controller. Then you can try to seal up/remove/clear clutter from any places where they are likely to hide. That is pretty hard when they hide in garden beds though I guess, but hopefully they won't go in your house. 




 Well that is bad timing. Just don't do what this guy did and leave his trousers on the floor between gardening sessions: http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23002709-5013016,00.html

 I was in a hotel in NYC a while back using the net in the narrow hallway cause the hotel signal didn't reach my room. This random creepy guy came past and asked me if I wanted to join the "party" in his room (with one other guy). I didn't use the net in the hallway anymore after that.   




 We recently had our headlamps replaced in our Toyota 4WD with some crappy ones when they broke. I don't think they were a genuine part, or they were 2nd hand. We drive about a 6-8hr drive (each way) at least 2 times a year in winter to go down south on highways and so we have to drive part of the way at night usually (cause we are slow getting away). The high beam on the old headlamps was really bad - I nearly hit a few dead kangaroos because of this. We got them replaced again with brand new ones after some scary driving experiences and it was HEAPS better - I could see at least 10 times as far. Didn't need HID lights, and I don't know why anyone really would need them. Definitely recommend replacing with the regular lights first before trying annoying HID lights. 




 I thought that the sound of thunder was the result of giants bowling in the sky on top of the clouds. 




 Is the $3 for a one way fare? Our tickets just went up today too. I used to pay AU$9.60 or sometihng like that for a return ticket to work on the train from my parents (approx 25km), but now it's AU$10 (USD$8.96/CAD$9.41) return. 

Bus isn't much better. When I'm at my city place (approx 5km from work), it costs me AU$2.60 each way on the bus.

I feel so ripped off.  




 We have trains here (Sydney). Then after 1am or something like that, they have nightride buses for most of the major train lines. Do you have anything like that once the subway stops or do you get stranded in the city/downtown?
 




 I think the gang-rape thing happened once or twice, and it hit newspapers pretty hard. I don't remember it being like a common trend. Most of those guys got decent prison sentences for the really bad rape, but some of them got away pretty lightly. 

The beach thing that happened was really disappointing. I definitely think the media fulled that incident, and I think most of the locals disapproved but there are idiots everywhere and sometimes it only takes a few. I definitely think there was a problem there long before this happened, and I think there still is. I honestly don't know what the solution is. Most of the guys are just stupid teenagers/young adults and are showing off to their friends in the most intolerable ways possible.
 




 I live in Sydney too. 

I agree about the people being rude. It's amazing how lonely you can feel with so many people around. I live and work in the city, but it is a bit stressful sometimes and I miss the open space that I have at my parents in the suburbs. Even then it's not as nice out there as it used to be, since the bush is now all gone and new housing developments went up when I was a kid. I remember when we used to go to the shopping centre everyone knew each other and we couldn't go through without mum having a million conversations... I used to think grocery shopping took forever... but now I realise we had it good. It's not like that as much anymore. 

Sure there are crowds at big events, but then again you don't have to go if you don't like that sort of thing. There are quite a few jerks around that just don't care about anyone else's experience, so you have to learn a great deal of tolerance and not let it get to you, otherwise you can never enjoy yourself. That said, sometimes it's hard to ignore. I went out to dinner one night (kind of late - 11pm), and saw 3 people throw up in the street while we were walking to the restaurant (in the space of one block). I was kind of glad we were too late to get food from for the restaurant. If you are with a group of friends and can ignore it, the atmosphere can be great (as long as you know the best spot to go). 

With the immigration, I agree there's a problem there in terms of people actively not wanting to be part of Australian society. Obviously I am glad some people have cultural identity, and can feel like they belong somewhere, but so often I feel like some have no respect for any other race or culture aside from their own, and often do try to intimidate you so they can force some sort of feeble excuse for respect from you. It's not like that everywhere in Sydney, and I think you can have a completely different experience and quality of life if you live in a nicer suburb as you suggested. I think that's like a lot of large cities as well, and because I haven't lived anywhere very long term I don't know enough to say that other places are any better. I'd like to think they would be though.

I used to go surfing a bit when I was younger and nowadays I don't like it so much. I used to go to Cronulla (where the riots happened a few years back) quite regularly. I had some problems myself long before that incident. I don't like city beaches much anymore. Especially after finding 3 syringes in the sand on separate occasions. That all said I will still go surfing and for most of the time (not hot ones cause those are the days that attract the idiots), it is a nice place. Advice tho: wear thongs   don't build sandcastles far away from the water's edge cause the rubbish tractors don't clear the edges of the beach very well.  

I used to love Sydney because I thought it had everything - beautiful harbour, beautiful beaches, convenient local area shopping centers, good restaurants, good nightlife, multiculturalism, etc. - but as I get older and see more of Sydney I think sometimes I feel that the things I dislike about it are outweighing the benefits as well. 

I have really mixed feelings about this place, and so often I do feel like I hate it. I definitely want to get out and experience other places as well. 

 




 My biggest fear is making a mess of my life, and screwing it up so bad I will lose everyone and everything that matters, and will eventually die alone with my own self pity and regret. 




 Shakespeare had a lot of themes in his plays, like greed, guilt, temptation, love, hate, revenge, forgiveness, violence, jealousy, etc. Maybe if you can pick a theme that interests you it might be a starting point for some ideas. (Oh, and I'm not saying to do a shakespeare style play or anything like that... just to get some ideas).

Otherwise what would interest your audience? Or you? What's something you've learned in life, or a interesting event that has happened? Anything interesting you've learned from someone else?  




 We were out watching fireworks a few years back and after they end the city goes crazy with drunks everywhere. I saw this girl and guy fighting, after which the guy punches her in the face. Probably cause she is a bit drunk she falls straight from her feet onto her head on the curb, with no arm out or anything. I hear this loud cracking noise as her head hits the curb, and the guy walks off, leaving her with her friend. The girl was probably okay because I heard her screaming and crying after she fell. I saw some police nearby who are stopping people from going on the bridge. I walked up to the first one and explained what happened a few meters away and asked if he could call an ambulance. He explained he was too busy watching the bridge. I walked over to the other cop working with him who was clearly the more senior cop and he called an ambulance. Not blaming the cop they were probably overwhelmed but that was a weird thing to see. 




 I think this time she should get all the cash. Maybe next time half :P 




 Explosive Diarrhea 




 I have this (Lite White):
http://www.dairyfarmers.com.au/df/ourproductsandrecipes/milk/dairyfarmersbrlitewhite

I used to hate skim milk but I am lactose intolerant so I get sick drinking full cream milk now. But I can drink this and it tastes good. 

I should get a job advertising this milk. 




 When I was a kid, my sister and I thought it was a great idea to eat hot two minute noodles (including the boiling water) on the trampoline. It was decided I would get up there first, she'd pass me the bowl (which I held on my lap), and then she'd get up afterwards, and we could enjoy noodles and trampolining concurrently.

I burnt my whole right upper leg and spent a few weeks sitting down and having this white cooling cream applied to the burns.  




 The OP annoyed the Twatty guy, who got up in anger and asked the rhetorical question "Do you know who my father is?" as if implying he is a man of great influence or importance, and someone not to be messed with. 

By interpreting the question non-rhetorically you could assume the person really doesn't know who their father is. The OP uses this to offend the Twatty guy by responding with "No. Have you tried asking your mother?" and implying that the mother either slept around or was no longer involved with the father of the Twatty guy.

I'm not great with explanations but hopefully that clears it up. 




 You're welcome! Happy New Year! 




 Looks like you're there! :P 




 Most of my debt is from FEE-HELP/HECS. 




 The only big accident I've had was reversing into my sister's car from the garage cause the outside light was broken and my car is a bit chunky at the back and I didn't look properly. 

Then after this, instead of getting out to check the damage, I drove forward again to separate the cars and pulled out some pipe full of oil that my tow bar had got stuck under. The car was spurting oil all over the driveway. Oh god I'm stupid. 




 Read the news, learn about other ways of life, meet non-US born people and learn some of the other countries' history.

I think learning history will make you appreciate other cultures more, and the things they have done in the past and present.

Also I liked doing charity volunteering a little while ago just on a few occasions, but for the few days I did it, the whole time I was thinking about how little people in these other places had and how much capacity we have to give.  




 Thanks. That's both disgusting and informative. 

Wouldn't wearing socks mean your feet don't dry properly though and you would make the bacteria growth worse? I mean even if I dry my feet with a towel I like to let them air a little bit before putting on socks or shoes. 




 My cousin is like this. He wouldn't eat anything besides meat and rice. My dad used to always ask him if he was constipated. 




 Same with me. I couldn't have any type of cheese unless it was melted on toast or pizza. Then I was introduced slowly to all different types of cheese and I realised that there are a billion types of cheese besides tasty cheese and those cheese sticks which I still think are gross! 

I still don't like all cheese but sometimes cheese just makes a sandwich or a meal! :) 




 Did you get an invite? I have a friend who's been on reddit for 2 months but won't be able to join cause apparently it's too short :(

It sucks cause he's the one who introduced me to reddit, he just didn't sign up for ages! 




 I sent you something small to say thanks! You started something awesome on reddit! :) 




 They have a minimum length of membership too. :( 




 I usually find a comment that says the same thing I would say and upvote it - otherwise you would have 1000 comments that are exactly the same, and that's kind of boring to read. 




 This is awesome. Thank you! Merry Christmas :) 




 I just found this. Thanks!

 Cronulla. They upgraded the STP back in 1998 - haven't had any more ear infections since luckily. It used to be the dirtiest beach water in Sydney before that. 

One of my friends mum's also used to surf and now has permanent ear problems from getting ear infections, so I'm glad nothing permanent has happened to me.  




 SMH:
[http://www.smh.com.au/national/skydiver-dead-after-13th-jump-20091128-jxz5.html](http://www.smh.com.au/national/skydiver-dead-after-13th-jump-20091128-jxz5.html)

I think a couple of people die every year out there. I would freak out at that particular place cause they get dropped out right near the highway. I've seen some guys get pretty close to the traffic. 




 Yeah I used to get quite a few ear infections before they upgraded the sewage treatment plant.  




 I've swum there! I'm still more scared of [box jellyfish](http://www.barrierreefaustralia.com/the-great-barrier-reef/jellyfish.htm) than great whites, because with box jellyfish:
 

 You have virtually no chance of surviving the venomous sting, unless treated immediately. The pain is so excruciating and overwhelming that you would most likely go into shock and drown before reaching the shore. 









 I think some of it is to do with attitude towards a problem. 

The bigger the learning curve the more fear you have I.e. the bigger the perceived 'hardness'.

Sometimes learning something new can be really hard, because you might not have all the necessary background knowledge or know the terminology, and so at first you don't take it in. If you persist with it long enough and get past this point, the result can be really rewarding. 

I sometimes think maybe people have found something hard, began working on it but not persisted long enough to get the reward. So the next time they see a problem, they have an even bigger mental barrier because they didn't feel the satisfaction from last time. If this is a problem, at least for me I found the best thing to do is break it down into parts and then each time you understand a part you will feel a bit better - trying to understand a huge problem in one go can be really demotivating. 




 I went out with a guy that smoked and I didn't let him do it around me. I didn't break up with him, but I still didn't like it.

I don't consider objecting to someone else smoking as being controlling - more that you care about that person and don't want them to get addicted, waste money or damage their health. In reality, I could never stop him from smoking - he could just do it behind my back - but I did tell him how I felt about it and in the end he made his own decision to quit. 




 * Like this magnet on metal we joining together,
So make sure you're there when we make it forever.

* You might remember this date in your head,
But to be safe here's a magnet with the date we will wed.

* We'd love you to be attending our wedding, 
So here's a magnet so you don't go forgetting.

* Put this magnet somewhere you'll remember,
The date we'll make our vows together!

* This invitation has a magnetic field,
To make sure you're there when we seal the deal! 




 Don't you get cockroaches or insects? I live in a unit - if I left dishes out the cockroaches would come from all the other units and infest my place.  




 I don't expect everyone to smile back or that they are necessarily depressed cause they don't smile back, but I like it when they do.  




 It's for the buses. You buy ten trips in advance on Sydney Buses, and put it into the green ticket reader box when you get on a bus and it reads the magnetic strip and prints the trip on the back (bus number and time). They've been around for a while but you didn't have to use them before.
See the [Transport Infoline Website](http://www.131500.com.au/faresandpasses/sydneybuses_travelten.asp). Looks like [this](http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/object3/1528/118/n91760107804_3407.jpg) - non-concession adult has white instead of yellow background. 




 Everyone poops! If you didn't paint her walls with your poop I don't see any problem. Besides that, I guess it's her fault if her walls are so thin she can hear.
 
I can think of a few things you can do though:

A) You can try turning on the tv or radio beforehand if possible. Then just let it rip. Flush it and act like nothing happened. Avoid going near the bathroom for a while.

B) Get her to go to the toilet first and then act subtly disgusted and pretend like it sounded/smelt horrible. Then she'll be so worried about how horrible her poo was she won't even care if yours sounds/smells bad. 

C) Show her how awesome the poo you just did was. 




 Friendliness. Where I live people can be pretty unfriendly, and I hardly see people smile... it's kind of sad. I try to smile at people (whenever it's not weird) and I really like it when people smile back. :)  




 It's kind of hard to notice things when you live here cause it happens so slowly when you're here. Here's a few things I can think of off the top of my head:

* The Harbour Bridge and some other places are now cashless. You need one of those e-tags to cross it now. I hate toll roads. 

* Buses around the city require you to have a travel 10 to get on/off buses during peak periods (I think it's 7am-7pm but I can't remember), so you can't pay cash to travel. I think this is probably a good thing but most people who travel regularly get Travel 10s anyway cause they're cheaper. 

* There was some stuff going on with Bikie Gangs which is still happening. They [bludgeoned some guy to death at the domestic terminal](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/30/2530292.htm). 

* The international airport (departure) was getting upgraded and had barely any food in the food court there. It sucks to hang around at before a flight. [Due to finish 2010](http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/sacl/International-Terminal---Expansion-and-Upgrade.html).

* If you're already in Australia this won't make any difference but here anyway - 
[Utility costs have gone up](http://www.switzer.com.au/latest-news/news-stories/record-lift-in-utility-charges-proves-inflation-bogy/): 
Utility charges rose by a record (37 years) 10.2 per cent in the September quarter. Utility charges rose by 13.4 per cent over the year  the biggest increase in 26 years.

* Pitt Street mall is going through an upgrade. Not a very pretty sight at the moment (not that it really was before).

* RTA penalties for speeding have changed a few times now. P platers have zero alcohol limit now, and there are some new anti-hoon laws. 

* More and more school zones have flashing lights now when it is 40km/h

* God damn birds! I used to open my balcony window in the mornings, but the miner birds are trying to nest, and a pair flew into my unit (I'm on the 4th floor), as did a pigeon. Pigeons at least are pretty predictable and so that one just kept flying at the window trying to get out. I caught it with a towel and let it out. Then a few days later some miner birds flew in and were scared shitless of me, so shitless, they shat all over my unit. I had bird poop everywhere. This, along with the time a turkey tried to steal my lunch, now mean I only like some birds. 
 




 I hate cyclists mainly because of their outfits. How streamlined do they really need to be? I want to hold my food down. 




 Thanks for this article. I heard so many different opinions and didn't really understand what was going on. It makes more sense now.  




 From the Telegraph: [link](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/grant-edward-brown-refused-bail-after-being-charged-with-unprovoked-attack-on-circular-quay-to-manly-ferry/story-e6freuy9-1225798655514)

**Grant Edward Brown refused bail after being charged with unprovoked attack on Circular Quay to Manly ferry**

*November 17, 2009 3:31PM*


A PERSONAL trainer accused of striking a 70-year-old man in the head in a bout of unprovoked violence on a Manly ferry has been refused bail for the protection of the community.

Grant Edward Brown, 31, was charged with recklessly wounding after the incident on the Queenscliff ferry shortly after it left Circular Quay at 6pm yesterday.

Police allege Brown, visiting from Tasmania, struck John Edward Lane once to the face, causing him to fall heavily and his head hit the ground.

Documents tendered to Central Local Court this afternoon have revealed Brown was allegedly talking loudly and aggressively on a telephone shortly before the incident.

To the unknown person on the phone, Brown allegedly said: If someone on this ferry gets their head punched in, it will be on you.

A short time later, he was allegedly acting aggressively, kicking walls and bins before a companion of Mr Lanes then alleged approached him and told him to calm down.

He refused, threatening to bash your head in.

When Mr Lane then interjected urging him to relax as well, he was told: Step away, I swear Im going to punch your f***ing head in.

He then allegedly struck Mr Lane with a closed fist, causing the victim to fall to the ground and strike his head on the deck.

Witnesses have told police of seeing a large amount of blood and then hearing the accused man become hysterical: Someone help him, someone help him.

Magistrate Allan Moore refused the Tasmanian bail, saying he was not satisfied that the community would be safe if he was released to bail.

The case will be re-mentioned on Friday.
 




 Sure they have good facilities but how come it still looks so grey and work-like :( 




 I'm not sure if you mean modern day or older times, but for people who really travelled long distances, look up the older explorers from before the 19th century. 

You can start with this [list of explorers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_explorers) on Wikipedia. 




 Do you live under a bridge? 




 This is good but more relevant for essays and reports I think. 




 Those are pretty good. I like the [single fork](http://www.moolf.com/images/stories/Interesting/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe-9.jpg), [can lid](http://www.moolf.com/images/stories/Interesting/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe-14.jpg) and the [bee](http://www.moolf.com/images/stories/Interesting/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe/Beautiful-Macro-Photography-by-Bonali-Giuseppe-33.jpg).  




 Yeah that's the difference. Ours get a decent wage so we don't have to tip. 

I also only recently learned you have to tip in Canada too. I thought they had the same system as Australia. 
 




 Does it vary from place to place or is it the same all over the US?
 




  Try to die in a month when the demand for funeral services is low.  Perhaps the summer or a temperate spring.  Your loved ones may get a good deal that way.

Okay I'll do my best. 




 Some of the first shots at night are a bit too dark to really see anything, or from different angles. The later ones are good. It's interesting to see most things haven't changed that much though. 




 Did it taste like Fanta?  




 Can someone explain to me how tipping works?

I gathered this:

Most places: 15%

Small towns: 10%

NYC: 20%

And then is it 5% either side of that if you liked or didn't like the service?
 




 My uncle went on the Queen Elizabeth II cruise ship and it was all you can eat all the time. He said there were some americans that had the following meals (each with a full buffet style serving):

* Breakfast

* Morning Tea

* Brunch

* Lunch

* Afternoon Tea

* Dinner (Entres included)

* Dessert

* Supper

When they docked they didn't have enough time to unload all the human waste - there were trucks lining up to take away the sewerage, so the ship left with still plenty of gunk on board.

He is not young (75+) and he said they were the fattest people he'd seen in his life. 




 Yeah :( 

It took me ages to notice too cause I always stare out the window. I only noticed once we went into the tunnels and I saw his reflection in the window.  




 I get the train and the bus, and I don't like public transport because:

* It's expensive

* It's slow

* If the buses fills up they don't stop to let passengers on. So you can't rely on it to get you somewhere on time. The next bus might not be for another 20 minutes.

* Has sick people spreading their illnesses

* It's uncomfortable and crowded - sometimes I can't get a seat and have to stand up, and sometimes I get squished by someone, I also do my groceries and have to carry them on my lap because someone decided to sit next to me with all my groceries instead of one of the other free chairs.

* It's dirty - people always leave their rubbish on the train, especially the later ones after peak hour.

* Bad experiences - a guy once jerked off next to me on the train.


I still catch public transport only because

* It's still slightly cheaper than driving

* The train can be faster than driving in peak hour

I sometimes stay near work and just walk to work, but it is 4km over fairly hilly terrain and can be a little tiring after a long work day, and not that safe. 




 The rule only applies to diagraphs ([link](http://alt-usage-english.org/I_before_E.html)). 




 Or nutella and banana! 




 Fair enough, I guess I found it hard to know what to buy. I half expected that multi grain bread would be just savoury type bread with grains in it, but it was heaps sweet. We don't have any bread that is sweet in the supermarket. Maybe if I went with an American they could have shown me what to buy.  




 I just went to a regular supermarket.  




 Don't worry about that! Just go for it! Have a little faith in yourself. The more obstacles you overcome the more confidence you'll gain, and things will hopefully become easier for you the more experience and knowledge you get. 




 I have always had pretty clear skin, but acne never bothered me on anyone else.

My ex had a lot of acne. When he got older it just went away naturally. He got a face peel done and it looked like he'd never had acne in the first place.  




 oink oink 




 I think what's gross is how pretty much all American food has a high concentration of sugar. For example, bread, cheese, breakfast cereals. The cheese from a regular supermarket there actually tastes like McDonalds cheese, and the bread is like lolly bread. Where do Americans go to buy savoury things, or things with no sugar?  




 I love avocados! 




 I think the US has the largest meal sizes for McDonalds. It's bad enough in the small sizes but the big sizes are just sickening (yet somehow still tasty). 

Their small meal size is equivalent to our medium, and their medium is our large. I'm not sure if a US-sized large McDonalds meal even exists here. 




 Does anyone actually finish their plate there? I've been to the US a couple of times now and I never finished a meal. They were like family sized servings. 




 I don't think your host family is representative of the rest of Australia. We eat pumpkin plenty. But we just don't normally make it into a pie. 




 Sorry, I have no idea. I'm not in that area. I'd need the name of the article to find it. Can you remember the author or journal name? Maybe try a search there. If you can find an link online that's even better. 




 Did you have to pee when you woke up? 




 Bleach is the way to go. Just make sure the room is well ventilated.

Also [DON'T mix bleach and ammonia](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/classic/A795611). It produces toxic gases. Ammonia is contained in some household cleaners ([link](http://www.npi.gov.au/database/substance-info/profiles/pubs/ammonia.pdf)).

  




 This is all John West's fault. We don't have to have the best!! All tuna is excellent. 




 Take lunch breaks. For my first job I didn't. You need that - even 15 minutes - to just have a break and calm/de-stress yourself.

 Good Irish Yodel Farts? 




 Go in for the kiss and when she closes her eyes to wait for it, slap on some wax and let it rip! She'll thank you later. 




 Bad timing 




 A table was standing next to two stacked chairs. A gnome wearing a pointy hat was learning how to dance. He took three steps right and knocked the chairs off their neat stack. 




 Also good if you're paying for part of a meal shared with friends. Then you can just round up the amount to the nearest whole note you have.
