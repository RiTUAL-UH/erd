 Kill everything? That could be one 




 On Page 13, Phillip's Dad says "Roll it around in your hand. *You've that thing* for nearly two years, Phillip." As you can tell, you're missing a "had" 




 This is my favourite one XD 




 For me it was SneakerHeadInTheBay, he would end his videos with Cocoa Butter Kisses. 









 I was waiting for someone to request Baby Blue lol. But it should be done by tommorow 




 Are they different? I just say "ediring" to make it simpler to understand is all. 




 It's there now lol, sorry 




 Lol, thanks. It's there now 




 So, in this [picture](https://www.imgur.com/4y36GGP), the left side of the plant is dead, while the right is alive. But they're connected at the root. Why? 









 I said to give me suggestions for songs to edit [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChanceTheRapper/comments/2y0wdw/give_me_suggestions/) and I did them. Here is [Iconic](http://bit.ly/1APkSZl) (only a DL link) and 
[Long Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YxLKumuzQI),
Give me some more! I can do any song!

 nbsp;

EDIT: "Iconic" got taken down from YouTube for copyright, so I will just have the DL link there. 




 I have never agreed with something more. Please Stu, please. 




 So, a while ago, I edited the song "Confident" by Justin Bieber   Chance The Rapper to *only* include Chance's verse [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChanceTheRapper/comments/2x8eto/justin_bieber_no_more/). Give me suggestions of songs to do this with! Any song that Chance is in, and you want his verse singled out, I can do. 




 I have watched FMA once over, and I don't really wanna get into Brotherhood cause I watched some of it and it looked *veeery* similar to regular FMA. (I know, I sound ignorant) but, just give me reasons to watch it, I'm interested on what you all will say. 




 Tony Bennett, The Ink Spots, VI Seconds, CES Cru, Logic, Frank Sinatra, Avenged Sevenfold, Sleeping With Sirens, Vic Mensa, Mac Miller, and like all of OF.

I'm a bit varied. 




 I edited the song "Confident" and took out most of the Justin Bieber. Only the bridge + the hook is in there.

 This makes me sad. 




 My pleasure man. 




 As promised:

You are all welcome 




 I really wanna play it, and I see others have access to it as well. So, I was wondering if there was a download link or something along those lines, in which to acquire this wonderful game. 




 You can't. 




 This will be done. 




 I jumped in a pool to save my 2 year old niece. I usually think about shit but that just kinda happened w/o me thinking 
























 They are satan. 




 Thank you for educating a young fellow like I. 




 It's in the old one though, by the way. Not the new one that just came out. 




 I do like the warped vocals of Ocean Man, and some of their songs aren't too appealing. I would suggest [Mutilated Lips] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzIHkFJnLbc) if you haven't heard it 




 Yeah, it's the outro song as the credits are playing. 




 Practice wife? 




 I personally haven't seen much *hate*, more of just people wanting Surf and getting frustrated. No one on this Subreddit could hate Chance really. 









 2:44 AM, ~4,000 views from 1,000,000. Currently on my 3^rd listen. 




 Definitely a close 2^nd for me. 




 People do crazy things when they're desperate. 




 Oh what the fucking dicks.

One of my favourite songs off "The Mollusk" that was released in 1997. And yes, I did find them off of the Spongebob Movie. 




 I'm interpreting the line "Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment are gearing up to drop their debut album, *Surf*, this week featuring Chance the Rapper." as in that they are gearing up this week for the release. Not that they are *releasing* Surf this week, but that they are *preparing* for the drop. 




 I'm decently sure you can't do that 




 I'm glad I could turn you on to them. They're one of my favourite brands as of now 




 I didn't know people resold Greats' shoes lol 









 I just rock a 3/5 Fade. At least that's what I call it. Nothing fancy 




 *upvotes furiously* 




 Can someone please explain this 




 Considering neither #10Day nor Acid Rap were on vinyl, I would assume that the answer is no (rather sadly, might I add). However, this *is technically* Donnie's project that Chance has a big part in. So, we won't know until it happens.
