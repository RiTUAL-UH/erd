 You definitely will have to choose between being a computational expert, or a synthesis person or a characterization expert. If you want to do 2D materials do apply to Penn State, Berkeley, GaTech and Rice. 




 1) No. You won't if you are doing electronic materials. But having a solid state physics course will be worth its weight in gold. A big misconception about MatSE is that it is chemistry heavy, but unless you are doing polymers you don't need to worry.

2) Many EE profs are in the fab side - ask them. Also do NOT go by US news rankings - they are utter shit in MSE.

3) I am male, but several of my friends are female in MSE, and they mostly say the atmosphere is collegial apart from the obvious overwork aspect.

4) If you really want to go for MSE - I will say go for it. But your GPA will be counted against you. It is hard to get into a good program below a 3.5 unless you have some really good experience that a PI wants or you have publications during your undergrad. 




 Do you have a good friend in your group? If possible try interacting with this lab tech along with your friend.
And email EVERYTHING. Before you meet him, after always. My rule for interacting with difficult people - take your notebook, and jot down stuff while interacting, and send an email immediately after confirming all the things discussed. Always helps. 




 There was a similar study in Economics - where Harvard, MIT and Chicago produce the bulk of new faculty.
Same in my field - materials science where the top 10 schools (top 10 is a bit debatable though) produce the majority of faculty.  




 Could you ask the company for a deferment of the job till your PhD is done?
 




 Have you taken the physics GRE? If you are looking into physics schools that counts much more often. 




 For me it has been working with an untenured faculty in a big, prominent department. They are scared, and under pressure for tenure, and all that is transferred to you with a vengeance.  




 Yes, I buy the cheapest beer possible. Every night downing a few while chain smoking is my new "me time". 




 Same here at Penn State. The campus is now dry. The school has even rescheduled its Spring Break to coincide with St. Patrick's Day so that undergrads are out of town then. 




 Yeah I was a lurker, before I decided to take the plunge, and I will learn a bit more before posting next time :) 














 I know, but as girls are bombarded 24 hours with photoshopped washn\board abs, even those comfortable in bodies feel inadequate. Just my 2 cents. 




 ya, pirate drones!!  




 Several years back, when cleaning out my grandfather's stuff we found his old Omega watch that everyone assumed had been lost for 60 years. And my first reaction was how small men's watches were back in the day! 
























 One of my friends had this exact same track (BS in Chemistry, then worked at L'Oreal, and came to materials science). My advice - you have to pay. 
As in get an unfunded masters at a decent school (top 20 will still be difficult to get into), work on research there. If your MS GPA is much better (shoot for 3.5+) - you are all set.
The con - the whole thing will not be cheap, because the dirty secret in STEM fields is that MS programs are university cash cows - so going unfunded for two years is going to cost you in the ballpark of $100,000.  




 Sadly, since he is tenure-track he will probably be railroaded. The Hunger Games that departments play during tenure sickens me. 




 Not wrong - but there is something about academia that allows toxic behaviors to fester much longer than any half-decent HR department would tolerate. Actually, HR supervision in academia almost never happens. 




 Observation from my own university: The grad student a year ahead of me in my school - are uber competitive, and many are outright toxic to work with. On the other hand, PhD students who joined with me are super nice, and we hang out after hours all the time. Same for the year junior to me. Even though one of our Assistant Professors who did his PhD from this school remarks that his cohort was much friendlier than any of ours. By the way, from this admittedly very small sample space i observed that competitiveness has no correlation with productivity. 
Two final remarks - collaboration is a must today in my field. If you want to publish in a top-tier journal you must collaborate. And secondly, being an international student from Asia myself - I find that Asian students are much more competitive, and less collaborative and contribute to the department atmosphere overall in a negative rather than a positive fashion. 




 I have several Israeli friends, and they hate, hate orthodox jews with a passion. 




 Nopes, in fact just the opposite - I had Asian parents 




 Not visiting my sick grandmother back home. Not worth it. 




 Much, much higher expectations. Failure will be much less tolerated, as people would expect you to be more productive from day 1 - (not for students who enter PhD directly from a BS - those guys catch an yearlong break).
Personally, after my MS and in a full time PhD I was surprised how sick and tired I had become of the whole classes-homework-exams grind. I almost had to pay for my negligence in that aspect. 




 Every department has its share of known assholes. And they will often be tolerated if they bring boatloads of cash.
Honestly though in my experience, untenured faculty are much worse. There are several horror stories in my department, but they are for another time, another place. 




 No, in hindsight that guy had severe anger management issues. As everyone knows grad school can often be stressful, and I have seen that my criticisms are much more harsh when I am more tired or stressed out. But it is not a valid excuse, and I am trying to work on it . 




 Years before when I was a junior FOB grad student at my previous university for my M.S. I worked with a terrible bully. It was an year which almost destroyed my confidence. Now at my current university, I am now a senior, and actually productive grad student. And I find myself being a jerk often to my junior students. Granted they are making mistakes. But on reflection, those mistakes are made by everyone early on, and were even made by me. 
Fellow subredditors, have you ever faced this? And how did you change? 




 I was on probation - got a C and had my GPA drop down to 2.84 but it is OK now - it is 3.55. In my experience, even a below 3 did not matter much. 




 1) How highly advisor dependent the whole thing is. Universities matter for resources, but your grad school experience will be massively influenced with the relationship you have with your advisor. Corollary: How terribly unstructured things are.

2) The biggest challenge IMO is to keep yourself motivated when things don't work out, which they often don't. Fear honestly drives me more often.

3) I get by really poorly financially, and do have some debt now.

4) I am still poor in structuring time - even though because I had been really productive the last few months I see light at the end of the tunnel - I will get by working 10 hours a day a few months from now on.

5) In the first year, despite what everyone says do not focus too much on research. Keep that year aside for degree requirements. It will be much less stressful later on that way.

6) OK. I have some very close friends, and I make it a point to attend parties and bars at least once every two weeks to keep myself sane. 




 1) A great fountain pen.
2) Cool bound lab notebooks with my name on it - like the custom ones from Bookfactory
3) A computer monitor
