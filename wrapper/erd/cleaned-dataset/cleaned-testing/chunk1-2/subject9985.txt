 I didn't even know what one of those was until right now and mine is raging! 




 Yeah I think it was captioned something like that but I thought it just seemed a bit random in comparison to the rest of the documentary. Wasn't sure if it was actually a younger family member or something.

Still, wish I was taken under Jack White's wing when I was that age!  




 That bit was awesome! But who was the strange orphan boy that followed him everywhere?? 




 Really?? I always assumed it started using the necks of beer bottles but that's way more disgusting and cool!

And I found the album on spotify so I'll check it out, cheers for the recommendation 




 Check this out, it's what made me have to buy one

 I've got a tuner so I'm just messing around with a few and seeing how they sound. Got it tuned open D at the moment but my capo is fast becoming my best friend for switching to open E 




 Man I used to love those songs a few years back, good choices! 




 Just started off with A Boy's Best Friend, nice and simple but really satisfying to play! Thanks! 




 After watching "it might get loud" last night and watching Jimmy Page, Edge and Jack White do an awesome bit of slide improv I headed straight out today to get a slide.

Anybody got any good song recommendations for me to learn? And perhaps more importantly are there any drills I should practice with it? 




 Well that was easy! 




 RIP this subreddit  




 10 hours a day?! That's insane! I might break this into 1 hour a day for a month or something  




 While I admire what he achieve with his body, this guy is a massive douche and represents everything wrong with male culture today.

Downvotes ahoy!  




 Where did you get the reddit pick? Awesome! 




 Not saying you're wrong, but why?  




 This is awesome to jam to, love it! 
























 I did half-GOMAD about a year or so ago and it definitely did work. The biggest problem is trying to adapt to a normal diet afterwards - milk doesn't really stretch your stomach that much and I found that I actually lost weight when I tried to switch back to solid foods as I couldn't eat as many solid calories. 




 Fun fact, I work in insurance and when you allow your email to be shared with third partys that includes us. We then use this info to help track you down if you flee an accident. 




 I used to work at Game in the UK. I remember other sales people thinking I was mad for not forcing a pre-order on this nervous little 9 year old kid who clearly didn't want it. I guess I just don't have the killer instinct needed for sales. 




 Shot from the new paranormal activity movie? 




 Pssssht I account share anyway, I'll give him my login and we'll use the netflix money to make a statue or something  




 I forgot I'd subscribed to this sub and thought /r/showerthoughts had gotten really deep!

But you make a fascinating point and I think I agree with you, whether or not I'm happy about it is another thing entirely. 




 Label your knuckles as in the picture

All raised knuckles have 31 days, all grooves between knuckles have 30 (except for that dastardly February which has 28) 




 Doing a poop. 




 I suppose it's just famously used in both a wartime perspective and a peace perspective. Maybe they do mean the same thing, or maybe they're not linked at all, either way nobody I spoke to in person knew so I thought I'd ask historians. 




 It just occurred to me that the "v" gesture changed from a war-related symbol to the complete opposite! Any insight would be much appreciated. 




 Although I'm just a beginner I did read a paragraph on this in a gourmet shaving book today, the author said if a brush is still doing this after 1-2 weeks you should contact the seller. 




 I definitely will, I couldn't believe how generous it was! I want to shave 10 times tonight so I can try it all out! 




 He wrote a note that said "exceptionally cold" as well haha! Your warning has been heeded! 




 I just got given a sample of this but I'm totally new to shaving properly, should I be excited?? 









 Goodbye xbox live membership!
