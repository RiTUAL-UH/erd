 "Kill Bill Siren" was awesome. These seriously make my week. You should do them for Better Call Saul!!! That subreddit would be extremely grateful.  




 crazy bastard 




 What I hoped for this post: something other than the obvious.  




 I didn't find this scene funny, but the fact that you did kills me.  




 Bill from Kill Bill. Not saying the five point palm exploding heart technique sucks....but he's a dude we have waited through TWO movies to see die. And he falls. On the grass. Cool. 




 Jump to Conclusions App.  




 There has to be some angle in this decision. Surely he's not ACTUALLY thinking he's above Rick's group and their decisions. He still carries the guilt of the people he left to die AND he knows he would be dead if it wasn't for Grimes and Co. So I'm thinking there's another angle that we just aren't seeing yet. Thoughts? 




 These are my new friends; the Van Buren Boys.  




 No dough....no show. 




 I seriously cant stop singing that song. "Arizona moon is shining" 




 "Great! You shot the invisible swordsman!" 




 Goodnight Ned. 




 Infamous is when you're more than famous. This guy El Guapo isnt just famous....he's INfamous.  




 Ha! My bad. I'm in.  




 I think he means that if you- SHUT UP!! 




 Tell us we will die like dogs.  




 Can I have your watch when you are dead? 




 I saw this movie as a kid and absolutely loved it. Watched again as an adult and still am drawn to quoting it and singing along. Chevy Chase, Steve Martin and Martin Short are perfect in this movie. I don't see this movie mentioned very much, but I recommend it to ANYONE who hasn't seen it.  




 I gave you a downvote.  




 I think you'd be in serious trouble if this subreddit ever found out where you live.  




 Hahaha!! That is exactly what I was looking for. The Lost Boys is so damn good btw.  




 I wasn't referring to famously misquoted lines. But personal lines that you just misheard and said wrong for a time.  









 After going through OPs post history, I have concluded he is 12 years old and needs to find another site to be annoying on.  




 I think you overestimate redditors and their love for posting absolutely anything; even if they literally just read the same post. 




 Hollywood's best kept secret in transforming characters: glasses  




 Greg Kinnear. Every time. Always. Forever. Captain Amazing.  




 Because Andrew here is very interested in pursuing a career in the custodial arts. 




 What're you referring to exactly? I feel like the obvious answer is 'no' and maybe you just got unlucky and saw a bunch of slow-song trailers in a row.
