 Exactly! I don't know how you can get a job at a bookstore without at least knowing Faulkner 




 "As I stand before you today, I can tell you why we shouldn't change minimum wage. You may think I'm a rich man. This is a lie. I work minimum wage like a lot of you. Pleas don't expect people to pay more, so we may feed and take care of our families. Please don't ask my employer to pay me more... It's not like he can afford it. Please don't make me a burden to other's. I should be thankful to have a job, right? Is that what I'm expected to say? My children should suffer for the mistakes a younger me made. Because that will make them work harder? Make them get jobs as soon as they can, so they won't focus on school and resent me later for not being able to provide? So they will be stuck in this never-ending cycle of poverty due to not having the support to get a higher education? Yes, this is the life I've always dreamed of. As a child, I dreamed of never having a set schedule, never getting to go to school functions, having to miss my children growing up due to having to work more and more to support them, not getting holidays with my family, being terrified of illness because I can't afford not to work. This is the American dream, right? But please, don't make my employers pay me a living wage... As if I deserve it after staying late, coming in early, and never calling in. What more do I do? I could easily be replaced. I am nothing. Is this what I deserve? Is this what we deserve? Most of us "leech" of the "working" while working more hours than normal. They see nothing more than my food stamp card. They don't know that I work more than I sleep. They don't see me. They don't see you... Just leeches. But remember please, don't ask for more pay. Your CEO doesn't have that kind of money. Stop being so selfish why don't you? It's not like you have the right to spend time with your loved ones."

A man who's job was threatened if he didn't give a speech against minimum wage, give his boss exactly what he wants yet doesn't expect. 




 Anyone who likes Jersey Shore/ Snooki, people who are obsessed with celebrity gossip, the willfully ignorant, intolerance, people who like Miley Cyrus... I could go on forever... 




 I walked into a Books-A-Million and asked where the Faulkner books were. The worker looked at me completely serious and asked who Faulkner was... I walked out. So, who knows what schools are having people read now! 




 Some times you have implantation bleeding a few weeks after the sex. Some girls confuse it for a period 




 I would say you would be suffering from PTSD. I'm sad to say, you might have to deal with this your whole life. A good support system is a great way to handle it. From your post it seems you have good communication with your current boyfriend, so he most likely understands. Try to talk about why you feel that way and work from the core out! 




 I think that only time can lead to feeling comfortable in a relationship if a partner has an... interesting sexual past. It's self preservation. Sadly, I think, still, people are judged so easily by what they chose to do in private. It's still that taboo subject. Maybe if we brought it more out in the open and stopped shaming it, people would be judged less because it takes the secret out of it. I'm not in favor of flaunting, but civil, mature conversations is one of the few ways we can overcome this. 




 The book that has stuck with my is Loose Girl: A Memoir of Promicuity by Kerri Cohen. It really makes you think about why people act the way they do, and not to judge people by their sexual history. I have to pick it up once a year and re-read it. Anytime I see some one (boy or girl) acting in a promiscuous way, I think of that book, and it reminds me that despite their actions, he/she is a person and deserves respect (reasonably) and might just need some one to be in their life consistently. 




 Thank you! I really don't know where I would be without them! 




 It's ok to be upset. As long as, it isn't affecting your relationship. I've been with my boyfriend for about 7 months, and I still call him by my exes name sometimes. It's because he spent time with said ex and needs to get used to having someone new in his life. Just remind yourself that she's his ex, and he loves you now! :)! Hope I could help! 




 My mom isn't a Harry Potter fan, but I always bonded with my step dad over it. After he passed away, she helped me organize a Harry Potter Marathon in his memory with close friends and then bought me the Wizarding Collection despite the high price. Now we are going to the Harry Potter theme park (my last vacation with my step dad), and she's taking my boyfriend with us for support in case I can't handle being there.
