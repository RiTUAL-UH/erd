 I can't really see the Greeks wanting to be that rude about the Canadians though..... 




 I bought some wood by the metric foot last week. Gloriously archaic :-) 




 Yup, this is kinda why I've never understood the hang up that people have over the licence fee. If you assume its a mandated tax (it isn't, but hey...) then it's some of the best value you'll ever see for that money.

Personally, I see no reason to pay for satellite or cable - I'm not a big TV watcher anyway and find that nearly everything I enjoy watching comes from the BBC anyway, so I don't see the point in paying for a much wider range of stuff I don't want to see anyway.

Check out Luther or The Escape Artist, both of which are excellent drama series. We're also enjoying The Paradise, which is a more traditional costume drama on its second series now.

There's also a convincing argument that Sherlock is worth the licence fee all on its own... :-) 




 Yup, regions that don't pay the licence fee watch ads to help fund more telly. I have no problem with this. Same with the BBC's web content, I believe.

But on home turf, its strictly non-commercial and this is how it should be. I hate ads and 150pa is a small price to pay to be shut of them.

Interestingly, most Sky subscribers pay 2-3x as much and still get ads on every channel's. This seems a much stranger situation to me... 




 Operation Ouch on CBBC is worth the license fee on its own...well so the kids tell me anyway ;-) 




 Not in Blighty it doesn't. Check your facts please. 




 I enjoy quality programming from the BBC and don't like to watch adverts. 

I'm sure you can make a sustainable TV network without a license fee (note: it's not a tax) but it means watching 20 mins of ads per hour of TV. Oh, and still paying more than the license fee cost to a cable provider for the privilege to watch them.

Thanks, I'll stick with the Beeb. 




 What a bucket of bilge. 




 It would be easier to change the moon's orbit than to move the wife from Waitrose, I'm afraid.

Good queuers there too, BTW ;-) 




 Thank you. It's a strange thing, but if you asked them, I'm sure most customers would also be proud of it.


We Brits can be a strange bunch, but you can always spot us shaking our head at "5 queues for 5 tills" when travelling abroad. It just doesn't happen here...we'd automatically and without a single word being said, create a single master queue feeding all 5 tills in a fair and equal way.

Love it :-) 




 Fair point, but typically the frier cooks the food and neither serves it nor takes payment. He does however accept the initial verbal order ("two large haddock and a battered sausage please, mate") so he can be getting them in to cook while you're properly ordering and paying.

Most decent chippies have an order taker, a wrapper and a frier. 




 My local chip shop (Leeds, UK) has a very strict queuing system:

1. Enter shop. Place order with frier who starts cooking it immediately.
2. Walk straight to till, place order and pay
3. Walk to back of queue.
4. Wait.
5. You are served strictly in order and the best part is that while you're queuing you're food is being cooked, so you're not really being held up
6. Collect food and enjoy it.

Efficient, brutally fair, and all freshly cooked. I've been to many, many chip shops and found few that work like this. I've also found none that serve better food and cope with a lot of customers so efficiently. Shops that don't work like this actually make me stressed!

Queuing is culturally embedded in Britain and I'd have it no other way. 




 Give me back my fortress, you bastards! 




 I loved ad d (note username ;-) but my heart still lies with Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (way before the battle stuff) and, even earlier, the wonderful Dragon Warriors series. I enjoy fantasy because of these two wonderful series.

Not sure how much light they saw outside of blighty though.

Love em still :-) 




 As a parent of two (5 and 7), I still read to them every night. For the eldest, we mix it up between me reading to her, her reading to me and her reading by herself, but neither of us is quite ready for me to stop reading to her - after all, it's fun :)

Stephen Fry reads Harry Potter to us all when travelling in the car. Does this count? 




 Yup, and that's also why they don't take off planes noise to tail. If they did, following aircraft would hit turbulence caused by the previous take off... which may be very serious indeed.

Check "wake vortex" for more info. 




 Indeed. Although when you realise that you've left your phone, the first thing you do is....reach for your phone!

In my case, I'd been dropped at a hotel so ran inside and borrowed the concierge's phone to quickly call mine. It just rang out and I started to panic then looked out of the window to see the cabbie waving at me from the drop off area.

Shock news! Most people aren't arseholes! (Well, ones in the real world anyway ;-) 




 I left my phone in a London taxi. After realising I'd done so, I called the number and the friendly taxi driver drove back and returned it, earning himself a nice tip.

The end :) 




 Wireshark. Unquestionably the most useful tool in any IT admins tool bag.

Not free, but I'd rather use a Mac than be without ALTAP Salamander. Any two pane file explorer would be better than nothing though :-) A few people mentioned windirstat, but the functionality is baked right into AS so I never miss it :-) 




 Fair comment on 3 hour play, but on a 30 minute sitcom...? 

The ideal format for a 30min TV programme is no bloody adverts at all! 




 It's really sad, but kinda inevitable, that the first and most earnestly discussed point of this thread is the cost of treatment. Coming from the UK, it seems /so/ strange that this should be so.

This is a really odd question, but what would have happened if you weren't insured? Would the medical system really have refused your son treatment because of something as silly as ability to fund?

Anyway, don't want to detract from your original post. Sincere wishes for a speedy recovery. 




 :-) 




 Rubbish!

A carefully, well reasoned argument there ;-) 




 Dunno, 30k miles a year, means you'll probably have done 1/2 a million by then.

The point is that cars kill kids. It's a shame, but it's the truth. Just at the point kids are at their most headstorng and at their least likely to listen to adults, we give them a 2 tonne killing machine and say "there you go, knock your socks off".

Kids think they are great drivers. They are not. They are rubbish. And they need this hammering into them. Realising that you are a rubbish driver is probably the one thing that will keep you alive long enough to stop being rubbish. 




 He's in high school. When he's got a dozen years and a few hundred thousand miles under his belt, I might revise my estimate. 




 Sorry, my friend, but he did noone a favour that day.

1. You were a rubbish driver
2. You were well over the speed limit
3. He effectively told you to "carry on, sonny"

This time you were lucky. Next time your inexperience might kill someone. 

Cop FAIL. 




 Check the in car footage from Nando's and Hamilton's cars - it was a pretty dangerous move from both drivers and a reprimand was a fair penalty.

Tough luck on Webber that 3 in a year means an automatic penalty, but them's the rules and it's hard to argue with them (even though, personally, I thought it about the best part of the race :-/ ) 




 you're a cunt if you only tip 10 percent

Or not from the US... Tipping 30 or 50% of the meal cost? Mental! 




 Couple of things to note:

1. I always start out writing a select statement that returns the rows that I want to modify, and then changing it to an update. Paranoia always wins :)
2. MySQL has a not well known startup flag that disables unqualified delete or update statements (i.e. where you've forgotten the "where" clause). Amusingly, it's "--i-am-a-dummy" :)

Otherwise, this made me spit my tea on my keyboard. Certainly, an IT guy's idea of horror - give me hairy monsters and vampires any day! 




 A "Glasgow Salad" aka chips :-) 




 I Am The Resurrection - The Stone Roses

Anything else and you're not thinking straight ;-) 




 My wife has had ITP for the last 3 1/2 years after she started bruising for no reason. Her platelet count dropped down to  10k when she was first admitted and bounced around for a couple of years, following her various treatments.

We've managed to avoid any serious interventions (it's /always/ possible to drag your feet instead of going under the knife!) so it's really been an inconvenience rather than a serious illness. As her doctor said to her: "You're ill, not dying."

For the last 12 months she's stayed above 30k unaided and has managed to avoid any trips to hospital for IVIG and, even better, she's just started mountain biking again (with a helmet!)

Best of luck to you and, from my experience as a partner of a sufferer, please remember not to let it own your life - even if it never goes away, you can live a more or less normal llife. Oh, and don't be too quick to have bits chopped out ;-)

Hope the financial aspect is OK for you. We're UK based, so at least we don't get a bill at the end of each month! 




 Considering offering your seat on the underground to a "pregnant" woman?

Remember: It's always better to see a pregnant woman stand than a fat girl cry...
