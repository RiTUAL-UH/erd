 Cliche? It only happened twice. 














 I have a feeling most of the accusations of child abuse are based on child pageant tv shows and not on studies.

 The movie is Garden of Words and the setting is Shinjuku Gyoen in Tokyo. 









 Welcome to the Space Show. 




 RahXephon's "My Blue Friend" episode had me all teary eyed. 




 This is the Kamishikimi Kumanoimasu Shrine in Japan. I first saw it as the setting for the movie [Hotarubi no Mori e](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grTUkLgHwGM).

 The Rubinsky and Terran plots could have been done better towards the end. They were intriguing plots initially but by the fourth season they lost a lot of steam and didn't add much tension. It felt tacked on just to add some conflict.

Improvements in animation and ship design would also make the show better. Just imagine Walter von Schenkopp fight scenes with better animation and a bit more flare.

 Steins;Gate, Bunny Drop and Space Battleship Yamato 2199. 




 Mir should work on his clinch game or just avoid the clinch altogether. Big Nog (2nd fight), Cormier and Carwin also bullied him in the clinch. 




 Leg extension, glute kickback machine and hamstring curls. 














 Bicyclists in NYC run the red light all the fucking time. I wouldn't even feel bad if I witness one of them run a red light then get hit by a bus. 




 No. His PB is 13.46 the 6th best time in the final is 13.43.

13.46 is not even a good enough time to qualify an American hurdler into the Olympics since America has quite a depth of talent in that event. For example the top three times in the 2012 USA Oympic trials are 12.93, 12.98 and 13.08.

 Bro Love: The Fight 




 Or he scored the first round a 10-7. 




 Everyone's screaming about 30-25 but the 30-27's are bad too. How those judges did not score round one a 10-8 is mind boggling. 




 Two knockdowns and some beat downs in between those knockdowns, yeah pretty much a 10-8 but you never know with these judges. 









 Go home and be a family man.

 This is such bullshit. [Invincible heroes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero) are frustrating to watch. 




 Oh shit, Legend of the Galactic Heroes reference.

Best quote:

"There is only one Reinhard von Lohengramm, and there is only one man whose name will be remembered for killing him. Who wants to be that man?" 














 She would be better off using that plate for weighted pistol squats. 














 Good thing I'm sitting down and avoided being staggered. 




 Looks like something Stefon would recommend. If you're looking for fine dining then look no further. Tokyo's hottest restaurant is Loony.

 NFL TV deals are nationwide. The league itself signs those deals with CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN then redistribute some of that money to the teams. In the NBA and MLB the TV deals are regional. The team itslef negotiate those deals, not the league, which makes revenue sharing difficult because teams are looking out for their own. 




 [Wolf Children](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Children). 









 It made me feel so many emotions; joy, melancholy, sympathy, worried and relief. 



















 Pistol squats. Doing weighted pistols for 3x8, one leg at a time is freaking exhausting. 




 For those unaware, Shinkai also wrote a manga and a novel adaptation. The manga has great extensive character development on Kanae, Akari and Risa. IMO the novel has a better depiction of adult Takaki than the manga and the movie.

[In the novel adult Takaki wasn't that hung up on Akari, some memories and feelings would pop up but he didn't hold on to them like he did in the manga and the movie. He even admitted to falling in love with other women. But being heart broken at such an early age seemed to have left a lasting mark on him which led to him giving up on relationships when things get tough.](/spoiler) 




 It had a happy ending but what stuck out the most was the sad part. The scene where Asuna was running on the shallow river really got to me. 




 [] (/s "You've got to keep in mind how old they were and their situation. They were just thirteen, dealing with such strong emotions at such a young age could make one apprehensive and scared. Add the fact that they were about to move away from each other which makes expressing their feelings even more difficult. I think most adults would have trouble with the same situation.")

[] (/s "As for keeping in touch, they did try but the letters/texts were just not enough. The manga went over this really well, they both just shied away from the difficulties the distance provided. It's hard to expect two teenagers to try their best to make a long distance relationship work.") 




 I rewatched it a couple of days ago and I had to close that youtube link only a few seconds in.

 I recommend reading the manga also. Perhaps read it prior to rewatching the movie. The manga has added dialogue and scenes that does a great job of developing the characters better than the movie which also makes it all the more depressing.
