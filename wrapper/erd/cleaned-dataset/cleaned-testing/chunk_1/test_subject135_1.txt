 By relatively cheap I mean under $2,500. 














 It's not a perfect book. The mystery is actually the weakest part of it and the main character, Claire DeWitt, can be a little off-putting, but the whole thing is so unusual, mystical, thought-provoking, richly evocative of post-Katrina New Orleans and even occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, that I thought I'd give it a rec.

It's vaguely reminiscent of The Boy Detective Fails by Joe Meno, so I'm going to give that a mention too.

 You'll often hear people say something like "I (or a friend) doesn't really like reading, but I like book X." I think of these books as "books for non-readers" and I was wondering precisely what is it about these books that appeals to non-readers in a way that other books don't? 

Also, is a book that appeals to non-readers similar to books that I call "brain candy" -- books that are light and fluffy and silly and require no brainpower to process at all, mostly romances but not necessarily?

Your thoughts? 




 It seems to me that a lot of SF and fantasy today engages in excessive worldbuilding to the extent that plot and character development almost take a back seat to description. The most notable example of course is Harry Potter and I think this is the reason why when people finish certain SF or fantasy books they wish for more is because the worldbuilding is amazing but the meat of what a book is supposed to be is lacking.

By contrast, things like LOTR, Star Wars (the movies, not the expanded universe of books), WoT and GoT do not have such extensive worldbuilding. They tell a story and when it's finished, it's finished, and you feel satisfied with it. "I wish WoT was 20 books longer" said nobody ever.

Conversely, Discworld has fairly extensive worldbuilding but you also feel satisfied at the end of most books because Terry Pratchett is great at telling a story and giving you interesting characters. 

Edit: Now that I think about it some more, I see that I can't name as many series off the top of my head as I thought I could. My memory's been influenced by the many threads bemoaning the fact that people can't get enough of X or Y world that must make it seem more common than it is. But the point still stands that it is entirely possible to engage in excessive worldbuilding to the detriment of the characters and story. 









 As I was reading it, I felt like Mr. Mercedes was Stephen King's answer to the Cuckoo's Calling. When a character named Trelawney popped up, that confirmed it for me.

I think that Mr. Mercedes was the better book. Though Cuckoo's writing was a bit smoother -- some of the dialogue in Mercedes was eye-rollingly bad -- Mr. Mercedes worked better as a mystery. Stephen King uses all the conventional techniques and even comes up with a couple of new ones, while Cuckoo came across like Rowling didn't know the first thing about conducting an investigation. And while the characters are a bit silly in Mercedes, at least they're vivid. As soon as I put down Cuckoo, I couldn't even remember how the mystery got resolved, let alone anything about the characters.

I read that the Silkworm is better than Cuckoo and a sequel to Mr. Mercedes is coming out next year, so I'm hoping they both will be improvements.

 In other words, not that it was touching or sad because somebody died or something like that. And not crying because you were laughing so hard.  




 Not the best characters or plot but the prose itself?

 There are some authors who were turning out decent books up until they died and some that seem to have run out of ideas but keep churning them out anyway. Who do you think should retire or should have retired from writing? My answer in the comments. 









 First the good. Besides for the utterly boring first 70 pages and the weak, college freshman essay last 70 pages, most of the middle was fairly engrossing. Also, I laughed a couple of times.

Now for the bad. It was engrossing, but not good. The writing was weak and unedited, as judged by the spelling errors and inconsistencies, and by the plot errors and inconsistencies. She repetitively described New York using an overabundance of banal and seemingly randomly-chosen adverbs. 

The main character, Theo Decker, is a cypher. He tells us what he's feeling, but we never quite feel it ourselves. He doesn't particularly have much agency either. He mostly allows himself to get dragged around by whatever dynamic person who's around at the moment. 

The plot is incredibly weak and relies heavily on having a death every 200 pages to advance the story and/or a Dickensian coincidence. In fact, toward the beginning of the book, I was sure that this had to be a parody of Dickens, it was that bad. Later it seemed to be a bit of a Harry Potter AU fanfiction and when Theo's friend Boris starts calling him "Potter" and does so for the rest of the book, I felt entirely vindicated. There also a lot of retconning. She wrote the book over a period of 11 years and I think it shows. 

It's too bad the book didn't end with Theo successfully committing suicide. Then it might have been compared to Shakespeare or Greek tragedy and would be more meaningful for it. Instead we're treated to a long and pointless essay about art, which does nothing to life the book from its mediocrity. In 770 pages it says absolutely nothing original or insightful about art, humanity, or anything else. I am completely baffled why it won the Pulitzer. 

One positive review I read started with something like "I can't explain how much and *why* I liked the Goldfinch so much." If even people who like the book can't explain what they liked about it, it can't really be all that good. It might be appealing, but appeal and quality are not particularly correlated.  




 It's really supposed to be Burn, Read, Rewrite, but I don't believe in burning books, even for fun.

 I went shopping for Fathers' Day cards and by the end of the week almost all the "for father from daughter" cards are sold out while most of the rest are going strong. Who decides what cards to stock? Don't you think they'd notice from year to year which cards are the most popular so they'd stock more of those than the rest? Sometimes I wonder the same thing about milk in drug stores, but my guess is that milk is a loss leader so they don't care too much about that. But greetings cards are expensive!  




 There's a story behind this question but I can't remember what it is.

 When the critics like a movie a lot more, most likely it's artsy and a little dull. When the audience likes it more, most likely it's a dumb crowd-pleaser.

But what does it mean when critics and audience members like it about the same? 
























 It's a children's book that probably wasn't published later than 1985. It was about a boy that had a paper route but for some reason wasn't able to do it so his sister took it over despite the fact that people didn't think a girl could do it. I think I remember her having trouble collecting money from the people she delivered the papers to, and there was a dog, a chow, that bothered her and drooled a lot. 




 Any thoughts? Is it similar to any other Russian novels? Is it a difficult read?

 Like how the first two books in Divergent are written from Tris's perspective, the last book is written from Tris and Four's perspectives. Or Narnia, where some of the books aren't even about the same characters.  




 I originally [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2191s4/amateur_shelf_reading/) about my amateur shelf reading in /r/books because that's where I learned the term, but apparently nobody there was interested, so I decided to give you guys a shot.

Last week I did some shelf reading at my library and found a bunch of misshelved books (see previous thread). I decided to do it again this week, but I only managed to get through three shelves on one bookcase because a library worker started hovering around and I felt self-conscious. 

So now I'm wondering if somebody noticed the post or they noticed the books I'd left to be properly shelved and had the brainstorm that maybe people who actually work there (whether as employees or volunteers) should actually be doing it? If so, it's really awesome that I made an impact.

This week I looked at Par- to Patterson. Most of the misshelvings were relatively minor, though I did find a Sarah Pekkanen in there.  









 If so, what book(s)? Or author(s)? 




 Plot summary from Wikipedia:

Five of St Aubyn's novels, Never Mind, Bad News, Some Hope, Mother's Milk, and At Last, form The Patrick Melrose Novels, republished in a single volume in 2012. They are based on the author's own life, growing up in a highly dysfunctional upper-class English family, dealing with the deaths of both parents, alcoholism, heroin addiction and recovery, and marriage and parenthood.

They're sort of depressing and nihilistic at times, but the prose is clever, funny, easy-to-read, and thought-provoking. The best books are the first and fourth, which are written from a child's perspective. 

The other books are weak (especially the second, which comes off like a re-written Bright Lights, Big City, and the third which barely seems to have Patrick Melrose in it at all) but despite how much you pity but also despise Melrose, you feel compelled to follow him on his journey. 

The last book is a bit old hat, like the author ran out of new things to say, but it ends on a high note that doesn't lie and say that everything *is* okay, but that it very well might be okay, after all this time, finally. So you feel glad that it really is possible to transcend even the worst kind of childhood and upbringing.

Highly recommended for people who are interested in the subject matter, particularly the British upper class.  









 How do you go about renting an apartment without a real estate agent? Aren't all the listings in the newspaper or Craigslist fake or get snapped up the day they're listed? 




 After the discussion last week about shelf reading and my admission that it was unlikely that I would ever formally volunteer at the library, I decided to do some shelf reading on an amateur basis. It was pretty gratifying and I intend to do it again.

I did this during my lunch hour so I only had time to look over two bookcases. The books ran Sta- to Stevenson. In the two cases I found minor misshelvings such as SteiNberg ahead of SteiMberg; SteelE ahead of Steel; a book of essays that nobody seemed to realize was non-fiction and will probably be misshelved for the rest of its poor little life (because good luck trying to convince a library worker that it needs to be reclassified); some slightly worse misshelvings such as Strohmeyer; also Inferno by Dan Brown. 

Yup, Dan Brown. In the S's. 

Can't wait to see what'll turn up next. 

ETA: There were other errors but I don't remember them all. Some misshelved books I put in the right place, others I left out depending on how easy it was to find where they really belonged. 




 I hope this is okay to post here; I figured you guys would be more familiar with plays than other subreddits.

(Background) I was writing a story that suddenly occurred to me would work better as a play, which is bizarre because while I've written a number of (unpublished) novels and took a couple of stabs at writing a screenplay, I've never been particularly interested in plays before. Plus, I've read plays, but I haven't seen too many performed.

(Question) So, what is your take on telling a story in a novel versus a play versus a movie format? Is there a particular type of story that lends itself to one format over another (aside from the obvious like action movies couldn't be plays)? What is the selling point of a play?

(Also) Would anybody be able to recommend to me plays with approximately five characters?

 Maybe the question doesn't really make sense, but I couldn't figure out how to phrase it better. Lately I feel like I've been reading two books around the same time that have nothing to do with each other but funnily have similar aspects or elements.

For example, Friday I read Where'd You Go, Bernadette by Maria Semple, which is a modern-day domestic dramady set in Seattle, and Saturday I finished The Abominable by Dan Simmons, which is a historical drama/thriller largely set in England and Mount Everest. But both books have a connection to Antarctica. 

I didn't read these two books together on purpose, in fact I didn't know that Antarctica figured into Where'd You Go, Bernadette -- I took it out from the library without even reading the book jacket. 

Has this happened to you? 




 Has been writing for a long time and/or has written a lot of books, and the opposite. 




 Seems they're trying to prevent people from crossing from the middle of the street, except I didn't see it stopping anybody but me because I was afraid the traffic agents would give me a ticket -- except they weren't paying any attention to what people were doing. (Do traffic agents even have the authority to give people tickets?)

Theoretically this is a good idea because far too many people cross when the turn signals are green and I'm amazed that nobody's gotten run over in front of me yet, but at the same time, the way this intersection is set up, if you wait to cross legally to get to the train station, you'll be waiting for much longer than if you cross in the middle. There should be a legal diagonal crosswalk light. 

I'm pretty annoyed right now.

ETA: And now they've added a big flashing sign saying not to cross, to use the crosswalks. Like, duh, as if people don't know that. But the traffic agents are gone.

 I'm reading Blue Has No South by Alex Epstein. It's a book of really short stories, flash fiction, I guess. I'm finding them incredibly hard to understand. Here's one story. What do you make of it?

The Man Who Lived in an Elevator

In his last years in the elevator old age had disposed of his hair (in the mirror he saw the reflection of a caveman whose hair was turning white). His children, who were ashamed of him, used to stop him on the lower floors and give him pictures drawn by his grandchildren.

 There was a recent thread that had a list of classic heroines and one of them was Katniss. The Hunger Games was published in 2008; it cannot possibly be considered a classic yet.

I was thinking that a book can't be considered a classic until it's been in print at least 20-30 years. In other words, it needs to be read a generation after it was published. (50 or 60 years would be even better -- two generations after it was published.)

And if you want to talk about a series, it's 20-60 years after the *last* book was published, not the first.

Your thoughts? 




 I remember a softcover science fiction novel that was probably published in the late 1980s or early 1990s. It had something to do with cat people and for reason, I'm thinking tea. I think the author's last name was toward the beginning of the alphabet.  









 I find that I prefer Russian, Japanese, and Spanish over French and German. Maybe it's the subject matter, maybe it's the translations or maybe it's the quality of the original languages themselves, I don't know.  




 You don't have watched them when they originally came out, only that you watched them when you were a kid. (Star Trek original series, 1966-9, Star Wars trilogy, 1977-83, Battlestar Galacica, 1978-80) 




 And by women's novels I mean stuff by people like Maeve Binchy, Elin Hilderbrand, Jodi Picoult, Fannie Flagg, etc. -- relatively serious books about women's lives.

I do not mean chick lit like Bridget Jones or the Shopaholic series. I also don't mean romance of any sort, whether hardcover or paperback.

 This past week I read Life After Like by Atkinson and First Sight by Steel and I rated them very similarly (3/5 stars and 3.5/5 stars respectively). 

Atkinson's book is ambitious, creative, and fairly-well written, but overall it's just not that good. The characters and relationships aren't engaging, the basic story has been done to death, and the most creative aspect of it didn't pan out in the end.

Steel's book is pretty bad, actually. It's a dumb romance, dumb characters, fairly bad writing. Though there were a couple of plot twists that I genuinely did not see coming and that's what kept me from rating it lower.

So in the end, I slightly preferred First Sight because I wasn't disappointed by it. I knew what to expect and pretty much got it. To me it feels worse to have my hopes dashed by a book that turns out to be overhyped. 

How do you feel about books that don't live up to the hype versus mediocre bestsellers that do what they're supposed to do? 









 I'm looking for creative ways of including movement/exercise in my day. I have a 9-5 desk job and overall I'm pretty sedentary. Currently I walk at least a quarter of a mile every day and stand at least an hour a day, on average.

I was browsing through this and other health subreddits and I saw one suggestion of sitting on an exercise ball. I like that idea and I'm looking for others like it -- easy to incorporate into my daily life but aren't totally obvious.

 Inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1kxsut/goodreads_drama_what_do_you_think_about_rating/) post about rating a book you haven't read. 

How do you feel about someone writing/posting a negative review of a book that they deliberately haven't finished because they didn't like it?

Is it fair because not wanting to keep reading a book is a pretty good indication that there's something not good about it?

Or

Is it unfair because maybe if they'd stuck with it, they might have liked it in the end?

Or 

Does it depend based on what they didn't like about it? 

Or

Something else?
