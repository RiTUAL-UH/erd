**Profile**

*Monsters: 17*

* 1 Blaster, Dragon Ruler of Infernos ^(Not just good early game, but late game when my grave is flooded with fire monsters)
* 3 Hazy Flame Cerbereus ^(Searcher and can summon without tribute, can't run less than 3)
* 3 Hazy Flame Hydra ^(Easy to get from deck to field and makes Solda with up to 4 materials for field control)
* 2 Hazy Flame Peryton ^(Weeds out Hydras and phynx)
* 1 Hazy Flame Sphyx ^(Great card to summon while Plague Spreader is in the grave)
* 3 Flamvell Firedog ^(Can summon Cerberus, Hydra, or Magician. All great options)
* 2 Kuribandit ^(Set up the grave and possibly grab a rekindling? Yes please)
* 1 Flamvell Magician ^(Makes Star Eater playable as well as other good synchro options)
* 1 Plaguespreader Zombie ^(This + Hazy = Beelze. Makes sphynx more consistent.)

*Spells: 16*

* 3 Mystical Space Typhoon ^(I've tried less. Didn't run well.)
* 3 Hazy Pillar ^(For maximum consistency.)
* 3 Upstart Goblin ^(Many anti-hoban people will not agree, but it really is needed, and my fields can get massive thanks to rekindling.)
* 3 Soul Exchange ^(A very troll [read: bullshit] card that tributes my opponent's monster for my own summon. Starting a peryton play with this is always satisfying.)
* 1 Onslaught of the Fire Kings ^(3 wasn't working well since I could only summon Cerberus or Firedog. Neither is very good under Onslaught.)
* 1 Rekindling ^(Because I can only run 1.)
* 1 Soul Charge ^(Not attacking is painful, but not being able to set up a field at all is even more painful. Under the right conditions, this could win games.)
* 1 Dark Hole ^(Staple)

*Traps: 7*

* 2 Fiendish Chain ^(Cloggy at 3 since I want to be drawing cards to summon, not just stop 1 monster's effect)
* 2 Mirror Force ^(staple)
* 1 Bottomless Trap Hole ^(staple)
* 1 Solemn Warning ^(staple)
* 1 Torrential Tribute ^(Solda makes me wish I could run 2, but alas, I can only run 1)

*Extra Deck: 15*

* 1 Gagaga Cowboy
* 1 Abyss Dweller ^(Because Mermails)
* 3 Hazy Flame Basiltrice ^(Great card when consistently starting out large)
* 1 Evolzar Solda ^(Too good with Hydra. Probably should run 2. This + torrential tribute = fun times.)
* 1 Photon Strike Bounzer ^(Haven't used him at all)
* 1 Ptolemy M7 ^(Sometimes really good to get back a peryton and do another powerful play)
* 1 Gaia Dragon the Thunder Charger ^(Really good fit for when I have no better use for a 0-m basiltrice.)
* 1 Vulcan the Divine ^(Won me a few games when I just couldn't find away around certain stall cards. Fire Attribute for Blaster)
* 1 Stardust Dragon ^(Dragon-type for Blaster with good effect)
* 1 Scrap Dragon ^(See stardust dragon)
* 1 Crimzon Blader ^(Fire Attribute for Blaster with good effect)
* 1 Beelze of the Diabolical Dragons ^(See Plaguespreader Zombie)
* 1 Star Eater ^(Must I say it? I think this is a great card to have dispite being situational upon 2 cards of which I run only 1 of each.)

Looking for serious suggestions based on how the meta is doing. Considering anything for side-deck since it's purely experimental and I'm not committed to any of it.

We first narrowed it down to 5 based on preliminary performance. Then down to 3 based on our least favorites. Then we graded each one on different criteria such as creativity, believability, performance, fun, potential as an anime deck, etc. These two were practically neck and neck the entire time.

The Deck with a good backstory and ultimately some fun and unusual dragon mixing came out on top. Is it just coincidence that when tested against each other, Gem-Knights also won?

---

**Winners!!!**

P:M me soon and tell me if you'd prefer packs of Premium Gold or Dragons of Legend. Remember to leave me your shipping info there as well. Must warn you that PGLD packs will take longer to get. (They're vastly overpriced at locals, so I'll have to wait for either Wal*Mart or Target to have them in stock.) 




 I've come across an iPhone 5 that's connected to Sprint's network that I'd like to get unlocked, but it doesn't seem like any googling can get me a guide or service that can actually do it for a Sprint phone. 




 For anyone who was wondering, no, this contest has not been abandoned. We have just a few more decks to go through. It's hard when we often cannot find enough free time between all of our team members. The prizes are still has follows:

1st place: choice of 2 packs of PGLD or 2 packs of DRLG.*

2nd place:  choice of 1 pack of PGLD or 1 pack of DRLG*

*note: PGLD prize may take a long time to arrive since everyone nearby seems to be out of stock. 




 If you have not submitted your Anine Deck directly to me, then sorry, you will not be entered. My birthday passed last Tuesday, so the submission period is finally over. Team Two toes is working hard to rebuild all of your entries on DN for review and testing.

Again, we are judging based on how well the deck is put together and how believable it is that we might see the deck in the anime, as well as which ones we like personally.

Boy did we get quite a few lights worn and chaos entries. Because of this, we will not allow two decks of the same category to place for a prize. If it so happens to be voted as such, we'll only take the one that was entered sooner.

Thanks for your submissions everyone.

Also, PGLD at my locals jumped to over 20 dollars to purchase. Target and Wal Mart don't seem to be of any help. Winners will have a choice to take Dragons of Legend packs instead so I can distribute prizes faster. Later, I'll update this post with a list of all qualified entrants. 



















 I have a stage I want to use in my stage expansion, but the camera is annoyingly close to the players the entire time. Is there anyone who can point me to a guide that will help me fix this problem? 









 **These Guidelines are temporary**

Any complains or comments about these guidelines should be commented on in this post.

Please follow these guidelines strictly until we're done finalizing them. Failure to do so will result in a temporaray ban from /r/YGOSales only. Further non-compliance will result in a permanent ban across /r/YGOSales and its related subreddits.

**[Guidelines can be found HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOSales/wiki/guidelines)**

From now on, the initial submit button will take you to these guidelines to remind you of our rules.

Also, some of you haven't been assigning your own flair. This is not the moderators' job. It takes 3 seconds. Posts over an hour old without link flair will be taken down immediately. 




 So, Those who took advantage of it, so what mat did you get?

I got myself a playmat I was planning to get for a long time. I took advantage of the sale to get this [Project M playmat](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/65160123/Playmats/Project-M-Playmat-flat.png)

---

Those who you who missed it, what mat would you have wanted to get?

Also, here's the code I normally use for $2 off a regular order: **INKED10** 




 You can now put a link flair on your posts. THIS IS MANDATORY.

This obseletes the old way of making sure we have a user-written tag on each one. This doesn't just allow our site to look prettier, but it allows you to change from one kind of post to another without waiting 7 days and/or creating a new thread.

Link flairs will help others quickly seeing whether you are buying, selling, or both. Remember to assign this flair AS SOON AS YOU MAKE A POST. It's not that hard, and only takes 3 seconds. 

I have done the front page a courtesy of assigning flair for them, but moderators will not be responsible for adding flair to each post. It is a user's job to distinguish their own posts.

---

If you do not use a pre-approved flair, or forgot to put flair up, a moderator will tell you to assign proper flair. After that, if you still don't assign the proper flair, a moderator is free to remove the post without any further notification.

Soon, I'll be adding sort links to the side-bar so you can easily sort by the type of post you want. 




 **[Binder](http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs)**

**[Misc Cards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsFLBcRk6Sp6dGR2aEVOa2h4cUJVRFZNeDNFbW9VQmc usp=drive_web#gid=0)**

If you want to buy either binder as a whole, I can do it for $20 or a card lot worth $20.

Wants:

* **Paypal**
* Wind-up Arsenal Zenmaioh
* Maxx "C"
* Shared Ride 




 [](/paypal)  
only

**[Binder](http://imgur.com/a/ePOJs)**

**[Misc Cards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsFLBcRk6Sp6dGR2aEVOa2h4cUJVRFZNeDNFbW9VQmc usp=drive_web#gid=0)**

If you want to buy either binder as a whole, I can do it for $20 (cards only) or $25 (cards and Binder). 




 I revised the entire flair system to be a bit more accurate. Don't worry, nobody's flair was "downgraded" and nobody has been "robbed" of feedback or any priviledges related thereof.

**If you're flair is wrong, or you do not have flair because of this new revision, PM me! or message the mods!**. If it's wrong, I'd prefer you message me.

This will be in effect for the next week. 




 I cannot seem to figure out how to make this element appear somewhere else. This is for /r/arryugiohmods. I've tried just about everything. The drop-down menu ends up blocking the very top subreddit that you're subscribed to and I really need to change this if I'm going to make it work.

---

I just figured it out. The proper CSS class is as follows:

    .drop-choices.inuse

In case anybody else is wondering. 




 A recent conflict has brought to my attention the very real possibility that users can be scammed out of hundreds of dollars. I will be planning an overhaul of our safety guidelines and regulations. Until this overhaul can be finalized, please follow these temporary short guidelines.

* No transactions worth over 20 dollars.
* Use tracking on all orders.
* Never use "Friends and Family" in the paypal options.
* Never pay more than half until you get a tracking number.

I don't want mods to become the "bad guys". When I started YGOSales, I wanted it to be a safe place for buying and selling away from eBays unfair share of your hard earned money. As the founder, i do not want the possibility, regardless of how remote, to be seen responsible for undeserving users losing significant sums of their hard earned money. 









 Today, I'm debuting a new feature for the subreddit. These are emoticons. You can use them the same way you would format a [link](http://www.reddit.com). For those of you who have never formatted a [link](http://www.reddit.com) before, you would do it like this:

    [Text here](http://www.fullURLhere.com)

The difference is, you do not have to put a full URL, and you do not have to put text. Simply do the following

    [](/exact-emoticon-name-here)

For example, to use the paypal emoticon:

[](/paypal)

You would enter the following

    [](/paypal)

I'll be working on condensing the formatting on the list of emoticons. For now, simply refer to the sidebar if you forget how to do it.

---

**Of course, with new features come new rules. For now, anyone spamming or abusing emoticons will be temporarily banned**. (This will not apply to the blanket ban across the sister and main subreddits.)

Please use wisely.

VOTE FOR NEW EMOTICONS IN THE COMMENTS!!! 









 Does anyone know of a reliable service for getting a GameCube controller's joystick replaced. My friend he a controller that shorthops whenever the user dashes right. No longer suitable for project m. Yes, we already tried resetting the controller.

I want to use this at locals in a couple weeks. It's what I've been trying to finish along with Airblade Turbo. Each time I look at it, I wonder how I can make it better, but I don't know how.

For locals, I'll need a side-deck that prepares for the following:

* Mermails
* Fire Fists
* Geargia
* Bujins
* Constellars
* Harpies 




 If you haven't seen the last meta post, you can find it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOBinders/comments/21hlql/meta_old_guidelines_new_guidelines_community/). We strongly recommend you read it.

Both /r/ygosales and /r/yugioh101 have implemented a universal link placed right above the tabmenu. (See those subreddits for an example.)

As a user/trader here, what would you like to see above the tabmenu?

*Note:* I cannot make this link user specific. So, putting your own feedback thread up there for personal reference is not possible.

Thanks for letting me know!

 **Intro**

A new anime is coming. And it's called Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V. And as you may have noticed, Yu-Gi-Oh! characters don't exactly play on the level we do. Those powerful cards must be very rare. So I purpose this:

####ANIME DECK BUILDING CONTEST

Let's all build a deck as if we were an anime character in Yu-Gi-Oh! Why not? it will be fun. And there will be prizes.

**IMPORTANT**

READ CAREFULLY

Entries posted here and entries that do not follow the guidelines will be ignored. I'm also receiving a lot of entires that do this

 -monster -monster -another monster -yet another monster -why this monter -why not this monster

Please stop doing these. If I get too much more of these, I will ignore them.

**Rules**

Each deck must adhere to the following rules to ensure that each deck feels like it would be seen in an anime. It will also simulate the rarity of cards in the anime.

* Your deck may have 3 copies of 1 card, and 2 copies of another card. The rest of the cards must be 1 copy each.
* Your deck may have up to 2 Limited cards and up to 2 Semilimited cards.
* April 2014 ban list will be used for this.
* You are free to use any card available to Dueling Network
* You may use either synchros or Xyz monsters, but not both.
* You may use fusion monsters.
* Extra Deck extended up to 20 monsters.
* No side-deck. We will not pay attention to them.
* No custom cards.
* Please,  make it believable that it would be in an anime.

**Submissions**

Submissions start immediately. Go [here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=test_subject1372) and submit a message with both a *Dueling Network Screenshot* and a text list with the *full name of each card* in your deck.

The decks will be judged by Team Two Toes themselves, meaning me, Lily247, and a couple other players from our locals.

The last submission date will be on my birthday, April 29th. After that, Team Two Toes will take up to 2 weeks to judge the decks.

**Prizes**

Since judging is right after my birthday, I'll be able to fund a couple small prizes. Those who wish to fund or donate a prize should PM me. By default, 1st Prize will be 2 packs of Premium Gold (10 cards total). 2nd Prize will be 1 pack of Premium Gold (5 cards total).

Any changes to the prize pool will be announced on April 29th or 30th. At that time, the prize pool will be finalized.

**Example Submission**

^(*Format your submission in the following manner.*)

Character Name: Reiden Lightman

Backstory: My father worked in a factory that helped make the cards, so he snuck me a few. I won a duel disc in a sweepstakes and started dueling outside the factory during my time off for extra money. ^(*Keep your backstories short.*) 









 A buddy of mine I met while pulling from Premium Gold told me that Primal Origins has a few cards that will cause **Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo** to jump in price.

Is there any truth to this? Am I holding onto them for nothing? 




 Right now, I have a neat message for hovering over your karma in /r/ygobinders. But, I can ONLY get the positioning to be the same between firefox and chrome if I set "top:" and "right:" to 0.

    .userkarma:hover:before {
      position:fixed;
      top:0px;
      right:0px;
      display:block;
      z-index:1000;
      width:250px;
      height:83px;
      padding:3px 0 0 50px;
      border:1px solid #333;
      background:#FFF url(%%upstartgoblin%%) no-repeat left top;
      content:"YOU WANT SOME'A THIS?";
      text-align:left;
      font-size:10px;
      color:blue;
      font-weight:bold;
      border-radius:4px;
      -moz-border-radius:4px;
      -webkit-border-radius:4px;
    }

Top and right were meant to be 137px and 4px (respectively) to breifly cover the subreddit information between the searchbar and the "show my flair" textbox. But, when I use 137 and 4, it appears in different places between different users. This happens because one of the accounts I use to test doesn't have the mod mail icon, and the karma field varies in size based on how much karma each user has.

But I need for this to appear in the exact same location to matter what. I'm at a loss.

**For some reason, it just decided to work correctly, and I have no idea what is making it work correctly.** 




 First off, I'd like to thank BBgun69 for the subreddit that is /r/ygobinders and the rest of the moderators for the hours they have poured into this ecosystem.

---

**Breif Rundown**

As many of you know, /r/ygobinders started off as an iota of a trading community vastly overshadowed by trade binders on the main subreddit. At that time, feedback was submitted by all and tracked by one. All in all, it was not a very effective, efficient, or satisfying system.

I started posting here to promote the subreddit because I saw that it had potential. Strangely enough, /r/ygobinders and /r/ygosales began to blossom together when trading on /r/Yugioh was reduced to a single thread per week to cut the clutter. Nevertheless, it is you, the users and traders who keep this going.

You all deserve a thanks for that as well.

---

**Old Guidelines**

I, along with the others, have been working on a newer more streamlined method of presenting basic rules and information to the community. Less digging should be required to find the same information, and we are happy about that, and we hope you are too.

All basic rules are in the sidebar. Each user will still be held accountable to their own defiance of these rules. Sure, concequences may be small in many cases, but nobody has a valid excuse for ignoring them.

Some users may need be reminded that /r/Yugioh and its daughter subreddits are on a blanket ban system meaning a ban on any of these subreddits will earn you a ban on the others as well. These will include:

* /r/Yugioh
* /r/ygobinders 
* /r/ygosales
* /r/ygofeedback

^(Side note: /r/yugioh101 is not officially part of this blanket ban, but has common moderators with a few of the other subreddits and will constitute semi-blanket bans at its own discretion.)

---

**New Guidelines**

Continuous user feedback has allowed us to discuss necessary changes and guideline additions and that will be enforced as soon as they are available on our new [regulations page](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOBinders/wiki/rulesandregulations). Be sure to check that often to keep yourself up to date.

New changes will include but not limited to:

* less cluttered titles
* descriptive, organized, and less lazy descriptions
* shipping cost awareness

Not to mention, we have updates to writings of old articles such as [Scam and Trade Safety](http://www.reddit.com/r/YGOBinders/wiki/scam_and_trade_safety). Don't worry, we are not relying on outdated information. We'll be making necessary updates.

*New*:

I've managed to hide the scores for each post, but we'll still have upvoting and downvoting available for binders. This is the take out the habbit of looking at certain posts or not looking at certain posts based on a high or low number. Thanks to upvotes and downvotes, the best posts and binders will still appear before the rest.

You are *HIGHLY* encouraged to search the "new" tab of this subreddit. Newer posts often don't get immediate attention resulting in decent and quality trades never happening.

---

**User Feedback**

We are constantly encouraging user feedback on all aspects of our subreddit. This ranges from look and feel to stronger enforcement of guidelines. There will always be a button to message the moderators. As well, feel free to line the latest sticky with more feedback.

---

**Closing**

We are a community of traders and Yu-Gi-Oh! players. Remember to respect each other and trade fairly. Once again, I'd like to thank everyone of you, my fellow mods, and BBgun69. This has been a great experience so far.

 Put more clearly, what has someone thought about you for liking my little pony that was unusual or paculiar. I'm looking for the non typical stereotypes such as being old, living with your mother, out of shape, smelly, homosexual, etc.

I've actually had someone ask me about other hub shows like Strawberry Shortcake and Littlest Pet Shop. They were surprised to hear I strongly disliked both shows and asked me why My Little Pony is the "exception" for grown men to watch and not other shows. 









 **Where to Get It**: [Link to Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1vdar4/a_78_stage_build_for_project_m_302_back_and/)

**Build By**: GarbageHead4

This build is very unique. And there's a big reason why. It includes 78 stages. GarbageHead took a classic expansion build of Project M (which included stages from Smash 64, Melee, and Brawl) and now we have this piece of work.

A few gripes I have off the bat to get them out of the way:

* The Music menu is has completely inaccurate stage previews and icons making it hard to adjust anything.
* JCaesar's Menu Music.
* Feint - Homebound music. I'm definitely not going to be using this.
* Incomplete Music information (blank names appearing when round starts).
* Choosing Skyloft on music menu screen causes crash (should find a fix)
* Most icons in Menu music are strike icon (no fix in sight)

Of course, not all of this will count against Garbagehead. It just detracted from the general experience.

There are a lot of stages included in here. Some of them I've seen in other builds, others I haven't. I'll be going over some of the bigger points of some stages later, especially music since music had to be put to each added stage.

* Yoshi's Mountain: Cool but unfitting song. I'd find something better.
* Research Facility: I'd generally recommend staying away from screaming or metal given the very niche fanbase as well as it does not inherently fit well with technological stages.
* Castle Sky: Pretty okay song, but it's metal on a medieval setting, which doesn't fit well.
* SSE Forest: The song was fitting, given the visual context, but it wasn't what I would have picked seeing that it's supposed to be from Subspace, not Zelda.
* Final Needle: Music was well chosen. However, I wouldn't include this stage because it goes from being hard to see to harsh on my eyes. It's very distracting.
* Mewtwo Stadium: I much prefer this version of the stage to the brighter version I see going around. The other version has had shadow errors and wasn't as interesting as this one. Good choice.
* 1337M: Fun stage, but just because a song is titled "King Kong", that doesn't mean it is good for battle or fitting for a DK stage.
* Hyrule Castle M: Great music choice and love the stage.
* Jungle Hijinx: Didn't expect such a fitting song. Girlfriend flipped out like a fangirl.
* Bowser's Castle: Love the music choice. "Bowser's Castle". I once tried a version of this stage with tons of errors, but it's good to see a very well done version of this stage in use somewhere.
* Yoshi's Story M: Great steage, although with thin walls. Has its original Music from the N64 version.
* Summit: Cool flat P:M version with a fitting Metroid Prime song. Shoutout to Metroid Prime fans!
* Spear Pillar: More balanced version of the stage was a nice touch, but the song was uninteresting.
* Aquatic Ruin Zone: The music choice was meh. General remix of sonic sounds. It's called "Green Hill" but didn't sound anything like it. I didn't want to play on that stage anymore after hearing that.
* The Whirl Islands: Really don't like the techno Pokemon love song. It's just... not that good in any sense. This song cause my friends and I to stay off the stage aside from the stage being incredibly huge with little interesting details.
* Magnet Train: I don't understand the music choice. I would have put it on a main Pokemon stage. Not everyone is a Pokemon fan who will know what "Magnet Train" is.
* Venom: I'd take this stage out. It is very boring compared to the Melee original and functions improperly when compared to the Melee version.
* Twilight Realm: Has a remix of Midna's Lament (extremely over-rated song). I would have put in Zant's Theme instead since Zant is actually present in the stage. The High platform causes a balance/camping issue even with the moving platform.
* Dance Party: Great sounding dance song for a great looking well-designed dance stage. I won't spoil the song, but I wasn't expecting to hear what I heard.
* Paper Castle: A lot of Mario stages in thei sbuild. It started to get old. I do like that the Paper Mario Thousand Year Door battle theme was chosen.
* Half Pipe Dream Land: Meh. Music was okay despite being what sounded like a vague remix of Nintendo sounds.
* The Beginning: Good stage choice. Brings smash to its roots. The music was a great choice, but suffice to say, it didn't loope well with itself. I would have found an extended and/or remixed version to put in.

I cannot blame GarbageHead for a lot of this, and nobody should. I would however hold it to Project M fans to test their stages for fun, enjoyability, and noticeable errors. I didn't notice any lag on any stages, so there's that as well. And unlike some builds, there weren't any lighting errors.

The overall quality of the build's stage choices showed through, and I'm glad I can say that.

**Why you might want it**: 78 stages

**Why you might not want it**: 78 stages. It is a con as well. Customizing it could be a bit of a um... hassle. Not all of the stages are very appealing or balanced or fun. Different players will like different stages. I may end up using a derivative of these codes to expand my build with a few stages, although, I'll want everything to look professionally done.

**Would I recommend it and why**: If you like having an overload of stages, why don't you have this build? Get it, customize it, love it, have a blast.

**What about for tournaments**? Definitely not. I cannot see any tournament accepting such a huge expansion without defined neutrals, counterpicks, and casual stages labeled in game.

**Score**: 6/10

It's mostly because of the music menu and some music/stage choices.

I think I'll be taking on [this build](http://www.reddit.com/r/customsmash/comments/1wyx7w/project_w_update/) next. 









 Earlier today I enabled /r/Yugioh101 as a public subreddit to let the posting begin. Small questions and discussions will be up for starting yourself. Bigger scaled discussions can be submitted to /u/DiscussionThreads (link in the sidebar). Articles will go through a mod to prevent multiple articles on the same thing.

We are looking for a lot of budget deck write-ups so just get whatever you have to a moderator. 




 I'd like to thank the 50 and more subscribers who are already willing to learn and teach with others to help the Yu-Gi-Oh! online community grow, flourish, and most importantly innovate. We want to think differently here at Yu-Gi-Oh! 101 with the mindset that EVERYBODY can be good at Yu-Gi-Oh!.

So, some basic guidelines on general posting.

---

**Be Respectful**

If you are harassing others around you and demeaning others opinion, you are not only breaking reddiquette, but you're blatantly breaking our own rules. Do no attempt to make any argument without any elaboration.

**Follow all of /r/yugioh's rules**

This is a cousin of /r/yugioh and as such we will be following most of their posting rules. This includes including text deck lists along with screenshots and allowing room for everyone to contribute.

**Do no post coverage unless it is your own**

We are not here to observe coverage of any tournament experience other than our own. Deck lists and tournament reports etc. will not be welcome here unless it is your own deck list or tournament report. There may be exceptions from time to time, but not without running through the moderators.

**Check /r/yugioh for news and updates**

This subreddit is focused on discussion, friendly banter, and building each other up. Please, by all means, take into account any new cards that may be released soon, but don't post that news here.

**If you're looking for trading or sales, there are subreddits for that**

If you want to trade, you can go to /r/ygobinders. If you want to sell and buy, you can go to /r/ygosales. If you do either, make sure to keep track of your feedback at /r/ygofeedback.

---

That's about everything. If you want to be a writer of on of our official discussion articles, message a moderator and get approval. 









 /r/yugioh101

**I'd like to introduce everyone to what I've been building recently**. We seem to have had a lot of self-hate disappear within ourselves with the dying of certain threads. But we still often see people bummed that R/F and "I'm new" and "getting back into the game" threads still exist.

I figured that if they still exist, then obviously a few links in the side-bar is not helping these players out.

So I founded a new subreddit which not only doubles its purpose of a R/F deck subreddit, but also helps new and returning players ease themselves into the Online community.

---

**THIS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR /R/YUGIOH** and it never will be and it was never intended to be.

The Wiki will have a lot of great information and archives ready to help new players get right in. Anyone interested in helping build these archives or improve need only message me or another moderator.

Speaking of which, if it gets big, we may need moderators. And I'm also looking for a fellow judge or 2 to help me fill in the Wiki's simplified How-To-Play section.

Thanks everyone for your interest.

---

**Features to look forward to**

* Occasional Budget Deck Features
* Simplified How to Play guides
* Tutoring/mentor Program
* Feature of video explanations for those who dislike reading
* User suggestions for other features are welcome.
* Possibly: I'd like to get per-deck communities started where players all playing the same deck can gather around and discuss its strengths and weaknesses. 




 [Mellenium Puzzles](http://i.imgur.com/Zyi26M7.png)

It's an improvement from another entry I did. If I could, I'd switch that entry with this one. But, it is likely that I'll adopt this for /r/yugioh101 and possibly make a green version for /r/ygosales. 




 Here's a game we can all play. Ask some bullshit ruling question or questions in the comments below. Reply to others with a ruling that is also complete bullshit.

---

**This is all in good fun**. Do not ask a serious ruling question. (Feel free to message me about rulings.) Have fun. Keep it one ruling question per comment.

Here's a minor update to my last constellar deck profile. It is still a mixture of your basic build and the +1 engine featured in Joe Boglie's Fire Fist build. Unfortunately, it's going to take me a bit longer to build this since my extra deck was stolen. My friends want to help me rebuild it, and some of /r/yugioh (you know who you are) have been helping too. Thanks.

Any questions or suggestions are very **very** welcome. Please help me improve.

Side deck could really use some help. It's Maxx C; Swords of Concealing; Upstart Goblin; Forced Back; Gozen Match; Shadow Imprisoning Mirror; Mind Crush; Soul Drain.

 My constellar's extra deck got stolen at locals and the cameras couldn't catch anyone. The only camera that could see me was from across the room. Now, I need to get that all over again, and one of those was the Ptolemy M7 that my GF gave me as a gift.

1 gagaga cowboy

2 Constellar Omega (1 ultimate, 1 ultra)

3 Pleiades

1 Ptolemy m7

Volcasauras

Zenmaioh

Our locals judge at least put up some good trades for my judge token (I still have another one), so I have a tiras and paladynamo, and a friend gave me a Volca to help me feel better.

Still have 70 dollars of cards to replace. Wish me luck. 




 My mom's computer, the one I would use to switch builds, is finally and fully dead in the water. I cannot switch builds. Our temporary replacement is old as hell. It doesn't have usb2.0 and cannot wen handle playing a small movie file.

I'm in the market for a USB-SD card reader. Until I get that or a new computer with an SD card reader, I cannot get to reviewing any builds.

I promise, as soon as I can, I will get back to doing more reviews. I'm especially excited for the chance to praise/rip apart that P:M+ build I just saw. 




 https://www.dropbox.com/s/97k7gcn51dvfjks/Photo%20Feb%2015%2C%201%2004%2046%20PM.jpg

Konami sent this as a gift. I'm sure my other two local judging buddies got these as well. I looked on eBay, and they are apparently very scarce and pretty valuable. (Around 50-70.) But I don't think I'll sell them anytime soon.

But look at me rambling on, let's have a bit of casual fun and show off what we've gotten in the mail. 




 Hello. We at /r/ygosales are trying something new. We received complaints about ebay links being a bit annoying. And we've discovered that it is a hassle to go through making a thread for a single card or small group of cards.

If you have something small to sell or would like to leave a link to an ebay auction you're doing, leave it here in this thread. This thread will last throughout the weekend.

Please limit your ebay links to 5 or less. 









 I can't stand this guy. Every day he comes to my house. He looks in through my window. I swear, if he wanted to kill me, he could have done it with a silenced rifle and been done with it. He probably would even get away with it. Nobody appears to have called the authorities to report this guy. He doesn't seem interested in talking to me or getting to know me or even steal anything of mine.

Every morning I look out my window. Sometimes he is already there, but on some mornings, he leaves me alone. Sometimes he will not arrive until I'm about to leave or eating breakfast. I guess it depends on when he wakes up and how long it takes him to get dressed in that redundant suit. It's the same black business suit he always wears. I never see him arrive. I always miss it. He's either there, or he's not.

When I get in my car and open the garage, he appears to be missing. Hiding near my bushes, I presume. They're not too far from where he normally stands. Can't he be more creative? It's not the most sneaky thing anybody has done. I just head to my office with a brisk pace, glad to be rid of him.

My office is on the second floor. No trees outside. I work in accounting with my nose on the numbers, and my numbers on the nose. I'm not bothered until I go out to lunch. I never stay in. No matter where or how far I go, that man seems to find me more often than not. I'm convinced it's not just one man anymore.

He wouldn't come in at all, but watch through the windows instead. Sometimes, when I try using a drive through, I could swear I see him inside about ten feet inside the building. A week ago, I started only going through the drive through. I have my meals in my office now.

End of the day, I'm at home, making dinner, and he is back here behind my tree watching from the outside. He looks a bit different now. He must be stubborn to keep an eye on me, since I keep the blinds and curtains closed now. Every time I peek, he is there trying to look in.

I don't know how nobody else sees this guy. He's at least six feet tall and standing in plain sight. I've started to believe he is part of some government surveillance. They could track me through my phone's GPS, and they could be suspicious of how well the company is doing with my clients. I can't leave my phone anywhere; a client might call me and I could miss something important.

For the love of god, I just want to be left alone. Sooner or later, I'm just going to run outside and attack him myself. Of course I've called the cops, but he's always gone by the time they come, which leads me to believe he's tracing my house calls. The cops refuse to stick around to survey the area since I have no proof.

Does anyone else have a problem with a tall man in a suit staring at you in secret?

This was strongly inspired by the *+1 Fire Fist* build by Joe Bulgli. I thought trying to get a +1 on every turn was a great goal. And since my spell/traps were so similar in Constellars already, I thought that adapting it a bit further might be a good idea.

And for the most part, this deck is pretty consistent. (It still gets those draws with 3 Sombre in the hand sometimes. Thinking about taking two out for Cardcar D or Upstart Goblin.)

I'd like opinions.

**INB4 SOMEONE SAYS "NETDECKER"**

Remember that netdecking is not inherently bad. I have experience running this deck, and I wanted to try running it a slightly different way. I heard different opinions about 1 or 2 bear in the deck, and 3 is completely unexpected, but I have 5 cards to get out the deck with bear, and 3 of those search either another bear or a Kaus.

It's great; I've been able to cycle tenki-bear-tenki-bear until I draw a Pollux or Algeidi that I can use with Kaus.

Also, I used to run the exact same traps in addition to 1 Compulsory Evacuation Device and 2 Dimensional Prison. So that didn't change much. I ran the 3 Tenki, 3 MST, 2 lance before this build came along.

 **Deck**: Dark Worlds

**Archetype**: Dark Worlds

**Cost**: $20-$150

**Description**: The first budget deck feature we have is a polarizing one. By that, we mean you either love and enjoy the deck or despise it with a passion. If you're new to the game, don't worry about this. No matter what deck you play, some players will respect you and others will hate you.

Dark World is an archetype that causes their monster's effects to be activated after being discarded from the hand. A lot of the spells and traps work hard to draw these monsters as fast as possible and then discard them. Their main tools for doing this are **Gates of Dark World** and **Dark World Dealings**.

**Building**: Structure Deck; Gates of the Underworld is a structure deck that comes with plenty of the cards you need to get right into the game. If you buy three, you will have the tools to play around with ratios of certain monsters, spells, and traps. These cost about $20.

If you want to change it up, after buying as many structure decks as you want, buy some traps that are not included with it to make it stronger.

Edit: viewers might like to know that we are a community driven source. This is also just a test/beta post. A different guide will be written to obsolete this one. If you want to write a budge deck feature, submit it directly to a moderator following this format.

My office is on the second floor. No trees outside. I work in accounting with my nose on the numbers. May be hard to believe, but my numbers are always on the nose. No distractions to ruin my day. But, somehow, I always seem to be bothered at lunch. I never stay in. But no matter where or how far I go, that man seems to find me more often than not. I thought that changing my patterns or just eating somewhere different would throw him off. More often than not, he seems to always know where I'm going to go.

He doesn't even come inside the restaurant. He watches through the window. Although, one day, at a drive through, I could swear I saw him inside about ten feet behind the woman who handed me my meal. A week ago, I started only going through the drive through. I have my meals in my office now.

End of the day, I'm at home, making dinner, and he is back here behind my tree watching from the outside. That's how it used to be. It's hard to watch through blinds and thick curtains. Every time I peek, he is there trying.

I don't know how nobody else sees this guy. He's at least six feet tall and standing in plain sight. I've started to believe he is part of some government surveillance. The only reason I could think of them watching me is my recent success with my clients. I get a call from one once or twice a night. It's a relaxing distraction from what's going on. A fifty minute call goes from redundant to a blissful.

For the love of god, I just want this man to go away. Sooner or later, I'm just going to run outside and attack him myself. Of course I've called the cops, but he's always gone by the time they come. And they refuse to survey the area and stick around to see.

Does anyone else have a problem with a tall suited man staring at you in secret? 









 **Hello again.**

test_subject1372 here with another announcement.

In case you missed the previous sticky, ArcaniteMagician is now a head mod, and we're looking for feedback to make this subreddit a better place for everybody.

**So here's what we're working on!**

We have a user working on an upgrade to the GracefulCharityBot to help users quickly get prices to make buying and selling faster and more fun.

Due to user feedback, we are no longer allowing Ebay links in user-created threads. We will be trying Ebay/Quick-Sale threads for those looking to sell individual cards/decks. Please let us know if you would prefer these threads over the weekend or thoughout the week.

I have slimmed down the side-bar to make room for a new section I am planning on for urgent sales. You will be free to message the moderators with a link to your thread and an explanation of your situation. If it is urgent, and you need the money soon, we can keep your selling threads visual for all to see.

I hope everyone will find these changes satisfying. We are always accepting user feedback. There's a handy button on the sidebar for messaging the moderators. 









 **Are you a calabrel fan? Are you Calabrel?**

You're probably going to hate a lot of what I have to say. And I'm sorry I have to start off on that note, but please stay with me and understand where I'm coming from.

**Where to Get it**: http://smashboards.com/threads/calabrels-custom-3-02-project-m-build.346028/

**Build by**: Calabrel

Just from the page, I could tell that this build had a lot of promise. Everything on the front page was kept to a firm standard of maintaining Project M's original stage collisions and camera movements. I guess this was to prevent his build of being banned from tournaments. And it shows. The stages feel great.

All of the changes are even reflected in the stage select screen. What a guy. I love it when I don't have to keep a pen and paper or laptop on me to know what stage I'm picking. Not to mention, page 2 is filled with very competitive stages. This must have taken a long time to do.

^(Side note due to complaints: the stages are mostly remixes of past stages so that it feels tournament friendly. Nothing too interesting outside of the addition of chibi robo stages and music changes to fit the stages. Doesn't do much for the build, but it is satisfying.)

That's almost all the good stuff I have to say about this build. And I'm pretty sure when Calabrel reads the rest, I'll be flamed and probably reported. Nah, he's a good guy, he wouldn't do that. Right?

Anyway, moving on, I have nothing to say about character additions since the fighters are identical to P:M with nothing added and nothing changed. No comments necessary.

But let's talk music. I feel like this was Overclocked remix on parade, and after a while of reading the song names and sources, it got boring. And who wants an entire game to sound so much the same? I did like his replacements over KK Slider's songs. I won't spoil that, so go figure it out yourself.

Starting at the menu, the music changes when you enter the character select screen which isn't necessary and is actually distracting. I said the same in BTBM's build. But let me bring up the music choices. Feint - Homebound was very obvious, and I'm tired of it being used. I also seem to find that intro the Smash Bros documentary, and I'm tired of seeing that in multiple builds as well.

You want to know the reason my build used music from Frozen? I didn't think anybody else would be doing it, it matched the look and feel of my build, and it was a fresh change from the techno and/or rock songs that everyone else seems to be using. On top of that, my choices make great, short menu tracks.

Menu tracks should be around a 50 to 90 seconds, but instead we get bulky files of 180+ seconds for MENU MUSIC. We're not in the menu that often, and it goes quiet after two minutes. A long file is not necessary and shouldn't be used as it takes up a lot of space and won't be heard full through.

Outside of the menu, the music isn't even that bad. There's a lot of OC remix, but it's good music at least. But I can't use this music pack with my friend Luke because he's a music major and will likely only hear noise in certain songs. Calabrel even has a few victory themes. (However, some are far too long, reaching up to 26 seconds. Victory themes should be kept to 10 seconds since most players rush to start a new round.)

It's also good to know I wasn't the only one who thought to put [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaBJpAS29qI) in P:M.

Now let's talk about looping!

The following files are not looped at all

* w15
* w19
* w26
* w27
* x01
* x04

Now let's read a little something Calabrel said.

 Some of it is. I took some of the more obvious ones and looped them.

 [source](http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/1vbn5w/calabrels_302_custom_project_m_build_enjoy/ceqqdvz)

Why didn't he loop everything properly? Fading a song out and having it start over again doesn't count as looping. HAL Laboratories didn't do this, and neither did the Project M Backroom. And what's with the Ballad of the Goddess loop? It's not looped very well, and all he had to do was take a file from a previous version of P:M.

Not to mention, the naming in the game and menu are not consistent. If you want to know more of what I mean, read my [last review](http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/1wpnnu/review_bobby_the_broke_monarchs_project_m_build/).

The music is a drastic shortcoming of this build, and the vast amount of hype and anticipation for this build is just horribly undeserved in my opinion.

---

**Why you might want it**: A plethora of awesome stages.

**Why you  might not want it**: If you take your set to a lot of tournaments, I'd recommend keeping this on a secondary SD card in case your TO doesn't approve. Also, everything I said about the music.

**Would I recommend it and why?**: Yes and No. If you want it, install someone ELSE'S music pack. I'd recommend [mine](http://forums.kc-mm.com/Gallery/BrawlView.php?Number=35478 Vault=audio) or [BobbyTheBrokeMonarch's](http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/1wloz8/btbm_302_custom_build_updated/).

**What about for tournaments?** Get approval from the TO a month in advanced so he/she can let others know that it will be there. The stages might be distracting and throw many players off if they are not used to these stages. If you go to a lot of tournaments, keep this on a secondary (not primary) SD card in case your TO doesn't approve.

**Score**: 6/10

Once I have plans for my next review, I'll let ya know. LEAVE A LINK TO YOUR BUILD TO GET IT REVIEWS. REMEMBER, A REVIEW IS GOOD PUBLICITY.

Edit: GenericallyEpic, I'm coming after ya! A new quota has been build. I look forward to playing more builds. 














 **Where to get it**: http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/1wloz8/btbm_302_custom_build_updated/

**Build by**: BobbyTheBrokeMonarch

I had a subliminal motive with [my build](http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/1wdrdb/project_m_302_build_by_reiden_lightman/) of Project M. I wanted to make something that users would see as a standard for the quality and time put into both full builds and music packages for Project M. A fresh build can be as simple as changing just the common5.pac and mu_menumain.pac for a new visual theme, and some can simply be using codes to add more stages and skins.

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised at the sheer quantity of changes BtBM could list on his build's page. Support for Hackless, Homebrew, and USB methods, new sound bank for the announcer and menu sounds, Apex quality stage select screen, voice banks for more than 10 characters, and plenty more to offer.

While it doesn't ooze of originality or creativity from the start, it does hold up in a bit of professionalism. I see the same professionalism that PMBR insists on when they add new content.

But it isn't without its flaws. Once again, I encounter a music pack that is full of JCeasar's music choices, which we all know are my least favorite. Really, I would never suggest any of JCeasar's choices. At least this time, I could see the changes from the music menu. But, not all stages had music replacements to keep the music fitting. I'm looking specifically at Project M Mushroom Kingdom which still has all the music from Shadow Moses Island. You could imagine how unfitting that sounded.

Also, the naming system was inconsistent. It should be in line with how HAL named their songs in the game. It should just be the song name (unless you plan on changing every single song name in the game to be consistent with your naming system). The only time a source is named is when the song has multiple versions or is a common name such as "Boss Battle" or "Final Boss".

Sources should be in parenthesis (unless, again,  you plan on changing all other names with sources to be in line with your naming system). The purpose of releasing a text list is so those who really want to know can see the sources.

There is one thing that I was thrilled about, and that was porting Skyloft over a different level and modifying the CSS order to keep the first page the same as P:M's official build. This gave Skyloft more music. Hell, I might do this in a minor update to my build.

Sidenote: I did notice that two tracks from Magmoor caverns were my choices as well. I'm assuming this was inspired by my build, and I'm quite flattered.

The second page was filled with some very excellently created stages that feel balanced and up to P:M standards. But some of the names had text that was almost too small to be readable. Some stages had shadows appearing in mid-air, and one stage (Great Bay) prevented AI from fighting back (which was disappointing). At least I didn't feel lag on 1v1 matches. You may experience lag on matches with 3 or more characters, especially if you use the imported character skins.

Speaking of skins, this build uses CBliss to add many more melee skins. Combined with Melee sound banks, this build felt more like Melee than P:M does for brief periods of time.

Melee sound bank you say? What about the announcer?

Yes, he's there, and he feels... inconsistent. None of the Brawl exclusive names were changed which makes it feel like an unfinished project.

---

**Why you might want it**: If you're looking for even more Melee-ified brawl, then this really is a good build. There are more melee alternate skins and plenty of melee sound banks.

**Why you might not want it**: If you're not a fan of JCaesar's music pack or are simply tired of Feint - Homebound being used for menus, or are tired of music packs that are just rock and techno remixes of the original songs, I'd steer away from here. The music changes when you enter the Character select screen which simply isn't necessary. It's distracting.

There were some great sources here, and a lot of it was fitting. But a lot of it felt same-old same-old compared to so many music packs. There's also the issue of the half-done name-calling sound bank. Yes, this is going to continue to be a pet peeve of mine.

**Would I recommend it and why?** Of course. Those looking for support for hackless, homebrew, usb, and forwarder methods have something to gain from this build. Remember to make sure you're using his codeset. This screwed me up at first. Portraits match their skins, which is awesome.

**What about for tournaments?** A lot of these custom skins may throw off some spacing for some players. If you plan to use this at tournament, make sure the rest of the builds are using this too, and announce it a month in advanced to give players time to get used to it. Or, simply disallow these skins (except in the case that both player's agree it is okay).

**Score**: 8/10

Next time, I have a special treat. I'll be spending more time for a review of Calabrel's build (a review I'm taking up by my own request).

I HAVE PLENTY OF TIME PEOPLE. Link me to your builds and let me review them!

Another footnote: I saw that [my build was breifly part of the "popular hacks" section on brawlvault](http://i.imgur.com/mg90GHM.png). Thanks for that everyone who downloaded my build. 




 **Where to Get it**: http://www.mediafire.com/download/9u61fwuakl3b3dv/PM+Custom+Build.zip

**Build by**: SelenHaar6

First off, I knew very little what I was in for. Every build is different, and unlike me, not every build will have the goal of tournament usability like mine does. I'd put this build on the same level my friends make their builds. It feels like it's unfinished, but that's because I'm used to doing more to make sure my build is professional.

The build includes character models, music replacements, and 1 replacement in the info folder.

The characters feel uninspiring. To get the obvious and my biggest peeve out of the way, Cloud is used as a model over Ike. I get it, Cloud is an iconic character for Final Fantasy, but he's pretty damn over-rated considering 99% of casual modders who know about Final Fantasy use Cloud over Ike hacks. I used to be guilty of putting Squall over Ike, so I'm not excused, but I got past my own fanboy services.

We obviously have a huge pokemon fan. Much huger than I can stand for a build like this. In this game, pokemon are already considered more over-represented than the Mario cast. And now the custom skins overload the game with even more pokemon. I spotted so many pokemon skins that I saw a few duplicates from my friend's build.

To make matters worse, the character selection portraits weren't viewable. I had to take more time than necessary to figure out what was going where.

The music was average. A lot of it was taken straight from JCaesar's music pack which so far is definitely my least favorite music pack. Final Destination and Battlefield definitely sound as epic as ever, but everything else feels like a metal version of what used to be there for the sake of sounding hard-hitting and non-Nintendo.

Skyloft, for example, starts off with a metal cover sounding Ballad of the Goddess. I'm pretty sure a lot of people are doing this. Hell, even I used to be guilty of putting a rock cover of BotG on this stage. 

To make THESE matters worse, he obvoiusly knows how to use Brawlbox to change a few text entries. And exporting the music track entries from info.pac allows you to put them right into mu_menumain.pac. It takes less than a minute, and if you're going to release a music pack, you should make the names visible in the menu.

**But I digress**

This is not too terrible of a build. It seems like an average casual build. There's no bugs, glitches, or crashes as far as I can tell. But, remember to defragment the card after you install it. Otherwise, you'll encounter audio issues.

**Why you might want it**: You like lots of music and fighter replacements

**Why you might not want it**: You're competitive and only use builds geared toward competitive play. If you're casual and frequently play with 4 players, you may experience a lot of lag on high polygon stages.

**Would I recommend it and why?** I wouldn't. Not yet anyway. It's clear that SelanHaar6 isn't new to file replacement, but could probably use some help getting Character selection portraits and song names in the music menus to be accurate. If you leave out the fighter package and just use his music, it's a decent music pack that I would probably allow at a tournament since none of the music is distracting.

**Score:** 4/10

Next time, I should be reviewing a build by BobbyTheBrokeMonarch.

Want me to review your build? Leave a comment and P:M me. 









 Well, I've been working on [my custom build](http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/1wdrdb/project_m_302_build_by_reiden_lightman/) for a long time, and aside from cleaning up loops, it's good to be done. I've received some awesome feedback through comments and PMs, so thanks for that. I'll re-upload my build over the weekend for those who really care about the small details.

BUT, as a designer, and just an avid smash player/modder, I wanted to see some other's builds. I have 3 SD cards that I switch between and I keep a master copy of my build on my external HDD. I can afford to see others' builds. If you'd like me to do a review of your build, leave a link to it here.

First come, first serve. Be patient as bigger builds need more time to review.

 Hello everybody. First off, congratulations to Calabrel on his release of his entire Project M build. I've been playing around with it now and again, and I plan to do a written review of it later after I'm done sorting through everything it has to offer.

I did release my current music pack last Christmas in 2013 and I promised an update when I reached an even higher goal of replacements (and even more surprise replacements to find). I've been rearranging a lot of the songs which has delayed the update.

The update will be available both as a download by itself and as part of my full build (which will take far less room than Calabrel's). I'm not, however, planning to do any sort of stage replacements to keep my build acceptable for most small and mid-sized tournaments.

I'd like to give you guys a few videos as previews of what I've managed to find room for in my build. I hope this gets you to look forward to it. I hope you try out my build. If you haven't tried Calabrel's build and you have an extra SD card, I suggest you try that out as well.

 The human minds can remember everything they have seen, heard, smelled, or ever experienced. It's an amazing fact, actually. Our ability to recall differs from person to person. But imagine what it will be like when you can finally recall everything you have ever done. Like when you were born kicking and screaming and still covered in the liquid from your mother's womb. Not knowing what was going on, just screaming in anger and sadness because you weren't comfortable where you were. The air may have been too cold or too hot.

What about the first outfit your mother or father ever put on you. You didn't know what color it was. You didn't associate any sounds or names with what you saw or knew. Talking and making sounds like the others around you was so desirable. If only you could tell them what you were feeling or what you wanted. Until then you scream and yell until your discomfort was handled.

When you said your first words, your parents put it into memory. You weren't concerned with it at all. Did you have fun pretending to recall when you said your first words whenever your parents told you what they were? If you take all of that time, it would equate to about an hour of pretending time.

The truth is, most of us cannot recall anything out of what has been mentioned. It's unfortunate. It would be easier to learn from past mistakes if we could recall anything that we have heard or read or did. History class would be a lot easier. Where is our dedication to remembering? We throw away our memories like candy wrappers for someone else to scoff at.

When did you first pretend or make believe or convince yourself that something was real? I bet you felt completely foolish thinking back on it. Especially if the first pretend idea you had was a boyfriend or girlfriend.

Fast forward through your years and recognize all of your firsts. Oh how so many of them seem so insignificant compared to what you have accomplished. Your first bike, first ride sans training wheels, first game or video game, first phone or cell phone, first graduation. Your parents likely held a plethora of pictures to perpetuate the memories of all of your achievements which now seem like such small stuff. You're on to bigger and better things. Cars, movies, social links, jobs, work, having your own money and being your own person.

If you can recall all of this, it is likely that you have eidetic memory. Or it could just be the knife in your back. 




 I saw a post earlier saying a 3.02 patch was released and that it fixed a couple game-breaking bugs. Now, when I try to download a set, it doesn't download. It just takes me back to the Projectmgame.com homepage. Are the downloads offline right now?

~~If 3.02 is reality, what files do~~ I ~~need to patch over to avoid~~ [have] to redo 4 hours of modding.

IT'S REAL:

CHANGES

 Kirby's Aura Sphere storage bug is fixed.

 Roy's Final Smash will no longer clank

 Flaco's forward smash will now sparkle around his legs instead of his arms.

 Names on the Character Selection Screen have been moved down to their original positions 




 Okay, let's stop it with clogging up this subreddit with alternate costume ideas. I'm pretty sure a lot of us are getting very bored with them. Just post them in here.

(You're welcome)

MAJOR EDIT:

Seriously, guys, be realistic at least. The PMBR says that they are not going to add in any alternate costumes that change who the character is. Butterfly metaknight is still Metaknight. Dr. Mario is still Mario. Mr L is still Luigi. Shadow Peach is still Peach. And so on. Stuff like Skull Kid over Toon Link or Master Chief over Samus is simply not going to happen.

THE PMBR ALSO SAID that they are NOT going to do megaevolutions for Pokemon. Those suggestions are getting very old. Remember that every reply to this is going into my inbox.

 This is for all of the Yugioh players who think activating any sort of effect means that you are "chaining". I want to clarify this to hopefully end the ruthless onslaught of (necessary) comments explaining this.

How often have you seen the following (or something similar) in a post or comment?

 My opponent summoned *XXX monster*. Can I chain *XXX card* to that summon?

The answer is no. You cannot chain to that summon. Chaining to a summon simply doesn't exist in the game. And here's why.

**[Read this if you don't know what a chain is or are not aware that they resolve backwards.](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Chain)**

**Starting a Chain**

Summons don't start a chain. Special summoning as a result of an effect doesn't start a chain either. it's only the result of an effect.

After summon, two windows pass: summon negation then summon response. The first window doesn't pass if the summon was the result of an effect. The second one can if it was the last thing to resolve. Activating an effect in either window starts a chain. Adding another chain link on top of that is considered "chaining".

**What Chaining Really Is**

Chaining ONLY happens after a chain link is already started. For example, if my opponent activated a Spell/Trap or Monster Effect, I can chain to that. If my opponent summoned a monster, I cannot chain to that. But I can start a chain. After I start a chain, my opponent can chain to that. In short, chaining is "adding a chain to a chain that already exists". Responding to a summon is not chaining.

**Summons don't start a chain**

Summons don't start a chain. Effects start a chain. Even if a monster is special summoned by an effect, it doesn't start a chain. The Special Summon is only a result of that chain link resolving. It does not start a new chain or add to the current chain link.

Non-Inherent special summons are often called "summons that start a chain". This is misleading and I believe is the case for players thinking that chaining to a summon is possible. These summons don't start a chain, an effect in a chain resulted in the special summon of a monster. For these summons, there is no summon negation window, which is why *Thunder King Rai-Oh* cannot negate the effects of *Geartown* or *Blaster, Dragon Ruler of Infernos*.

**Pseudo-inherent Normal/Special Summons**

Some special summons happen from applying an effect of a continuous card. Continuous cards act like lingering effects that are applied as long as the card is face-up. Unless the effect has a **:** or **;**, the effect does not start a chain. This is true for cards like *Fire Formation - Tensu* and *Hazy Pillar*. Therefore, a player need not declare the card effect's activation and wait for a response. It is however common courtesy to say why the monster was normal or special summoned.

**So what did we learn today?/Summary for the Stupid**

* Summons do not start a chain
* Starting a chain is not the same as Chaining
* Chaining refers to adding a chain to a pre-existing chain, not starting a chain
* Summons don't start a chain, effects do.

^(Some of this may be wrong due to tricky wording in how game mechanics work for continuous effects. A more experienced judge may please correct this.)

Edit: added some examples. Thanks Ultimate_spaghetti. Also italicized card names.

Edit2: Trimmed the fat.

EDIT3: A couple important side-notes courtesy of Krylife

Cards activating and effect activating are different. There are spells/traps that have effects that activate separately from the card's activation. Best example is *Grand Spellbook Tower*.

Chaining refers to the activation of a card or effect. Resolving happens backward after the chain is built, and new chains cannot be added during resolution.

Chains don't special summon a monster. An effect that resolves can summon a monster.

**Notes:**

Please, this is a budget deck^1. It's also a fun deck. If I could easily afford and pull wolfbarks like everybody else instead of being a shit-pull magnet, I'd easily have Wolfbark in this.

I tried Hazy Flame Sphynx paired with Plaguespreader Zombie. It wasn't consistent enough to work. Pleaguespreader was too hard to have in the Grave reliably. Sphynx was often absent when the right time came around.

When Hazy Flame Hydra comes out, it will most likely wholeheartedly replace Hazy Flame Hyppogrif. I feel at 2 would be just fine since it puts the deck at 5 L6 Rekindling summonables. It's also stronger and works with Basiltrice to make a 5M Basiltrice much easier.

I had considered taking Blaster out. But, he's still very good in this deck at 1. He gives me Star Eater^1 plays about once every 10-15 duels. I won't get rid of Ptolemy^1 unless I pick up constellars again. 

Yes 2 cowboy. There have been times where I wish I had that 2nd cowboy to do a 2nd rekindling into another cowboy for that last 800 for game.

Thanks to 2 Tenki, that's right just two, I am theoretically guaranteed to open with a monster, and I have better top decks. Makes 3 Onslaughts less necessary.

I know I ask for a lot of help with this deck, but since this is the most agressive and spamfilled deck I run, I'm not experienced with building it that way. I always end up trying to make some sort of control deck to better fit my more comfortable playstyle. Once in a while I OTK, but I kinda get lucky and go for obvious ones. Rekindling's not hard to OTK with in the right decks, and it probably should go down to 1 or even 0 if the right decks takes advantage of it too much.

^(1. Star Eater and Ptolemy were both gifts from my girlfriend /u/Lily247 so giving those up simply isn't an option. Shoutout to my girl.)

EDIT: Heroes aren't the problem with stratos, and hero players whining over it need to stop complaining. It was part of an FTK that also involved divine wind. My GF told me about that so I don't have all the details. Stratos was also used in teledad as I understand and players trying to bring it back after certain cards were back up to 3 also didn't help stratos stay out of the forbidden section. 









 Well, everyone's hyped, and now there's more people than ever on this iconic day asking so many questions. (So I'll probably be adding more questions and their answers to this)

---



**Q: What time is it being released?**

*A*: Nobody knows. I'm not even sure the PMBR knows exactly when. Their site is down, and they will need time to finalize the demo, export it for all methods of loading, and fix their site. Not to mention, UPLOADING the hack.

**Q: How big is the new update? And/or Do I need a bigger SD card?**

*A*: It was said by a backroom member that it will still fit on a 512mb SD card. We would all still recommend at least 1GB so you can add as much custom goodies as you want.

**Q: Will stage x or feature y be introduced?**

*A*: If you don't know, or haven't seen it in a stream, default this answer to no.

**Q: Does anybody know what they did to character x?**

*A*: Please assume nobody knows. You'll know in less than 24 hours.

**Q: Will my custom content still work with P:M?**

*A*: If it's music or a simple texture or stage replacement, it should still work. If it's something fancy like a stage selection screen or weird code-set that adds more stages (dot dot dot), assume it won't be able to be carried over. Huge fancy mods to P:M (which is already a mod) should be reimplemented to plant bugs.

**Q: What's the first thing you're gonna do?**

*A*: Slay the magic dragon :P what do you think? My assumption is that most players will be trying either new characters, new costumes, and/or turbo mode. I will also assume that most people will be making sure their custom content works. ^(Some people may be trying 1P mode)

**Q: why do ppl even use their own custom stuff? it just adds to the loading and cause problems, nd they dont often look that good either** -SuperBARN

*A*: People like to have fun. Even the backroom members and testers had some fun with some custom costumes and music.

**Q: Question for [OP] because I feel like it. What's your favorite alt so far?** -Nyan_Ryan

*A*: It was teased in the alt costume release, so I'm hoping that Jigglypuff's crown is really back. Puff is one of my more fun mains.

**Q: Will the patch notes be released soon? :] On a side note, if they release a mega lucario alt, my hype will transcend reality** -Caketastic

*A*: The PMBR probably has a lot of patch notes compared to 2.6b. So far, what we know about the patch notes is the following: Yoshi, Kirby, Samus, Ice Climbers, Olimar, Roy, and Mewtwo added to the roster. Samus has new ice beam mode and morph ball crawl. Turbo mode added. Curry changed to Turbo item. Alternate costumes added. Stage X replaced with Peache's Castle. Wifi Waiting room now available to play on.

As far as in depth patch notes go, it could be another week and a half before they can gather up every change they have implemented.

**Q: Will all these alts come with the download or do I need to get them separately?** -Clayton_11

*A*: It's safe to assume that anything that is officially part of Project M will always come with the download. So, if the Project M BR announced that it will be a part of the next set, you will not need to download it separately.

**Q: I'm emulating P:M, how exactly do I change from 2.6 to 3.0?** -Skintay12

*A*: It should be as simple as setting up 3.0 the same way you set up 2.6. So remember to take out that virtual SD card and make a new one with 3.0 in it instead of 2.6.

**Q: Do you think they're more prepared for the amount of people wanting to grab the download this time around? Site's been down all day and it feels like there's 10x as many people that are awaiting the results.** -Rawkobo

*A*: hard to say without proper knowledge of networking or what the PMBR is doing to prepare (if anything). If they are doing anything in anticipation of huge download traffic, things should be just fine. And if not, some of us will just have to be patient.

**Q: Does anybody know how turbo mode works yet? As in, how do I cancel my attacks?** -PlaptheAwesome

*A*: I don't know the inner workings of  how Turbo mode is made possible, but it allows you to cancel any successful attack into another attack. There's no sequence or button to press to cancel an attack, just perform another.

**Q: So all we will need to do is put this on an ad card and pop it in and 3.0 will work hackless?** -Andy-J

*A*: Not quite. There are a lot of video tutorials on how to do this. Start up brawl regularly. Then insert your SD card. Wait a few seconds for it to load. Then load the stage builder. Some scary stuff will happen, but then you'll see a menu with the option "start game". From there, you start the game, and clever programming takes care of the rest.

With all the hype, I just wanted the subreddit to not get a whole bunch of threads asking the same thing. Ask away, and backroom member, feel free to correct anything or answer any questions that are found in the comments. 









 I'm here to promote my first self-published book. Am I really resorting to using reddit to shamelessly promote my story? Of course. I wouldn't blame anybody else for doing it. We all need a little help.

**Last Note**

If you do decide to read (or even just read the previews), it would be greatly appreciated that you rate my product and give an honest review. 




 Well, I recently got criticizes for taking ideas from a Gravekeeper's deck that went top 8 in a reigional. This wasn't a deck full of meta calls. The recent winning geargia deck was pretty risky and fascinating to see what he was doing. Calling that he would be seeing more Elemental Dragons than any other deck was a pretty smart call, although unfortunate that he supposedly had a rough time against Evilswarm.

But why are so many people dismissing it as luck? Or some fortunate meta-call? This was a smart move on the player's part. He wasn't some no-life who came from nowhere. He'd been part of the scene for a long time apparently and knew about what playing smart really means.

So all I'm trying to say is that when something that's not tier-1 (or meta) wins, don't rush to stupid conclusions.  In the end, mediocre decks will perform as such, even with their better hands. I know this from playing Hazy Kings in a few tournaments. Each player gets where they get for a reason, whether it be playing the top deck or playing against the top deck.

**Side 1:** It's just a lucky Metacall

**Side 2:** It's a mediocre deck that got lucky

Although Side 1 is closer, I can't stand people dismissing anything that's not a tier 1 win as pure luck. It would be a lot nicer if, when someone gets a little smart or creative, we don't start slitting eachothers' throats online because it's different. 




 **Intro**

I've been continuing to test Gravekeeper's and figure out where this deck lacks and what decks this deck doesn't stand up too well against. In my testing, my side-deck has shifted quite a bit. I'm still finding Penguin Soldiers a little more useful (and a lot cheaper) than Fossile Dyna. Didn't run into enough burn decks to justify running Des Wombat. I'd save that card for a local meta call. Even with EEV, decks heavy with back-row are a scary thing to go up against. I'm looking at you Fire Fists. So without further ado, here's my updated list.

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/pddkshD.png)

[Text List](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/65160123/trading/decklist.txt)

**FAQ**:

Q: 2 Upstart Goblin?

A: Yes. 2 Upstart Goblins. They speed up the deck considerably in game one and can always be sided out for something faster or more needed considering what you get.

Q: No Daimond Dire Wolf?

A: I've been thinking about it and considering it thanks to the reprint. There has been times where I seriously need to get rid of a problem monster.

Q: What decks are you still having trouble against?

A: I'm still tanking it again Vampires and Fire Fists. Fire Fists just keep that backrow coming and somehow have an answer to everything I do. And Vampires have their stupid-as-hell field card (which conveniently gets rid of necrovalley.

Q: Why the change to 2 MST and 2 Forbidden Dress?

A: Partly Frogs. The rest is other decks with similar back-row line-ups and even no line-ups. It's comforting knowing I can use two of my cards just just to save an important card but allow my opponent to waste their card in the process (if I do it right).

**Cost**

Main Deck: Around $120 but as low as $80 if you keep your rarities low.

Side Deck: Should be anywhere from $40 to $50 as long as you don't go bat crazy on EEV.

Extra Deck: Around $25 for the essentials. Around. $55 for the full thing.

**New Support**

Shut up about them. I'm not building this for the future. I'm building this for the current format. 














 For me, I can't help but put [Other M's version of Ridley](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fje8t9Jyy-o) on a Metroid Stage (Norfair being the fitting one). 




 http://imgur.com/a/zBoDx#0

My album of High Resolution scans which I will do my best to update every once in a while. I got a lot of requests that I simply couldn't fulfill, but I did as much as I could. My apologies if I didn't get to your request, but I either don't have the card or couldn't find a friend to let me borrow it. 














 In Project M 3.0, we're getting a full cast of characters and then some, and we're all ready and excited to try out the new characters (most of us for Roy and Mewtwo, but who really cares?).

Since all of these characters that we've missed are finally coming together for Project M 3.0, will the single player modes finally be stable to play? I've had problems in stadiums, Classic, and SSE when non-selectable characters showed up. Only non-problem was Home-run contest for obvious reasons.

Also, was wondering about stadium records for Roy and Mewtwo. Will they actually be able to store their own records for Break the Targets and Home Run Contest etc?

A simple response from a PMBR should suffice. 




 I'm looking to get rid of **[this mat](http://client-cdn.crystalcommerce.com/photo/ideal808/file/d0e62ab7c408b464c63e265ccf1c2f0e/large/ycs%20san%20diego%202013%20playmat.jpg)** that I'm seriously not going to use anymore. It's going for 40 dollars on ebay, but I'm willing to go as low as 30 dollars wish included shipping. If you're outside the US, I'll have to charge more to cover the added insane shipping costs.

I also have plenty of miscellaneous bulk from Shadow Specters. Willing to sell it for super super low. (5+shipping).

 Ask some bullshit ruling question. Make up shit. Whatever the fuck you want. Keep it random and entertaining. Keep in mind this thread isn't for actual rulings. It's for fun.

**EXAMPLE POST**

If my opponent attacks with his pancake stack and the pad of butter hits one of my cards, does the sleeve's effect protect it from being destroyed?

---

There you go! Have fun! I also forgot to mention that you are allowed to post fake rulings in response to other's entries. Go bat shit crazy y'all.

Edit: I'll send the user who posts the most entertaining post on this thread some cards from my recent pulls. 




 Keep them requests coming. Lol. Of course, I don't have an infinite amount of cards, not do I come close to having every card imaginable. But I can always try to borrow what I need. So here it is, 600dpi scan of Gagaga Cowboy. 1388x2044

**[Link to Image](http://i.imgur.com/MzhbWgc.jpg)** 









 Special thanks to Lily247 for letting me scan one of her favorite cards, and what's probably her favorite ghost rare. And, we all know this is her favorite ritual monster! IT'S A FAIRY!

Shout out to you!

**[Link to Image](http://i.imgur.com/ikR5gQ3.jpg)** 




 I had a scanner and a Royal Tribute available. Naturally, I got bored. So I decided to see if these scans I find on the internet were really as high quality as they get. Turns out, 500x500 card art at its max is pretty shit. There aren't people scanning at 600 DPI like I do. Just the art for the card came out to 1000x1000. I'm tempted to make a Royal Tribute mat out of this.

Note, the image of the quality good be better. But it's not the most high quality scanner.

**[Link to high quality image of Royal Tribute](http://i.imgur.com/fb7LOgq.jpg)** 




 I'm back with another game-ish thread. Everyone likes to be theoretical. I mean, why not? It's always fun to think about the what-ifs. Even as serious players, it's great to take a break and have a little fun with out brains.

---

So, to get us going, here's my question for today...

**What if Konami changed the rules so that any normal monster need not be tributed to be normal summoned?**

How would this effect your deck? How would this effect other decks? Would normal monsters get more support? Is there anything they would need to add to this rule to keep it balanced? Assume Gemini and similar cards do not count. The monster card must be yellow, not brown, for this rule to apply.

---

For me? I would probably run a huge beatstick deck that featured huge normal-monster beaters and skill drain. Of course, I'd probably still use Malefics in it, but it would be awesome to see what kind of cool new decks could be derived from here. Hell, I wonder if this would get any cards on the banlist. 









 I'm not going to make anybody pay. I have some free time though, and I wanted to make some playmats. But I need some ideas. So why doesn't everyone submit an idea so I can see what I can do?

 I had a gif saved on an old account I threw away. the title was something similar to

"when I'm feeling down, I always look at this gif. It never makes me feel any better."

It had a pot-selling pony holding out her hoof and the words "eat a d*ck" appearing after sparkling in the BG. I wasn't able to find it, and I'm out of search ideas.

Just asking if somepony can help me find it so I can re-save it on this user account. 









 Let's play another Yugioh Based Creativity Game!

Did you miss my first game where we made small tweaks to archetypes to make them tier 1 matierial (pun intended, hence the mispelling)? Well, fret not, I'm back with another game.

---

**Archetype Popcorn Game**

Here are the rules:

* You post ONE card in an archetype you make up.
* Let others reply to that post adding to that archetype.
* No replying to add more to your own archetype.
* Leave your archetype name in *italics* and the card name in *bold*.

That's all there is to it. But, please, don't just break the archetypes. Be respectful, not a douche.

---

I'll be leaving my submission in the comments. 




 So I have a friend who wants to build ghostricks. She went to the sneak peek and pulled quite a few. But the kicker is, she pulled a Bujin Kasauchi (i forget it's exact name). You know, the one going for 30 dollars. Of course, she could have sold it and finished her current deck.

And she knows I wanted bujins. She knows I would have just loved to have one meaningful bujin in my life.

She fucking traded it for a one dollar ghostrick lantern.

Never again will I let her go alone without telling her to check every fucking price she can. She called the excuse that she didn't know the price. She had her phone on her the whole time. She could have checked. Ebay and Yugiohprices.com are a thing.

I'm sorry, I'm just fucking pissed she had to spend 20 dollars, get a great card, and give it away like table scraps when she needed the money for her deck. 




 Day 6

I woke up with a migrane. The same migrane I've been having every day when I wake up and every night before I go to sleep. I was hungry. Of course I was. Who isn't hungry when they wake up? There was hardly anything to eat other than the cereal in the corner pantry which never seems to run out. I shouldn't even be eating this cereal because of my alergies, but it keeps my stomach full. What's a rash on my arms compared to days starvation?

I put the milk back in the mini fridge in the corner. The only other room I have access to is the restroom. It's been getting more and more empty every day. Today, after I ate my breakfast, I went to brush my teeth and noticed my toothbrush was gone. I at least used mouth wash to help my mouth feel fresh.

Then I got to doing the only thing I know that takes the migrane away. Playing games. I have at least a dozen board games to play with and even a bunch of video games from the 1990s. I had plenty to keep myself busy and entertained. What sort of game will I have to resort to when I'm done with all of these? Whoever put me here already thought of that. The games are very replayable.

So I went to a board game today. I pretend there are four other players there. I roll play them. Their names are Dan, Nathan, and Felix. They play with me. We're all psychic. Only with each other. It makes Clue no fun. I'm just waiting for that to disappear so I don't have to look at it any more.

Today I found this journal and a pensil. I think they want me to write in it, so I am. I can use it to keep notes for myself about what I've been playing them. Soon I'll hear the knocking. That's when I have to go to sleep. The knocking just keeps hapenning if I don't. I can't open the door. I'm not allowed.

---

Day 7

I woke up with a migrane. The same migrane I've been having every day when I wake up and every night before I go to sleep. I was hungry. Of course I was. It was the same thing yesterday and it's going to be the same thing today. What's a rash on my arms compared to days starvation? I keep telling myself so I can put up with the symptoms.

Today, after I ate my breakfast, I went to brush my teeth and remembered that my toothbrush had disappeared. The mouth wash was gone too, as if it had vanished. I couldn't do anything but leave my mouth rinsed with hot water. I was prepared to take a shower today, but the shower curtain disappeared as well as the showerhead.

I got back to playing games again. What sort of games will I be here to when I'm done with all of these? Whoever put me here already thought of that. The games are very replayable. I'm rewriting this to remind myself that the games are worth it. They're worth it over laying all day with a head-ache. I can't sleep as long as the light is kept on.

So I went to a board game today. I pretend there are four other players there. I roll play them. Their names are Dan, Nathan, and Felix. They play with me. We're all psychic. Only with each other. It makes Clue no fun. I'm just waiting for that to disappear so I don't have to look at it any more.

I figured out why I can't use this journal to take notes on my games. They took the pages of yesterday's journal. I'm going to test to see if they take these pages too. It's almost time for me to get to sleep. With a migrane of course.

---

Day 8

I'm still waking up with a migrane. It's still not changing. The migrane I bear while I'm not playing. I'm beginning to smell. Is this waht they want? For me not to be able to do what I want? The cereal changed, but I'm still alergic to it. The rash is still just as bad from this one as it was from the last.

I'm getting a bit sick of the board games. Some of them are missing. I won't be able to finish the game of Life I started yesterday. It was a 1 vs 1 match between Dan and me. I'm digging into the video games now. One system, one controller, one TV. All in my one little room. You know, if you don't count the restroom. i don't even count it as a room anymore. Nothing but a couples towest and toilet paper.

I kept myself entertained for the entire day. Not very hard. I got through three simple games. My head didn't feel too great while switching, but a few minutes at a time isn't nearly as bad as the hours I spend waking up and going to sleep.

My last pages were missing. I'm wondering why you're taking them. Why do you want my random thoughts? What the fuck is this going to prove? I don't even know where I am.

---

Day 9

I still don't have a goddamn clue. What the hell do you want? Stop taking my pages. I just want to be able to re-read them once. Why are you making them disappear? What else are you going to make disappear? I'm out of food. What more can you take away from me.

You can't possibly think I'd rather be hungry than have a rash. I'm getting sick from the hunger. It's almost worst than the pain in my head. Is this the kind of notes you want?

The games are still keeping me entertained. They're keeping the headache away while they can. The ones I played yesterday are gone. If I'm not allowed to play games more than once, I'll eventually be left with nothing but a headache.

---

Day 10

Bastards. The first thing to go was my bed. Then the chairs. Then the table. Eventually, everything else. What good is a game without the controller? What good is this last board game without others? Without friends? Without companionship? Worthless. This experiment is worthless. What you're doing is worthless. You're worthless.

Am I worthless? Is that it? Am I just a worthless mouse to you? I'll break through this door eventually. It has to break some time.

---

Day 11

FUCK YOU 




 **Calling all fellow Gravekeeper's players.**

So a lot of us have a great time building up a main deck but don't quite get the hang of building side-decks.

I can already hear you saying, "Every deck needs sides based on its own meta and where it's going to be used. Just adjust it to your locals. You're a faggot. Get off Reddit. Fuck you."

Of course, we all have out meta-specific and locals-specific sides. But leave that aside. What cards are you siding and why do you think they're worth siding in Gravekeeper's?

* Penguin Soldier: Flip-activated Compulsory on crack, or a Spy Bluff. If you're opponent knows GK's, they're going to destroy your facedowns, not attack them.
* Imperial Iron Wall: Works against plenty of decks, especially the big daddy of them all, Dragon Rulers.
* Dimensional ~~Prison~~ Fissure: Helps against Mermails. Gravekeeper's can fill up their grave by using Xyz based plays to avoid dead Stele.
* Thunder King Rai-Oh: Heavy Stun. Enough said.
* Maxx "C": Opponent spamming the summons? Let's fix that.
* Veiler: Because there are those problematic effects we just need to stop for one turn.
* Gozen Match: All Dark Monsters except for 1 Earth that normally never hits the field anyways. Penguin Soldier still possible to set.
* Rivalry of the Warlord: Huge ammount of Spellcasters. So why not?
* Deck Devistation Virus: Usable with Descendant or Assailant while Necrovalley is on the field.
* Eradicator Epidemic Virus: Usable with Malefic Stardust Dragon, Malefic Cyber End Dragon, and Master Key Beetle.

What sides did I miss? What reasons do you run your specific sides?

Edit: fixed mistake found by DiskJockey13 




 Okay everybody, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to help us get a little creative about what we think of our favorite archetypes and what we really want from them. If this gets some good reaction and discussion going, I'll be happy to continue to post these kinds of games on here.

---

**Ground Rules**

* *DON'T MOD THE BAN LIST. This is a game for creativity, not posting your ban-list wish list.*
* Don't create new cards for the main deck. Limit extra deck cards to 1 if you can.
* Don't completely change their design. Just tweak it to make it more competitive.
* Don't aim to break your archetype. That's boring. We just want to compete.
* Do have some fun. It's a game.
* Do discuss other's changes and respond to others changing yours.

---

**My Submission**: Gravekeeper's

I love Gravekeeper's. They're slow. They're controlling. But, terribly inconsistent for most people. They're big disadvantage is not being able to recycle Necrovalley, being relatively weak without it, and resorting to Malefics to handle big beaters. Regardless, since Royal Tribute is so busted, they don't need many cards to be reworked. So here's my tweaks.

* Gravekeeper's Guard: Flip; Return 1 monster on the field to the controller's hand, and if you do, you can special summon 1 level 4 or lower Gravekeeper's monster from your graveyard. This effect cannot be negated by "Necrovalley".
* Gravekeeper's Commandant: You can discard this card to the Graveyard; add 1 "Necrovalley" from your Deck or Graveyard to your hand.
* Gravekeeper's Stele: Target 2 "Gravekeeper's" monsters in your graveyard and/or Banished; add those targets to your hand.
* You can Tribute 1 other face-up "Gravekeeper's" monster to target 1 card your opponent controls; destroy that target. If a card effect activates that would negate this monster's effect: you can normal summon 1 Level 4 "Gravekeeper's" monster from your hand in addition to your normal summon or set.

What these tweaks take care of:

* Gravekeeper's now have a way to SS from the grave without it being a +0/-0 trap.
* Gravekeeper's can now Recycle Necrovalley if need be.
* Gravekeeper's no longer tremble at bottomless trap hole.
* Gravekeeper's can set up an Xyz play in case their main play doesn't work out. Makes Key beetle more consistent. 




 We're looking for ideas for bots that could help spruce up /r/YGOSales and make it more interesting. The same goes for anything else. If you have an idea to make /r/YGOSales a better place, don't hesitate to leave a comment here or message the moderators.

I am welcoming feedback. If you think you have an idea to make this deck more consistent or faster than it already is, please let me know. Do you think I should be running some weird unknown tech? Just let me know. 









 I made a new account since my Rifall nickname is wearing off. My friends call me reiden, and Rifall is getting hard to remember, and it's no fun to keep correcting people on the pronounciation. I even have friends who call me refill.

I'll still be here moderating. Just with a new name.
