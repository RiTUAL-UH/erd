 While the formatting on most of those is garbage it might be easier than this big txt file, I'll play with it thanks for the link. 




 I had thought maybe I would use admob for mobile ads but goddamnit I hate ads. So for now I don't want any money. If for whatever crazy reason hosting gets expensive I'll worry about that then.

 You bastard. 




 That would be pretty awesome. I'll look into it as soon as I've made my way through the MASSIVE amount of books still left to add.

Also if anyone knows how to quickly do it chime in as I'm sure it will be a while before I get to it, though I do want to get to it.
