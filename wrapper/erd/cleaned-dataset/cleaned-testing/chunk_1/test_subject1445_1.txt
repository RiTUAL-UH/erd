 I've been on the medication about a month.  I mean, I wasn't expecting happy daisies and roses and unicorns out my butt soon after taking it, but I can't tell if the way I feel is because the medicine isn't the right medicine, or if it really is everything else. :/  Definitely a really awkward place to be.  Especially because if I break up with my boyfriend, he'd have to move back in with his parents across the country (U.S.) and that would be it for us.  No real chance of reconciliation.  




 Hi everybody.  I've been a lurker on reddit for a little while, but I need somebody, anybody to talk to.  
I was diagnosed with depression about a month ago, and was put on Wellbutrin.  That's all fine, but I feel like nothing will change unless I change what is going on in my life, but I feel like I can't.
I'm currently in my 2nd year of a 2 year Master's program, and honestly?  I don't want the degree. I have realized that science research is not my thing, at all.  I don't even slightly enjoy it.  The only thing I enjoy about it is that i can be a TA. However, I am in debt a little bit from it.  Everyone tells me "the hard part is over!  You only have a few more months!"  but those months include smashing out a long thesis over a subject I absolutely do not enjoy.  I don't enjoy any of the program at all.  It is not what I want to do.  I'm not sure what career path is for me, but this is not it. 
Also, I live with my boyfriend of 2.5 years.  And... I've been considering breaking up with him.  A lot.  I just don't feel the same way about him, plus I don't want to be tied down to the same person since I was 21 (I'm 24).  It's hard to describe, but it hurts.  I've voiced it to him, but we live 3000 miles from any family, so we're stuck in this position. 
So, I'm not sure what to do.  Or if anybody has ever had anything like this feeling before.  That you are stuck in the life you are in, and there's nothing you can do to change it.  To top it off, I'm not sure if the depression is causing all these feelings about school/boyfriend, or if the school/boyfriend is causing the depression.  I just don't know. 
If anybody has any advice, I would really appreciate it.  I am new to depression, and very scared. 

TL;DR--have depression, hate current life and feel stuck, I feel like I can't escape without causing big problems.
