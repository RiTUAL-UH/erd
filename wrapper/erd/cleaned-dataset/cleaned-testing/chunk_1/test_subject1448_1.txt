 HUEHEUHEUHEH 









 Same thing here. It used to happen with me last year, i had 2~3 ''visions'' per day, and I got used to it just like you. My ''visions'' were from minor events of the day, not only when someone was about to call me. Nowadays, i think i have 1 ''vision'' per week, don't know why this happened =/ 




 Edited, lol 




 I'll soon turn 18, and i play poker since i was 15. I really want to invest in my poker career, but i don't know where to start.

EDIT: I played in pokerstars since i was 15.

EDIT2: Thanks for all the answers, means a lot to me! 




 Wow!! That's an amazing experience/writing. In my country, the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms is a very discussed (and studied) thing: the presence of trusted people alongside you, during the trip, is very important indeed to the trip travel safer roads.

One question: do you remember the species (and the dosage that you guys used that night) of those shrooms? It is a valuable information, cause the totality of the trip fully depends of those partcular factors.

Again, nice experience, bro. Would have gilded if i had gold jajajajaja. 




 And you've been high for how long in this particular trip? 




 And you did not feel like trying crack again? 




 Wow, and with such an unusual metting, are you guys still together? 




 All types of drugs are accepted.
