 Clearly they don't. 




 I'm surprised my gf doesn't do that, honestly. 




 Same kind of thing on Jenova. Bots are kinda creepy, IMO. 




 I played a few months before my SO, and she just got into the game about a month or so ago. She enjoys playing it, which surprised me. Since we are just getting into a long-distance relationship since she moved for University, she decided to play it so that we have something to do together; and now she's obsessed with Moogles. Go figure.

I think that if you can, you should tell her to at least try it. I agree with some of the things that people said in here, at least in terms of trying it. As the saying goes, "don't knock it 'til you try it." 




 Forever haunting your dreams... 




 What's up, BTBAM! Been listening to you guys for the last couple years or so when a friend of mine introduced me to Colors! I was amazed that I hadn't listened to you guys beforehand, and now I'm a huge fan! 

When you guys write, do you write everything out in a music notation program? And if you do, how much of it is already completed by the time you start writing all of it out?  




 Waiting on my blu-ray! This sounds so good! 




 Boss as fuck.
