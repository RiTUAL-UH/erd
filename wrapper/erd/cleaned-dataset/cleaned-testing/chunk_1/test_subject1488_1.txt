 Watched a doc of a family using a pot with an iron upside down, with a pot of water on top of the iron to heat bath water (along with 2 coffee pots and misc other things).
 




 Gel medium? I thought they used mod podge for this, can I use hair gel? 




 If it means a lot to you - adtr
Stay out - hit the lights
Siren - the dangerous summer
Just stay - strange bacation
The space between, and probably a lot of other songs by Valencia
A lot of Brighten songs
Thing left to lose - transit 




 Hell yeah. Used to love this band but forgot about them. 




 Not my type but you'll do fine on a dating site. Pictures are fine. GO FOR IT 




 Yes! Saving this post. I know they'll say omega 3 and vitamin b rich food but curious for further input.

Side note: gluten makes me very depressed. 




 This is so intriguing and scary. Does he sound smart or like he knows algorithms? Heard he had an IQ of 110. Handwritting? 




 seriously, is it really that hard to just fuck Amanda ahhaha 




 Gonna start using this instead of Go Fuck Yourself. 




 I didn't pick up on her intentionally wanting a baby. The scene with Derek's sister is made me think she wanted to leave her family and move in with another family, like Derek's or something. But the theory here makes more sense for the show. Fuck, I hope not though. 




 So much always happens in an episode, I feel I have to comment while watching the episode to actually convey everything I want to say... But that's not going to happen.

Love Lip's stuff still, I really don't think they're going to get him caught in some way like the others... Unless this is the last season - interesting way to end the show for good is if they put everyone in jail or suicide. I think it's becoming more clear that his storyline will be to enter the professional world and succeed, even if his luck pisses viewers off

Definitely want to kill Sammi. At the same time, I thought she was going to kill herself after she told Ian he was great and going to be okay. Her, Ian, and Charlie could all be in the running for a suicide ending, hopefully not. I think there's going to be a crazy season finale of a very smart death brought upon by Mickey and Fiona, maybe the rest of the Gallagher squad as well.... BUT at the same time, like Lip said last episode, Carl going to jail was inevitable at some point, and Ian getting caught is as well. It was something they were responsible for, Sammi just bridged the gaps I guess.

Don't get Debbie pregnant. Don't. Urghh. Still, I do like the relationship and don't think having sex was wrong for her. Yes, she'd still young, but at least it's in a caring, healthy relationship, plus they seem to be best friends which is most important (i think) during teen sex.

Fucking Fiona, okay, the kiss was in a specific context but just... be a prude for an episode or something.

Hate commenting on Frank but he's so in love, even if it's a friend kinda love. This makes me upset, but happy at the same time. I think the doctor dies at the end of the season, showing that Frank can experience heartbreak and sadness -- I don't think she'll be cured or they'll call her with a fake positive or anything like that. 




 No question she's going to die. I bet it'll be in the finale, a long, smart plan by Mickey, Fiona, maybe even Frank and Lip. It's gonna be good. 




 a guy putting his dick in your vagina and thrusting, then cumming. then you both leave. 




 still have it?  




 aside from pills, eating right, exercise, melatonin, not laying around in bed or the room where you sleep, keeping TV and the phone away for a couple hours before bed, and try youtube meditation or night time sleep videos with soothing sounds.

This is easier said than done, I tend to just take various pills (ambien, a benzo, otc sleep aids, melatonin, and tylonel pm/nyquil). 




 Lol really cheap. Like $0.25/milligram. 




 Broke and friendless. 




 Don't really have a favorite band anymore. I mean, there are a few bands I like but I know they're nothing groundbreaking and their music isn't anything to move mountains. Haven't been to a show in forever either.... 




 Walls. So they could talk and move and kill people. 




 and assembly line. 




 and cotton gin. 




 Yes. The light bulb. 




 Well that's no good. 




 Why! I feel that'd be perfect 




 Okay I'll probably take the adderal tomorrow and hit the gym then write my paper ;) 




 What is your normal day like? How do you handle weather and physical strain/lethargy? 




 Really interesting thread, the comments completely show the opinions of the males and the feelings of the females. Emotionally, as a girl that's been through this, i would be upset too because I tend to have the "I need it all" mentality with guys and friends, and I can't always get over a hook up if it's not someone I met that night, and have to face as a friend/acquaintance. I know it's bad and not right to do it to him, but it's just my emotions.  Now on the practical side, I would love to say I can move forward and he should not feel bad about my interpretation and doesn't need to apologize. 

I think it's best to both remain practical and show hints of remorse for not being on the same page, as well as learning that girls are weird and emotional. 




 My goal is half bakery half community room--music, art classes, craft shows, etc. Midwest is a little far though 




 amen 




 Well, I don't know really. I think that's you're part, you have to get creative. Services don't really require much capital versus producing goods. Haven't you ever heard of the red paperclip trade? Maybe get certified in a trade, like software, design, etc and begin in that way. Good luck. I really say this because I fee the same way and really don't think working for someone is right for me and can't seem to find a company and position that I will work well with. I want to live my life combining all the things I love and be my own leader, I don't know how far working for a company will take me as far as natural fulfillment. I plan on (hopefully) opening my own food business, then expanding to greater things.

Where do you live? I could use a partner... 




 Be your own boss. Create a business, create things, help create. Travel. 




 It depends. Sometimes I'm in the room I grew up in for 15ish years or in a wide open area like a barn without any furniture. I never seem to be in multiple locations in the dream though, it doesn't change settings. Usually I'm alone or with one other person, although I have had a couple where I was with strangers.. When I say strangers I literally mean people I cannot recognize, have no idea what there name is and feel like I have never even met them in passing in my life. 

No. They feel like they last FOREVER which is terrible because most of them really scare me and I feel I'm trapped. ill fall asleep and then wake up after and see my clock only said 1/2 hour has passed. Feels more like 12 hours in the dream. 




 do you have any ties to St. Pete, Florida?  




 So do you like... Wanna be friends.. Or... Uh..
 




 Both sound right up my alley. Much appreciated. 




 I think i read this but will try again, thank your 




 Thank you. A lot of titles listed are books I've heard but never seemed to get around to. 




 Really? I've heard of it but figured it's script only. I'll search it.

You use it? 




 I just don't understand or believe in meditation. Isn't meditation just relaxing and trying to clear the mind for a while. I've tried that, I've done some YouTube videos, just doesn't seem like something that could change my life for more than half an hour. I don't know. 




 Yes! Just reserved both. Should be good. 




 If you're not covered in flour, you're not a real chef.

Or may it's the opposite. 




 Well well well, this is a great question and discussion. I have my popcorn ready. 




 Judging an animal competition for Legos. 




 See you there 




 You can't take out a loan? What about shadowing someone?

Seems like you're doing well and happy (to an extent). Good for you. Waiting wouldn't be terrible... 




 Yeah I love that little area in Snyder 




 I'd talk with them and learn if they have the same mannerisms and emotions as we do. 




 A weird feeling when you have what you think is a great idea and there are already a few similarities within the area. It's like discovering America only to find it was already discovered. 




 a tomato because i'm controversial and kinda sweet. 




 Just create a station on Spotify and you'll get all the related bands that are popular in the genre right now. I also really like Major League. 




 Probably french fries with mayo and ketchup. I could eat them for every meal, every day. Plus, there are so many different varieties and cuts of potato! 




 I love fiber one cereal so I understand what you're talking about. I think bars or those cookies would be the death of me so I don't eat them. I'd keep them out of your cupboard because they might end up harming you. Drink a lot of water though. I also know that if you always eat a lot of fiber, your body gets used to it and you stop shitting so much.

are you eating less and feel more full in general? if so, it's probably good that you're getting extra fiber. just cut back a little bit.

I love chips like corn chips or tortilla chips with salsa. I also have a very unhealthy obsession with bagels and french fries! Gotta cut those out completely. 




 Grab generic food from aldis or save a lot of something like that. Maybe a bag of chips for every 2 people. Cook something, like a homemade dip or brownies. Invite people to bring something if they'd like or plan on making smores in the microwave or something silly... like a taco party, or a nacho party.

games like cards against humanity, charades, apples to apples are cool. and of course drinking games like have you ever, truth or dare, etc. are fun (even if you're not drinking). 




 if you like pop punk:
transit, the story so far, state champs 




 I don't mean to be offensive or anything when I say this, but it feels like you're mentally retarded. At the same time, it makes me feel like I'm the world's biggest philosopher. You have short trains of thought. You will go through a phase of intense laughter and feel your eyes squish together.

Then I usually nap. 




 I'venever heard of that in my life.

I make amazing stromboli though. 




 Intriguing! Can you do a quick run down of what Ayahuasca is and what it's able to do? I feel I read about this once and someone posted it was the worst thing they're ever done but holds great power. 




 Stop trying to force something that isn't there. He's not the one, but a significant person in your life you should keep around. 




 Okay, I get what youre saying. I wouldn't market it as "art therapy" and i doubt we would get to the point with real therapists and correct procedure, etc. Art classes, yes, that is more correct. 




 I feel a lot of people have mixed feelings on indian dishes, which tend to be mostly vegetarian. Not sure about that. I want to stay away from pasta because I feel it's so hard to get right. The sauces are something I take very seriously as an Italian-American. 




 Yes and no. Maybe I should say Art AS therapy in this case. I was thinking more out loud and probably should have tweeked my wording before posting. My idea is simply to make art, do artistic things, get people engaged, give them something to do, maybe learn a new skill. I'm an art therapy minor and have friends within the program that teach classes that do not call it art therapy but hold the general idea over the classes they offer -- like shrines, mandala work, etc.

Writing this quickly on almost a dead battery so apologies for grammar and what not! 




 I haven't had this account for 2 months, yet I've gotten 2 months of Reddit Gold so far. I see no perks about it. If there was a better tradeoff, I probably would do it. It'd just me a symbol for our connection, this time and place, who I am and who you are. 




 whoa, that one is firey! Thanks for the knowledge! 




 Checked briefly his history and did a search that didn't show up with anything. Wasn't until now that I checked the universal block page and even though i scrolled down alphabetically, I did not scroll down ALL the way and see his name. Also now found more dirt on him. Filed a claim with Paypal and hope to get my money back. 




 Sports hold more meaning than... I don't even have an example what girls talk about because all I hear is blah blah blah. 

I'm a female btw.
