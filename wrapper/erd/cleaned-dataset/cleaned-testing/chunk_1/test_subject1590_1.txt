 I found lots of startup-related services being offered on Fiverr. Those look entire untrustworthy to me (in fact, everything offered on the site looks quite untrustworthy). But since Fiverr has such high traffics, they must be good for something I guess. Anyone (especially startup founders) has experience working people there? 




 No, I am not the author, but you can contact him here http://toddwschneider.com/about/ 









 I didn't create this, saw the image somewhere else and decided to post it here. But you are right, this is misleading sometimes. 









 At the moment yeah, open open to two countries because opening up to more countries requires some additional development work (e.g. converting exchange rates and so on). There is one way to work around it though, sign up as US or Canada, and then go to your profile page and make the change. Sorry for the inconvenience. 




 No problem! Thanks for suggesting the question too! 




 If you go to the Entertainment section, you will see your question (which currently has 1 response). You will have to wait for a while before you can see results (because others have to complete it first). 




 Sorry about this! What is the question you asked? 









 Thanks for the feedback! 




 Thanks for the links! 




 Thanks for the feedback! 




 Tried, but never got them to feature us, they simply receive tooooo many submissions everyday. 




 Thank you! Very help indeed. 




 Thanks! Any idea where you may find these people and what do offer them usually? 




 If you browse as a guest, your default location is Canada (because we don't know where you are and also don't want to save your IP and figure out your location that way). We have to pick a location for you so yeah, we picked where we are. 




 I've been working on a site called Arima (http://arima.io) with a team for a few months now. We have built a pretty decent product (I think) and we are just in the initial stage of gaining traction (public released in 10 days ago). We get about 30 or so users a day.

Let me begin by describing what our startup does. We are a Q A site for mass opinion. Basically, unlike most Q A sites, where responders can freely enter text (which becomes difficult to browse once you get a lot of answers), we focus on multiple choice and numerical responses, and help you tally up answers so that it is easy to see what the mass think. We also try to get you some in-depth analysis of data, such as what people from you country/city selected or answered, their demographics information and so on. In short, think of us as Quora for Mass Opinion.

Like every consumer internet startup, we are a site requires a lot of visitors and a lot of content. For the moment, I don't know what is a good way to get initial traction. Here are some thoughts:

1) paid advertising (most obvious) - tried reddit, facebook and stumbleupon. Nothing too great at the moment.
2) Reddit - reddit has a huge userbase with a lot of users interested in this kind of stuff. I tried posting in /r/internetisbeautiful, for example, and got some traction from there. But once your post drop down to the second page you lose attention, and I am not sure how else I can utilize reddit.
3) I have a blog http://insights.arima.io where I write some articles, but again, haven't found a good way to push this out.

Please let me know what you think, and if you know any good ways to get traction, please let me know! Thanks! 









 thanks! map is on our backlog. 




 Thanks:), yeah we will try to open up to everyone as soon as we can. 




 Thanks for the tips!

We've recently added a guest login feature, now you can go in and start seeing content without actually having to register. 









 All the ads are charged in US dollars right? So if I am from Canada, and want to advertise on this platform, is credit card the only way to pay (in which case the bank would charge me an additional fee for process US payments). Are there any other ways to pay for ads (e.g. paypal)? Thanks.

 I think a 3 people team is totally fine (if you   this Google guy are the only people on board now). 




 Is he the technical person or the business person on your team?

I suggest that you should consider some alternatives. Your partner will likely spend a lot of his time with his new internship (at least for the first few month), which means that he will have less time to focus on your project. While it is true that an internship at Google makes you look good on paper, this does not solve your current problems (i.e. build a product). His experience at Google will help you in the long run, but this does not mean anything right now. I suggest that you should consider finding another partner (perhaps keep this guy as well, but on a part time basis with less equity). 




 Which city are you from may I know?

I suggestion is to find a technical co-founder. You can find this person thru 1) your college/university, 2) local meetup groups, 3) angelist or 4) linkedin. Find people who like to work for startups (even on a part time basis) and start from here. 




 If people want recipes, why not just google and find some online? 




 The home page took a really long time to load, is that just me? 




 Can you do some consulting work in the meantime? 
http://paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html read the section on consulting. 




 Honestly, I did not find the video. I knew you said there is a video, but I did not find it until the second time visiting. I was expecting more like a youtube/vimeo type video.

Still, I think having pictures is a good thing. Few people would actually watch the video because it take a long time to do so.  




 I suggest that you put fewer words on the homepage and more visuals. I don't think I would bother reading all of the texts. 




 I know engine oil changes are generally every 3-5 months or 3,000-5,000 miles, but how do you know I have driven 3k-5k miles? Do I self report that?

I think this is an interesting business idea. Personally I would not use it because I don't have access to a car now, but I think some will find it helpful. I am pretty sure that there are similar services (especially apps) out there about it, have you researched? 




 A few things

- I think you should purchase your own domain, and get a serious hosting service (not one that puts ads on your site). These things are cheap nowadays and they really make your site professional.

- I don't like sites with black background, this could be a personal thing.

- I think you should have somethings that explain what you do (other than saying you track maintenance), e.g. a video or a faq page or some visuals. It is hard to get people to sign up for something without know what it is. For example, I'd like to know (before I sign up) how you track my much I drive and when my next maintenance date is (I think that depends on time as well as how far you drove right?). Do I submit my mileage, do you estimate it based on my driving habits, or do you track with an app? 




 You should post it here if you don't mind giving it away. 




 you can try some ads via Facebook or Google targeting those interested in affiliate marketing. Or try to talk to some other sites (hopefully in the same area) and see if you guys can exchange links. 




 Here are my suggestions,

1) Do NOT start with writing a business plan (especially if your idea is around the internet). Not saying that they are useless (which I believe so), but your time could be used elsewhere.

2) If you have little cash, you better have someone who can code. This can be either through finding a CTO (your classmates, friends, people you find on LinkedIn, Angelist etc), or learn to code yourself (e.g. Codecademy). In these days, it's very hard to raise money from investors with just ideas. 

3) Start with building an MVP. Find a decent designer (this you will have to pay for, because you can learn coding but design you cannot learn quickly) and make your site look pretty, visual is important.

3) Go and talk to people with your MVP (once you have it done) and see what they say. Have them sign up for a beta or collect user interest. You may be able to get some investment with an MVP, and then that's when you can start hiring developers. 




 maybe add a new feature called browse as a guest. Users can see limited things (e.g. the first 50 events only, or can see events but not the details). That way those 17% will be able to learn about the app before giving away their info. 




 I think that you should begin with testing your product among your friends and family first. Ask them if they would pay for your product or no, and if not why not. Sometimes people don't use your product because it is bad (in which case you know you need to go to work again); sometimes they don't use it because there are similar services out there which are free (in which case you can think about a free version, and then later add more features and make it premium account, like LinkedIn); and sometimes they don't use it because they don't realize its value (e.g. if you are a new product that does not exist), in this case you can consider giving a 14 days or 30 days trial. But in all cases, you should keep in mind that if you plan to charge money, don't offer it complete for free now because most people will not pay for something that was free. 




 Very helpful articles. Thanks! 




 I think you should capitalize the "i"'s . This makes yourself a much more professional person and encourages others to go on and read your blog.... 




 Putting a video on your site (say you working in your studio/office) would be nice I think. Hearing and seeing someone talking videos make them more trustworthy. 




 I have some functions of x, in the form of d* sqrt(x) or d* log(x) where d is known. I would like to rewrite (approximate is fine) them in the form a/(1 + bx^c ), where a b and c are arbitrary.

I think one way to do this is to write out the Taylor series expansion on both sides, and then try to match coefficients. Are there better ways to approach this problem? Thanks! 




 Just my suggestion here:

Math/Probability foundations:
-Real Mathematical Analysis by Charles Pugh
-Probability: Theory and Examples by Rich Durrett
-Something on Stochastic processes would be helpful, e.g. Probability and Random Processes by Geoffrey R. Grimmett and David R. Stirzaker
-If you want to do cryptography, something in abstract algebra would be helpful, consider Algebra by Serge Lang.

For Statistics, 
You could try Theory of Statistics by Mark Schervish (a good grad book for Bayesian analysis), alternatively, you can try the classic book Theory of Point Estimation and Testing Statistical Hypotheses by Erich Lehmann.

If you're interested in machine learning, read Chris Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning or Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin Murphy.

I am not familiar with other parts of CS other than machine learning so that's my suggestion. 




 Including both job title and age should be okay, buy you need to make sure that the two aren't highly correlated (usually the older you are, the higher job title you have, and this is more common in some industries than others). Could try using levels 1-5, say, to code jobs, where 1 is no experience required, 2 is 1-5 yrs of exp, 3 is 5-10, 4 is 10-20 and 5 is 20+. Or can also try 1 = ordinary titles (like analysts, coordinators, etc). 2 = senior (e.g. senior analysts), 3 = manager, 4 = director and 5 = VP level or higher. This more or less corresponds to the yrs of exp. 




 I think you should first start by quantifying job titles. There are many job titles out there (which will be hard for you to fit in a model), and even the same job title can have very different salaries (e.g. a manager at a small company vs. a manager at Goldman Sachs). Perhaps years of experience is a better measure? 




 recall that (x-y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2, use this to find x and y. 




 Machine learning is something you should definitely learn, regardless of which branch of stats you do. I suggest try to take on a few consulting projects while you are in school (even for free) and start building a profile (much like a programmer or a designer). You can try to find projects through your university - most university offer consulting services - or professors, who typically have industry connections. Another thing you can try is through LinkedIn or through Meetup. Once you get to work on a few real projects, you will be able to learn how to communicate with non-stats/business people and really understand what the industry is doing. Then ask them for references and slowly move yourself to the fields you are interested in by taking projects from those areas. 




 graduate stats major is pretty promising these days, you can do business analytics, biostats, go work for a bank or even startups. My advice is try to take some (in fact many would be even better) computer courses while in university and learn coding before you go find a job. 




 amazing goal
