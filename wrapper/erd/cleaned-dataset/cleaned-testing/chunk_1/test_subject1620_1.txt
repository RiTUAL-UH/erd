 Of course, exercise without proper hydration, diet, and rest can definitely exacerbate a migraine 




 Hey everyone,

I've never visited this subreddit before but my family actually suggested I post something online about how I was able to overcome my migraines of 10+ years. I'm not a great writer so bear with me.

A little information about me, I am a 22 y.o male and recent college graduate. I've been suffering with migraines since the 4th grade, and while I was in High School was diagnosed with "chronic, severe migraines" by a neurologist. I have seen a few different neurologists and between ages 17-21 was prescribed between 50-200mg of Topamax daily for prevention, and various triptans (both oral and injected) for treatment of pain. The past 1.5 years I have not taken any form of migraine medication, preventative or pain relieving.

After 10+ years of migraines I have largely been able to figure out my triggers:

1. Dehydration has always been the biggest one, and also easy to figure out since I played a lot of sports in school i.e. I didn't drink enough water at soccer practice I was puking and thumping myself over the head with a soccer ball to try to get the pain to stop.
2. Changes in the weather, mainly when it gets cold. If I spend too long outside in the cold without covering my head with a warm hat I will surely get a migraine.
3. Food and blood sugar. Not in the sense that I have dietary triggers but if I go to long without eating I can get a migraine.
4. The most PAINFUL trigger for me though has always been alcohol, and as an American college student and a member of Greek-life not being able to drink can put a huge hamper on your social life. Alcohol-induced migraines gave me an entirely different breed of migraine, completely untreatable except by emptying the entire contents of my stomach multiple times over and passing out for 10-12 hours.

Here is how I've been able to remove the prescribed medications from my life and live a fun and generally unrestricted lifestyle (including alcohol use) even though migraines are always something I worry about in the back of my mind:

1. Proper exercise: I lift weights 3x a week and run between 3-5 miles 3x a week. I cannot overstate the importance of a constant regimen of exercise. Both as a preventative and spot-treatment. If I am suffering from a non-alcohol related migraine, a quick run or gym session is sure to take the pain away.
2. Hydration: I drink at least 70-80 oz of water per day, and much more if I know I'm going to be consuming alcohol.
3. Food: 3 square meals per day, and a meal or large snack before consuming alcohol is crucial.

I know what I've said might seem like very typical advice, but when I adhered to it, it totally changed my life. I went from the constant looming fear of that unfathomable, nail-through-the-head pain, to confident and generally care-free. Of course it's hard to get migraines out of your life 100% of the time, shit happens as they say, but my life has transformed for the best.

Hope this helps at least one other person the way it has helped me.
