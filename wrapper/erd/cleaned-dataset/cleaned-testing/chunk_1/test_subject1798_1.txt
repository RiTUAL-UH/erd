 Forget the ads unless you want to compete against a hundred other applicants. No matter how good you are, if you're coming off the street you're going to get lost in the pile.

Instead, identify 5 companies you want to work for. Think about what you are actually **qualified** to do, even if the only thing may be to push a broom and scrub a toilet. Try to find out an important person in that department and arrange a 15 minute meeting with them. Almost everyone will give 15 minutes to somebody who shows initiative.

Now, you have to know what they're looking for, and know something about the culture of the company. Do your research. Explain to them why their company is a fit for you and vice versa. 

If you get the job, remember 3 things:

1. Show up 5 minutes early.
2. Do something every day that isn't asked of you.
3. Stay 5 minutes late. 




 You girls want to think that about yourselves, that abs don't mean anything and you like nice boys. You are just lying to yourself. You're not fucking any boys in your friend zone. 




 Haha, they stole a pen and it ruined their wallet? 




 Dad: Men don't cook.

Me: Most chefs are men.

Dad: That's because only men can lift heavy pots in restaurants. At home, men don't cook. 




 Blow it all on 2x Kosta Browne Pinot Noir and dinner. :-P

Edit:  Never mind, they don't have it. :( 




 I would. You'll have plenty of chances to drink KJ at parties and weddings. When you are searching for yourself, try something different. Those vineyards are trying to make a name for themselves so you might discover a real gem. I have a friend who is an excellent sommelier. He started a winemaking operation a few years ago and just released his second vintage, a 2013 sauvignon blanc, for $16.99. He put a TON of time into getting it just right for him. 




 It's always a gamble, whether at $15 or at $100. I think what you enjoy is very personal. My wife and I have very different tastes but neither is "wrong." What I like about $15 is that I'm not out a whole bunch if the wine makes me say "meh." 




 It depends on the vintner. Some $20 bottles might as well be $8. But for more reputable small-batch vintners, a $20 wine probably has a little higher quality of production. The sugars are monitored more closely to determine harvest, the destemming is more thorough, the blending is a little more deliberate to create more complexity and balance that the winemaker is seeking, and it's probably aged a little more and perhaps finish-fermented in oak or cement. 









 Thank you, Ohio State, for showing why we needed a playoff. 




 Urban Meyer has always been a gambler. We'll see if it bites him in the butt this time. 




 Where. The. Hell. Was. The. Safety???? 




 displaced??? WTF??? That was inches from a torn ACL. 




 At the end of the day, it's still about viewership for ESPN and the SEC can deliver that better than any other conference. 




 **This** is why we've needed a CFB playoff. Because OSU obviously deserves a chance to make it to the championship game. 




 Damn, Alabama is the best tackling team I've ever seen in CFB. 




 start delayed to 9 pm EST. 




 Ohio State is the only team that will give Oregon a game. Alabama would get steamrolled. 




 You will get your wish. And you will regret it. There is no school in the SEC that is prepared for the Oregon offense. It's one thing to watch film and come up with a game plan. It's a completely different thing to be on the field. 




 FSU defenders not used to defending an option. You gotta make a decision. You can't be undecided. 




 Now let's just hope for no injuries. Ducks deserve to play the championship game at full strength. Well played, Oregon. 




 Exactly. Keep your team in the game mentally. If you don't convert a 4th down, the game is over. That was not the time to make that decision. That's a last-5 minute kind of decision. 




 I can not believe the coach was willing to put the entire game on the line in the 3rd quarter. How much is FSU paying him?? 




 When a coach makes a call like that, they're telling their team that they are panicking. Dumb decision. 




 FSU deserved to lose after that stupidest decision of the entire year of any coach. 




 No way. They are risking the entire game in the 3rd quarter? Dumb decision. Bad decision. Take 3. 




 That was seriously an awesome play. FSU defense has never seen an offense like this. Class is in session for FSU. 




 Oh boy, now the ball goes back to Oregon with time left for them to score. 




 FSU can definitely move the ball on Oregon. They're just not sharp inside the 20. 




 Cry me a river. Fucking white people.  









 All it means is that Americans are unimaginative idiots.  




 I bet her mother was the same way.  




 Overreaching Legislators create sentencing guidelines (20 years for this, 10 years for that, etc.). Overreaching Prosecutors use these to threaten and bully the accused into taking a plea bargain. Often the weaker the case the more threatening the prosecutors become.  




 All empires follow the trajectory of an arc. Why would you think America could/would be any different? You can't change it because of the fundamental flaws in the structure of a winner takes all, non-proportional republican system.  




 They are trying to satisfy their emotional needs by using and abusing you, including a need to feel power and superiority. Take care of yourself and try to let go of the guilt. It's ok to attend to your own needs.  They'll be ok without you being a punching bag.  




 You must be amazed by your partner's thoughts/deeds/abilities. If you don't find him/her amazing, keep looking.

 Correct rule, wrong interpretation. You should round down to 20.  




 The rule is half plus seven.  




 A progressive tax does not necessarily eliminate the incentive to having higher income unless it's up near 100%. There is, of course, a curve--The Laffer Curve. All economic models show that a progressive tax will produce the most tax revenue while still enjoying economic productivity.

In the 50s and 60s, the United States enjoyed a tremendous boost in productivity and wealth yet the top tax rates (for the top 0.1%) are almost double what they are today. 




 No tax targets only the area in which a corporation or individual is based. It all goes into a pile and is apportioned. To look at taxes as being earmarked would lead to a gross misunderstanding of the federal revenue and apportionment system of the United States.

Second, corporations do not benefit themselves. They are set up to benefit individuals, from wage earners to shareholders. By shifting the corporate tax burden to individuals, you can more accurately tax the benefit that the individual receives.

Third, eliminating the corporate tax also eliminates the incentive for keeping profits overseas and brings more money back into the U.S. where it helps Americans, rather than helping foreign economies. 




 If you ask economists, some of the proposals that almost all of them agree on would include:

* Eliminate corporate taxes - companies can reinvest more money into their businesses and create more jobs.
* Eliminate mortgage interest deduction - this deduction distorts the housing market and tends to give more benefit to wealthier people.

There are others but these are the two biggest ones off the top of my head. 




 As others have already stated, Duverger's Law is at work here. The "winner takes all" system practically guarantees that up to half of a district's citizens will be disenfranchised. I see it as a major reason for today's voter apathy.

 Glucose is a monosaccharide, meaning that its a single sugar molecule. It's pretty much the only thing cells burn for fuel. You are right that when you eat glucose, it goes directly into the blood to be used by your cells. Fructose heads to the liver where it's metabolized into lipids (fat). Here's where you went off track:  sucrose is a disaccharide, meaning it has two sugar molecules bonded together. Sucrose is 50/50 glucose and fructose. HFCS is 55% fructose, 41% glucose so the two really aren't that different. It's best to get your glucose from grains and avoid sugar altogether.  




 "You can be whatever you want to be."  Bullshit.  




 I had an awesome BK experience a couple of days ago. I put in my order for 2 whopper combos and I watched as my cashier overfill the French fry holders (what are they actually called, anyways?). He actually pounded the scooper and holder on the counter to get as many fries into the holder as he could. Then, after putting the fries and burgers in the bag, he took the scooper and dumped a bunch more fries into the bag. That has never happened before and may never happen to me again.

 There are a lot of social and financial factors at play. Essentially this is the result of cheap, easy debt and the 30 year mortgage. The price of something is set by how much somebody is willing to pay. If somebody is willing to spend 30 years paying for something and are able to get a loan with a monthly payment of upwards of 35% of their gross earnings, it will likely drive up the price of that item. And because the fed keeps the lending rate so low, banks can charge lower interest rates on mortgages. Does that mean people will lower their mortgage payments or be willing to pay a higher principal for homes? The latter. Again, this drives up the price of homes. 

But that money comes from some other part of the economy. Food, clothes, vacations, retail goods. All of these suffer.
