 Yeah! :) 




 Yeah, It happen in Normals too, but in like 9/10 ARAM I loose they say GG EASY xD. Its still nice to win, even if its only ARAM :) 




 Too bad you can't do this over the portal in survival -_- 




 LOL in every game I loose ARAM, the other team say GG Easy. Hate it... 




 This happend for me too bro. Lost 200+ LP. We lost almost every game due too leavers and flamers. In bronze, players think they gonna loose if enemy gets first blood or they are 4 kills after. Just if they dont flame and stay positive you can get some wins again. :)
