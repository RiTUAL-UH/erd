And this link in reddit has value = 17.5 kupvotes X $5.99 per/app (FOR LIMITED TIME ONLY) = 104.825$ . Not so bad for this type of marketing. 

















































 to be honest guys this thing doesn't look like 3D printer - I would say it's an old plotter
so next guy can hack 3D printer for ping pong player and beat the Chinese  














 doesn't work :( 




 I prefer castAR - for the price and the technology  









 soon will be available live satvideo - you can archive it for yourself

 28 hours to go
