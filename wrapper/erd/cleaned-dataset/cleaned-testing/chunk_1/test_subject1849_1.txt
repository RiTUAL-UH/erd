 "The Left hates the automobile because the automobile represents individual freedom and the Left hates freedom of any sort."

No. Most Democrats support manufacturing and domestic car manufacturing. To say that Liberals hate cars, isn't really the case. You may oppose a gas tax increase because it is a tax increase. Sure. People that want a gas tax increase to promote efficiency and pay the true cost of driving as stated in the article.

"For the leftist's ideal world, the roads would be reserved for government bureaucrats and leftist leaders while the disregarded masses would walk or take some form of overcrowded, filthy public transport."

Traffic tends to get really bad in city centers. Discouraging car usage is a good way to free up roadways. Freeing up Roadways increases car usage, so it is very inelastic in demand for car travel, which is good for slight tax increase because the deadweight loss is low. Look in the other countries with high gas taxes, people use public transit a lot and their infrastructure is considerably better than ours in many aspects. 

Yes, it will move some to public transit. Improving Public Transit and Putting Riders into Public Transit allows the government to make some revenues off of it. Also, it is environmentally friendly, since more people are placed in vehicles, so we don't waste excess energy in traffic or driving in excess to places, where you could have walked, take a bike, etc.  




 This isn't Appeal to Popularity. This is policy making and determining what most Americans want/support on an issue.

If the majority of Americans support legalizing marijuana, Is that Appeal to Popularity? No.  




 Yes, but conceding on Keystone will make the Republicans focus on Energy Regulations. They claim that Obama's high amounts of regulations are causing coal jobs to end in West Virginia, Kentucky, Appalachia, etc. Most Americans are opposed to removing regulations on pollution, toxic waste dumping, etc.  




 Not really. He should concede on Keystone, so Obama can have some agreement with the Republican Party on energy. Energy Production and Energy Extraction has been increasing under Obama's watch and it is helping the economy. Environmental Efficiency has been increasing as well. Politically, I can foresee Republicans using this potential veto in a a campaign to claim that Obama is "Anti-American Energy". During that last campaign cycle, Republicans used Keystone to claim Obama is anti-energy even though energy production has been increasing under his watch.

If Obama wanted to be bold, he should rather his position on TPP. 




 Bad Idea. I am pretty left on environmental issues, but I do know that more energy production and infrastructure is a good thing for America. 

Obama shouldn't veto Keystone. He should instead sign Keystone XL to show some bipartisanship. Why?

Republicans can't campaign against nor attack Obama on energy issues because they can't claim that Obama is anti-energy or his polices such as Keystone are the cause of rising gas prices. If gas prices start to rise in the next months and Obama did veto Keystone, How will Democrats, Liberals, and Obama respond to Republican Congress's claim that Obama is causing prices to rise?

Even if an Environmental Disaster occurs from Keystone, Obama can easily blame the GOP. After all, GOP wanted Keystone XL more than Democrats.  

Even though environmentalists will get angry from this, at least you will rally the base in 2016 and give candidates a chance to differentiate from the previous administration.  




 Either way, you can generalize that infrastructure spending in the stimulus is ranged from 50 to 100 billion dollars. It isn't most of the stimulus. It is definitely less than 25% of the stimulus 




 I wouldn't say all protectionism is bad. America up until the World Wars was on a protectionist policy. 




 Most people aren't advocating isolation. Most are just advocating for fair-trade standards. 




 Read what is in the Stimulus first: http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus?ref=economicstimulus 




 Honestly, just look at the detailed link of what the Stimulus was spent on.

http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus 




 Stimulus only provided at max 75 billion dollars for infrastructure depending the definition of infrastructure. There are tons of research and articles that will tell you how the Stimulus was spent. 1/3 of it was Tax Cuts. 1/3 was Health/Unemployment/Education/etc. 1/3 was random spending. 

By the way, our infrastructure is a 3 trillion dollar problem. 




 Farmers tend to use rail to send massive quantities of food stuff. I don't think mega farms are going to use truckers all the time.  




 Agreed. by the way, farmers tend to send massive food goods by rail. Trucks are used for short of medium distances to reach markets. 




 Infrastructure is mostly a government responsibility.  




 The problem of infrastructure is a 3.6 trillion dollar problem. The stimulus only addressed that problem with at max 100 billion dollars depending on the definition and criteria. 

http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/ 




 It was less than 100 billion dollars and in the range of 40 to 75 billion dollars.

http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus?ref=economicstimulus

It is not enough to address close to a 4 trillion dollar problem.

http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/  




 It was part of the Stimulus, if you didn't read the news back in 2009 to 2010 or looked into it. 

Here is how it was spent:

http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus?ref=economicstimulus

The infrastructure spending within the Stimulus is just minor patch to a major problem. Of course, we can't fix every problem, but less than 100 billion to fix a 3.6 trillion dollar problem isn't enough. 




 How does an ad hominem attack on Obama address Bernie's concern on infrastructure?

Obama's Stimulus was basically 1/3 Tax Cuts. 1/3 Health + Education + Unemployment Benefits. 1/3 Random other Government Spendings. 

http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus?ref=economicstimulus

Infrastructure Spending was only around 40 to 75 billion dollars in total depending on the definition of "infrastructure" in your own opinion.

It also provided some funding to build High Speed Rail, but most of the cash went to California, since states with Republican Governors rejected federal aid. 

By the way, repairing all infrastructure costs would cost 3.6 trillion dollars according to the American Society of Civil Enginners.

http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/

Clearly, the stimulus provided only minor patches to a major problem.  




 I want to see which members of Congress will oppose this.  




 Generally, European Workers cost more than American Workers with vacation times, paid leave, maternity leave, higher minimum wages, more private sector unions, etc. 

TTIP is more for Europeans to worry about, but we should worry about it as well, but the anti-free trade agreement with TTIP has less points than with TPP. If anything, TTIP might bring jobs to America, while TPP, might outsource American jobs overseas.  




 It is easy to pack Democratic voters in to small districts because they tend to be densely populated or live in urban areas.  




 TTIP has a lot of benefits for Americans, so a lot of Americans aren't actually against this freetrade deal. Both regions are relatively similar in standards, so once we sign the deal, massive outsourcing won't necessarily take place. America compared to Europe has lower cost of productions in many areas some European Jobs will mostly likely be outsourced to America, but at a lesser rate than American Jobs to developing countries. 









 She should tell the truth in a way that doesn't make her look bad because you can't fully survive on a pure pro-Obama statement, when most of Kentucky disapprove of him. She could have responded back to the reporter and ask her, "Who did you support?" 




 I don't think it is the case with Mexico in NAFTA.

1. Mexican Illegal Immigration hasn't slowed as a result from NAFTA, even though promoters of the trade deal said so. People, who don't like manufacturing and are former farmers, migrated to America. 

I don't need evidence, since conservatives have been complaining about the increase in illegal immigration for awhile now.

2. Mexican Government isn't stable. The area is very hostile, violent, corrupt, and there is no signs of standard of living improvement.

I don't need evidence to prove this because there has been many gangs, violence, etc reported from the area. It is already widely known that Mexico has a lot of violent problems. 




 Big Businesses do have an easier access to the global market than small businesses, but it isn't corporate welfare unless the government is actually subsidizing to have the transfer of jobs to the region.

They have the ability to all market expansion and do cost-cutting measures.  




  False Dilemma

It is the same thing.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma

Either-Or fallacy works as well.

Sometimes those yes or no questions have motivations.

For example:

When a reporter asked Grimes whether or not she supported Obama, Grimes was put in a lose-lose situation. The reporter clearly had a motivation. Grimes should have sent back an either or fallacy question. 




 It may be advancement but the conditions in the industrial manufacturing Mid-West is so bad.

Those cities never had the ability to slower transfer to new industries. The former union workers and manufacturing workers are still struggling in cities such as Fint, Detroit, Gary, Buffalo, etc  




 I don't think there is a motivation agenda behind the pro-trade idea. There is tons of evidence to suggest that more trade = good, but it doesn't mean that sometimes protectionism can be better than trade. 

 




 If we continue with this "free-trade" process, soon we will sign free-trade agreements with every country to bring all countries's domestic prices to world price equilibrium. 

If all Domestic Prices are equal to the World Price, then what happens next? There is no gains from trade since every opportunity cost of creating a good somewhere else in the world is equal.

Usually, in free-trade agreements is basically abolishing national borders and national protectionism without actually abolishing sovereign borders itself.

Since, Free-Trade is so good. Shouldn't America be attempting to sign free-trade agreements with China, Russia, Iran, African Union, etc to allow low tariffs, easy transfer of laborers, etc?

Clearly, if we do so with those "hostile" or underdeveloped or growing countries, we could ease tensions, produce goods at lower costs over there, and "contain" the growing markets by making our businesses invest over there. 




 Actually you do. NYC and LA are giant metro areas. 1 team would completely monopolize a regional market, which isn't good.  




 Perot did support Romney in the last election. Probably, he felt that Romney was moderate enough for him when Romney was Governor. Though, I can't understand why he would think Romney is more moderate than Obama. 




 Sometimes, Questions can't be yes or no. it is False Dilemma when people can have multiple views, moderate views, agree with differences, disagree with differences, or concession with differences. 




 Interestingly, Ross Perot would be identified as a moderate liberal by today's standards.

http://www.ontheissues.org/Ross_Perot.htm 




 This trade deal will be important in this new Congress. This trade deal along with Obamacare, Foreign Policy/Military, Impeachment, Keystone, Benghazi, etc will be discussed from this GOP majority in the legislative branch.  









 To create drugs and new advances in medicine, it is usually best in competition rather than a single government controlling the findings. A lot of drugs and medicine have patents because those cover the cost of investment and time to find new advances in drugs/medicine/etc.

Of course, I agree that the all of society should be covered by healthcare. I just don't necessarily agree with the single-payer format.  




 I know but Healthcare isn't a natural
Monopoly, so there isn't a need for socialism in the insurance market or services in general.

From wikipedia "Automobile manufacturing became the largest industry segment in the US, and the largest ever created; the US auto industry was many times larger than the automotive industries of the rest of the world combined.[2] By 1960, one-sixth of working Americans were employed directly or indirectly by the industry, but automation and imports eroded the need for such a large workforce within a couple of decades. The 1950s were the pinnacle of American automotive manufacturing and helped shape the United States into an economic superpower." 

Of course, you can claim that wikipedia is not a primary source, but it does have source links on itself. It still summarizes the details well enough to understand the basic point. 

There, you have all the citations. 




 Single Payer would put too much accountability on the central government and states. It could lead to corruption. I don't support that, but I support mandated healthcare insurance or a public option vs private option.

 1. Our Agriculture Businesses were able to put some Mexican Agriculture businesses out of the market. Those workers had to either work in the factories or find some other opportunities. Many come illegally in search of better opportunities. Since NAFTA, Mexican economic/social climate, the new manufacturing jobs and social conditions aren't better than jobs and social conditions that they had before. 

2. You are talking about the producer and consumer surpluses, right? I understand that. It is just a transfer of welfare. If migration doesn't harm the US or Mexico, why do conservatives complain about the mass migration illegals?

3. For your third point, if you look at the graph, the trade deficit increased throughout the mid to late 1990s. In 1995, after we past NAFTA, we started to have a negative trade balance. It is -15,808.3 (add in the graph's key) compared to +1,349.8 (add in the graph's key) in 1994. Every year since to now, it has grown to -67,000 at its height. Those are HUGE number differences.

"It only ballooned in the 2000's, so tough to blame Clinton for this, right?"

Also, Clinton, Some Pro-Trade Democrats, and the majority of Republicans in Congress past NAFTA. I only blame the policy, but people, who agreed on it, each share a piece of the blame. 

4. Ya. Obviously, if you allow trade without guidelines, tariffs, quotas, etc. Then, businesses will obviously outsource. I agree with your next statement. 

5. Yes. Also, true, but it also causes a huge economic declines in the Rust Belt of America.

6. Most manufacturing jobs were already unionized and were middle class jobs in the 20th century. In order for the workers to compete, they would have to reduce their wages and cut benefits, which in turn made them lower class. Some had to leave to retail jobs, which have less pay than their manufacturing jobs.  




 Yes. That is also true for some, but they don't have the enough political power to discriminate the majority or others like many conservative politicians throughout America. There are tons of examples. 




 The effective tax rate would still be higher than today's effective tax rate. If the marginal income tax today is 30%-ish, Why do we still have debates on loopholes? Nobody pays 30%. Many pay less than 30% and sometimes have a negative tax rate. With a high marginal tax rate of 90%, Wouldn't you expect an effective tax rate higher than today's effective tax rate? 




 Ya. They try to get party unity on votes.  




 True. Not all republicans are racist, but you can not deny that the Solid South excluding cities and minority areas are all Republican dominated now. Also, the Solid South is known for having some social groups based on hating minorities in the past and today-ish. Those groups wouldn't necessarily vote Democrat in today's politics.  




 A whip is basically a party's main person to gather/rally members to support/vote/agree on the majority of the party's views on a issue.

Ron Paul is definitely more economically conservative than Hillary and Obama.

 How about John Tower (R) Senator from Texas, who voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964?

Why do Republicans cite Byrd to claim that Democrats = racist when obviously when 99%+ of all southern Republicans and southern Democrats opposed Civil Rights? 









 Ron Paul is more rightwing than Obama and Clinton on economic issues. He is only left of them on social issues in some cases and on some Constitutional practices.  




 George HW Bush, Al Gore, and Clinton promoted that NAFTA will reduce illegal immigration, export more goods to Mexico, and create more "jobs". 

Today: Illegal Immigration increased. Trade Deficit with Mexico Increased. Many Manufacturing Jobs left America.  




 The Parties are different. it is just that both are influenced by some similar sources. To change, you either vote lesser or two evils, primary the establishment, or vote 3rd party - (not the best option on change depending on the outcomes) 




 I don't think it is much. The stimulus only provided only around 50 billion dollars to 75 billion dollars on infrastructure.
 
American Society of Civil Engineers states that the government needs to spend 3+ trillion dollars to fix every problem, but we know that is not achievable.  




 the word Chiefs isn't really "native american" per say fully. You can have a "chiefs" name and random logo of a strong figurative leader. I do agree that MLS should stay away from logos that are Native American based.

 Not necessarily. Spending on Public Works Projects boosts demand for Manufacturing Products and American resources such as Steel. Those projects provide medium term union construction jobs because repairs take longer than building pipelines. Also, those resource demand can build public transit/repair highways/introduce competition to the very profitable airlines via rail transit, which will increase mobility and boost efficiency in travel.

 "compassionate conservative might see the social problems of the United States, such as health care or immigration, as issues that are better solved through cooperation with private companies, charities and religious institutions rather than directly through government departments." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassionate_conservatism

You are using a hard-core definition of what it means for a conservative to be a RINO. George Bush was Neo-Con as well. Patriot Act, Illegal Spying, Tripling the Deficit, etc came with the need to fight wars in Afghanistan and the fear of WMDs in Iraq. Cutting Taxes is also a conservative position, which reduced expected increases in revenues, which in combination with military spending, created more deficits. We do not have Open Borders with Mexico. We do have one with Canada. "Big Government" was the result of increased military spending and general increases in revenue/spending based on population growth. 

George Bush is still an establishment conservative, but more moderate leaning on some issues than the typical modern conservative. As evident in this link:

http://www.ontheissues.org/George_W__Bush.htm 




 I agree. I wish more politicians would address the issue of rail transportation. We haven't heard much since 2010's Obama/Biden's HSR proposal.  




 Bush isn't a progressive. Bush was a compassionate conservative. "compassionate" is another meaning for moderate without being labeled as a "leftwing progressive" or "RINO" or "socialist" and still be considered a normal conservative.  




 Just a thought. America funds a lot for airports and highways/roads/cars for domestic transportation. Why is Amtrak still behind in competitiveness? 




 I think MLS needs more color diversity.

Green, Orange, Purple, Yellow, Brown needs to be better represented.  




 Not even. Jeb Bush is a populist leaning conservative on most issues. 

http://www.ontheissues.org/Jeb_Bush.htm

He is still at best 90% the same as an establishment conservative. 




 It is worth to have a discussion because economic policy is always debateable. After all, since free-trade is so beneficial, Shouldn't America negotiate more free-trade agreements with India, African Union, more South American Countries, Russia, Iran, Iraq, etc? Every country has a comparative advantage is something, right? 




 I think people have the wrong definition of populism.

Populists are people, who are economically liberal and socially conservative. 

Progressives/Liberal are people, who are economically liberal and socially liberal.

Note: There were Progressive Republicans in the early 20th century to mid 20th century. 




 "a course in economics" meaning that I taken basic microeconomics and macroeconomic courses. As you can see my link in one of my comments, I can understand that gains from trade graph. Of course, there are many other factors when countries trade for goods. Also, I could be proven wrong by people, who study more economics than me.  




 um... This trade process has been occurring since forever. Many products move from country to country.  




 It is on WikiLeaks 




 Ya. Of Course, In any economics textbook, Comparative Advantage of Trading benefits both countries. Though, I wonder what area Americans are specializing in. Probably, High-Tech and Science, but ya.  




 I agree. Gore, Clinton, and HW Bush pushed the idea that NAFTA will create more jobs, end illegal immigration, increase American exports. These are lies. The American Trade Deficit increased with Mexico. illegal Immigration increased. Manufacturing Jobs declined throughout the 90s.  I know where these Pro-Free experts get their evidence from. It appears in any economics textbook with this simple graph. Of course, the majority of economists are pro-trade. Some are pro-protectionism.

Example: http://welkerswikinomics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/gains-from-trade_2.jpeg
 




 It is simple Supply and Demand Graph. It can applied for any business market. 




 I agree. I tend to not agree with those textbooks data and evidence, but a lot of economists would say that Pro-Free Trade = Good 




 I have taken a course in economics. American Produces lose some Producer Surplus because they can't compete with low prices of the world market. American Consumers gain Consumer Surplus because they can get cheaper goods. The producer surplus loss and the consumer surplus gain is basically a transfer of surplus within the original economy. The consumers, who can access cheaper goods below equilibrium now from trade, adds to the consumer surplus. It is shown by the triangle in the graph.

http://welkerswikinomics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/gains-from-trade_2.jpeg

Of course, I think those economics textbooks promote that free-trade "can" improve surpluses/welfare/etc

They cite tariffs as causing more dead-weight losses and hinder ability to a competitive free-trade market. 




 Supposedly in economics, if the World Production Costs and Price of goods are lower than America's production and product prices, then free-trade actually benefits the consumers of America through trade. Consumers could expand overall surplus. The American producers are the ones, who will suffer.

Example: http://welkerswikinomics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/gains-from-trade_2.jpeg

 I recently got out of my budget crisis/recession. I borrowed a lot for economic growth earlier in the game 10 times of $200,000. In the crisis, I tried to cut services and raise taxes. Basically, I used 20% on everything except for low income residential, low income business, and high tech. For spending, I cut education, police, healthcare, parks, and roads. I maintained power, fire, water, trash, and public transit.  I used a lot of "weaknesspays" to maintain surpluses, if I went into the negative range. Now, I got out of the big time crash with some BIG time business boom, since I had 90,000+ people before and after this mess.

I want to know your plan of action. How do you survive your crisis?
