 ...would they be injecting the water if they weren't fracking? 

And could they frack as cheaply without injecting the water somewhere? If so, why don't they? 

It just seems arbitrary for the public to make the distinction between the fracking process and the fracking wastewater disposal process causing the quakes. It's not like the latter happens without the former... 




 That's probably the stupidest argument I've ever heard. 

And I've spent a lot of time on reddit, so that's really saying something. 

It's like saying "If smoking causes cancer, why don't terrorists just start giving out cigarettes!? Since they're not, obviously smoking doesn't cause cancer!"  




 From a [comment 10 minutes ago, in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/35l2mw/whats_causing_texas_earthquakes_fracking_most/cr5ro87?context=3): 

When they stop fracking the quakes stop, when they start fracking the quakes start again. It can't be a coincidence. The other day we had a 4.0 the other day and we have had some gas mains explode because of this and people lost their lives and their homes. Our gas mains are old and need replaced before they can handle all the movement.
 




 Not much little about it!

 I do what I can. 

Turns out when you read dozens of articles a day and submit the best, you rack up teh karmaz.  




 Need a little more .jpg. 

Also, that'd be a cool template for one of those post-it note wall murals!  




 Me too. It's a little pixelated as my desktop though... 


















































































































 Thanks, Penny

I lost my shit there. 

Not only because it works so well in the pasta, and i'm honored to get the kenny pasta, but also because my aunt Penny insists that I was named after her because my initials are PEN.  




 Yep. Removed because technically it's not an official gov't report (and obviously not a study) but instead a data update. 




 Haha no, it's just my favorte /r/shittyanimalfacts name for them.

 This is the first time it stayed there for a whole month.

 Hard to say for sure, but the scientific literature suggests 350ppm... 
























 Yeah well "Foxes actually make great cock house guards" just didn't have quite the same ring...  




 Oh and [about the 2/3rds number](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-06-26/climate-change-and-the-two-thirds-imperative): 

The two-thirds imperative was enunciated in the 2012 edition of the IEAs annual World Energy Outlook: No more than one-third of proven reserves of fossil fuels can be consumed prior to 2050 if the world is to achieve the 2 degrees C goal 




 According to the[ Congressional Research Service](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/just-how-dirty-are-canadas-oil-sands-anyway/2012/05/23/gJQAGdlkkU_blog.html): 

oil from tar sands produces 14 to 20 percent more carbon emissions than other oil the U.S. imports.

So no, this is not a clean fuel alternative. But please, don't let facts keep you from rationalizing and grasping for straws... 




 Yeah I honestly expected some right-wing outrage about a foreign company using big government to steal private property of ordinary Americans, but by and large it's only the locals who seem to care (on the conservative side anyway.)  




 The point is that the science is telling us we need to leave 2/3rds of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground. 

How, then, does it make sense to build NEW fossil fuel infrastructure? 

It's like your doctor telling you to go on a diet, and instead you sign up for a rewards card at Cinnabon. 

And I don't think anyone (well informed) thinks stopping KXL will have a major effect on the industry. But it's like the divestment campaign, it's meant to revoke their social license to operate. 




 The Jargon-Believability relationship is a strong one. With your formal training, there is great shitty potential. 

I don't know the fancy names for things (and am too lazy to look up), so I just resort to using nature documentary syntax to make them believable. 




 If the pipeline doesn't make it cheaper to transport the oil, why would they build it? 

Do you really think the industry that knows it's destroying the climate but continues anyway is pushing a pipeline on environmental grounds, and not for its profit?  




 Binomial Nomenclature shitty? 

You're raising the bar here...  




 Yeah, I get it. Next time I'll try and use an ellipses then, thanks.   




 Okay, I just deleted an irrelevant portion of the quote for length. Not that it really matters since the post isn't going anywhere, but is that not ok? 

I left a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3521fl/stanfords_jon_krosnick_on_climate_change_most/cr06cji) with the full quote, which as you can see doesn't differ in substance from my title...

 80% of Americans  I never see 80% of Americans agreeing on anything when it comes to other issues, so this is very unusual  believe the federal government should limit greenhouse gas emissions by businesses and in particular by public utilities.

I know rules are rules, but it seems like editing out a side thought shouldn't be worth removing the post... 




 Sadly, it was the other way around. Not long after this photo was taken, the rooster savagely murdered and ate the fox. 

This lie brought to you by /r/shittyanimalfacts.

 The drawing of someone holding one makes me have to ask: 

How long until we get all Jurassic Park-y and have designer dinosaurs as pets? 

Alternate question: Assuming we're already in Jurassic Park times where you can have any dinosaur, which one would you choose to keep as a pet?
