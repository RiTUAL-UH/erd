 Who is your favorite character in any show and why is it Oberyn Martell? 




 No problem man! I agree with your thoughts on the "lack of realisation" by peers. I always feel like I'm the only one actually contemplating this stuff whilst everyone else is caught up in things like religion as you say. I am not trying to offend religion or say that God does not exist in any way but I feel like a lot of people get scared of stuff like this and religion or the idea of a God is an easy solution. You've gone the hard route by truly contemplating one of the scariest things which is the mere meaning of existence. It is not at all irrational to have this anxiety. I think curiosity and contemplation of the universe should take form in awe and excitement rather than anxiety. Just because its uncomprehending doesn't necessarily mean its scary or a bad thing :) 




 Yeah! It's when you think to yourself "I'm really tired I'm just gonna have a quick lie down" that you always end up napping. I mean I never lie down whilst tired and then after 5 minutes go "Okay, thats that done!" I always end up waking up 2 hours later feeling like death. 

This thread actually reminded me that when I got my first panic attacks when I was younger it was always during/after naps. I would go in this kind of delirious/ sleepwalking state and walk around the house saying really weird stuff like "where am I?" to my family whilst crying. They would try and calm me down then I would wake up later having no recollection of it. 

I guess napping wasn't built for everyone! Anyway I actually think its a good thing because it makes you more productive. One of my friends naps all the time and never gets anything done, also makes him stay up later at night procrastinating. Its good to have a stable sleep cycle.  




 bro! I have the exact same thing. After watching that video with the new picture of amdromeda where it slowly zooms in i felt like i was gonna have a panic attack. It seriously puts everything into perspective making u feel extremely insignificant yet at the same time significant by your mere existence. I also find it funny because most people on this subreddit have things like social anxiety or health anxiety yet I also have this like existential anxiety, its usually worse at night when you're lying in bed just questioning everything. It is literally the most terrifying thing when you truly sit down and try and comprehend your own existence and existence of anything in general. Even typing this now I'm beginning to feel a bit weird.

HOWEVER. At the same time its fucking awesome that we are all in this crazy boat together. I mean in the complete and utterly incomprehensible face of it all, we still get up every day and go about our business and try and lead meaningful lives. 

The way I look at it is that you are not an insignificant thing INSIDE the universe but you literally ARE the universe contemplating itself. You are this big badass scary thing, that is you! 


I'm literally going on a tangent here just getting excited about all this crazy stuff :) One last thing though, I seriously recommend you listen/watch some Alan Watts videos. He is like a psychiatrist for all existential induced anxiety. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I -Thats a good one. 

:) hope u feel better 




 Dude! Every time I nap I literally wake up in physical pain. I get so jealous of my friends who always can take naps but I literally can't. I wake up feeling like I've been in a coma or been knocked out, I have no idea where I am, my teeth feel horrific and even if i brush them they still feel weird like they are covered in sugar and i get a pounding headache.It literally will make me feel bad for the rest of the day until I actually go to sleep. fuck naps bro! 




 That was way sadder than I was expecting :( Is there no like ending to the book? I feel like all the stuff with the mice was just dropped.  




 Whats wrong with the 5th book? 




 I am about to finish the fourth book in the hitchhikers series. While I loved the first few I feel like they have gotten progressively worse. I feel like nothing even happens in the fourth book. Is it worth reading the fifth? What are everyone else thoughts? 




 If you could have one thing now that would make you happier, what would it be? 




 You look like Christopher Nolan. 




 This truly made me feel the significance of that quote about whether or not we are alone are both equally terrifying. I mean after looking at that picture how can you say we are alone? That is one glimpse of one speck in the universe and it seems utterly and unfathomably gigantic. Yet at the same time, the thought that even amongst the sheer size of the universe, we are alone makes me feel like I could explode from incomprehension. I am one of 7 billion. 7 billion. That number is so small in the grand scheme of things that it practically does not exist. Trillions of stars and billions of galaxies. I actually exist. I am one of the 7 billion and I am proud to be part of the 7 billion.
