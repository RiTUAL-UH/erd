 I recently rewatched D R, and reviewed that in the final moments of GNR, her neck gets sliced and splatters a stream of blood across part of the surface of the moon.  In D R, this shown starting at time-code [1:15:56].

Is this not the same streak of blood we see in the Rebuilds - supporting the theory that they are a sequel of events? 




 Throughout the shows, we have seen the candidates/children as well as the EVA's numbered.  I recently noticed by the end of Rebuild 3, that some of the candidates also have Greek alphabet designations on the backs of their uniforms.

1. Shinji:  (alpha symbol on his back), meaning first, or in astronomy the brightest
2. ? I didn't notice who had beta.
3. Asuka:  (gamma symbol on her back), meaning third, or in astronomy the third brightest

In terms of "order", this contradicts who is 1st candidate/child, 3rd candidate/child, and so on.  Anyone else notice this or have any thoughts on it?

 Problem:

* Apparently Pangu doesn't like something in your iPhone profile and can't continue the Jailbreak - even though the Pangu app has been injected on your phone.  Try as many times as you want, but its never getting passed "dump caches failed" (red question marks with the progress meter at stopped 10~20%).

Solution:

1. Perform a "Clean Recovery" and create a new iPhone profile
2. Retry Pangu per instructions
3. ...
4. Profit!

HTH.  I tried everything else recommended in this subreddit, and online forums.  As soon as I tried with a fresh profile, it worked perfectly. 




 Today, case-in-point, two emergency vehicles are going north San Vincente in the 55 zone.  My traffic group is coming to a stop at Stocker St with the emergency vehicles approaching from behind.  I can see and hear them approaching.  I'm in the center lane at the head of the line, but I leave room in front of my car so I can let the guy in the front left lane pull to the right to let the emergency vehicles through.

He doesnt do it.

I yell to him in his car, trying to get his attention over the fact that he's listening to headphones.  He finally takes them off, takes a moment to open and start eating a Redvine, listens twice more to what I have been repeatedly trying to tell him - and then he tells me to "calm down."

I tell him, "dude, I left you space in front of my car so you can get out of the way!"  Meanwhile, there are other people in my lane pleading with other cars in the left lane behind me to move out of the way of the emergency vehicles.  He stares at me and will not move until all the other cars behind him have moved - wasting precious minutes for the emergency vehicles.

What the fuck is wrong with people? 



























































 They made a point to show that Asuka notices that she has similar bandages on her fingers, although not to the extent of Rei.  We saw a bit of what Rei was going through, but what happened with Asuka?  Why the girls, and not Shinji - if its a pilot-thing? 




























































































































 I almost wouldn't mind if it did its thing in the morning, but its going off for apparently no reason in the middle of the night.  Thanks for any and all ideas! 






















































 1. No mentions of anything AoS-related
2. There are the standard (2) tags after the movie: serious/continuity-related mid-credits, and a fan service one post-credits. 
3. I highly recommend AoS fans see this movie in continuity order.

Feel free to AMA, provided you use spoiler tags where applicable.  









 'nuff said 




 1. anagram of the word "keys".
1. anagram of the word "syke", and is a common misspelling of "psych" in English. In Finnish is means "pulse" or "heartbeat". 
1. a fancy way of writing "sky".
1. "Sky" in Italian is "Cielo", which can sound similar to "cello" when when spoken. (I'm not implying anything here - it just sounds similar to me)

Personally, I'm a fan of #1 since she is so adept at getting into computer systems.
 









 [In a reply to comments on another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/shield/comments/20rebg/new_clairvoyant_theory_may_contain_spoilers/cg6ir2s), I started to self-analyze background opinions I have been having since the T.A.H.I.T.I. episode, which have lead me to a branch of the original theory.

I came to the theory that Nick Fury left documentation clues about the location of Coulson's operation and the Guest House that specifically required a human interaction/element to decipher.  It wasn't anything that could be data-scraped/deciphered in a programmatic way. It required holographic projection and visual analysis of an image.  To oversimplify, this to me seems similar to a [CAPTCHA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) to inhibit programmatic automation from scraping the data.

So to summarize, The Clairvoyant couldn't see information about Coulson's operation past what would require human interaction and perception.

Following this theory, it makes me lean toward a technologically-based intelligence being at the root of the big bad.

Thoughts?

EDIT: grammar fix, changed "passed" to "past"
