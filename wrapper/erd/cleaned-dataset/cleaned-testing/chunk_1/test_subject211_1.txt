 I've been a member of theistic satanism for a little under a year now. [Here's a helpful list of demons](http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/HELP.html) And [How to summon them](http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/DEMONOLATRY.html) 




 I would choose half-life 3 and release the Game files to everyone on the internet. Hey, I might go to prison but HL3 would come at last. 




 You should post this to /r/techsupportgore 




 Oh my god. I remember this. It is sooooooo hilarious. 




 I want to get into the game as it seems fun but I know nothing of how to get into it. What do I do first? Buy a set? what set would you recommend for a beginner? Do I need any special knowledge to host a game with some friends or would it all be in the manual? How much would it cost? 




 I'm prettyy sure he was gonna do HL2 regardless  




 I do, just thought everyone would like to see this. 









 My guess is that this is some kind of attempt at having an english name. I know in many parts of asia it's considered high class to use a little english inter-mixed with whatever the local language is. This was probably some proverb or something with shoddy translation. 




 Marcus. Fallout 2 




 I snapped the UE up for $3 during the last summer sale. It could've been that or an overpriced coffee from starbucks that morning. I was happy with my choice. 




 Pfft peasants

I. Won. 




 I admit defeat. 




 The hammer and sickle design was the symbol of the soviet union representing the two main jobs in the union and giving power to the proletariat.

China never had that design. Also. I'm not even sure if the soviet union ever existed in the fallout universe meaning that that symbol might not even exist.

Anyone who saw you with it would thing your crazy.

Just saying :/  




 Thanks! I'm gonna experiment with adding other custom sounds for other playthrough's. Thanks so much!

 How to change hit sounds? I'm currently playing a game with an un-armed character called Ken. Fist of the north rawr. Using the fist of the north rawr gauntlet as my weapon to destroy my enemies.

My question is this. How do I change the sound a weapon makes upon contact with an NPC? I looked in my steam FO:NV folder and couldn't find a folder for weapon sounds. If anyone knows than it would be much appreciated to tell me how.

(I plan on changing the hit sound for the fist of the north rawr weapon to the fast punching sound from the fist of the north star movie.) 




 That's it. Your story's over. You've walked out of the land of the living and into the halls of history and legend. (Of course you could also try another playthrough for a new faction.) 




 /r/Fallout 




 ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN! CHOO CHOO 




 "FOR CANADA!" 




 I bet a laser pistol would turn out awesome. You might also try to make T-51 B or T-45 D Power helmet. 




 Speech. Speech is the most over powered skill in any game ever. 




 Mass effect? this is my decision making in real life 




 If I were you I would forgo the risk of software/hardware incompatibilities in the the future and print all the photo's on some high quality paper, Dig a hole in the ground. Put the paper in a waterproof and lightproof container, bury it and come back in 40 years 




 To me this doesn't sound like a problem. 




 [This](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/The_Nearly_Ultimate_Fallout_2_Guide) Is a pretty good guide that doesn't spoil the game to much. 




 Shoot me a PM, I can't say I'd be much help as an editor as my grammer is quite horrible but I consider myself rather knowledgeable in terms of lore. 




 This is not the suggestions thread. this for the challenge's posted above. 




 Try updating your video drivers sadly I can't direct you to the website you would do that at as that list is a list of possible specs and not absolute ones.

But say you got the model with the GeForce GT625 2GB then try searching "GeForce GT625 2GB video driver updates" into google without the quotation marks. To find out which card you have open up your start bar and right click on "My computer" on the drop down menu click properties and the window that comes up should have an option somewhere that says "Device manager"* click on that and expand the menu that says display adapters. Take the name that appears there and search google for video driver updates for that card. Install the updates and all of your games will run smoother not only NV.

*If your using win 8 then use [this guide](http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows-8/a/device-manager-windows-8.htm) 




 This sounds like a pretty good idea. And once fallout 4 is released and a large influx of new people start playing 3/NV then it could serve as some form of guide for beginners.

I might as well contribute a tip myself.

Whenever your going through the wasteland at early levels, always pick up any junk you see so long as it doesn't over encumber you. You can always sell it for some caps. Even seemingly worthless things like dinner plates can help you when your saving up for that new gun.

 Mother ship zeta is my favorite FO3 DLC and Old world blues is my favorite DLC ever. Maybe it's something about using all those sci-fi weapons but for some reason I've always been attracted to those DLC out of the bunch that were released for 3 and NV.  




 TIL that most of the worlds military's eat better than me. 




 Not quite as good as a horse but quite fun lookling. 




 The unfinished jeb. 




 Holy shit, this kangaroo is better looking then me.
