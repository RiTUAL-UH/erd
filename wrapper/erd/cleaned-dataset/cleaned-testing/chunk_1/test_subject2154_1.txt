 The Shabazz hangover. 




 Sweet 16 game, but basically haha. When that game started I was the only one at my house watching. By the time it ended there were 15 people there shouting at the TV 




 Only reason I like this right now is because I want Davidson in. VCU hopefully you guys figure it out in the next week and a half 




 Yesss it's a beautiful thing. Our finals week was always the first week of the tournament...which sounds awful. But then take into consideration that I never had a final later than Tuesday afternoon for those quarters = I'm free all week to watch all the games, plus Spring Break the week after. It was pretty much perfect haha 




 Agree it's worth reading, it's just way easier to find the scores for the bubble teams if they use a button on the scores page. 




 Jeez. Does Nantz realize no one likes him anyway? 




 Look a bit down the thread, it's been discussed 




 You're a champ. I just graduated, I remember balancing finals and March (we were on quarter system). Just think of all the wonderful basketball that awaits when you get through em 




 I see why it's done though. Reward the best teams in the regular season, make it mean more. I'd argue that has at least something to do with why the Horizon has made so much noise in the Big Dance recently. 




 Damn that's a tease. Hope he's alright and that he gets to play next week. 




 He cried? I thought he just daydreamed for a bit 




 bahahaha best manifest destiny joke ever 




 LOL YOU ALL LIVE THERE IT'S 77 DEGREES IN SAN DIEGO TODAY 




 SHE IS A SAINT, YOU HEAR ME, A SAINT 




 Gotcha. What does he use to weight it? 




 Best thing about it is we'll get to find out! I love TJ for you guys though, and Stanley Johnson is the truth, he went to high school near me. I don't wish you bad luck at all 




 I guess I don't understand this as well as I'd like. How does he adjust it exactly if you don't mind me asking? 




 Did anyone see Sacred Heart-Bryant? Double OT, huge shots back and forth. ITS MARCH AND IM SO EXCITED 




 I think Mercer left?

Yeah they went to the SoCon 




 Just a feeling I have. Really am not that high on them this year. No flow offensively. 




 Bill Walton is amazing, no idea what you're talking about

 




 I'm pretty sure the CIT is what you have to pay to play in. They even have a fancy sales-y brochure. http://collegeinsider.com/CIT2015/ 




 Oh totally. I mostly threw that in there to praise the job Archie Miller has done at Dayton. He's had a phenomenal stretch there the past 2 seasons, and he should be getting more hype for COTY awards. 




 This sounds so fun. 




 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXe-zJDZGIE) 




 Bitch he's Frank Mason 




 No one in the Pac 12 makes it out of the first weekend. 




 Teams would still be unlikely to do it, given that taking a spot in an empty game means someone seeded lower than you is guaranteed to play you.

And in the cases that it does happen, it would be exciting as hell. And if you really deserve the higher seed, go beat them anyway. 




 This makes me feel like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHtlnWNkma8 




 "Who would've thought having 0 capable players over 6'7" would turn out poorly in D1 college basketball?"

Survey says: http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/roster/_/id/2168/dayton-flyers 




 He's referring to the power-conference/his own mindset towards mid-majors. 




 http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000427085/article/larry-foote-jim-harbaugh-isnt-leaving-nfl-for-michigan

Was talked about more than a month in advance. As soon as it became clear he might not be coaching the 49ers, Michigan was discussed as a possible destination.

Anyway, this is a college basketball thread. I'd love to see Stevens back in college, it just ain't happening in the near future. 




 Except everyone knew that there was a good chance Harbaugh would go to Michigan. 




 I love that your bracket seeds small conference winners over a lot of the at-large teams. To me, this is how it should be, because a lot of those teams deserve to be given that respect. 




 But not on the list of games for each team, where he provides the number of possessions the game had.  




 Well actually..http://kenpom.com/blog/index.php/weblog/entry/the_pre-season_ap_poll_is_great 




 The more I think about it the more I feel that Nantz isn't gonna let Raftery talk and I'll hate Nantz even more. 




 I'm so torn by this.

Raff finally getting to do a Final Four will be awesome. Splitting up him and Verne makes me wanna cry. 




 Flashbacks to Dayton-Ohio State last year. Which was also fun as hell. 




 Wofford's no joke 




 I read this to the rhythm of the Rock Chalk chant and it made me giggle at work. 




 Lol you're very much on the bubble.

EDIT: totally thought that was IU flair. 




 Can Indiana fans stop with the Brad Stevens wishing? It's not gonna happen. 




 I'm rooting for Albany because I remember them being in the game against Florida last year with 5 minutes to go. 




 It has been for the past 5 minutes 




 He does that every game, it's comical 




 That was a textbook finish in transition to ward off the shot blockers. We're cookin here 




 Mostly laugh. 




 lol Stevens is not coming. Put that one to bed. 




 Thing is he really doesn't care about his skillset. Question is will someone pay him (read: take him in the 1st round).

Doesn't look like it right now that's for sure 




 Is that not every game? 




 Is Mosquera-Perea staying though? 




 Fuuuun. At least we get to laugh watching him coach. 




 It's games like this that make me wish I paid for cable. 




 What's his contract situation? 




 The intensity of the Big Dance is there for the small conference tournaments, cuz they know they're basically in the Dance already at that point: it's win or go home. 




 Well, you do get the tournament at home 




 Am I the only one who gets almost more excited for the small conference tournaments?

At least I trick myself into thinking that every year and then the Big Dance starts and I watch 16 games in a day and I spend the rest of the day screaming about how oh so wrong I was. 




 I love your team and Tony Bennett by the way. I'm just saying, you don't get much credit for adjusting to something you knew was coming. 




 What about Syracuse is tricky? Did you guys not know they'd come out running the same defense they've run for almost 40 years? 




 That's a generous interpretation 




 Don't get too dizzy spinning that hard. 




 I mean if you like being salty. 




 Score 2 points in 13 minutes? 




 Oh, SDSU too. 




 Point taken. You know your schedule better than I do, what quality teams have you played that are low-tempo this year? I can think of Utah and Gonzaga. Which to be fair, Gonzaga took you guys to OT at McKale where no one wins, and Utah I think is a little overrated.

I mean, that's one way to look at the strategy of a low-tempo offense. The more positive spin is that you're working to get the best possible shot and you're willing to let the shot clock run down to get that shot, working to get the little inefficiencies to stack up in your favor over the course of a possession through ball movement, cuts, and screens. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle of those two viewpoints. 




 I know it's not my team, but it's gotta be pretty hard to stay angry at Kemba and Shabazz. 




 Right, that's exactly what I mean. A team that's comfortable playing at a low-tempo offensively will be less dissuaded by Arizona slowing them down, especially if that team is still efficient offensively, like Northern Iowa is.

Agree with you about Stanley Johnson though. You need him going. Entirely different team based on how he's playing. 




 At best they show an ability to go high tempo if the game calls for it. Their Tempo numbers on KenPom right now are propped up by their games with Oregon and games against bad teams. 




 Obviously a lot of 1 and 2 seeds are gonna be picked. They're supposed to be the best teams. But there's years where they get picked, idk, 75% of the time and years where they get picked 90% of the time. I'd love to see the difference. 




 **Life Itself, by Roger Ebert**

Love Roger's ability to capture small perfect moments. And he's intelligent without pretension. I'll finish this one quickly I think.

**Six Rivers, by Peter Coates**

Super interesting history of six influential rivers around the world. It's slow reading, and designed to tell stories that are river-centric rather than anthropocentric, giving the river agency, that kinda thing. It's interesting stuff. I like filling in my ecological knowledge like this, and I've always liked bodies of water. 




 I'd love to see a compilation of expert picks going into the 08 tournament and compare how often those 1 seeds were picked to go to the Final Four compared to the aggregate from other years, but I'm not sure such a database exists. 




 Yeah, that's why it's not as much of a knife in the resum to me haha. That's exactly what I'm saying. 




 Yes for Utah, I'd say for Arkansas it's probably got more to do with no one is getting penalized for losing at Rupp at this point. 




 VCU's still good though, Dayton's just underrated right now. Archie Miller is doing a hell of a job. Wouldn't be surprised at all to see them in the second weekend if they get the right matchups.

Anyway. Teams with multiple bigs of a caliber that could give Okafor problems are few and far between, and most of them are on this list of 7 haha. 




 I get that, I've followed college hoops since I was a kid. But I've never looked at the top group of teams and felt like they were as separate from the pack as they are this year.

That being said, it's a single-elimination tournament played by 18-22 year olds. Anything can happen 




 The upside is there. Just not convinced, personally. Better shot than my alma mater! 




 Gotcha, better than a lot of people dismissing em out of hand!

Hard to judge the Waves against Gonzaga because they just don't have the size to matchup effectively. They got killed in both matchups by Wiltjer (6'10") and Sabonis (6'10"). And those losses were by a combined 10 points.

I don't wanna say they're excusable losses for BYU, just that Pepperdine is a lot better than most sub-100 teams. 




 Thing is, Duke also plays at a fast tempo and is used to riding their horses for heavy minutes at that pace. West Virginia and VCU don't score enough to keep up with Duke unless they shoot the lights out of the ball, which is always the great equalizer of the NCAA Tournament (see: Norfolk State-Mizzou. God that game still blows my mind)

If Duke loses to someone outside this group, it's gonna be because they just didn't play defense. All of their losses are that way. 




 The thing about these teams is that it wouldn't surprise me at all if all 7 of them made the Elite 8. There are no real matchup nightmares for any of these teams outside this group, because they're all damn good teams.

I guess I'd say Arizona doesn't want to face another low-tempo team who's big enough to match up with them but also efficient on offense. Both the MVC teams come to mind. 




 That's a fair enough point haha. It's also probably unfair to assume that if you were in the Final Four you guys would still look like you have lately.  




 Say what you want about him, the man makes a great drinking game if he's calling a matchup you don't care (that much) about.

1. Take a drink every time he disagrees with a call.
2. Take 2 drinks every time he says something is "ridiculous".
3. Take 3 drinks every time he brings up the NCAA.
4. Finish your drink every time he proposes a rule change.


Seriously though I like Bilas for the reasons that have been laid out here already. The man knows hoops and is refreshingly free from a lot of the media narratives about teams. Don't always agree with him, but always want to hear what he has to say. 




 Pepperdine is underrated. Definitely not there yet, but the building blocks are there. Have you actually seen them play? 




 I hate the Seattle pod in the East. Northern Iowa and Butler, two smaller schools who could legitimately make a regional final if things broke the right way? And two of the more dangerous mid-major teams in the country in Valpo and Murray State?

FUCK YOU SAME POD.

Seriously all 4 of those teams could win a game in the tournament, if not two or three. I know it's all done on bracketing principles but I'd be so bummed if that was a real pod in two weeks. 




 Except you wouldn't be the favorite on Monday. You'd be the team people were surprised was there. 




 Wofford yes. Baylor is playing great basketball right now, and really have flown under the radar all year. Pretty much the only reason people look at them like an upset candidate is Scott Drew, which is lazy thinking. He's been proving he's not a joke for awhile now.

 Kind of an aside, but the Rays are building our old bullpen out in Tampa haha. Jepsen is obviously out there, but they signed Frieri and Kohn too.

Obviously now that Zobrist is in Oakland they look a lot better though, which is frustratingly predictable. 




 Honestly Chuck feels lazy now. It's kind of sad. Tried reading Damned and it just didn't do shit for me. 




 Only thing about Goodreads is that Amazon bought it not too long ago, and the recommendations are now generated off of that platform. So you'll get basically what Amazon thinks you'll like. Other than that, Goodreads is good stuff. 




 Cowart has been done for a while now in the eyes of the organization. Kubitza had a .405 OBP at AA last year too. And that's with a high strikeout rate apparently. This is the guy we're looking at as our 2016 3B. 




 Either that or Narcissus and Goldmund
