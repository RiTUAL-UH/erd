 "because I didn't hear anyone saying any of these in this video? Please, quote me where people have said this." 
I'm sorry but at what point did we relegate this only to the video, you brought up sjw's on tumblr, i assumed we are referencing all instances  including campaigns and instances outside of the video?

"o... do you think that coercion does not count as sexual assault? Because if so, holy shit."

the practice of persuading someone to do something by using force or threats.
"it wasn't slavery because no coercion was used" welp i really used the wrong word in this context, i apologize, i was thinking of persuasion not coercion. It is shown in my original post that the definition i used for coercion does not correlate to how coercion is defined, but yes coercion would be under every definition rape, i agree with this, but persuading your partner to have sex no i do not believe so. 

"Falsely reporting a crime is already a crime. Does falsely reporting rape need to be an extra super special crime? You don't see why this might make people afraid to actually report rapes out of fear that they'll be unfairly accused?"

No it's not, what are you talking about? falsely filing a police report is a crime, falsely reporting a rape even if it is later found not to be true is not remotely criminalized, if you retract your claims they wont charge, if you file a police report, go to court and he is found guilty and later own you retract your statement he will be freed but you still will not get charged, their are actual instances of this occuring, like the highschool football player falsely accused and who went to jail for ten years, while his accuser ended up suing the school district and won, she does not have to repay, the court system has never even attempted to go after her, she got 5 million dollars from the state in tax payers dollars and wasted another couple of thousand by having the state incarcerate an innocent man. 

Wow if you think that false accusations of rapes are actually prosecuted you're extremely delusional. Rape culture, the only culture where men can be accused of rape and immediately have their life ruined yet women still think society is unfairly victimizing rape victims, i think rape is the only crime where a person does not need to provide evidence, testify or show any facts concerning the crime yet somehow their is a high chance the accused will be sent to prison. 

 




 I love this, lets ignore the statement and then ask who is saying this, if i have never heard of it, your point is invalid. Seriously you never heard of the yes does not mean yes campaign? seriously i have a friend in the uk, feminist was telling me rape laws were not inclusive and they need to add more definitions like how being coerced into sex(if your partner badgers you but you don't feel like it, his continued persistence even if you're reluctant) should be considered a form of sexual assault, how regret should be considered valid.

In false accusations should be punished extensively, you can't declare rape is a serious crime and then allow the false reporting of rape to continue, you're making a mockery of rape, you're basically saying rape is the worse crime a woman can endure but it's perfectly fine if another woman lies about rape and deliberately hurting how actual rapes will be treated in the future, has no one ever read a boy cried wolf, same concept applies.

 




 So they did a recent study a few months back, most male on male relations are consensual not forced.  




 But that makes little sense, you're saying that rape culture is based off of men feeling entitled to women's bodies but in reality is the opposite of this, while there are the dbags who think they're Adonises and can get any woman they want, most guys have to work towards just being liked by the average woman, that's why men who can repeatedly have sex with women are seen as an example of something to emulate and admire.

The pickup artist crowd, the guys like the dude who shot up that school because women did not pay attention to him, those are the jerks who believe they're entitled to women by right of being a man, but you can go up to any guy, say wanna have sex and they will feel like they won the lottery and are at that moment king of the world.

 




 Call bullshit, the new world made Spain the most envied nation in Europe, everybody wanted a piece of that pie.  




 Proxy implies we were fighting on behalf of another power, ie France or Spain, both allies in the revolution, which is not factual, in fact France wanted and believed it would gain territory after the war ended(been awhile since I looked this up) but we kind of screwed them over when we made peace with general Cornwallis.  




 Why would Tunisia care? Hannibal barca was Carthaginian which were a Phoenician people, Phoenicia was in modern day Lebanon where their descendants(estimated to be around 20% of the population) reside, their closet relatives would be the Hebrews(ancient Hebrew/Phoenician languages were mutually intelligible, the kingdom of Israel and Phoenicia formed a trading empire together, both were conquered by Assyria and their is speculation that Hebrew writing script derives from Phoenician) so in reality Lebanon and possibly Israel?

Would be the ones not amused. 




 They already do dbag, this guys is more humanized then you treat the israeli's? what about the decades the israeli's have suffered, the lynched soldiers in ramallah? the jews beat and killed for being jews? the israeli's are not the dehumanizing aspects.  




 Yeah i know but i thought it added to the overall title it's more of a play on the struggle is real meme. 




 Palestinian hamas leader khaled meshaal is currently suffering from the trauma,exhaustion and pressure of being the leader of an oppressed, besieged people during the recent war of israeli zionist occupation and aggression. Here he is currently sitting in a gym in nice part of Qatar as another ceasefire was horribly broken by Israel after the brave and glorious  martyr's of the Palestinian captured an Israeli soldier for the first time since this conflict began. 32 Palestinian people have been killed so far in this recent flare up. Please spread this, pray for the innocent gazans and this horribly oppressed leader. The world can not stay blind to the oppressed people of Palestine and their elected officials. LOOK AT THAT BELLY THE MAN IS STARVING! 









 The last time israel allowed in constructions material was about a year ago, they used it to build a terror tunnel into israel. These are the same people who used piping and waste to build rockets.  




 I'm talking about the second intifida.  




 Listen my bad. I get what you're saying the narrative of a freedom fighter is someone else's terrorist is a great point. Even in america after they won the war of independence which we in the us consider the great american revolution many slaves who would of been granted freedom 40 years earlier then they did under if not right after the war had Britain won i'm sure probably consider the american patriots terrorist. Hell the op himself considers the political establishment a problem but believes the military wing are freedom fighters. I can cite the fact they deliberately target kids but he will consider them always to be patriots for their national cause. 

I get that. I understand. I'm just saying from my perspective on why i do not even looking from a Palestinian narrative could consider them either political or paramilitary wise freedom fighters. But that's just my  opinion. In no i'm not an Israeli, i'm an american from chicago southside. Don't want to go into details but lets just say, my mom would of slapped me had i not voted for obama in 2012 lolz. Honestly if i was an israeli... ok not going to say it might just come of as propaganda or biased but if you want look up the israeli left side of the conflict. It seems the jews by and large are more pro-pali then pro-israel so eh. But anyway have a nice day.   




 Bro you need to read the context of my post before spouting off. You clearly posted a point about kids writing their names on missiles then inferred they would be targeted at kids like them, which is not the case. Those missiles are not being targeted for children but Hamas(in the kids who die are not intentional, not even the most biased news sources state such things, unless you live in switzerland or something more then likely you know what collateral deaths are don't try to act like everything that occurs in war is completely intentional), while i may not agree with the idea of pride in your national military forces or patriotism it's entirely common for kids to be taught as such. Them signing their names is nothing different then us pilots marking jet fighters with naked women or writing slogans on their tanks, yes the inner leftist in me thinks why would you be proud of a weapon of war but we know how morale goes in any conflict. Anyway you generalized both sides hate each other, i was trying to show you by the humanitarian rights orgs(many of which are anti-israel government) such as btselem is that's not the actual case.

If i wanted to be a propagandist instead i would post vids from the idf youtube channel showing them sending food to gaza and the great humanitarian programs israel has, telling you about the stories of hamas pm grand daughter being allowed into israel for medical treatment instead i made a simple point about the conflict not being black and white. 

Secondly i never claimed they did not exist. As we understand now the Palestinian Arab people do exist, rather or not this is historically factual matters little. More then 7 million people believe they're Palestinians so they're Palestinians. In the historical context though and the origins of the national identity is what i was referring to. Secondly i never claimed any such thing jesus read my reddits correctly.

"Hamas never called ahead before sending a terrorist (not a fucking freedom fighter)
Seriously dude, it depends on perspective who is a terrorist or a freedom fighter. You are only seeing it from your perspective, try to see from other perspectives.

Ok lets look at this from the arab perspective. I'm a lesbian secular christian Palestinian arab, hamas is a radical islamist organization made up of mostly males between 20-60 with their leadership effectively 40-60 year old conservative religious males. Now please explain to me as a lesbian female living under a radical islamist government, how are they fighting for my freedom to be a lesbian and secular let alone my rights as a woman?"


I was making a point about rather or not hamas can be considered freedom fighters and if so who's freedom are they fighting for. To sunni's in iraq the isil caliphate could be considered freedom fighters but to their fellow shia they're barbaric terorrist whereas to some sunni these guys are nothing but pure thugs etc. Please understand context.

No need to insult me friend. BTW if i was a propogandist i would not put "zion" in my name. That kind of gives me away as a mossad israeli puppet who is trying to promote propoganda:)

 




 Explain to me one good thing they have accomplished then in concerns to the freedom of the Palestinian people? in your point makes no since, how are they fighting for my freedom if i am a Palestinian and apart of these people. How are they representing me? any body can say they fight for the people hell china's army is called the People's liberation army does not mean people in tibet feel liberated. Yeah but here's the difference, even  the worst extremist in israel like lets irgun/lehi who's members like begin later became israel's pms.

Begin for instance was an extremist going by a narrative he could be considered a heroic freedom fighter or a terrorist. But his actions deliberately attributed to the modern israeli state, a state in which he as pm ended the between israel,egypt and jordan. A state where now arabs can live in a secular democracy albeit they're still problems but this state does have equality. If hamas is to be called freedom fighters whose freedom are they for?  




 Wait i can get paid? for being pro israel? really now? how much? are you offering? unlike you moron i'm pro-palestine/pro-israel zionist from chicago. I'm on here because i believe in peace but you seem to be biased all around and promote a agenda. How much does pallywood pay you?  









 http://www.btselem.org/
Bullshit they're hundreds of israeli ngo's name one arab ngo that supports or has sympathy for the israeli's in then you can tell me they both hate each other. Ever heard of chomsky,feinstein?mondoweiss? why are jews the main ones calling for peace and yet the arabs call for deaths of jews?

Look at this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_Peace_massacre
The perpetrator was Jordanian Army Corporal Ahmed Daqamseh, who stated that he attacked because he was insulted and angered that the girls were whistling and clapping while he was praying.[12][1]

Speaking on Al Jazeera in May 2001, Daqamseh's mother said, "I am proud of my son, and I hold my head high. My son did a heroic deed and has pleased Allah and his own conscience. My son lifts my head and the head of the entire Arab and Islamic nation. I am proud of any Muslim who does what Ahmad did. I hope that I am not saying something wrong. When my son went to prison, they asked him: 'Ahmad, do you regret it?' He answered: 'I have no regrets.' He treated everyone to coffee, honored all the other prisoners, and said: The only thing that I am angry about is the gun, which did not work properly. Otherwise I would have killed all of the passengers on the bus.  




 http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-25518813 

Russians are saying. He died of aids ha just kidding but poison is proven to be false. Died of old age. Don't trust wiki it's heavily biased.  




 Bullshit op. Before the infitida you could travel to the west bank you fucked up by supporting hamas. 

 




 This no offense to the op but obviously skewed info. The Sabra and Shatila massacre was the slaughter of between 762 and 3,500 civilians, mostly Palestinians and Lebanese Shiites, by the Kataeb Party, a Lebanese Christian militia, in the Sabra neighborhood and the adjacent Shatila refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon from approximately 6:00 pm 16 September to 8:00 am 18 September 1982.

It was christian phalangist not sharon. Op please don't be biased. In he is a refugee due to the refusal of lebanon to make him a citizen.

In there were weapons next to the kid.  




 Because this aid ship was not really an aid ship but basically a militant organization, the commandos were armed with paintball guns and got horribly ambushed and beat by these "activist" don't believe the media hype it's all lies. 

Anyway israel allowed gaza in tons of concrete and they built a terror tunnel. Now they're allowing it in. http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/10/14/israel-blocks-construction-materials-from-gaza-after-terror-tunnel-discovery/
http://www.jta.org/2014/01/26/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/israel-to-allow-more-construction-material-into-gaza
 




 This is even worse. It ignores the simple fact even when it was not a jewish state you had conflict, go back to the nebu musa riots of the 1920's and the hebron massacre. Israel has 1.2 million israeli arabs, many of these people are sitting on the knesset like haneen zoabi yet she campaigns for the destructing of israel never mind she is only allowed to speak due to the jewish democracy. An arab majority state(not being racist) would be crap, not only for the arabs but for the jews also.

They would immediately vote on a constitution based somewhat on islamic principles and beliefs basically sharia law. The democracy would be a majority democracy, which is inherently flawed. Look at rome, look at how dictators like Caesar and before him sulla. They used the mob to their advantage to cause chaos and control the senate. Later own in america our forefathers realizing this decided against a democracy in favor of a republic. 

Allowing the arabs to control israel would not only effectively end israel it would end the jewish homeland ideals, the main point of israel is to be a jewish state free of persecution of jews and centuries of anti-semitism. This state would probably end up being a theocracy like iran or end up a corrupt nation under a dictatorship like syria or egypt. Secondly israel agreed to the partition plan(it was not offered by the arabs but the un) which would be multi-ethnic. The arabs refused.  




 Sorry but that does not add up to facts. The arabs decimated their own greenhouses and economic prosprity, then they later beg the jews to help them run the new green houses. The arabs always get second chances and they f up.

 Also the video has been edited heavily, 20 minute prior call and 15 minute from the warning missile to the actual strike look at the smoke in the window at around the 1:35 mark it suddenly dissapears. The footage is propoganda.

Um no allot of anti-semitism exist from the pro palestine crowd. In they don't mean the jews. http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-09-13/palestinian-israeli-jews-future-state-israel-PLO/50394882/1

Especially in the west this jew hatred continues by arab immigrants.  




 The rest was owned by the british,turks or absentee arab land owners. If your grand dad has a certificate, talk to an israeli ngo, bring it to the supreme court, it's chaired by a israeli arab(i believe a muslim or druze). If it's valid you can move back. This is what 90% of arabs like to ignore, israel has a proper justice system, the israeli's also keep plots of land open for arab land owners in jerusalem or parts of israel i believe. At worse you may need to simply accept compensation. 




 It's really complicated, they don't wanna give Palestinians passport cause they want them to go back to their country. Palestinians in Lebanon don't even have the right to own anything or even work in public fields... You can read more about this online.. its really terrible.."

Scroll up this is from another palestenian user from lebanon, lebanon refues them citizenship, career access and other basics that could help improve their situation so that they can continuously be used as a way to keep international opinion against israel at the same time keep their populaces distracted from what they do that's usually even worse. Look it up.  




 This is  the part where gazan bias comes in. Israel never stole your water. Israel is the reason the region has water. The gas they speculated and found is there gas. You can have tourist from the egyptian side but they refuse to open the border. Israel stole your sand? seriously 0-0


Because the coastal plain of Judea samaria had few water resources, Theodor Herzl already envisioned the transfer of water from the Jordan River to the coast for irrigation and drinking water supply. In order to realize that Zionist vision, the water company Mekorot was created in 1937, more than a decade before the creation of the state of Israel. In the first two decades of Israel's existence, substantial financial resources were dedicated to create the National Water Carrier, a complex water supply system including the Shiloach Pipeline along the Burma Road to Jerusalem built during the 1948 ArabIsraeli War, a first pipeline to the Negev in 1955 and the transfer of water from the Sea of Galilee in 1964. Furthermore Mekorot began a Rain Enhancement program in 1961, increasing rainfall by 13%-18%. Also, a Brackish Water Pipeline was completed in 1965 to divert brackish ground water from infiltrating the Sea of Galilee.

Water reclamation (1970s and 80s)[edit]


Drinking water being collected by hand in Neot Mordechai c. 1947
In 1969 the Shafdan wastewater treatment plant south of Tel Aviv was completed to treat approximately 130 million cubic meters of wastewater per year for reuse in agriculture. However, wastewater from other cities and towns remained largely untreated. In 1970 there was a cholera outbreak because of illegal irrigation of salad with untreated wastewater. This gave rise to major investments in wastewater treatment under the National Sewerage Plan, which emphasized the reuse of treated wastewater. In 1984 the Kishon wastewater treatment plant was completed in Northern Israel, It provides 20 million cubic meters of treated wastewater per year for agricultural use in the fertile Jezreel Valley, maximizing distribution potential during high-demand periods.

Signing of water sharing agreements (1990s)[edit]
The 1995 Interim Agreement as part of the Oslo Peace Process provided certain quantities of water to the Palestinians, but prevents them from drilling any new wells in the Mountain Aquifer. The surface water of the Jordan River remains disputed with Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians. Only with Jordan Israel was able to reach an agreement on the sharing of water resources in 1995 as part of the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty. 

Israel provided the water in the first place. A full decade before the creation of israel. No offense but you guys refused oslo and israel still gives you their water.

 This is ignorant af. First off the jews never came to anyone's land and told them to go. The original zionist bought the land from absentee turkish/arab land owners, the majority of the land outside of that belonged to the british authority. Even know arabs still sell land and are prosecuted(even killed) for doing it. The average arab "land" owners living in the land was irreverently small to be a joke. Actually yes. Arabs like haj amin husseini recruited for the waffen ss gathering bosnian muslimss divisions, the ss were the main jew hunters in eastern europe. He was so successful by the end of ww2 it was 60% non german.  




 Ok lets look at this from the arab perspective. I'm a lesbian secular christian Palestinian arab, hamas is a radical islamist organization made up of mostly males between 20-60 with their leadership effectively 40-60 year old conservative religious males. Now please explain to me as a lesbian female living under a radical islamist government, how are they fighting for my freedom to be a lesbian and secular let alone my rights as a woman?          




 Um how do you stop a bomb that's already in place and a previous attack was actually stopped by the jewish authority. The brits who had a military HQ there refused to evacuate.  




 Falafel, hummus, and shwarma aren't Palestinian culture. 

 *filfal, from Aramaic pilpl, "small round thing, peppercorn," derived from palpl, "to be round, roll". Thus in origin, falafel would be "rollers, little balls." 

Besides it dates to middle-eastern jews and egyptians.  




 This is incorrect. The jewish peple settled in the land in the 1800's under theodr herzl. Groups of arabic nomads and bedouin were the only people left in the region until more arabs showed up with the return of the jews, not being racist but yes the arabs believed that if the jews returned that the land would prosper and they could get paid by working for them. It's culturally ingrained by people to believe jews have money and can turn anything into a paradise. Which they did... 

Anyway these people living in the mandate of palestine eventually by the british came to be known as palestenians, the only people who identified as this however were jews. The arabs got offended and declared themselves southern syrians. In 48 after 2 decades starting in 1921 with the neba musa riots(jerusalem) in which a man by the name of haj amin husseini tried to eradicate the jewish immigrants living in the land. Shit got cray cray, the jews set up defense forces like haganah, the arabs kept trying to exterminate the jews like during the 1929 palestine riots, the jaffa and hebron riots etc till the point where the jews got tired of there shit in started their own paramilitaries since the british(who controlled the mandate) refused to protect the jews. Something about antisemitism being an ingrained right of people. So the jews developed orgs like stern gang,irgun and lehi. Jewish extremist groups. These groups then basically went on an all out back and forth tug of war between the jews,arabs and the british forces. The arabs killed jews, the jews killed arabs in return, the brits stepped in, got both arabs and jews killed or ignored it, in turn the jews/arabs killed the brits. 

The mainstream zionist authority tried to keep the paramilitaries at bay and calm, which never worked out, they cooperated and helped the british authority. Eventually the brits after getting tired and ww2 coming and going. Decided to let the newly formed un handle this "palestine" situation. The un mandated a partition plan where the jews would get 45% of the land, this land would be about 40% percent jewish and 50% arab. This was in the negev mostly and along the coast. Arabs would get 55% along with some 15,000 jews. With jerusalem now officially being a un mandate governed city. The jews agreed thankful to get this and arabs said hell no. They launched a war and lost to the jewish forces holding their ground. For 20 years jordan/egypt occupied the land allocated for the arabs, after israel retook this territory, the plo formed by egyptian born arafat. They took the name the jews discarded when they founded the jewish state of israel and began a war against the jewish statehood. Since that point we have a palestine national caused based on a political ploy nothing more nothing less.


Way back on March 31, 1977, the Dutch newspaper Trouw published an interview with Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee member Zahir Muhsein. Here's what he said:

The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism. 




 Simply put. Their not claiming your "land" they're claiming the ancestral home of the jewish people. As exemplified by the numerous jewish artifacts,holy sites,cultural sites and historical evidence that points to it being a Jewish state. The country of israel was founded not by religious orthodox jews, ben gurion, theodr herzl and the rest were all atheist/secular jewry. Biblically speaking the most religious jews are anti-israel believing only the messiah can create a jewish statehood, which is why whenever you see an orthodox jew at a pro-palestine rally they're usually the radical guys who don't have a problem chilling next to the former iranian president who host holocaust denial events. They're also the reason why you hear about little girls being spit on and women told to sit on at the back of the bus. They're firmly anti-zionist.
Zionism is exclusively about giving the jewish people a homeland to free them from centuries of antisemitism. 

Hell golda meir the first female pm of israel had this to say in concerns to moses.

"Let me tell you something that we Israelis have against Moses. He took us 40 years through the desert in order to bring us to the one spot in the Middle East that has no oil"
