 Massaged my anus and came the build up felt a bit good but the ejaculation was like a annoying irritating feeling, i felt dizzy and felt like vomiting afterwards, light headed and felt sick. I am circumcised, does this have to do with anything? I have dried up glands as do all circumcised guys and it's the dorsal slit method so manual restoration is not an option

 Is pleasure affected? 




 My day will basically consist of important things cold turkey and deep contemplative thought 




 What do you guys think? 














 dopamine receptor and neuroplasticity conversation

You: i tried to develop a strategy

You: neurons are strengthened better if pleasure pain or emotions are 
involved


You: right?

You: so what i figured was, what if i stop all the stimulation

You: and let myself get bored

You: no tv shows

You: no junk food

You: no slouching sitting up straight

You: no procrastinating focusing

You: and i stuck to it

You: it ended badly

You: i got depressed

You: anxious

You: but when i did stimulate myself

You: via "fun"

You: i felt better

You: but i feel like having too much fun is bad

You: as it can be a distraction

You: and can make one dependent on "fun"

You: it can make them addicted as well

You: which will be harder to quit

i guess some sort of balance is the key? your thoughts? 




 After fully understanding nietzsche i have discovered just how flawed the society around me and myself are. I found all my delusions, rationalisations, false interests, escapism all of it and it does feel terrible but I am willing to improve myself bit by bit. When exposing the overwhelming amount of flaws my mind kept on switching between giving up with a sense of nihilism (it's all going to end anyway so just live life and let it go) to the will to life and the will to power (Life happens once, be completely honest in every moment) the eternal recurrence started spawning ideas in my head, If I were to repeat this life with the lack of meaning and delusions for eternity how unfulfilling would it be? Though if there were times when I stood up and acted against delusions and become brave and powerful, then a repeating life may be worth it just for the moments of greatness. Where to begin though? When my mind is solving a problem I just ask myself, is this the most important thing I could be thinking about right now? am I spending my days truly improving my life or am I just wasting it because of escapism and more delusions? Is the question "Am i doing/thinking the most important thing in my life?" a question worth asking, is it an important question? what if it is a result of a delusion? There are so many variables that my whole life is making me feel lost and powerless but the will to life still remains

 "I should wait until I am on day 10 to apply for jobs, to see my friends, to go out, to work on projects, because on day 10 i am in super power mode"

Days pass then i relapse and feel guilty, the cycle continues, how can I get out of this mode of thinking, I even remind myself of what day I am on rather than using the counter as a way to measure progress I rely on it, help 




 My friend Shin Dong-hyuk escaped from a north korean concentration camp and from our conversations and all of our interactions I can tell how profound his situation was, it's beyond imagination. 









 are you feeling it now mr crabs?

 "Addiction is somewhat like peer pressureit hovers around, urging you to do something, but the decision to take action is yours. When people say that they cant give up an addiction, it usually means that deep down they dont want to or dont believe that its possible." PHD study
Nothing is true everything is permitted carpe diem etc 









 I figured neuroscience is the most important thing i can learn about right now, what's the most efficient way of learning neuroscience, wikipedia? youtube? 




 why, it was a massive load though 




 can you elaborate on how you did this? 




 *Also, I started doing things that make me feel uncomfortable or scare and intimidate me. It really expanded....my mind, I guess.

can you elaborate on this part? 









 What are major things that have improved your life and are worth putting time into?

I was thinking of learning more about neuroscience and reading nietzsche 




 That's a justification? 




 18 starting zoloft for depression, anxiety and attention issues
edit: heard people can have permanent brain chemical issues
development issues
high amount of weight gains 




 exactly 




 what's the point though? isn't life itself worth the experience, no matter how much pain and suffering, the will to life, what justification would you have not to live your life 




 what's the point? it seems like an excuse for any weaknesses, a way to avoid the will to live 




 I like the cycle of dissapointment, self improvement, challenges and learning but have you ever had times or are you planning to have times when they will be the most joyful, where you are madly in love or doing something that makes you fall in love with life itself, like these two seem to be experiencing things on a whole new level http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2W0-z8EnaM 




 what's the point of that? The will to life makes much more sense 




 Love, experiences, learning, challenges, self improvement.

I am trying to find something to do with my life, maybe get a job maybe try to find love what is a worthy challenge 



















 Not this time, we are strong 




 (Y) 




 We all know it, one day we will die and then we won't exist forever.


Right now as your eyes read the words I am typing, you exist and if you are honest enough with yourself, the journey to self improvement is the best journey.

**This right here is an opportunity to walk through the desert to see how successful you are at survival in the desert. To test your spirit against the ultimate challenge: owning one's self. How long until your spirit breaks? Probably not long but instil the idea of death properly in your mind, non existence forever is the most powerful source of energy to make the hard decisions in the present moment. Stay powerful and be cautious of emotions, self pity and other forms of weakness. Finally the most important way to travel in this journey is to "pour the water on the ground" as someone else on this forum once said. The water is tempting to drink in the desert but once you realise beyond the self doubt that you are powerful enough to pour the water and continue walking through the desert then you will be on your way to sure success. When you arrive in a situation where you are tempted to just fap or just watch one more video or any types of distractions, you should identify that they are glasses of water that you should pour on the ground and keep fighting in the desert.** 




 Swinging so mundanely from a metal garage door support, with her gorgeous neck twisted like an animal's with a $3 Home Depot extension cord. And you're going to tell me there's a fucking God? Fuck you.

Love is something that human's hold very close to each other 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dDRijXGUNc
there is life after love as the saying goes, if you have come this far maybe you are willing to take a few more steps 














 I disagree strongly and it's obvious why. 




 Yes, because seeing things in context, the "big picture", is one of the most difficult intellectual challenges. Most lifeforms can't do it. It is our human gift to be able to juxtapose in the mind things that aren't juxtaposed in our environment. Especially intangible things like your own death. Imagining death as a thing and then placing that thing next to other things in the mind is hard work. Keep practicing.

That feeling where something you have been trying to do is placed into words and you finally feel that the meaning of such a task has been increased because someone else commented it 




 while you are alive you have to be brutally honest with yourself

 do that 




 finished highschool 




 i alternate per day i lift weights then on the even day and on the odd day I run until i'll out of breath takes 5-10 minutes 









 I feel like I lose my super powers after all types of ejaculation though, even with a partner. 




 bump 




 The few days after a relapse, I feel absolutely terrible and i'm not sure why.

Either it's because I have "lost" super powers.

Because I feel guilty or because my belief in no fap is so strong that it's actually having a placebo on me

Brain chemicals or hormones

someone please help, or knock some perspective into me 














 private message me and we can be no fap accountability buddies in a group chat 




 I'm usually intellectpassion and emotion but... LET'S DO THIS SHIT 




 exactly, rather than saying yes to nofap you are saying yes to life 









 can you elaborate on the difficulty though, how long and how many attempts 




 Testing out a recent study, type of you are cut or uncut, and how your progress with this has been going/longest streaks etc. 




 your link isn't working, what do you mean by "elaborated" in this context 




 that's what i said 




 bump 




 circumcised guys are more prone to relapsing,
uncircumcised guys can last long streaks of 90 days+ etc
is it true? tell me if you are cut or uncut and how your streaks have been going
there are theories on this that I will explain after I get the replies 




 don't get it 




 The last part reminded me of something in my childhood, i can't quite tell what it is, make me wonder if I have memories that are "blocked" out or if I am living a life that denies one aspect as if I am in denial then again it could be that i'm imagining things, makes you wonder... 




 Yes, my family hid 25 grand in a small room instalment behind the house, I was contemplating faking a break in and taking the money.
Someone give me some perspective or advice?
Not sure how insurance works but insurance companies might not believe they hid money there. 









 In my case i think i am very sexual and when the drive comes back i just can't let go. i PMOD, 

1. felt bored and was getting image like flashes of a girl from my school

2. Started to imagine her in the room getting naked wanted to have sex

3. imagined some of the ex

4. instead of studying i disabled my filters my google chrome extensions so i could google stuff about sex stories, i felt very curious to read about what sex feels like in detail

5. felt the urge to watch a girl getting satisfied vaginally it was like OCD something is seriously wrong here

6. watched porn videos of girls getting satisfied vaginally from the front (this satisfied that ocd like urge)

7. erection with a lot of precum, felt like orgasming but i had a strong urge to also stop it all and go to sleep

8. *you've already come this far close to orgasm + porn might as well orgasm*
that statement always leads me to failure, i don't know if there is some truth to it

9. came

URGENT HELP BROZ 




 How many times did you relapse, i've relapsed around a dozen times 




 though what if a consciously focus on what i am doing to the point where i don't notice the noise, idk this situation is very confusing for me, there is time pressure as well and i feel so scared and lost, all these opinions from others "only a day until your exam!" "wow that noise is really bad how can you study" idk whether to believe or what so lost omg fuck 




  If you have music from your neighbors that is fairly loud, would you suggest staying where the noise is and studying so that I can get used to studying with noise, or moving all my stuff which is a hastle

 




 that's irrelevant to my question, it's a matter of me getting used to noise or if nose is not something you can get used to for intense concentration like exams and studying

 smacked? docked? 




 I would also like to add to the example of a forest with an overall improvement in enjoyment and quality of life/happiness/satisfaction
also the nofap forum would be an example of those abstaining from (pmo) porn masturbation and orgasm which includes other forms of stimulation 









 It's hard to measure if one is truly happy though, I can go ahead and believe that I am in the best state I can possibly be but every day there is some frustration to an extent mixed in with despair and it seems to part of an individual's progress. 




 @takei what's happening 




 a fulfilling relationship
or fulfilling aspects in their lives, elaborate on these  points 









 wtf is this shit feel achy, anxious, sick in my stomach, hopeless, depressed, apathetic

throughout these 8 days i have held on to my D, provoked some erections for the feeling of horniness, and sexual fantasy has been on my mind non stop 









 have you realised that you could zoom out and see life for every second as very valuable as this is the only existence you could get, you could be spending your time doing what is really the most important, the neurons that lead you to choose something more comfortable can be replaced by neurons that want you to make the most out of life, every second is the most valuable you will ever receive in all of existence
