 Shame and thanks for the confirmation. Ill just have to back up a bunch of the music, even the ones I have not fully decided whether I "like" them currently or not. 




 What happened with Ozzwald and his/her youtube channel and all the associated music/remixes they made? I could not find any information other than that they are all gone.

Its a real shame at least to me because I really appreciated their Gypsy Bard remix but all I can find is a speedycake and one poor quality upload such as this. http://youtu.be/v4rNysM51kA 

sidenote: I have his original song still and I was trying to tag it with a link to his youtube upload.
