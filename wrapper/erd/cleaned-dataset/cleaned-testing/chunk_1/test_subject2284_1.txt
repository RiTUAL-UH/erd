 well I'm sure you'll be very pleased at this ending then. 




 Unfortunately this really isn't a subjective thing, people can and will validly flag you for this. Nudity is a valid reason for a copyright strike, just the same as putting up licensed music unedited. Youtube doesn't give a damn about quality of content or power of creators, they just want the PR of saying 'your kiddywinkles won't see no boobs!" 




 Yeah, essentially any nudity shown for erotic purposes isn't allowed on youtube, this need to be fixed quickly sips. 




 If you tell him not to cheat, Simon will skin you and wear your head as a hat. 




 Oh God, I had this and the TPP reddit open in different tabs. THE WORLDS ARE MERGING! 




 That's what I tell myself about robocop 3, it was all just a dream wasn't it? 




 SHADOW OF ISRAPHEL CONFIRMED! TOMORROW AT 6! BE THERE OR BE SQUARE SUCKAS! I for one will be starving myself, waiting tfor the glory that is SOI to nourish me. 




 "SPAM IT! SPAM IT DUNCAN!"

 That's nothing compared to toady one, lone creator of Dwarf fortress. He's been making the worlds most realistic simulation game non-stop for 5 years now, and plans to work for another 15 




 Weirdest dream? Well it started out with me riding on the shoulder of a giant robot (It kinda looked like Gypsy danger from pacific rim,)  made out of bears,(And I don't mean teddy bears, I mean hyper realistic bears and all the bears were talking to me, with the voice of Nintendo characters, bears were talking to me with mario and princess peaches voice, saying things like 'how was your day, what are you so sad, can I have a chocolate sandwich please'

However, as the dream went on the robot made of bears started walking over a town , more specifically, Brighton, England, I had to keep ducking my head because for some reason, and I have no idea why, the people walking on the street, people I knew from school and stuff, were pulling out SNIPER RIFLES and specifically trying to shoot me. I didn't really care, as y'know, it was a weird ass dream, when I felt a really painful, dull thud in my head, in real life, I had woken up, tried to sit bolt upright (because that's what they do in movies) but had leaned too far forward and smacked my head into a wall, I went back into the dream, only this time things had changed. I was in a concentration camp, and this robot made out of bears was standing right next to me, but it was around my size (and thus composed of really tiny bears) The bears mouths were now full of blood, and against the wall of the concentration camp were all my fictional characters, everything my imagination had ever created. The Bear robot then spoke to me, with the nintendo characters, thousands of them, speaking at the same time like the voice of legion. It said "We are your new friends now, kill your old ones" (I even now think that my subconscious should have come up with better dialogue) I asked how I should kill them and it said "With an imaginary gun of course" 


And then the dream just ended, I woke up of course, and was left to look at the ceiling of my room. 




 SPOILERS! I'm actually hoping they screw up the main quest of this a couple of times, because you get sent back into Khare to travel the paths you didn't go first time around, which would provide a tonne more content. 




 Exactly, if you delve too far into these theories they eat themselves, as 'Simon and Lewis' aren't actually characters, they're avatars. Hell, if they were really tying up loose ends they would explain why Commander Riker was on an adventure with a dwarf. 




 Have you bought the DLC's? 'reefer madness' would be a cool one to see. 




 I would say that may not be the case any more, as once a twist is discovered pre-reveal(and this is fairly obviously the twist) some creators irrationally change it to keep ahead of the fandom. Some creators, not all mind you.  




 But Simon isn't necessarily going to 'roleplay' perfectly, remember from a meta perspective Yoglabs and SOI don't exist at all, it's just characters and roles. 




 That's because they're in the same genre, known as a MOBA, that was created by the original DOTA. Therefore, SMNC, Smite, LOL, and dota 2 all share ver similar mechanics. 




 I would love to see a playthrough of space marine. It's a perfect fit for Rythian 




 I've just finished playing sorcery 2. Can't wait to see them lose all there money, get thrown into sewers, try to become pirates and get turned into dogs. 




 I think you should E-mail the yogscast about this. A reddit post called 'a suggestion' isn't the best way to attract attention, but I wish you luck all the same! 




 You should have caught and trained that goblin. 




 Yeah, I'm sure Sjin will be JUST GREAT at the wonderful 101 




 Wallys loss was donut boy's gain! 




 Don't worry, I'm sure Lewis will be able to save them :3 




 Foolish Duncan! You have to hold a PIECE of space, like some moon rocks, then if you make a wish, you'll land.

It's really quite simple, It's frankly baffling the Yogscast haven't grasped it yet. 




 I may be in the minority here, but I don't think WOW is necessarily the most easily accessible or dynamic game. A lot of it revolves around mechanics that are simply arcane to a regular viewer. I would prefer to see you play another game with a similar theme, such as a single player RPG, roguelike, or non RPG MMO, it would be cool to see the yogscast develop guilds in planetside, DC universe or EVE for example. However, I would watch a WOW video if it had a podcast type format, with a raid in the background. That way, if people don't like WOW they can enjoy chatter with sips and the like, and if people do like WOW they can appreciate the stategy. 




 Hey Sips, seeing turbo Joe led to this, can this lead to Toribash, seeing as it also has stupid ragdoll physics and hyperviolence? More specifically, I think it would be cool if you tried out the popular 'duel sword' fighting online multiplayer that is popular with the kids these days. Not only would an online multiplayer game be revolutionary new content (Literally never seen before on Lets play!) but it would also be damn fun to watch you cut some poor clowns arm off. 




 Holy crap, Exalt WAS a nigerian Email scam! 




 I bet special agent Parvis is pissed. 




 But what about xcom Teep, I mean, he has those amazing hands for snipi- oh, wait, he doesn't anymore. 




 Hey, did you read my fictionalization of the CIV5 came I did? Reddit badly screwed up the paragraphing, but someone was kind enough to post a paragraphed version in the comments. You'd enjoy it. 




 It's worth noting that the old blip video player was IMO far more stable than youtube. And is still used occasionally today, I don't know many specifics, but maybe it can be set as a theme?  




 I swear, if youtube doesn't cut this crap out soon, there will be a mass migration to blip. 




 Cool, that's all I ask. Thanks for the reply! 




 But they were defending the block throughout the entire game, but this didn't count as a win condition because the attackers hadn't failed to STEAL the block. 




 I was trying to compose a comprehensive argument, as it's a game that needs some thought and reasoning applied to it, rather than 'play ac 4 pls' 




 OK, so I'm just going to say that I'm a huge fan of Dwarf fortress, and I personally think it's one of, if not the greatest roleplaying videogames ever made. I also love Rythians commentary and gameplay style; namely, cool, competent and collected, letting the games provide any humor, that's why I think Rythian should make and attempt to make a playthrough of Dwarf fortress, after he has of course learnt the game. Here are some of the Pro's and cons of doing a playthrough, for your consideration


Pros:
*Dwarf fortress lends itself extremely well to a continuation of the themes prevalent in the Xcom series, namely, the yogscast vs the world. Dwarf fortress is a game where you start with 7 dwarfs, which in the playthrough could be named after various important members of the yogscast. In game, these guys already have incredibly detailed personalities, backstories and abilities, and have to essentially build a fortress to protect themselves from the nasty, sprawling, world. This naturally lends itself to roleplay and hilarious events.


*Exclusivity. Dwarf fortress is traditionally seen as a game that doesn't lend itself to video lets play, and thus, very few lets plays have been attempted. However, at the moment, Rythian is in the exact right place to make a lets play of Dwarf fortress. His fanbase is much older than the 'main' yogscast fanbase, would be more welcoming of this style of game, and, as shown by Prison architect and towns, as well as Civ 5 to a lesser extent. Therefore, you have the perfect set of people to accommodate this game. Furthermore, the yogscast is in somewhat of a lull at the moment, with no major non MC series, Civ 5 is showing the live stream stuff and Sip's has stopped skyrim. Therefore, t's the perfect opportunity to make the next big series, something that Kid's will be talking about in playgrounds and saying "Holy shit guys, did you see the latest dwarf fortress ep where simon lost an arm and a leg? And lewis valiantlly sacrificed himself to save his friend from the Goblins? You have to watch it!"


*You're style of play naturally complements dwarf fortress. You're one of the most serious members of the yogscast, and tend to get heavily invested in the games you play. Therefore, the events of dwarf fortress will easily be able to allow you to show emotion in your lets play. For example, Elves in dwarf fortress will become deeply angered if you offer to sell them wood, sometimes even starting wars. So Rythian would be deeply shocked when elves start turning up his fortress RIDING UNICORNS and lay siege, and waste, to his fortress, even killing his hardened warrio dwarf, zoey Proasheck. Rythian swears revenge, and kills the next dwarven caravan to enter his base. When the next siege arrives, Rythian tries to set up an elaborate lava trap to kill them all, however, this backfires and ends up killing everyone. I mean, How cool would that be? And it doesn't need an elaborate script, it just needs Rythians personality and a copy of Dwarf fortress.


Cons:
*Graphics, I'm not going to deny that Dwarf fortress isnt the prettiest game in the world, or the most visually friendly to a casual viewer, however, mods like this [lazy newb pack]
(http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=126076.0)
Help to alleviate the problem by making DF simple and cleaner, with a better tileset and more utilities.


*Time and work investment, similar to the above, DF takes quite a while to learn how to play, and will require a significant time and work investment to be able to play properly, although it's not as intimidating as it initially seems. But oh, Rythian, the results are glorious


*Down time in videos. When stuff is going hilariously wrong/right in DF it's some of the most entertaining stuff in games, but when You're just managing boring things like stone stockpiles and the like, it can get kind of tedious.  see 3 ways to alleviate this:
1.Play in an evil biome, where stuff is going wrong all the time, and things are always trying to kill you
2. Edit the boring stuff out in videos, although this should be a last resort.
3. Always be working towards some grand goal, such as a 'fuck the world' magma cannon or megaproject, which will help keep the series focused.


All in all,  I definitely think the eventual Pros of this risk will longterm outweigh the Cons, and I think this will be a series people will want to see in their inbox, and look forward to at the end of a long day of work. 




 Because It's not making them 'think they're winning' It's just letting them win, deliberately putting yourself at a disadvantage for no apparent reason. Besides, they weren't whining and breaking the rules to win, they were disillusioned by the very concept of the adventure map being against them, and the fact red team is able to do all kinds of strategies, where theirs are limited to letting them take blocks, and then hopefully killing them. 




 But that's a stupid idea for a game. Defenders need to defend, they shouldn't need to think up Bond villain strategies to win a game when the other team can't actually get the iron due to their own lack of ability. 




 I'd a;also like to point out that Rythian was obviously the most experienced, and was the only player other than zylus to know what the super bar did, and the only player to know how to charge it. 




 This was a really great Tournament, It's really fun and tense to watch 1v1 yogscast videos like this. I would love to see more of divekick, and I would also suggest Toribash (Sword fight or normal, could make for some interesting fights) and Nidhogg. 




 They did for wonderful 101 




 Or a lego videogame, that could have lots of lego talk. 




 Sips, please play lego marvel Super heroes! You can play as the hulk and smash shit! you can fly about and blow stuff up as Iron man! You can swing on buildings as spiderman! Plus, it has co-op, so you can do this with your best bud Sjin! But seriously, iit would make as marvelous playthrough, with plenty of lego talk, hilarious moments and a fast pace. 




 But redshirt could be argued to be as much of a member of 'team yogscast' as teep, being an ascended extra. Zhang is just an unrelated x com character 




 Thank you so much for this, I actually really appreciate it. 




 Reddit screwed it up. It was originally formatted in word, I have done a hasty edit. 




 Ok, So I thought I would post my epilogue to the Last Civ 5 game here. I haven't done a hugely through editing Job and It was written on word, so reddit may screw things up. If that is so, please forgive me for it, please.

Lewis was kicking pebbles on the sands of the 'for sale $10' shore, his last city due to the peace treaty. That damns peace treaty! He thought to himself, cursing his rotten luck, why, why, why had he decided to start that blasted war, when he knew that damn dutch venetian alliance was unbeatable if they worked together? He supposed that was the problem really, if they had been at each others backs like he expected them to, he could have swooped in and taken world leadership for himself! He could just imagine it, sipping cocktails from his own private brewery in his tundra palace, eating the best butts from France, the crabs from the dutch, and watching that sniveling toad Rythian of cry-venitian-penissulababia grovel and beg for support. Instead, he gets this shitty, hot Island in the middle of nowhere, and this weird, grey, spongy mass at his feet rather than his beloved snow. What the hell was this stuff anyway? Aren't beaches supposed to have sand on them? He should ask sips about it, he has been on the island longer than him.

"Hey sips, what the hell is this stuff that's on the ground everywhere! Lewis hollered over to the other side of the island, which, as for sale $10 was only around 500 foot across, wasn't saying much.
"I don't go by that name anymore, use my real name"
"'sigh' please tell me the meaning of this mysterious substance, oh holy ruler of France, eater of the finest butts, the best guy, the real guy, the big bastard himself, sips"
Thank you, jeez, you'd think a little formality would be in order when addressing the true ruler of this island"
"You sold it to me for free! You didn't even sell it for 10 buck!" Lewis replied angrily, the worst thing about this was that, in some respects, sips was right, he was the equal proprietor of the Island, and, since they were both effectively immortal without the intervention of serious firepower, that was unlikely to change anytime soon. So what did you want to talk to me about, you want in on my super-duper top secret plan?!?!?!?" Lewis jumped, he still hadn't gotten used to how small the island was, and Sips' appearance was, frankly, frightening. He was entirely, naked, aside from a small reed skirt, had somehow gotten tattoos on his knuckles with fuckin' a and fuckin' b on the side, and had a chest tattoo simply stating his French national anthem:

*Big money
*Big women
*Big fun

However, by far the most disturbing aspect of his appearance was his, disgusting patchy beard. Lewis, having been bestowed with a magnificent, well-kept beard since beard since birth, was appalled by the conditions this innocent creature living on sips face had been subjected to.
Sips, please just tell me what the crap were standing on is, and maybe Ill listen to your plan Lewis was exasperated, how many days had he been stuck on this island, having to look at that beard, listening to sips ramble on about how he beat pyrion in an arm wrestle for control of China. Worse still, despite his best efforts, the state of his own beard was rapidly deteriorating, what will happen when his only remaining pride and joy had no pride, nor joy, placed into its upkeep? 
Sips looked around at his surroundings for a while, poking the grey mass with his toe. Lewis observed that it looked buoyant enough to not take in water, perhaps it was some mystical substance that the French people had invented, about to be used for a mobile battalion of Islands? Jeez, I dont know everything, guy, it was like this when I built this city, why would I sell this for $10 otherwise? Im not an idiot, Im a savvy genius that will one day rule the world, I mean super planet 3 million has been foretold by eat a butt as the successor to terra or whatever the planet is called nowadays, I mean, this may look bad for me now guy, but I have access to the most valuable resource in the world, and therefore the greatest superweapon, for sale $10 has ever seen! I mean, you didnt think I wasnt doing anything while you guys were just ignoring me did you, Im an enterprising individual!
For some inexplicable reason sips, your words dont exactly fill me with confidence
Well if youre not going to use my full title, you obviously dont have faith in me, spaceguy of the Girl Guide Corporation At those words, sips ran away, off to his end of the island, whilst Lewis again started absent-mindedly kicking pebbles, willing something, anything, to happen.
 Astonishingly, at that very thought, the sound of metal cutting through the sea was brought to his ears. A battleship! Come to rescue him and take him away from this dreadful pla- oh, It was Duncans, as identified by the hasty paintjob of a skull and crossbones on its side, as well as a plank, waiting for people to walk it. Its large speakers spread the sound of Duncan the Pirate kings voice over thousands of Mile of Sea as Lewis realized something: This wasnt his saviour, it was his tormentor.

Ahem, uh hello, I mean ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRR YA SCURVY KNAVES DONE BEEN MESSING AROUND WITH ME TREASURE HOARD, AND NOW YE PAY THE PRICE OF FAILURE 
Duncan, please, just let me talk over the intercom. Theres a reason Im world leader
NAY!!  YE BE A CONNIVING, LIMY SOD, AND SOON YE BETRAY ME JUST LIKE SJIN! IT IS JUST AS THE EAT A BUTT PROPHECY FORETOLDYE-At this point, Lewis could quite audibly hear a loud scuffle over the announcer, when it next came back, he could hear rythians, smoother, calmer demeanour over the audio. Anyway, what Duncan was meant to say was that Sjin betrayed the Shoshone/Venetian/Dutch/ Moroccan alliance, and for that he has, unfortunately, been sentenced to walk the plank. Let this be a lesson to you all, my words are backed with nuclear weapons! 
You broke your own damn alliance by kicking me out to this Island! Lewis furiously shouted back, hoping desperately that Rythian would be able to hear. Oh what was that Lewis? We betrayed you? Well tell that to the people of Prague. Prague remembers. My words are backed by nuclear weapons! Rythian was mocking Lewis, but Lewis had no leverage. It was hopeless. Sjin was on the deck now, walking slowly across the plank, and fear in his eyes. The Dutch pirates, with tiny tulips attached to their cutlasses (not even dutch, thought Lewis) were edging Sjin closer and closer to the end of the plank, whilst doing terrible impressions of Pirates. Lewis Knew he couldnt let Rythian and the worlds worst pirate king do this to Sjin, his only friend and ally, so he did the only thing he could, he picked up the Largest object he could find, a tiny pebble, and threw it directly at duncans ship making a small chink noise as it bounced harmlessly off the destroyers bow. DUNCAN, YOU ARE A TERRIBLE PIRATE KING, A TERRIBLE WORLD LEADER, AND A TERRIBLE DUTCHMANbefore long, a terrible, bellowing voice came from the bowels of the battleship. The Duncmeister obviously hadnt been allowed access to the pa system again. WHOS BEEN QUESTIONING MY AUTHORITY OVER THE GREATEST MAN THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN! CONQUERER OF BOTH LEWIS AND SJIN! DUNCAN THE  UNSTOPPABLE?
I have Duncan, and you may strike me down, but I will become stronger than you can even imagine Lewis was making stuff up as he went along, wasnt there something in eat a butt about reincarnation? Uh, Lewis, you do realize, that, theyre arent like respawns in this game, if I kill you, you die, thats it 
Yeah, get him boss! said Sjin, rather feebly; he wasnt sure who he should be a lackey for.
Im done playing these games after your INSOLENCE lewis! I mean, ARRRR, we give you dis bootiful Tropical paridise, and dis is how ye repay us? I do believe they be a double execution today boys!
Well, you may, want to rethink that strategy, Duncmeister, because I have a superweapon trained on your ship at this very moment
Ok Lewis, har har, youve had your fun, but come on we all know you dont have a superweapon Duncan had walked up to the top deck now, Flanked by Rythian, who had a tired, exasperated look that only the partners of the pirate king could know
I DO BELIEVE, I CAN ANSWER THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION said a voice lewis hadnt heard in a long time; Stepping out of the bushes, garbed in full navy uniform and a sword that seemed to be glowing with energy, was pyrion flax.  However, the most fascinating thing about Pflaxs appearance was his beard, which was extremely long and grey. So long, in fact, that It almost seemed to trail off into infinity. And thats Lewis realized to his horror, what he was standing on. He wasnt standing on an island, he was standing on pyrion flaxes beard.
Ysee Duncan, whilst you were away from me, I was here, getting XP and Gold in the Jungle, getting Items and levels. And now, its time to take out the trash

Pyrion, what the Fuck are you talking about, this isnt Dota 2 either. My words are backed by nuclear weapons Duncan just seemd to be annoyed by the lack of executions and Rythian was clearly shaken, but Pyrion was oblivious to his words. He was running across the beach at great speed, his sword in the air, running straight at Duncans ship. Apparently ignorant to the several miles of sea between him and Duncan. As soon as he reached the water, he ran straight in, not even bothering to attempt to swim, until he was completely submerged, and didnt surface again. 
Um, ok. On with the current, scheduled, uh, execution of Sjin
Hold it right there! Despite being Miles apart, Lewis, Sjin, Rythian and Duncan all had the same thought: oh no, not again Out of the jungles of the island came a huge monstrosity, a Kaiju in all but name. Sips had found the rarest and best luxury in Civ 5. He had found a giant crab.
At that moment, everyones unanimous second thought was Fuck it after that, everything became jumbled. Rythian pulled a nuclear detonation device from his coat, evidently having gone mad, and trying to kill himself, the crab, and everyone who would remember this mess. Duncan, unsurprisingly, didnt take kindly to this revelation, and was trying to fight his way through to rythian, past his royal guard Sips, who had apparently gained control of the crab and was putting down a helpful claw for Sjin to latch on to
Dont worry Sjin, that nuke wont be able to hurt us, this crab is protected against uranium!
Whos ranium?
Whatre you doing in Tehran Sjin?
Lewis was panicking, and running from one end of the small Island to the other, He had no idea what was going on the crab seemed to have eaten sjin, and Sips was climbing into its mouth to be engulfed. Duncan had had finally managed to fight his way to Rythian, and was wrested control of the detonator. Lewis saw something out of the corner of his eye; pyrion was alive and climbing up the side of the battleship!
And that was when Lewis set his master plan into motion. The crab was immune to uranium and (presumably) radiation, Rythian was trying to kill everyone, but would only really kill himself and Duncan, and Duncan had secured the nuclear detonator but was standing perilously close to the edge of the ship that pyrion was climbing up. If Duncan and Rythian died, he would be able to restore glory to the glorious Moroccan empire! 
Hey Duncan! I have an important message for you! Duncan looked around to see lewis, ignorant of the peril coming to get him from below. Cant it wait Lewis?
No, its vitally important for the safety of humanity
Fine, tell me!
Work the shaft and cup the balls
What happened next would remain with Lewis for the rest of his(extremely short) Life. Pyrion grabbed both of Duncans legs, and dragged him into the sea. Duncan attempted to fight back, and then swim away, but both of them were becoming tangled in Pyrions enormous beard, and they were engulfed by the sea, twisting into the Darkness below. Rythian grabbed the detonator and jammed his hand on the button; the sky became filled with the hum of nuclear missiles. For the first time in days, Lewis was happy; all he needed to do was ask sips for admission into his bizzare crab creature mouth. Sorry guy no can do, you should have shown me more respect, and I always have a plan.
Oh, oh no.  Actually, you know what?  I dont want to rule a world with Giant crabs and a crab based economy. Fuck it. I can win the next Civ game.

And with that dear reader, Sipsco dirt factory conquered the world, The nuclear bombs lit up oblivion. Sjin took for sale $10, and sips took the rest of the world. In some ways, everyone was happy, but, on the other hand, Im guessing theyll be lots of grudges in the next civ game
Because, yknow, Im sure the yogscast will DEFINITELY take this work of fiction on reddit into account.
 




 Well He didn't give me the money to buy the Meld, however, Simon will be... appropriate payment.

I remain 




 Karl Pilkington need an antagonist. Lewis and Simon are far too polite to fill that role. 




 Ok guys, I've been caught with my trousers down, I haven't been able to make a Civ game 'epilogue' like last game because I thought this game would end on Friday. However! I Can write an epilogue in a reddit post, or just put it at the next games first episode's reddit comments. 




 Everyone ignores sips, you just know he's building nukes. 




 It may be wishful thinking on my part, but I would really like to see the xcom units and giant robots brought into this game. I also plan to write a short story to wrap up the last episode like I did with the last Civ game. 




 Nah, sips has this in the bag. 




 Well that's the problem, LLTQ has objectively less content, and, if you played princess maker, you'd know that the amount of content/endings is the best part of the game 




 Long live the queen just isn't very good in it's 'genre'. Being based on an old SNES game called princess maker 2 but having much less functionality and gameplay length. 




 Okay, sorry about this repost from the democracy 3 thread, but I really think you should put this game up for consideration. I think your main strength is that you're an amazingly entertaining character on your own merit, thus, you need a game where funny events naturally happen, rather than as part of cutscenes and setpieces, to help your style of editing and commentary really shine, hence my suggestion

**dwarf fortress**
now, I fully understand that dwarf fortress is a complicated game to play, learn and understand (although not really more complicated than democracy) but this can be greatly alleviated by a few simple mods, and the role playing potential is so great i honestly believe it become the next 'fan favourite' yogscast series(ala skyrim and civ 5) for example, many of the things sips speculates about his towns members doing in towns are actually possible in df. you can name a dwarf uthgerd, give her the name uthgerd, she can get married to old beardo, give birth on a dinner table to uthgerdbeardo3million, have her fight a giant elephant, lose an arm, become the fortresses chief medic, and then become a wearboar(because a wearboar fell into her personal water supply the previous) go beserk and and kill a bunch of elves, all before being killed by uthgerdbeardo3million whilst he's still a baby. the possibilities are literally limitless. I know you've talked about df before in towns,and i think you may have been distracted by it's complexity, but if you liked diplomacy, I will **guarantee** you'll love dwarf fortress
just give it a try ya' magnificent bastard. 




 But why would he need to when I am already sending my men into his base to help him 'secure' the meld? 




 Nein! Ich Bin 100% canadian. 




 Greeting friend!

It has come to my attention that you are short on meld,a disastrous occurrence that puts any persons life on hold.However, I have just inherited my fathers small fortune, and would be able to buy plenty of meld for you and all of your xcom operatives, however, times are tough in my country, and, as Canada is a harsh and desolate place, I have not been allowed access to this vast supply of meld, and may not be for quite some time. However, we must always look to tomorrow! All I need to put the political cogs into motion is for you to tell me the location of your precious xcom base, and I can send a few of my men to 'ahem' Finalize the arrangement.

_Zips
Ceo and head of Exalt operations Canada, and proprietor of _zipsco gravel

I remain 




 And so ends the fall from grace of Sips, the greatest leader France ever saw, conqueror of China, master negotiator, passionate leader, and all round big bastard! Take heed children! Learn your lesson from sips's greed and avarice, and above all, if a strange bald man with a beard offer to let you own 'all of his China' it will probably end badly. 




 So Duncan was trying to kill martin freeman? I knew it!
 




 I liked the concept and idea of a game where you run the country, however, in execution, it was made up of less of the kind of comedy policies you would expect sips to implement ("Free dirt for everyone!") and more of pleasing trade unionists. It was too complicated to be comedically pleasing. However, I do present sips a pitch for a game he could play which would replicate the ideals of the redditors who wanted him to play democracy, namely, terrible decisions affecting people with hilarious consequences, I realize it's not the best game VISUALLY but the potential is such that I want sips to at least give it a try.

**Dwarf fortress**

Now, I fully understand that dwarf fortress is a complicated game to play, learn and understand (Although not really more complicated than democracy) but this can be greatly alleviated by a few simple mods, and the role playing potential is **so** great I honestly believe it become the next 'fan favourite' yogscast series(ala Skyrim and Civ 5) For example, many of the things sips speculates about his towns members doing in Towns are **actually possible** in DF. You can name a dwarf Uthgerd, give her the name uthgerd, she can get married to old beardo, give birth on a dinner table to uthgerdbeardo3million, have her fight a giant elephant, lose an arm, become the fortresses chief medic, and then become a wearboar(because a wearboar fell into her personal water supply the previous) go beserk and and kill a bunch of elves, all before being killed by uthgerdbeardo3million WHILST HE'S STILL A BABY. The possibilities are literally limitless. I know you've talked about DF before in towns,and I think you may have been distracted by it's complexity, but if you liked diplomacy, I will **Gaurantee** You'll Love Dwarf fortress

Just give It a try ya' magnificent bastard.  




 I think the problem is that everyone is POTENTIALLY on the same skill level, but are less 'tryhard' than lewis, Nobody is really trying to beat lewis, as they know that it won't make an entertaining video if everyone gangs up. 




 So the real world equivalent of this is essentially America giving up in world war 2 and giving the entire continent to sweden. 




 Rythian seems to be one of the best players in the civ 5 series, but refuses to EVER stop turtling, for no apparent reason. 




 Yeah, I had a guy who did that decide we should only use agility heroes, because, in his own words, "I've never lossed with it before and if we get farm we're op." We lost, horribly. 




 So just before I was about to go to sleep, I had a moment of inspiration. Rythian should do a playthrough of IJI! Iji is a little known indie freeware game, and a sort-of combination of RPG and Metroidvania. I would quite like to not spoil any more than that, but It would be an excellent series for Rythian to do. It's short,(5-6 hours) has lot of surprises, excellent gameplay, and, more importantly, moral choices and an intriguing story! I really think he should check it out. 




 So is everyone going to be really rusty for the livestream episode? 




 Great! Thank you for the reply, it would be awesome to see a playthrough of SMT x fire emblem whenever that comes out. 




 OK, I will admit somebody has probably already asked for this in some capacity, but after watching him mention it in CIV I think it would be really cool to see Rythian play fire emblem, It would be a really cool follow up to X-com, wouldn't be flagged by nintendo (It's not on the list of games you're not allowed to make money from recording) and you could have even more Iron Man shenanigans than X-com. I gathered from Civ that You'd presumably finished awakening, but honestly you can play every fire emblem in a completely different way, and the series could last for ages with all the DLC's, particularly with all the entertaining and fun rommances and role play.

PS. I realize that this should have really been on the game suggestions thread, but I thought you wouldn't notice due to that thread being a month old. 




 Political affiliations are VERY poor between japan and those two countries due to various wars and nasty stuff. I wouldn't be surprised if Japan needs its own server due to racially motivated attacks from players in China and South Korea (although I'm sure it's not entirely one sided) It's not pretty, but reckon it may be the problem. 




 Tangos were significantly buffed. 




 There's nothing more satisfying from flaring someone on the top tower before the game even starts. 




 Well looks like it's another one of these:

 Beyond NEVER changes the story, The actions of being homeless are essentially slightly different alternative actions, The ryan choice I was talking about was how leaving the bar in a scene(completely arbitrarily) is the only way to keep the relationship open in the ending. Saving one person over the other in walking dead completely changed scenes and kept them alive for 1 and a half episodes to interact with other characters. In Beyond, you can't even die, and choices are ignored that even the most idiotic writer would think of, for example, the party scene has you choose some music, a action that doesn't matter and only wastes your time, BUT what if, for example, Jodie listened to that genre of music you choose all throughout the game; that's far more meaningful than almost every other 'choice' in the game. 




 Really? I watched VGA play it and Literally every choice was heavily signposted and didn't change the overall story at all, Walking dead brought up your choices all the time, whereas in beyond the only real significant choice I saw was whether you got with Ryan or not. 




 Barely any,because it sucked. 




 Yeah but You weren't separated by 20 kills with none of there towers down and 4 people. 




 I think the game whose name duncan was searching for was bionic commando.  




 Rythian,sips,sjin,zoey and nilesy on sipsco, duncan, lewis,simon,turps and strippin on giel guide corporation. Hannah can do commentary. 




 I wanna see some clockwerk, those cogs and flairs are a recipe for hilarity.
 




 She could commentate instead if they really wanted a fair game. 




 I would like to see a ten man dota2 game, which would be easy to edit and lots of fun to watch. 




 Love Monster Hunter! Love to see it with other yogscast members.
 




 It's incredible how youtube seems to know nothing about people who view Youtube videos other than cute cats. 




 I wish Ridge had helped sips and sjin. Derping around is fine, but when they spend so much time making a flashily designed spy car that they can't create so they have to give up without anyone else seeing it, It can be a bit tiresome. 




 Pretty dick move by Lewis to Fire him right after Simon let him join, Why did Simon send that E-mail then? 




 Why aren't they using the lighting mods anymore? Those sunsets and coral reefs seem perfect for them.
 




 I'm glad lewis got reprimanded for attempting to get in the flying machine. Man was not meant to fly, dwarfs were. 




 Funnily enough, and this may be off-topic, but I've actually written a comic, and it should be coming to the webcomic space soon! 




 Especially as from a metagaming sense Stanley canonically has a wife. 




 The apartment ending is terrifying.

 It only applies to videos **without** commentary. The garrys incident stuff was the devs being douchebags. Beside, nintendo doesn't take videos down, they're just allowed free advertising on them. 




 As Duncan stared at lewis from across the table, his eyes painted a portrait, a portrait of a man who led his country to war, with disastrous consequences. A man whose adamant refusal to focus on anything other than science led to widespread famine and drought. "Where did it go wrong?" He mutters to himself, as he takes a laser pen out of his scraggly beard to sign the peace treaty. He hadn't heard from queen sjinsabella of Spain in years, rumor has it she left to the new world with a device to live forever, he wishes he had invented that, but alas,ultimately all that science had led to was a cool pen. If only he had followed religion, apparently he defeated that treacherous Rythian of Crybabia in a mighty battle in a previous life, or so he claimed as the reason for his treachery.

" Are you going to sign it or what, Duncan" said Lewis indignantly, Duncan being little more than a cockroach, wasting his time in its death thoes. "I have a international games in Tesco to attend, y'know **your** city."Rythian began to laugh, a cold, crooked laugh. Duncan didn't say a word, he pressed the laser pen to paper, felt the weight of the dynamite against his chest, and put his thumb over the detonator concealed in the pen.

"TESCO REMEMBERS BIATCH"  Said Duncan as he jammed his hand onto the detonator. As he was engulfed in the ensuing explosion, he knew he had finally won.

In the end it was sips who took over the leaderless byzantine states, and led the world into a better tomorrow,but he knew making the world a fuckin' paradise was only down to Duncans sacrifice. 




 The co- optional podcast was flagged by a bot, and they're now allowed to profit from it and of course, you again ignore the fact that the co-optional podcast was the first time CROSS THE ENTIRETY OF POLARIS that nintendo's policy affected them.Entitled gamers like to think that the big,bad corporation is out to get them, but non commentary playthroughs of MK 7 not being profitable doesn't affect them at all. 




 From another board:Turns out this is not a unique thing. In fact, this is industry wide practice. Nintendo have simply finally decided to do what the rest of the industry already does. If you read the terms of Youtube's monetization service it says:


This is something that other publishers have already been following. This is the reason why networks like Machinima have licensing agreements with game companies in the first place. This is, at this point, standard industry practise, and I think it reflects poorly on every journalist who took this and tried to portray it as some unique attempt by Nintendo to shut down Lets Plays.

Removed the rest of my post, as at this point, it's irrelevant. Nintendo are simply doing what every other game company does. The only exceptions that I can see are Valve, Minecraft and FTL.

So to everyone huffing and saying how they're going to swear off Nintendo for this, I hope this is now going to extend to every other publisher or developer working in the industry.

Furthermore, the only games you can't make money from advertising are very recent games with no commentary, such as mario kart 7, games that weren't being picked up by LPers anyway. Of course, everyone misinterpreted it as THEY WON'T LET ME SHOW MA GAMES EHRMAGAD. 




 Yeah, because not being able to make advertising money from mario kart 7 totally affected the yogscast. 




 From the way they talk about it, all of them already know, and it would only take an hour or two off-screen. 




 also everyone's adamant refusal to play dwarf fortress. 




 The way none of them know much about videogame news and going on, but they all state the bits and pieces of hearsay as fact, like 'we can't record nintendos e3 booth or we'll be banned' 




 That was almost how sips won the last game. Shame they didn't realize the game wasn't over yet. 




 Will Rythians racial(more oil) ever come into play in this series?
