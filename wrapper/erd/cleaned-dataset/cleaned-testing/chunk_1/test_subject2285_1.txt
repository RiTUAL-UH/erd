 I watched the movie after reading Emma's praise about the story.But i was really disappointed with the movie.A total disaster and waste of time. 




 Nah.Diesel is not a sword guy.He's all muscle.Looking forward to it. 




 Good film.Unique and excellent screenplay.Jake and Tony did a great job.
