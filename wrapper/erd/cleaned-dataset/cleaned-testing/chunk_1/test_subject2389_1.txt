 There was a case of a conjoined twin assaulting someone in a barroom brawl. It was decided that he couldn't do any time because that would impinge his twin's freedom. And "it is better to let a guilty man walk free than imprison an innocent one.
Here is Stephen Fry on the subject.

 Mine totally is if I haven't gotten laid in a few weeks.  




 A woman having sex with a lot of men is a bad thing. You wanna get laid, I wanna get laid, and hey maybe next week someone we both know wants to get laid. We're all grown ups here. Just don't lie or cheat.  




 First 'grown up' game I ever played was Borderlands 2. It ruined me for all other games.  




 Anything by Tim Minchin. 




 My Doc Martens. They would be the coolest, most comfortable guy ever. And big. 




 "I could care less"
That means you DO care. Idiots.

 Not a teacher, buuuuut...
I flirted with a teacher I had a crush on all through school, convinced we had chemistry. 
Ran into him about 2 years after I graduated and ended up taking him home. 
I fucking knew it.  




 I lost my virginity to a millionaire ninja named Dr Clever in a castle in Ireland owned by Eric Claptin.  




 Oh I should specify that this approach is for "cold call" type situations where you don't have a lot of time. E.g. The cute girl/guy on the bus. Obviously if you lock eyes in a bar or something have a chat to see if you actually get along.  




 The best pick up line is:
"Hello, I think you are really pretty. Here is my number. If you would like to call me sometime I'd like to hear from you."
Then walk away.
Make sure the number is written down, don't try to get them to put it in their phone. This way she doesn't have to reject you if she's not interested and she can call or message you at her leisureif she is. It's forward and polite without being creepy.
