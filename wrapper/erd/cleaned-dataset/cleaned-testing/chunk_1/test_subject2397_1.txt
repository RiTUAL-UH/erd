 Yeah I'll have to check that out 




 I'll have to find some to try 




 I have them all downloaded on my laptop. I watch the Christmas one every year 




 Idk I've noticed a paradigm shift in which the top comments are always "the nice things" to say 




 IPA's are my favorite type. Elysian is my fav brewery so really anything by them.

Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is always a good go to though 




 Pretty much any Stone is a good time 




 I love that episode so much. Makes me want to give Hermes a hug 




 I've submitted a few now and gotten a couple interviews. It feels a lot better once you get an invite but now I'm all anxious about the actual interview 




 Grab the pitchforks! 




 It's lines from a very famous song 




 I eat my skittle's out of a bowl with a spoon 




 Why this deserves to be in /r/pics:

Good action shot complete with blurr lines

Ornate wood floors and stairs

Segue to discuss dog social behavior

Or ya know, put it on facebook 




 Is there any real point to having a dildo that's 2 feet long? 




 I know budgets can be tight but you'd think between now and 1970 they'd upgrade the phone and calculator 




 Lately I've come to realize that beer is actually the only thing that has kept me sane in college 




 I see OP is taking full advantage of the new Nudity rules 




 Are a combo of Bloodflood pt. 1 and Fitzpleasure? I just listened to it for the first time and thought that was awesome 




 Owen libary is my favorite. 6th floor has a great view and usually empty, and the downstairs has the best computers.  Basement of Holland Terrell is also great. or if you like some distraction the first floor of  the CUB is pretty nice 




 This may sound weird but how old are you? I really can't tell 









 You should have that little dog to the right blow up in some Michael Bay esque way 




 Dammit now I don't know what to believe. How do I know lions even exist?? 




 People complain about that? That's like most of Jim's job at the office 




 It's the cheerleader effect 




 "Oh my gawwwd" 




 I think there's another Pink Floyd song where at the beginning you can hear the Beatles playing, and it's because they were in the same recording studio.  




 /r/thatpeelingfeeling 




 Well the lack of anything substantial in this picture would suggest /r/pics, and the content would suggest /r/mildlyinfuriating, but since this is so incredibly not funny it's gotta be /r/funny 




 Wow yeah you know my life so well from one exaggerated post I made earlier 




 Not sure where you live but most places internships/volunteer opportunities are scarce

I guess Im in the minority here. I need to volunteer at pharmacies and theres only like 2 with dozens of other people goin for it as well 




 At least 3 nights a week my roomates and I bust these 2 games out and play for hours 




 I know right? Like whats next cigarettes? 




 I believe this is "standing up". People who stand up don't actually stand all the way up 




 I would partake in the meet up 




 I love the season's tree one. 




 Your smothering me! 




 Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike  




 I always think that too but of course you can wear jeans with other outfits and what not so it's not like $200 for one day's clothing. The perspective is still scary though 




 And Mr. 99999946121081009472 said math never did anything for anyone.. 




 Going to college in the middle of nowhere has its benefits 




 I like the original one posted the best. It has the best "huge" quality too it, my eyes had to scroll up to realize what all I was seeing 




 Apparently the Torpedo is more than just an extra IPA 




 Anyone interested in chatting on kik? Message me your username. I like science, running, video games, tv shows like Seinfeld, stuff like that. 




 Elysian pumpkin beer though. So good 




 Super soakers were the best back in the day. My neighbor had a full arsenal 




 Thanks, now I can study for anatomy here at home! 




 I will judge the swim wear contest. Maybe the talent part too but I'm pretty busy 




 It also wasn't 2014 




 /r/funny has really outdone itself today with reposts. This is 4th top rated thing today 




 This is how I take all my shots now 




 He could not get out of there fast enough 




 Are all those bones named? Are there any lizard anatomists on reddit? 




 I'll take 5 standard packages 




 /r/shit

I'm just assuming... 




 Glad someone spoke up here. I don't really enjoy dubstep but Skrillex has a good sound and was always fun to dance to 




 My cat is actually pretty good at capturing flies but he can't seem to kill them 




 What has everyone been listening to this week? 

I personally have been listening to Woodkid I think his tracks are awesome and has a great voice. 




 Why would there be a doorbell on a chemical plant to begin with? 




 That has been my thought. That was a huge parking lot. Not only that but it is right in front of Scott coman, like they can't even walk outside now type thing 









 Mustache man in the back wants it 




 "I traded it in for  a microphone"

"Yeah I can see that" 




 I'm not the biggest football expert but.. I'm afraid this is a little too true. I think momentum is important for us and Nevada is a school we should be able to beat. Of course if the WSU team that played Rutgers played Nevada I think we would've won. I do however think our home game schedule will be to our advantage since they're against some tough teams but home field advantage will be in our favor. Go Cougs! 




 Not just landfills but the middle of the Pacific Ocean 




 I'm rewatching the show and I just finished Season 7. Over the seasons I think he is one of the most diverse characters  and although it doesn't always make sense I love that he switches persona's each season especially after he gets back from corporate. 




 Don't tell Ayn Rand 




 That's awesome! Now if only the buses were even a little bit on time 



















 I've seen the show too many times so I tend to get seasons mixed up but I'd say for most the show Marshal is a corporate lawyer which according to the show/real life makes a lot of money. Plus Lily has a teacher's salary albeit not great but still. So why are they always seemingly broke? Even if Lily spent her entire paychecks on clothes I don't see how they'd be tight on money, and Marshal's school debt would be bad but I doubt he doesn't have a plan on it. Any thoughts?

 What would cause every stock to simultaneously "crash"? 





























 I got a tent last summer and haven't been able to use it and don't have a car. I'm wondering if there's any secret spots in Pullman that you could set up a tent for the night without anyone noticing. Anyone know of spots? 














 Could be school work, yard work, boat building anything 







































 Learn anything new? 














 These things can't even breath without being loud 









 I know we have spy satellites and what not up there so why can't we just track the plane with one? 









 If a post is bad then it will not get to the top. If something is funny and hasn't been posted then why not post it? 









 I'll always go to beer personally, too much good flavor 



















 What was facebook like when it was limited to college students?
