 ....um, racrenlew I see what you mean now after looking back up at what I wrote but I didn't write that. I didn't write a lot of the things that are showing up in my post. I tried to write [11:4-9] which I felt really uncomfortable even trying to write once. 




 Wait, what bible verse? I didn't write a single thing related to the bible at all. 









 I think it's funny that movies always have a part where somebody says don't go looking for trouble or you won't like what you find when someone starts digging for info. It's funny because nobody does that in the real world so finding something out is almost always super easy. People love to gossip, right? It fills the gaps in boring work conversations and makes daily life seem way more interesting. You all do it, don't even deny it.

The problem is when everybody that's sharing the same gossip has a minor detail that's different in their version. Like who the fuck was your source? Why would anybody change the story? It's usually never a very interesting detail anyway.

That's not the issue here though. This time not one of the answers was even the same. So let me start from the beginning.

About a year ago, I moved into a really fucking sweet apartment on the outskirts of **[74686520636f6e667573696f6e206f6620746f6e67756573]**. I'm sure you all know that the rent here is cheaper the farther out you go. (if you don't, there's a little pro-tip for you, free of charge) The buildings usually look like they should be out of your price range too, but they're not. I got extra lucky at my place with a corner loft on the top floor with a vaulted ceiling that stretches really high so the whole thing is super spacious and comfy. Or it would be comfy if it weren't for the construction behind the apartment. It started about 3 months after I moved in and hasn't really stopped since. It seems like all hours of the day I hear stupid trucks beepin and boopin all over the place, hauling things from one end of the construction site to the other. The sound of the steel girders clanking in to each other is the worst part though. That awful boom of metal against metal. It became so consistent that I couldn't resist the urge to find out how much longer it was gonna take.

So last Monday I get to the office I work at and start asking around about this building that's going up. I started with **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** in the cubicle across from me.
Oh yeah, it's going to be a hospital.
Then I asked **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** three cubicles away.
My brother and I were just talking about that yesterday. He's positive it's going to be a plastic manufacturing company but I heard it was going to be another Microsoft building. he said.
I finished off my rounds with **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** on 5th that says it's going to be a law firm and the secretary on the main floor that heard on the news it was some up and coming web marketing agency. It was strange but I figured somebody was bound to say the same thing as someone else eventually and then maybe I'd have my answer.

I went over to my friend's place after work to play smash bros and we invited over a few more people to even the odds since he was way better than me (thank you internet for keeping me anonymous because I would never say that to his face). Once **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** and **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** got there, I started up again about the building. I was sure **[61206c6f737420736f756c]** knew because he was an editor for the local paper but even he told me that nobody he worked with could get a solid fact down. More than that, none of the journalists could even get ahold of anyone to ask about it's progress.

Flash forward to today; it all got so much weirder and became the major reason why I'm writing this in the first place. I didn't notice it until just a couple of days ago but they've started removing the steel girders and have instead started building up the main elevator shaft in the center of it all.
Here's a picture I took yesterday: [tower photo 1](http://i.imgur.com/4yb0WxY.jpg)

You can see by the tilt of the rope in that photo that the girder is swinging away from the building. I'm not making this shit up! They're removing everything they worked on for the last year and have switched to working on the elevator only, like some kind of giant tower.

I was confused and a little freaked out when I realized what was happening so after taking the picture I went over there to ask questions but everyone spoke really broken English and every time I stopped someone they just yelled and kept walking. It made sense, I probably wasn't supposed to be walking around inside the gated area anyway. It was getting late and I was getting nowhere, but just as I was giving up and started heading back to my apartment, I noticed a single lone sign off to the left of the entrance that read **[5,433 Cubits and 2 Palms Tower]**. Now that I'd thought about it, this was the only sign in the entire construction site. There weren't even any labels on any tools or work trailers. The porta-potties didn't even have labels! Seriously, like every company gets their porta-potties from the same place so that didn't even seem possible. After looking more closely at the sign I noticed **[11:4-9]** was scribbled in red marker all across the bottom. I knew nobody affiliated with this construction could've wrote the bottom part because it was too rude (even for construction workers) to be on public display and actually made me a little uncomfortable to be standing so close to something so graphic. I left quickly after that.

Now I had a name but I needed to know more, I decided to go back that night after midnight. Here's a picture closer up from when I got there: [tower photo 2](http://i.imgur.com/y4FajHi.jpg)

I walked along the side of the wire fence until I came to the truck gate. I thought I'd have to hop it but it swung open with the slightest push. This was unreal, it shouldn't be this easy to get inside something like this at night. I kept going until I came to a decline in the dirt leading into a basement entrance to the building. Here's are some pictures of the basement entrance area: [tower photo 3](http://i.imgur.com/6favdIT.jpg)

[tower photo 4](http://i.imgur.com/JtZxYB0.jpg)

As you can see, there was a single light on in the back. I stopped abruptly when I noticed it but there shouldn't have been anybody at the construction site this late so I assumed somebody had just forgotten to turn the light off. I slowly started up again on my way down the path when suddenly I heard a box fall deep inside the building with an echo that I swear to god couldn't have been as big as it was. It sounded like it came out of a football stadium. No, that's not even big enough. It was like it bounced off the side of a mountain or deep within a canyon except it was inside! It sent a chill down my spine that forced me to turn back and just as I did, out of the corner of my eye I'm fucking sure I saw a huge beastly face that looked just like **[546865206f6e65207468617420736c656570732062656c6f77 ]** barely illuminated by the light of the room just behind it. From what I could tell in that instant, it was completely motionless. Just watching from afar.

I screamed and sprinted all the way from the basement entrance back to the front door of my apartment. I knew what I really saw had to be the silhouette of what was likely just boxes fueled by adrenaline and that effect being alone in the dark late at night has on you. I started to feel a little better from working that part out. Then just as easily as I got my pulse to slow it sped right back up as I remembered that something had to make that box fall and if it was a person, I'm sure they would've seen me and called after me to get off the property, right? So what the hell was it? What the hell is this building? I couldn't go to the police because they'd know I shouldn't have been there in the first place. I don't want to, but I need to go back tomorrow. I need to know who's building **[5,433 Cubits and 2 Palms Tower]** and why.

Somebody please look back at the pictures and tell me if you see the thing I described in the darkness. I doubt you can see anything because the photos are so dark but I'm too freaked out right now to verify anything myself. I plan to bring my laptop and a better camera with me tomorrow so hopefully I can update right on the spot.
