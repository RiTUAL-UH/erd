 Their confused little brains don't know how to argue with his fundie logic.  So many lols.

 I've read on some other credit card review websites that Capital one and some others do this.  When they pulled their personal credit some months later, their business credit card showed up, even though they were incorporated.

 What's the cream they keep rubbing on themselves before training? 




 A lot of them have trouble traveling due to visa issues or whatever.  So, could it be possible to have a fighter that simply does not fight in the US?  With as many international shows as the company puts on, many countries have much more relaxed visa programs than the United States, so it would allow a fighter to build up a resume against top quality opponents on international cards.

Why couldn't Glover fight in London, Abu Dhabi, Australia, Canada, or Japan (and of course, Brazil) in the last two years under a UFC contract while his U.S. status was being sorted out? 




 Holy fucking shit.  What a god damn disgrace.  Unfortunately, Dana sees nothing but potential ratings with alpha douche nozzles like him, so we'll keep getting these assholes in TUF and in the UFC. 









 Two sites I've noticed are Pinemeadows.com, and Gigagolf.com

-Both websites claim that their clubs can play as well as the big name brands for a fraction of the cost.  Any thoughts?  Are they legit?  Or will these clubs fall apart after three holes? 




 I would like to use my savings as collateral (roughly $25k), since I have no fixed assets.  I think that's called a cash-secured loan, right?  My question is, are the big banks the only option, or are there websites out there that can help me shop around for good rates? 




 I would like to input my league info, and have the analyzer recommend free agents and trades and what not.  I currently use Ziguana, but they are kind of confusing sometimes, and I was wondering if there is anything better. 









 Jered Weaver and Josh Hamilton.  Weaver is 30, and Hamilton is 32.  Which one can sustain their dominance longer?

Edit:  Thanks for all the advice.  I was gonna trade away Weaver for Hamilton and some prospects, but I feel reassured in my decision not to. 

























































































































































































































































































































































































































 I haven't been contacted by mods or anything like that.  Just some political correct and oversensitive "just a few bad apples" religion defending types.

I do this to highlight the backwards culture that I was raised in.  As an exmuslim who's lived in Muslim countries, I have more experience with Islamic brutality and injustice towards women than most.

If political correctness demands that we never say anything negative about Islam, then I will stop posting here.

 
























 More interesting are the mental gymnastics being played by the more liberal muslims, trying pull "no true scottsman" arguments out of their asses left and right.

 Iran is a shia country which claims to follow Shariah law.  But whenever they enact a new law, or carry out a severe punishment of an existing law under the guise of Sharia, most muslims will say "They are shia, so it doesn't count, etc..."

My question is this:  Is Shia sharia so severely differnt than sunni shariah?  Most of the differences in the two sects are historical and are based on theories of succession after the death of the prophet.  So how does this make their laws any different?

When they execute adulterers/whatever, is it not the same sharia law followed and understood by sunnis?

I understand that there are some serious differences in beliefs.  But the laws carried out by Iranian authorities rarely reflect those differences; rather they are laws which are held by both sunnis and shias.

If I am wrong, please correct me 



















 I see videos of these guys posted here quite often, and have been wondering why?

Why these guys above other scholars?  Is it because they are young, and have a better time communicating with the youth?  Because, honestly, their message doesn't seem too different from what the older scholars say.

TLDR:  Just wanted to know why you guys are fans of these guys.


EDIT:  That title should say "What is it..."  sorry, typo. 




 A lot of people here don't subscribe to /r/atheism because it is a cespool of memes and facebook screenshots.  But there is also a lot of substance there.  Most of the good discussions involve Christianity because that is what most western atheists are familiar with.

There are a lot of good links to videos and articles in this subreddit that don't get the attention they deserve because there are just too few of us.  We want /r/atheism to join our cause, but we don't want to get meme'd to death.  

So why not cross post all the good articles and videos from here to that sub?  Are there rules against this?  




 Basically, should I be working out?  My understanding of juice fasting is that we are severely restricting our calorie intake and relying on the nutritional content of the vegetables we ingest to sustain us.  If we start working out, will we just eat through our muscle, since we aren't putting any protein in our bodies? 














 Meaning, is there some kind of device, like an XM satellite radio receiver, but for internet radio instead? 




 It's called Les Mills Pump.  I know this is the P90X sub, but I see Insanity discussed here a lot, and didn't know who else would be knowledgeable enough to give insights.

My question is, for weight loss, is this as good as p90x?  The reason I ask is because I am very intimidated by p90x, and I believe that I must do another, less intense bootcamp before attempting p90x.  Especially because of the cardio and pull ups.

This Les Mills Pump workout seems to be all weigh lifting, all the time.  I know the guys at r/fitness would probably like it because they pretty much rail against cardio whenever they can, so I came to ask you guys. 









 It used to be that in order to be best-of'd, someone would be providing some great insight into an unknown subject matter for a curious redditor, or some great act of kindness that went unnoticed.


Now, it just seems like every pun thread, or even slightly funny joke gets posted here, as if the OPs want credit for finding some hidden secret of reddit that no one else on the entire internet has seen.

But I guess such is the say of reddit.  After seeing the downfall of Insanity Wolf, r/WTF, and r/trees, we shouldn't expect anything less. 




 Gegard Mousasi and King Mo come to mind.  I remember a few years ago people were talking about a Mousasi-Machida superfight.  Would that kind of fight be beneficial to both guys?  What about King Mo?  Being a former Strikeforce champion has to earn some cred in the UFC, right? 




 Even though every article states that this stopped in 2008. 









 Especially with modern electric and ultrasonic brushes that seemingly do as much as dentist tools, it would seem that toothpaste is nothing more than polish.

Do we actually need toothpaste? 




 I'm kind of getting sick and tired of all these 70's and 80's movies clogging up every god damn genre.
