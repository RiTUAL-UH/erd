 Ok well the common answer is free will...

Ok I'm not gid (surprise!) So that is a great question since he would be right there unless of course the answer is free will. 




 Okaay... 




 Ha, ha I can imagine what that would be like :) 




 Ok. I'll pretend to be god...

Because if everything was perfect then no one would be human. Our experiences make us so and we must get into heaven, if everyone was perfect no one would be human. 




 Ok it's a bit rude but too each his own. 









 I'm not God (obviously... stop starring at me, I mean it!) I'm sure you will :) 




 Oh and I hope you enjoy the rest of your time in the navy and good luck at med school :) 




 Well since I was young I've wanted to be a doctor but I've also always loved history and just recently I've been inspired and I want to persue that or medicine. 




 Aaw that's nice. I like that more than anything I've seen so far. Just the reassurance :) 




 Sad, the cancer not your question. 




 Maybe, why don't you try and see, you never know... 




 Ha, ha good luck at med school (that's what I plan on doing, well either that or archaeology. It's always been medicine but now I'm questioning that). 




 Okaay... 




 Interesting :) 




 Okay I'll pretend to be god in two scenarios and answer with what you'd say:

1. You go to heaven, if you're good and hell if you're bad, in heaven you can get what ever you want whenever you want. See dead relative's and friends and live in eternal peace.

2. You do essentially just rot but you still have an overwhelming feeling of peace. 

What do you do? 




 Ha, ha sorry about that :D 




 Yup, I mean it would be nice but I guess that's just the way it is we could try and change it, people have but I don't think people can go without having conflict. 




 Ha, ha I can guarentee if you ask that to God you'll have sex with God :D unless he said maybe. 




 7, 4, 17, 32, 34, 27 




 Just joking I know what you meant :) 




 ?? (Sex talk time :) ) 




 Ha, ha inney? 




 That would be nice but I doubt that we will ever see it happen. 




 Aaah, well lets just say he is tired and wants you to simply ask him :) 




 Ha, ha what would *you* do? 




 Well with every answer comes more questions so it'd be nice to know so we can search for more answers. 




 I think he'd say something like "me"... I think 




 I wonder what he'd say 




 Lets just say you won a raffle and he wants you to ask him :) 




 Ha, ha, simple :s 




 Ha, ha! :D 




 I'd like to know that too :) 




 Ha, ha "still under development" 




 Ha, ha :) 




 Why? Nice, I guess it would be cool to hear the answer :) 




 I would love to know that too :D 




 Lots of people could *probably* answer that but God would answer it better, obviously :) 




 Cool question? 




 Wow guys! You have all asked some really awesome stuff! Keep 'em coming and I will talk to you guys and maybe answer (even though I'm not God, I mean it stop starring... I'm not!) :D 




 I see what you mean. Well I guess others would feel, shocked? 




 Also I just did a quick google search and tons of results came up from last week to last year to 2012, this has been posted a million times. 




 Okay but it **was** on the front page just the other day. 




 Don't get me wrong I love science, I'm acing biology and chemistry and I don't force my beliefs on anyone but I do have a religion: I'm catholic. 




 Actually they did it made the front page not too long ago. 




 Well religious people (like myself) would have reinforced beliefs and others would feel stupid for not believing. I think it would  be simmilar and maybe stop all the stupid internet arguments. 




 Man bear pig, South park! :D 




 This is a repost!  




 No I love dogs and everything to do with them :) 




 Good luck! Here's what I do:

I answer most questions with yes or no. Am I going to get my work done now instead of procrastinating? Yes. Am I going to fap? No. Am I...? Yes/no.

I'm also doing it to have a better outlook on life and change my views about certain things and for religious reasons. Good luck! :D

 You numb your dopamine receptors and it makes sex with real people less pleasureable and fun things in general but only with excessive masturbating. You **CAN** become dependent. It can lower self esteem and make you lazier (and more but this doesn't happen to everyone, like me I chose to stop for personal and religious reasons). 




 Slugs! (Or snails) 




 South park! :D 




 Cause it's easier to sing like that and sounds nice but many still sing in their home accents. 




 Hey good luck and meditation helps a lot! :) Oh by the way I think you should reset your badge.

Anyway don't think of this as bad it's actually great now you can learn from it. :) 




 Hi, I'm 15 so I obviously haven't had sex yet and I don't want to... well not yet, not for at least another 3-5 years and I would only do it with a girl I really care about. Anyway I want to know if there's anyway to get rid of sexual frustration? Since some of you have sex you don't need to worry about it but what kind of things could I do. (Oh and side note, don't know if it's important, I was never addicted to pmo but I wanted to stop anyway for a few reasons). 









 So I'm fifteen years old, I tried nofap a while back for a few reasons. Religion (I'm catholic), for myself, I wanted a better out look on things and to change my view. PMO made me feel like women all fake orgasms and that they're whores (if they're in porn) I shouldn't have judged them. 

I made it to four days last time and decided I would fap, I've never been addicted to it, because I said if I balance it, it's healthy and I don't need porn I can use my mind. All was going well but then I thought ok one porno isn't so bad so I watched some cartoon porn, I was watching it around 3 times a week then I went back to real porn. That's when I said no! No more. I'm gonna do nofap and I'm going to do it right this time. Tomorrow I go from a smiley face to a number 1. It isn't much but it's a big step for me. I've thought, over the last week, you're still early in just do it once, no big deal but straight away I said no. It'll be nice then but what about after? So I always said no and focused on something else. 

I read a post that said always say yes or no for things you're unsure about. Not maybe, not if this happens then, just yes or no. And so far no has been great here and yes has been great in other parts of my life. I know it's early and I have no huge results yet but I can do this and so can you. Good luck. 




 Thanks guys all of you seem to think it's fun with a friend, I'll pick it up :) 




 Hi I'm Devlin, I'm 15 years old and I'm from Scotland. AMA!

***Short Bio***

 I live in a city called Glasgow and I'm going through high school. I play a lot of xbox and I love to read, be it books, comic-books or short stories. My favourite genre is Science-Fiction but I'm open to read any genre. I love to write and I spend a lot of time studying. 

***Update***

 thanks for all of the questions guys/girls! Keep asking and I'll keep answering. I think I should answer this since a lot of you have asked if I like haggis. I've never tried it, I know that's strange but I do love other scottish foods and drinks like lorne sausage, shortbread, tablet, porridge (with milk and sugar) and of course irn bru (I'm drinking some now). :)

Oh and if any of you want any proof just ask and I can link my facebook :) 



















 **EDIT** It now shows me the percentage, it's been around half an hour and it's only at 3 % help! 




 Well I started nofap as an experiment, of sorts. Now I never went long like some of you have and that's fine with me. This is because 

 I was never addicted to porn 

and 

 I learned what I wanted from this.

What did I learn? That nofap is not for me, however, I'm not just going to go and watch a ton of porn but what I am going to do is moderate what I'm doing. I used to fap at least once-twice a day, I would occasionally miss one but I digress. Anyway now I'm going to only do it once-twice a week and maybe miss it every now and then. I think this is perfectly healthy, I won't be consumed by fapping,I'll have more time to spend on other things and I don't have to fight urges like I did these past few days. 

I do owe thanks to nofap because now I know what I want to do. Thank you all.

Who knows, I might want to try nofap again someday bt for now goodbye and thanks :) 




 **EDIT 1** Thanks every one for answering, don't worry I won't be expecting the stuff from porn in real life and I probably won't even use it but if fapping starts to have any kind of negative on me I will stop and come back here also I will only be doing it once, maybe twice, a week. 




 Hi, I'm relatively new here and I haven't relapsed since I started, actually it's been pretty easy. Now, however, all day I've been getting urges. I've been able to put them to bed but now it's just... It's getting to difficult. Even when I get rid of one boner another one isn't far away, and it's not like I'm thinking about or watching porn. I don't want to start again,I know if I make it through the first week I can keep going and I know I'll be disappointed if I fail, HELP! 




 Okay so I want to make it to ninety days and see where it goes from there. I heard the early parts are the hardest, no pun intended, and these first few days have been easy. I've kept my mind busy and when I've thought about fapping I just say no, I don't want to and I focus on something else but today I've had more boners than any other and I thought to myself it's fine because I'm only a few days in but I forced myself not to.

Do any of you have any tips on how I can stop urges when they arise? 









 I was playing games when I was 3 and first completed a game, gta vice city, when I was 4. I completed the  story in a few days and got 100% within a week or two. Then I went back and did all of the previous gtas before continuing on to tomb raider and halo etc 









 I know it's a bit unrealistic but anything can be done. I've been reading up on some tips. Do any of you have any that might help? 














 I just started here and went to add a badge, I thought you mailed them your birthday so I, apparently, haven't fapped since '99 :D 









 Hey, so I recently started meditating and I asked someone (who had been doing it for nine years) if I was doing it right and when I explained what it was like they said that it sounded like I got pretty close to jhana. He then said that that usually takes years for people to achieve. So I did some light reading on it but I don't fully understand it can someone who knows what it is or has experienced it explain it to me please.

**here is what I did the first time**

http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/2ssn39/am_i_meditating_properly/ 




 Hi. I recently started meditating which is making me feel great and I've known about lucid dreaming for a long time. I hear the best way to have them is to train yourself by you know doing something like trying to put your finger through the palm of your hand or holding your nose and still breathing but I've never been able to stick with them. You know getting into the routine of doing them naturally.

I have a few questions...

* is this right? Training yourself?

* if I do do this how long, roughly, should it take before I can lucid dream

* I hear before you can lucid dream you get sleep paralysis and must go straight back to sleep. Is this true?

* does the sleep paralysis happen to everyone?

Answering any of these is greatly appreciated. Thanks. 




 Hi everyone. First off I don't and never have smoked pot but my older brother does. To be honest I can't stand the smell of it and I'm against drugs in general even ones that don't do harm like pot. 

Anyway you all probably know that in school you're told 

"People do drugs to get high... drugs are bad"

But in my school they tend to make a point of it being a personal decision. So they explain it in detail that I know some places in the world don't but of course the teacher hasn't done the drug so...

While I don't smoke it I'm interested to see the appeal of it to those that do. How often do you smoke? Why? When did you first do it?

**EDIT 1** thank you all for your answers so far, keep em' comming. I'm still against smoking it myself but I have found it interesting to see why others do it.

**EDIT 2** Thanks for all the answers guys/gals. I have a different oppinion on weed now. I still don't and won't smoke it, I'm still against drugs in general, but I'm not going to lie I was pretty judgy to those that do now I see that there are a ton of reasons people smoke and I respect that. 




 Hi, I am very new to meditation, seriously I just started today. 

So my first try only lasted a few minutes. I stretched before hand breathed a bit then sat down with my legs crossed. I had my back straight and simply focused on breathing in and out. I imagined a flower opening and shutting with my breath. Then I started 'feeling' (not touching but actually feeling) my body. I started with my toes and move  onto my feet and heels. Then I worked up my legs and into my torso untill I could feel my stomach. After this I started focussing on my breathing again. Then I pictured myself in a beautiful and lush green forrest. I heard birds, smelled flowers and saw a deer. It was beautiful but I only saw it for a few seconds or so. 

Finally I stopped. I felt incredible, so relaxed. To be honest I only did it llike half an hour ago and I still feel great. My stomach feels 'funny' I don't know how to describe it. My hands also feel funny but for them it feels like I'm shivering even though I'm not cold. 

I'm just wondering if this is a good start? I'm definitely intrigued and I'm going to do it again the morning but I'm worried about the possability of an out of body experience. I've heard people can have horrible visions and some feel connected to their hody through a thin chord. To be honest I feel fine about the visions but the obe scares me. 

Is it possible to have one through meditation? If so is there anyway to prevent it? Finally am I doing it properly?

**EDIT 1** is it weird for me to feel this happy? 




 So I have a friend on the internet (through xbox) who recently lost a friend to cancer. He said his brother was a Buddhist monk and taught him how to meditate. He seemed to be dealing with his friends death pretty well although he was obviously saddened.

Anyway I've heard him speak of meditation a few times now. I've done it once before but I was like half asleep and never knew what I was doing. 

I was intrigued so I read up on some basic mediation. I stretched. Felt my body parts. Breathed calmly. I took my self to a forrest in my mind and just relaxed. It only lasted for a few minutes if that but it was really nice feeling and I'm catholic, I've been told meditation is good for religion which I'll definitely have to look into but this looks promising for me. 




 I loved 'psycho' so I was worried that they made this. Season 3 starts soon and I read some reviews which say it's very good. I was worried that it might ruin psycho for me. Anyway is it worth watching? 









 Hi, I'm from Scotland, UK and like I said above I'm fifteen. Go ahead ask me anything! 














 When I play my xbox it will randomly freeze in game or on the dashboard.  This is happening alot! Seriously it just keeps happening, I've tried doing a power cycle but still it keeps happening, any suggestions? 









 I watch a lot of US tv shows and movies but what do they miss out that would be weird compared to the way I live? 









 It seems like we hear a lot about cancer nowadays but why did we not hear about it in say in medieval times or quite as much in the fifties etc? Was it due to fear or just that it has been mutating more in recent years?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your answers you've all been a big help :) 




 Edit: thank you everyone for your great answers! :D 









 I've been seriously considering teaching as a career. I love kids and I would love to be able to imoact them and make school fun while still teaching them what they need to know.

I'm from Scotland, UK so the education system might be different where you're from but I have a few questions...

1. Is it rewarding? I like to think it would be but I don't want to go into it and be disappointed

2. What don't you like about it?

3. What is your favourite thing about it?

Also I want to either teach at a primary school age (elementary) or as a history teacher in a high school.

 




 Please don't get angry at me for asking and if this question offends anyone I'm sorry. Im catholic so I don't understand why you wouldn't want your prophet shown, please explain it. 




 He was looking at pictures of women in thongs were spiderman was walking behind them and he said:

"Yeah, I have a whole subreddit for superhero thong shots"

Other people wouldn't have got that joke. After the episode aired I checked and someone had already made a new subreddit for superhero thong shots...

/r/superherothongshots 









 Okay so I'm from Scotland and I'm in high school. In two weeks time I have prelims, they are essentially practice exams but they're still important cause, well I won't get into it but failing them is bad.

Anyway I'm a pretty smart guy and I never really fail tests but when it comes to exams my mind kind of blocks. I really don't want to fail.

Also I play way to much xbox, I know this but when I have to choose between studying and xbox 7/8 times out of 10 I'll go with xbox even though I know it's the wrong choice.

Anyway I need to know how I can force myself to study and not sit on xbox/reddit.

P.s please don't tell me to pull out my xbox plug I've tried that.
 




 Ok before you answer please don't say that we wear kilts, we only wear them at formal occasions and only some of us do it, they're normally only worn at weddings and funerals. 




 Hey everyone, I'm a HUGE xbox fan. I've had the original and 360 since their launches. I was going to get the xbox one on launch day but decided to wait a year because that's when the games I wanted came out. Anyway I know about the ability to video gameplay and upload it to skydrive and youtube but is it easy to use? 

Can you... add in music?
... make and intro?

Also can you tell me any cool features that you can use with it? 














 Okay so I'm 15 and I've wanted to be a doctor for as long as I can remember. My twin brother has cerebal pulsey (I think that's how you spell it) and slight autism. He can walk and talk and do everything everyone else can do to some degree but when we were young he was in the hospital for an operation and I knew after that, that I wanted to be a doctor.

Anyway I've been well on track. You know highest grades in all my classes and getting great reports but I don't think I'm up to it. I've always been a gamer, seriously I got the original xbox when I was 5 and before that I had the ps2 anyway I've always been able to balance school and gaming but now I find myself on my xbox and writing fanfictions more than anything. 

My grades have started slipping and I know if I stopped gaming I could probably get them back but I don't want to stop completely. Also I have pretty severe asthma so I miss quite alot of school during the winter when it gets bad which makes catching up hard aswell.

I still want to be a doctor but even if I put in the work I don't think I could make it so I would rather focus on something else and pass rather than try for years and fail.

I love writing and I love history. I've considered becoming a history teacher but I don't know if I would enjoy teaching the same stuff over and over again for years. So I thought about becoming a writer but I'm not sure if I would like to write a book or work for a company or anything else. I've started stressing because I don't know what my future will hold and to be honest I'm scared I'm going to mess up and get a crappy job.

Does anyone have any ideas on what I could do? I want to do something that makes me happy but I don't know what that is yet. 





























 Hi everyone, I have an account with everything on it but my sister doesn't. She has only just started playing and I was wondering if anyone could help her out. She doesn't use reddit and she asked me how I got my stuff when I said through reddit she asked if I could get her some. If you can please comment or message me.  














 Ok so I need one that can, as the title says, run both the Sims 3   4, my budget is 400, please leave a link to one that I can buy that I don't need to build (if it's a desktop). I know it's alot to ask but if anyone could help it would be much appreciated, I can  also add delivery charges if I need to. 




 Hey everyone, so I've always been more of a console gamer, only using my laptop for the Sims when gaming on it. Anyway it broke and I need a new one that has the system requirements for me to play both the Sims 3   4 with expansions for 3. Please help. Leave a link to one that I can buy but I only have 400.
