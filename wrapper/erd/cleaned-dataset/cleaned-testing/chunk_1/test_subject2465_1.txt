Snapchat doesn't make any money

Instagram BARELY makes any money...

I can go on and on...but how many of these social apps and e-businesses/websites truly are interested in making money? 

From what it seems to me, many of these firms are looking for buy-outs from bigger firms...not actual inventions that change people's lives and improve social experiences or fix problems. 

A lot of the instant fame and accolades from the creativity of the app world may start out with a legit interest in creating something fun and enjoyable, but when it comes to making money, so few of these items seem to be able to truly turn any legitimate profit outside of the endless pit of buyouts and acquisitions.  




 It stuns me that theres not one available for the iPhone...and I'd much rather have my phone than an extra piece of hardware.

Plus, if I needed it for a test or secure location, i'd know it.  













































































































 *sigh...*

Sounds to me like one of the richest nations on earth really didn't handle it as well as they claim to have.  
































































































































































































































 I got [THIS](http://www.amazon.com/Shure-CBL-M-K-EFS-Three-Button-Control/dp/B0043241X8) for my SE215s and to my surprise, they're UNIVERSALLY terrible.

Mine started fraying within 2 months at the connection to the earphone! It seems to be made with a lower quality than the stock cable. 

I've seen alternatives from Logitech :

...but nothing else. 

Any suggestions?  
















































































































































 I figure most people in here know about this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegals_Program ...and numerous other spies over the years 

Is there any chance they've killed as many people as Phillip and Elizabeth have?

 I am curious if my heel wear is a result of me walking with a backpack over this past year or if the soles on Beckmans are just not that sturdy. 

Any suggestions?
