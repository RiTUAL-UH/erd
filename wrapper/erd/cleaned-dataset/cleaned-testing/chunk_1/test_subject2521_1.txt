 In all honesty, being in love. I know it sounds cheesy and rather ridiculous, but its true. As a kid, I never grew up around lasting relationships and didnt experience dating until after my first year of college. So, for the most part, I had a bad start. Luckily that changed nearly 2 years ago. I still cant believe what Ive gained and cant imagine anything greater!  




 I can just imagine it thinking: 'Don't hate me for being short and fluffy!'

 




 Not to mention immature and illiterate. ^ Future teen mom.  




 We should start a wager on how long it remains open or at least brings in a lot of business. I recall when one opened in Wichita - a month or two later, no one cared. 

No hating against Krispy Kreme (and their fried dough of deliciousness), but do realize it's part of the fastfood fad.   




 See now, this makes us all look bad. Though I typically never admit to living/being from 'that state'.

Also, it snowed in southern Kansas and around the Wichita metropolitan area. I only know that b/c people won't shut up about it on Facebook. Ermahgerd it's snowing - in February - in Kansas!  




 I know you're heard this time and again, but you're only 21. I didn't have my first boyfriend until I was 25. Take time and don't rush into anything.  




 Even if I were to find new coverage, my current diagnosis still wouldn't be covered:

http://www.khiastatepool.com/KHIA-FED/eligibility_requirements.htm

How does that work? Plus why a -6 month- time-frame? I've never understood this.... 




  Are you trolling or are you really completely unaware of Obama attempting to fix everything you just said?

No, but you clearly are.  




 EXACTLY! Anyone can apply for insurance or get insurance, but those with pre-existing conditions are forced to suffer - and - be denied coverage that could help save their life.  




 Too bad I live in a state that doesn't offer government funded programs. 

Coverage in KS: http://www.statecoverage.org/coverage/kansas

Coverage in CA: http://www.statecoverage.org/coverage/california (CA since it offers MSI)

There's a clear difference on how you're covered, based on the state, and premiums received. 

I recall coming across something last month that showed which states receive government funds and which did not - I know KS was on the non-funded list. (Or I have this backward - I'm searching for the site to validate this comment.) 




 That's my current situation, plus thousands of dollars worth of medical bills that weren't covered.  




 I keep hearing too many sides to the story and I can't figure out which is true.

By living in KANSAS, of all states, receiving input on the benefits of ObamaCare are slim to none. I've tried to make sense of it all, but until something is put in place, we really have no idea what to expect.

I should also add that I'm 99.99999999999% against most politicians (and take neither side). What comes out of their mouth and what's written on paper (and mandated in to law), are two different things. I'm afraid whatever Congress has hidden up their sleeve might actually have a detrimental affect on society.

That's also a year away and I'm thousands of dollars in debt for something I can't afford to fix - yet it has a huge impact on my ability to function 'normally', and to hold a job.  




 I understand this post may come as a duh for some redditors out there, but I have something Ive wanted to get off my chest for the past few days.

A couple weeks ago I was diagnosed with a medical condition. Low and behold, it was the underlying cause for every medical problem I have had since I was in high school (12 years). Theses consisted of blackout headaches, sudden vertigo (that would last for weeks), uncontrollable irritability, and the list goes on. 

Now I am left to wonder, how can insurance companies deny me for pre-existing conditions when none were, in fact, the correct diagnosis. I applied for insurance within the past year, after losing what was  provided by the university (as a student), and found myself in quite a struggle because they continuously denied me coverage. Oddly enough, one was a company I had previously received coverage under before turning 18 (parents insurance). 

Now I am left, unable to find reliable insurance because I was misdiagnosed for most of my life. 

Am I the only one out there who feels this is in need of change? If you're denied insurance for reasons that weren't in fact true, how is that working in favor for both the companies and those needing coverage?
 




 Oh it was! I just find it astonishing, given all the research provided, that people still do this. Then again, I have smoked, drank, etc. Now that I'm a few years older, I no longer do either (for the most part) b/c I realized how detrimental it was on my overall health (and well-being). 

Sadly we live in a society (UK, US, etc) that promotes activities that aren't necessarily good for your health. Do realize though, back in the 1940s, smoking was considered cool and was featured 'as the thing to do' in most movies and other cinema. 70+ years later and we (given the scientific proof) know that people weren't as informed as they should have been. Perhaps this is a sign that we need to further inform younger generations of the true hazards this may cause to their health.  




 It's still a classic! If you ask any child of the 80s whether or not they liked 'Men in Tights' (and of course 'Space Balls) - expect a clear YES! We might have a bad taste in films (to some extent) but they're often better than most Hollywood flicks, today.  




 There's a reason we've been told (for how many years now?) to avoid high levels of UV light (aka tanning beds). Of course UV light becomes a problem, when out in the sun, but you stand a greater chance the closer you venture towards the equator OR if you spend a day at the lake and forget to reapply sunscreen. 

Ended up turning bright red (in Playa del Carmen) b/c I was too focused on having fun with the open bar, beach side view and relaxing pool. Didn't realize I was burnt until someone (coincidentally from the same part/state of the US) pointed it out. That trip dramatically turned south. I'm forbidden from using tanning beds by my doctors (increased chance of skin cancer), so when something like that happens, I do my best to never do it again. 

Honestly do not understand peoples fascination with tanning beds. I know someone who's 3 years younger but looks over 10 years older because her skin is permantely damaged and looks leathery - how is that appealing? I understand the warmth is nice, but is it worth it in the long run? 




 I honestly don't care anymore. Just found it odd you used brown when you have blonde hair. That would be the same as if I drew on blonde brows, even though I have dark brown hair. 

Things people post on reddit typically make no sense and I try to sort through and make sense of everything. 

I tried making a point, but all the posts managed to do was take down my karma - clearly not worth it anymore.  




 I meant to post this, but since I was posting via my phone, I couldn't find the link. Here's the link to NIH:

http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000371.htm 




 It depends on the individual. I hate relying on sites like this, but it provides a lot of info on different types of thyroid disorders. If you think you might have one, be sure to contact an endocrinologist:

http://www.m.webmd.com/women/guide/understanding-thyroid-problems-basics 




 Do you experience any other problems with dryness - dry skin (aside from hands), dry hair, etc?

I have the same problem and found out it was caused by a thyroid disorder.  




 I grew up in the 'middle-of-fing-nowhere KS' so I did the same. After a microburst blew through here a few years back, the thought of doing so (again) scares the cr@p out of me! 

I know the sound of silence, that accompanies these sort of storms and yeah, I'll pass on purposely seeing one/ hearing one again. (No hating against storm-spotters, amazed at what they do) 




 Events like this make me lose complete hope in humanity. 


If you live in the NE and still can't figure out snow - there's clearly something wrong. 


It would be equivalent to people in the Midwest, standing outside and watching a tornado. 
 




 I called her office several times over the past few weeks to get my appointment - scheduled for April 1st - move to this coming Friday. She will not provide any information until I get more tests run. Clearly that doesn't help me b/c I'm struggling now....

Hints, again, why I asked people here.  




 Thanks for the obvious, but since I can't see my doctor for nearly a week - decided to ask reddit. 

 




 I use to do yoga until the vertigo started. Never thought about just doing a weight version. Thanks for the tip!  




 I'll look in to the B12. My Endocrinologist insists I do not start any supplements until my next appointment, but I'll see what I can do.  




 I've had an endless battle with vertigo since 2008 - that ended may daily runs and exercise schedule. Any sudden movement will result with abrupt dizziness

I only drink purified water - looking in to getting a better system since the water here isn't too great. Also, I do not drink alcohol and maintain a vegetarian diet.  




 Clearly, being literate isn't a prime focus in these areas.....


 




 I maxed out on laziness with this one. Great to see someone made it even better!!! Thanks for sharing!  




 Pardon my typo: 'Drizzled' Honey

 




 Oh it is! There's no denying that! :-) 




 Lol thanks. More like ma'am and it was a collaborated effort with the bf! :-) 




 This post reminded me that I wrote a paper (in 2010) about 1940s propaganda cartoons, focusing prominently on Theodor Geisel, aka Dr. Seuss. Cant believe I forgot about that. Thanks for the reminder! :-) 




 Just imagine how it would look if you switched the creams :-X. Then again, I'd probably still eat it or at least try to (without laughing). 


There comes a time when being immature is socially acceptable - this would be it.  




 There comes a time when hoarding isn't such a bad thing. This would be a clear example. 

Whenever I travel, I always buy a shot glass or two. Unfortunately I dropped a box after my last move and lost a few. Sad times, but they can easily be replaced. 
 




 I buy locally grown, organic produce. My boyfriend is in the process of looking in to what would be required in becoming self-sufficient, but we'll probably need to hold out on doing so until we move to a bigger place. So are we doing everything we can to lower the chances of receiving bad foods - perhaps not, but we're doing what we can to get by.

Plus we never eat out, so that makes a tremendous difference. 




 People assume we eat salads. The closest I've come to a salad is a thai spring roll. Maintaining a vegetarian (not vegan) lifestyle really isn't that bad, plus it does wonders on your health. Several cultures even rely on vegetarian based diets, so they must be doing something right.

Oh and I still eat dairy and eggs, plus the occassional bacon. 

 




  people have got to work this out for themselves

They live a way of life where incidents like this are 'culturally acceptable'. By knowing that, there's little we can do and if people within the area try to speak up - we know very well what would happen to them. We've seen it on the news recently. 

Citizens are denied to right to speak up against such things and sadly, we can only wish for it to stop.  




 I agree with that too, but we can't always go in and just stop what they're doing. Same would go for what we do here (US) or wherever you happen to live. 

World peace and cultural understanding for all would be a triumphant achievement for man-kind, but it doesn't seem likely to occur anytime soon.  




 I see a dog shaped dust rag, that happens to be lovable, and can still get the work done!

Have to admit, it still looks adorable!  




 The US should look in to implementing such a program. Before graduating high school (2005), I was never offered a course concerning finances. Even after taking college accounting and finance courses, I'm still lost on what it entails. 

But then again, that's why we pay so much this time of year to have someone else do our taxes. Right? 




 Being a vegetarian doesn't seem too bad of a choice when you see this in the news. Not to mention, you never buy prepackaged (especially frozen) food.  




 Sam Brownback and every politician from Missouri would be proud! 



This is truly unfortunate, but it is another culture, and there's very little we can do.
 




 Too many comments to scroll through, but if my math stands correct (please tell me if it doesn't and be sure to explain why) this won't be possible for quite some time - and exists quite a distance from Earth. 

1 light year = 5,878,499,810,000 miles 

13 light years x 5,878,499,810,000 miles = 76,420,497,530,000 miles

It will be several thousand years before humans are even capable of reaching such depths of space.
 









 lol I've tried to do just that, but once I've read the book, I always look for dissimilarities. After taking a class focused on acknowledging this in sports literature, it's hard to stop.  




 Just found it ironic they changed it that much. I loved the book but lost interest in the film for reasons such as that. 

In the tunnel scene:

Book: 'Landslide" by Fleetwood Mac

Film: "Heroes" by David Bowie 

By omitting 'Landslide' and instead using 'Heroes' the meaning to the scene changed completely - at least in an emotional sense.  









 Taste and texture need to match. This is just too weird for me.  




 May I ask what that is? 




 I know this through experience. I suffered a TBI after being hit by a car around the age of 3 (1989). For rehabilitation purposes, my mom was told to buy me a cat. By maintaining a form of companionship with every cat I've had since then, I view it as a learning experience. Especially in learning how to care for another living creature. I understand caring for a cat and caring for a human are completely different things, but it still requires an understanding that's essential for children and adults, alike. 

Also, after the accident I stopped playing with toys. That was due in part to the injury and a 'shift' in my cognitive and neuropsychological abilities - but further emphasizes the companionship maintained with the fury feline friends.  




 HA! I thought the same! (But a little on the heavy side) 




 Thanks for the video! I'll be sure to check it out. I recall the guy appearing on Tosh.O or one of those shows..... 




 Serious mother issues. 

**Clear sign for future generations:** *to avoid incidents such as this, truly know and understand your child. It could have a tremendous impact on what they do/become later in life. Even to this extent.* 




 People have strange obsessions that never make sense. This is a clear sign of that.

Then again, there could be a psychological reason as to why he has a fascination with Miley Cyrus. Also, at what age (for both) did he gain this fascination? Just thinking that increased just how creepy this is.....

 




 I reformatted the post to make it easier to read and to highlight key points. If anyone has a question/comment, please do not hesitate to post. It would provide insight as to whether 1) people noticed this too, 2) if the reddit community finds this interesting, and 3) if it is even relevant.

 My comment was more of a reply to the bolded text.  




 Well that trip just ended.  




 It's still interesting to know. Discovering something out of curiosity isn't a bad thing.  




 I appreciate your posting of this, but the 2nd to last paragraph clearly makes the article pointless to read. It states:

Despite the efforts of the humble earthworm, the vast majority of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - which is responsible for 60% of the total warming from greenhouse gases - is caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.
----------------
But earthworms only account for about 16% of greenhouse gases. How's that a concern? Worms have existed for millennia, but we (humans) haven't.

I understand their intention, but it doesn't seem to account for much. Especially when compared to human interventions.  




 These are known problems when taking birth control and just about every other prescription drug. I stopped taking them due to their constant (and unpleasant) side-effects. Even with an IUD, I still experience problems.

The only downside is the fact some of us take the pill/ use an IUD because we have to for hormonal reasons, not because we're sexually active. In my case, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. May not sound too bad, but I'm only in my mid-20s.  




 For being 'wrong' a lot of people sure did like the post. Maybe you should accept others opinions and not react by telling me my opinion is false or 'made up".

Given the fact I haven't used Reddit for too long, I clearly need to figure more things out. At least I'm willing to do that before accusing people of providing 'false opinions'.  




 I know. I posted about it last week (4 days ago) - but trolls took over the post so I stopped. I have a passion for music and couldn't let this one go.

'The Imposter'
http://www.reddit.com/r/Critics/comments/17lvgo/the_imposter_hailed_as_one_of_the_standout_films/ 




 And that sir/ma'am is why I am here, sharing the documentary with this forum. It's clearly a compelling documentary but I wanted to highlight what made it just that. Clearly few of you agree with me, which is fine, but as I've stated time and again - I found a different underlying meaning based on my own understandings and experiences.  




 Of course it is one of the best documentaries of 2012 but it (the documentary) is popular for what it's showing the world - biases towards music (due to racism, mental health, people being @ssholes, etc.) in the 1970s NOT racism today. He's famous today because individuals took the time to understand his story and share it with world. 

Without the collaboration of the two individuals, the likelihood of you knowing of Rodriguez would be slim to none. He would still remain a legend - unknown to us - but popular in South Africa. Hell, everyone thought he was dead for decades until someone took the time to check and with that curiosity, came this documentary. Now you are left with this post trying to emphasize certain key aspects of the documentary and how it has/could shape what we know today. 




 A lot of time was spent focusing on racial discrimination - not just the record label being a complete @ss. The fact you are continuously refuting my opinion holds no value to me whatsoever and I will remain with the same opinion - whether it's right or wrong. Isn't that the basis for such forums? To express your opinion on a given topic/subject no matter how others react?
 




 I prefer this version, too bad it's not a full-length film - Seven PsychoCATS Trailer HD:

http://youtu.be/gS0P3vU5D_A 




 D@mn you beat me to it! I thought the same thing! Quite a strange assignment..... 




 I just hope such a documentary could help reshape fame in our society. You might ask, why not do it yourself? It's easier said than done and I'm worried no one would even care. It could forever impact what we know and can learn through music but, as you stated, we're living in too dumb of a society to understand such things. 
 




 You are correct. It is something truly worth watching.  




 Your comment brought to light the idea that we (as a society) need to reshape what we view as good. In today's world, it doesn't matter whether or not you have talent. Your luck of rising to fame has to do with looks, sex appeal, etc. 

Rodriguez wrote about the life he lived, but in a manner not accepted by 70s US culture. Shows like American Idol fully emphasize sex appeal and the like, over actual talent. I feel Rodriguez tried to push the boundaries at an earlier stage but we were too ignorant, of a society, to accept this. 

I will agree too on the lack of of musical talent for Bob Dylan, but that only further emphasizes my point. Or at least I think it does. I could be wrong.  




 Then the music industry is to blame? What made Santana any better? They both 'rose to fame' during the same time, but only one received recognition. 

He did everything in his power to sell music, but only 6 ALBUMS were sold in the US. The music was out there, but no one knew of it. Highly doubt that's a coincidence. 

PLUS: People would scratch out his top hit - 'Sugar Man'. Why on earth would people do that unless they wanted to keep him from becoming famous? 




 In order to gain attention, you must first attract people. He wasn't put in the proper position to do that and since race became an issue, that only pushed him further back. If you check, Santana and Jose Feliciano, both gained fame around this same time (late-60s and early-70s) Also, neither one was a US born citizen. Both were from other countries that possibly helped promote their fame. Since Rodriguez did not have an acceptable contract nor willingness from others, he was left in the dumps. Rather sad his music held no purpose where it was produced - US - but a bootleg version - in South Africa - brought him the fame he never thought he'd reach. 

I disagree on quality. I find his songs to hold a lyrical value and his voice only adds to it. One more thing - Bob Dylan rose to fame during the same time - 1960s-1970s. Rodriguez had the unfortunate circumstance of sounding a lot like Dylan, through the sound of his music. Perhaps this held a negative impact on his career. 

I absolutely adore his ability to refrain from accepting the fame - be it for mental, drug or whatever issues - that really doesn't matter. He did not let the fame get to his head and take away what he wanted from life. I would like to see musicians of today refrain from the fame and fortunes of their career - but it's not likely. 


***I have a different way of understanding what happened. Perhaps my approach is different than yours, and others, but I like to gain a clearer understanding as to why he never became famous in the US. I take what I know and go from there. 




 Bob Dylan of Detroit, Michigan - Elvis Presley of South Africa. 

Depends on the location. Either way he never gained popularity in the US (until now) due to his race. Use of the name Rodriguez during the 1970s made listeners refrain from listening b/c they expected him to be 'non-white. Quite an unfortunate story. It's even more remarkable the type of life he maintained (and still maintains) no matter the fame or fortune. 

True understanding of life and the pursuit of happiness. 




 Didn't take it in to consideration when creating the account. Might redo and add hearts or smiley faces to indicate I'm not a guy. Not sure what else to do. I will admit it's quite an amusement since I'm a petite female being referred to as 'sir'.  




 More like ma'am, but you are welcome!  




 Thank your for taking that in to consideration. The problem with forums like this, is the fact you're stuck dealing with trolls.  




 Congrats on understanding the concept of an exaggeration (and/or a foolish statement)! You would be surprised how often it is used to gain appeal from others. Ironically, I had no intentions of this. More so, I stated my overall view of the film. Why, might you ask, did I state (in full-context): 'The story that unfolds is nothing you could have every imagined'?

I have always found the human mind/ human experience (non-religious) to be an amazing thing. When you look right down to it, we still do not understand the true impact of the human mind. Over the next few years I hope to gain a greater understanding of this (through neuropsychology) and I felt The Imposter was an appropriate start 

It really depends on what you are looking for in a film. As a documentary I understood there would be limitations as to what could be shared but, overall, they portrayed the situation rather well. At the start of the documentary, did you expect the story to turn out as it did? I highly doubt this. 

I know several of you hated the move (1/10, etc.) but something about the film clearly struck other viewers. Why else did it receive such renowned support at the Sundance Film Festive and several other awards and nominations?
 




 Welcome! :-) 




 Thank You for posting this!!! I have been debating this very thing for quite some time. Even though I do not have moral support from most I know, this is something I have always found fascinating and can't wait to explore! :-)

I have ideas concerning music that I can't wait to understand in greater detail. Going about this won't be easy, but I hope to do my best!

 K can be seen as the function of 2K for each grouping of cheeseballs taken at a time until only 1 remains. I would grab 2 cheeseballs each time to show the following concept: (start) 13-2(1)=11....13-2(2)=9.....13-2(5)=3...13-2(6)= 1 (final). 

Does that help?

 









 You could say the same thing about marijuana but it: 1) has never killed anyone; 2) won't cause or hasn't shown to cause as debilitating long term affects, and 3) several products used today or ideas still waiting to be discovered....were thought up while under the influence!

 I wish more musicians would do something similar. It wouldn't be necessary for them to give legal rights to someone else, but to instead clarify that a percentage of their work(s) went to help the needy.  




 It's not like she needed another hamburger. How much did she weigh in the 90s? I'm guessing far above what's deemed healthy. If people continually rely on 'celebrities' to make their decisions, we've clearly lost all hope for humanity.
