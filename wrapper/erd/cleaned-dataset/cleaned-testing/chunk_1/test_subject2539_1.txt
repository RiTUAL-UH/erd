 Vonnegut is gute. 




 I love the dance.  




 Harry Potter. Movies came out well lined up to actual grade levels. 




 I read the first one... that's as far as my criticism goes. 




 I liked it because it mirrored some events in my life in a way I had never seen written before. Its long as shit though. 




 Why? 









 I read 2/3 of World War Z when I stopped. It was a fun book, but at the time I was not really reading much so I told myself "Good book, glad I read it." and then i acted like i read the whole thing. 




 Interested in which other of his novels you will read, I myself just finished "Mother Night" and it was the most different of his works. I recommend you read his second best book Cats Cradle (after Sirens of Titan)  




 Started my first Hemingway novel this morning, "The Sun Also Rises". I find it amazing how similar life in 1920's Europe can be to life in modern America. Good book so far. 




 It would be great if I never end up getting very sick, but sadly I most likely  will one day. If I somehow end up reaching a very old age and I cam still stand then I guess I'll read the Dark Tower 




 I don't think anyone considers the PoA film to be bad, its actually one of the better directed ones.  




 I had read order of the phoenix about two weeks within its release and I loved it. School librarian actually set it aside for me. Then when HBP eventually came out, I got spoiled :/ the big spoiler.

didn't read it until years later about a couple months after the fifth film came out. Completely rekindled my love in the series and I read deathly hallows immediately after. I read it again, and I think its my favorite, either 6,5, or 3. 


chamber of secrets was always my least favorite.   




 I have the first four "Gunslinger" Stephen King novels waiting on my bookstand just in case I ever break my leg or get stuck in bed for a long while, I actually don't plan on reading them on my spare time. They are just those just in case books. So what book or series are you saving for the just in case? 




 I just finished "The Road" tonight at 1 am after starting at about 9pm and taking a thirty something minute break at the hundred page milestone. So about 3.5 hours for a 287 page novel. Book was amazing btw, I've had my copy for at least five years and I've attempted starting it twice, getting only to the thirtieth page or so, so I challenged myself tonight to just read the fucking book. Really glad I did, book has entered my top ten.  




 Me too. Libertarianism is an ideology I just don't understand. Civilization is something that time itself has proven to be necessarily governed.  




 I've read very little Sci fi in my life, barely Sci fi actually, just Kurt Vonnegut's work and The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, as you can see I'm more into the light stuff, but I would like branching out. I don't want something too far fetched and I don't want anything military.

any SciFi novels out there that are serious in tone but do not revolve around a military, or a space soldier? 




 ----" The Stranger" Spoilers----- 

I realized that enough time has passed since 10th grade and that I needed to re-read "The Stranger" by Albert Camus. Since I've been reading some Vonnegut lately, I was kind of shocked by how cold Meaursault is in The Stranger, I had been getting accustomed to lively characters, and hilarious narraration so the change of pace took some getting used to. 


"The Stranger" is a very short book, only 120 pages long, so I read it all in one sitting. Interestingly as I read it I kept jumping back in my mind to when I was still in 10th grade, sitting in that class as we discussed in our own little mini trial whether the murder was premeditated or if Mersault had any possible defense. 


I don't reread novels, I feel as if once is good enough, but I'm starting to realize I was wrong. Maybe rereading a book is in a way being in two places of time at once, the first time, and then the now. Or maybe I've just been reading too much Vonnegut and I'm starting to not see time as linear. 




 They're both dead 




 This is now a thing I'll do for the rest of my life. You just saved my life.  




 Lone Survivor is a recent smaller budget film by him that is good.  




 Wish I read this about 3 years ago. 




 It was a really large closet, biggest I ever seen.  




 Not exactly a robbery, more like a breaking and entering. It was a just sold home in my ex girlfriends neighborhood, and it was pretty easy to get in. We go in and look around the house, have sex in the closet, no furniture yet, and then she finds a panini maker inside the kitchen cupboard. We decide to take it. Then I raid the fridge and find four coronas, and we proceed to sit there by ourselves in a strangers new home and drink their beer all sweaty post sex. Months later she breaks up with me. We never told our friends about our little breaking and entering. Sucks that one of my favorite life memories was with someone I never want to see again. 

She kept the panini maker. 
 




 Are you out there typing up code in multiple languages, or do you seldom even use a computer at the workplace? 




 Quentin Tarantino

David Fincher

Ben Affleck 

Paul Thomas Anderson

Zach Snyder 




 Movie made me scream. Needs to be higher on the list. It's a Sam Mendes film correct? 




 You two should become friends 




 I bought the 20 anniversary edition last week. Haven't stopped listening.  




 I always accept fliers. It's so fuckin simple. Grab flyer. Walk ten feet. Read flyer. Throw flyer away.  




 Auditorium is my shit 




 I'm assuming from the thread title and all the other answers in here, that season 2 will be up on St Patricks day  




 Why you gotta say spic tho 




 Cartman. Fuck that fat kid. 


And fuck anybody that emulates his mannerisms.  




 I remember I listened to OBFCL2 first before any other Wu Tang solo project. I immediately got the first one right after this.  




 This is why Aquemini is my favorite Outkast album 




 I have a Vapor Shark and I love it. Store is constantly packed too. Any specific criticisms you hear about VS? 




 oh god 




 spitting on your onion rings 




 Its just "Say Goodbye to Hollywood". But, that's my favorite of his. 




 This movie is just sad. Was trying to watch all the of director's films, Sam Mendes, and I ended up watching this one. 

What the fuck. 
This isn't entertainment, this is isn't escapism. Only reason to watch this film is to make myself feel a little better of my own life. 

I'm sad and I fear marriage now.  




 Phone wallet keys.  

It's the ritual everytime I leave my house.  




 Is there a name for the phenomena of people forgetting how to drive? Sometimes traffic just stops.  




 Related: having to troubleshoot computer issues. I have broken a printer Office Space style before out of rage. Fuck computers 




 They're the worst.  




 Me, having plans fall through. 

If I'm looking forward to something all day, and it gets cancelled my whole day feels like a waste. I could've planned for something else.  









 Why do y'all douches always look so happy?  




 Is there a difference? I thought they usually meant the same thing 




 Hey man, if by douchiest car you mean something better than my year 2000 car... 




 Some people out there have to be at least mildly aware of their douchiness 




 Douchebags always seem like they're having a good time, so this is a question to all douchebags willing to admit it: What's awesome shit that happens to you because you're a douchebag? 




 Toxicity is an amazing album. Have you listened to it? 




 God that's gonna be a great game isn't it.  




 Safe House was pretty succesful film. Made $140 million domesticly. One of his largest films.  




 I love that album. My uncle had gifted me the bootleg when i was like 13.

Motivation is still my pump up song. 




 Buy something with it. Come on, you can afford it. Do something cool with the cash  




 I know, I do awesome things and Im broke. But I'm curious to see what a person with lots of funds does for fun.  









 Great book, first King novel I've ever read. That guy can fucking write.  




 They'll all find out... Soon.  




 I party occasionally, but when I do, I stay next to my friends the whole time. I don't really like meeting new people. 

That first moment when I walk into a party or place with a lot of people, I feel some anxiety, but it goes away if I'm close to my friends.
