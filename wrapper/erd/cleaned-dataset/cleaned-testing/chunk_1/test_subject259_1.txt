 One morning I woke up and started to get ready for school. Normal routine, wake up, have a shower, put on deodorant, get dressed, grab my keys/phone and wallet and head out. Get to the university, reach in my pocket to check the time. Instead of grabbing my phone, somehow I put a stick of deodorant in my pocket and left.  




 For those interested in how this works:  When high heat is applied to food an chemical reaction occurs on the surface of the meat causing a distinctive range of colors and flavors. Although similar in appearance to caramelization these two processes are chemically different with caramelization rely on sugars, and the maillard reaction involving amino acids
TL;DR- add heat to food to get the golden brown and delicious reaction
