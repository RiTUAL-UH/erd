 My name is Anna Smith and I always get Anna Nicole Smith jokes. "Is your middle name Nicole???" No. It's not. 









 "In My Life" has been one of my favorite songs my whole life because I grew up on Beatles. Then my dad passed away when I was 13 and they played that at his funeral and it was the sweetest thing ever. Especially because he got me into The Beatles. It still makes me think of him to this day and that's why I still love the song so much. 




 My dad used to send me these for the few birthdays of mine that he spent in prison. They were all really cute, my favorite was a Super Mario Brothers one. The artwork was exactly the same too, I would think it was made by the same guy. 




 I didn't tell my dad he loved him a week before he OD'd and the last time I talked to him. That's the only time I didn't after a phone call. I was with my friends and thought I was too cool to talk to him. 









 In 8th grade I went all winter without wearing an actual winter coat once. I just wore hoodies. And I walked a mile and a half home from school everyday. AND I live in Michigan. 




 I'm like 3 minutes in to it right now. What am I watching. 




 My high school marching band is playing How Far We've Come for our halftime show and we came up with this really funny dance to it. Not really a question just though I would tell you. I LOVE your music. 




 Well yeah. Our reputation is crap too, I'm sure. :P 




 Yeah I live in Waterford if you know where that is so our reputation isn't much better 




 I live really close to Bloomfield Hills and you guys are known as being really stuck up and pretentious. Not that it's anything near as bad as what Mitt Romney is. Where I live is probably considered really ghetto and/or redneck so. 




 Heh. I get it. I'm gonna message you now. Yeah. 




 Little bit, little bit. This is why we can't have nice things. 




 I actually had a suspicion that you were MY friend Jimmy. But I wasn't sure.  http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/200/296/Waht%20a%20twist.jpg 




 I'm sorry bro *virtual hugs* That's gotta suck. We both kinda sound like we're in the same boat. This guy asked out a girl about 2 or 3 weeks ago and she dumped him after twelve hours and to my knowledge, he's still single. The fact that she dumped him so fast kinda made me smile. Karma, ya know? I'd be a lot less upset with him if he didn't completely cut me off after he promised he didn't want to hurt me but he had to do it because he felt he would have ended up hurting me by the time even worse if we had kept dating. Which sounded like bull to me. and we could be friends. Really, whenever I tried to make things right or talk to him he ignored me and recently deleted me off Facebook. He also kissed another girl near the end of our relationship because they were both going through hard times but he said it didn't mean anything and I didn't find out til about 2 days after our breakup. Sorry I didn't mean to turn that into a rant. But message me sometime dude.3 Feel better. 




 I like to put my iPod on shuffle, recline my seat a little bit, and lay there with my eyes closed and listen to my iPod for hours, or until I fall asleep. I make this rule for myself where I can't skip any songs and I have to listen really hard to the music that is playing. 




 Mr. Blue Sky - Electric Light Orchestra

Drive - Incubus

With a Little Help From My Friends - The Beatles 




 You sound like the coolest guy ever though omfg marry me right here, right now. 




 I wish I knew this going into my last relationship. Really. My SO and I broke up well over a month ago and I'm still so upset about it, and he already moved on. 




 Oh god... 




 I just saw him Wednesday near Detroit and it was great. He's touring with Christina Perri and she is great as well. They're both awesome live and have great stage presence. Jason is very friendly. You'll have a great time. Any questions just ask (: 




 I actually still braid my hair before bed in two braids so it looks kinda of crimped to be honest 




 Haha, I'll drop you a message sometime! :) 




 No. But we did go extremely far on multiple occasions. I'm not gonna say details but it's not much better .-. 




 Thanks! Every week I'm better than I was the week before. So I'm definitely feeling so much better than I did to begin with and I've moved on quite a bit. And yeah you shouldn't pressure anyone for sex. It just ruins things. Wait until you're ready. c: 




 Crappy music in general. I have a "Disney channel stars" station on my Pandora Radio that I listen to regularly... 




 One of my teachers had a big piece of wood shaped like a bass and painted really nicely and it said "Bathroom bass" on it, like "Bathroom Pass" I thought it was kinda cute 




 Yeah I know. I'm not proud. I know it's not an excuse but I was pressured. And the thing is he promised we'd still be friends and that he didn't want to hurt me. Yet he ignores all communication I try to make with him and deleted me off facebook the other day. ;-; 




 How physically far I went with my ex boyfriend. He was my first real relationship and I thought it would last but he dumped me out of he blue one day and moved on while I was still at home crying and listening to Taylor Swift. If I could go back to that day I would have stopped right when it started getting out of hand. 




 I have never liked a guy that wasn't a huge nerd. Really, like I could never date a guy that wasn't nerdy. I have a thing for glasses and curly hair too. And not the "hot nerd" the "nerd nerd" 




 This reminds me of a time me, my mom, and my grandmother were at Disney World. I was about 11 at the time and we were on one of the Disney busses and we were sitting across from two twin boys who were maybe about six or seven years old. They were being obnoxious and screaming and acting like idiots, and at the exact same time me and my grandmother went "SHHH!!!" The kids were dead silent the rest of the ride. 




 My school's marching band is doing How Far We've Come, Yesterday, and Thnks fr the mmrs for the half time show 




 Reversing roles for me. Trying to be friends with ex-BF. Not going well for me. 




 That's exactly what I said. He kissed another girl. They were both having rough times. It was an impulse. I can forgive him. But I'm never gonna forget what he did and how much it hurt me. 




 Wow. Thank you. Really. I'll definitely try that. I guess that's all I need. Some time away, just to act a little reckless. Again, thank you bro. Really helpful. c: 




 My favorite member is probably Paul, because he's extremely talented and I think he has an amazing personality. My favorite album is a hard one, but I have to say Rubber Soul. My favorite Song is In My Life because it brings back a lot of fond memories of my father who passed away last year. My favorite singer is John. I love the Beatles because their music is incredible and they had a huge impact on music history. The Beatles are who I turn to when there's no one else. They're just unbelievable. 




 Why? Just why? Who honestly thought this would be a good idea? 




 I actually really like the smell of skunk. I also love the smell of gasoline and smoke though, so people think I'm weird for that. 




 Thank you c: This is really nice and some of the best advice I've gotten. I have a best friend that has been there through the whole thing but I'm sure she's getting tired of hearing about it. Lol :P 




 I'm 14 years old and one month ago Saturday, my boyfriend (also 14) broke up with me. He said that he was under a lot of stress and was having family issues and that he didn't want to break up with me but he had to because he didn't want to end up hurting me. When he broke up with me, the both of us were just sobbing. Then fast forward about 3 days. I found out he kissed another girl who was raped recently while he was still with me. When I asked him about it, he said that I deserved to know the truth and he did but they were talking about what happened to her and they kissed without thinking, and he has no feelings for her and isn't dating her. I haven't tried talking to him since then and he hasn't tried talking to me, but today I broke and sent him a message on Facebook. It said "Hey, I know you're probably not really wanting to hear from me and idk if you're upset with me or anything but I've been kinda worried about you because of how you were last time we talked, and I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Are things going any better for you at all? /:" He didn't reply yet, but he hasn't been online and I just sent it about 5 hours ago. I was in tears for about the first week of our breakup, then the next two I was fine, and now I'm in pieces again. I saw a picture of him on facebook and legitimately started crying. This boy was my first kiss and my first real boyfriend. We went extremely far physically which is something I'm not proud of, but it's the past. We are going to different high schools this year as well, so I won't be able to see him during school either. I just miss him so much. I keep having dreams that I see him somewhere, and we make up, and everything is back to how it used to be. I just feel like I'm never going to get better. The only thing I want right now is to be able to see him and talk about things. I just need so much closure right now and I just want us to get back together and I want things to be how they used to be. I miss his smile, I miss cuddling with him while we listened to music, I miss Facetiming with him every single day for hours and hours. Reddit, how do I get over it? And should I keep trying to talk to him or should I back off? Thanks.

EDIT: Yeah. He didn't reply to my facebook message. It said that he saw it, but no reply. 




 DFW he says you can still be friends yet makes no effort to talk to you.  




 The reason my ex boyfriend kissed another girl during our relationship is because I was an OAG and even though he insists it wasn't my fault I will always know it was because I wouldn't give him space and assumed the whole relationship would be very long-term. 




 I actually love this. You have a pretty unique and cool sound. Keep it up. 




 Bill, I'm 14 years old and you are the reason I have so much passion for science. I want to major in physics some day. Thank you, you have made such a difference in my life. I probably never would have cared about science otherwise and never would have realized how cool it is. But my question is, what were you like as a teenager?

 I heard this song at the Apple store a while ago. I was trying the headphones on an iPod and this happened to be the song I chose. Been into it ever since. 




 This freaking song. Definitely my favorite on the album, kind of hard to listen to right now though because I just went through a rough breakup and he and I used to listen to this song together all the time. 




 I still read it as Jared until you pointed it out and was really creeped out as to why they would name it. 




 My username is relevant to this post. :'( 









 Oh my gosh, me too. I thought I was the only one. Mine don't sound nearly as strong as yours, but the word "fluffy" I'll think of a little retriever. For verbs I get a still image of someone doing the verb. For whatever reason, a lot of these images are cartoony and look a lot like clip-art. 




 Yes. But it depends on where I'm at and what's going on in my life. At the moment I gotta say it's Always Be My Baby (The David Cook version, I'm not a fan of Mariah Carey). I know that my boyfriend and I are more than likely going to end soon and I can't accept it. That song is describing my feelings down to every last word. 









 My cat was originally Mr. Kitty then we figured out it was a girl and it turned into Ms. Kitty and now it's just Kitty. :3 




 How is Qdoba actually pronounced? I know it's a dumb question but my mom and I were arguing about it. 




 I know that feel. My dog will run up and down the hallway and growl and bark at my grandfather's urn. And this is normally and extremely quiet dog. 









 I don't spend my 4th of July downstate but I'm in Waterford and I heard we have a pretty good fireworks show, but Lake Orion has a very nice one as well. If you're willing to travel I always go to one in East Tawas, it's about a 2 and a half hour drive. It's very nice, bright fireworks on Lake Huron. 




 I have glasses because I'm farsighted. I'm supposed to wear them all the time but I wear them occasionally during the evening while I'm reading or on the internet. I want contacts but I have to wait a little while to get the money. I just don't wear them all the time because I think they make me look extremely nerdy and I don't like them, so I know it's my fault. But my question is, how much worse can my vision get from not wearing them? Scare me into wearing them more often because I know I need to and would if I knew the risks of not wearing them. 




 15, female 




 I actually like writing essays. Too bad I live in Michigan. I write essays in my spare time, come on Tigers. 




 Wow. This is gorgeous. I need to visit here sometime. 




 They can't be comprehended by the human mind. 




 "INTO THE DOME MOTHERFUCKER!"

Jesus Christ I have tears. 









 I actually should have called it Lake Huron, Ontario. I said Michigan because that's where I live and I'm used to it I guess. XD Sorry, broski 




 It is. I don't know why I put Michigan in the title. Probably because I live in Michigan. My bad, brethren. 









 I read "Found this baby" and I was instantly concerned.
