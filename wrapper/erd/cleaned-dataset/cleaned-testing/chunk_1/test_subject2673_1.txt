 Funny ~~re~~post bro 




 Sad to see the comments section has devolved into a java rocks vs java sucks war. As an intermediate level programmer using Android, I got something out of it. He makes some valid points regarding for each loops which require the use of iterator() and Iterators, which can necessitate more GC when used for long lists. The use of static methods also helps when you don't need to access any instance variables. Google's Developer section also points these things out and more in their documentation article about increasing performance: [Link](http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/performance.html) 









 the build up was what made it so good too haha. 




 sick flow and very lyrical for his age. the thing is he has room for improvement too

 Are you referring to Android's "Dalvik" JVM?

 Extreme chunk error is extreme... am I wrong or can people reproduce this with the same seed? Just curious.

 All pretty valid points, thanks for clearing that up. 




 I'm a fan of Hopsin. I think he's pretty lyrical. However, the verse about Obama on Nocturnal Rainbows is extremely ignorant if that's what he actually believes. He mentions the Illuminati as if they actually exist...
