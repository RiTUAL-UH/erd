 This is great, thank you! I am bookmarking this post. Quick question, what the heck is THIS ? A three-prong pair of scissors? Trissors? 




 A fellow Canadian! Yes, you should definitely avoid answering the door if you see some carolers out there. 




 XDDD Oh my gosh. I spent the day Christmas shopping and accidentally answered myself instead of the comment left by /u/I_let_the_dog_out down below. Laughing so hard right now. 




 A fellow Canadian! Yes, you should definitely avoid answering the door if you see some carolers out there. 




 Guys, the t-shirt is CLEARLY going to be haunted as f*ck. 




 I live in Eastern Canada, though I have a feeling distance isn't going to stop these guys. I mean, they did manage to leave my house and make it out of the street within minutes. 




 Funny thing is, I can't read analogue clocks...or roman numerals. The grandfather clock has both on its face. I never know if I'm setting the right time or not. 




 A group of carolers came to my door this evening, and I'm pretty sure at least one of them was dead. I had just gotten out of the shower and was watching re-runs on TV, when I heard the doorbell ring. My heart jumped out of my chest and my first instinct was to run for cover. Call me anti-social, but the sound of the doorbell is one of those things I just cant stand. Whenever I order pizza, I pace back and forth nervously until it arrives. My mind races and I cant focus on anything but the minutes ticking by. I dread the doorbell, and having to answer it. I absolutely dread it with every fiber of my being. My cat, sharing my disapproval, scurried between my legs and fled to my bedroom. I'm not going to lie, there was a big part of me that wished I could hide under my bed with him just so I could avoid having to deal with another living being. In hindsight, maybe I got exactly what I wished for.

 nbsp;

In the past couple of years, there had been a lot of home invasions in my area. To gain access to your house, burglars had taken to dressing up as anything from employees of electric companies, to cops. You wont believe how trusting people are towards those they believe to be in positions of authority. Once inside, the crooks would knock out the homeowner and would steal everything of value. It was a terrible thing: these dicks preyed on the weak and the nave. It wasn't uncommon for them to stoop so low as to attack senior citizens, either. This is why I kept a bat near my door. Now, I confess, it sounds a bit drastic, but its not like I brandished it around and swung it in peoples faces or anything. I kept it out of sight, but within reach. You can never be too careful nowadays. Its not like my cat would be willing to run in and maul an assailant to save me: I needed a bit of protection for my own peace of mind, thats all.

 nbsp;

Just as I reached the entrance, the doorbell rang again, giving me the scare of a lifetime. I jumped several feet in the air and released a high-pitch shriek. Looking through the peephole, I spotted a group of Christmas carolers. I thought it was a little strange that I had not heard them singing at my neighbors door first. Usually, I hear these guys coming from all the way down the street, and I quickly turn off all the lights in the hopes that theyll assume I'm gone and skip my house. Not this time, though. Maybe my neighbors were away, and my house was the first inhabited one these carolers had come across on my street. With a hand reaching towards my bat, I opened the door by a few inches. They didn't even wait for me to say anything, and started chanting a monastic chant. It sounded both beautiful and haunting. There were seven singers, but it sounded like a full choir. The ancient song gave me goose bumps, and I slowly opened the door wider to get a better look. Their voices, coming out of their partially cloaked faces, echoed melodiously in the darkness. I was used to the usual Christmas carols, but these beautiful Gregorian chants made me feel completely at ease.

 nbsp;

Through their somewhat obscured faces, I could see the carolers mouths moving as they inhaled and exhaled pure music. Their songs seemed to pierce me right through my soul. I looked at the carolers, one by one, and examined the features on their faded red and green cloaks. They appeared as ancient as the songs being sung. The clothes were tattered, torn, and dirty. It was impressive: these singers had gone through a lot of trouble to look the part. As my eyes traveled to another singer in the group, I noticed something weird. Though I could distinctively hear a low tone escaping from his lips, his mouth was not moving, He was the tallest of the group, so when I leaned down, I could see the eyes on his bluish face. They were pale and unmoving; they were locked on me, yet the bearded man did not seem to acknowledge my presence. The voices got louder and louder, the splendor of the chants countering the ever-growing fear I felt while looking at the caroler in the back. I dont know what compelled me to do it, but I looked down and started counting their feet. I counted 12 in total, but I could see 7 heads. Something was off.

 nbsp;

The familiar ring of my grandfather clock made me realize Id been standing at the door for over an hour. I gasped and checked my watch to make sure it wasn't a mistake. I had to wind the clock earlier that day, and I know I could have messed it up somehow. There was no mistake: an hour had passed, and I suddenly realized how cold I was. My hands were trembling, my legs were numb, and I could barely move. I looked towards the mirror on my left, and saw that my lips had turned blue. I lifted a hand to tell the carolers to wait for me, shutting the door to prevent more of the winters blistering cold to slide into my house. I started humming their tune, though I've never been much of a singer, so I was rather off-key. From the kitchen pantry, I grabbed canned beans and carrots to donate to whichever charity theyd come from. I could hear the voices fading away one by one. When I opened the door to offer the food, the carolers were gone. There were no traces of them, not even a single footstep in the snow. Still frozen from the inside out, I took a few steps onto the sidewalk and looked down the road: the carolers were nowhere to be seen.

 nbsp;

I know I should be terrified, and I'm not saying I'm not afraid. Its just thatevery time I think about the carolers, their beautiful song echoes in my mind, and I start to feel incredibly calm. All I can say to you now is this: beware of a group of cloaked carolers, because I dont think theyre alive, and I think theyre looking to recruit. I know I didn't make the cut. You might be next. 




 Now that's an ominous-sounding reply, if I ever read one. 




 I know a thing or two about haunted cars. It doesn't end well. 




 Son, theres nothing in the dark that isn't there in the light., my father used to tell me, when he found me screaming in my bed.

 nbsp;

Though I am sure his words were meant to comfort me, my young mind understood a more disturbing implication. My dad wanted me to think that I was as safe in the dark as I was in the light, but it sounded as though I was as vulnerable in the light as I was in the dark. I knew there were monsters in my room, and it terrified me to realize that I could not cast them away with the power of my lamp or the flashlight I kept under my pillow. Turning on the light only meant being able to see the creatures that lurked in the darkness, and that seemed far more horrific. Every night, I trembled in my bed, dreading the day when the monsters would finally decide to turn me into a midnight snack.

 nbsp;

One night, when I was seven, I was woken up by the sound of the phone ringing. I crawled out of bed to eavesdrop on my dad. There was an emergency at work, and he needed to leave urgently. He called my babysitter, who was used to his late-night requests and already knew where to find the spare key. I walked to my window and peered outside in time to catch dad jumping into his van and driving off. His headlights momentarily blinded me, and stripped away what little night vision I had garnered up until then. As I turned towards my bed, I spotted something standing on the other side. I nearly peed myself. Squinting to get a better look, I found that my vision was hindered by a collection of fading bright spots still pulsating in my retinas.

 nbsp;

W-whos there..?, I asked, in a pathetic whimper.

 nbsp;

I reached for my lamp, but became paralysed with fear, remembering my fathers words: theres nothing in the dark that isn't there in the light. It would be pointless to turn on the light. The figure swayed back and forth silently, in an almost hypnotic rhythm. I remember hearing it hissing and making a strange dripping sound. As a row of cars passed in the street, light poured in through my windows. I started to make out the creatures details: its arms were twisted and bony, its hands were a trio of clawed fingers that reminded me of a birds talons, it had three spikes jutting out of each side of its bald head, its eyes glowed like those of a cat in the night, and it wore a loose robe that, as far as I could tell, was made up of light leather with stands of hair attached to it. I had watched enough cowboy and Indian movies to know what a scalp was when I saw one. I wanted to scream and run, but I couldn't move.

 nbsp;

Strangely, the creature did not approach me. Instead, it lurked over my empty bed. Pure luck had bunched the blankets up in such a way as to make it seem like I was still under them. Even as the light faded away, I could see one of the monsters talons slowly reaching towards my blanket. It gripped onto the top and pulled it back, revealing the empty bed. The demonic being stretched its abnormally long neck, peering at the spot where I should have been. It made a series of eerie clicking sounds, just like when you smack your tongue against your palate. When it realized that the bed was empty, it emitted a shrill shriek so loud that I had to cover my ears. I remember that sound so vividly, even to this day. It was like a police siren, but ten times louder and somehow more offensive.

 nbsp;

Lights once again erupted through my window as my babysitter came up the driveway. Her headlights enabled me to see each and every unsettling detail on the creatures horrific face. I could see its sunken, golden eyes, its nostrils sitting in the middle of its nose-less face, and its eerily tiny mouth. The mouth formed a perfect circle about the size of the cap on a water bottle, and was lined with tiny sharp fangs. Some sort of blackish ooze drizzled out of its lipless maw and landed on the bed, soaking into my Ninja Turtles comforter. For some reason, that mouth terrified me more than anything in my life. Just when I thought I could not feel more frightened, it turned its angry head towards me. Its long neck stretched out in my direction, and I thought I was a goner.

 nbsp;

F-Fred Wilkins, 162 Vanier Lane! H-hell be much yummier!, I told it desperately, selling out the jerk that bullied me to save my own skin.

 nbsp;

The creature retracted suddenly and melted between the floorboards. I'm not sure whether it accepted my offering, or if the sound of my front door opening spooked it, but it was gone. I ran out of my room, crying my eyes out. I couldn't tell my babysitter what had happened, but she thankfully understood how frightened I was, and let me sleep in the living room while she watched infomercials on TV. Fred was missing from school the next day, and we were told a few days later that his family up and moved overnight. To this day, I do not know whether that was true or whether it was some sort of cover-up to keep our class from freaking out.

 nbsp;

The creature returned to visit me about once a season. Each time, I gave it another address. Sometimes, it was the address of someone I knew, sometimes it would be random, and I would hope for the best. The monster would disappear and leave me alone until its hunger grew again. I started noticing more and more missing children posters when dad and I went grocery shopping. I felt guilty, but no amount of guilt could win against my fear. Besides, the other kids deserved it, right? If they were so smart, they would have done like me and told the demonic figure to go eat someone else. I tried to reason my guilt away, but in the back of my mind, I knew the truth: the kids on those posters were never coming back.

 nbsp;

The last time I saw the creature, I was eleven years old. The moon was casting an unsettling amount of light into my room. I could feel the beast lingering over me while I hid under the covers. I could hear its shallow breathing and feel my blanket dampening from the black drool coming out of its mouth. It didn't matter how many times I had seen the monster, I never wanted to fully look at it ever again. I closed my eyes tightly, desperately trying to remember an address to give it. I felt its talon gripping my blanket, I heard it make that familiar clicking sound, and I panicked. My mind was a blur and I could not come up with the address Id been rehearsing for weeks, in anticipation of his visit.

 nbsp;

I-if you let me live, you canY-you can have my kids when I grow up! I blurted out.

 nbsp;

The creature paused, as though contemplating the offer. I heard its footsteps as it distanced itself from me, and I slowly pulled the blankets away from my face. It gave me one last look. Its tiny fangs twitched a couple of times. I could have sworn I saw it nod, as it slowly disappeared into the floor.

 nbsp;

***

Honey, theres nothing in the dark that isn't there in the light. I told my daughter last night, when her screams woke me up.

 nbsp;

My daughter said there were monsters in her room. I assured her that there was no such thing as monsters. There is nothing worse than living in fear: I knew that from experience. I reached for her teddy bear, which was sitting dutifully on the shelf, and handed it to her.

 nbsp;

Mr. Scuzzles will protect you., I offered calmly.

 nbsp;

She took the bear and hugged it close as she continued to cry and beg for a nightlight. I refused to get her one. I dont want her to see it when it comes for her. God help me, no one should have to see that thing. 




 Oooh, good job on the story, /u/azaerthes and good job on the narration, /u/LateNightSpooks! I must say, I don't know how you narrators do it. If I tried to narrated anything, my voice would crackle like a teenage boy hitting puberty. It's not pretty.

So to recap: way to go both of you!  




 He got me, too. I was thinking: "Man, what a jerk.", and then I saw who it was. 




 Maybe you filtered out series? 




 Protip: don't try to tell the TSA agents that you were following a clairvoyant's warning. They'll think you're crazy. 




 A few years ago, I worked as a receptionist at a local business dedicated to renting steam cleaner vacuums and providing cleaning services. The business is still open, so I wont give out its name. I was alone one afternoon when I got the most unsettling call of my short-lived career. Here is what happened:

 nbsp;

"Good afternoon. You have reached [BLANK] Steam Cleaning Services and Rentals. Please note that this call may be recorded for training purposes. How may I help you today?", I asked.

 nbsp;

We were actually recording calls in case clients tried to break their contracts. People are typically reluctant to let themselves get recorded if they think its going to bite them in the ass later in court.

 nbsp;

"   Can you get blood    out of carpet?", whispered a man, through heaving breaths.

 nbsp;

Had I not received this inquiry a dozen times before, I would have thought it was highly suspicious. You would be surprised how many people need to get blood out of their carpets. Sure, the callers voice gave me the chills, but I had no reason to be afraid: there were a variety of non-creepy reasons why someone would need blood stains removed. Just a few weeks prior, a young mother stepped on broken glass and accidentally got her crimson juice all over her new rug. These things happen.

 nbsp;

"Yes, sir, we can remove minor blood stains. How much is there to clean?", I asked him, as I turned to my computer and pulled up an order form.

 nbsp;

"Theres  going to be   so much blood.", he answered, sending chills down my spine.

 nbsp;

Unsure of what to make of his response, I decided that I had misheard him. Surely, he just meant it was a large mess. I minimized the order form and looked up our list of affiliates. There are companies specifically designed to clean up things like crime scenes, and we earned a 15% commission on referrals. We couldn't handle a large cleanup job, so I figured I would offer him an alternative.

 nbsp;

"I understand, sir. Unfortunately, we can only tackle small to medium stains. If you like, I can transfer you to one of our partners. Theyll be more than happy to take care of that for you.", I told him cheerfully.

 nbsp;

For five whole minutes, all I heard was the sound of the mans abnormal, asthmatic breathing. It was company policy never to hang up on a customer, so all I could do was wait and play Solitaire while he contemplated his options. My unease grew with every second that ticked by. Finally, I spoke again.

 nbsp;

"Sir? Would you like me to transfer you?", I asked him.

 nbsp;

"no.", he answered. I was relieved to finally hear a voice on the other end. "I need you  ", he finished.

 nbsp;

"Im sorry, sir. As I said beforeits not in our mandate to clean large me-", I began, but he quickly interrupted.

 nbsp;

"Youre going to  lose so much  blood.", he told me, his stoic and hushed tone never faltering.

 nbsp;

To hell with company policy: I hung up without another word. While my heart attempted to leave by body through my throat, I went online and performed a reverse lookup on the callers phone number. I sincerely wished it belonged to one of my coworkers, and that hed been playing a trick on me. It wasn't: there were no known matches. Just as I was finally starting to calm down, I saw my phone blinking. The same number appeared on the caller ID. Against my better judgement, my hand reached for the receiver and I brought it to my ear.

 nbsp;

"Y-yes?", I asked shakily.

 nbsp;

"See   you soon.", he replied.

 nbsp;

I slammed the phone back down and got the hell out of the office, locking up behind me. Once I got home, I called my boss and told him Id fallen ill. The next morning, I came in to work and spotted a couple squad cars in the parking lot. My boss was standing outside the front door, a worried expression on his face. I approached him and asked him what had happened. He told me there had been a break-in.

 nbsp;

"Holy shit. Is everyone all right?! Was anything taken?", I asked, in shock. My boss scratched his head, giving me a perplexed expression.

 nbsp;

"Thats the weird thingthey just smashed your phones recorder, and took one of our old steam vacuums---yknow, the one Marc doodled eyes on?", he told me. 

 nbsp;

My blood froze.

 nbsp;

They never found the criminal. I quit my job a few days later because I didn't feel safe at work. My boss wrote me a pretty good letter of recommendation, and I went on with my life. I probably wouldn't have thought about it again, had I not found the old steam vacuum sitting on my front porch this evening, looking at me with its big cartoonish eyes. I called the cops, but they refused to come. They just told me that leaving junk on someones property wasn't a crime that warranted their attention. But now I know that he knows where I live, and worst of all: judging by the content of the vacuum's tank, he knows how to get blood stains out of carpet now. 




 Its hard to believe that just a week ago, my Christmas tree stood tall and proud in the corner of my living room, bringing me so much joy. Now, I find myself wishing this damn tree had never been brought into my home. What few pine needles remain on it are brown and its trunk is bent over, like an inflexible person reaching for their toes. My ornaments have scattered across the floor, but I dont have the strength to pick them up. I've been feeling really sick these past few days, and its getting worse.

 nbsp;

Last week, I returned from work and found a post-it on my door: Used your shower. Left you a gift. XOXOXO Mom. My parents retired a few years ago and moved to a campground away from the city. It was nice and all, but they didn't have running water in the winter, so they occasionally stopped by to do laundry and to shower. When I opened the door, Rex, my Labrador, greeted me excitedly. I know, I know: its a really stereotypical name. In my defence, I got him when I was 9, and I was all about dinosaurs back then. I still am: I have an awesome T-Rex magnet on my fridge that isn't going anywhere. Rex was surprisingly spry for his old age, and I happily met his demands for attention. Running my hands over his soft black fur, I removed my coat and threw it in the general direction of the nearest hanger. Rex, tail wagging like a metronome on steroids, dragged me to the living room. I smiled as I saw the beautiful Christmas tree my parents had left me. Rex spread out under the tree on a white blanket that had been draped around it, and playfully nibbled at the bottom branches.

 nbsp;

The next day, I put on some holiday music and dug through boxes to find my ornaments. Rex thought hed help me by pulling out random objects and hiding them around my house. There was a sweet scent in the air, like nutmeg mixed with candle wax. I had likely failed to close the lid on one of the Christmas candles. The clumped up sugar in my cupboard was proof of my lazy lid-closing ways. Rex was particularly fond of my new garlands, and helped me unravel them all over the living room floor. It took me fifteen minutes to undo all the knots. He loved watching me struggle. After finding a nice array of older ornaments from my childhood and newer ones Id bought myself after moving out, I began decorating the tree. I remembered the year when I got Rex: he was sitting under the tree on Christmas Eve, wearing a big red bow. Wed been friends ever since. As I continued to hang ornaments, I spotted a few yellowing pine needles. I carefully plucked them off and tossed them in the garbage. Their absence did not take away from the trees splendor.

 nbsp;

After a while, I noticed Rex wasn't by my side any more. I looked around my house and found him curled up on his doggy bed, which was pretty unusual in and of itself. Id only seen him sleep there twice since Id bought the thing. Rex much preferred the foot of my bed. All tuckered out, huh, boy? I teased, scratching him behind the ear. He whined lowly and closed his eyes. I let him be, took a few moments to send my parents a thank-you email with a photo of the decked-out tree, and then started on supper. Before sitting down at the table, I opened a can of Rexs favorite food and poured it in his bowl. I called for him, but he didn't come. He was probably exhausted from the decora-thon. I ate alone for the first time in years. The silence was deafening, but at least I could enjoy the view as I devoured my meal: my tree looked beautiful. I checked on Rex a few times that evening, but he was fast asleep. Lazy bum. My dad answered my email and told me they were cancelling our plans for supper the next day because theyd come down with the flu. I gave them strict instructions to get some rest, and then followed my own advice. I was starting to feel rather worn out myself.

 nbsp;

Over the course of the following days, I saw a steady decline in old Rexs health. I was afraid it was his time. I dreaded it so much that it gave me nightmares. I could barely keep myself from tearing up at work. Wed been through so much together, Rex and I. I wasn't ready to say goodbye. I came home one night to find a collection of yellow and brownish pin needles under the tree. It was starting to thin out, like the top of a middle-aged mans head. I vacuumed the mess, feeling really guilty for being unable to keep the damn tree alive. It was a gift, after all. What would my parents say if they saw it in such a pitiful condition? I stopped in my tracks and realized Id forgotten to greet Rex. I ran to his side and dropped to my knees. I didn't even have to touch him to know he was gone. My lips quivering and my eyes dripping, I gave him a final hug. I'm sorry I wasn't here to say goodbye I murmured. I had to call a friend to take care of him. I couldn't do it myself.

 nbsp;

The next few days passed in a blur. I was so distraught that I called in sick from work. It wasn't a complete lie, since I felt like I had caught what was ailing my parents. I emailed my dad to tell him about Rex. He loved that dog almost as much as I did. He liked to kidnap him for week-long camping trips. He claimed we had shared custody of him. Though my parents laptops were typically at arms reach, I didn't get a reply. Dad was probably moping around the campfire and needed his space. I coped by turning into a complete hermit, leaving the house only once to take out the trash and overflowing recycling bin. I cant remember why the recycling bin was so fullI dont recall putting much stuff into it. Meanwhile, my Christmas tree continued to decay. I was too much of a wreck and too worn-down to bother taking it out to the dumpster. I let it rot slowly in my living room.

 nbsp;

Since yesterday, I've been getting these awful headaches, and my nose keeps bleeding. I spent most of my time lying in bed or sitting at my computer. I wish Rex was here. I wish my parents would reply to my emails. I'm so lonely. I called the friend who took care of Rex for me, but she couldn't stay on the phone very long: seems like I gave her my flu. I wish I wasn't looking at my pathetic excuse for a Christmas tree. Its slouched over and there is not a single ornament left on it. Ugh, the screens getting all blurry, I'm probably going to go to bed soon.

 nbsp;

As I was typing this, I heard a faint hissing sound coming from the tree. I lethargically wheeled my chair over and leaned in to listen. It was like the sound of air escaping a tire, and it was coming from a tiny black tube sticking out of the trunk. Thats when I realized something: the tree had no scent. I should have been able to smell pine or rot or something. Anything. Then, I remembered why the recycling bin had been so full. My mind was distracted when I took it out, but it was coming back to me. There had been a large crumpled-up cardboard box with the picture of a tree on it.

 nbsp;

Artificial Christmas trees aren't supposed to die

 nbsp;

Oh man, I'm starting to feel really dizzyI'm going to go lie down for a while 




 Time to get those pesky braces moved. Ask your orthodontist to tune them in to the station of your choice. 




 I totally agree. As a writer, I get a lot of entertainment from reading the comments and seeing people's theories. Some of the ones they come up with are absolutely awesome. Sometimes, I find myself thinking: "Man, I wish I thought of that." There's no need to over-explain your ending. Just make sure you drop a few hints in your narrative, and then sit back and watch what happens. 




 I would have to agree with what everyone is saying: good title, captivating story, shocking ending, etc. I also think there's a bit of luck and a bit of strategy that goes into it. Personally, I try to post when I see that a lot of people are online but not a lot of stories have been submitted, in the hopes that mine will start off as close to the main page as possible. Then I just keep hitting refresh while quietly sobbing and rocking myself in the corner, hoping that it'll get some upvotes. Then, of course, there's the goat sacrifice...but everyone knows that.

I've also noticed that longer stories get less love. 




 Someone PLEASE make this story happen. Then, as a crazy twist-ending, you find out it's actually a site full of people making gourmet food out of those Easter marshmellowy peeps...
...
...FROM HELL. 




 I wasn't expecting that ending. 




 Something horrible is going to happen, and I need to stop it before its too late. I'm not sure what I can do, except to warn as many people as I can. Please heed this warning if you signed up for the North American MP3 Flash Mob on December 24th, know someone who has, or intend on going shopping that day.

 nbsp;

A week ago, my friend came across a website preparing one of those MP3 flash mobs, just like the ones ImprovEverywhere does. You know, where they give people an mp3 file with pre-recorded instructions, and then let them loose in the community while onlookers gawk in disbelief. I used to watch those videos, but they got old after a while. In any case, the organizers of the flash mob my buddy discovered were trying to break the world record for most participants by spreading the activity across all of North America, and my friend wanted me to join him. I wasn't too keen on doing it, but I owed him one after the bungee jumping fiasco of 09. I went to the address my friend had given me (MP3flashmob.com) to sign up. There were pre-determined meeting spots in malls in every major city. Great. I was going to have to make a fool of myself in a frantic crowd of last-minute Christmas shoppers. After selecting my city from their list, the website brought me to a download page. There were strict instructions NOT to listen to the MP3 until 1:30 p.m. eastern time on December 24th, so that the activity would be as much of a surprise to those witnessing the flash mod, as it would be to those participating.

 nbsp;

After coming home form work this afternoon, I got a little curious. I knew I wasn't supposed to listen to the audio file, but its a damn good thing that I did. I slipped headphones into my ears and pressed PLAY. A bit of Christmas music started playing in the background as the hostess began: Welcome to the North American MP3 Flash Mob experiment! Thank you for participating in todays flash mob. Together, well make history! she said, in a cheery tone of voice. I noticed a very faint hum in the background. It was just outside my hearing and didn't bother me too much, but it was constant and unwavering. I figured it was coming from a piece of equipment in the persons recording studio. My brain soon adjusted to the sound and started drowning it out. Please take a seat. We will begin shortly. chimed the hostess. I sat on my couch and waited for three whole minutes while an elevator-music rendition of Jingle Bells played in my ears.

 nbsp;

Finally, the hostess began relaying simple instructions: raise a hand, look at a stranger, freeze, unfreeze, walk a few paces northwest, etc. They were all fairly harmless things, and even though Id only intended to listen to the MP3, I played along and did everything she requested. Then, she asked me to do the most horrendous thing I could think of: Turn South and dance the Macarena. she insisted, her tone slightly forceful. I was mortified. I was going to have to do this in PUBLIC! Before I even knew what was happening, I realized I was dancing that evil, disgusting, out-dated dance alone in my living room. It was as though my body had automatically reacted to her command. Mind you, I did the most half-assed version of the dance, but I did it none the less. Fortunately, she soon went back to giving me menial tasks. Little did I know; however, things were going to get worse.

 nbsp;

The hostess voice became more and more authoritative with every order, and the constant hum in the background got louder as the MP3 went on. I felt a fog rolling over my mind. I dont know if you've ever passed out before, but if you havent, theres this weird sensation just before it happens. Its like youre walking on clouds, and you cant quite feel your body any more. I've felt that sensation a few times before when my blood pressure dropped so low that I blacked out. Thats exactly how I felt listening to the MP3, minus the part where I wind up face-first on the carpet. I did everything the hostess asked of me: I lifted my hands to the sky, I threw myself onto the floor, and I wiggled around like a worm. I couldn't stop myself even if I wanted to. I was thankful Id closed the curtains in the living room before I started. Had anyone seen me, I think I would have died from embarrassment.

 nbsp;

It was then that the instructions took a more unsettling twist. Nowfind or buy a sharp object. said the woman, pausing for a couple of minutes so I could comply. I walked into my kitchen and grabbed a knife from the drawer. Find somebody wearing a red shirt. Approach them slowly from behind. she told me. I looked around, but I was alone. My inability to follow-through with her command made her control over me waver. Plunge the knife into his or her back. she instructed, her voice dry and firm. Reality dawned on me and I completely froze. The veil lifted from my mind. I looked at my phone in disbelief, and at the knife in my hands. I just barely heard the hostess asking me to carve out the persons heart, when I pulled the cord, popping the headphones out of my ears. Panting heavily, I dropped the knife onto the countertop and backed up against the wall in shock. Thank god I snapped out of it when I did, because my girlfriend came home a few minutes later, and she was wearing a bright red top.

In the hours since, I deleted the audio file, for fear of someone accidentally listening to it. I tried going back to the website to see who was running the flash mob, but the site is gone. I know I'm not the only one who downloaded the MP3. There were thousands of people already signed up for the flash mob when I first visited the website. There were message boards full of users trying to create groups in their cities. I have to stop them, but what can I do? If any of you signed up for a flash mob on December 24th, please PLEASE  please delete the audio file without listening to it. For everyone elsespread the word, be careful, and, for your own safety, dont wear red on Christmas Eve. 




 Aunt Caroline is pretty much the master hide-and-seeker. I mean, she stayed hidden for years after your game! 




 Oooooh, now that is creepy.

Maybe you should check your previous paintings for clues? 




 Really? Sweet, I did not know that. Thank you for your help! 




 I was actually wondering the same thing, so thank you and /u/coraal for answering. On the same token...what if you did not originally mean for the story to be a series, but decided afterwards to add an update? 

Most of my stories are self-contained, but there is one in particular that lends itself well to a continuation, and I think I might go for it. It's too late to label the first one as part of a series...so do I just go for it, add (Update) and put the flair on the second one, even though the first doesn't have that? 




 Damn, what's going to happen to that poor cat? Judy didn't have time to donate to a shelter. 




 Based on photos I saw of her later, I would say no. She looks like my dad and Uncle Steve...if they were women. 




 You're exactly right. It's 50% of the 0.5% that holds family markers.
Edit: Err, in this case, he had 0.09% of the 0.5% that holds family markers. Siblings should have 50% of that 0.5%. 




 It's so weird having people call her my 'aunt', since I didn't even know she'd existed up until a few years ago. Yes, I think I'll snoop around. Not sure if I can get the finger, though. Dad's a little protective of his dolls...wow, that sounded better in my head. 




 It's a given that fourth cousins aren't real people. Otherwise, they'd be first cousins.

But, no. I think I just explained it badly. All humans share 99.5% of their DNA, and the 0.5% left shows family connections. Of the remaining 0.5%, Siblings match 50%, and so on and so forth. 




 It wasn't my mom's hair color, that's for sure. And, yeah, that's one of the things that bothered me, too. I'm starting to wonder if my grandfather was involved. He's the one who insisted they cremate Jessiewas he trying to hide something? 




 It could be! 




 Way to go, you creeped me out! Glad it was just the show.Waitare there typically breathing sounds on TV? Better check the closet


Yes, I will update if I find out anything more. I think it's about time I give old grandma a visit.
 




 If my research leads me to anything, I will definitely keep ya'll posted. 




 I don't think so. I saw a photo of her a little while ago. There's definitely a family resemblance. 




 The finger was in the smallest doll. 




 Does it give you the WET willies?

...

(Sorry dad, if you ever read this. Humor is my coping mechanism for stressful situations.) 




 No worries. I should have included her age. Hmm...I'm not sure whether or not I'll tell my dad. I think it brings him a lot of comfort to have her close to him like that. He might not take the truth very well. 




 Jessie was driving. She was a lot older than my dad. I don't know whose finger it is. I only got the results of the DNA test today, and all it could tell me was whether or not the finger's DNA matched my dad's. 




 Throughout my childhood, I wondered what was in the box my father kept on the mantel. Hed given my sister and I clear instructions never to touch it, in a tone of voice so authoritative that we dared not give in to our curiosity. Our only clue was a small label on its side that read Russian Nesting Dolls. Since none of the boxes in the house were properly labeled, we werent sure what to make of it. I only discovered the truth one night several years ago, when my father and I were sharing drinks and watching a hockey game. I confess: I was not expecting what he told me and showed me that night. I think that, had it not been for the half-dozen Molsons hed downed that evening, he would never have opened the box in front of me. My dad pushed his recliner back, a bottle in his hand, and watched the Zamboni make its way onto the ice. With a quiet sip, he began telling me the story.

 nbsp;

Much to my surprise, he revealed that he had an older sister, Jessie. Up until then, I thought Uncle Steve was his only sibling. When my dad was seven years old, Jessie got into a car accident after a night on the town. Automobile versus tree, and the tree won by a landslide. The damage was so severe that Jessie needed a closed casket funeral. Dads old man insisted they cremate her body. Once dad had gotten a little older, his mother revealed more details about the accident: a branch had taken Jessies head nearly entirely off her shoulders, and her body had been crushed and twisted at unnatural angles. Some of the rescue workers on scene, seasoned professionals used to blood and gore, quit their jobs after that night. As my father spoke, he pushed himself off the couch and walked over to the box on the mantel. I asked if her ashes were inside, but he shook his head. He brought the box over to the sofa, took a seat, and ran his hand delicately against its grainy surface.

 nbsp;

After a slight moment of hesitation, my father pushed open the small wooden slab at the front of the box, revealing a Russian Nesting Doll tucked neatly in a bed of straw. He told me the box had come in the mail exactly ten years to the day after his sisters death. There was no postmark or return address. He turned the slab over to expose a sentence written in red ink: I will always be with you. it read. The name Jessie had been signed underneath and the dot on the i" had been replaced with a heart. Dad insisted it was her handwriting, and tears welled up in his eyes as he gently grazed the now faded markings with the tips of his fingers. I had never seen my dad get so emotional before. It was a little uncomfortable. I took a sip of beer and leaned closer, examining the doll in the box. It was painted like any typical Russian Nesting Doll: a beautiful young womans smiling face, a floral shawl around her neck, small arms at her sides, a rose on her stomach, and a red base. My father followed my gaze to the doll and sighed. The game came back on, and he set the conversation aside to watch, his stern face locked on the screen.

 nbsp;

Holding my tongue until the break between the 2nd and 3rd periods, I barely paid attention to the television. From the disapproving groans being emitted by my dad, I could tell our team was losing again. As soon as the 2nd period ended, I turned to my father and asked him why he never put the dolls out on display. He said he would show me why; if I was man enough to handle it. I puffed my chest in an exaggerated manner and snarled Nurgh. Guh! ME MAN! in a caveman-esque voice. He clutched the doll and pried it open, pulling out the smaller one inside. She was creepier than the first, but still looked fairly normal. She had all the same features, except for two things: she was frowning and the rose on her stomach was black. Noticing the unimpressed look on my face, he popped the second doll open. The third doll filled me with a sense of unease. Its face seemed more demonic, and small fangs protruded from its painted lips. A thorny vine had replaced the rose on its belly, and her clawed fingers gave her a monstrous appearance. OK, I was beginning to understand why he never showed these off. My father cringed, not wanting to reveal the next doll, so I offered him another beer to soothe his nerves.

 nbsp;

A few minutes passed in silence before my father freed the fourth figure. This one really stunned me. It had devilish horns and an angry face. It looked evil. I could feel a weird pressure in my chest. Maybe it was my imagination, but I felt like it was getting harder to breathe. The doll had thick eyebrows, soulless eyes, and a goatee. Instead of a shawl around its neck, it had barbed wire. Its long, bony and clawed fingers were holding the severed head of the first doll in the series. Just looking at it made my skin crawl. God damn, there was something seriously wrong about it. My father downed the beer in his hands and slipped it between his knees. He plucked the doll open and showed me the fifth and final one. It was a little girl with a tormented face. She had blood dripping all around her neck. Her base was painted to look like flames. Of all the dolls, that one scared me the most. I could practically hear anguished screams coming out of her wide-open mouth. Chills ran up and down my spine as I took it in. If I wasnt freaked out enough already, my father said something that ensured I would not sleep that night: Looks just like Jessie.

 nbsp;

The array of dolls disturbed me greatly, and I cursed my innate curiosity. It was then that I noticed a crease in the middle of the smallest doll. Against my better judgment, I asked my father if there was another doll inside. He shook his head. His pained lips turned into a light, almost mournful smile. He carefully opened the lid, revealing something wrapped in a yellowish newspaper tied together with twine. He slowly started to undo the knot, and my heart raced faster and faster with each passing second. I wish I could un-see what I saw that night. I knew what it was before my eyes even caught a glimpse of it. It was as though my brain had filled in the blank all on its own. Inside the newspaper was a shriveled human finger. It had been ripped off at its base, and a broken metacarpal bone stuck out of the old-raisin-like flesh dangling at the bottom. I brought a hand to my mouth and bolted towards the washroom, expulsing beer and peanuts into the porcelain throne. Why had he kept it?! What if my sister and I had seen it? What if it had fallen from the mantel and opened somehow? Did mom know? Was it even LEGAL to keep human remains? Between the gurgles and flushes, I heard my dad snapping the dolls shut one by one. He moved the box to his room the next morning. I never confronted him about it.

 nbsp;

One little detail kept nagging at me, and though I tried to forget about the whole thing, I couldnt get my mind off of it. How had his sister sent him her finger after she passed away? Maybe my grandmother had found the box in the garage one night and left it out for dad without checking its contents, but then, how had the finger gotten inside? I needed to know. Earlier this year, I was watering my parents plants while they were away on vacation, when I saw the box on dads bedside table. I took it home and ordered a DNA testing kit. Along with a few pieces of my dads hair, taken from his comb, I sent a piece of the finger to the lab. Id forgotten all about it until today. Its not like on TV: it can take months to get results. Just so you know, all humans share about 99.5% of their DNA. The remaining 0.5% contains family markers, so to speak. Though there are exceptions, the DNA between siblings usually matches up at around 50%, as opposed to, say, fourth cousins, who match up at 0.20%. Which is to say, when I received the results in the mail today and they came back at a mere 0.09% match, I knew the finger did not belong to his sister. 




 Last week, I saw a ghost. I was walking home one evening, admiring the Christmas lights hanging in a residential neighborhood, when I spotted a girl standing in a courtyard, holding a weakly lit match between her trembling fingers. She was barely visible, but I could make out the outline of her body, her flowing white dress, and her long dark hair. Judging by her height, and what little I could make of her, I would say she must have been about 9 years of age. Her features were blurred, like looking through a fog-coated car window, which gave her face the impression of being entirely smooth. She was hunched over, as though trying to warm herself up. Now, you would think that I would have been afraid, that I would have shrieked at the top of my lungs and gone running in the other direction, snot and tears flowing freely from the orifices of my face. The thing is, it was not the first time I had seen a ghostly apparition, and I learned over the years that it was best not to meddle or call attention to oneself. I stood there and watched her, neither moving away nor closer, until the flame on her match died out and she disappeared.
 
 nbsp;

The next day, despite the tight deadline under which I was working, my mind kept wandering back to the girl in the courtyard. She reminded me of The Little Match Girl from the old folk tale, though perhaps that was because the holidays were around the corner. As I inputted a few figures in my spreadsheet, my thoughts drifted to the first time I had seen a spirit. I was 7 years old, alone in the playground near my house. I swayed on the swings, imagining I was Spider-man slinging my way through the city. At some point, I got tired and stopped putting effort into moving the swing, yet I maintained the same speed and velocity for several minutes. I eventually turned my head around and saw an old woman pushing my seat every time it came within reach. I was too young to ask questions and enjoyed the free ride, until a rumbling in my belly reminded me I had to go home for supper. Sorry. I need to get off. I told her, my tone polite and respectful. She neither replied, nor stopped pushing me. Thanks mam, but I have to go home. I tried to explain, but she continued. Try as I might, I could not get her attention. I jumped off the swing with the next push and landed skillfully on my feet, turning around so I could thank her properly, but she was gone.

 nbsp;
 
Having spent most of my shift reliving old memories, I decided to stay late to make up for my uncompleted work. The sun had set by the time I got out of the office, and snow spiralled to the ground, glistening like stardust in the streetlights cone-shaped beams. I zipped my coat and tightened my scarf. My breath moistened the fabric and a small forest of icicles appeared over the blue fleece. Out of curiosity, I made my way to the same residential area I had visited the night before, wanting to see if the little girl would appear again. Sure enough, her ghostly figure stood in the yard. I could see her more clearly this time. Not only was she more opaque, but her features were also better defined: I could make out the curb of a nose, slight indents where eye sockets should have been, and folds in her dress. The Little Match Girl sobbed quietly, the sound was soft yet it had an otherworldly quality to it. Although I knew she was the source of the cries, the sound seemed to emerge from all around. Her tiny hands shivered as they clutched the match, and her bare feet dug into the snowy ground. Keeping a safe distance, I observed her while the flame slowly went out, taking her with it.
 
 nbsp;

Exhausted and freezing cold, I slipped into the shower as soon as I got home. I thought about one of my other experiences with the supernatural. I was in the midst of a full teenage rebellion; I had taken to wearing spiky leather bracelets and listening to shitty punk-rock bands. I was through with authority and made damn sure everyone knew: adults were stupid, the system was corrupt, and anarchy ruled. I did not even know what anarchy meant, but I wore its red logo proudly and scrawled it on the bathroom walls, like an idiot. My grades started slipping, and I was forced to stay after school with a tutor. As an ex-member of the student council, I was accustomed to wandering my schools empty hallways at night. I was on my way upstairs to get something from my locker when I heard my name being called in a low, moaning voice. A word of advice: if you ever hear someone whispering your name when you know you are alone, do NOT turn around. I spun on my heels, and what I saw chilled me to the bone. It was Samantha, a classmate who had drowned that summer at her familys cottage. She was blue and her bloated arms stretched out towards me. I screamed and, in my panic, lost my footing. The janitor found me passed out at the foot of the stairs. I spent the rest of the semester in a cast.

 nbsp;
 
Christmas music blared from my co-workers radio the next morning. I groaned and ducked behind my cubicle wall, desperately hoping the thin separators would drown out the noise. Alas, there was no escape from my overzealous compatriots tunes. I am no Grinch: not a single living mortal can handle eight hours of non-stop Christmas hits for an entire month. With every jingle bell, I felt my holiday cheer slowly being sucked out of me. I was so happy when the music stopped, that I failed to realize how late it was. Once I finally saw the clock, I hurriedly grabbed my things and headed out the door, locking up behind me. I walked quickly towards the Little Match Girls house, hoping I was not too late. I was convinced I would see her again. I could hear her sobs all the way down the street this time. I planted myself on the same spot from which I starred the two previous nights, and watched. The flame on her match seemed brighter than ever, and it illuminated her features perfectly. I could see tears rolling down her soft white cheeks. Her ornate lace dress blew gently in the breeze. Her silky hair was tangled like the worlds worst case of bed head. Her lips were pursed in a permanent frown, while her closed eyes squeezed more and more droplets onto her gown. She looked cold, and my heart broke for her. There was nothing I could do but offer her an audience until the light of her match fizzled away.

 nbsp;
 
I made my way back home, buying a pre-cooked chicken and a loaf of bread from the grocery store around the corner. I ate while idly browsing the web. I thought about another strange occurrence in my past. I was in my early 20s, walking across a bridge when I saw a shadow on the ground to my right. I figured someone was walking behind me. When I checked, I realized I was alone. The shadow matched my pace perfectly, but its form was completely different from my own. The sun was setting, and it was just bright enough for shadows to stretch out for meters, but dark enough for the street lights to be on. Since I was alone, I assumed two beams of light had caught me from different angles. When a second shadow appeared on my left, I got a little nervous. I waved my hand, hoping to see the motion repeated by both strange shadows, but to my horror, they did not react. I walked faster, the shadows following suit. A third shadow crept up in front of me, and I jumped into the street, bolting towards the end of the bridge as fast as my feet could take me. I did not stop running until I was off the bridge. I turned around and saw the trio rise from the ground and form a odd, disproportionate humanoid shape. It extended its arm and set its hand against the railing, squeezing it as though to show its might. The thick metal buckled under the pressure. As soon as I had caught my breath, I started running again. I was afraid it would pursue me, but it stayed on the bridge.

 nbsp;

After a nights rest, I crawled out of bed and got ready for work. I could feel a flu coming on, but getting the project done was more important than my health. Forehead burning and nose running, I forced my way to the office and slumped down on the computer chair. I did not have the energy to take the long walk home that took me by the Little Match Girls house, so I chose a faster route. Snow crunched and crackled beneath my worn boots as I walked down the street. I was running out of steam and sat on a bench to regain my strength. I looked up at the dark night sky, hearing the distant sound of a girls giggles. This might sound silly, but I saw a shooting star, and it gave me enough pep in my step to finish the journey home. I went straight to bed and thought about the child that had gone missing from my park all those years ago, and how no one had found any trace of him since. I thought about the freshmen that had fallen down the stairs and broken his neck a week after I had fallen in that same stairwell. High school officials claimed he had tripped on a crack in the stairs. Finally, I thought about the young woman and her baby, which had been hit head-on by a car that had slipped on the icy bridge the day after I had been chased by shadows. They had been crushed against the railing, right where the shadow stood watching me. None of these victims knew what I learned over the years: its best not to meddle or call attention to oneself. It never ends well.

 nbsp;
 
Reporters covered the story the next morning on the news. The house where I had seen the Little Match Girl had caught fire and burned down in the evening. No survivors. Yesterday, I saw the vague outline of the Little Match Girl standing outside another house across town. Maybe I should warn the owners, but, as I said, its best not to meddle: I dont want to be the next victim. 




 Oh man, that last paragraph was pretty much the epitome of creepy. You definitely shouldn't go back to that mall. EVER. 




 As I read this, I kept thinking to myself "DON'T LOOK INSIDE!", expecting there to be some hideous creature or mega-pervert looking back at you. This was NOT what I expected, and somehow, it is so much more disturbing. I have chills just thinking about it. 




 I put a few updates at the bottom of the post. I haven't been able to figure out who Ryan is (or was). No Deacon, either. Just...weird stuff going on in my home. Missing objects, weird shadows. I think I've just gotten hyper-sensitized to the weirdness now. 




 Congrats you guys, well earned. : ) 




 Oh...
*Puts his exacto knife away.* 




 Maybe you're about to become the brand new Shelly. The old one was getting a little too old. 




 Maybe you're phasing in and out of a parallel universe? Sometimes, you only know because of little things...like a statue facing the wrong way, or a piece of jewellery being made of a different material...and sometimes, it's bigger things like an entire office full of workers disappearing. 




 Lily's pushing Daisies. 




 This made me giggle to the point that my cat looked at me like I was crazy. 




 I would like to submit [Recently Opened Documents](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2mpxkf/recently_opened_documents/) to the contest. Thank you. 




 Facial features not recognized. chimed a womans monotone voice. I cursed beneath my breath. This laptop had been lying in my apartment for days now, and I still couldnt get it unlocked. My attempts at reinstalling the operating system were met with complete failure. Now, Im no crook, but when I saw this fancy piece of equipment left unguarded on a patio table in some strangers yard a couple of days ago, I couldnt keep my hands from snatching it and dropping it into my backpack. Anyone rich enough to afford a laptop with such advanced security features, and smug enough to leave it unattended, is rich enough to replace it. It was time to take matters into my own hands. But, if only Id known what a huge mistake I was about to make, I would never have taken the laptop in the first place.

It started off innocently enough. Once evening, I returned to the house where I found the laptop and casually glanced through the window from the sidewalk. A beautiful young brunette with a tight yoga body paraded about in the living room. I needed to know her name: I wanted to look her up online so I could get a photo to unlock the laptop. The next morning, I waited a few houses down for her to leave for work. She never even noticed my car tailing hers all the way to a parking lot outside a government agency building. She parked under a maple tree and smiled a beautiful smile that brought butterflies to my stomach. I ducked behind my dashboard as she exited her car and slammed the door shut with an audible THUD. As she made her way to the building, I began to feel a twinge of regret. This was weird, right? Here I was, stalking a perfect stranger so I could break into her laptop. I felt like the scum of the universe. I turned the car around and went home.

That night, I sat in front of the sealed laptop, drumming my fingertips nervously against its cover. I wondered what kind of stuff she had stored on its hardrive. Naked pictures of herself, perhaps? I pushed the damn thing away, but curiosity boiled within me. What was so important that it required this kind of security measure? I groaned and reached into my trusty candy bowl for a handful of goodies. It was an elegant glass bowl Id inherited from my grandmother. It was thick and nearly unbreakable: Id knocked it down many times during my childhood and it didnt have so much as a scratch on it. I poured myself a drink to clear my thoughts, and watched the night slowly drift away.

By the first rays of light, I had convinced myself to try again. This time, I drove to Mrs. Nicebuns workplace and waited near the entrance. I sat down on a bench with a cup of coffee in one hand and a newspaper in the other. When she finally showed up, I accidentally spilled my coffee, which made her slow her pace. My eyes darted towards her ID badge. Bingo! Allison Monroe. She took a little detour, gave me a sympathetic smile, and disappeared into the building. I returned home and looked her up online. Once Id found a hi-res photo of her, I brought it up to the laptops camera and attempted to sign in. Facial features not recognized. it said. Damn. A photo wouldnt do the trick.

Social media is a wonderful and terrible thing. Finding Allison on Facebook was easy, and shed brilliantly provided links to her Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest accounts. It wasnt hard to find out Allys likes and dislikes. She went out every Friday night to get drunk with her friends, she took baking classes on Sundays (with little to no success), and she loved taking photos of motherboards. Like, a TON of them. She fancied herself the artist, zooming in real close and applying a variety of filters. To be honest, her work looked pretty neat. She turned used computers into sci-fi-looking cityscapes. I came up with a fairly simple plan: Id approach her Friday night, charm the pants off of her, buy her a bunch of drinks, and point the laptop to her face once she was sufficiently out of it. Turns out, it was even easier than that. By the time I arrived at her favorite pub, she was already three sheets to the wind. I waited for her friends to take a washroom break, quickly pulled the laptop out of my bag, placed it on the bar, and told the drunken girl that we were taking a selfie. Eyes half shut, she lazily made a peace sign with her hands and grinned at the camera. Facial features not recognized. warned the computer, as I snatched it up and made my way towards the door. Crap, crap, crap. Her eyes must have been closed.

The moon was but a small sliver in the sky, and I watched it slowly make its way from rooftop to rooftop until the wee hours of the night. I waited for my little Ally to stagger out of the bar, and offered her a ride. She gleefully accepted and threw herself into the back seat. She probably thought I was a taxi driver. Oh, Ally. Sweet, nave Ally. I chuckled and drove back to my place. There was only one option left. I dragged her barely-conscious body inside and set her comfortably on the couch. I got tape and attempted to stick her eyelids open, but this made her agitated for some reason. She thrashed and screamed and caused a scene. I panicked: what if the neighbors heard?! I instinctively reached for the candy bowl on the living room table, sending Skittles hurling in all directions. They bounced and cascaded onto the floor like a colorful waterfall. In a swift motion, I knocked the bowl against Allys gentle head, intending only to calm her down. Blood gushed out of her skull like lava from an exploding volcano. I backed away in shock, slipped on the candy and fell to the floor. Everything went black.

By the time I came to, Ally was gone. I checked her pulse: her hands were cold and her skin had taken on an eerie blue sheen. Brownish stains of dried blood adorned the side of her head. My breath felt trapped in my throat and I had to swallow hard to get the air flowing into my lungs once more. My fingers stretched out towards her delicate face. I pried her eyelids open and, much to my surprise, they remained that way after I let go. She has such beautiful green eyes, not unlike the color of her precious motherboards. I lifted the laptop, convinced this time that the facial recognition software would be satisfied. Facial features not recognized. it said. Curses. I owed it to Ally to find out what was in there. What if she had other artsy photos to show the world?! It was my DUTY to open that laptop.

A thought crossed my mind, as I sat there desperately looking at my beautiful Allison: what if the facial recognition apparatus had some sort of heat-detection sensor? Yeah, that made sense. How else would it know the difference between a photo and a real person? I had no choice. I grabbed a knife from the kitchen, carved her lovely features off and removed her eyeballs carefully with a spoon. It pained me to do so, and the gushing sound almost made me ill. What was once a vibrant young woman now sat lifeless on my couch, her face in my hands like a stack of ham coated in chunky salsa.

I carefully brought Allys face to mine: it was cold, uncomfortable, and hindered my ability to breathe. I left it on for a few minutes, waiting for my body heat to transfer onto her flesh, while I held her eyeballs in my hands. Once I was convinced the face was warm enough, I skillfully peeled the forehead back and slipped the now warm eyes into its sockets, before pushing the skin back in place. I turned towards the laptop in a hurry. Facial features not recognized. it said. DAMN IT! I tossed the darn thing across the room out of frustration. It landed upside-down, and I spotted a label on its underbelly. I crawled over and looked at it. GOD DAMN IT, I am a MORON. Why hadnt I seen the label sooner?! Why hadnt I thought to check every inch of the laptop for clues!? What a horrible mistake! The label stated, in clear black letters: Steve Monroe. Urgh, I was going to have to start from scratch 




 One. Two. Three. Four. GOOSEBUMPS. 




 Theres someone outside my front door. Hes been standing there for hours. He knocked once, and then just stood there waiting. Hes at the door right now. I dont know what he wants. Hes not going away. I peeked through the window, but at my angle, I can barely make out a humanoid form. I think he has his face pressed against the peephole because, when I look through it, all I see is a dark beige mass. Im scared. Im so scared.

I was cooking supper when I heard the knock. It startled me to the point that I knocked a can of tomato juice over myself. Since I wasnt expecting any guests, I figured it was a solicitor of some sort. I started cleaning the mess, hoping hed give up and leave on his own. I cant believe the amount of tomato juice that can fit in a single can. My clothes weighed me down and I dragged the red liquid all the way to the bathroom, where I washed up and changed. Sporting a fresh pair of pajamas, I approached the living room window, convinced the front porch would be empty, and peered outside. The man was still at the door. I tapped the window lightly with my hand. I wasnt going to open the door unless I saw who it was first. The man did not react.

A familiar fizzling sound emerged from the kitchen. Oh, great, Id let the water boil over. I sprinted to the stove, trembling hand carefully navigating around foamy water and steam escaping from my pot, and quickly turned down the heat. The water sighed contently and dropped to the middle of its stainless steal nest. I threw fresh linguine into it and watched as they danced around like worms wriggling through the earth. Once the noodles were cooked, I served myself a plate and headed into the dining room. From the table, I watched my front door. Surely, the man had left by now, I thought. No one would wait outside a door for half an hour just to sell a magazine subscription. He had to know I wasnt interested in whatever stupid thing he had to sell. I ate my pasta, still feeling shaken by the creeper outside. No matter how often my wobbly hands dropped the fork, I managed to wolf down my meal. The spaghetti sauce was to die for.

After cleaning the dishes, I peered out the window again. He was still standing there! I went from thinking he was the worlds most annoyingly persistent door-to-door salesman, to realizing that his plans were of a far more sinister nature. Still, he hadnt made an effort to get inside, and I had locked the deadbolt, so I thought itd be okay to take a shower. My false sense of security did not last long. As soon as I got behind the shower curtain, I began to daydream about the man breaking the window and crawling into the bathroom to commit unspeakable atrocities to me. I felt naked. I mean, obviously I was naked because no one showers with his or her clothes onbut I felt naked INSIDE. I needed something to help me feel safe, so I ran to the kitchen, in the buff, and grabbed my sharpest cleaver. I nearly slipped on the way back, but I managed to steady myself. I placed the knife next to the shampoo, and finished showering with renewed confidence.

Clean as a whistle, I took a seat in the living room to watch some TV. The windows were distracting: they felt like giant magnifying glasses pointed directly at me. If I could see outside, then he could see inside. I rushed to flip the blinds shut, and spotted his form outside my door as I reached for the final pulley. This guy was going to kill me. I just knew it. I frantically shut the curtains and sat on my sofa, pulling a blanket over myself. Who could the man be? Why hadnt he knocked a second time? Why hadnt he rung the doorbell? In how many pieces would they find my body? Why hadnt he called out? The rush of fear made it hard to focus on the television screen. I flipped to the news, picturing the reporters solemn face as he explained how my quiet suburban home had been broken into and how I had been brutally maimed, my remains scattered throughout the house. They would call it a tragedy and would mourn the loss of someone so young and so full of promise. The thought brought tears to my eyes.

After an hour of contemplating my own mortality while watching M*A*S*H reruns, I had to use the restroom. I was afraid of leaving the living room because it meant having to walk by the front door. I ducked under the peepholes oppressive gaze and stealthily made my way to the cabinet, retrieving masking tape. I ripped off two pieces, placing one over the peephole and another over a hole in the middle of my door. Now, my assailant would be as blind as I was. I went to the washroom, took care of business, and walked by the door again. My nose caught whiff of a putrid smell: a wrestlers armpits mixed with half-off burrito night farts, and just a touch of rusted iron. How could I have been so careless?! I remembered Id felt a draft under my door a few days earlier and hadnt gotten around to applying sealant. The stranger outside could see me if he leaned down. I rushed to tape the bottom of the door. It was wet, so I had trouble getting the tape to stick, but after applying indiscriminate amounts of the stuff in zig-zaggy patterns, I finally managed to hide the crack.

I spent the rest of the evening nervously Googling kitten pictures. I wanted to get my mind off the man at the door. Anything to keep my brain from running through the horrific death montage. No amount of fluffy, adorable cuteness could penetrate my furiously beating heart. I could almost feel the strangers presence at my door. I know what I am saying is impossible, but it really felt as though I could see the outline of his body pressed against the surface, like a footprint on the snow. There was someone at my door, but it felt like he was inside. Another dozen minutes of absolute terror passed, and I had had enough. I grabbed the gun off the coffee table, tore the masking tape from the hole in the door, and placed the barrel inside. I examined the burnt wood around its circumference carefully. Id have to be careful not to get splinters when I repaired it. I hate splinters almost as much as I hate being brutally mutilated by a stranger at the door. I braced myself, and fired a shot. Theres someone at the door, and I dont think hes alive anymore. I better get a mop to clean up the tomato juice. I think I missed a spot. 




 How well do you pay attention to your list of recently opened documents? Last night, when tracking down a file I had worked on, I spotted an unfamiliar filename on the list: ryansjournal.docx. Privacy be dammed, I read it. I wish I hadnt. A whole day has gone by, and I still cannot shake the goose bumps: the content wasdisturbing, to say the least. Take a look:    

**Entry 1 - July 2nd, 2014:**

*My name is Ryan and Im 11 years old. Im writing this journal for a time capsule Im burying. Hi, older me! Hope you made it as a firefighter!*

*Me and mom moved this week. Theres a lot of boxes everywhere. I dont like it here. Its really small. I miss my big backyard with the pool and all the oak trees. I used to climb them and pretend I was king of the forest. There are no trees here. Just a fence and a bit of grass. I hate it. I dont know anyone here. The worst is that its REALLY creepy at night. The shadows in my room look like theyre about to reach out and grab me. Im too old for a nightlight so I snuck a flashlight under my pillow so mom wont ask questions.*

My intention in moving was simple: shorten my commute to work and lower my bills. I was wasting so much money heating up an entire house, when a two-bedroom apartment did the job. The apartment is in the basement, so it requires less AC in the summer and less heating in the winter. As an added bonus, the place is pitch black at night. The master bedroom in my old house overlooked a street lamp. Not even the blackest of curtains could keep the light from shining in and, as a result, I had trouble falling asleep. I sleep like a baby in this apartment.

**Entry 2  July 16th, 2014:**

*Mom finished unpacking. She must have forgotten a few boxes, because I dont have any toys to play with. I still dont have any friends because mom wont let me go to the park. She said Ill make new friends when school starts. I think shes just too lazy to show me the way to the park. This sucks! I hate it here! I hate HER! Shes the WORST! I wish I had someone to talk to! I want to go home! Every night, the shadows get closer and closer to my bed and I scare them away with my flashlight. Im afraid the batteries will die.*

**Entry 3  July 30th, 2014:**

*Today, I made a new friend!!! His name is Deacon and he lives in my closet behind a super-secret door Im not supposed to tell mom about. Hes really fun. His favorite color is green, just like me! I hope me and Deacon will be friends forever. He likes all the same food as me and plays all the same games! Hes older and a little scary-looking, but I dont mind. Hes fun! He even told me he could protect me from the shadows at night.*

**Entry 4  August 13th, 2014:**

*I asked mom if Deacon could have supper with us tonight, but she ignored me. She was on her computer again, looking at weird symbols all evening. I grabbed an extra plate of food after supper and took it to my room for Deacon. He loved the ground beef but didnt touch the peas. I cant blame him. Peas are gross!*

I work as a Web Developer at a University, and August is our busiest time of the year. Its not unusual for me to have to do a bit of overtime in the weeks leading up to the start of the Fall semester. I suppose HTML code can look a lot like weird symbols to the untrained eye. I can read HTML like you would read a book. Its like my mind automatically renders the tags into their intended format. I suppose to others, it must be as foreign as sheet music is to me: I do not understand it and all I see are a bunch of dots on a half-dozen lines.

**Entry 5  August 27th, 2014:**

*Mom still wont let me invite Deacon for supper, so I have to sneak food to him every night. She keeps telling me Deacon isnt real. She says Im too old to have an imaginary friend. I told her to go suck a turdsicle. She didnt like that. I was sent to my room. Grrr. I hate her. Deacon is real! Hes my best friend! He even crawls into bed with me at night to protect me from the scary shadows in the room. He holds me so tight that I cant move sometimes. He says as long as were together were safe. I believe him. I see the shadows scurrying away and up the wall whenever he crawls over.*

**Entry 6  September 24th, 2014:**

*Sorry I didnt write for a while. I started school and had SO MUCH homework. Mom wont let me on the computer unless Im done. 5th graders get a LOT of homework. By the time Im done, moms on her stupid websites and wont let me have my turn. Why cant we have two computers like a normal family?!!??!?! At least I have Deacon to talk to. Mom doesnt like it when she hears us talk. She says its not healthy to talk to myself. Shes a triple-stupid dumb-shake with a cherry on top! If shed just let him eat with us, shed see hes real.*

A crudely drawn [MS Paint doodle](http://i57.tinypic.com/2n8vcyx.jpg) was included with this entry. On it, I can make out Ryan with a tall, dark figure looming over him, holding his shoulders. The man has long, claw-like fingers, big dark holes for eyes, and a large gaping smiling mouth with sharp fangs. He seems to be looking at my cat, who is cowering in the corner of the room.

**Entry 7  October 8th, 2014:**    

*Deacon isnt happy. Mom found his hiding spot. She got rid of all his stuff!!! Hes hiding in the ceiling now. Theres a little crawl space where the air conditioner goes. Hes in there right now. I can hear him grunting. Hes so upset. Mom needs to apologize if she knows whats good for her.*    

I did find a little door in the walk-in closet. I opened it up and got a face full of dust. There were a few boxes of trinkets, which I assumed belonged to the apartments previous owners. I tossed them out. Who needs old rags, magazines, and worn shoes? I found the small storage space after hearing skittering noises in the walls. I wasnt sure if mice had gotten in, or if the apartment was crackling from the cold outside. I never dreamed I would find the perfect place to store winter apparel. I cleaned it up and filled it with coats and boots.    
 

**Entry 8  October 22nd, 2014:**

*Deacon couldnt come and protect me last night because mom left my bedroom door open. He said he doesnt want her to see us together. She might make him go away if she saw him and the shadows. I was so scared. I cried myself to sleep. I needed his big strong arms to protect me. I woke up in the middle of the night and saw shadows crawling towards me. They lifted from the floor and made squishy noises like they were made of slime putty. I screamed for my mom but she didnt come. One of the shadows got on the bed and I felt it crawling towards me. Threw my flashlight at it. It must have landed on the switch, because it lit up and the shadows disappeared under the bed.*

I remember keeping the door open because the room smelled awful and desperately needed to be aired out. I always keep the door shut so at least one room is devoid of cat fur. I would have opened the window instead of the door, but it has been stuck since the move and no amount of force has managed to pry it loose. I had no choice but to leave the door open all day and overnight. I was pleasantly surprised that the cat did not even try to step foot inside.

**Entry 9  November 5th, 2014:**

*Mom has been keeping my door open. Deacon is getting really angry with her. He says hes going to have to deal with her soon. I warned her Deacon was getting mad, but shes still insisting Deacon isnt real. Stupid stupid stupid. Deacon is watching.*

That entry is the last one in the journal. If that wasnt creepy enoughheres the really weird thing: Im single and I live alone with my cat. I do not nor have I ever- had a child. I dont know what to say: maybe its a bad prank, but I checked the file properties and it was created in July and last updated on November 5th. I havent had houseguests since late October. My computer is not synched up to any device, nor does it have the capability to do so.

I noticed the entries are typically written every other Wednesday, so I am curious to see if there will be a new one tomorrow. If there is, I will give you guys an update.

**Update (November 19th, 2014):** I barely slept last night. I decided to check the journal before I went to work. I dont even know what to say. To say that I am horrified is putting it lightly. Here is the entry:

**Entry 10  November 19th, 2014:**

*Deacon is real and hes coming for you. Deacon is real and hes coming for you. Deacon is real and hes coming for youunless the shadows get you first.*

I think I am going to stay at a motel tonight.

**Update (November 24th, 2014):** I just wanted to give you guys an update. I think I am freaking myself out over nothing. Ever since I read the journal, I keep seeing things move around in the dead of night. Around 3:00 a.m. this morning, I got up to use the restroom and saw my cat standing in the kitchen. He walked towards his food bowl and I heard a familiar crunching sound. I left him alone and went back to bed. As I slipped under the covers, my foot grazed my cat's head and he gave me an insulted, half-asleep meowl. There's no way he ran past me from the kitchen into my room: the hallway is too narrow. I would have seen or felt him. I was probably just sleep-deprived and imagined seeing him in the kitchen.

People asked to see the drawing I found in Ryan's journal. It has been uploaded: [Ryan's Drawing](http://i57.tinypic.com/2n8vcyx.jpg) 




 I recommend making asking them to make a deal. Have you ever wanted to be famous? Now's the time to promise your first unborn son (or daughter) for your 15 minutes of fame! : ) Do not try to get your original child back. Allowing themselves to become possessed so easily is a sign of weakness. 




 You nearly made me spit out my water! XD 




 Actually, I do. My college buddy used to work at Canadian Tire. Next time he's in town, I'll ask him to check it out. Thanks for the suggestion! 




 I found the one I was talking about: it belonged to James Dean. If you look it up, the name of the car was 'Little Bastard'. Other people bought parts from that car and, well, it did not end well.

As for my parts, I have absolutely no idea how to check. I'm not a big driver. I just use my car to do groceries. My mechanical knowledge extends to noticing the oil change sticker expiration date and driving the  car to a garage. 




 At my dentist, there are two other people who share my name, one of which has the same date of birth as me. I always have to give the clerk my full address when booking appointments because of it. You're making me wonder if we all have future selves out there, trying to come into contact with us. 




 I think I know what you're talking about. The race car that some dude died in, and then its pieces wound up in other cars and it all of those cars ended up in really bad accidents? Maybe my car's not haunted. Maybe it's one of its replacement parts. Haunted muffler? 




 xD; It's not the most badass and newest of cars, but it gets the job done.

Before you ask, it plays CDs, not cassette tapes. 




 I'm due for a new car soon anyway. Spent so much cash on repairs this past year. The muffler, the battery, the engine. X_x; 




 Hey guys. I have an honest-to-goodness question for yall. Can cars become haunted? Ive seen some really weird stuff in my car. This isnt a scary story, for the record: this is 100% for real, and it has been happening for the past couple of years.

I drive a 10-year-old red Toyota Corolla (a bitchin color, if I do say so myself). Im its second owner, the first owners being my parents. I bought it off of them last year when they retired and decided to ditch their house and car in favor of their truck and trailer. Point being: this isnt some used, refurbished car I got off of Craigslist after it killed a bunch of innocent kids in a horrible traffic incident. I mean, it has had a few bumps and bruises along the way. My sister once told us that car insurance companies charge higher rates for red cars because they tend to be involved in traffic accidents more often. For the record, this is not true. The color of your car does not affect insurance rates. Despite the fact that my sisters claim was wrong, I cant deny that the car has gotten in a lot of minor accidents, compared to the other cars my parents drove over the years. Accident/bump/scrape count on all other cars combined over the course of about 20 years: 0. Accident/bump/scrape count on the Corolla: about 5.

Itd be easy to blame the accidents on the fact that the Corolla was driven by two new drivers (my sister and I), as well as my parentsbut my sister never hit anything and I only scratched it once. I felt absolutely awful about it, though. It was one of my first times taking it out and I was backing out of a grocery store parking lot. My bumper scraped another cars bumper. Juuuust enough for a little dirt to transfer from one car to the other. I freaked out and waited for the cars drivers. They just laughed, thanked me for waiting, and left without taking down my information. It was so small and insignificant, but to this day I park at the far end of parking lots and walk the rest of the way. Every other incident occurred while one of my parents was behind the wheel. Mom once backed up into a cement post, my dad got rear-ended by a truck and ended up hitting one of those trailer balls on the car in front of him (theres still a hole-shaped mark in our front bumper, makes it easy to spot my car!), and at some point someone crashed into the side of the vehicle. There are also unexplained scratches on the car. Like, someone TRYING to key it but not using an instrument sharp enough to do the trick. No injuries, no deaths. Definitely nothing that qualifies as a reason for a car to be haunted.

I remember one day my dad, sister, and I were driving to the library. I saw an old man get on the road as we were passing. My eyes widened and my heart came to a halt when I realized my father was not stopping the car. I nearly shouted, fully expecting to hear a THUD at any moment. Nothing happened. I looked back but there was no one on the street. Didnt you see that guy? I asked my father and sister. Neither of them had a clue what I was talking about. Ghost pedestrian? Who the fuck knows.

What really spooks me is what Ive been seeing IN the car since then. Back in our old house, the kitchen overlooked a living room with large bay windows pointed straight at the driveway. Every now and then, Id turn around and see someones figure in the drivers seat. Im not talking about a creepy shadow in the night, either. I meanI was doing the dishes after making lunch and thered be a silhouette in there. It didnt disappear when I blinked. Id usually get distracted for a moment and look again, only to find the car was empty. This happened ALL the time. At least twice a month. One night, I was driving back home and I looked in the rearview mirror. Yknow in those horror movies when you see a figure in the mirror? Holy shit, it happened. I very VERY clearly saw a man sitting in the back seat. I turned my head but of course there was nothing there.

I recently moved and the car cannot be seen from any of my windows. I see the car when I get out of the bus and when I take out the trash. When I do, often times, Ill see a figure in there. Heck, just last week I went to the grocery store and, on my way back to the car, I got this weird feeling. I looked up and there was someone in the drivers seat. It doesnt matter what angle the cars in, either. Ive seen the silhouette straight-on, from the back, and from the side. So what do you think? Can cars become haunted? Is MY car haunted? How the heck does a car even get haunted???

Update (Nov 15th 2014): I spotted a footprint facing my car in a patch of snow outside this morning. I know it's not mine: I only take the car out on weekends to run errands. Haven't been near it since last Saturday. Maybe one of the neighbours got nosy. 




 Brilliantly written. I love the slow descent into instability! 




 Do you think its still alive?! shrieked Courtney, mere seconds after impact. She regained control of the car and came to a complete stop. I looked out the window, towards a dark mass spread out on the road. IuhI dont know. I replied, gathering myself. My neck felt stiff from the whiplash caused by her sudden stop. Courtney hid her face against the steering wheel. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god! she groaned. Babe, relax. Its not the first time youve hit something, and it probably wont be the last. Remember when you backed up over my foot? I replied cheerfully, trying to lighten her spirits. OH MY GOD, STEPHEN. When are you going to let that GO!? she shouted at me, jabbing me sharply in the side with her elbow. There were times when Courtney praised my sense of humor. This was not one of those times.

It happened in early November several years ago. It was the first snow of the season and we were caught off guard, having not changed to our winter tires on yet. The road was slippery, but Courtney was doing a good job navigating the winding roads back from our campground, where we had spent our anniversary. It had been a nice, clothing-optional weekend, away from the hustle and bustle of our suburban lives. We were driving through a heavily forested area when we spotted something up ahead. We barely had time to register those big doe eyes, before we were already on top of it. Courtney tried to stop, but the tires slipped on a patch of slush and caught the poor thing with the corner of the car. I guess reindeers arent the only woodland creatures that can fly!
 
Maaaan, Bambis going to have a pretty shitty family reunion. I chirped playfully. I felt another jab from Courtneys adamantium elbows. STOP FUCKING AROUND AND GO CHECK ON IT! she screamed. I tried to tell her it was best to call the authorities. Approaching a wounded animal is never a good idea. I could picture myself getting kicked by the thing. My ribs had gotten enough abuse for one night, thank you very much. Youd be surprised how hard someone as small as Courtney can ram an elbow into you. She shoved a flashlight in my hand and pointed out the window. It might still be alive! Go help it! she insisted. I sighed and relented.

I stepped out of the car and carefully made my way around, checking for damage. The headlights were still functioning, and the impact had only caused a reasonably small bump. Ive seen pictures of cars nearly totalled after hitting a deer. I figured we got really lucky. Satisfied with my inspection, I turned around to check out the deer, but I slipped on some ice and disappeared from view. Courtney rolled down her window and shouted: ARE YOU OKAY!? Never missing an opportunity to be an insufferable asshole, I started screaming my ass off. ITS GOT ME!! OH GOD ITS GOD ME!! IT HAS FANGS!!! I shouted, smacking my hand against the car door. I started laughing hysterically and pulled myself back to my feet. Courtney had the look on her face. If youve ever had a girlfriend, you know exactly what Im talking about. I threw my hands into the air and backed away from the car. I know, I know: stop being an asshole, check on the deer. I said, before she had the chance to scold me.

I approached the creature cautiously and slowly. I remember being really surprised by how little blood I saw. Having never hit anything more sentient than a trash can, I assumed there would be a fountain of blood gushing out or something. After another few steps, the flashlight died. Its kind of cool how, during the darkest time of the year, the ground gets covered in a substance that reflects even the smallest of light. The moonlit snow provided enough light to forget about the extra batteries I had in the trunk. DO YOU THINK ITS STILL ALIVE!? Courtney shouted from the car. I sighed and rolled my eyes: Jesus Christ, Court. Give me a fuckin minute. I barked back. The cold was getting me grumpy. I rubbed my unprotected hands together and watched my breath escape my lips and dissipate into the air.

The creature wasnt moving. At least, not from what I could tell. From a distance, I could see weird streaks across its body. With every step I took, I got the feeling something wasnt right with it. Its front legs lay completely flat on the ground as though devoid of bones while its hind legs looked bloated. I finally reached it and knelt down. Those werent marks on its flesh: they were stitches. Courtney waited silently, providing me with no sound but that of the engine calmly purring away. I secretly wished she would beckon me back to the car. I hesitantly reached for the does head and turned it lightly. I nearly pissed myself. Its eyes were open and looking straight at me. I was so spooked that I dropped the head. It made a strange clunking sound when it hit the concrete. I realized in that moment that the eyes werent real. They were fucking glass eyes.

I wanted to run the fuck back to the car, but curiosity got the better of me. As though in a trance, I traced my hands along the many stitches. It became clear, judging by the variety of colors on the does body, that I was looking at more than one animal crudely sewn together. I shuffled to the other side of the creature and actually screamed, falling on my ass. It was a man. A FUCKING MAN. He was sticking out of the Frankenbambi, wearing it like some sick ass costume. From what I could see, he appeared to be completely nude. Moonlight reflected off of something near his left hand: it was a sharp-looking hunting knife. The fingers of his right hand were still tightly clutched around a handgun. The mans blood slowly soaked into the suit hed made himself. Stomach twisting, I bolted back towards the car and got into the passengers seat. I knew. He wasnt some weird pervert. He wasnt the worlds weirdest method actor. He wasnt trying to blend in with the deer. He meant to stop us on the road. I just knew. I just fucking knew. He meant to stop us and to kill usor worse.

Courtney shook me, Sowas it still alive? she asked me, apparently ignoring the absolute horror in my eyes. She seemed to have cheered up at least. I shook my head slowly, placing a hand on my chest. no. Drive. Just drive. I told her. She let out a little whimper, and then drove off. I didnt want to tell her what I saw. Some things are better left unsaid. The next day, I called the authorities to let them know we saw a dead deer on the road. I figured theyd think I was just an oblivious Good Samaritan reporting a road hazard. They bought it. Until now, Ive never told anyone the truth about the doe. What really creeps me out is that there were no reports of mysterious deaths in the media. When I think back to that night, Imnot entirely surebutI looked back in the rear-view mirror as we drove offand I think I saw it move. He might still be out there 




 Eeeeeeeeee, way to send a chill down my spine! Oh, crazy 'ol aunt Ruth. 




 Y'know what? If I get my hands on a tank, I'll go and let ya'll know how it went. 




 One had the flu and the other said she didn't have a ride. They bail on me ALL the time, so I'm not surprised. 




 Most of you would probably agree that high school isnt nearly as awesome as TV shows make it out to be. These are the best years of your life! parents often say. What a load of crock. Its no surprise, then, that when I received an invitation to attend my 10-year high school reunion, my reaction wasnt so much YAY!!!, but rather, Yeaaaah, no. I crumbled up the invitation into a neat little ball, which I promptly threw into my overflowing recycling bin. I had been bullied a lot in high school, and the last thing I wanted was to talk to those people again. It was only after relentless nagging from my friends that I reluctantly agreed to go. I wish I hadnt. The night of my 10-year highschool reunion was the weirdest and scariest of my life.


I sat in the parking lot, waiting for my overzealous friends to show up. They promised me we didnt have to socialize, and that the three of us would just hang out all night and check things out. I looked at my phone. They were late, and had not left me any messages. I shifted about in my seat, tugging at my extremely uncomfortable dress. I had been forced to buy it for the reunion, which just added to my frustration. Ive never been at ease in a dress. Wearing one just feels unnatural to me, like Im galloping around in a clown outfit. I sent my friends a text message, while idly eyeing the banner above the main doors. Welcome Class of 2000!!! it said, in big, bold letters. I could hear music blaring from the agora. It started to get a little chilly, so I headed into the school. My friends had not replied.


Annoyed and wanting to go home, I grabbed my nametag off the table and pinned it to my dress strap. I followed the horrendous sound of techno music and found my way into the cafeteria, which opened up to our schools large agora. On the stage, huge speakers throbbed and vomited the sorry excuse for music into a dancing crowd. There were oceans of balloons and streamers hanging from the ceiling. I glanced towards the table of refreshments. A group of at least thirty people stood in front of it, obscuring my view of the punch bowl. There was something off about the whole scene, but I couldnt quite put my finger on it.


I scanned the room and realized something: I didnt know most of these people. At first, I figured they were my classmates significant others, but upon further inspection, I realized they outnumbered the familiar faces 3 to 1. I checked my phone again. Neither of my friends had contacted me. Figures, they bailed on meAGAIN. I was fumbling, trying to get my phone back into the cheap purse I had bought for the occasion, when someone bumped into me. I recognized her immediately, and my stomach dropped. It was Marie-Claude, my main tormentor. I was sure her dead-beat ass wouldnt show up here. I was wrong. She gave me a weird look and spoke: Hi. Its nice to see you again she began, then paused to look at my name tag, Caroline. she finished. I forced a smile and nodded: Yeah, uh. You too. I answered, feeling nauseous. This skank tortured me for five years, and her cordial attitude didnt sit well with me. I wasnt that surprised that she forgot my name: I couldnt recall the name of most of my classmates. I remembered their faces, though, so theres that. I excused myself and walked off.


In a quick pace, I walked towards the refreshments. People were still swarming around it like fruit flies on a rotten apple. Strange thing is, I could have sworn it was the exact same people as before. One of the many strangers roaming the cafeteria approached me. Hi. Its nice to see you againCaroline. he said, using the exact same tone and inflection that Marie-Claude had used earlier, and checking my name tag just like she had done. I dont think I know you I replied, taking a step away. His vacant stare suggested hed had too much to drink. I turned on my heels and walked right into another stranger. Hi. Its nice to see you againCaroline. she said as well. By then, I was thoroughly crept out. Things were getting too weird for comfort. I scurried off to the side, trying to gather myself, but everyone I came across said the exact same thing. Was this some kind of elaborate prank?


Techno music continued to play non-stop. I stared at my cell phone, pretending I was doing something so I could avoid having to socialize further. It took me a good ten minutes to look up again. It wasnt my imagination: the group around the punch bowl hadnt budged. I slowly shifted my gaze towards the agora to get a better look at the dancers. Upon closer inspection, I realized they werent so much dancing as they were thrashing about, repeating the same motion over and over again, like moths banging themselves against a window to get to the light inside. Have you ever looked at the audience in sport videogames? To give the illusion of a living crowd, the audience is given a set of 2-3 reoccurring moves, which they randomly cycle through. Thats exactly what the dancers looked like to me. My focus then changed to the music. I may be a little bias here, because I dont like techno, but I could have sworn the song hadnt changed since my arrival. It was just looping the same noises with frustrating repetition. It was giving me one hell of a headache.


I walked into the washroom, feeling an immediate sense of relief. The thick concrete wall shielded me from the assaulting music outside. I smiled as I spotted the sink: it protruded from the wall in a large semi-circle, around which you could fit at least five people. A step pedal underneath allowed the user to activate two dozen small streams of water. I always liked this sink. It was user-friendly and reminded me of a fountain. I pushed down on the pedal and splashed water onto my face. So refreshing. It was then that I heard the bathroom door slowly squeaking open. I instinctively retracted into one of the stalls and locked it. I remembered this stall. The crack on the wall, the chip in the floor tile, the profanities carved into the separators. I had spent almost all my breaks hiding in that very stall. Technically, there was no reason to hide now. Someone wanted to use the washroomnothing weird there. For some reason; however, I felt an enormous amount of dread. I could hear the girls footsteps as she entered the room. I knoooow youre heeereeeee. she uttered, in a sing-song voice. My jaw dropped and I nearly screamed. I slapped my hands to my mouth to keep myself silent. The skin of my arms formed a mountain range for the microbes living on them. I held my breath, slowly climbed onto the toilet seat, and crouched. My stupid dress made it hard to stay balanced atop the porcelain throne, so I used an arm to steady myself and hoped that I would go undetected. I didnt want her to find me. I didnt know what would happen if she did. I saw her through the cracks in the stalls door. She was leaning down, trying to find my feet. My heart thumped heard. I hoped she couldnt hear it beating. Shit, shit, shit. After a few moments, she turned around and headed back to the party. I finally exhaled and shakily planted my feet back on the floor.


I waited a couple of minutes and then snuck out through washrooms other door. I was half-expecting her to be standing outside, but was relieved when I walked out to an empty hallway. I headed towards the agora. I was sure now: the music hadnt changed. Same people at the refreshment table. Same weird dancing. Just when I thought things couldnt get any scarier, shit got real. The dancing stopped. Everyones heads twisted slowly and mechanically towards me, in unison. They were wearing eerie, crooked smiles. My stomach dropped and my heart nearly stopped. I turned to the cafeteria, and the punchbowl crowd starred at me with the same unearthly grin and vacant eyes. Shit, Id had enough. I ran out of there like a bat out of hell, my legs spreading out so far that my dress ripped. I didnt stop until I reached my car, and then I sped home, going right through a red light. Honestly, I think I would have been relieved if cops had caught me, because at least then I could tell someone to go check out the high school.


Hands trembling, I opened the door to my apartment and locked it behind me, ripping the dress from my sweaty body. I could barely catch my breath. Again, I wondered if it was some kind of horrible prank. Maybe all my bullies had gotten together for one final hoorah? Nothere were too many people involved. Too many moving parts. NO ONE would go through THAT much trouble to freak out someone they hadnt seen or spoken to in 10 years, right? God damn, it was scary as shit. I still have nightmares about that night. If it was a prank, mission fucking accomplished. Its been almost 5 years and I still get rattled just thinking about it.


Today, in the mail, I received a Save The Date! for the 15-year reunion coming up this spring. Oh hell no. You better believe I ripped that bitch up. I am NOT going, and no amount of nagging from my friends will convince me otherwise. 




 Thanks, I'm glad you liked it. : )

It was my bad. Suspension of disbelief and all that. Haunted, talking walls are unfortunately not believable. 




 Oh, goodness. This was absolutely wonderful. Cudos to you! 




 They found the body. It was real.
 
Last night, I took my friend Todd out to a midnight showing of Nightmare on Elm Street at the theatre. Todd had been bummed out after spraining his ankle just in time to miss the annual 10k Halloween Zombie marathon. Hed been training for months and had prepared an awesome costume. He even bought finger-shaped gummy candy to shove into his mouth during the run. You know, for realism. He kept joking that hed eat the other marathon runners if he ran out of candy. I argued that his constant limping would actually make his costume more realistic, and that he should go anyways, but he refused, claiming that he wanted to avoid irritating the injury. Todd had always had a competitive streak. When we were younger, he would race me to the swing sets, jump on the couch to distract me while we were playing Mario Kart, and drag me kicking and screaming off of our makeshift wrestling ring made out of sofa pillows. Though Todd wouldnt admit it, I knew he was sitting the marathon out to avoid being the last one to cross the finish line.
 
Bellies weighed down with two tons of popcorn and Halloween chocolate, we started our slow walk home. Mr. Tough-guy acted like he was fine, but I saw him wincing every time his right foot made contact with the ground. Hey. I said, breaking the silence that had followed us since the theatre, I know a shortcut to your placeif youre not too chicken shit to take it. I proposed. Todd puffed his chest out and chuckled loudly: Youre on, dog-breath. Dont come cryin to me like a little wuss if you get scared. he replied, looking quite proud of his comeback. Adulthood had made us wiser, but certainly not more mature. I turned a corner and lead Todd down the shortcut I had only taken a couple of times before. A cold wind blew through the deserted street. Trick-or-treaters had long since returned home and fallen into diabetic comas from all the sugar. My Halloween coma was going to start the next day, once I bought leftover candy from the store for a fraction of the cost.
 
I grinned as we passed a parked car. What the heck. I said. Todd quirked a brow and turned his head towards me. What? he replied, confused. The license plate. I answered, motioning to the car. It had the typical three-digit, three-letter format, and its three letters read W-T-H. Its a game. You have to make words or acronyms out of the letters. I explained. Todd seemed intrigued. He glanced at another car. OK. I think I got it. So, like, over thereDBT. To Be Determined, if youre dyslexic! he said. A chuckle escaped my lips. I gave him a thumbs-up, I like that. OK, lets seeover there, weve got SPK: Spooky? I continued. We both started laughing when we spotted one that read SMB. We kept this up for a good ten minutes, listing out words and acronyms for every car we spotted. We got stumped when we came across XLS, until Todd proudly claimed it was Excels file format. Shit, I should have taught him this game sooner.
 
We turned another corner, only to come face-to-face with a roadblock. Construction crews all over the city were struggling to finish their work before the freeze. Travel had gotten difficult for pedestrians. To get to work that morning, I had to take FIVE freaking detours. Fortunately, I spotted a bike path through a small forest on our left. I had a vague recollection of seeing a path near Todds house, so I figured wed get there eventually if we took it. I didnt have the heart to tell Todd we had to double-back and make him walk on that ankle of his, so I trudged onward, acting like I meant for us to go there. I spotted an unmarked black van just outside the entrance, and nudged Todd to look at it: Check out surveillance van #6. You didnt tell me the FBI was watching your neighborhood! I joked. He stuck his tongue out at me and replied: Theyre here to monitor YOU, bud. After a good laugh, we wandered into the path.
 
We were surrounded by trees, which were being eaten away slowly by the frigid autumn air. Small clusters of brown and yellow leafs still clutched to the menacing-looking branches above us. In the darkness of the night, they looked like hundreds of bats waiting to descend onto us. Thats when we saw him: a hooded man standing no less than 20 meters in front of us, a shovel in one hand and a bulky pillowcase in the other. He seemed to have come out of nowhere. At first, I mistook him for a lost trick-or-treater, but I soon realized he was far too old and what I thought was a bag full of candy had an eerie shape and dripped an unknown liquid onto the leaf-covered ground beneath it. For a moment, time seemed suspended. Neither Todd, the stranger, nor I made a single move. If not for the thrashing sensation of my heart beating against my chest, I would have thought we were in a movie that someone had paused. My eyes slowly trailed towards a pile of dirt just next to the gravel road, and then to the large hole in its shadow. My mind was racing. Every inch of me wanted to run. There was something so unnatural about the scene. It was as though the air itself had become tangible and heavy. So very heavy. Todd looked as white as a ghost. I think he was coming to the same conclusion as me, though neither one of us dared say it out loud. The hooded figure, covered in dirt, suddenly dropped the pillowcase. It hit the ground with an unnerving THUD. Something rolled out of it. I couldnt make out what it was at first. It was furry and damp. As it continued to roll, I realized what I was looking at: a head. Holy fucking shit. It was a womans head. Her lightless eyes lay open, starring right into my soul. A length of her spine dangled from what was left of her neck. Her hair was soaked in blood and flesh had gotten tangled into her locks. Adrenaline surged through my veins. We had to run. I looked at Todd, hoping to see the face of a man ready to escape. Instead, I saw a scared boy frozen in place. We couldnt stay there. We were going to get killed if we didnt run. A shameful thought crossed my mind, and even now I struggle to admit it: I thought of leaving Todd behind. He was in no condition to run. He would only slow me down. Maybe, just maybe, if I left him there, Id survive. My body trembled violently. The adrenaline was making it hard to decide between fight and flight. The stranger made the decision for me. Shovel in-hand, he bolted towards us.
 
I grabbed Todd violently by the arm: SHIT, TODD, RUN!! I screamed, hoping to all hope that I could pull him out of his stupor. I didnt care how badly his ankle hurt. I yanked him back and he finally responded. OH SHIT OH SHIT OH SHIT! screamed Todd. We started running back down the way we came. Todd was too slow, and the crazed, decapitating madman gained on us. To make matters worse, he waslaughing? I could picture Todd and I getting brutally cut up into pieces by a chainsaw as this guy laughed and laughed over our mangled remains. ITS A PRANK! howled the man behind us. He dropped the shovel and waved his arms in the air, Its for Youtube! he screamed louder. Todd and I slowed down. My cheeks flushed red as we came to a stop. I cupped my hands to my knees and inhaled deeply. W-what? I mumbled. The stranger laughed louder and pulled down his hood. He was a fairly normal-looking Caucasian male in his thirties. He pointed towards the wooded area. Were filming a Halloween prank. Oh man, you should have seen your faces. he said. My head was spinning, playing catch-up quite inefficiently. Todd began laughing hard: Shit, oh my GOSH! You got us GOOD, man. he replied, heaving a sigh of relief. I was still too rattled to comment. I genuinely thought I was going to dieall for a stupid Youtube video.
 
It took me a few minutes to compose myself. The prankster introduced himself with his Youtube handle, which I regrettably cannot remember. He asked for permission to use our reactions, and Todd enthusiastically agreed, while I gave a nonchalant, consensual wave. He smiled broadly, Great, were going to need you to sign a consent form. I didnt print enough, so Ill just mail it to you guys. Where do you live? he asked, in a friendly tone. Todd answered immediately. I wasnt quite as eager: Im from out of townIm staying over at his place. I lied. Todd understood. Ive never been big on sharing personal information with strangers. I usually glare and refuse to give out my postal code to cashiers when they ask me. Why the fuck do they need that information, anyways? Im buying something from their stupid store and I just want to go home. Stop asking. In any case, the stranger jotted down Todds address, and we were left to our own devices.
 
We continued down the bike path and stopped near the hole. Todd playfully prodded the severed head with his fingertips. Hahaha. Cool. It feels so real. he told me. I refused to touch the prop. The rest of the way, Todd chirped and laughed about how we were going to be Youtube stars, teasing me about how frightened I looked earlier. I, on the other hand, couldnt shake the feeling that something was wrong, and added very little to the conversation. The prankster kept saying we, and motioning to the trees, as though someone was filming in there. We spoke with the guy for a good twenty minutes but his buddy never came out. I never actually saw the camera, nor did I feel another persons presence there with us. I shrugged it off as nerves. Todd and I parted ways and I headed home, feeling silly about how freaking scared I was. It took me a while to fall asleep, but eventually exhaustion won out.
 
This morning, I woke up, turned on the TV, and started making breakfast. Just as I began to butter my toast, the screen turned red and BREAKING NEWS scrolled on the bottom of the frame. Police had unearthed the severed remains of a woman in a shallow grave on the bike path. Her torso and legs were found in an unmarked van not far away, along with an unidentified mans arm. Oh shit. Since then, Ive been ringing Todd up on the phone. Hes not answering. Ive texted him. Ive emailed him. I made a stupid Twitter account so I could tweet him. No answer. Why isnt Todd answering!? 




 My name is Nathan, and I am being held against my will.

I dont know how long Ive been here, but it feels like months. My prison is dark and I cannot see anything. From time to time, I hear sounds from the outside world. They are distorted and muffled, but I can make out my captors voices just enough to notice an eerily gleeful tone. The distant sounds of music also make their way into my ears. My captors play classical music all the time. Classical motherfucking music. I cant stand to hear it. Im trapped here and theyre forcing me to listen to fucking Mozart. I want to go home to my wife and daughter. Will I ever see them again? I smash my arms and legs against the walls of my cell; they are met with a spongy surface coated in nauseatingly squishy mucus. I guess not being able to see has its advantages. Im terrified of knowing what these walls are made of.

The last thing I remember before waking up is going to a take-out restaurant to pick up a meal for my family. My wife asked me to have it delivered since it was raining so hard, but I insisted on going. The food is warmer when I go get it myself. Delivery boys always seem to stop by our house at the end of their route, and I didnt feel like having another lukewarm meal. I grabbed my keys and ran out the door, jokingly promising Id be back home in time for supper. After picking up our meal, I headed back towards my house. The rain wasnt letting up at all. My wipers could barely handle the load. I knew Id be home soon so I kept going at the same speed. It was a terrible mistake. I watched as a car on the opposing lane flew through a puddle and rammed me straight off the road. Clutching the steering wheel tightly, I tried to regain control of my vehicle. The image of the tree I hit is still burned into my retinas. I cannot recall anything after that.

Ive been in this cell for so long, I barely remember how to talk. Im so lonely. My little Sophia will be turning 7 soon. Orhas she already turned 7? Its hard to tell time anymore. I used to count the days, but after they turned into months, I lost track. I want to go home. I want to hold my wife and kids in my arms and tell them I love them. Im not a perfect man by any means, but what did I ever do to deserve this? What did my FAMILY ever do to deserve this? I want to sit around our old kitchen table, with its crayon stains and chipped corners. As my thoughts continue to drift, I suddenly realize its getting harder to breathe. Theres something around my neck. My emaciated arms reach up to try and pull it off, but I havent the strength to do so. Maybe its better this way. My family must have moved on by now. I welcome the sweet relief of death.


With freedom at my fingertips, I feel a large hand reaching for me and pulling me out of my prison. NO! You son of a bitch! I was ready to die, damn it! Its too bright to see anything, so I keep my eyes closed. I can barely breathe. I cant move at all. I feel the hand slapping me firmly on the back, dislodging a chunk of mucus from my throat. I must have swallowed it when he was pulling me out. I cry out for my family. I scream and scream, begging for them to take me home. They dont listen to me. I hear them laughing. The man holding me speaks out: Its a boy! he says. No shit, Sherlock. What the fuck did you expect?! Did you think my genitals would shrivel off while you kept me locked up!? I continue to scream and thrash about in a desperate attempt to free myself. Nothing works. Fucking shit. I must be in hell.

---------
Ive been out of my spongy cell for a few months now. It was hard for my eyes to adjust to the light. I must have been in captivity for longer than I thought. My captors pretend not to understand when I scream at them. The dark cell has been traded in for a more traditional prison made of metal bars. I tried escaping many times, but Ive always been caught. I think my captors are filming me. Those sick sons of bitches. They laugh and taunt me, jiggling my prisons keys just outside my reach. They make fun of my broken body. They take such pleasure in watching me trying to crawl away whenever they take me out of my cell, only to place me back where I started. Their cruelty knows no bounds. They dont even allow me the dignity of using the bathroom on my own. Its just as wellif they treat me like an animal, then I will act like an animal. I find great pleasure in retaliating against them by urinating on them when ever they try to shame me. I feel no shame anymore. I only feel the burning desire for revenge. When they feed me their poisonous food, I toss it back to them and try my hardest to throw up on them. I make a game out of trying to get it into their mouths. I know now that I will never be free, but I sure as fuck wont go down without a fight. I will spend every damn day of this miserable life trying to inflict onto them the same hell theyve inflicted onto me. I wait at night for them to go to bed, and then I scream at the top of my lungs. I enjoy causing them sleep deprivation. Its just a little solace in my otherwise horrid experience.

Sophia, my darling daughter. If you can hear meplease know that I love you. Cher, my beautiful wife, Im sorry I didnt take your advice. I should have just had the meal delivered. I hope you know how much I miss and adore you both. Please know that I am here against my will. I would do anything to be in your arms again.

I love you. 

- Nathan
