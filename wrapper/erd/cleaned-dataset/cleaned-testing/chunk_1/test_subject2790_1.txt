 Was completing a History exam at uni last year. Had finished my first essay question and was taking a little rest before starting the next one.

I looked down and there's a fucking wasp crawling up my top! I had a silent freakout as any noise would have had me kicked out. I swiped the bastard off my top only for it to land on my leg. I then knocked it onto the floor and stomped the shit out of it.

My history tutor happened to walk past at this point and gave me the weirdest look. Really wanted to write an explanation on the exam paper.

 Aged 3/4 I was out at a pub with my family for Sunday lunch. A larger gentleman came in and proceeded to use the fruit machine. His size must have offended me as I immediately turned to my mum and yelled* "MUMMY HE'S FAT!"

My poor mother had to apologise to the man in question and I happily went back to devouring my meal. 




 Vanity Fair - I studied it for my advanced higher dissertation and I struggled to read the book critically as I enjoyed it so much. I still count it as one of my favourites.  




 Philtrum - The space between your nose and lip where it curves.
