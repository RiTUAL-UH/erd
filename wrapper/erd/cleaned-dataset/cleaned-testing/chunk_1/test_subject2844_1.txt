 Most people are disgusting creatures who don't wash their hands after touching their junk. Sad, but true. 




 I apologize for all the nice folks in the USA. I've always encouraged my friends to be mean to foreigners. We are still working on it, but hopefully we will have everything in order by the time you visit. Have a lovely day...asshole ;)

 I showed up to my construction site early one day and found this guy that would hang around the site all the time named Vito blowing a guy. Found out later that he got killed in a terrible way. 




 That's a crappy situation 




 Did the Ginger make it? 




 I was at a party in college drinking and having a good time when a few kids came over that were looking for some trouble. We were out on the front lawn asking their group to move onto the next party and stop causing trouble and they were getting more and more riled up. My buddy put his hand onto one of them to ask them to move down the block when another kid suckerpunched my friend and knocked him out. He immediately took off running, as we gave chase, and he started to run across the street. Right as my buddy grabbed the back of his shirt, the kid got plowed into by a car.

It was a grisly scene. The kid was hit so hard that he went through the car window. He was slumped over the steering wheel of the car and the driver was sitting there motionless with a look I will never forget. The kid's leg was backward and his bone was sticking out of his leg. He was unconscious for a while and we called the cops to send an ambulance as quickly as possible. He woke up after a while and started screaming in pain and trying to pull himself out of the windshield. He was cutting his hands up real bad and a few of us had to restrain him from hurting himself any further. 

Several cops, ambulances, and firetrucks showed up and eventually he was removed from the windshield and taken to the hospital. The car was going 32 MPH according to the police after they measured the skid marks from the car's brakes. The dean of student affairs interviewed me a few times about what happened and told me that the kid had numerous broken bones including the compound fracture of his leg, internal bleeding, a major concussion and needed over 400 stitches. My buddy that grabbed his shirt had to get glass removed from his hand and needed several stitches. The good news is that the kid recovered and returned to school after a few months. I will never forget the whole experience, it was such an intense situation. In a flash of time, a kid's life could have ended, but he luckily was spared. We were obviously pissed at the kid for hitting my friend, but I would never wish that on anyone. 

**TL;DR:** A kid suckerpunched my friend, ran into the street and got hit by a car and ended up halfway through a windshield of a car with terrible injuries.

 On August 7th, 2007 I happened to be lucky enough to be offered to throw out the first pitch of a San Francisco Giants game, as part of Italian Heritage Night. My family booked the biggest block of group tickets and so the Giants ticket office gave us the opportunity to throw out the first pitch and my family chose me. Barry Bonds ended up breaking Hank Aaron's home run record that night when he hit his 756th home run. I ended up getting him to sign the baseball after the game. The ball has my name, the date and the Giants logo monogrammed on it.  




 What a dingleberry move on your part! 




 Phil....Phil Connors? 




 Zero fucks were given that day 




 My cheeks get flushed and sweaty when I eat green apples. I never really noticed that this was unusual until I was wiping some perspiration off my cheeks and my girlfriend asked me why my face was so red. I told her about it and said that I thought this happened to everyone when they ate tart things. She laughed at me, called me weird and assured me that this was not normal. Am I dying? Is this a actual medical affliction?
