 I'm the same. Mainly, though, for me, it's that both hands look pretty bad because I'm a n00b to this stuff.

My suggestion is to stabilize your non-dominant hand with your dominant one. Put your dominant pinkie on your non-dominant palm for painting the thumb, then do the same with your thumb for the others. Works for me on both sides, since I have really shaky hands. 




 What is that glitter? I love it! 




 So Long, Astoria. 




  Franais! and Chers amis, bouvons! with friend who speak French.

Otherwise, Fuck *whatever is troubling us*! 




 Upvote to OP for being a (rare as fuck) female on reddit. 




 As a poor college kid who can barely afford Kamchatka, yours is high-quality. 




 There is a method to the madness. I'm planning on putting candles in all these and strewing them about the house I live in next year. 









 Liquor before wine, gonna be fine. Wine before liquor, never been sicker. 




 I'd heard how good that was. Only reason we did this instead is because I had a really bad time involving schnapps, and I can't stand the stuff anymore. 




 I actually tried to minimize the tits in that photo. Didn't want to seem like a karma whore. 




 We shook it ever once in a while and let it sit for about 45 minutes, or until the candy canes dissolved. 




 If you want to take shots of it, use better quality vodka than we could afford. It may taste a bit like mouthwash, but spending a little more might minimize that. 




 We're poor college students, ok! I know it's retched. It was solely for mixing. 









 I saved this to print out and put next to my liquor cabinet. Thank you.
Edit: double post is doubled. Fuck my phone. 




 I saved this to print out and put next to my liquor cabinet. Thank you. 




 Be careful. Depending on how drunk they were,  they may very well have given you the wrong number. Or,  I suppose,  depending on how attractive you are. But I'll give you the benefit of the doubt  




 As a hot young lady who has recently been played like a card by a hot young man, I can understand.

Fuck boys, then only men I need in my life are Jack, Johnnie, and Jerry. 




 I've been frequenting this subreddit, jealous of all of you in your ability to still get drunk. Next year, I shall be able to go to the liquor store and will be doing so for the family (I'm the one who always gets the stuff for food anyway, they told me they can't wait till I can buy the booze, too). Scotch and ginger ale. Seems bad, considering teh cost of the Scotch, but fuck it, I gotta pilfer anyways. 




 If you're like me, you'll be wasting a lot of green if you try to hand roll. My fingers are just not nimble enough for it, and since I mainly smoke rolled things, using a roller is ideal, for time's sake. 




 I'm an American, and my best friend and I are the only people I know who smoke spliffs often. It might have something to do with our pack-a-day habits, but we love our spliffs. 




 I usually don't upvote manis with crazy stuff glued everywhere (personal preference, do whatever makes you happy), but the Trekkie in me demanded it. 




 Why would it even matter if it was from a her or not? Unless you're guessing Craigslist for meeting another person (sketchy as hell), you can just have it mailed to you. If you're that nervous that a creeper will come, set up a P.O. box. 




 My ex boyfriend's sister was autistic, and I've never seen more beautiful art outside a museum, and even some of that was worse. I'm "gifted" (politically correct for smarter than most) and I can't draw a straight line with a ruler. I have another autistic friend who is on par with me, sort wise. It all depends. 




 Canadian Mist and Canada Dry. I call it extra Canadian drink, eh. 




 Thank you so much for the CoverGirl suggestion! I'd love to be able to spend $24 on one product, but I'm a poor college students, and clearly smokes are slightly more important to me  




 Thanks! I'll look into a lip primer while I'm searching for Christmas presents. 




 Might sound silly, but I'm guessing the blush should match the lipstick? Which means, for pale me, that wouldn't work for red lips. Also, I just use a light powder foundation on my face, so I don't really have a need to get translucent powder just for this.... 




 This is true, but it's becoming a bit of a pain, what with the fact that I have to touch up upwards of ten times a day, for cigarettes alone. I usually give up and wipe it all off before my first class of the day  




 As a smoker, I always have trouble keeping my lipstick from rubbing off in the center of my lips. Is there anything I can do to help this? I really want to wear lipstick more often, but I usually have to go to stain, which dries my lips out, or just balm.

Please, no responses about how bad smoking is for you, trust me, I know.

EDIT: I am a poor college student, so, while I'm sure things that are $24 per are great, they aren't really an option for me. 




 I was afraid I'd recognize it from the pictures. Thankfully, I didn't  




 That is much better than what the poor college kid must resort to. 

In case you were wondering, Extra Canadian Drink is a staple for me. Canadian Mist+Canada Dry. 




 Also if you aren't in one of the ten states with no exceptions. Because fuck Indiana. 




 Yes, she is. And condone is a great word. 




 Good, since I crossed it out for a reason. 




 Bah, I don't know how to delete my double post on mobile! 




 I'll give you a hint: I break rule 37; there are, in fact, girls on the internet. 




 They call me Jay/Cory/Gary, that's not my name! 




 Only do this if your roomie is cool. I don't condone starting roomie wars  




 Not midget. Midge. Like short for Margaret. Don't ask me why. 









 In the post regarding cold weather wear (not sure how to link on mobile), there seems to be indecision about how fashionable the tights, knee high socks, and skirt combination is. Personally, I think it's absolutely adorable. I do it often, with all different types of skirts. This http://www.imgur.com/AYb3O.jpeg is one example. Here http://www.imgur.com/w6VVy.jpeg is another. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think both work.

Thoughts? 




 There are herbal, legal, nicotine free smokes. The brand Extacy is coming to mind. These are usually damiana based, which is the herb on which most synthetic legal high chemicals are sprayed. Extra bonus: damiana tends to make you horny. 




 I live in Bumfuck, Indiana, and I have only not received texts if the other person didn't have my number right.

Edit: I a word. 




 Oh my goodness, yes. This one guy, I still talk to him a lot, but can't really have sex with him anymore (he's got herpes, I don't and want to keep it that way). I've had to step back multiple times because I started to want more than he did and I didn't want to torture myself.... yet I still would go to his bed almost at the drop of a hat. 




 Greater safety, yes. For a lot of women, however, spermicide causes pain, itching, and dryness. Allergies are also not uncommon (I've got one). 

For serious safety, wear a condom, but still dint finish inside her. I had a really paranoid ex who always did this. 




 Personally, even if the person is good at it, I hate having a tongue in my mouth that isn't my own. My ex was the first person to always do this, and I never knew what to do in return. 

I guess, try things like what she did to you. Take it slow, gauge her response. Don't just start by sticking your tongue down her throat. 




 Hmm, I always heard that as "shes ugly everywhere but her (butter) face." I like yours, too. 




 House music competition. Do you mean a music competition in-house, or a competition of different house music artists? 




 I used to not like them because I was bad at them and they seemed tedious. I got better with practice, because I wanted to please my partner. I had an ex to whom I gave at least one blowjob a day for six months. I got pretty damn good at it from that, if I may be so immodest. Now I just love knowing that those sounds and faces he's making are directly caused by me. It's a great feeling. 




 I think we may have the same ex, haha. I always had to start and end every session with head, and hardly ever was it reciprocated. At least I got better at it. 




 Valentine's Day babies, represent! 




 This particular guy would have been bad either way, he was a chauvinist. But yes, he got way too attached and I had to deal with him for a good while after it happened and I said I didn't want more.

I'm sure not all virgins would be like that, but I know I was and this guy was, so I just don't want to deal with it. Besides, it is a decent amount of responsibility, being someone's deflowerer. 




 Because of shitty legal reasons not related to alcohol, I have to go to AA meetings (ok, I could go to NA meetings, but a pothead fits better with alcoholics than meth heads) and I agree that it isn't a joke. A lot of people have to go for legal reasons, some people would get their children taken away if they didn't go, etc.

I understand the joke, and yeah, it's pretty funny. But actual AA meetings are some of the most depressing places ever. Not butthurt, just sayin. 




 As a female who has been called attractive who chugs her fair share of beers, I hope this is at least decently common. 




 From experience, I can only think of two: I don't sleep with virgins or Nazis.
I've deflowered a guy and it was very unpleasant for a while afterwards.
The other? I was in this guy's bed, we were making out and his shirt came off. I saw a giant swastika tattoo. I pushed him away, asked if he was a Nazi. "Does it make it better that it was a prison thing?" That was the day I learned that Nazis turn me off.  




 I personally can't tell a difference between any type of condom, or between sex with a condom and bareback.

The one thing I *can* tell, is the difference between a condom with spermicide and any other type of sex. I know it's probably just me, because I am violently allergic to the stuff (like, lips swell shut and out, sitting down is really painful for a few days), but I've heard from other non-allergic people that it is drying and irritating. 

I'd say go for normal lubrication on your rubbers, in case she is allergic. Because if allergic reactions in your nose or eyes are bad, allergic reactions on your ladybits are awful. 




 Partially because my GP is an ass, partly because I'm in college, but I just never bothered to renew my script after it ran out last September. I hadn't even thought of the waiting list. 




 20-year-old female. Lost my virginity about 18 months ago. 

Have had  piv sex with 15 people, only oral with 2. 

One six-month relationship, four month-or-two-long flings, five less-than-one-month flings, seven one-night-stands. 




 What is the context of this house party? Is it a small group of friends hanging out? Or is it a large group of people getting drunk and grinding all up on each other?

While assuming anything is bad always, getting it in at the end of the night would be more likely at the latter type of party. Just don't be that guy who invites her, goes separately, and tries to dance with her after she's seen you make out with four other girls (that didn't happen to me this weekend or anything). 




 Dodgeball: an excuse for good athletic children to beat the living shit out of the weaker ones in the name of "fun." 




 Pourquoi pas 'moi, en cuisinant du lait?' Trop difficile?

(Also, don't quote me on that verb tense, I've always been bad at present perfect)
Edit: grammar 




 I already had these views on love. We've got multiple soul mates, and yeah, attraction at first sight is a thing, but love is a completely different matter. Love involves personalities that work together, matching sex drives, equal levels of emotional attachment, and all sorts of other things. 




 I have to move out Friday. It'll be clean then. 




 The mobile phone is a beautiful thing. Auto correct is the best. 




 You gotta learn how to pour that shit, man. You gotta tilt both the glass and the bottle/can.

 WOOOOOO, KAWLWGE! 




 Is a beer ok? I don't have any liquor for shots. 




 See, this particular paper is just a long rant in French about how "one true love" and "love at first sight" is a load of bullshit. I have to reference a couple works of 19th century French literature (can you tell yet that I'm a French major?) which, from my knowledge of the texts, all have to do with either "love makes life miserable" or "everything in my life sucks and I hate it all." I get to write two short papers for the class, so one is dealing with love, the other will be dealing with how literature from before modern psychology effected the idea that mental health is something that one should be at least reasonably knowledgeable about.

I'm not in serious paper writing mode or anything.
 




 Yes. Yes it is. And my roommate and I both have fridges. Not bragging or anything.

Also, auto correct makes me happy  









 Your body is made of chemicals. The air is a chemical. From a scientific view, everything is a chemical.

 The Pure Ice Electric! (sparkly black) is my favorite polish ever. I wear it at least once a week, and I tend to do my nails daily. 




 I wear cardigans daily. Clearly that means I need to drink cardigans daily. 




 I'm usually a /r/trees person, but I can't smoke anymore because reasons. You guys make me happy. I love you. 




 Go to a diner or something that has a large variety. Study the menu, then get whatever strikes your fancy.

 A former FWB did this to me all the time. It was wonderful, especially because I've got a really bad back.

 Hello trees. I recently got arrested and had to give up the herb for a few months. I want to tell you all the story of how I learned that this plant is the best medication I could every ask for.

I'm a young female ent. I'm in college. I have a family history of depression, anxiety, OCD, and alcoholism. The first three have plagued me my whole life.

I did ballet for nine years growing up, which is not a healthy environment for a kid. It forces you, from a very young age, to try for perfection in every aspect of your life, which is simply unattainable and unhealthy. At age 12 I started cutting myself to cope with the feelings of inadequacy. By age 15 I was doing it every day. At 16 I was put on anti-anxiety medication by a doctor, which made me feel like an empty shell of a person. Instead of anxious and all the other emotions, I just felt no emotions. I was a bitch, and more people than I can count called me crazy on a daily basis. I didn't have any real friends, I never saw anyone outside of school.

Right before I graduated high school, I found an old childhood friend on Facebook. The same day he added me, he messaged me telling me we should hang out. Two hours later, I was in his car with some of his friends on the way to a beautiful lake in the country. We swim for a while, then get back up on the dock. He whips out a joint and lights it up. When he passed it to me, I said I had never smoked before, and his face instantly lit up. "Try it," he said, "you'll like it."

I had never felt so uplifted and happy in my life. It was like all the unnecessary, stupid worries that had always plagued me were dissolved from my brain. I just started laughing uncontrollably, almost crying because I had never been as relaxed as I was then.

I smoked every day for a year and a half. I got arrested, and as part of the treatment program the man put me in, I have to pass two piss tests. It has been two weeks today. I feel like I did for the six years leading up to that day. I have either gotten drunk or cut myself every day. I hate it. It is unhealthy, makes me feel like shit the next day, and isn't a good thing, considering the strong history of alcoholism in my family.

I am not applying to any graduate schools in states that don't allow medical marijuana. And I hope, if any of you other ents get to feeling low, anxious, and miserable like I've been and will be for the next few months, you will read this and remember: trees can help. I'm sure, for some of you, it won't, but for me, it is the best thing out there.

Toke one up for those who haven't yet discovered this magical plant. Not even for me, for that would be selfish. I hope that, one day, no one will have to cover up their bodies to hide from the embarrassment of self-inflicted injuries. No one will turn to the blade because they will have the herb instead.  




 Truth.... Still not something you want to put on Facebook. 




 A visible bulge is nothing compared to what (it seems like) lazy college students wear. I know precisely the shape of most of my male friends' penises, because they really enjoy the basketball-shorts-with-no-underwear look. If you can't see the shape of the head of your member, it's fine with me. 




 I was about to ask the same thing. Might have something to do with the fact that it's all I got in my last relationship, so I had to figure out what worked. Only time I've ever orgasmed from just PIV sex was in Cowgirl. 




 4/20 always lands in the middle of Little 500 weekend (bike race/best party weekend in the country). Which means my humble abode welcomes police from five neighboring counties, as well as some out of state ones. This year it's on the day of the men's race, also known as the day with the most arrests in the state, if I'm not wrong.

IU ent problems. 




 Being 14 is not an excuse for not understanding this. This is taught in basic health class from when you were young

Unless you went to a school with abstinence only sex education or (like me) none at all. Enough girls in my high school got pregnant that you'd think they'd put two and two together.
 









 Me too, although I've also heard those called pops or poppers. 




 The Blue Moon pumpkin ale is one of my new favorite things. 




 Uptoke for cowboy killers (my cigarette of choice). 




 I also see it as "wow, you're cool. No one can connect your face with all that illegal substance. And no one who doesn't approve can see." Be responsible with your trees, kids. Getting arrested really sucks. 




 I used to be like that. I hated being on top because I didn't know what I was doing. I either sat on the guy's dick or was folded over on top of him; either way, he was still doing most of the work.

Now being on top is second only to doggy. I do a lot of moving my hips by moving my body (former swimmer, it's a lot like the dolphin kick without the legs) and what are actually very similar to a man's thrusts, but with more emphasis on the back swing (if we're facing each other). I recently had some amazing sex on top doing this, I was able to be fucked as hard as I wanted without having to ask him to go harder.

As mentioned before, though, you are still a good lay if you keep doing what you're doing. If you want to do more, try adjusting the angle of your hips in missionary. To build up strength, try dancing around when you're alone. Focus on moving your hips in a circle while keeping your top half relatively still. It's a good ab workout, which never hurts anyway. 




 I've shaved every day for three years. Sometimes I get little bumps and it can get a little itchy at the end of the day, but I usually don't have any problems. 




 Because what else are those sad excuses for novels good for? 




 I do believe you go to the same school as me. Or I'm just high. Hoosier? 




 So, I've been seeing this guy for a couple weeks now, but we haven't gone on any real dates. We met and hit it off really well, but didn't really hang out. Then, three Fridays ago, he happens to be part of the crew I'm leading to a party (we're in college in my hometown, so everyone relies on me to know where places are) and I just sort of decide to make moves on him. We leave the party to get smokes and he decides to bum to me for the night. We leave with his roommate to go to another party, then we end up very drunkenly wandering around campus. I end up going back to his dorm and we have sex. Next day he comes over to my dorm, we cuddle under a blanket for hours and then he spends the night. We hung out nearly every day, sometimes spending the night. A week after that first night, he invites me over to his friend from home's house and he has his arm around me for most of the night as a lot of other people from his hometown come over. I went over there again last night with his roommate and got way too drunk and the guy ended up having to take care of me, which I hate. I apologize and he says it isn't a big deal and happens to everyone.

What's bothering me is that we haven't had the 'are we dating' conversation because I don't want to rush it, nor do I really even know what I want. However, multiple people have either asked me if we're dating, or congratulated me on my new 'relationship.' I'm very confused, because I don't think what we've been doing is dating, but other people seem to think so. Are we dating? We haven't gone out anywhere together, there's just an obvious mutual interest.

Tl; dr, I've been hanging out and having sex with this guy I'm into, but I don't think we're dating, despite what other people say. Are we? 




 It may not be great. It may hurt a bit. My first time was great, didn't hurt at all, and generally awesome, but that seems to be unusual. I fell into the 'we had sex, now I'm in love with you' trap, although that may be because I had known the guy since childhood. 

As for getting handsy, follow his lead. Start off with a hand in his hair and one on his neck. Slide one down his chest or his back. I like to lightly massage his shoulders. Then grab his hips, pull him in closer. If he touches any part of you, it's fair game to touch the same parts of him. I really like to rub all around his cock, but not touch him until he starts rubbing in between my legs. If he's not hard enough for you to feel it through his pants by then, don't worry. He'll get there. 









 This week I fucked a guy I've had my eye on for a while now. We went to a party with a bunch of friends, then decided to leave for another one. We were pretty drunk by the time we left the second party, and then had to make the trek across campus. We held hands and stopped on several benches just to cuddle and look at the stars. We got back to his dorm and sat listening to Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here (one of my all-time favorite albums) while making out. Things got hot and heavy and I ended up spending the night. Next day he and his roommate come to my dorm just because and we ended up sitting cuddled under a blanket outside for hours and hours. Then he came to my room, we laid in bed and watched tv for a while before fucking. He spent the night and most of the day. 

Seems less like a sexual achievement, but I have been afraid to let myself just be intimate without having sex since I got out of my first LTR. I've had hook ups, and a short fling (I had to break it off because I started to have feelings that we both knew would never be reciprocated), but I feel so comfortable with this kid. I'm just going to let it keep happening and see where it goes, but I really think I could let myself get feelings for him without it being unrequited. 

Also, he helped me with my insecurities about my oral skills -- he had to stop me multiple times because I was "just too good at it." 









 This is one of my favorite things to do to a man. I LOVE doing it and looking up into his eyes as he gasps and moans. But maybe I'm just weird. 




 We can't help you Doug, we're too high. 




 I also am diagnosed with GAD, and I have tripped a few times. I dropped acid the first time three days after a massive panic attack, and it went fine. It may help you to write on yourself. I have seen people put "don't panic," "it's just the drug," or "enjoy yourself" on their arms. That can really help, because, if you get lost in your own head, you can look down and see the words. 

As has been said already, don't let yourself be alone. It is good to have a sober person with you, so that you have someone who knows to watch out for you. I think LSD and other psychedelics have helped me figure things out, including the sources of my anxiety.

I hope it turns out well for you. 




 This! 
And boys, if you didn't know why they put that warning on the stuff, its because, when you have a boner, the blood is trapped in there until you soften up. While the blood is trapped, it can't bring fresh oxygen to the cells in the penis. After four hours, a lot of those cells will have died. After long enough, the entire penis will die and, ultimately, fall off.

 Even better, just poke holes in the bottom of the bottle. Also, spray some febreeze into the sploof.
