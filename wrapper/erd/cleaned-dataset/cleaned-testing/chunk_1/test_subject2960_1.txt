 This is some excellent advice. My intelligence has made me bitter and jaded, I'm unfortunately a bit of an idealist so when the world doesn't live up to my ideals I become bitter about it. It's something I've really come to terms with, that it is better to be humble and kind than intelligent and cold. I hope it is something that I only get better at as I get older. That being said I really need to work on myself socially as I still see social interaction as a mechanical thing that other people find organic. 




 I have a ridiculously high standard for myself too, perfectionism is something that often leads me to depression. I have similar mechanical thinking when it comes to social interaction. What comes easy to other people, simply talking, small talk I guess, is a painful thing for me. I have to try to perform small talk. I remember being maybe 12, and attempting to analyze the way the "popular kids" spoke to each other so I could maybe mimic it.  I just can't function it seems. 




 Yeah it brought up a lot of problems in my last romantic relationship when I started experiencing depression again. I have it twofold people like me when I have my shallow mask put up, this fake person who likes what everyone else likes and goes with the flow, but as soon as I ever open up and talk about something "deep" with a person they usually remove themselves from my life. So I just expect people to leave now. 




 I should be in my third year, but I've dropped out because of depression. I was undiagnosed until July this year, which is miserable considering how long I've been suffering from it. At least I'm on the road to getting better now. 




 This is exactly my school experience. I was always beaten down for being ahead of my classmates. It was pretty miserable being a ten year old and having no one else around me understand what I was talking about. 




 Yeah, my family moved at very key developmental stages where I lost all my friends and any kind of social circle I may have been building. I'm more of a failed extrovert than a true introvert. My social life is screwed up. 




 Yeah I know how that feels. I mentioned in another comment how I have a numbing existential pain that follows me around no matter how happy or content I am. 




 I like it a lot, it's very underrated. It's all about the characters in the story, not so much the campy scifi that surrounds it. 




 So far all it has caused me is absolute pain. I'd say I'm socially stunted as a result of intelligence, which has lead me to not trust people. I've dropped out of college not due to lack of success, but because I don't trust myself. I would gladly trade my intelligence for happiness. 




 I relate with everything you just mentioned. Even before I was diagnosed with depression I had this subtle knowledge that felt like I wasn't meant to be happy. I really appreciate the quote at the bottom too, thanks. 




 I like Kurt Vonnegut, he has a sad, uplifting, and absurd way of looking at the world and why people do things. I'd recommend Slaughterhouse-Five. Anything by Mark Twain too, especially his short stories and novellas.  




 I've never been tested, though based on my performance I'd guess I'm considered well above average intelligence. I sympathize with what you're saying at the end. I've ruined a lot of close relationships, I'm isolating myself, and I've dropped out of university (not because I was underperforming just because I can't take life anymore.) I feel like I'm either going to beat this and be the person I've always wanted to be, or I lose and kill myself.  




 It's always at the back of my mind, it's like a numbing anxiety that just leads me back to depression. 




 I was like that through highschool, I grew up in a rural town quite literally in the middle of nowhere. All my teachers always thought I was the smartest kid in the school, and I showed it in the last year, came second highest g.p.a. in my grad class. I spent most of my grad year not depressed, so that may have helped. 




 That's very interesting! thanks for sharing. 




 I like a lot of art films. Andrei Tarkovsky, and Wim Wenders are two of my favorites directors. I think there's a lot in their works that speaks to the INFJ mindset. I especially like the movies Stalker, and Wings of Desire. In mainstream films I really like Bladerunner and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind.   




 Recently my therapist brought up the possibility that I may be gifted. I suffered from depression during my childhood and apart from periods where I was too apathetic to care I did excellent in school. I've heard it said that depression is common amongst people with high intelligence. I just wanted to ask amongst this community and get some perspective.  




 Due to some recent circumstances I've started seeking counselling. I've gone to see a psychiatrist and have been diagnosed with depression and some obsessive compulsive tendencies. From what I've read I think I may have BPD.

I'm a 20 year old male. Since I was little I can remember having serious mood swings. I feel very needy when it comes to other people, I'm also very afraid of them leaving me. I've had attacks of anger or crying when someone leaves me or when big plans change at the last minute. I've lied about random things because I feel insecure. Stupid things like going to a certain concert or something like that. During worse parts of my life I've had suicidal ideation and mixed with feelings of abandonment I have almost self harmed. I have threatened suicide, and have a dramatic streak when I feel I can no longer cope. I have had paranoid thoughts about almost anything you can imagine. I drink to self medicate. I always think that people close to me are just looking for an excuse to bail out of my life, and if they do leave I have major panic attacks. There's has been a pattern of people walking out on me so I'm always ready to drop someone else first, this causes problems in my relationships. I always feel a compulsion to impress people that I meet for the first time. I have fairly idealistic or black and white world views and will devalue people who disagree with me. I've been physically violent with people close to me in the past, and sometimes throw things when I'm angry. When I was younger I had a bad habit of acting out in an attempt to get others to accept me. I was bullied a lot from 8-14, partly because I believe I was already depressed at that age.

 




 I can remember from a young age having spells of crying, or on the verge of crying. I can remember having spells of this even up to around the age of 17 or so. I've always just felt overwhelmed by negative emotions at times, and have gotten inappropriately weepy at times. I'm new to my diagnosis so I'm still trying to find out what fits into my description or not. I can say with confidence that I've suffered from depression and anxiety before this most recent spell, but is this not being able to control negative emotions during circumstantial events fall within the realm of my depression? 




 This entirely, it's such a viscous cycle. All I can think about is how I've been weak and failed in the past. How am I supposed to build confidence when I have such an awful track record; then it just feeds into the next bought of depression.  




 Yeah I get that way too. That's when I can take a lot of work load, it's kind of like "buckle down, weather the storm, you should be in a good place when the feeling comes back just do these things in the mean time." Then it doesn't work out and I end up angry and frustrated.
 




 Thanks a lot for the response. I'm not holding any illusions as to continuing this relationship. The thing that bothers me the most about the whole situation is how out of character this was for me. I've never done things like this before and it makes me sick to think that I ever even got angry at her for anything. I'm just trying to get back to who I was before this year with the added experience. I want to be stable longer before I date anyone else let alone her. She does matter a lot to me and if I've lost her for ever than so be it, but I think that things might be better for the both of us if she knows what's happening with me.

P.S. Thanks a lot, it's been really difficult so far, but at the same time it's good to know where those emotions came from in the first place. I've got a long road ahead of me, but I'm taking off time to make sure that I never act like this again. 




 The people who are suggesting counselling are correct, if you have not yet tried counselling than that is a good direction to go. Anger is not a good way to communicate in a relationship and there needs to be healthier ways to go about it. Anger is generally a sign of other issues, it is not okay that he takes this out on you but both of you should seek counselling. If he doesn't seek counselling or seem to make any improvement than you should start thinking of ways to leave. 




 I've been there before, just many years ago now. I'd say this time was a bit different being out on my own though. University can do a number on you. 




 already did, looking for wider feedback.
 




 When I wasn't actively being depressed it would come out as anger in general. I was overly judgemental to a lot of people and was generally dissatisfied with everything around me. 









 I'm a 20 year old male. I've been suffering from major depression for years and only over the past few months have I actually been diagnosed. I've found with my depression I have periods of anxiety that lead to depression, which I eventually push down so I can actually function. So I'm severely depressed at the same time as being able to maintain a fairly substantial work load. That being said I can only focus on my work load anything else is too much. Eventually my depression starts coming out again and the facade that I put up cracks. It usually starts to break down after a few months with angry outbursts, crying randomly and then suicidal ideation until I'm full on depressed again.  

So has anyone else felt this way before. That you can push down your depression for a period of time but it ends up coming out again as anger, anxiety or frustration? 




 Thanks a lot for this. I'm not looking to get her back, I'd be lying if I said that's not what I would like, but I'm not expecting anything and I need to get healthy before I can date anyone again. I just want her to know that I'm sorry and that nothing that happened was her fault. She didn't mention any of this stuff when we broke up, even though I asked. I guess she didn't feel it was needed. Anyway, I'm sure she knows something is up with me, it was pretty obvious looking back, but for me it wasn't at the time. I just don't know how to talk to her about it. I mean calling her up and being like "Hey haven't talked in a while, I've been diagnosed with a mental illness, sorry for all the garbage I put you through" seems a little forward. Thanks for the response. 




 Me and my ex dated for 2.5 years we broke up in april; before we started dating we'd been friends for 3 years I'm 20, she's 21. I didn't take care of myself and I treated her like garbage. She has so many completely valid reasons to never want to speak to me again. I became completely focused on school without any regard to anything else, it was all I could handle. I had what I would call an existential crisis that triggered clinical depression. I went to a counsellor early on when i was feeling a lot of anxiety, they told me I should speak with a philosopher. I wasn't sleeping at night, wasn't eating, was missing showering every other day, and falling asleep in the afternoon or in class. Lost interest in everything I enjoy, was a snob to my friends, and walked around with a chip on my shoulder.
 
I did so many things that were absolutely crazy, and obviously signs that something was seriously wrong with me, but I didn't do anything about it at the time. I became a complete misanthrope, I hated everybody and criticized everyone including her parents. I became dependent on her. In the last few months we ended up fighting a lot and I almost hit her, like raised my hand and said I wanted to, but didn't. I did end up shoving her once. I'm so ashamed about what happened. But wait there's more. I became kind of semi-controlling and I was jealous of one of her guy friends, who I probably was right about but I let how I felt affect me too much. I definitely crossed the line with that too, I just felt like I wasn't good enough at all. I didn't do enough for her birthday and valentine's day. It was just dinner, flowers, and a gift but I felt I should have done more. During all of this I was spending a lot of time playing video games because without realizing it I couldn't deal with my own life.

During a panic attack I had I almost cut myself, I've never done something like that before it was crazy, she stopped me from doing that. I was off handedly mentioning killing myself like an "maybe I should just kill myself then I wouldn't have to deal with" ____ whatever problem I was having. 

After she broke up with me at the end of the school year, I didn't leave my apartment for 2 weeks, I just cried. I couldn't piece things together, I didn't talk to anyone I was just dead. It took me a month to realize how messed up I had been. I've since gone in and had pscyhiatric assessment done. I've been diagnosed with severe major depression. I'm seeing a therapist and am on medication.

I've never been like this before, I've always been a patient, caring and loving person. I was the one who could take the pressure in our relationship, but I lost it. This past year has been so out of character it's difficult to describe. Apparently my friend's and family has been very worried about me but didn't say anything.

Me and my ex haven't been speaking very often since the break up. She wanted to stay friends (for some reason I don't understand) but I told her that we both needed space. She said that she'd be there if I needed anything. I told her I wouldn't. Anyway, now I've dropped out of college for this year while I get my head back together. 

Do you think that I should tell this girl why I acted the way I did? I'm feel so ashamed about what's happened, I have a hard time believing it myself.  She was my best friend for five years and the last 9 months have completely ruined that. 

TL;DR: I've been diagnosed with severe depression. I've acted like a monster for almost a year, my ex left me with good reason. I feel like I should talk to my ex and at least give her an explanation for why I acted the way I did.
