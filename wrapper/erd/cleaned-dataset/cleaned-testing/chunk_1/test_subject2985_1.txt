 Nice shot! 




 A zealot hero would be my first choice as a starcraft warrior, but I think there are numerous other possibilities. Ultralisks, roaches, and immortals come immediately to mind. A marauder might also be interesting as a hybrid warrior/assassin. Kind of like Sonya, but instead of getting right into the fray, it'd be more focused on zoning enemies out.

The firebat idea is a cool one, I wouldn't have thought of that. 




 My suggestion is to friend the good/friendly people you play with after the matches. You can build up a really good group very quickly that way. 




 Why does he use such a long knife? Seems like it would be awkward to wield, though he certainly isn't having any difficulties with it. 




 I had no idea you could do this. I hope they bring it back, because I always split Olaf off and control Baelof and Erik together, and frequently wished I could bind the latter two together. 




 His D is rather tenacious. 




 I've experienced this a few times since the patch. It happens infrequently, but it definitely happens, and exactly as you say, as soon as I engage in combat for the first time, the game lags for about 3 seconds. 




  It's basically proven that raving toxic lunatics lose more games, and I'd bet my bottom dollar that the kind of person who would use a mute-all button and that toxic jerk are a lot alike, and I want neither on my team.

You've used the phrase "toxic lunatics". Read your comment history, and tell me, honestly, that you wouldn't call somebody who behaves as you do "toxic". Your last 10 comments are extremely hostile and negative. I stopped counting after that, but I'm guessing that this is pretty much your MO.

I mean this seriously, I really think you should do a self evaluation, because your behavior suggests that you've got some serious anger problems that need to be addressed. 




 I think you meant to respond to the parent of my comment. 




 Patch day is normally the second Tuesday.

According to whom? Just because that's when they usually do it, doesn't mean that it's late if they don't. They never said the patch would be two weeks ago. They said it would be early this week, and it was. You need to adjust your expectations, not to mention your sense of entitlement.

If what you meant is that, then you are thanking them for completing their scheduled B.Net maintenance at the time they promised.

I am thanking them for completing the patch at the time that they promised, because that's something that I want to encourage.

Imagine you're Blizzard, and if, like you, everyone were to complain whether you complete the work late or on time, you've got little motivation to be on time.

Truth be told, my post probably doesn't have any meaningful impact on whether they're late or on time in the future, but they were on time yesterday, I appreciated it, and it only took 30 seconds to say so. So I said so. I wouldn't really call that "hero worship", but if you'd like to, by all means. 




 The only thing worse is accidentally dismounting by hitting the mount key, and it's only worse because there is absolutely no good reason for the dismount key/command. Right clicking the mini-map at least serves a purpose.

But yeah, I agree, accidental mini-map clicking is something they absolutely need to fix. It's definitely gotten me killed more than a few times. 




 You mean almost two weeks late with undocumented changes?

What are you talking about? How are they two weeks late?

They said the patch would be yesterday from 3am to 11am PST. The game was back up no later than 10:55am PST. 




 Am I right that if you're not going to kill the towers that it's best to leave them at 1 or 2 bullets, so they don't recharge after you leave? 




 Gorgeous 




 Actually that was meant as a nerf. Ghost Uther was way to powerful before. 

But they are similar, so yeah, hopefully a change is coming for Tyrael, too.  




 Wow, thanks for pointing that out. I totally didn't make the connection. 




 I so wish this would have included a total rework for Tyrael's practically non-existent trait. Alas.

Tons of great changes, though. Can't wait to try them out! I really hope the performance optimizations are significant. 




 What is this referencing? 




 Worthy cause. 




 Yeah. It's just terrible. It almost never does anything of value. I'd much rather have something that helps me *avoid* dying. 




 Agreed on Tyrael (never played Anub'arak). If they just gave Tyrael a worthwhile trait, preferably something that made him a bit more tanky, he'd be okay. 




 I hate Thrall's. It might be thematic, but he goes from intimidating to... not intimidating. 




 Please this. I so want a true solo queue where all 10 players queued solo. 




 Ah, couldn't find the VODs before. I see them now. Thanks! 




 More taxes on the poor.

If this makes you mad, and it should, consider the impact that all of this hopeless desperation has on crime (spoiler alert: it's not going to go down).

Then take a moment and connect the dots: increasing financial burden on the poor, lowering taxes for the rich, and privatizing everything. Where does that lead you?

In other news, Ted Cruz announced that he's running for president today.

Hmmm.... 




 That sounds great. Do you know if his videos are available somewhere? He's only got one up on YouTube. 




 People using abilities just to use them drive me crazy. I'm looking at you, Gorge Stitches. 




 Seems like it. My game DC'd. 




 Same. Yet to see it. 




 The plants would basically provide better insulation. You'd still save money, but I'm with you. I'd rather be generating electricity. 




 He's a lot of fun, but he needs a different trait. The current one is practically non-existent. He's a tank, so he doesn't die a lot (more often than not I'll end a game with zero deaths), it's super easy to avoid the explosion, and even if it hits, the chances of it having a meaningful impact are pretty low.

I'd much rather him have a trait that will help me avoid dying. Given the fact that he's not the tankiest tank, and doesn't put out very much damage, I think giving him a useful trait would put him closer to balanced. 




 That looks amazing. If I didn't have a strong preference for characters that I really like looking like themselves (such as Tassadar), I would definitely buy this skin.

 What if I told you I wanted to have the right to NOT vote? What if I thought voting legitimatize this violent entity?

Submit a blank ballot.

What if I don't want to endorse either democrats or republicans for executive office?

Vote for somebody else, write somebody in, or leave the ballot blank.

Would I be forced to endorse in candidates I strongly disagree with?

No. 




 I certainly hope so. The Protoss are awesome. I'd be happy with anyone out of the Starcraft or Diablo universes, though. 




 That was what I was most looking forward to, too. Very disappointing.

  Legalization won't stop over-age people giving pot to younger people.

What's your point?

"Drug dealers don't ID," and they won't when it's legal (they will still sell pot to youngsters).

Sure, but there will be a lot less illegal pot, especially as more and more states and countries legalize. You don't see kids buying bathtub gin or black market cigarettes. 




 We ended up using JsonFx, because we needed something that worked with iOS. We found it to be somewhat limited and had to hack our way around a few issues, but it got the job done.

We ended up dropping JSON due to size considerations in the end, though, and went with Protobuf instead. 




 I know, it was a joke. 




 Both pretty lackluster. Are we sure these aren't warrior cards? 




 If you're being vastly outnumbered and I run towards you to heal you so you can escape do not run back into the fight, I cannot keep you up.

I hate this so much, and it transcends support. Countless times I've put myself at risk or pop a valuable CD to buy a doomed teammate a small window of escape, but they read it as "reinforcements have arrived, let's do this thing!" and turn around to re-engage the 3+ enemies chasing them.

The end result is always the same: they die immediately and now I'm in the hopeless situation that they were in.

Thanks guy. Thanks. 




 Yet relatively left, figuratively.  




 Free money for everyone, basically.

Here's a good introduction:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIL_Y9g7Tg0

Check out /r/basicincome for more. 




  If people receive money for no reason, then they will just sit around doing nothing.

If you started getting $1,000 checks each month, guaranteed for life, would you quit your job and do nothing? 




 Basically, you give everyone (without exception) free money (without conditions) every month because:

1. We live in a time where resources are abundant enough that we can easily provide the basic necessities of life (food, shelter, healthcare, etc.) for everyone.
2. Automation and efficiency are crushing jobs left and right, and it's only going to get worse.

 WHY THE HELL IS THERE AN UNMOUNT BUTTON!? IT SERVES ABSOLUTELY NO PURPOSE, AND SOMETIMES I ACCIDENTALLY DISMOUNT FORGETTING OR NOT REALIZING I'M ALREADY MOUNTED. SO INSTEAD OF GOING FASTER, LIKE I INTENDED, I END UP GOING SLOWER!

REMOVE THE POINTLESS DISMOUNT BUTTON OR LET US BIND IT TO A DIFFERENT KEY, BLIZZARD! 




 I'd contact the League of Women Voters in your state. They can probably point you in the right direction. /r/ask_politics is probably also a good resource. You might also contact the show. They research this stuff pretty thoroughly, and seem to like getting people involved, so they might also be able to provide you with some help/ideas.

If you still come up empty, reply here and I'll do a little digging myself.

You might also contact your federal representatives and express your support for statehood for territories. Also, share the video with your friends. Awareness always helps a cause.

Good luck!

 That's clever. Roughly the same effect, but quite a bit more versatile, and thus not entirely dependent on spell power.

I like it! 




 Can't confirm, but I don't see why it wouldn't. 




 And deadly poison :( 




 I meant it's not worth your time to try and take advantage of the system. 




 This results in Mars somehow having even less electricity than it currently does. 




  Little did they understand that they can play the game of using cash when it favours you, and using other payments when it doesn't.

I would argue that you couldn't possibly do this to an effect greater than $1 a month, and your time is worth more than that. Thus, it never favors you. 




 Thanks. Deleted this and the other duplicate. 




 How is Warsong Commander broken? 




 Bad warrior card: Check.

Awaiting amazingly powerful mage card. 




 What? 




 Yeah, I'm sure you're right and the balance will be a lot less one sided over time. I don't need an exact 33% split between the three major franchises, but something a little more balanced would be nice. 




 [Tosh](http://www.styleweekly.com/binary/f593/night15_daniel_tosh.jpg) would be bad ass. 




  I love all blizz universes so im probobly bias :P

Well, I love them all, too. That's why I wish the others had more of a presence in HotS. 




 *More*, sure. I just wish it wasn't *most*. 




 7 Wacraft heroes and 0 Starcraft heroes is believable. 3 Diablo characters is not. 




 Ha, sorry :P. 




 Grats! 




 That sounds sensible. Any suggestions for what to say to steer them politely? 




 Yeah, I think the issue was that I didn't have a background image on my mask, or something like that. 




 Google's RSS reader :( 




 That's cool. I like how it just only uses gravity and the conductivity of the copper. I can't believe how fast it is, nor how perfect the sphere is.

Very neat, very clever. 




 That was awesome. 




 Seriously. What the hell. 




 I'm really excited to see what the next version looks like. If they can slim them down and trim $100 from the price, I think I might be interested. 




 Wow. That channel is a gold mine. I could watch these for hours, and I don't even drink!

Thank you for sharing that. 




 I like it, but it would be better if we could have a "mute frequently muted players" option. If you're a jerk, you get flagged and then people don't have to listen to you, but can still communicate with their positive teammates. After a while, the status wears off, lasting longer the more frequently you end up flagged. 




 What am I looking at? Is this the angularjs.org equivalent of Angular 2.0? 




 Good call. Moving post. 




 Ideally I'd like to see:

* An in-depth preview of and release date for Tomb of the Spider Queen
* 3-4 new heroes announced, hopefully not all Warcraft heroes
* New features, such as spectator mode
* More info on the Diablo map
* Pipe dream: announcement of ranked solo and/or random queue 




 If it was as tight and polished as Hearthstone and had something akin to the arena to hold my interest (and let me build up my collection without financial investment), I'd consider it.

Honestly, I'd probably still be playing Solforge if it was as well done as Hearthstone. I thought that game was super compelling, but the actual user experience was very lacking.

I'd play those other games in addition to, not in place of, Hearthstone, though. Hearthstone is awesome. 




 Lime flies when you're halving fun.

 Your frustrations are certainly understandable. Our electoral system does not promote good candidates. Fortunately, there are a number of easy reforms that could correct (or at least improve) the situation. [Here is one such solution that you might find interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE list=UU2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w), and perhaps even fighting for.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this, and enjoy your first election! 




 Beautiful. Gameplay doesn't look very compelling, but it certainly is gorgeous. 




 Just curious, why did this (rather well thought-out) comment necessitate a throwaway? 




 Oh yeah, love that one. 




 LEDs are pretty cheap now. You can get them for ~$7, they last for decades, and they only use like 6 watts. I get them $3 per bulb from my power company. 




 It's up there with [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YkLPxQp_y0) as best one yet, in my opinion. 




 Good luck with your RL stuff. I hope things go well for you. 




 Aye! 




 Why don't they shoot sequels immediately after, then, to take advantage of those same savings? 




 Dunno. I wouldn't pay it much mind. 




 Definitely a must read. Steuver is an amazing writer. 




 Very pretty. Keep up the good work! 




 Three quick pointers:

1. Don't fight pointlessly, especially in the beginning.
2. Experience is extremely important, don't leave a lane empty unless there's a very good reason.
3. If your team is down a person, avoid a fight. If their team is down a person, pick a fight (or try for an objective/mercs).

Good luck and have fun! 




 Same. 




 this stuff takes time

No, it takes competition. The US pays more for slower and lower quality internet access than most of the developed world, and it's entirely because ISPs have a monopolistic hold on their industry. They have no incentive to do better, because we have no choice.

We're lucky to have even two options in Cincinnati (though that only gets us so far), most people only have one, but Google coming to town would not only give us the option of working with a good provider, and also force the bad (Cincinnati Bell) and terrible (Time Warner) providers to do better. 




 I do agree, we are lucky to have a choice (most people don't), and it's nice that some people in the area can get gigabit speed (though sadly I'm not one of them).

That said, Cincinnati Bell's not that much better than Time Warner in terms of customer service/relations, so it would be nice to have a good company like Google come in and raise the bar for customer experience, service, pricing, etc.. 




 Three things to consider:

1. Cincinnati Bell's gigabit service isn't available everywhere. It's certainly not available to me, or I'd be using it. I'm not sure that they offer fiber everywhere yet, either.
2. Competition will force Bell and Time Warner to do better. There's a reason Time Warner and Comcast are among the worst companies in America, and that's the monopoly that they have on their industry. We're lucky to have a second option, though Cincinnati Bell doesn't raise the bar very much. Google most definitely will.
3. Cincinnati Bell's customer service sucks. It's not as bad as Time Warner's, but it's pretty bad. I can't speak to Google's customer service, but they have a reputation for doing things right and for not trying to do everything as cheaply as possible.

3 is the biggest factor as far as I'm concerned. It would be nice to have a faster connection, but the thing I hate the most about our situation is having to choose between Cincinnati Bell (bad) or Time Warner (incredibly bad, and only going to get worse when they've merged with Comcast) and dreading every interaction that I have with them. 




 Did your parents not notice this pattern and perhaps stop taking your brother's (only) word for everything? 




 [There were a number of them in 2014](https://mayday.us/), and will almost definitely be more in 2016. Mostly democrats, but a few republicans and independents as well. 




 Working (if you can), watching Netflix, playing a game, reading an article, reading a book, looking out the window, Skyping with family/friends, etc.. Pretty much whatever you want to do.

If you want to stare at the car ahead of you, like you would be if you were driving the car, then go for it. But I'm guessing most people would/could find ways to put that time to better use if they didn't have to concentrate on the road.

You'll basically have more options (and a safer journey) than you do now. 




 Sorry, I just had futurgasm

 STV is a little different, in that it's a form of proportional representation. It's basically RCV with multiple seats, which pretty much eliminates the problem of gerrymandering, as well as provides better (proportional, if you will) representation. STV is definitely better, but not every seat can be made into multiple seats (mayors, governors, treasurers, the president, etc.), and where we can't, RCV is the way to go.

Here are videos describing each system:

[RCV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE list=UU2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w)

 Actually, it's already in use all over the country. Colleges and director boards love it (because it's way superior), and even a few cities (e.g. Oakland, San Francisco, and Minneapolis) are already using it.

I totally take your point, though, a whole state adopting it for all elections would be a fantastic example with significant visibility. 




 It's rather unfathomable that marijuana could be legal recreationally but not medically. 




 Well, on behalf of everyone who thinks that women should be able to feed their children wherever without fear of judgement, harassment, stares, etc., thank you all for doing this. As you can see, there's quite a bit of support behind your message, and while there are certainly some regrettable opinions on the matter, I think it will definitely help to (to at least a tiny degree) further the discussion and affect positive societal change. 




 Cool! So how did it come about? 




  but the fact that women can have their breast out in public but I can't have my penis out in public.

You think that women being able to be topless in public, just as men can (as of the 1930's, I might add), would create an inequality? 




 Proof? 




  but pulling out your breasts for all the world to see is overkill and honestly quite rude.

Do you wear a t-shirt at the beach? 'Cause you've got 'em, too. 




  witty

Doubtful. 




 It's for people like you that I post these things. That's not healthy, and it's not your fault. It's society's.

Well, it's more for the nursing mothers who still have the fear, and the experience, of harassment. But for you, too! 




 Fantastic! I'd love to see more of your work. 




 Probably. This just relates to federal law. Individual state laws would still apply.

I'm not a lawyer, though.  




 Same.  




 This is one of the strongest arguments in favor of legalization. Not only is prohibition completely ineffective (and counter productive), but in leaving everything to the black market and cartels (including revenue), marijuana isn't regulated at all. 




 Here's hoping (against all prior evidence). 




 change it when faced with a good enough reason to do so

Sadly, she only changed her mind when faced with a *personal* reason (her son's medicinal needs for marijuana). The good reasons for legalization have always been there.

I agree with your message, and I certainly applaud this woman for recognizing her mistake and trying to right it, but I don't think she's exactly a role model for open-mindedness. I'm fairly certain she would still be opposing it if she hadn't had that personal experience, like the many conservatives that oppose gay marriage until a member of their family comes out. 




  Just because some senile old woman wants medical marijuana doesn't make it any more stupid.

Did you maybe mean to say "less stupid"? 




  Just not sure why people want to put another poison in their body

You say "another", but the thing is, marijuana is already ubiquitous. Kids often choose weed because it's easier to get than beer. If prohibition worked that would be one thing, but all it does is funnel money to drug dealers, gangs, and ultra violent cartels, instead of into the economy and into the hands of tax payers. It's entirely counterproductive.

And not only is there a ton of weed out there, it's all entirely unregulated. I know a guy that unknowingly smoked some laced with formaldehyde and it really messed him up.

Furthermore, it's rather senseless to prohibit marijuana and not alcohol and tobacco, when the first is far less dangerous (if dangerous at all) than the other two.

I should point out that I've never tried marijuana, and have no plans to even once it's legal, but I push hard for legalization because it would be a really beneficial thing for the country. I agree there are higher priority issues, but prohibition causes some very significant problems (and really doesn't prevent any), so it shouldn't be on the bottom of the list either. The political will is there, and it's something most people agree upon, so let's do it.

**TL;DR** - Keeping marijuana illegal causes some major problems, serves almost no purpose, and is easily corrected, so let's solve the issues we can while we work on the others. 




 What are identify politics? 




 Identity politics?

Also, while the republicans are certainly starting to come on board, it's the democratic party that has been leading the way on legalization. 




 I assumed when it fell that you had just shut off the current. It just did that on its own? 




 Chris Rock? 




 I agree, but this really bothers me. If I tell you something in confidence, and you tell someone else, you've violated the trust that I've placed in you. Who you told isn't a factor. 




 How does this video have 4k upvotes, but only 579 views? 




 Explain? 




 Exactly how I feel. I hope the more open bill passes, but I'll take both over nothing. 




 The first Eastern state to legalize is going to make a ton of money. 




 Edit: You may vote for as many as you want, so you don't have to choose this one over others if you support it.

 If increasing your water intake doesn't help, consider if you're getting enough vitamin D. I used to get soylent headaches very frequently, and adding a vitamin D supplement every few days helped me, and now I almost never get soylent headaches.

 Worry not! You can still watch the show, assuming you can afford [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight) ;). 




 Season 2 just started. 




 I know! I don't have any sort of cable, let alone HBO, and I've seen the main segment of every episode. It's awesome.  




 Yes. Sadly it has like 10 names. I think RCV is the best, as it's the most descriptive, but IRV is a little more accurate. 




 For inherently single-seat races, definitely, though I'd prefer [proportional representation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8XOZJkozfI list=PLqs5ohhass_QZtSkX06DmWOaEaadwmw_D) where possible. 




 Works for me. Try again? 




 Check out WolfPAC. They're doing something about it right now. There are a number of other organizations working towards the goal as well. 




 Even if it were 99%, would you really deny the 1% the medicine they legitimately need just to deny the rest legal access to pot they'd likely have no problem getting illegally? 




 Thanks for pointing that out. Deleted. 




 Amazing what a little competition can bring to a monopolized market. What do they call that, again? Capitalism? 




 Yeah, literally. 




 The manzier! 




 Guys already wear bikini tops on go topless day out of solidarity for women who are still forced to cover up and to protest the double standard. Sends a pretty cool message, I think. 




 The caribou you know are too busy being indicted for tax fraud. 




 That's where I'm at. You can sexualize pretty much any part of the body (legs, abs, etc.). Seems pretty silly to me to arbitrarily hide certain parts. Not only silly, but also counterproductive, as you greatly increase the allure of something by keeping it constantly hidden. 




 Wow. Didn't even think about that. 




 He's probably against people wearing feathers, too, so... 




 Yeah... :( 




 Think we'd be able to tell the difference? 




 This is that. 




 I'd be willing to bet the black market brought in even more the year before, especially since it's still in operation and wasn't heavily taxed and regulated. 




 ? 




 Believe it or not, it used to be illegal for men to be topless in public, too, as recently as the 1930's. I think you wore something akin to a wrestling uniform. 




 As I, and many, many others believe that prohibition is ineffective and counterproductive, yes I do.

Indulge me. Why do you think it should be illegal? 




 No word yet on the state-approved list of garments. 




  The party of small-minded government.

 Why? 




 I wish. The guy also wants to ban yoga pants and beige (skin) colored clothing in public, as well. 




 Without the Alex his opponent was dead to the Abomination. 




 Most of us don't understand it either. It's frustrating, pointless, and harmful on a psychological/emotional level. 




 I was just playing along with the joke... 




 I really hope that you're that guy about everything:

"We're out of mustard."

"This calls for a nude protest." 




 Your name is awesome. "MURGHBURLBUGLBE my dear Watson." 




 Sadly it's 20republicans for the next 2 years. 




 Actually, it used to be illegal for men to be topless in public as recently as the 1930's, if you can believe that. 




 Thank you. It may take us some time to really forgive you, but it's a start. 




 That's where I'm at. I've never used marijuana, and don't intend to even after legalization, but legalization is very important, and if we can get this passed in 2016, it gets us most of what a good legalization bill would, and we can correct it from there.

I know people hate this proposal, and I'd rather see something better passed, too, but I'll take "mostly legal" over "pointlessly  and counter-productively illegal" if that's what we can get. 




 Sure, as long as said settings were appropriate, which is to say anywhere where it would be appropriate for a man to be topless. 




 About 5 years ago I saw my neighbors having sex in the shower with the window wide open. Watched for a couple seconds, thinking if they cared they wouldn't be having sex next to an open window, but then thought "nah, that's not cool", and went to bed. 




 It's a ridiculous double standard that makes absolutely no sense. 




 If the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is going to take the irrevocable step of executing a human being, its capital sentencing system must be infallible."

I agree, and it should only be instated once the system is indeed infallible. Which is to say, never. 




 I bet many do. I'm sure they don't love spending 75% of their time in office raising money for the next term. The democrats will definitely be on board, possibly even a few republicans. 




 Probably because it invariably does. 




 Contact the white house and your federal representatives and express your support. There are also a number organizations, WolfPAC, Mayday.us, and NH Rebellion, to name a few, that are actively working toward this goal (in different ways). Check them out and if you like what you see (WolfPAC's organization is amazing), lend your support to one of them.

Finally, keep an eye on [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik1AK56FtVc).
