 That's how mine occur. During daytime naps. 




 Hell yeah! I was watching that the other day. Awesome thermos. 




 Wth? What are the odds you'd be browsing this thread after that particular comment? 




 Forget reasonably priced, I'd like one to start with. Damn Mississippi is so behind the rest of the country. 




 I haven't read any t replied just yet but I'm gonna say what's probably been said, time machine or a device to simply alter the speed of time. 




 KFC double down isn't available here, such sad. So much sad. 




 I love the peanut butter twix 




 I buy em here in Cleveland MS all the time.  




 I do this. Idc who watches. Be jealous.

 I've got my bed next to my computer desk and my desk is at the right height so my computer is perfectly level. My tv is a few feet from the foot of my bed. Talk about perfect laziness. All my favorite movies and shows are on my computer which is connected to my Blu-ray so I don't have to even get up to change the movie. Ultimate laziness. I even keep a couple snacks and bottled beverages bedside. 




 I'd buy $100m worth of bacon and burn it on live cam and upload it all over the net. 




 Not if he finds this and knows it's you. 




 About once a month or so, I have a recurring dream. Though all the details aren't exactly the same, the main plot is. The dream: I'll be minding my business going along dream world doing whatever when all of a sudden I'm a couple feet off the floor just floating there. I can control where I float to pretty easily. I'll usually float around for a few minutes enjoying myself. After a while a sudden blanket of fear over comes me. The only sound I can make is a wailing banshee or ghost like sound. I hear it in my dream and out loud. My wife wakes me up because it freaks her out. By the way, I can not mimic the sound while I'm awake, it's a way higher pitched sound than I can consciously make. My question to you Reddit is can anyone help me understand what could possibly be going on? Also, has anyone of you experienced anything similar? 




 Anna Gunn. Why not?  




 "White's only pies!"+ runs and eats scalding hot pie. 




 I had one of those blow up pillow fight things or whatever. You put your fist in and beat each other senseless. I immediately felt regretful. 









 I believe I have something like that in both my ears 




 All I can say about most of this is, yes some customers are dicks. The thing is most of you are complaining about customers doing regular customer stuff. Customers have every right to pay with whatever method the store promises to accept. Customers shouldn't put money in their mouths out bras or whatever it's gross. If a customer wants to use a coupon that isn't expired and they have the product the coupon promises to cover, then you can't be mad at a customer for holding up the line. It's not the customer's fault if some stores punish cashiers for slow time. A lot of the comments on here are ridiculous. Maybe you should find a different job. I worked retail and ran into the same stuff. What was different for me? I actually know how to work in retail. Stop complaining about customers being customers. That's like saying babies shouldn't cry or dogs shouldn't bark. If a price rings up wrong and a customer complains about it there is a great chance they aren't accusing you off fixing the wrong price they are being human and just blaming the nearest person. Not everyone that comes through your line thinks like you. Some of your customers have never worked retail, they only know what it's like to be a customer. You find certain things to be "simple" or "common sense" but that's because you're around it all the time. I bet some of your cruddy customers find other things to be "simple" or "common sense" that you might not immediately do the same wary they do. Customers are the reason your job exists. 




 People are stupid. That's what self check out is for. ;-) 




 Not everyone can see well enough to see the menu board until they reach the front. Though I do understand the frustration. 




 Not sure if it's been said but seems like a drop off intended for someone else to find. Maybe it's been too long since breaking bad ended. Either way, pretty cool. 




 That's that hurry up and wait mentality that I miss. 














 I would also have been scared if an Apple iPhone was crawling out of a sewage grate too. 




 I still would love to know how I make driving annoying when he is the one who can't follow the laws and almost caused an accident 




 Because he was in the right by running a stop sign right? 




 I have plenty victories i just don't like being cut off and almost being rear ended when he should have stopped like he was supposed to by law 




 I wasn't in a hurry due to being late i was 30 minutes early. I just didn't want to wait for the last minute to clock in 




 It was a school bus without passengers. You should have read everything 




 Darn it sucks you think it's lame jcravenw, because I posted this just for you. Simple does not equal lame. 




 The taco shell was lop sided 




 Also my thanks was more of a "I'm glad someone else enjoyed one of my all time favorites.  




 I wasn't taking someone else's credit. Like I said. I've not seen it on here so I had no one to credit on here. I've been telling that joke for years. 




 It's a joke. If you don't understand that then maybe you just need to unsubscribe. 




 I don't look at r/jokes all the time. Actually the day I posted that joke was day one. I don't know anyone who looks for the content they're about to post to see if it might be a repost. Plus just because you've seen it doesn't mean everyone has. Reposts give new subbers like me a chance to see the content. 




 Hr ripped someone off. He doesn't want his son to think it's okay to do that. 




 Thanks 




 Little Johnny likes playing hooky quite often and he hides in his mom's closet until she takes a nap. One day he plays hooky as usual but today a strange guy comes over and he and Johnny's mom have sex. Right as they're finishing up johnny's dad comes home early so the man hides in the closet. The following conversation occurs:
"It's dark in here, huh?"
Shut up kid, I'm hiding.
"Wanna buy my baseball?"
No, shut up!
"I'm gonna tell my daddy on you for what you were doing to my mom"
Fine! I'll buy the damn ball if you shut up. How much?
" 300 dollars"
No way I'm paying that much!
" I'm gonna tell"
Fine, ya rip off! Here.

They swap the money and the ball.

A few days later the strange guy is back at it and Johnny's dad comes home early again and the guy hides in the closet again. The following conversation occurs:
"It's dark in here huh?"
Yeah. Shut up.
" wanna buy a baseball glove?"
No. Not this time.
"I'll tell daddy"
Fine. How much?
" 700 dollars"
No way!
"Yes or I'm gonna scream"

Needless to say, they swap cash for glove.

The next day Johnny's dad asks him if he wants to play catch. Johnny says "that'll be hard to do without my ball and glove." And his dad asks what happened to it. Johnny explains he sold them for $1000.
Infuriated, his dad brings him to church to confess.
He puts Johnny in the booth and the following conversation occurs:
" it's dark in here huh?"
Don't start that shit again you little rip off! 




 Lol. I thought I was the only one. I also put my sack of fast food on there to keep it warm. 









 Yes. Mine is active anywhere there are a mass of people that I don't know. Like if I go to taco bell and the lobby is  full of people particularly in line. I just leave. So yes, a church or a library would trigger it. 




 Oh and I understand "tit for tat" quite well. I grew up with petty siblings, lol. 




 Well I'm glad you've done your research. I'm also glad you've found peace. I just don't see it happening for me. I panic in crowds and that panic makes me frustrated. I will probably live the rest of my life this way. Thanks for the concern. Oh and I am aware that my response isn't much but if I yawn one more time I won't be capable of seeing through my watery eyes. 




 Thanks for the kind words but I never mentioned hating anyone. I hate eating around big groups of people or being around big groups of people. I have been diagnosed with social anxiety. 




 I get the same way. It's like I'd rather die of utter starvation than to be around a bunch of people. I don't care what it is, I wont eat it if there are people (especially ones I don't know or rarely see). I'll be thinking "Ooh there's cake.... *goes to get cake* wait, there's people.. lots and lots of people... fuck it, there's a slight chance there'll be some left" to myself "RETREAT!"
