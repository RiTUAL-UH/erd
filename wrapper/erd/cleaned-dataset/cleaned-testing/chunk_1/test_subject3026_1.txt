I love the guns, the vehicles wouldnt work.. especially the half track which is way OP. But the guns rock and are loud and scary.

here is a couple crappy screen shots.. It is nice not having modern weaponry. [Cant get some of the picts to upload to imgur for the life of me but this gives ya the gist.](http://imgur.com/a/Ct5mH#0) 










































































 I'm guessing they call them drip tips because the hole is big enough to drip some juice down onto the wick?

well I am perfectly happy to unscrew at time I want to drip a flavor or w/e on top.

What I dont like is juice in the mouth.. and well as tanks empty we tend to tip up. i sometimes put a piece of q-tip in the end.. but that only works for a minute or two before it is saturated and started to make it hard to draw.

anyways all i see are drip tips.. any non drip tips out there?
