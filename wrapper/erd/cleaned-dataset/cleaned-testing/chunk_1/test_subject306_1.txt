 During my broke days in college, I tried duplicating this, buying Eggo Waffles and KFC.  It satisfied the craving, but I doubt I'd ever do it again.  




 Damn I miss Josh Morgan 




 Depends on your tone and your approach.  I read your sentence in 2 voices.  Creepy gay stalker voice, and regular voice.  That being said, it's a compliment, but the creepy voice can easily jar anyone.   




 Came here to add the same thought.  Japanese love KFC, but they make it sound like it's the norm for Xmas.  A few weeks there was a similar website where they listed breakfast from all over the world.  They put tofu as a breakfast item for Japanese.  Not even clos 




 I can't say with confidence that Alex is good enough to take us all the way.  Same can be said that if we find ourselves in a shootout where we have to air it out, I'm not confident of resting the game on Alex's arm.  Of course the O-line needs to improve as well, but if there is a free agent QB that's available I'd like to see us pick him up.  The playbook is only 1/2 open, let's go full playbook and see what happens.   




 Congratulations, enjoy!   




 The power of Reddit, helping hemophiliacs one day at a time.  Update:  I since have spoken to our fellow bleeder, and am trying to get him hooked up with Baxter.  Baxter was actually in our office the other day and this story was brought to their attention.  They're trying to take action immediately.  Btw, were you at Chicago for the Annual Meeting back in Nov?   




 Grades might not be the best motivator for learning, but as a whole we've taken out the concept of competition + challenge.  Now this might be due to the fact I grew up in a Asian house hold where grades were the end all be all.  But I notice these days, we coddle our children too much where there are no losers.  Watch this piece on 60 min about "Millenials"  and you'll see the result happening.  (http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/08/60minutes/main3475200.shtml)

The motivation has to come from parents, but grades can be a motivational booster.  Who doesn't want to score the least amongst your friends in class?  It's competition, something we've abandoned and have now let kids feel entitled.

 Here's my St. Patty's Day tradition.  Pick up a 4 pack of Guinness.  Pour 2 cans, (1 is not enough) along with the other herbs, and such.  Add only a bit of water, you want the Guinness to reduce.  Simmer for 3-4 hours till tender.  

As for the cabbage part, I like doing with a modern twist.  Slice cabbage and saute in olive oil, S+P.  Meanwhile reduce some balsamic vinegar til reduces and becomes a syrup.  Drizzle balsamic over cabbage, drink the other 2 Guinness and begin bar hopping.

 You're in luck pal, I work for the National Hemophilia Foundation in NYC.  I just happened to be browsing Reddit when I came across your post.  Ironically I'm watching football with the CEO of the foundation right now.  
Give me a call tomorrow 212.328.3756.  Ask for Z, and we'll go from there.  

Quick questions, what state are you in?  We'll get you hooked up.  Call! 




 Right because clearly he's hurting that bad where posting on Reddit asking for amateur medical opinions is far more wise than going to the ER.    




 Obviously you post on Reddit because its the smart thing to do.  And there's this thing called google which can answer a lot of your questions.  But that would make too much sense  




 As much all of this is true, they are by far the most talented street musicians I've seen worldwide.

 Go Teblow yourself 




 and special teams an aspect of football often forgotten/neglected 




 And Seattle beat the Ravens also 




 You're question is 2 part.  #1, 49ers are contenders.  Week in and week out we play competitively, enough to make the game close.  

Which leads to #2.  Alex Smith IS not the 49ers.  He's not greatest, we put him in situations that'll help us win.  Call it what you want, he manages the games and he makes enough plays.  But our Defense is legit, enough to be considered a contender.  Our special teams is elite, and our Run Offense is one of the best.  All those make the 49ers contenders.  If you don't agree then you're watching another type of football.  

Stop trolling.   




 "Japan is a few steps further away than most cultures"  What the fuck does that even mean?  Stating long nuanced analysis of Japanese culture isn't a thing if you yourself aren't coming from the correct standpoint.

 Same style vid as the 2 that beat up the mentally ill woman in Sac.  What do they both have in common?  You can sit here and say punks are punks across the world, but I'm seeing a trend and witness more of it each day.   




 Went to Hawaii for a friends wedding, she forgot her makeup in my friends car.  Refused to come to the wedding bc she didnt have make up even though my friend promised to bring the kit before the wedding.  During the wedding she acted like a complete ass.   




 Huge difference between your GF is hot, and I wanna date her.   




 Exactly this, bc as the friend, I'd wonder if he was checking out my girl the whole time.   




 How good of a friend is he?  Ask yourself, is this girl that awesome where you're willing to risk it all?  Just remember, you might be running the risk of ruining the friendship even by asking him if it's Ok.

 McDonald's Worker holding a metal rod 




 I was at The Venitian in Las Vegas for a bachelor party.  A bunch of us were partying in the room with strippers, booze, drugs.  
The strippers weren't the hottest, and their attitude really sucked.  They were demanding $$$ for bullshit, for instance 50.00 per dance, 100.00 for their clothes off.  We got sick of them quick and kicked them out.  That pissed them off because a few minutes later, security knocked on the door.  They forced their way in, and raided the place.  5 ginourmous guards stormed in shouting at us demanding to show us where to drugs were.  Luckily we flushed the coke, but couldn't hide the weed.  
They found the OZ of weed, took all our pics with us holding our drivers license, and that's why I can never step foot in the Venitian again.  




 I actually got a massage there, totally legit and prices are solid.  It's the neon lighting that gives it that "shady" look

 Mind Blown 




 Throughout my years of smoking, I've always kept the same philosophy, which is, "It always evens out at the end"  

To this day, I still swear by it.  People have hooked me up, I've hooked them up.  This guy sounds like he's keeping tabs on everything.  If he's keeping tabs on silly things such as trees, imagine if you're in a situation where he's really got you.  No need for people such as him in your life.  
You already know the answer.   




 Anything that involves being creative, for me it's  breaking, playing music and cooking.  I don't get to do it all the time, but when I do it brings me to a happy place.   




 I bet they had some "intense debriefings"   









 Yeah not recommended for people who can't deal with crowds or stuffy areas, which it becomes around 2 am 




 Never offensive.  I'm thinking of picking up a McDonald's T shirt, and a fake metal rod?  Too soon?

 It's prob the one where the guy comes home for the holidays, brews a cup of coffee and everyone in the house wakes up all smiley and shit.  Mom comes down the stairs and little sis runs up and hugs him.  Tear jerker 









 My thoughts are very raw on this matter.  Just a few weeks ago, the whole city commemorated 9/11, by remembering the brave fireman, cops, citizens etc.  There was a feeling of peace, respect, and more importantly UNITY.  The whole world watched as we mourned and came together as a city.   
Fast forward to Occupy Wall Street, and it's like we took a 180 degree turn.  Now don't get me wrong, I am in full support of the protests, and hope their voice is heard globally.  And yes, the COPS fucked up on this.     
Having lived in NYC for 2 years now, I've concluded NYPD is a bunch of assholes, and there is almost a sort of pedestal these guys expect to be on after 9/11.  Now after this last incident, they're rep is back to being shit, and there's a feeling of "Us vs Them"  
As a society, when 9/11 comes around again next year do we all have pity and bow our heads to pay respects to Cops?  This ass backwards behavior US has is least surprising IMO.  And once again the whole world watches as we collide and crash against each other, making us look juvenile and incapable of handling crisis.  









 Older bro and I argued over a stupid cartoon.  The end result was him wrestling me to the ground and breaking my wrist.  
Another was when he stole money from dad's wallet and denied he ever did it, resulting in me getting whooped and him watching the entire time without saying a word.  So what's some of your f'd up stories?   














 I've actually posted once about her before, she came into work for 2 weeks coughing and sneezing, refusing to take time off (which is BS)  By no means am I a germaphobe, but she's just down right gross to me.  Looks, personality, and now hygiene.  I feel like fingernails is crossing the line.    Thoughts?   




 Miami Reddit-

Any spots to recommend where people really dance (as in breaking or, house)?  Coming from NYC, and have heard great things about the parties here.  Cheers!

 I'm always curious of the person next to me, if they know what the fuck they're doing.  I'm a program manager for a national non profit, which I've been doing for the past 15 years.  Quite frankly, I can do my job with my eyes closed.  Am I content?  No, but I'm striving to do better.  How bout you guys?   




 When guy a guys down on you, have your legs ever quivered?  And I mean shake...If so, was it a mix of, you were super turned on, and you were into the guy?  Or were you simply just horny, and the guy was doing all the right things?  

I'm trying to gather info on a rather confusing turn of events.

 Not literally...

Usually my approach has been direct, sometimes too much. The way I see it, if the girl bites then game one. There are times it gives off the relationship vibe too early, which has come back to bite me in the ass. How do I change this up so I can still appear interested without giving away too much? The backstory to this was that I met a amazing girl that just got out of a relationship. I tried taking the slow route, but it ended up backfiring. And I knew she was into me.

She's turning 28 next month, I'm 33. I'm pretty blunt usually, sometimes too straight forward. It kinda got awkward with the last girl, but at least it cuts the BS. I also wear my emotions on my sleeve, good or bad.

 **Backstory**I met a awesome girl recently at a friends house. The only kicker was that her and her bf just broke up recently. I was getting the vibe the whole time we hung out, so I thought. A few weeks ago I got enough brave juice in me to ask her out, she said yes and the following weekend we hung out the whole time.

Knowing she's still fresh out, I acted my best and did not push at all. Ironically, this back fired as she made the move on me. We hooked up, things were great. I thought it was a amazing weekend, shared stories, similar upbringings, partied, laughed..everything.

So then a few weeks pass by, we talk on the phone briefly, was kinda awkward but didnt' think much. Then 2 days ago she asked me out, only to bail on me later. Today I get email saying she only wants to be friends. So with the info at hand, was I the "getting over my ex" booty call?

The only thing I can think of is that I might've given off more a relationship vibe than anything else. I did make her a mix cd, and a short story I wrote. I figured it was a worthy gamble. Also all this happened in NYC, a city unlike any other, where dating can be absolutely amazing or fucked. Often times in 1 week!
TL;DR Met a amazing girl that just broke up with her bf, I hook up with her although I didn't make the first move. Developed feelings, now she wants to be friends.   



















 A few weeks ago I met someone amazing (the white rhino), you know the kind where you can't stop thinking of them, that rare beauty you run into once every few years.  
We've hung out a few times, nothing serious, but I've been getting the good vibe overall.  She even informed me things weren't going well with her bf, and sounded as though things were going to end. (I didnt even ask her) Last time she even said, "I probably won't be talking to him" 
So last nite I finally summoned up the courage to ask her out. Although it didn't come out the smoothest, I still put it out there.  She responded, "I'm still with him..trying to work things out."  I asked how that was going, and all she said was "it's going"...Of course I tried to play it cool, and told her to let me know if anything changes.  
My question fellow Redditors.  I can handle the rejection, but was I missing some huge sign that I wasn't aware of.  Was this a flat out no, or do I still have a shot in the long term?  

 




 The backstory:  I recently met someone pretty amazing, we've hung out a few times so far, and my gut is telling me she likes me.  We went out last night, got pretty buzzed, danced alot.  I went home and ended up drunk texting her.  Nothing insane was written, but I did say I want to hear her story over dinner sometime.  I woke up today realizing what I did, immediately regretting it.  Sorta chickened out I feel like.  I feel like I might've killed any momentum, and she hasn't texted back a reply.

 The backstory:  A good friend of mine passed away in Dec due to cardiac arrest, he had pulmonary hypertension.  (33 y.o)  Three years ago, he met the love of his life, until the dumb whore went to Costa Rica and cheated on him.  The bitch got pregnant as well.  When she came back, she moved out of his apt and out of his life.  Fast forward today:  My friend's facebook page is still up and running, (his parents decided to keep it) people like to leave messages, posts, pics etc.  

Out of nowhere, this girl comes out of the woodworks and starts posting.  Everyday it's something, "I miss your touch, smile..."  Yada yada yada...Attention starving whore

Bottom line it's pissing me off now.  Only a few of us knew she cheated on him, everyone else thinks she's some sweet gal.  Out of respect for his FB page, I'm not going to bust her out.  But I can send her a message.  I need input on this.  Call me out if I'm accused of being a troll.  

TL;DR:  A girl who cheated on my friend who passed away is leaving annoying Facebook posts on his page.  I can see thru her B.S.  What should I do?   




 Last nite I began to feel the onset of a cold.  Nothing serious.  Went out for drinks which consisted of Jameson shots, 2 Stellas, and Henneseey with Ginger Ale.  Fast forward today, I feel fine.  I've done this a few times and it works.  My theory is, either I piss out everything, or the internal body temperature kills whatever strain it was.

 I work in a typical office, cubicle style.  The last 2 days the girl next to me has been hackin 24-7, to the point where it's annoying to hear, and it's kinda nasty.  By no means am I a germaphobe, I'm just trying not to get sick.  Is it wrong to go up and ask/tell her to go home?  What's your stance on this?  BTW, the excuse of I don't want to use PTO/or Sick days is BS.   



















 We've been living in Brooklyn for the past year and have seen/done most of the city.  As exciting as it is, everything kinda looks and feels familiar after awhile.  
Where are some original places in Manhattan to take her?  Japanese Restaurants, bars, speakeasy's etc.  Please no east village, SOHO, greenwich.  Thanks
