 Easily my favorite song by Tool 




 Heard a rumor that they are in the studio and a new record will be out sometime towards the middlenof next summer 




 You can never be too prepared 




 House of Pies in Houston, Tx? 




 After accidentally pissing on my Xbox and Nes while sleep/drunk/blacked out, a package arrived on my doorstep. It was a brand new Xbox slim 250gb. A few days later another box arrived. It was a Nes still in the original box!! 




 Easily one of the most frustrating things about a relationship 




 I got a lot of weird looks when I busted out laughing in the middle of the laundromat. . 




 I work in at a dueling piano bar and I usually miss everything that happens there. But on this night I got to see two sets of tits. One from a girl who wanted free drinks from me (she didn't get it this isn't r/gonewild ) and the other because some dude convinced her that it was a good idea to show the bartenders her boobs before they take a shot as some sort of "good luck" act. Either both were nice and made my night! 




 Try again 




 Customer's tits, two sets actually 









 That is fantastic!  You did a badass cover!
