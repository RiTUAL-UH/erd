 Wow... That was uncalled for. 




 How do we escape? 




 Lock your door like everyone says and hope he isn't in there with you. Definitely call the police AND let someone close to you know what's going on, a friend or a parent, etc. The likelihood is that this is someone you know what messing with you, hence the Lulu. But it would be stupid to take any chances.

tl;dr hide and call the fucking police asap 




 Am I missing something? Yes, relatives can be strange but what are you trying to convey. 




 Straight up man you need to call a priest or an exorcist or a ghidt hunter something along those lines. If your parents don't believe you there are two options: 1) Explain the whole ordeal to your parents WITH your siblings and say all you want is to call a priest etc to ease the nervousness. 2) do olit behind their backs when they aren't home or something.

Either way you have to do it.
Good luck OP. 




 Definitely anything by Christopher. Nympho is especially good.

Also, can someone make this playlist on a different service like 8tracks as Spotify isn't available in every country? :) 




 Sorry, everybody I no longer have anymore Aviate invites. However, I will keep this post up in hopes that some others will have a spares. I'm really sorry to anyone who I didn't get to! x 




 shoot me a pm with your email, or comment on my post about invites and i'd love to! 




 I just got Aviate and I have 5 invites for anyone who wants them. Just shoot me a PM or comment your email! All I ask is you return the favor for any other redditors who need it. Maybe we could start a bit of a chain? 

P.S. Aviate is great, I highly recommend it! If you're sort of on the fence about getting it or not, I suggest trying it out for a few days, it really helps to have everything laid out as simply as it is. Good luck new Aviators!
