 "Sorry dad, my fucking dumbass friend changed the url when I got up to use the bathroom"

Come on OP 




 Hi!  I have several pets on side accounts that I want to show off on my main account userlookup, but I'd like a lookup that was possibly kind of designed with this in mind?  Anybody know of any? 




 If you feed a pet at movie central when it is bloated:

You will get the 'very bloated' status.  That should make it easier to get leftovers, or so I've heard. 




 Nice zap!  I'm working on zapping a poogle MSP on TWO accounts and it's not going so well  x_x  pray neoluck for me as well!
