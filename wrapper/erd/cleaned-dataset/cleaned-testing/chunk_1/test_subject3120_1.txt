 There will be no collapse.  AT least not in the way you imagine it.  It's not going to be like "Dawn of the Dead" where suddenly chaos erupts everywhere, and the preppers grab their bugout bags and go in the woods.  The ongoing zeitgeist that one day lightning will strike and the proles will rise up is another method of control.  It's far more insidious than that.  Read "The Hollow Men" by TS Eliot and you'll understand.

You'll just notice that every day things will become a little more expensive.  Prices will go up and down, but this constant will always remain: you will need to work longer for less and less.  Young people finishing college will be told at their graduation that "The only way to the top is to start at the bottom," only to see the bottom get lower and lower every year.  Job security will cease to exist as a concept.  YOu'll notice the size of houses and apartments will begin to shrink whilst the price of housing rises.  More and more it will become challenging to find food that doesn't taste rather bland.  You'll see your friends and family less, and one day find that doesn't bother you much.  Marriage will become rare, as will children.  People will begin to indulge themselves in digital fantasies, never actually experiencing the real world.  The modern human will have no religion.  No dreams.  No desires or wants beyond the immediate sating of his bodily desires.  No beliefs beyond the arithmetic (and even that will become a grey area).  One day, still many generations from now, your descendant will walk into a voting booth, and there will be a single choice for him to checK: "Yes."  And every day he will be told from the moment he wakes up to the moment he sleeps, "You are stupid, you are ugly, you are weak.  But together we are free, prosperous, and strong."

That is the true nature of the collapse: the reduction of the modern American man to a feudal serf, incapable of feeling love or hate, and unable to recognize his own self-worth.

 Has this been in planning since Obama was elected?  Just recently there has been a huge political push to overthrow the United States government by its own members, and high ranking members of other nations. Obama has "failed" the military industrial complex by recalling troops from the Middle East and by not sending in troops during the "Syria chemical weapons" debacle, and Obama has "failed" Israel by not being more firm with Iran. Saudi Arabia is at risk of being exposed as a direct financial supporter of the 9/11 attacks, and Rand Paul had a speech about how Saudi Arabia is no longer an ally of the United States.

Netanyahu has been working directly with members of the US congress in an effort to overthrow Obama.

"Why am I going to Washington? Because, as prime minister of Israel, its my obligation to do everything in my power to prevent the conclusion of a bad deal that could threaten the survival of the State of Israel. "

This means that Netanyahu doesn't believe Obama is working in the best interest of Israel, so he's working directly with members of congress to ensure that something happens to change that fact.

Rudy Giuliani, who was in on the 9/11 attacks, has directly attacked Obama

Rudy Giuliani: Obama doesn't love America

Giuliani, a lapdog, has been making a big scene about Obama. Conservatives love Giuliani and believe everything he says. 

Giuliani states that Obama was influenced by Communists
http://nypost.com/2015/02/21/giuliani-obama-influenced-by-communists-since-youth/

Rudy Giuliani doubled down on his claims that President Obama doesnt love America in an interview with The Post Friday  claiming the commander-in-chief has been influenced by communists since his youth.

DHS intelligence report warns of domestic right-wing terror threat 
http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/19/politics/terror-threat-homeland-security/

They're carrying out sporadic terror attacks on police, have threatened attacks on government buildings and reject government authority.

The DHS was given unlimited power after the events of 9/11. Saudi Arabia has been linked with al-Qaida and the American public wants the "missing" 28 pages of the 9/11 commission reports to be declassified. Netanyahu has stated that 9/11 was very beneficial to Israel. These entities are trying to overthrow Obama and take control of America. Expect a false flag attack in the coming weeks, if not sooner. Afterwards the DHS will launch their plan to incarcerate any that oppose the coup.
