 I'm betting they have one or two customers who get kicks from making trouble that way. Power law and all that. 




 Efficiency = 100%-(# of pregnancies/user population) over a certain time period, some number of years. You and your GF are one data point, not the whole equation. 




 She's his punishment?

 First thing I noticed was that I was going home with my mom even though I'd gone to the party with my dad. 




 I had a fear of hurdles, but I got over it. 




 Several years ago? I saw him with this setup a couple of months ago.  




 It's not private property, it's a public highway whose administration is contracted out to a private company. 




 You might try Hancock Center, 41st and Red River, or that shopping center with the Target on Cameron Road north of 51st. 




 I've always said Kansas is just Texas without the food, music, or self-esteem.

 You learned to sew and cook women? What a strange school. 




 Also: I know someone who tried a vegan diet and actually gained weight; you have to be sure you're not eating a lot of fatty foods such as nuts and avocado, or sweets. 




 They generally don't; it would give the fries an unwelcome flavor. 

But you may not know what's in the oil itself (could be part animal fat) or the processing; McDonald's used to use beef tallow on its fries, don't know if it still does.

 Some deeds include mineral rights, some don't. A previous owner of your property might have sold them off. 




 Midland and Odessa are towns in the middle of nowhere, and those rents are comparable to what you'd pay in Austin.

For comparison, [here's](http://amarillo.craigslist.org/search/apa?catAbb=apa query= zoomToPosting= minAsk= maxAsk= bedrooms=1 housing_type=) what rents are like in Amarillo -- about 50% lower. 




 Thank you for doing this AMA. You might like this little Christmas story.

About 10 years ago about this time of year, I was visiting my mother in New York City. In December, tree vendors drive to the city from New England and other places, each with a truck full of trees, and set up shop at curbsides all over the city, selling their trees till they run out. 

My mother has a small apartment and doesn't normally get a tree. One day I was walking past a tree seller and saw that he had taken some little branches about a foot or so long that had fallen from the larger trees, stuck each one into a piece of wood for a base, and put them next to a sign that said "Charlie Brown trees, $3." Naturally I couldn't resist, so I bought one and took it home, and my mother loved it. It stayed healthy-looking through the holidays. 

So thanks to you and your husband for this and other additions to our culture. 




 We say there's nothing between Canada and Texas except a barbed-wire fence somewhere around Kansas. North Texas (where Fort Worth is) and, especially, the Panhandle get winter weather. Not as much as PA, but some. 




 a.k.a. canola oil. It's OK for massages. 




 The main difference is cost and the feeling you got a task-specific tool. Coconut oil is as good as anything with "massage" on the label. 




 Other good massage oils, besides coconut, are sweet almond oil and (my favorite) grapeseed oil. The expensive massage oils at the store are just something mundane like almond oil with some blend of scents; it's easy to duplicate at home for a fraction of the cost. 




 I love it when a flan comes together. 









 Hi, I'm Sess. 




 Wibbly-wobbly ... timey-wimey  ... stuff. 




 Subtracting x/4 from both sides of the equation. x - x/4 = (3/4)x.

 Bread and butthurt. 




 Someone once said, "Shakespeare's work was written by someone else of the same name." 




 For your FYI. 




 Or, figuring partner is unlikely to have the right hand for slam, overcall 1D then bid 4S, choice of games. 




 On it. 









 [This article](http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/book-of-lamentations/) suggests that Adorno's *Minima Moralia* can be read as dystopian literature. It gets better from there. 




 Scandinavia, looks like. 




 Like All The Things! 




 And then he did his taxes. 




 50 here. I figured out early on that I lack the patience for having kids, and never really felt the urge. I like that I can make decisions that affect only me -- I've made good and bad, but the bad ones only hurt myself. No regrets. These are my priorities and mine alone; if yours are different, I'm behind you 100%. I'm happy to leave the child-rearing to people who want to do it and are reasonably good at it. 




 Only six more weeks of summer! 




 They have the Internet on computers now. 




 Meh, not worth getting het up over. 




 I picked up a futon from the curb a few months ago. It was white, not black, so I could easily check it for bad fluids; found none. Excellent condition including the frame. Someone in that building had been putting nice furniture out by the curb a couple of times a year, no idea why.  




 But the worst World Cup in history isn't scheduled for 2014 or 2018, it's scheduled for 2022. So it makes perfect sense to focus special attention on the people who'll get screwed that year. 




 The scariest part is that those two huge scoops of ice cream with sprinkles and so forth are supposed to be a kid's portion. 




 I've always found it bizarre that a song about a free-spirited woman got turned into a line dance. 




 Details. I hate them. I hate ALL of them. 




 ... which makes the OP's spoof of conspiracy theorists even more on target. 




 I had the same vibe and I only know a couple of Mormons. Of course one of them has four kids, all sons about the same ages as the kids in the pic, so it was a natural connection.  




 Years ago there was a guy in my city who liked to dress up as Waldo whenever there was some big thing going on, and just walk around in the crowd. This just made me think of that. I thought he was awesome. 




 "We ran 19 other tests on the data before we found one significant at 95% confidence level." 









 There are 10 types of people in the world: Those who understand statistics, and those who don't, +/- 8. 




 You can grow lumber; you can't grow bricks. That and some other factors make brick etc. comparatively expensive. And really, lumber is fine considering how rare these destructive storms are. 




 I've been friends with Kaylie's family for some time. This is a difficult situation. The guy they arrested has a history of violence and mental illness, from what I've read. 

More info from a nearby newspaper. This story is a day old, but it has a lot of the backstory. http://www.kansascity.com/2013/05/10/4228677/search-resumes-near-ottawa-for.html 




 The sideways emoticon is the best part.
