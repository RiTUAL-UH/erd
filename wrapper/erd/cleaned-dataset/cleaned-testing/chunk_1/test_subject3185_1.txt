 That user tried to give a technical argument.  He argued that the military like reddit AND the military internet traffic is routed through Eglin.   This does not spoil a theory of the military manipulating reddit.  It just means that there is no proof.  




 Is it not completely logical that they would do something like this?  Do you really think that the military would allow users to browse the internet using IP addresses traceable to geolocations ?  It could be used by an enemy to give away the position of their troops and other useful intelligence.  There are countless other security reasons that they would route military internet traffic through central hubs on a VPN and not just allow everyone to connect direct using the local ISP.  

I'm not precluding anything dodgy going on but the explanation given is a reasonable basis on which to start theories. 









 This is one way I see them of handling the crisis.

Not seen many develop the theory.

However, ideas and rumours are making it to the news

If not war in the middle east, then some other world event to knock oil prices up.   N Korea?

Anyone else seeing such coverage or ideas?  Some dismiss it as anti-putin propaganda but I think it makes sense for some kind of covert provocation to rattle markets  and increase oil futures. 




 It is just how i see military logic panning out.  They got got some dangerous people there but they do not have the political will to keep them there.  So you got to wonder what options they consider.  Discussion of "criminals" implies a justice system.  Gitmo is outside of that.   









 I don't see how it affects peoples view of SOPA.     In fact people are going to be more in favor of piracy if corporations or goverments  are going to restrict what gets broadcast. 




 


Strange thing that happened in the heart of the U.S., the ill-famed cesspool of injustice, is now afloat in the world as shocking news.

The Sony Pictures Entertainment, the biggest movie producer in the U.S., which produced the undesirable reactionary film "The Interview" daring hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and agitating even terrorism and had a plan to distribute it, was exposed to surprisingly sophisticated, destructive and threatening cyber warfare and has been thrown into a bottomless quagmire after suffering property losses worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

The public in the U.S. is now describing this case as "disgrace suffered by Sony Pictures Entertainment," "very sorry thing caused by the U.S.," "Sony Pictures Entertainment showing a white flag before hackers" and the "unprecedented disaster suffered by the U.S."

Those who meted out a stern punishment of justice were reported to be cyber experts styling themselves "guardians of peace".

Seized with terrible horror and threat in face of their merciless hacking attack in retaliation against unjust actions, many movie and drama distributors in North America including 41 states of the U.S. and Canada immediately canceled the screening of the reactionary movie. And it was reported that the Sony Pictures Entertainment which directly sponsored its production and distribution hastily issued a statement on Dec. 25 that it would suspend the screening of the undesirable movie which had been planned in 63 countries.

The NDC of the DPRK highly estimates the righteous action taken by the "guardians of peace," though it is not aware of their residence.

It, at the same time, considers as fortunate the step taken by the Sony Pictures Entertainment to give up the overall distribution of the above-said movie due to the decision and strong pressure of the movie and drama distributors for stopping the screening of the reactionary movie, though belatedly.

This is an official stand of the army and the people of the DPRK on what happened in the heart of the U.S.

This stand is taken by the DPRK because the movie "The Interview" is an undesirable and reactionary one justifying and inciting terrorism which should not be allowed in any country and any region.

Another reason is that the movie is run through with a story agitating a vicious and dastardly method of assassinating a head of a legitimate sovereign state.

No wonder, even political and social circles of the U.S. commented that it is quite wrong to defame the head of the state for the mere reason that his politics is different from that of the U.S. and it is in the hostile relationship with the latter and, therefore, the Sony Pictures Entertainment got into a serious trouble and paid a due price.

For these reasons, the DPRK is more highly praising the "guardians of peace" for their righteous deed which prevented in advance the evil cycle of retaliation-- terrorism sparks terrorism.

It is quite natural that the movie and drama producers should refrain from undesirable deeds contrary to the noble mission to lead morality and civilization.

But what matters is that the U.S. and its followers are groundlessly trumpeting that the recent cyber attack was made by the DPRK.

The FBI issued the results of the investigation into the hack at the Sony Pictures Entertainment on December 19.

According to them, it suffered tremendous losses.

One may say this is the due price incurred by wrong deed, the evil act of hurting others.

The U.S. released a statement asserting that this loss was caused by the DPRK.

No matter how big and disgraceful the loss may be, the U.S. should not pull up others for no reason.

The FBI presented a report on the results of technical analysis of hacking program used by the "guardians of peace" for this attack, citing it as the ground that the serious hacking was caused by the DPRK.

The report says the malignant code had access to north Korea's IP already known several times and the hacking methods applied in the "March 20 hacking case" and during cyber warfare against media and various other computer networks in south Korea in recent years are similar to that applied against the Sony Pictures Entertainment this time, being another ground that "this was done by the north".

The report, in particular, adds that the malignant code and algorithm applied during the attack are similar to what was used during the hacking attack on south Korea, citing it as a proof.

Not satisfied with those groundless "evidence", the FBI is letting loose ambiguous remarks that it is hard to fully prove due to the "protection of sensitive information sources."

This means self-acknowledgement that the "assertion about the north's deed" came from an intentional allegation rather than scientific evidence.

It is a common sense that the method of cyber warfare is almost similar worldwide. Different sorts of hacking programs and codes are used in cyberspace.

If somebody used U.S.-made hacking programs and codes and applied their instruction or encoding method, perhaps, the "wise" FBI, too, could not but admit that it would be hard to decisively assert that the attack was done by the U.S.

Moreover, the DPRK has never attempted nor made a "cyber-attack" on south Korea. The rumor about "cyber-attack" by the DPRK was a concoction made by the south Korean puppet regime and its plot.

After all, the grounds cited by the FBI in its announcement were all based on obscure sci-tech data and false story and, accordingly, the announcement itself is another fabrication. This is the DPRK's stand on the U.S. gangster-like behavior against it.

What is grave is that U.S. President Obama is recklessly making the rumor about "DPRK's cyber-attack on Sony Pictures" a fait accompli while crying out for symmetric counteraction, strict calculation and additionally retaliatory sanctions.

This is like beating air after being hit hard. A saying goes every sin brings its punishment with it. It is best for the guilty to repent of its evil doings and draw a lesson when forced to pay dearly for them.

The DPRK has clear evidence that the U.S. administration was deeply involved in the making of such dishonest reactionary movie.

It is said that the movie was conceived and produced according to the "guidelines" of the U.S. authorities who contended that such movies hurting the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership and inciting terrorism against it would be used in an effective way as "propaganda against north Korea".

The U.S. Department of State's special human rights envoy went the lengths of urging the movie makers to keep all scenes insulting the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership in the movie, saying it is needed to "vex the north Korean government".

The facts glaringly show that the U.S. is the chief culprit of terrorism as it has loudly called for combating terrorism everywhere in the world but schemed behind the scene to produce and distribute movies inciting it in various countries of the world.

It is not exaggeration to say in the light of the prevailing situation that the U.S. administration and President Obama looking after the overall state affairs of the U.S. have been behind the case.

Can he really cover up the crimes he has committed by trying so hard to falsify the truth and turn white to black.

So we watched with unusual attention what had been done by the "guardians of peace" to avert terrorism and defend justice.

Yet, we do not know who or where they are but we can surely say that they are supporters and sympathizers with the DPRK.

The army and people of the DPRK who aspire after justice and truth and value conscience have hundreds of millions of supporters and sympathizers, known or unknown, who have turned out in the sacred war against terrorism and the U.S. imperialists, the chieftain of aggression, to accomplish the just cause.

Obama personally declared in public the "symmetric counteraction", a disgraceful behavior.

There is no need to guess what kind of thing the "symmetric counteraction" is like but the army and people of the DPRK will never be browbeaten by such a thing.

The DPRK has already launched the toughest counteraction. Nothing is more serious miscalculation than guessing that just a single movie production company is the target of this counteraction. Our target is all the citadels of the U.S. imperialists who earned the bitterest grudge of all Koreans.

The army and people of the DPRK are fully ready to stand in confrontation with the U.S. in all war spaces including cyber warfare space to blow up those citadels.

Our toughest counteraction will be boldly taken against the White House, the Pentagon and the whole U.S. mainland, the cesspool of terrorism, by far surpassing the "symmetric counteraction" declared by Obama.

This is the invariable toughest stand of the army and people of the DPRK.

Fighters for justice including "guardians of peace" who turned out in the sacred drive for cooperation in the fight against the U.S. to defend human justice and conscience and to dismember the U.S. imperialists, the root cause of all sorts of evils and kingpin of injustice, are sharpening bayonets not only in the U.S. mainland but in all other parts of the world.

The just struggle to be waged by them across the world will bring achievements thousands of times greater than the hacking attack on the Sony Pictures Entertainment.

It is the truth and inevitability of the historical development that justice prevails over injustice.

Whoever challenges justice by toeing the line of the biggest criminal U.S. will never be able to escape merciless punishment as it is the target of the sacred drive for cooperation in the fight against the U.S.

The U.S. should reflect on its evil doings that put itself in such a trouble, apologize to the Koreans and other people of the world and should not dare pull up others.

 It would not surprise me if it is standard procedure for when a hijacked plane turns towards a city. 




 I always wonder why they don't poison them just before release.  Some  long term illness like cancer that might not be noticed for years.   they could induce it by exposing prisoners to carcinogens .  That way they neutralise threats and can get rid of the political blemish. 

































































































































 i only wanted him to change the way lobbiest and money influence policy.  All the things in the image just seem like consequences of a tainted system of democracy. 




 What  if ISIL stopped executing hostages and instead, they just filmed sequences of endless torture using the same techniques of the CIA.   I am trying to imagine how the America media would dress it up .  

I think it is the lack of outrage on torture that is the problem.  I won't complain about people reacting to the"The interview" release unless it becomes clear that the sony reaction has been all about boosting dvd sales.
 




  People love to vote on quick fix images over effort posts.  Just another day on reddit 









 In the category of stunning, heartening, woefully underreported good news: In 2000, an estimated 9.9million children around the world died before age 5. In 2013, the figure was 6.3million. That is 3.6 million fewer deaths, even as the worlds population increased by about 1 billion.


There are a variety of reasons for increased child survival, including improved prevention of malaria and HIV. But according to a recent report in the Lancet, about half of these gains came from reductions in pneumonia, diarrhea and measles  diseases addressed by vaccination. 


What is exceptional about this particular public good is how much of it has been generated by a single source.  - Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance  supports vaccination for nearly 60 percent of the worlds children. It is a global conspiracy of health.

Gavi provides heavy but eventually diminishing subsidies for immunizations in poor countries. It also acts as a sort of purchasing co-op, helping nations get better prices on vaccines. And it amounts to a guaranteed market for vaccines that would not otherwise be profitable to research and produce.

Apply what you say to the media in general, then you got a point . 




 fair enough they want to overthrow Assad and you are right that it is a wider point.  I agree it is supporting one side more than another but I don't think it is a level of interference that should be polticised.  I expect that there are real and unsavory ways that they do support effort against Assad.  

 These militants in Syria are responsible for targeting civilians, were they doing that to Israel's people the medical care would precede imprisonment.

Indeed they would. I hope they would arrest those suspected of war crimes.  However, for them it is  syrian rebels fighting in a syrian civil war.  They probably don't ask too many questions.  




 I don't see it as ridiculous to characterise humanitarian assistance as a humanitarian act .  Do you want them not to treat fighters or not to be there at all?

 Not sure of the equivalence of Hamas.  Maybe you can explain that?  

  




 in a way I admire it.  I had little appreciation of the power of economic sanctions but looking at this and looking back to what happened in soviet times help me see the power.  Of course a country struggling economically can react in a few undesirable ways.

 I don't think people have a realistic understanding of what torture is.  If we substituted the word  "torture" for "rape" people might react a bit different and feel horrified.   It is just a word but it triggers people to the reality of what it is rather than viewing it as an enhanced interrogation technique.

I expect Shoving hummus up rectums is considered sexual assault/rape in some contexts and so this is how it should be described.
 




 A programmer would give you advice about programming.  I can explain how to do it in HTML but it sounds like you are looking for a piece of software or an online wizard.

However, I think Sony are trying to make the most of it now and will make big money out of the movie.  It is easy to slip into thinking that they planned it from the start.   However, I believe that there is real damage being done in the leaks. 

 









 Is there a broader point here that I am missing?  This is just combat footage/ hospital footage.  Treating the injured whether friends or enemies is a pretty basic and human thing.  I hope that people are not going to try and politicise it.  There are so many other things to notice about this region. 




 Vladimir Putin has blamed the west for the current crisis, and hes not alone. While locals have likened it to an economic war, some western commentators agree.
Earlier this year, back when oil was still at around $88 a barrel, New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman pointed the finger squarely at the US for the collapse.
Widely accepted in Russia, is that the US and Saudi Arabia are colluding to keep production artificially high in a bid to drive the price down.
The net result has been to make life difficult for Russia and Iran, at a time when Saudi Arabia and America are confronting both of them in a proxy war in Syria, he wrote. This is business, but it also has the feel of war by other means: oil.

**Just as they did to the last leaders of the Soviet Union, the Americans and Saudis are trying to pump them to  death**

 So the government is justified to use of anti-terrorism laws in local law enforcement ?   I've heard the funding terrorism argument enough when fighting small crime.    














 The constant distrust in the system is what has historically given rise to fascism

Check what happened in the 1930's with distrust of public officials etc.

So the current sentiment of how terrible the government is and how impossible everything seems to be a repeat of what empowered facists. 

  I will write more on it some time.  I know people here think their constant outrage at the system is a good thing.  Maybe it is healthy.  However, I see it as a danger.  It just depends on what predators are lurking.

Background : 


An off-shoot of the PID (Paul is Dead) phenomenon / legend.  I find the whole PID thing interesting, simply with regard to how many weird splinter theories have popped up:

* Paul died, and was replaced

* Paul did NOT die, but was replaced (often called "PWR" instead of "PID")

* Paul did not die, and was not replaced, but the "clues" point to a **SPIRITUAL** death and rebirth, as seen in Christianity, the ancient mystery schools, the occult, etc.  (The symbolic death and rebirth theory is a favorite of mine, and IMO one of the more plausible theories)

* ALL of The Beatles were replaced (Personally, I find this one extra silly. Replacing one guy would be hard enough. Replacing four of the most known guys on the planet? Good luck with that. Some people also insist that *many* celebrities were  replaced. Bob Dylan, Davy Jones, etc...)

* The Beatles were part of a conspiracy by The Tavistock Institute (and/or other groups) to change social attitudes, and/or destroy Christianity (be a  les(s), and/or brainwash youth.


I believe thebeatlesneverexisted.com falls somewhere between the last two categories. The general theory being that for some reason, The Powers That Be wanted to force social change in the 1960s, which they accomplished using "tools" like The Beatles. This is usually considered in a sinister light. I find some versions of this theory to be more plausible than others. 

A researcher named Dave McGowan theorizes that the **entire** hippy movement / psychedelic rock scene in the 1960's was started by the government, as a social engineering project. Some aspects of this story are strange, and seem unbelievable, but he's collected a bit of information, some of which does seem... odd...

For example, some of the big psychedelic rock pioneers and legends come from military / intelligence families. For example, Jim Morrison's dad was one of these. Famously, when asked about his parents by reporters, Morrison claimed his parents were dead. (If memory serves, this can even be seen in Oliver Stone's biopic)  In reality, of course, this was not true. Now, this could be because he (or "they" if you want to be all spooky and conspiracy theory about it) wanted to distance himself from his military parents. And that *could* be to throw people off the trail of the conspiracy. But it could just as easily be due to the fact that rebel rocker Jim didn't want it known that he was a military brat. 

One of the things that makes this story somewhat plausible to me, however... there is some minor evidence that the government / intelligence community may have been "behind" some of the proliferation of psychedelic use, and psychedelic culture. The CIA experimented with LSD for many years before it hit the streets. They even tested it on unwitting civilians, in one or two now-declassified programs. And some of the early major LSD "cooks" and gurus have ties to government and intelligence. Owsley. Leary. If you know much abut the history of Tim Leary, you may know he wrote a personality test the government supposedly uses to this day. And you may also know that the man got into quite a bit of hot water, and almost seemed to miraculously "weasel" out of it, unscathed. The Life article that popularized Magic Mushrooms? By R Gordon Wasson. A banker who supposedly had intelligence ties. The mushroom article that so fascinated the public, published in Life magazine, owned by Henry Luce. Another man with intelligence ties. 

It's a bit complex and convoluted, but really fascinating stuff, if you're willing to read with an open mind. 


You can read quite a bit more about Dave McGowan's theories about the ties between Hippies, Psychedelics, and the Intelligence community, in his work "Inside the LC" (Laurel Canyon, in California) on his website:

http://www.davesweb.cnchost.com/


You can read more about the CIA's experiments with LSD (and much more) in the book "Acid Dreams: The Complete Social History of LSD: the CIA, the Sixties, and Beyond"  By Martin A Lee, and Bruce Shlain. Really excellent book. I can't recommend it enough.

And you can read (or listen) to more about intelligence ties to psychedelic culture (and lots of other related, and unrelated topics) over at Jan Irvin's website, "Gnostic Media."

[Jan Irvin Interview:  Creation of the Drug Culture](http://www.gnosticmedia.com/the-corbett-report-interview-672-jan-irvin-on-the-cia-mk-ultra-and-the-creation-of-the-drug-culture/)


Tying all this back to The Beatles?  Well, let's just pretend for a moment that the government, or some other group *did* want people to take psychedelic drugs for some reason...  What better way to make it look more attractive, than to get Paul McCartney ("the cute one") on TV talking, quite unapologetically, about how *he* had taken it?


Or maybe that's not what happened at all. It's fun/interesting to think about, though.

Hopefully someone finds this interesting.

 Gamers... haven't lost a single fight in the history of the internet. Every single time they have ever fought in an issue dealing with censorship, insane ass people, and even against very idiotic journalists. They have won time and time again in the past in almost a unstoppable manner.
We survived the 80/90's of parental fears and censorship by creating our own version of the ratings scale which is far more accurate and far better than even the movie industry. Instead of Teen rated games dragging down M rated games, each and every rating is independent and has remained so even in the wake of insanity that is Jack Thompson and California's insane bills.
Jack Thompson is dis-barred and I am pretty sure he is officially looning it out somewhere in Florida. I could be wrong but I think that is the last place he was at. (Actually. This would actually be a pretty fascinating interview for some post career thing.)
Anyone involved with the California bill has pretty much been a laughing stock since then.
Then there are authors who have went on Fox news to talk about the evil's of video games and video gamers responded by trashing their books. In a way that is very petty but it does have the effect of getting the message clear... one which the anti-gamer gate really needs to listen to.
Gamers are done being harassed.
I have said this before in previous topics but I will restate it once more. Gamers are done being bullied. They want to peacefully be able to play video games, occasional read about video games and be able to feel like they aren't being judged for the games they play anymore. This is really simply it.
And do you know something, Gamergate has lasted over TWO FUCKING MONTHS NOW!
Two months of it under constant attack for simply asking questions. In all honesty, this kind of retention rate for something on the internet if fucking astounding in and of itself. Most people thought this would be done in a week, nope. Not even ME3's ending pissed people off this damn much.
And judging by how tweets are going. This movement is only getting bigger and being talked about more and after the bully storm that is the mainsteam press is done when it usually does in terms of insulting gamers constantly. The dust will list and Gamergate is still going to be here.
Wanna know why I know Gamergate is literally not going to be negatively effected by this?
Because Gamergate is full of gamers.
Gamers... are the most terrifying force on the entirety of the internet in existence. I say this as a gamer but in terms of forces you sincerely do not want to fuck with. It's gamers.
Gamers by all definitions do not have a 'give up' thought in their brains. They believe otherwise. No matter how impossible of a challenge it is. They will seek to overcome it no matter the obstacle. No matter how much abuse they take and no matter how long it takes. Gamers are unstoppable due to the fact that they are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve victory, they will do things thought impossible even by the games own rules or even exploit the rules to their own gain. They will wait and grind their power up until they can fully unleashed almost godlike characters within their games.
Even then, they are some of the kindest people in history, the fact is. Most people never actually willingly ever do evil playthroughs in their video games. Talk to developers about it, it's the truth, hell, most people never even touched renegade options in ME series. Then there is the fact that they even have helped supported countless charities. Hell, even now people on twitch are playing games so some kids with cancer can hopefully become cured one day! Then there are moments where there are some poor people who really haven't played a video game in their life and people actually donate game systems and video games to them so they can play.
The truth is that video gamers are willing to accept anyone into the hobby no matter the background. This has had some bad effects due to... well... assholes playing video games. But even then the truly despicable people are usually ostracized anyways.
Gamers are merciless, they are patient, They are kind, they are giving, they are absolutely terrifying.
Then there is the biggest fact of all that I think you all have noticed throughout this topic. Gamers do not actually care what gender you are. At all. The only reason you think they do is because people are pushing that gamers 'believe' in this or that without any real explaination or even proof. The truth is, yes, there are some assholes on xbox live and such, but are gamers as a whole assholes. Hell no. The fact is that we are not severely self policing ourselves just to prove without a shadow of a doubt that we don't take kindly to this shit should say that, even though there are assholes, we ourselves will help take care of them.
But most of this is ignored. Either due to the fact that mainstream media has always fucking despised us or the fact that game journalists have finally shown their true colors and decided that their audience is made up of assholes.
Gamers are not standing for it and this is the result. Gamergate, a movement which has been building for several years now. This is only going to become more and more well known until they cannot actually ignore gamergates side anymore. Then the house of cards will tumble and those that once thought of bullying us gamers will know that gamers wrath is fucking terrifying.
Game journalists. We don't need you anymore and Gamergate has sufficient proof of that, we can communicate on our own, recommend games on our own. We gamers don't need your bias anymore. Good luck when the final blow is struck because I can personally assure every journalist out there about this one fact.
Gamers are not just merciless, but vengeful, any job you will try and get in the future will immediately be intercepted and warned about your past behavior in public. This is what will happen and no place of integrity will ever touch you. Hell, even more fast food joints wouldn't even touch you if you have the kind of mouth people like Bob Chipman have about being pro censorship and even subjugating gamers who disagree with him to even the dude who helps run Gawker who wants to bully gamers.
You will never have jobs after this industry. Gamers remember and never forget and if you want proof. Look at Phil Fish for a moment and tell yourselves this. Will that man ever have a job after the shit he pulled? No, no he won't.
This is not a threat, but what will happen in the future just as I had known that Gamergate would have eventually happened one way or the other.
Honestly. If you are anti-GG you need to know these things. Gamers just want peace and ethics. But since it is obvious that it isn't going to happen. Expect this entire debate to continue onwards for years and it is going to become more and more serious.
Big edit. I should also mention that the word, 'impossible' is literally non-existent within gamers minds. This word and it's meaning holds no sway for gamers. These are people who, under 3 differing guilds within Everquest brought together 300 people to fight an ultimate dragon and actually managed to out heal it and out damage something people honestly thought was impossible to the point where developers shut down the fight and pissed everyone off for nearly winning something thought impossible.
Then there are people who actively accomplish impossible feats against even the largest forces possible in video games. Hell, just look at Dark Souls. That entire game series is built upon accomplishing fighting fallen Gods and actually fighting them with respect and end up becoming a bigger badass than all of them. Hell, just look at a game like the entirety of the Shin Megami Tensei series. A series literally built upon even the most common enemies being strong enough to absolutely murder your sorry ass and instead you have to prove you are a badass by kicking the hell out of everything ass.
Gamers don't understand what the word impossible even is. To them, it is a goal line to cross.

 




 Is the depiction of the police playing to a stereotype of the jews?  

I can't find the source of this.  Looks like an album cover judging by the format

Edit: a few downvotes without comments.  I noticed what I think is a synagogue in the background and so I can see the artist's intent .  The tapestry on the building looks significant too.

 I agree that it would be a great stunt but as a marketing stunt it would be limited to a vandalised facebook page or something.

It appears that real damage is being done beyond what a film can generate.  I am also sure that no-bullshit cyberdefence people will be looking into this especially if it appears as a government mandated attack.  I am also cynical that NK would deploy their capabilities on something like this as it just allows defenders to plug holes for future attacks.  

I am sure the film will do better than expected now.  this much it true.

 Sweden as a country that likes to pretend it champions net freedom, but itself does the exact opposite: did you know that Sweden has given the copyright industry powers of net surveillance that even the Police dont have?

Sweden likes to portray itself as a country that champions the importance of the net and its freedom, and is never late to criticize other countries, but is one of the worst offenders in the West when it comes to respecting this fantastic tool that upsets the old guard and the status quo.
Today, we look at the curious IPRED law in Sweden. It was introduced in silence and shadow in the summer of 2007 by the Justice Departments Stefan Johansson, who has also been Swedens and the EUs negotiator at the ACTA table, and who has frequently been seen at Swedens Association For Copyright.
The really insidious thing about the IPRED law is its name: it copies the name from a European directive (IPRED), but legislates things that the European directive explicitly doesnt contain or force Sweden to do. Therefore, politicians of all colors have defended themselves saying that Sweden must implement European Union directives, whereas in reality, they are pursuing their own agenda and trying to wash their hands of responsibility.

The law concerns the copyright industrys right to violate privacy  specifically, demanding subscriber identities of IP addresses, on allegations of violation of the copyright monopoly (typically, file sharing), and sue them in court where presumption of innocence does not apply. In Sweden, the Police may only break the privacy of identities behind IP addresses when the crime being investigated is severe enough to result in a jail sentence. But most file sharing cases have stayed at fines, and therefore, the Police does not have this power.

So Sweden has granted private corporate interests  the copyright industry  more extensive powers than the Police, in terms of cracking down on the Net and making dissent and civil disobedience dangerous.

 Great comment.  have some gold!

 Great work so far, I get the feeling that these posts will become a template for people battling against Comcast.

It's also in these times I find it fantastic to live in Ireland where there are at least 5 different competing companies begging for a subscription. Which really shows how good regulations can increase competition and remove monopolies.

 God bless the SAS. They're one of the biggest reasons not to screw with Britain.
 




 originally it was "the people" but they wanted "my people" and so it took some chopping and trickery but you saw through it 




 This is awesome.  I will mix it into a little educational montage.

Meanwhile, enjoy the gold! 




 Britain should recruit british citizens to become fighters.  There would be plenty of volunteers especially if it was a government endorsed program to support the moderate syrian opposition and not terrorists.  Somehow they won't allow that but will fuel those already there including foreign fighters. 




 They aren't destroying online freedom.  They are monitoring it and eroding privacy.  The law of the country applies online and offline.  So question the fundamental laws.  "Freedom" should not only exist online and I think it is annoying that people try and reserve online as a place to be free.  People should be free everywhere especially scotland. 




 maybe the fact that big industry types are not getting involved tells you something.  I dont think they really care to enhance netflix's business model 
 




 I'd say that snooping on worldleaders and decision makes is exactly what intelligence organisations are meant to do.  The contentious issue is mass untargeted surveilance
