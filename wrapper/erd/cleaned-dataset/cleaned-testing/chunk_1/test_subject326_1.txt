 I thought that possibly too, but if OP's baby was screaming because of the entity, then I don't think I'd rule it a nice one. 




 It's always interesting to meet a fellow empath. I've been sensitive to pretty much all energies. I know it can get overwhelming too, so let me be the first to say I believe you! I've dealt with several supernatural entities over the years, and I really do think they mess with us just because we can notice them easier than other people. It's scary to know something's in your house that can move things and touch you, especially when you may be the only one who notices. I hope the entities you've encountered haven't been too oppressive over the years, they can really drain you.
