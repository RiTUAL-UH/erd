 If we're sharing stories, back when I was an RA I got a call at 3am from my boss saying EMS was on their way and I needed to meet two students outside with them.

Long story short, the boyfriend was at the girlfriends dorm room and while they were getting it on the girlfriend passed out and the boyfriend panicked and called 911.

While we were standing outside with EMS the boyfriend asked the EMS worker if she passed out because he was putting it in her butt...
