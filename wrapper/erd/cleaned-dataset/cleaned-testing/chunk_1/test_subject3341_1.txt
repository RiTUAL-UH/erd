 Anyone see the guy grab his dick at the end?  




 Works for me on Google Chrome.  




 Those original game cube controllers must have cost you a fortune on Amazon... oh wait, yes it did. 




 He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector... a Cat Knight.  









 Should be The Last Of Us.  




 Does anyone notice her leg on the left is facing the wrong way? If you pulled your leg all the way back like that her knee would be touching the top of her head...

EDIT: Never mind I see it now....
 




 Well that escalated quickly. 




 I think this has more to do with your tastes maturing rather than just the fact of more exposure. If I hate something I hate it no matter how much I'm exposed to it; only if my tastes and attitudes change will my opinions change.  




 No. Just no.  




 Skyrim Total Enhancement Project (STEP). Search it up and follow the directions for a much more beautiful game.  




 Sounds like you need new friends.  




 CATERPIE!!! 




 Mission Impossible 4?? 




 What kind of girlfriend uses sex as a bargaining tool? 




 and the first? 




 The Playstation 2 could: play all Playstation 2 games ever made.

YA DON'T SAY 




 Guy was caught jerking off in the library. Apparently he had came into a few books before.  




 "Black" 




 Pikachu main, here. I use the c-stick for quick down smashes (roll + down smash is king). Whenever I want to charge a smash I use direction + A.

I'd say it's more personal preference than anything, I know some great players who don't use the c-stick at all. I have found, though, that all the insane players I know ALL use the c-stick. So it would seem that it is your friends that are the noobs and you that are the pro. 

C-stick is also invaluable for directional air attacks. Pikachu's are amazing, so I use the c-stick A LOT for that.  




 Your sister is a certified qt3.14 




 Iguana meet this girl. 




 Why girls need to lie about this stuff is beyond me.  




 WHERE'S THE C-STICK? I NEED MY C-STICK 




 You come across a child drowning in a river.
Would you rather save the child's life and have no one know what you did, or fail to save to save his/her life (even if you could) and be forever known as the hero who tried? 




 In Asian countries they have a plastic bin right next to the trash meant for liquids. Why they don't have that here is beyond me.  









 More like scumbag EA. 




 This is such an obvious shop it's not even funny. 




 Why is this in cringepics? 




 I see what you're doing... 




 Hashtags. 




 Your picture actually made me say "oh my god" out loud. First post in a LONG time to make me do that. Congrats. 




 Not on campus, but pretty sure I might have seen it off campus near Shadyside or up Craig Street. Lots of buildings that look similar close to CMU.  




 You are NOT overqualified for anything. Get your ass out there and work! 




 The Social Network. Epic, touching, Harvard and Trent Reznor. 




 haha sorry, I actually am almost out. I know quite a few people who have more than a hundred dollars left though :) 




 This design was submitted.

Who could possibly say that the design that was chosen is better than this one? The quality of the submissions was not the problem here. 




 Not very good, the teacher is pretty bad and doesn't teach econ very well. Fortunately, I took AP Micro in high school, so I was able to do well. 
It's not a particularly hard class, so if you're able to get through her B.S. teaching you'll be able to get an A.  




 I can't believe CMU ended up with this design. With our amazing design and arts school, I never expected this would happen. 
The petition that was created the first day of voting did nothing, and the creator of the petition was told to take it down because it might offend the creators of the design. I highly doubt anything we do at this point would be able to change anything.  




 it's bytes, like I said CMU's internet is INSANE. 
and Donner looks super ugly from the outside but it's pretty nice inside.  




 I live in Donner, which is really nice, coed by wing (west and east), largest rooms for a double, walls are pretty thick here. Apparently Stever is considered one of the worst freshman dorms so if you liked it you should be fine anywhere. Morewood has the smallest rooms though, almost tiny compared to mine. 

The internet here is AMAZING, I get ~13 mbps download speed on WIFI which in my opinion is incredible. Yes, sometimes it cuts out randomly for like half a minute but it's infrequent enough that it's not a nuisance. Ethernet is the most stable, never ever had it cut out but I get slower download speeds ~10 mbps. You have a 50 Gb download limit for 5 days but you will never EVER go over it, I download large files constantly and have no problem (I once redownloaded my entire steam library and was fine). There are gaming clubs, not sure if for CS:GO but I'm sure you could form one easily.  




 Red 9. You won't be eating very much here, even though there's no buffets except Shatz they give you a lot of food. I'm a dude that normally eats a lot and these blocks fill me up to the point where I only need to eat two meals a day and a few snacks I can buy at entropy. Red 9 gives you $720 DineX which is more than you should ever need (most people don't use it all, and I actually have to make an effort to spend all of it by the semester).  




 go live in any asian country 




 he tried to hit backspace to delete the "i" but he hit "=" instead 




 I heard they gave out 2,000 tickets but they only have space for 1,500... I doubt even people with tickets will be able to get in.
