 Either works well. An accounting and finance degree is more immediately practical for that specific job. An econ degree, especially from a good school is more respected even beyond banking since its a harder degree. Either way for banking, you need to follow the templatized recruitment process and network hard. 




 Yes. Its possible. You need to network hard and be in NY a lot. The other responses are spot on that the best place to start is your alumni network. Join your college finance club and do things like training the street to get up to speed on valuation / modeling, etc.


 









 fine :) I take it back. It does get expensive and its a continuum of costs as you look to get further certifications and rack up flight hours.

My new answer is get Microsoft VBA certified. Nothing says "popular with the ladies" like Microsoft VBA certified 




 I agree. it can range. It was a long time ago and prices have gone up since then. The point being that its in that range, is relatively non-cumbersome to get a VFR and is a very fun hobby that people like to learn more about. Also I think its likely cheaper  to get in SoCal than Canada (but maybe not $5k any more) 




 You are absolutely right. Salary depends on a lot of things. 

If you are asked a salary requirement in a form at the start of an interview process - just leave it blank. There is almost no upside to giving them a number until you are close to getting the job.

When you are close to getting the job, they will typically call and ask you for a range or number. There are a range of negotiating techniques but the most effective one (proven by studies) has been found to be a range, where the salary you are willing to accept is the low end of that range, and your top end of that range is  10-20%  over that. Typically your current salary should be below that range because presumably your switching costs involve you not wanting to move for the same pay.

Quote the salary as all-in. i.e., basic salary + bonus. Benefits are important but somewhat secondary. If their benefits package is weak, you should tactically let them know that during the negotiation process if thats important to you.

 Yeah I just meant VFR. I think all great hobbies cost time and money to really pursue but the question was just for a skill that was cool, cheap and quick. A VFR fits those requirements.  









 If you live in places like Southern California, its not that hard or expensive to become a private pilot. It costs ~$5,000 and takes 40 hours of lessons to get the basic pilot certification. 

I know thats relatively expensive compared to the other things people mention below, but its not much for a really cool hobby. People always want to chat with you if you are a private pilot.

EDIT: This post previously said 40 years / I meant 40 hours. Typo. But candidly, y'all are an impatient bunch.  




 I run a career website http://tapwage.com

We have curated collections of jobs and career articles completely free. I'll readily admit that there are many free job sites out there and media sites out there. But we are trying really hard to provide a quality job finding and career advice experience. 

For our early users, If you ask us a career question or ask for a specific type of job you are interested in, we'll help you find those jobs or answers.  




 Your resume looks fine but its really useful to make it a little more action oriented so it shows that you care about the results of what you achieve. 

Simple things: e.g., are there certain subjects where you consistently scored As? Can you elaborate on the achievements at your volunteer efforts. How many students did you tutor?

Fix the formatting on your resume. Right now the line spaces are inconsistent and that looks sloppy.

I have a lot more tips that may be relevant here: http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/02/27/7-rules-for-writing-a-killer-resume



 




 On its own "ethical investing" doesn't outperform other forms of investing, and sometimes underperforms - for good reasons. Its hard enough finding alpha (outsized returns) in a  relatively efficient market place, its really hard to do that with constraints. Moreover, the best portfolio managers are not incentivized to do ethical investing.

I like how the industry has evolved beyond that to "impact investing". This is more than ethical investing. This is looking at specific areas where you know resource allocation has been awry (for political, social and / or cultural reasons) and using investing to correct that imbalance. 

A great example is funds that invest in women and / or minority founders. Its well known and well documented that women and minorities struggle to raise money from traditional VCs. But mathematically, there is no reason for this segment of founders to under-perform for any reason. So impact investing in this segment has an arbitrage benefit where you can fund underrepresented founders and avail of overlooked opportunities. As the systemic biases normalize though, the alpha opportunities will reduce. But others might come up. These types of investing have shown the ability to perform and outperform the market. That said, it still depends a lot on the quality of investment manager talent that these funds are able to get.

 Impact investing is a really interesting way to look at the world. I don't think CSR fully reflects that wide range of things impact investing is. Impact investing is also evolving so its not just "sustainable investing" or "non profit" investing but like any investing its about finding alpha (outsized returns). There happen to be meaningful outsized returns in areas like renewable energy, sustainable emerging market business models, and investing with women and minority founders who have traditionally found it harder to raise money within the existing VC ecosystem.

 very well put! 




 Supply chain jobs? No. These are resource allocation / analytics jobs that are fairly high end. These jobs can easily pay upwards of $100k / year at many big firms. The tools and data and analytics continue to get more advanced - there is a real focus on big data and using insight driven forecasting tools. Some of the more manual elements of this job will get automated like low-end procurement type roles but that can be said if almost any job (even programming jobs get automated as tools get more advanced). What is likely to happen to these jobs is that they continue to get more sophisticated, require more training and become higher paying.

The other important thing to remember is that supply chain is really the integration and coordination of many different functions that used to be separate like sourcing, manufacturing, logistics, distribution. Massive companies like Coca Cola, Nike, etc. have realized that by centrally managing, forecasting, planning and negotiating, they can save massive amounts of money, and ensure that new products can be distributed instantly where there is demand. The supply chain is actually the central nervous systems of these companies connecting the various silos. Many companies are only just beginning this integration and coordination, which is why supply chain jobs are in such demand. As this supply chain revolution continues - these jobs will continue to remain in demand for a while
 




 no. I just remembered to remind you since sometimes people search for continents and our search isn't fully built yet (focus is on curated collections of jobs). We'll have real time smart searching capabilities soon. We get our jobs from thousands of companies directly 




 Thats really interesting. Btw: my site is in its early stages. Best way is to search for Singapore or Hong Kong (or Kuala Lumpur) on it as opposed to searching for "Asia". We will enable a smarter search soon. 

Let me know if you have questions on moving to Singapore. Its a great place to work and live.  




 Being a product manager is a really interesting job at many companies, especially technology companies because you get to experience the life cycle of a product across various division - finance, strategy, technology, supply chain, marketing, etc.

So these roles can be great stepping stone to broader management careers. I think of product management at a tech company to supply chain type jobs at big consumer companies. These are breeding grounds for future leadership.

The best way to understand what these roles are and what these roles require int terms of experience and skill set is by looking at a range of these job postings and getting a sense from how they are framed. Typically these are for former techies who have some management experience or potentially an MBA and show strategic thinking capabilities and good interpersonal capabilities. These roles liaise with nearly every functional group in the company so great interpersonal skills is key.

Here is a collection of some product management roles:

I run a career site - tapwage.com
If any of you have questions on these roles and how to get them, feel free to contact me 




 yes, we do. We are adding a lot more jobs in that area soon, but right now, we do have thousands of jobs in Asia across industries / fields. I love Asia. I used to be an expat in Singapore ages ago. Nice choice of continent to go to.  




 We have jobs and career advice for all industries globally. Either way - I hope you find a job you love. Good luck! 




 This is actually a wide range of jobs including supply chain, procurement and sourcing. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple was a long -time executive in Supply Chain at Compaq and then Apple before rising to the roles that led to becoming CEO of Apple.

So what is Supply Chain? It is the planning and management of the supply of a companies products to the market place. Right from sourcing the raw materials, getting them manufactured, handling shipping and logistics to getting them to the right distributors and retailers. 

As companies become more global, products become more advanced and complicated to make (an iPhone involves thousands of components sourced from all over the world), this job becomes really important.

You don't need to study supply chain to do it. Study finance or business, or accounting, or engineering. Focus on numbers and quantitative analysis, join a large organization as a supply chain analyst or procurement analyst and learn on the job. These jobs can pay very well and can give you a unique chance to learn the company and industry end to end and one day rise to a C-level position.

I run a career site - Tapwage.com and have a ton of great supply chain jobs at the biggest brands around the world here:

If you have questions about this, contact me here or on Tapwage and will be happy to give you more guidance 




 I would avoid this. I run a career site (tapwage.com) and we have seen and heard of a lot of instances of this going badly. You potentially get sued or have your reputation tarnished over something that at best makes you slightly more efficient. Not to mention, the recent situation where the Goldman programmer went to jail as a result. 

In general, what you do at work is the employers property, even if it doesn't contain non-public information, so on the whole, I would avoid taking templates or any similar work products with you. Have faith in yourself that you will build better templates at your new work environment 




 Posting to multiple sub-reddits is not an automatic sign of spam. Unclear of the guideline here.  




 I agree with this but sometimes companies frown upon people sending emails home. On my work email and home email, I keep a folder called "Contact Information" and move those emails to that folder as soon as I get them. Then if / when I leave the job, I print those emails out and take with me. 

 














 There are actually quite a lot of interesting data science and quantitative roles that you can search for across industries but sometimes its not easy to find them since they are called a lot of different things. We started a site - tapwage.com to curate job collections to address this sort of thing. A few such channels you can look at are:

http://tapwage.com/channel/artificial-intelligence-meets-financial-intelligence (this has quant jobs in banks for engineers)
http://tapwage.com/channel/data-driven-internships

There is also an article that discusses this in greater detail: http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/08/big-data-means-big-employment

PM / or message us on the site if you have questions and happy to answer further questions or create a custom collection for you. 




 I disagree with the below comments that say that there are only data science jobs in NY or the bay area There are actually data science jobs all over, especially since corporate employers are really focused on this capability.

Check out Data science job collections on tapwage.com to get a curated list of such jobs: http://tapwage.com/?tag=%5B145%5D

Or search the database. Hundreds of jobs all over:

Note - not all data science jobs are explicitly called data science jobs. Depending on your qualifications, there may be many different places to look for such jobs.  




 Hilarious story of the guy who asked Quora what job he should choose

http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/07/how-to-lose-a-job-offer-in-10-days 




 Quitting a job is hard. If you have been with a company a long time, it's often like leaving family. I am convinced that a lot of people are so terrified about the thought of resigning that they just put off finding a new job, even if they aren't satisfied with their current one. This post is to help you through the logistics of resigning. Assuming you have made the decision to accept another offer, or pursue something else, follow these steps to make sure you transition from your current role in a graceful and organized way. 

Go to this link to see the checklist and read the article:
http://tapwage.com/cheatsheets/2015/05/07/7-things-to-do-before-you-resign


 




 There are quite a lot of roles you can look at:
1. Marketing or business roles at biotech companies and pharma cos like J J often look for biotech undergraduates

2. Go to a startup. There are many great startup life sciences firms looking for someone with scientific experience but for non-scientific roles and at a startup, you can grow with the organization into other positions.
Check out this collection of jobs here: 
http://tapwage.com/channel/startup-biologist

You could even go to a bank or investment firm and do biotech research, many of which require biotech / scientific experience and undergraduate degrees:
http://tapwage.com/searchresult?keyword=biotech location=
 




 That is a conundrum. You should never tell an employer that you are looking to leave until you actually will leave.

I would actually be honest with your boss. Tell him or her that the reason you had confessed to wanting to leave is because you felt alienated and not socially integrated, but that you enjoy the work and his / her mentorship. Tell them that you have had a chance to think about it and if they are open to it, you would like to stay and build a career. And ask for their advice on how you could do better to socially integrate at work. 

If that doesn't go well, check out http://tapwage.com and see if you can find a better job. Designers are in huge demand and there are great jobs out there. Good luck! 




 AI and Machine learning developers are in huge demand. This is an interesting collection of jobs at banks and hedge funds looking for developers in investment roles:
http://tapwage.com/channel/artificial-intelligence-meets-financial-intelligence 




 Thats not an uncommon route path at all. Most common route to Private equity is via an investment bank. Join as an analyst and after the 2-year program, its very easy to recruit into PE. You can try and do that right after undergrad but its harder.

For Portfolio Management, a CFA helps a lot. Again, these roles are easier after 2 years in the investment banking or sales and trading analyst program. IBs tend to have structured recruiting and big classes and then the PE and hedge funds tend to recruit from there.
