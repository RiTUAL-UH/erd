 You seriously dont see the eyes? They have pupils and everything. The movie I was watching was the expendables 3. At the 59 min mark approx. It started skipping then froze at this spot. At first i figured it was just a flaw in the disc but thats when i noticed that fucker in the corner. I tried replaying this part but nothing comes close to looking like that image.  









 The bottom of course. All of the power is generated from the bottom. A power bottom. 




 The movie froze up at about the 59 min mark. With the drone ascemding into the air.
