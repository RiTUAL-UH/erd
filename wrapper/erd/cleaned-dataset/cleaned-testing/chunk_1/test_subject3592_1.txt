 I get 6.98 MBPS here in Talbot :( 




 The union one has this system where if you work for an hour for them, they'll give you $10 worth of posters. And the work is simple -- hand out fliers or put posters back into their covers etc.  




 Yeah that's what I'm saying. Sometimes things will be fucked up. But that's not a reason to not try. 




 I just made the move, and things got fucked up royally...But while I'm hoping that things get better, I still don't regret doing it... 




 Sounds awesome...But $20 :(

Oh the concerts I'm not going to because of my "Penny wise Pound foolish" policy... 




 I just heard from someone, that it's better to be an asshole with integrity than a nice coward. That's of course, assuming the situation has given you only those choices. 

Otherwise, I completely agree with what you say. 




 Came here to say this -- Chinese Eggplant with Basil Sauce! 




 Maybe I missed something, but how did he know the "teenager" was texting? 




 I think BBC America releases it online the same day as the broadcast now. Not sure because I will be watching it on the 27th anyway. 




 Thank you...that makes sense! 




 Thanks! 




 While I don't agree with you, the fact that the photo doesn't convince you otherwise made me look at the photo critically.

I wanted to convey a feeling of vagueness and uncertainty through the photo. I'm not sure at all if that's coming through.. 









 I came here to say Turkey Run too. I've been camping there too.

Forest Glen is also a good option. If you want to go a little farther (4 hours), Shawnee National Forest is amazing. 




 I'm sorry, but I cried a little there. I wish you the best and hope you make it through. 




 Song of ice and Fire, LOTR, The foundation Series, The Hitchhiker's Guide books, the Space Odyssey Series by Arthur C. Clarke, and anything by Ursula LeGuin

EDIT: Must include Dune in the above list! 




 Been 2 hours, no reply yet. And I'm stuck at work for 2 more hours, so still waiting.. 




 Yeah thanks! I'm the one who's out right now. So I guess, I go back and face the music.. 




 And now I will learn the same lesson, I guess :) 




 Ooh thank you for your logic, LogicalSpider :D It helps that even though I chose email out of cowardice, there might be a small silver lining to it! 




 Oh believe me I tried. And it seems I do have a lack of balls, otherwise why wouldn't I have said anything for a year :) But we'll have to talk about it now...so hopefully the rejection won't be too cruel! 




 Yeah thats the impression I'm getting .. Oh well, my first time! 




 Oh no...I'm hoping we can continue to be friends...or it can't work like that? :O Shit..maybe I should have asked here before the email 




 Oh no, it was a reasonably long email explaining why I took so long and it ended with me saying that we should talk about it ... 




 Well I did say we should talk about it...So I get consolation prize at least .. 




 Yeah true. I did the former...and now it seems like a bad idea! 




 Shit...yeah...but it's been a year...Oh well .. 




 Well it was awkward for me for a long time...so I guess now it will go both ways :) 




 Some showers are good, some not so much I guess... 




 Thanks! 




 Outside 




 You would think  


That if you sat in the bath tub  
Long enough  
With the shower on in full force  


Hot water  
Slowly turning cold  


Your feelings  
All those crazy thoughts  
Would run down  
Your body  


And drain themselves  
With the water  


You would think that  
Wouldnt you?  


But let me tell you  
What really happens  


The water comes  
Hits you  
And then it goes  

  
Well, its water,  
What did you expect?  


Your feelings  
They stay where they are  
After the water is cold  
And you turn off the shower  


Youre the same as before  
Slightly cleaner maybe  
But the same.


 




 You can't replace the beatles drummer. He knew exactly what he was doing, what the song needed and what sounded best:

Example 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axb2sHpGwHQ
Example 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6tV11acSRk

If what you meant that any drummer can play the Beatles songs, then I agree with you. But the band drummer also comes up with the grooves and beats...I think Ringo was a perfect fit for them
 




 Very unusual and well written!  




 Tired, Burnt out  
Where do I go from here  


Hello rock  
Meet my bottom  
Ha ha ha  


Laugh  
Bass guitar plucks on my heart  
I laugh at the...  

The drums start  
Before I complete my thoughts  


Which are slower today  
Because you're in the other lane  
Coming towards me  
Your face going bigger  


I can see the shape of your breasts  
I don't want to look  
No I want to


Hello rock  
Meet my bottom  
Ha ha ha  
 




 Wow...wow..wow.

At first I thought -- Street drummer, is probably just going to play real fast and OP doesn't know anything. Well I'm off my horse! Real musical playing, awesome feel, lots of dynamics, brilliant rolls that aren't just straight Left Right Left Right, a right foot that has a mind of it's own .. a left foot that has brilliant sex the right hand ... 

He better be playing for a real band!! 




 That is way cool! 




 Yes..That was the intent. It was an unexpected moment and I found myself thinking about it days after it happened! 




 Thanks :) 




 
Smile
--------
Her hand was  
Covering her mouth  
As she turned up  
From her book  

And looked at me  
The edges of her lips  
Showed themselves  
From behind her knuckles  
And curled up  
Into a smile

I think the cafe was bright  
And one of the lights  
Was shining in her eyes  

The world stopped  
And then started again 




 Really nice! 




 My friends and I used to use such riddles to play a game. One guy would present a situation and everyone else would ask him question that he could answer only with "Yes", "No" or "Not relevant".

It sounds random, but we almost always got to the right answer within 30 questions. 




 Oh come on, that's just the shadow of the spaceship from Independence day 




 It supposedly works by taking many pics at once with varying degrees of focus, kind of like a compound eye. I wonder if it can zoom. 

Since there are so many mini-lenses, resolution is supposedly a problem. Hopefully they can work that out. 

Awesome concept, really! 




 Oh the Bengal ones sacrifice lots of animals. In the nepal animal sacrifice (which was recently banned, thankfully), thousands of animals are sacrificed at once.

Some of our customs have us cutting a pumpkin and putting red powder in them. This is nothing but a euphemized (okay that's not a word supposedly, but please let it pass) version of animal sacrifice. 




 Yeah, you're right of course :) 

However, it's also important that we don't really have a religious text. Some say the vedas are it (Sanathana Dharma), some say the Bhagavad gita is it (ISKCON), some say there's no text and we're awesome because of it (the moderate ones)....EDIT: To add, there are even some that say that we are not even a religion, only a way of life.  




 Because the facilities suck at all levels. I was in my undergrad team and we had a coach who didn't really care (he wasn't paid much at all, to be fair). Even then, when we once played against a "professional" (equivalent of the third division in other countries) club, we had better uniforms than them. They came to the field by public transport.

There's no money going into soccer. Two of the top clubs in the Indian subcontinent -- Mahindra United and JCT, disbanded recently because of a lack of money. LINK: http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110621/jsp/sports/story_14140274.jsp

And course there's the famous story of the Indian soccer team not going to the world cup because no one sponsored shoes for them. They qualified by default though. 



 




 Oh the caste system exists and is alive and well. People marry in the same caste. People kill for caste. People look away for caste. People get reservations for caste. People get votes for caste. Like you say, the exceptions (us, probably?) don't make the rules

And there are brahmins who eat meat religiously too (fish eaters in the coastal regions), though I agree, they are a minority. I'm a brahmin and I'm vegetarian :) 

Ninja EDIT : I mean, I WAS vegetarian :P 




 Yet there are Brahmins that eat fish (like I mentioned in a different comment). For every "rule" in Hinduism, you will probably find that the opposite is just as true. 




 No. It's religious. There's a lot of pain infliction in our religion. There's even animal sacrifice, though in general cows are left alone and considered sacred for some reason. 




 Umm...actually a lot of Hindus eat meat. Even among those that "do not", some eat fish and classify it as vegetarian. 




 Indian here. Sporting in India deserves a whole other discussion. The national level meets in our country have about as much support and facilities as high school meets here in the US. 




 The pleasures of a pope are none. 




 Depends on what makes you scream. 




 Hey reddit, what determines what kind of pasta will go into a recipe? They all seem to taste the same to me...

I like experimenting with food, so it might help to learn to see the difference! 




 Oh I'm 28 too, don't like what I'm doing, am in a ForeverAlone phase and have no clue what I want to do.

Not sure that helps you in anyway, but if you need company, I'm here! 




 This thread maybe useful:

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hkcmh/what_is_a_great_movie_available_on_netflix_that/

EDIT: Got me through many boring Forever Alone nights! 




 Was this actually posted on some news site or is it more like a warning? 




 Descent!!!! Many hours were spent playing this!

I never made it past Level 9 in Descent 2 without cheat codes. Couldn't find the bloody red keycard! Ten years and I still remember it, was a very traumatic experience! 




 My words  
Are no match for   
The eternal promises  
You are used to  
 




 Added the link to the post...Sorry! 




 I'm not american or extremely knowledgeable, but this article still made me sad. It reminds me of the way I'm angry with my advisor (I'm in grad school), but still have to suck up to him sometimes.

EDIT: Okay, RES screwed with me again...Sorry people, this is the article I was linking to:

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/13/us/politics/13donor.html 




 I can't submit comments while using RES on Chrome. I have to start Firefox (don't have RES installed on that) to comment. DAE have this problem? Is there a fix?

Every time I try, it says "There needs to be something here"..I turned off live preview, but that didn't help

 Thank you very much :) 




 Aah..I don't really have an explanation for this. I was looking at/thinking of the sky when I wrote it -- I'm not sure that helps! 




 Thanks! I'll try to post more poems...hoepfully will get feedback on them as well! 




 Oh really good advice! Reading the poem again, I agree with you completely about the claims to pain and torture, especially the narrow perspective.

Unrelatedly, I don't see how honesty and being-a-dick are related, and you're completely in the former zone! 




 The sky is grey

The morning is blue

There's a knot in my stomach

I'm thinking of you


There's no sense in this

The torture, the pain

There's no question if it's worth it

Because I have nothing else

To be worth anything



In my head

I'm fading out

Losing meaning

Each day

I am less than I was

The day before
 




 Who?  




 Whenever I've seen people fishing, it's been with kids :) Though I've seen them catching fish continuously... 




 I just quit too...because of economic more than health reasons....It's been only a week though, so I can't really say what's happening...

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23919596/ns/health-addictions/t/cant-quit-smoking-blame-your-genes/

The link makes an interesting read...tl;dr -- your chances of quitting and cancer are very strongly linked to your genes 









 There's Homer Lake (Urbana - 20 mins away) and Lake of the Woods (Champaign - 20 mins away) and Clinton Lake (30 mins away) all of which offer fishing. I've seen many people fishing in Homer Lake for sure. Don't know if you need a license...

There's Kickapoo State Park (30 mins) and Turkey run (90 mins) if you're looking to do some Kayaking/Fishing/Boating/Camping

What's a frisbee golf course?

How about a reddit ultimate frisbee meetup? 




 Please do! What'd you do with them? 




 The links say they should be around 100 cm...but these were much smaller...so kids?
 




 Me too Fuck the World For The Win! 




 I've seen them twice now in as many days...I thought they were common, just wanted to check.  They don't really look too dangerous... 




 On the quad side, on the "benches"... 









 We grad students in the apartments get no weed. A pain, I must say 




 Oh I wish I could give you more upvotes for this...Installed and loving it very very much! :D 




 Ignorant foreigner here...what's a dive bar? 




 Good ad agencies then, I must say 




 Hey, 

Sorry for the late reply, but I would totally be up for next semester. I have an electronic drumkit since I live in an apartment..

I am into pretty much everything, from metal to pop and a little bit of hip hop. These days, I'm listening to a lot of jazz and reggae though I haven't really played anything like it. 
 
Really, any kind of music will do. I just want to actually play with people instead of the computer.

-Pritam 




 Captain Obvious to the rescue again! 




 Some of my hair is gray/white and has been for a long time now...I'm 28 and no colors... 




 I'm a drummer! Would love to jam...Maybe we can meet up and try?  




 Okay, should have searched before asking! Found this

http://blog.reddit.com/2009/06/weve-got-mail.html

Now will have to get lots of karma in the hope of nirvana...Exciting! 




 New reddit user here...Don't kill me for asking this, but what is reddit karma and why is it so important? What do you get if you get karma?  




 The axe effect 




 That just means that she wasn't running as fast she could have without falling down. 




 I'm a reddi. I was born reddi.

On further thought, I may have stopped a sentence halfway there. I tend to  




 Yesterday evening, I realized reddit was the greatest website ever when I saw that these two things were on the same page:

1. The hottest youtube video I've ever seen: [Hot youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs8YthlglKk)

2. An AMA with an astronaut: [Astronaut AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gm8rh/iaman_astronaut_who_has_been_to_space_twice_and/)

So the two most important things in life for me were in the same place at the same time...Couldn't ask for much more in a day! 


P.S : I'm still new to the whole reddi 




 Actually, the poem was written in three paragraphs with the same lines as above. When I pasted it onto reddit, the formatting disappeared, and I couldn't get the paragraphs to work.

However, when I reread it, I saw that the paragraphs weren't really adding anything in the sense that everything I wanted to say, I was still saying, so I let it be.

I'm no poet though and I don't know the rules. I just press Enter when I feel a pause in my thoughts to start a new line :) 




 That's a nice quote. I'm no Hemingway, though I could be the boy. Or the fish :) 




 They are an actual wolf and an actual stuffed monkey, not metaphors or anything :)

Thanks! 




 On the sand

By Michigan Lake

And in the forest

By the sand

I thought

Of holding your hand

And walking with you

Instead of beside


After I moved a log

To make way for the queen

I buried my hands

In my sweatshirt

And played with

The lighter



Yes, the same lighter

That refused

To light our cigarettes

And robbed me of that moment

Where I would be sitting with you

Smoking by the lake

Listening to the clamour of the waves




In the curiously romantic

Silence of winter brown trees

I burned your

Stuffed monkeys tail

And felt the

Pleasant distraction

Of the heat on my palm.



You stopped

In your tracks

To look for the wolf



I looked at you

And lit the flame

on my palm again

This is my first poem post here...please criticize freely! 




 Ok wow. I was going to post something similar - actually the same thing. I'm doing my PhD in Aerospace and am currently extremely frustrated. Then I found this...The replies are awesome. Instead of a problem being my first post on reddit, it's a Thank you!
