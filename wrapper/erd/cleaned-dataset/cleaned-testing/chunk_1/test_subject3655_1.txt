 Yeah I was about to say, there's no way you've gotten to college yet. 




 Ah, I was indeed loosely misinterpreting the thread. 




 Um, what were you thinking? Every username I typed in was already taken so my friend said "Just stop, man" So...what exactly were you thinking? 




 Really? Can't that fuck up your teeth? 




 Where is 'snog' used as a word for that? Unless it means something else and I'm wildly misinterpreting this whole thread. 




 Wait...

 My wife knows none of this.

 Not only is this a repost, but its already been reposed in this post's comments twice. Repostception. 




 How much? 




 Blind people of Reddit, how the fuck are you on Reddit? 




 THAT WAS YOU??? 




 Dear lord, should have made a throwaway... 




 No...but...haven't you seen South Park? 




 Good god man, get a hold of yourself! 




 What exactly do you use this account for?

Hence the 'Dallas Diddler'? 




 That seems...excessive. 









 Lets make a thread. I'll start with '1' and the next person choses 2 and 3 and so on. We're coming for you, daddydean...

 Any reason for the chair in the locker? Nice jersey too, but in my mind the chair mystery is really stealing the show right now. 




 Either [Save Tonight] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nntd2fgMUYw) or [Away and Anywhere] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXBjn2s8ofQ). Its weird, they both calm me down and get me pumped up at the same time. No idea how to explain it.

 No, probably not. 




 There was a joke in 'The Interview' that says somthing along the lines of "Don't shake his hands, hes a Jew" I saw the joke coming and realized that the three other people me and my friend were watching it with were very Jewish. Not just a little Jewish. Anyways the joke comes along and my friend lets lose the loudest laugh of the entire movie. He claims it wouldn't have been awkward if anyone else laughed, but no one did. It was awkward as fuck. 




 I just saw you answered today, but reading this shit really isn't worth my time. To be honest I can't believe your still going down swinging about all this, you were wrong a long time ago. Are you incredibly stubborn, or do you really have nothing better to do than keep arguing online in this sad lonely life of yours? Probably both I suppose. Anyhow, its getting too tiring correcting you countless mistakes and inaccuracies, so log off and go away. You gave it a good shot, but you lost. By a lot. By the way, the log off button is on the upper right side of the screen. I know how fragile your mind is and wouldn't want you to have a brain aneurysm trying to find it.

 Not an 'official' word? Sorry Dr. Seuss, but there's no such thing as an 'official' word, there are words and there are letters put together in groups. You yourself provided an excellent example of this, 'commenter' I believe you called it. I suppose though, if you really want to use your 'unofficial' language, I can direct you to what I like to call ['The Dictionary of High School Dropouts'] (http://www.waywordradio.org/Official_Dictionary_of_Unofficial_English-Grant-Barrett-0071458042.pdf), even in there though I don't think you'll find 'commenter'.

Also, it's a good barometer to see when someone is losing an argument when they stoop to nitpicking word usage.

A barometer is a meteorology device, not an standard by which to measure debates. See what I did there? Probably not. Anyhow do you know what nitpick means? It means to be excessively concerned with or critical of inconsequential details. So are you saying that your looking up the definition of your fake word wasn't nitpicking? Are you saying the defining an already meaningless word and proving its nonexistence wasn't nitpicking? Because either you just used the word nitpicking wildly incorrectly, or you yourself nitpicked, which-by your own admission-is the sign of someone (in this case you) losing an argument. So which is it? Are you wrong *again* or are you losing the argument? Now that I think about it, I suppose it could easily be both.

As for irony, I said it because you have repeatedly said I lack intelligence, when it is clear to even the untrained eye that it is in fact you who is the real unintelligent fool.

The only thing I can say about this sentence is that it is the most grammatically fucked up thing I've seen in a long while.

It was getting embarrassing, I'm glad you saw that. I still can't believe you thought a defensive player was one of the Patriots top recivers! Truly pathetic. The good news is, you've admitted you embarrassing blunder and can move forward with a new lesson learned.

If you really want to pick back up your retarded football talk I'm more than willing, you just seemed to be falling behind. A debate is no fun when I need to keep going back to explain things to you. In fact, I didn't even read your last comment on football. I can only assume it was filled with factual and grammatical errors and inaccuracies. Not that I expected any more from you. Tell me, do people always have to dumb it down for you, or only when your talking about football and other subjects you've barely even heard of? Grammar for example. 




 So my comment is gone, not sure why, maybe it was deleted. I needed to used some truly harsh language to capture your personality and intelligence quotient, I can't help but think the mods didn't appreciate that. Or maybe they could see you were losing you battle by a landslide and decided to put you out of your misery. Either way, here's no way in hell your worth typing that out a second time (or even a first time for that matter, I guess I was just feeling nice :), your welcome). So I guess your just not getting an answer unless the mods give it back. Sorry to disappoint, I know how much you love getting proven wrong. Why else would you say such stupid things?? A tout a l'heure.

EDIT: Nah, I need to put you out of your misery myself. Its the least I can do for such an unfortunate child such as yourself-tell me, how was it to grow up without an education? I'll respond later, but I'm sure you won't like it. If you're asking for it though, fine by me. 









 Your the best! 




 Amendola was brought in to replace Welker, who had 1000 yard seasons with over 100 catches. Amendola wasn't even close to those numbers.

If you think that Bill Belichick tried to replace Wes Welker with Danny Amendola your a bigger idiot than I thought. He brought in a new receiver, period. Why wouldn't you call Donald Jones Wes Welker's replacement? Or Aaron Dobson? Or Josh Boyce? Or Michael Jenkins? Or Jake Ballard? Because they all came in when Welker left, so why is the burden supposed to lie on Danny Amendola? That's some retarded logic your're trying to argue with. Just because they came in at the same time, they must be trading off rolls? If anything, Juilian Edleman is Wes Welkers 'replacement'. Not sure why you thought Amendola was.

He has 3 good games in 2 years. I think your definition of great is a little off.

If you think he's only had three good games in two years, well your already a bigger idiot than I thought. Your a bigger idiot than the bigger idiot I thought you were before? Eh, its redundant, I'm sure you and your general lack of intelligence will prove me wrong again. As for Amendola, he hasen't played much more than three games. Obviously not three whole games, that's not the way Bill Belichick plays his players. He takes them for a reason, for example Blount's power running on third downs or Gonkowski's inside routs in the red zone. He plays them for specific plays, not all of them. The way you keep talking seems like you think every player plays every snap. If you ran an NFL team, dear god they'd be in trouble. This isn't something I should have to explain to you, literally team does this, it's a very easily comprehended part of football. Try to keep up.

That is one of the worst comparisons I have ever seen. I appreciate the try, but goddamn dude, you need to learn how to make an argument.

See, this is why your worse at making an argument than I am. You don't respond to what I said, you respond to the way I said it. Who gives a shit how I said it? My underlying thesis doesn't change, but unfortunately you missed that because you didn't like 'my comparison'. Was my point weather or not a comparison was good? No. Then why do you feel the need to waste time going off on a pointless tangent? Maybe it's because you don't have an answer, so you're changing the subject. Hope not, that would just be depressing. I hope your keeping notes, it might be good for you to know how to carry on a debate some day.

Nope, not even close. It was a counterpoint to you? saying that Brady makes all his receivers great. Rookies or not, they under performed.

Since when is 466 yards and 4 touchdowns in your first season in the NFL 'under-preforming'? And Dobson did even better, 519 yards and 4 touchdowns. Obviously its not something you'd want to see out of a third or fourth year player, but first?? That's not under-preforming, hell he could have been sitting on the bench as a back up and he wouldn't have been under-preforming as a rookie. Get your head out of your ass, these are some very solid rookie years. Go ahead, disagree with that. I didn't think your stupidity was expanding but you've surprised me before.

Are you seriously basing your entire argument that Tom Brady can make anyone look like a star, on one comment from Christain Fauria?

Ha! You made me actually laugh out loud, that's rich! Every time you say something it seems I think 'Wow, I didn't think he could prove himself any more of an idiot, but I'll be damned, I was wrong'. Of course I'm not basing an argument off of Christain fucking Fauria-do you even know who that is?? I did however use his quote as a source to support my argument. Debate 101, maybe you should take it. Jesus Christ this is exhausting trying to get through to people like you. Going back and explaining every sentence is like talking to a six year-old. Literally.


By the way, mentioning Matthew Slater was a test to see if you have any idea what your talking about. Clearly you don't. Slater plays DEFENCE. Didn't catch that.

Did I need to?

YES, YOU SHOULD FUCKING KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OFFENCE AND DEFENSE. How can you even try to carry on a debate about football when you don't know the two?? Its not a mind game at all, but rather a very simple and transparent test to see of you have any idea what your taking about or not. Turns out, your full of shit. I still can't believe that you argued against me by saying a defensive player has bad reviving yards. That's more than pathetic.

You think you are some witty commenter with all the right comments, but you haven't even come close to anything right this entire time.

Nice. No seriously good one, give yourself a pat on the back for that zinger. And it would even make sense too if 'commenter' was a word and if it was the least bit true. *You're* the one I have to keep correcting, and you don't even seem to understand half the shit your saying. It's come to the point where I've considered leaving you to your blissful yet idiotic ignorance, but I'm a charitable person, I keep returning to educate you. Push you luck though and your going to end up one very moronic 'football expert'. Even saying that sarcastically insults the real moronic football experts of the world, your much worse than that. You were right about one thing though, Matthew Slater is not a very good receiver. 




 Okay so I guess you officially give up on what this entire debate was about in the first place, I'll put one in the win column and move on to what ever asinine point you want to debate next.

Your whole argument is flawed, because its based on the point that I'm somehow defending the Patriots in this whole ball-deflation thing. I'm not. At all.

What I am defending however this the just system of due process. So until there is an official statement from the NFL announcing 'the Patriots cheated' no, I do not call that cheating. Why you ask? First of all the sources that supply this information are rarely sound. The guy that announced this whole deflation issue in the first place said that the Patriots used illegal balls and equipment. Clearly this was a very distorted image of the truth, and if is these people were relying upon, we can't take anything they say for anywhere close to certian.

Second, well...do you even know how game process works with regards to the game balls? They are delivered to the stadium where they are opened by a sealed container *by the referees* where they are marked *by the referees* to prevent someone from replacing them. Then they are filled with air *by the referees* and measured *by the referees* who's responsibility it is to take care of them until game time. The only time the footballs are under the control of one of the teams is on the field during the game. You might say 'Well ha! Got you! The Patriots probably deflated the balls just before or during the game!' but you'd be wrong. Inflating and deflating the game balls requires equipment that is simply not available on the field. Anyone seen taking 12 footballs to a machine pushed off to the side would clearly be seen, if not in person than on video. The only other way to deflate them would be to take a knife to the footballs. Probably not what happened. My point is that there is almost no chance for the teams to get a hold of the balls to somehow alter them before the game. There is a very good chance that there was an error made by someone employed by the NFL (probably a referee) that brought the footballs down two pressurized pounds.

My point was never that messing with the game balls wasn't cheating, my point was that there is a lot left unsaid and that even if the Patriots were found to be 100% guilty, it would still be a non-issue. 




 LaFell was already a good receiver? Does that make Danny Amendola a good receiver? Because last year when LaFell was 'already good' he got 627 yards. Danny Amendola, who 'isn't even doing decent' got 633 yards last year. So which is it? Was he 'already good' or was Amendola not only on par with him but arguably better? Get your facts straight and stop contradicting yourself, it's exhausting cleaning up someone your messes.

And Danny Amendola hasn't under preformed at all, in fact when he's on the field he's been doing great. Unfortunately for him though, he's gone almost completely unused. How can you say he's under-preforming when he doesn't play? That's like saying jimmy Garoppolo (Brady's backup) sucks because he only got 100 yards. The person expecting him to get more yards is the idiot in this scenario, not the other way around.

As far as the rookies go, care to name them just to be sure were all on the same page? I think we are for the most part but I wouldn't want us to be addressing completely separate people. Who says their best isn't minimal numbers though? Is your point that rookies can't suck? Just because they're drafted doesn't mean they're good by any means. Unless they're a first or early second round pick, it only means that they could potentially have potential, there is no where close to a guarantee that they are good.

But hey! Guess what! You got something right! Michael Hoomanawanui (for future reference, that's how you spell it) doesn't have good numbers. You know why I chose him? I chose him very deliberately. I chose him because my point was that Brady can turn anyone into a star. Christian Fauria said, and I quote, "These people don't know his name yet, but Tom Brady's making him look like a star out there tonight". My point was never that Hoomanawanui had thousand yard seasons, to be honest I don't even know where you got that from. Keep your eye on the ball 'corby'.

By the way, mentioning Matthew Slater was a test to see if you have any idea what your talking about. Clearly you don't. Slater plays *DEFENCE*. Didn't catch that? He has one recorded reception *EVER*. And you think I'm the one that failed, ha! You have the entire internet at your disposal, but even that wasn't enough to get your head out of your ass. But hey, nice job 'shutting me down'. Don't worry corby, you'll get em' next time.



EDIT: Sorry, I couldn't bear giving you that false hope at the end. Sorry corby, but you actually probably won't get em' next time. Maybe if you lose the suborn ignorance and your debate is against an idiotic five year-old you'll win one, but even then I'm not 100% sure. 




 I'll take your slight redirction as a full surrender. As I was saying, non-issue. But if you don't have any response to what I said before, I understand. Now you can either admit defeat, come up with a reasonable counterpoint (good luck) or try to desperately change the subject. *Again*. 




 Can you make this but with Revis in black and white? That would look dramatic as fuck, please! 




 You can creep on me if you want. Curious of what my internet preception is. 




 You meaning me? No, I didn't break any rules. Not sure why your addressing me personally.

If you mean 'the Patriots didn't break the rules' no, that's not what I'm saying at all-did you even read what I said? What I'm saying is that the entire ball deflation thing is a non-issue. Clearly regardless of what happened didn't change the outcome of the game, hell they could have been playing with Nerf footballs and it wouldn't have changed the outcome of the game, but there are many more 'issues' in the NFL that are getting ten times less attention just because the teams involved aren't headline attention grabbers.

In summary, there are many issues and non-issues in the NFL, this falls under the non-issue category. 




 Really? Again? Matthew Slater, Brandon LaFell and Michael Hoomanawanui to name a few.

To be honest I can't tell if your making my point about Danny Amendola or not. My point is Ameldola has been doing decent considering how much time hes spent actually on the field, but all in all he's not a very good receiver (which anyone who knows anything about Danny Amendola is aware of), and that Tom Brady doesn't have much to work with with regards to a receiving core...which you confirmed for me as if you were some how proving me wrong by supporting my point... Whatever.

And my point about the rookies is we can't tell if they're better under Tom Brady or not because we haven't seen them under any other circumstances. How the hell would we know if Tom Brady brings out their best if we haven't seen them with any other quarterbacks? For all we know, that *is* their best.

Do *you* know what your talking about? Because it certainly doesn't seem like it when I have to spell everything out for you. 




 Okay, you want to talk about really cheating? 'Flat out cheating'? Blow-deflated-footballs-out-of-the-water cheating?

http://phins.com/chris/column_050908.html

Is that not enough? I'll dig out more if you have another 'counter point' but the fact is that people simply don't care if the teams involved aren't winning. Period. If not, explain to me why the Patriots were the only team that got any attention for taping other teams when others were caught doing the same exact things and then some? And why are people still talking about it despite more recent scandals with even more definitive proof involving other teams? Because they aren't winning, so it must not be news. 




 Amendola is doing decent, and the two rookies are rookies. My point is he brings out the absolute best potential in his players and has the ability to make even a bad receiver look like a star. I'm not saying they're all bad receivers by any means, but he makes them look a hell of a lot better. 




 Wow, last year but same people! I would love to have that job every season... 




 The Jets got caught recording opponent's signals a year before SpyGate, did anyone care? No. The Raiders were known for over inflating footballs beyond their legal limit (as are the Packers apparently), does anyone care now? Nope. The Lions ran multiple deceptive plays where they threw to a lineman as an eligible receiver *this year*, did anyone bat an eye?? No one.

Apparently there are many "non-issues" going on, just involving poor franchises. They've all been caught but did you hear about it? Nope. Did you hear about it before there was even an ounce of proof that the Patriots did it? Absolutely.

If the NFL is willing to catch and release like that its clearly a non-issue. Just because a big team supposedly does what the little teams are doing shouldn't make it any more or less of an issue. They've all been caught, but no one cares until a winning team might be involved. If it's an issue, than the little teams should be addressed just as harshly by the NFL and the media as the big teams. If not, then it's simply a not an issue. 




 I don't know, I really like [NFL on CBS] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idNhIdw2Bpo).

EDIT #2: How did I forget [March Madness] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhC5-uIJJWQ)?!! 




 Even though Tom Brady didn't have the records the past few years, I still think hes the best. I mean most great quarterbacks have an arsenal of receivers to chose from to make their stat sheet look good, not Brady. Who does he have this year? The list starts and ends with Rob Gronkowski. Everyone else is decent to average. Despite this, Tom Brady makes them look good. Brandon LaFell? Matthew Slater? Even Julian Edelman? These guys aren't stars by any means, but under Tom Brady everyone is turned into a dangerous weapon. Even when he doesn't have a team, Tom Brady takes them to the playoffs every year. Literally, every. Singe. Year. That's why hes the best. Well, one of the reasons. 




 Thats a big *IF*. Where do these allegations come from anyways? Did a Colts fan decide Sunday night "45-7? Must be trickery! Get Roger on the phone!" The media's reception of sports scandals always reminds me of the Salem witch trials. Someone is accused of something and then with out a trial or so much as proof suddenly they're guilty. Maybe I should accuse Russel Wilson of greasing Barndon Bostick's gloves (hes the guy who dropped that onside kick), just to even the playing field. 




 You still want New England?? 47-7... If I were you I would want a win, not a risk.

 Even with the tags, I don't think you should post stuff like this unless you specify how gigantic a spoiler it is in the title or until it at least happens in the show.

 For some reason the contractor that designed my house put the door bell in the bathroom. I've had many an electrician try to fix it, but apparently the single wire going from my front door to the bathroom is absolutely vital to the structural integrity of the entire house. I wouldn't mind the door bell, its usually not that bad when your not in the bathroom. When you are though...you know how you jump out of your seat when theres a BANG! in a scary movie? Similar concept, very different end result. Its come to the point where Im scared to shit in my own home. This house has taken the most basic of human rights from me...

Ive been collecting it for a few years now, very proud of what I have so far. I have a few more Im working on finishing that are missing a few autographs. Anyone know Kirk Hammett? Ive been trying to track him down since 2008...

 Singers make songs all the time that claim they've done drugs, stolen, assaulted, etc. yet no one ever gets arrested for that. And in Anthony Keidis' (Red Hot Chili Peppers singer) autobiography he talks about a life full of illagal drug and substance abuse, yet he's probably never even been questioned by the police (well...). Hell theres videos on Youtube of Wiz Khalifa smoking weed! I'm pretty sure though that if I was caught with a recording or self-written note admiting to any type of crime that I would be arrested on the spot, so why aren't they?

EDIT: I don't necessarily want to see any of these people prosecuted, I'm just curious why they arn't.
