 yet in the episode where they go to Bob's Funland, there's a flashback where all three are making fun of Bob in highschool! 




 AHH I came here to say the bacon stretcher one. I guess that's been around for a while.

But my favorite of all time is to send the new dishwashers downstairs to grab a gallon of "striped paint." 




 god damn, I never want to read another thing by a middle schooler. 




 there is no evidence. 




 Wow... This just makes me feel old. 




 uhh... it was a hyped up new technology? 




 aha, well I did some research...

 Is that a cicada killer? 




 huh? Oh, I'm sorry I couldn't hear you over your smugness.

here you are.

Granted, Romney takes the liar cake. But Obama had a few slices himself. 




 is it true you gave yourself brain damage from holding your breath so frequently? 




 whatever happened to letting the haters hate? 

oh, and while I don't advocate for racism:
excuse to use the word freely.

There is no "excuse" to use words freely. There is simply the freedom to use **any** word.  




 Oh I'm sorry mate. I just meant that it's really horrible to have to include shitty old things like hit counters. No disrespect intended. 

You should just use google analytics instead. 




 are you looking to just display this as a full page embedded vid? Or, are you trying to make a background image into a video? 




 ugh. That's really horrible. 




 waitwait, sexual harassment? There is a very clear line between being forward and harassing someone.
Legally speaking, I suppose. I mean, she could go around telling people that you're a pig... but, honestly wtf cares? 




 This is the problem with nice/shy guys. They use that as an excuse for being a pussy. 




 god damn. poor poor bastard 




 "is that what a real man looks like?" 




 Life will make you into a cynical asshole yet. 




 False. I am talking about that word being used as a general pejorative.

Your argument is based on the idea that this word is no longer a homophobic slur. That is patently false.

you contradict yourself to make a point, and then you mention honesty about the meaning of the word. I don't know what this honesty is meant to refer to, a literal definition of the word or its connotations? 
The use of faggot as a pejorative is an augmentation of its once literal definition anyway. And emotional reactions to the word have everything to do it. If the word Faggot didn't inspire negative emotions in people then we wouldn't be having this conversation to begin with. 

and a correction: I know the word still can be used as a homophobic slur, that's not my argument. I'm saying that it is also taking on a new meaning, one that denotes -- as you said -- a general pejorative. Not a specific homophobic slur. 

EDIT: and for these reasons, you're argument is tautological. 




 The use of homophobic slurs is homophobic.

The argument: that this use of the word in a certain context is in fact not homophobic.

Your argument assumes the correctness of "faggot" always being used as a homophobic slur. It even goes so far as to imply that if **both** user and target have reached an agreement previously to not treat "faggot" as homophobic, but instead as part of their vocabulary of playful denigration, it still is a homophobic slur. 

If this were the case, all words would remain static. This is clearly not so. Also, I think it's pretty clear that a community such as reddit is by nature very opposed to homophobia. This establishes a sort of redefinition of what it means to use words previously defined as homophobic slurs. 

AND, one more thing. Words are words and only people give them power to hurt. If you treat "faggot" with such seriousness, it only deems the word necessary when spouting vitriol. Much like the word nigger has been used. The best thing to do is use the word with utter farce, lampoon it's own hateful meaning.

simply put. 
and plus, your arguments are full of tautologies, because they're full of tautologies. That, and some obligatory reference to civil rights.  




 I would give a body part to get a sequel to the original FFT on the ps3. 




 I mean, not like shaved clean. Like, babybottom kind of shaved.

But bro, you got to trim that shit up. 




 Ok, I'm sorry. 

But the people on here telling you to confront your mother and threaten to tell your father can go fuck themselves. Well, perhaps not that. But I think it is the wrong way to approach the situation. This is based off of the principle that this is none of your business. Just be an adult and talk to her. Keep it between you and her. Get her perspective. It is most likely the case that there is some dynamic between your father and mother that is completely unknown to you. Affairs happen, this is just part of real life. Don't go bulldozing through your family just because you're too offended that your mother wants a proper dicking from some other guy.

I understand this comes across as harsh. Hopefully it isn't taken as malicious. 




 Russian. I love the way russian sounds. It also makes you better at tricking people. 




 lee scoresby from his dark materials 




 reading that was like getting sand in my eyes. 




 so instead they just hang themselves... nbd 




 Well, this was a big waste of time. 




 nobody panic, jawathehutt is doing research on it. 




 Honestly, I hate to be that guy... but I hate it when people start packing until the prof says "see yah later" or the equivalent of such. 




 I don't get anything. But this kid I used to work with in the kitchen was named Craig. And somehow, it became a thing that everybody would say "C'mon craig, how you gonna get fired on your day off?"

This was unappreciated 




 do you feed him lasagna? 




 Idontbelieve 




 your professors don't care about you. 




 hum... Surprised I am that this is on front page and not controversial. +1 for you sir, even if this is a repost ;) 




 Any toy for my kids is a huge waste of money

are you Louis CK? 




 Again, wrong.

Modern philosophy is *not* applied psychology. What you may be referring to is Naturalized Philosophy, which is a specific branch of philosophy. And even then, it's not so much applied psychology as it is applied "let's accept some empirical facts about the world"

Modern science is by definition a conglomeration of facts based off of a philosophical framework. Much like Aristotelian physics and the geocentric model, the standard model and quantum physics. 

Not all philosophy is speculative, in the same way that some fields of scientific research *are* speculative. 

I'm not here to make value judgements. There is no "better than the other." But I'm also going to give philosophy it's credit where credit is due. A lot of people forget the history that Philosophy and Science have together. They used to be in love, you know. 




 thank you. 




 I encourage this discussion. Especially when alcohol is involved. 




 There is so much awesome in this. 




 This is really untrue. There is fathoms more to Philosophy than  the subjectivity of the human condition. 
Not too long ago, Science was a proper branch of philosophy. 
Also, logic and analytic philosophy. These are found at the foundations of the scientific method and formally part of the philosophical tradition.

In other words, philosophy embodies almost all fields of study. Even mathematics.  




 ya man, I second this. I mean, it sucks that you threw away all of your old work, but it all has to do with perspective. You could look at it in a liberating kind of way... In the sense that you're no longer bound to what you've created in the past.

This might sound like a load of bullshit. But it's either that, or live in the turmoil of knowing you don't have some stuff you made in highschool. Im not into the visual arts myself, but I have two really really good friends (one painter, one illustrator) that are both out of college. And they are both terribly embarrassed of what they did in highschool. Not in an ashamed way, just a "oh wow, I've improved so much" kind of thing. 

...So yeah, keep at it bro. 




 ya. And then get downvoted into oblivion for pointing it out on a popular one.

 mmm good old bagged milk? 




 This is not so much a problem if said girl had a nice ass* and you were staring at it. 




 really puts a plot hole in the whole episode... 




 this is true. 




 nono, it was. 




 You are a giant faggot. I don't even know why I read the comments any more. The fact that the author got downvoted for explaining why they did something blows my fucking mind.  




 bravo, kind sir. 




 yup 




 this is a poorly worded question. 




 cowboy bebop, samurai champloo, full metal alchemist: brotherhood.
watch these, and you won't be able to stop. 




 oh my god. I can here to say exactly this! 




 OH! 




 perhaps plot is the wrong word.  




 meh. Not so hot, not so cold. 




 Dude, if you want to use leaves to wipe your ass, then more power to you. 

I, personally, enjoy the better things that the economic society has produced, not just luxury. For example, modern culture.  

You can go live in the woods, grow you're own food and make houses out of sticks and stones. I'll be busy reading books. 




 yes, yes there was. 




 meh. In my opinion, anybody who isn't interested in the plot of Cowboy Bebop or FLCL is plain toast in my book.

Now, if you're going to go and start talking to people about Inuyasha or Naruto, then that's a different story entirely. 




 this picture is so old, why is this on the front page of reddit? blahblahblah, and other complaints. 




 Im gonna bet my money on Java. 




 stay away from adderall.
 




 oh ya? 




 This is a stupid question. 
If it was done forcefully, absolutely not.
If your girlfriend didn't mind, then who gives a shit?

Homosexuality has nothing to do with invading the space of other human beings. 




 can we get some sources in this motherfucking thread? 




 This is a typical 16 year old response. 




 they're probably just predetermined at the start of a battle. In which case, who cares. Still semi-random, just not in the "in the moment" kind of way. 




 I can't belive this got downvoted so much 




 let me tell you why this is bullshit:
There's no way the farmer can completely sustain himself. 
Let's assume he's using simple tools (hoe, axe, rake etc..) He either needs to greatly increase his work time, or greatly increase his manpower for maintenance on the farm.
If he is doing this by himself, he very little time to do anything else (harvest the crops, store them, sleep, eat, be human). 
If he has extra workers, what compensation do they receive? Let's assume there is no money, and that they are paid in the crops that are grown. Then that means more food has to be grown for each new worker we introduce. Even if none of these people had family members that didn't work on the farm this would be a challenging task.

On top of that, and I know it sounds silly, but where did he get his house, his hat, his clothes, and (in the picture) his little grill? Let's ignore the grill. How did he build his house? He doesn't have time for that he's too busy using hand tools to grow enough food for the year. Did he pay for it with crops?
Ah, so now we have some people that build houses and some people that grow vegetables. When one wants to eat, they *trade* skills for food, and vice-versa when the other needs shelter.
This extends outward, and gets increasingly complex. Which is why we have money in the first place, because in order to maintain any basic standard of living (even the most conservative) it is next to impossible to do anything without trade. And if we're trading crops for houses, we might as well have this universal medium so we can get things from people that don't want houses or crops without going through a long list of trading to get something else; say, honey, toilet paper, cars, pencils, straw hats or little tiny grills.
 




 true. and that 0.01% stays there because being a nice guy is the equivalent to being a single-mom. 




 super nintendo gets my vote 




 shut up, faggot. 




 You shouldn't be riding your bike on the sidewalk sir. 




 take that global warming nuts! 




 hey hey, I sympathize... Sometimes you gotta stand like a total d-bag to get a drink these days.  




 they're trying to build a prison, for you and me to live in...

srry, oblig system of a down quote 




 Doug Funny, clearly. 




 A+ 




 the big dipper 




 This is actually a type of ghost. To find a pet peeve, you'll need to get your hands on a very scientific device. My guess is that most people who claim to have one are lying, as most cannot actually "see" a peeve, but must experience one. 




 Yeah, I feel that. If I am in to her, I usually just assume flirting. Flirting and friendliness can be very similar anyway. Just because I girl is flirting with you doesn't mean she's going to have sex with you.
