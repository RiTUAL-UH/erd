 Hmm, where is that? I'm using KitKat also (AOKP ROM). 




 Just tried that. Blocks calls fine, but messages gets through. 




 What, in your opinion, is the best way to completely block unwanted calls / SMS of unknown / unwanted callers?

I'm using Call Filter. The problem is that it doesn't block the call, it just rejects it (like pressing No/red button). So, if i'm near my phone, i can see the screen going on. Also, my provider sends me a text message of a missed call (cause, you know, that what he thinks this is, after Call Filter rejection). So, i get notified no matter what.

As for the SMS messages, i"m yet to find a way to block them. Call Filter doesn't block, they get through. The only way is by mutting the conversation on Hangouts. But i get to see the message eventually, so that's not a solution.

Any solution is more than welcomed.

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: I'm using a Galaxy Nexus with Android 4.4.2 KitKat. 









 ... and that there is an entire sub for it.

Spyros Panagiotis Skouras was born on 27 September, 1892 at Skourahorian, Greece, the son of a local sheepherder. After initially studying for the priesthood, Skouras, with the help of his older brother, [error], joined his younger brother, George P. Skouras, and traveled to America. While working as a bus boy in St. Louis, Skouras would spend his nights studying English, business practices, accounting and law. In 1912 the three brothers pooled their money and purchased a rundown nickelodeon in a poor neighborhood in St. Louis. After turning the theater around the brothers were able to build on their success and borrow $150,000 to buy and refurbish the old Grand Central Theater in St. Louis. Eventually the Skouras brothers would go on to control 650 theaters spanning coast to coast.

Skouras, along with his brother George joined the Army Signal Corps during the First World War. After the war they returned to St. Louis and their theater interests.

The Skouras brothers sold their theater franchise in 1928 to Warner Brothers where Skouras and his younger brother George were made officers in the company. Charles Skouras went on to become president of National Theaters Inc. In 1931 Skouras left Warner's to work for Paramount and the following year was lured away to take over Fox Metropolitan Theaters in New York, which was loosing a million dollars a year. He was able save the franchise from bankruptcy and by 1942 was in a position to take over the presidency of 20th Century-Fox. During his tenure as president Skouras is credited with embracing cinemascope technology in an attempt to save the movie industry from the growing competition from television. By early 1960s, mounting losses compounded by the 30 million over-budget production of Cleopatra (1963), led to Skouras being forced out. He remained on as chairman of the board though, retiring in 1969 to devote more time to his shipping line business, Prudential -Grace Lines.

Skouras died of a heart at his home in Mamaroneck, NY on 16 August, 1971. He was survived by his wife of 51 years, the former Saroula Bruiglia, two daughters and two sons.

 "Greece is full of sun and sea, so people there are happy. "

Wrong. There is a lot of unhappiness and grumpy faces in my country, mainly due to unemployment and the ongoing "economic crisis".  But we try. Sun and sea is good, but won't solve your problems.

 Thanks, but there are annotations that i want to see, not disable them all because someone wants to force things. 




 Please, stop putting annotations to the edge of the screen, on a position where it hides the X button. That's not cool. I won't click on you banner no matter what. How is this even allowed from Google? 




 On this day, 21 April 1967, a group of colonels overthrew the Greek government and declared martial law. Junta lasted 7 years and ended on 24 July 1974.

This is a photo of the Athens Polytechnic uprising, a massive demonstration of popular rejection of the Greek military junta which started on 1973 and essentially led to the fall of the dictatorship.

The banners write "Freedom" and "Freedom to the students".
