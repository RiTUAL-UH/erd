 Have you looked in the settings for the messages app? For some reason it isn't enabled by default.  




 If you're planning to root and ROM, I'd go the GS2 because its a little cheaper and has better almost everything except screen. If you're going to stay stock then it's definitely Nexus, no comparison. 




 Probably running a custom rom. Guessing from the "swagger" toggle, it looks like AOKP with a themechooser theme. 




 In all honesty, if you want to get your hands on new updates as soon as they come out and you don't have a nexus device, you better be prepared to root. It's either root, or wait. 




 Custom shortcuts in the nav bar? Nope, it's [AOKP!](http://justreboot.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/jt_aokp1.jpg) 




 The new notification shade looks... amazing. 









 Galaxy S2. 




 What about people with unsupported devices but are using unofficial builds? :( 




 No. You cannot uninstall system apps without root, regardless of what launcher you use. 




 Incorrect, this will only allow you to uninstall userspace apps. Many bloatware apps are put on the system partition of the phone and cannot be removed without root access (eg try to remove stock messaging or contacts - even though they are not bloatware they are system apps and you will see what I mean) 




 There are plenty of ports on the SGS xda forums, it only takes a few hours for some of the devs to port over new builds once they've been posted. [Here's what I'm using.](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1712185) 




 Juice defender or tasker? 




 It can handle up to 32gb, just not moving or copying anything over that's larger than 4gb at any given time.  




 A cat meowing?

 I think you're forgetting the important fact that Google voice is nowhere near being internationally available. They can't merge functionality on an os that reaches all over the world, when that functionality is only available in a few select places. Until voice is universal it has to be a separate app.  




 Yay, this post again! Seriously, if you don't like an app then why have it installed?  




 Yes right now CM7 has way more features than 9, but that is because of the CM team's choice to focus on stability and clean code before features - there were posts saying that some features in CM7 were "dirty hacks", and they're doing everything a much cleaner way this time round, so features will be slow. In the meantime I suggest an AOKP-based rom, as they have more features atm. 




 Fyi cm9 nightlies are pretty damn stable.  




 I read somewhere that once the battery drops below 5% you have to boot into webos to get it to charge.  




 The development scene for the i9100 is more at xda.  




 Reddit news is awesome, but its not flawless. (I'm using it now) Alien Blue just feels so nice to use.  




 But none of them have the polish that Alien Blue does.  




 Strangely enough this actually never happened to me. The worst its done is refuse to load content and a force-kill and reopen usually fixes that. 

And if you don't like a piece of software, nobody is forcing you to use it.  




 Flash a stock rom with Odin.  




 Well it certainly seems that way haha. Tell me, how is Verizon's new data plans relevant to Android? Sure, you use Android to access the internet but posting about it here makes about as much sense as posting about new cable infrastructure in r/windows. 




 In a single country. Everywhere else it doesn't apply. 




 Oh, we're still doing this joke? 




 I watched The Shawshank Redemption for the first time ever a few days ago. 




 While we're at it, can we lose the carrier posts that have NOTHING to do with android? 




 Not defending the people that do suggest it, just giving some insight on why they do. :) 




 Come and join us on the dark side, [AOKP](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20526467/Screenshot_2012-06-12-20-56-54.png). (its only green because its currently charging, is otherwise blue.) 




 While valid for Nexus devices, which come with vanilla Android out-of-the-box, I think a lot of the root/rom suggestions stems from the fact that fans of the platform don't want a users view of Android poisoned by a shitty manufacturer UI - I know a lot of people that have HTC phones and they complain about bug X and not being able to do feature Y, which, upon further inspection turns out to be because of shitty, bloated sense. 




 Its a feature that a lot of custom roms have, namely CM9 and AOKP. 




 Solid explorer has all this. You don't even need to install the app to know that, its right there in the description... don't simply dismiss things immediately, investigate.  




 To build a home - cinematic orchestra 




 What features does Solid explorer lack in comparison to your current one? I find it suits all my needs, its very functional.  




 Slim ics is available for the Gnex also.  




 Its simply because the devs didn't code it into the app.  




 Hey look everyone, this guy doesn't have **Facebook!**  




 Also comes with some pretty sweet wallpapers.  




 I think I may be the only one who picked up on the [reference.](http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/bluesclues.asp) Unless it was unintentional...

 How do you do it though? I'm trying to place one on top of the other and it just moves to the nearest available space. I'm using the free version.  




 Uninstall the CF3D binary, and then remove the app completely.  




 As long as custom roms exist, the android phone will always be dependent on the computer.  




 The only thing stopping me from completely swapping over to Reddit Sync is comment editing/deleting!

 Thank you so much! I've been experiencing this issue for a while now! 




 What's the benefit of using this over an ad-hoc network which can be done with your laptop/computer already? 




 As a person currently suffering from depression, fuck you. Do you mean to say that the fighting it has taken me to still be alive to type this out is meaningless? Depression is a cancer of the mind and soul, and there have been studies that show *physical manifestations* of depression in the brain. What gives you the authority to dismiss scientific studies on this *life altering disease*?  




 I think that per-app DPI requires some serious hacks and modifications to the android framework itself. I don't think its possible without a custom rom, unfortunately.  




 Ah that makes more sense. Thank you for explaining. :) 




 Why don't you just have it utilize the Share function instead? That way you can simply hand over the information to wherever they want to share it (ie if they want to share it via some other messaging service).? 




 Only thing I'm waiting on for this app is comment editing/deleting.  




 I enjoyed the remade multiplayer. But I wish they kept both versions. And the Xbox version was more censored. :( 




 Not until reading this thread did I realize that this company is responsible for my childhood... 




 I know that, but just letting people know its a feature of AOSP, not CM.  









 Tell me what its like to look in the mirror and hate everything that you see. Tell me how it feels to know that for every second of happiness you are going to have an hour of suffering. What does it feel like to look around yourself, see the people that care for you, but theyre so far away. You scream and yell and cry but they cant hear you. Theyre looking, looking for you. Where did you go? What happened to the happy little boy that lived life to the fullest? Why am I so tired, tired of this world and this life? Every snide remark and ignorant comment feels like a punch to the gut. Im being eaten alive by a disease whose first mission is to knock out your communications. You cant tell anyone about the dark cocoon youre wrapped in. Wave after wave it crashes down on you, youre drowning, gasping for air. In between the waves you might be lucky enough to see a bit of sunshine, but only for an instant before your sight is robbed from you once more. What is a life without true happiness? Where the best feeling is no feeling at all, and sleep is the only real escape? Can a person really be blamed for wanting to escape such a hopeless place? What is living if it is simply out of guilt for the pain you would cause loved ones? If only I had gotten help sooner. 
 




 Not sure how to start these things. I'm 16 years old and I was diagnosed with depression about eight months ago, but the effects of depression and suicidal thinking I've been experiencing for much longer, I'd say about 2 and a half years. 

I've had suicide "attempts" but I view these only as testing the waters, seeing just how close I can get to death before I back out. The most recent one was the most frightening. When I do this stuff to myself an intense clarity comes over me. It is quite literally a calm before the storm: everything is crystal clear and in those moments I swear I knew the answers to the universe. I was ready to die that night, but again I backed out. Each time I get ever closer. 

Right now I'm the happiest I've been in a long time; just gotten out of hospital and I'm on new medication, making huge strides in therapy. Yet I cannot shake this feeling of utter dread. This feeling of knowledge - the simple plain fact that my time is limited and when I die, it will be by my own hand. I am my own worst enemy. It feels like trying to hold up the sky - I can fight as hard as I can but eventually, the time will come when I break and the sky crushes me. I am loved. I can see it, feel it and experience the joy that it brings. But it feels worthless. I am unable to dredge up any meaning from life. I know I should try harder in school, but I just don't - I don't see the point in it. I want to make it clear that I am very happy, content with my life how it is at the moment. But similarly to how a terminal cancer patient is enjoying their last days, I enjoy my last days with those that I love. I know that people will be hurt - my family, friends, girlfriend will be absolutely crushed. But I feel like its not up for me to decide - the darkness within me is too powerful. It is relentless and I am its prisoner.  









 My plan allows me to use unlimited Facebook with 200mb of data/month for everything else. I'm currently using Onavo Count to manage my data usage but it's inaccurate as Facebook usage isn't metered by my carrier. Does anyone know of any data-watching apps that would allow me to add an exception to any connections going to facebook.com? 



















 depression is

turning your phone off because you think nobody will try to text or call you anyway

having to deactivate your facebook so you arent tempted to impulsively post depressing and attention seeking statuses

being paranoid to the point where you ruin your friendships with people before they have the chance to hurt you

walking into your room and collapsing onto the floor and into tears as soon as youre out of everyones sight

having to say what? all the time because you cant seem to focus on what anyone is saying

looking at your school books and being unable to read or write anything because you just cant seem to think at all

getting angry at people when they touch you

not being hungry or feeling sick when you try to eat

the feeling of a constant weight on your shoulders

always being tired, no matter how much sleep you get

staying up all night because you dont want the next day to come

lying to your friends, psychologist and parents, telling them that youre getting better because you dont want to stress or worry them anymore

feeling like youd be better off dead

seeing the worst in people at all times

being unable to take a compliment or accept anything nice towards you

testing people to see if they actually care about you

overthinking things to the point where a kind gesture can become a hateful insult

spilling your whole story to people again and again in the hopes that maybe someone will save you

not being able to take a joke

having to fake a smile all day

hurting the people that you care about the most

asking yourself why cant you just be happy? on a daily basis

being constantly judged by people who have no clue what youre going through 



















 16, depression for 2+ years. something tipped me over tonight, tried to hang myself in my closet but clothes rack/metal bar thing broke from my weight... i blacked out for a few seconds and woke up on the floor. i don't know what to do. i'm such a fuck up, i can't even get suicide right. 




 My Facebook app refuses to load the newsfeed or anything for that matter. Instead of posts it just says "no content" in the newsfeed, and trying to load any other page just throws me an error "no content" or "connection timed out".

I can connect to the mobile site fine and everything works.

Rocking a Galaxy Gio, running CM7.2 (as seen in my flair), done all the usual things, rebooted, logging in and out, cleared data/caches of the app, uninstalling and reinstalling and I'm still at the same place. Anyone had this problem before? 




 Why? Just why? I hate myself. It's like I'm just too used to being depressed and sometimes it just feels more... comfortable. Like being happy and normal is an effort for me. I don't want to feel like that. Why does happiness come so easily to everyone else? Why do I have to try? Why do I have to lean on this stupid green pill like a crutch? What happens if I just stop taking it every morning? Do I just go back? All the "progress" I've made, does it just disappear? I'm so angry and frustrated because I can see myself hurting people that are important to me. I just want someone to understand. I hate this. I want to be better. 














 Would like a few people to squad up with on the weekends. c: 














 I know there's plenty of guides in the sidebar but the thing that I find myself having most trouble with is simply the vocabulary and lingo that is used in this game - I'm trying to read guides and posts on reddit and I end up coming away more confused than I already was! If someone could point me in the right direction, that would be great, because I've totally enjoyed the few games that I've played. 
























 I know that there is already a reddit group on flickr, but would anyone be interested if I decided to create a flickr group purely for people to post their photos for the assignments into?

Edit: Due to all the positive feedback, I went ahead and created [reddit photoclass2012a](http://www.flickr.com/groups/1828866@N24/) on flickr. :) 





























 There's an online sketching/drawing site, based on Flash I think. When you draw it automatically draws lines in between your lines, sort of like a spider web. It's hard to describe.  












































 Hey there /r/photography. I've got a bit of a problem with my camera.

I recently bought a second-hand Canon 300D (the first Digital Rebel) from eBay for $350. I've been using it for about a month now, no problems. The camera came with two CF cards; one 512mb and a 128mb.

When I first got the camera, I put the 512mb card into it and hadn't taken it out until last night (I don't have a CF card reader so I simply plug my camera into my laptop and transfer the images that way, so there is almost no reason for me to take the CF card out.) I was planning to take more pictures than usual today, as I was going out with a couple of friends and I tend to take quite a few shots when I do; so I decided to make sure the 128mb card worked, since I'd never tried it before.

This is where the problems started. I replaced the 512mb card with the 128mb card and turned the camera on. When I do this, it takes much longer to turn on then usual ("EOS" is displayed on the screen for about fifteen seconds, as opposed to the normal one or two before I can start taking pictures). The screen then starts flashing with an "Error 02". 

I googled around a bit, and apparently Error 02 has something to do with the card and not the camera, and it suggests to format the card and try again. I tried to format the card on the camera, but the error wouldn't let me access the menu to do so. I simply wrote off the card, deciding that I'd pick up a 1GB card from an electronics store as soon as I could to use instead.

No problems, the 512mb card had done me good so far. I'd just have to be scarce with my picture taking.

So then I go to swap the 512mb card back in. The camera turns on as normal but the CF reading LED (which usually flashes for about ~1 second before I can save pictures to the card) only flashes once, and then I get a message on the screen saying "Full CF". Which is weird because I know for a fact that it's not. So I went into the menu, and tried to format the card. Before I format the card, it gives me information on the space - "2.7mb used of 3.8mb" - which obviously can't be right because it's a 512mb card.

So I go ahead and press format and then I get an "Error 99" on the screen. A google search of the error brings up mostly results about cleaning the lens connection on something similar; which I know is not the problem because the shutter works just fine when there isn't a CF card in there.

So has anyone experienced this before or know of a place I can take the camera? I'm not sure where I'd go to get it fixed, given that it's quite old. 




 Hey there, /r/Android. I just recently got my first Android phone (yay!) but I've been a long time android researcher and /r/Android lurker.

Anyway, I'm looking for an app that makes the backlights for the touch sensitive buttons on the Galaxy Gio flash or pulsate when I have a missed call/unread message/other notification - basically emulating a notification LED. Does such an app exist? 


































 Australia has had metered internet usage ever since I can remember (I'm only young, so that doesn't really mean much - but we've had capped usage for *at least* five or six years). I fail to see why it's such an issue in Canada - if your cap doesn't have as much data as you would like, then doesn't it just make sense to upgrade your broadband plan? Or am I missing something important here? 




 I just bought this phone online, and I can't seem to find **any** custom ROMs for the Backflip - my Google-Fu must be weak tonight.

The reason I want a custom ROM is because - frankly, Motorola's custom UI **sucks**.

*"If you knew you didn't like MotoBlur, then why did you buy the Backflip in the first place?"* - It's currently the only Android phone available to me through the carrier I want   the price I am willing to pay. Besides, I know I can just install LauncherPro and be done with BlurHome, which is my prime concern anyway.
