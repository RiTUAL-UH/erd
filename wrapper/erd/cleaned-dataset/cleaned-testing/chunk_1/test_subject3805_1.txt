 I've never really thought about that, but that's very possible. I will try bringing it up to them, hopefully they take me seriously  




 That a good idea, I just want to go see someone I trust. I'm trying to work up the courage to, last night I had a horrible night and I hope she will take me seriously 




 Internet hugs to you too, I'm glad someone's on my side! 




 Thank you for the advice, good luck to you too. I tried talking to the school counselor once after my mom and I had this big fight over nothing (she threatened to leave the family) and that was around the time I started getting overworked about things. She was okay to talk to, but its hard for me to open up to people and I couldn't find the strength to to her. I hope you find help too!  




 Thanks, I will try that!
