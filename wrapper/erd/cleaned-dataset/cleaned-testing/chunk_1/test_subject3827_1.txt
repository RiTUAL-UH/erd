 The Ricky Gervais Show 




 *Hello,* Nedry 




 I sorta felt that Rise was both Escape and Conquest, while Dawn was more Conquest/Battle - either this will just be Battle, or Battle/Apes 




 I hope they change it to War *on* the Planet of the Apes, I think that sounds better 









 Too bad for you man 




 Seriously, that stuff is incredible 




 Well, thankfully it wasn't Hank Azaria or one of the main family members - I don't think they'd be able to go on without them 




 Huh 




  uses his God powers to send these legitimate practical effects to his son and our savior, Jorge Millir 




 Disney knows what they're doing 




 I Love Lucy 




 It's like poetry, it rhymes.

FTFY 




 Scrambled 




 They're kinda cute, actually. 




 If you could give birth to an animal, what would it be? 




 Okaya I wonta 




 Well, it didn't take me that long to make - I'll try to clean it up a little - add music, make the cuts a little less rough - what else? 




 Empire Strikes Back, Godfather Part II, LotR: Return of the King, The Dark Knight 




 What, the 5 minutes it took me to make? 




 So it's okay to put a written version of this plot leak, but not a visual? 




 Oh shoot! 57 seconds of your precious life down the drain!

Oh, and no one forced you to watch it. 




 Soylent Green... IS PEOPLE! 




 Nah, it's the same thing has having a nose in the middle of your face - it's right there, and it seems like it would be a distraction, but you don't really notice it. 




 Yeah, I can't believe they gave him those 3 Oscars! Ugh, how stupid of those "academy members" to reward good filmmaking! 




 Throw up your hands and raise your voice! 




 The ring came off my pudding can! 




 Well, sorta Jar Jar for giving Palpatine his power  




 Ricky Gervais' stand up is pretty hilarious  




 Yeah, but the question wasn't "which fact do you not believe is true?" 




 That's not only not socially acceptable, but insane. I hope you were joking. 




 That's where, we found... 




 Any way the wind blows, 




 My favorite
 




 Doubt it 




 The Man Who Knew Too Much 




 Yup, because the only people who see these billion dollar movies are mouth breathing fanboys. 




  Bash your brains in

FTFY 




 Oh gawd this bothers me so much.

It's "*Wendy.* *Darling.* Light. Of my. Life."

Sorry 









 Then post it in /r/musicvideos or something. 




 So May 1994?

 Really? I've never heard of this vastly underrated film! 




 Right, but they are 2 completely different mediums. Paintings can use visual storytelling, doesn't mean it's something you discuss in a movie-focused setting. 




 I can't wait till they release a new LEGO Star Wars game with TFA included 




 Why is this being asked in /r/movies? 




 Really? And all the other fake plot rumors and trailer "leaks" aren't? At least I'm reporting on a piece of news that's actually true... 




 Who was making that point? 




 Ugh, I guess I have to:

Le *Interstellar* 




 You can't try a food for the first time and not like it, and then have someone explain why they like it and it changes your opinion.

I totally agree. 




 C'mon, it's not *that* expensive  




 No, it's just the article with the same pics 




 Yuuuuppp 




 Well, everything about this looks more promising than the prequels... 




 No - I just meant I have it digitally - i don't have early access or anything. Besides, im sure it'll be online Monday. 




 In the Apple newsstand store 




 I meant out digitally - it's not like I have exclusive access to it or something... 




 Yeah, it was sorta obvious.

Just tryin' to be a good person. 




 Actually, Empire Strikes Back is the Pig in the City of Star Wars movies 









 Alright, but you're the one who couldn't understand a simple joke. I really couldn't care less. 




 Seriously, I'm confused now. I'd love to help you explain it, but now I'm not even sure what you're referring to. 




 Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan 




 Less than 5 years ago, this was just a dream. And now it's actually happening. I can't believe it.

I hope it doesn't suck! (It won't) 




 I'm glad they're taking the starting-over route, and the ending leaves a lot of possibilities as well.

Thoughts? 









 I was having this debate with a friend the other day, and he said that a movie doesn't need to have a central lesson or message to take away from it to be good.

I disagreed, and I still think it's one of the most important parts of film.

What do you think? What (well-liked) movies don't have this, but are still good? 




 Lord Nolan also appreciates the Kevin James directed psychosomatic-thriller.









ayy lmao 




 Now don't get me wrong. The Dark Knight is not, by any means, a bad movie. It is well acted, well directed, and very well put together. But as a superhero movie, and as a movie in general, it falls down in a few places.

1 We don't get emotionally involved with our characters. In movies like Superman or Spider-Man, our characters show that they are humans, and they have struggles. Superman literally moves the world back in time to save the person he loves. Spider-Man never knows whether he should reveal his true self to his friends and enemies. Batman just says he's the good guy. He doesn't show it, and you probably wouldn't care if he died.

2 Why so much violence? Seriously, why does every car or building need to get shot at or blown up? It should be a battle between the hero and the villain, not the hero and the villain and the rest of the world. It doesn't need to happen, and it shouldn't. Maybe a few times, but it shouldn't detract from the story itself.

TL,DR: - this is NOT a bad movie, but there are much better superhero films

EDIT: or a 94% on RT, the ideas still apply 




 Sometime before or after the release of The Godfather Part III, Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola came up with a potential sequel idea. It would have been a similar style to Part II, switching back and forth from Vito's early days as Don in the 1930s (as well as the early years of his children's lives), and Vincent as the new Don in the 1980s. Vincent takes a turn from his predecessors, and gets the Corleone family involved with narcotics again. It would have ended with his death. 

More info can be found [here](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Corleone), under "abandoned sequel"

Do you think this could've worked? 









 I have a friend who literally cannot watch movies made before the year 2000. 

Some examples:

Thought that Star Wars was "too slow," Back to the Future is "cheesy" and Hitchcock is boring.

I need a 20th century movie that quickly gets into the plot, looks good, has a good pace, and good acting. His favorite movies are The Social Network and Nightcrawler.

I hope someone can help! 




 My reaction after seeing it again:

Good stuff:
- Thoroughly enjoyable
- Not lazily made or incompetently made
- Basically a dino horror movie

Bad stuff:
- Sort of a stereotypical plot
- Kind of the same movie as 1 and 2 
























 I feel like Stanley Kubrick and George Orwell's novels were perfect for each other. Animal Farm and 1984 have similar concepts and themes as A Clockwork Orange, 2001, and Dr. Strangelove.

What do you guys think? 



















 Either unprotected or with a space suit -

How would it be different than on Earth? 




 Best letter ayy lmao amirite???

 




 It's called 2001: A Space Odyssey 




 Mine are:

5) Dr. No

4) Casino Royale

tied with

3) Goldeneye

2) Skyfall

1) Goldfinger 




 If one were to make a re edited version of Return of the Jedi, what would the basic plot look like? What would needed to be changed/taken out? 




 An idea I had for the highest grossing movie of all time:

Director: Christopher Nolan 

Producer: James Cameron

Writers: Joss Whedon +                      
              Quentin Tarantino

Starring: Leonardo Di Caprio, Christian 
               Bale, Jennifer Lawrence, 
               Scarlett Johansson

Music: Hans Zimmer

Cinematography: Emmanuel Lubezki

Visual Effects: Weta Digital


What would you pick? Anything to add or change? 

EDIT: Spielberg as co director, also with Chris Pratt

EDIT 2: The plot is a cross between Interstellar, Inception, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Obviously. 




 I also thought John Wick and CHAPPiE were amaze

Cinnamontography A+++ 




 Mine are:

Star Wars
Jaws
Jurassic Park
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Planet of the Apes
Back to the Future
Rope
Singin in the Rain
All the President's Men
12 Angry Men 









 Ex:

Half Life 3 speed run record, set on May 27th 3476 









 IMO they're all great. 









 I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but which movie was the one where Rocky said "every champion was once a contender who refused to give up?" 




 Like, he wanted to prove to everyone that he could make a movie on his own and it was really just a foreshadowing of what the prequels would bring... 
























 Super Smash Brothers Drift (Kart Racing/Fighting game)

You would be able to play as all the characters from the most recent SSB game, with their own customizable racing karts.

The style of the game would be somewhat different than other racers like Mario Kart - you can choose to compete with 4 - 12 players on a variety of tracks. 

But here's the twist - there's no finish line - you are continually moving around the chosen track. The position of the players is determined by a damage meter/percentage, like that of the real SSB games. You can use a multitude of attacks on other players, including bumping into other karts, and launching projectiles. Items and power ups would be scattered around the track, and whomever has the least damage when the time limit is up wins the game.

This is just an idea I had and I would love to here your opinions. I'm working on some concept art for the game, which I'll post later. 









 On the Club Nintendo website it says that new rewards are coming January 19th. 

2 things:

When today will we be getting new rewards?

What rewards do you think they'll be?

Personally, I have a lot of points to spend, so I'm hoping for some good 3DS downloads... 




 Only 11 months from today!

When do you think we'll see a poster? 









 This is kind of a stupid theory, but I'll share it anyway:

As we all know, Nintendo's first few consoles were the NES, SNES, N64, and the Gamecube. Then, we had the Wii, followed by the Wii U. 

See any similarities yet? Well, it's a bit of a stretch, but both the NES and the Wii were succeeded by consoles that had the same name, with an extra letter added. This could be totally insignificant, but could the next console be the Nintendo 128 (or something along those lines) followed by the Nintendo Videosphere? Only time will tell...


TL;DR - theory about console naming
