 The Hobbit. Every one of my friends loved it growing up. Insisted I should read it before diving into the LOTR trilogy. I couldn't stand all of the singing dwarves and poems and nonsense of the like. 

Suffice it to say I've never read any of the LOTR books despite being a fantasy/sci-fi fan. I can appreciate them for what they've done for the genre as a whole, but I cannot stand them on a personal level.  




 I'm with you on this one. Dare I say I liked the movie more? 




 Nailed it.  




 I regrettably started this, put it down about 100 pages in, and never picked it up again. Me thinks I have to start fresh again.  




 I feel like this may be a Stephen King novel, if only because he uses that "dear reader" phrase from time to time. Maybe even a piece of the Dark Tower series? 




 The Hegemony Consul sat on the balcony of his ebony spaceship and played Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp Minor on an ancient but well-maintained Steinway while great, green, saurian things surged and bellowed in the swamps below.  




 And yes, that field goal was with only two seconds remaining. 









 First off, I won't even pretend I know what it's like to be deployed or serve in combat, so I'm sure this book hit you differently than it did me. But here's my story:

A company I used to work for had a book drive two days before I left for a business trip, a 14-dayer in the middle of Mexico. Minutes before a company bus was prepared to take us to the airport I noticed my kindle was dead AND I didn't bring the charger. I rushed to the boxes of books we had a drive for, promising to return them when I came back. One of those books I snagged was "A Farewell to Arms."

Now, again, I was never deployed overseas, but this was the longest amount of time I was spending away from my family and friends. The way he describes all of those points you mention - attitude, demeanor, love - hit me in a way that left me thinking about home more than I would have liked. At the same time, a week or so into my trip, I found out a good friend of mine with a one-year-old boy had just learned that he had leukemia. Had I been stateside I would've been in the hospital room that day. But unfortunately the best I could do was get a calling card and call home to chat with her. There was something about the book that related to my reality, even if it wasn't a direct correlation. I too found myself thinking, "Man, life is short - sometimes too short, and we have to really appreciate the time we have with each other." The average person doesn't need a book to find that out, but it was a stark reminder no less.

Also, and I hope I'm not spoiling it for anyone, but I really thought this would be an exception to the Hemingway format. Which is to say, I didn't think anyone would die at the end. But then bam, with three pages left he drops a bomb on the reader. Not cool Ernie. Not. Cool. 

Still, what a fantastic read that sent me through an array of emotions at the time. 

(And for those wondering, my friend's son has since been in remission for three years and seems to be on the up and up for good.) 




 Can't say I've ever had much interest in anything he's written. The only book of his I remember reading is "Velocity," which I purchased in a bookstore during a significant layover in North Carolina. Read it in one sitting on the plane, and felt like the story was all over the place and didn't have all that great an ending. 

And on a side note, I'm happy you still have 40% of your intelligence left. I wish I could say the same - for a myriad of reasons. :-) 




 Yeah, it's been a while. Probably about 15 years since I've read it, so my memory is a bit shot. Doesn't change my stance of it being one of my favorites, but I just remember talking to a friend of mine about that scene and saying, "Do you think King channeled his younger self for that role?"  




 There may have even had something to do with his window. Maybe one of the vamps was outside of it? Argh.  




 Hard to remember exactly, but I remember it was later in the book. There was something to do with a kid who wore really thick glasses, played with models and model figurines, and maybe even liked horror movies and comic books. Man, I'm going to have to take a look again later tonight.  




 To be honest, my last few visits to the library have been for book sales. I think it's a win-win though: I get a bunch of books for less than $10, and the library benefits from a few extra bucks. I don't think I've taken a book out from a library in almost a year, although I do tend to visit them from time to time for a little solitude and peace of mind.  




 Yeah, I suppose I could've gone with one of the more modern "threats." I think Castro was in my head after having just read a story about his brother requesting a return of Gitmo and all those trade embargo talks. But thanks, glad you liked! 




 Try and work Salem's Lot into your to-read list. One of my favorites.  




 Wow, you managed to read more books by him in one year than I've managed to read in my lifetime. Kudos to you. 

11/22/63 has been sitting on my shelf for a while. I'm sure I'll attack it one day.  




 Man, tough question. I'll go with my Top 3, although I still haven't read everything he has to offer.

1. Salem's Lot - My all-time favorite, without a doubt. I enjoyed every bit of the characters, including the younger, nerdy kid later in the book who made only a small cameo but somehow struck me as King writing about his former, childhood self. Maybe it helped that I read it before all of the vampire craze from about five years ago. Then again, it's so much better than anything in the past decade or so that's been centered on vampires, so it will be hard for anything in that realm, or anything else by King, to dethrone this as my #1.

2. The Stand - I read the unedited, unabridged version, if only because King prefaced it by saying, "This is the way I meant it to be before editors hacked it up" (I'm paraphrasing, of course). At nearly 1200 pages, you can really get a feel for the parts that editors cut out, because they just stand (no pun intended) alone as this one-off bits. That said, still one of my favorite books by him, and I'm fairly certain I will one day read it again. 

3. Misery - I agree with one of the earlier comments about the imagery. King also did a great job of capturing the insanity of Annie Wilkes, famously played by Kathy Bates in the film rendition (which I also enjoyed), and the desperation of his protagonist whose name escapes me at the moment. 

All in all, I've read about a dozen of his books, which is to say only 1/3 of his collection. So take my recommendations with a grain of salt.  




 Fidel Castro's hand hovered over the red button, once encased inside a plastic cover to prevent any "accidental" attacks but now wide open to all deadly possibilities at the hands of Cuba's dictator. At this rate an attack was imminent, as one lone Cuban Missle Intern searched desperately for the one thing that could alter the tides of humanity.

"I swear to fucking God, if I don't get a bag of potato chips I'm going to blow something up." 

His staff of able-bodied assistants stood idly by, beads of sweat dripping from just below the rim of their green military caps. 

"Senor," said one of the assistants, "We have sent an intern out to find you potato chips. I assure you there is no need for this."

Castro eyed up his assistant, not recalling a single name as he scanned the young man facial features.

"I'm the one in charge, I say what is needed and what is not."

The assistant took a step back to realign himself with his cohorts, lucky to be alive for even making a mere suggestion. If anything the sheer fact that Castro's trigger hand hovered over the nuclear launch button may have been the only thing that saved him from immediate death. Not that he couldn't have the same result in a few minutes if that dumb shit Pedro failed to find potato chips.

An eerie silence hung over the room, broken only by the heavy breathing of Castro as he tried with no avail to unfuck his Chi. 

"You know, I do nice things, do I not?" he asked no one in particular. "I host fiestas, I partake in breakdancing competitions, I even clothe the homeless seconds after I take everything they have. Why must I look like the bad guy?"

With each man in attendance afraid to answer, the room remained silent.

"And now, here I am, hovering my hand over a big red button that could wipe out countless villages in Russia. Or South America. Or America. I haven't even decided on a target yet."

"Sir," one man spoke up. "No one has done anything to deserve. None of those countries has done a thing to us, or you for that matter. Think of the lives lost. Think of the children."

"Children? CHILDREN?"

"Oh shit," whispered one of the assistants.

"Children are the sole reason for my being here, right now, at this given time. Have you ever tried to get a minute of sleep in a house filled to the brim with screaming children? And then, when you can't sleep, find solace in something as simple as a bag of potato chips, only to find the diablos have eaten the entire lot, down to the very last one? HAVE YOU?!"

"No senor, I have not."

Castro took a deep breath. "It's very simple," he sighed. "Potato chips for me, no bomb is dropped. Muy simple."

Off in the distance the sound of slapping feet pounding the pavement drew closer. 

"It's Pedro!" screamed one of the assistants, equal part relieved and surprised that the dumbest of the crew managed to find a bag of potato chips in the middle of Guantanamo Bay.

Castro breathed a noticeable sigh of relief and began to slide his hand away from the red nuclear button.

"Pedro is here," panted Pedro. At that moment it was obvious to all in the room that he had once again dressed himself that morning, evident by the pants on his head, shirt around his waist, socks on his hands and scuba diving flippers on his feet. 

"Give them here!" screamed Castro, as he snatched the bag out of Pedro's hands and returned to his hovering stance over the nuclear button.

"See?" he said, breaking the tension with a small laugh. "Is OK now. Huh?"

The bag of chips crinkled under his grip as he tore open the top. 

"There is nothing to be worried about. Is OK. IS OK MY FRIENDS!"

He casually reached into the bag for his first chip. Instantly the look of anger returned to his face, the redness in his cheeks matched only by the red button. Before anyone in the room could notice the error of Pedro's ways, it was already too late.

"FUCKING RUFFLES!" he screamed, tossing the bag aside and slamming both hands down on the button. 




 Could it be that I'm strange?

Sitting here alone on a couch with delusions of grandeur dancing in my head?

Wondering if, when and how my dreams can become a reality,

Desperate to know if all is futile, whilst debating the every-day struggle of mixing passion with profession.

They say when you're strange, faces come out of the rain,

But in this cloud it would appear I'm the one begging to surface from the torrential downpour.

Am I to think a civilized sense of normalcy is the be all and end all to our lives?

To pursue the discomfort of the so-called comfort seized from waking up, working eight hours, commuting home and watching primetime television?

Why must the mold be built for us?

I aim to construct my own.  




 "...through the gate!"


That's about all I remember hearing at first, as I shook off the cobwebs and gathered enough strength to bring myself to my feet. Last I remember enemy forces were lining up outside the fortress walls as I took guard in the camouflaged bunker just outside the draw bridge. Had I had it my way, I wouldn't have been there at all. At the least maybe they could've paired me off with one of the other guards. Instead, they sent me, a narcoleptic armed guard, to stand watch for any impending attacks. Not the brightest of ideas, but then again, a lack of intelligence was the reason for my kingdom finding itself in this position in the first place.


Fully aware once again, I heard the guard bellow from the tower for a second time.


"All is lost!" he screamed. "The enemy is through the gate!"


Perhaps the enemy forces marched right past me, assuming I was dead. After all, not many people possess the ability to sleep through an attack. But they're not me, Sir Serons of the Kingdom of Peels. 


All around me enemy forces were charging forth to the soundtrack of clanking armors, barreling hooves and cheers of valor. I prayed they didn't see me peeping through the smallest of gaps in the bunker, had they even noticed it in the first place. 


What was I to do? Fighting was futile. Running just the same. Even the choice to rejoin my comrades would require a 
sprint to and through the gate, which at this point was entirely populated by the enemy. 


Still hazy from my unprovoked nap, I rested my back against the bunker wall. There wasn't much I could do. As one of the guards had confirmed already, all was lost. Nothing more to do but wait until the cover of darkness in an effort to make my mistake. 


Until then I'll just sit here, rest my head against the bunker and sl... 




 "OK, let's head up to the counter then."

"One second," he said. "I want to ask it a question." 

"OK kiddo. Go for it."

"Will Mommy buy this for me?" He shook the eight ball, flashing a huge grin across his face.

"You don't need a Magic 8 Ball to answer that one, Andy. Come on, let's pay for that and head home."

Unable to contain his excitement, Andy asked if I could take the toy out of the box for him so he could play with it on the way home. Sure, I thought. Why not? We could have a little fun with it. 

"Will I win a hundred dollars?" he asked.

"Maybe" replied the 8 Ball.

"Will Mommy win a hundred dollars?"

"Very doubtful," the 8 Ball said. We both got a good laugh at that one, after I read the word out to him, of course.

"Here, you try," Andy said, handing over the toy.

"OK. What to ask, what to ask. Will I get a new job?" 

"He never loved you."

I nearly choked on a lump in my throat. 

"What does it say Mommy?" Andy asked.

"Nothing. It says...nothing."

"You're lying!" he laughed. "Tell me!"

I couldnt believe what Id read. I even blinked a few extra times to make sure Id seen what was sitting right there in my own two hands.

"It says yes," I lied. 

"Ask another!" Andy insisted.

Suffice it to say, I didn't believe what I had just seen. "Impossible," I thought. "No way." Clearly even my mind was functioning with Magic 8 Ball-like responses to what I had just read from the toy.

"No, it's your turn," I said, offering to hand it back. But Andy insisted that since it said yes, I had to ask another question.

I stared blankly at the toy, almost afraid to ask again. 

"Come on Mom!" Andy said. "Ask it."

"OK!" I yelled, a bit harsher than I had planned. The fun of our banter had suddenly slipped away.

"Will...I...get a new car?"

"He's still with her" it replied.

By now tears had swelled in my eyes. The temptation to throw the toy was greater than ever, but my maternal instincts knew I couldn't show that side in front of my son. Especially since I couldn't even fathom the trauma he would have if I broke the first toy he'd ever purchased with his allowance money. I could see it now - on dates in high school or college, telling his girlfriend about the time his mom smashed his first toy. The therapy. The psychological trauma. The scars that wouldn't heal.

OK, I was getting a little carried away. I took a deep breath, slowed my breathing, and handed the toy back over to Andy.

"Why don't we put it away for a little while?" I suggested. "We can play more when we get home."

Slightly dejected, if not even a bit scared since I raised my voice, Andy was quick to do just that. 

"OK, Mom," he said. He looked like he was on the brink of tears.

How could a toy know? How could anyone even know? I hadn't seen him in years, ever since he stormed out the front door and left me seven months pregnant. "It's better this way," he yelled. "I won't hurt you any more."

Later that night I put Andy to bed and sat on the couch, racking my brain for answers and obsessing over a little eight dollar piece of plastic. Consider it a face off, if you will: me, sitting on the couch, picking at my cuticles (a nervous habit I cant kick), staring across at the Magic 8 Ball resting on my coffee table. Cue the cheesy spaghetti Western music. 

I wanted to, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. 

But, what if I asked it a question about...him? What if I faced the question head on? Clearly there was something wrong with this toy. All night long I'd looked over Andy's shoulder as he played with it, and through it all not a single answer came up that you wouldn't expect from the toy. "Ask Again Later," it would say. "Signs Point to Yes."

What if?

I drained the last sip of wine from my glass and reached for the toy, making sure to keep it in hand with the answer facing down. 

"OK," I said, taking a deep breathe. "Here we go."

"Will I ever fall in love again?" I asked, shaking the toy. I held my breath and flipped it over.

"Yes," it replied.

Wonderful, I thought. A standard response.

Again.

"Will I ever marry again?"

Outlook good."

Had I imagined those earlier responses? Was I suffering from heat stroke? Food poisoning? Anything?

"Will I win a hundred dollars?" What the heck, right?

"Reply Hazy, Try Again."

I tossed the toy back onto the table, equal parts disappointed and relieved. Maybe it was in my head. Maybe it was all just my imagination playing tricks on me. Whatever the case, it didn't change one thing: He was still out there, perhaps still in love with her, and I was on my couch with Andy sound asleep in the other room, knowing without a doubt that I was loved by a seven-year-old just as much as I loved him.

Some fortunes are hard to predict. 




 I've always made it a point to not spoil my kid. I never wanted to be the parent standing over my bratty child in the toy aisle seconds after he fell to the ground in a fit of hysteria begging for a toy. I operated under the simple assumption that if he sees a toy he'll want it, and if he wants it I'm not going to get it for him. It's not that I'm a jerk about it, but my parents instilled responsibility in me at an early age. I'm going to do the same with Andy, even if I have to operate under the tough love umbrella.

Truthfully, there's nothing worse than an entire room full of sad, past-their-prime toys. Maybe it doesn't resonate with a child, as they just as easily toss aside an "old" toy for a "new" one (loose terms, of course, considering "old" can be measured in sheer minutes). From where I come from, it's almost like I can see him growing too old right before my own eyes. Suddenly that monster truck he was so excited to open on Christmas morning two years ago is pushed to the corner under a pile of former, short-term toy affairs. The slinky, for example, that entertained him for about 20 seconds before he realized it didn't power up, turn on or propel itself across the room. Or the Furby, who so boldly stated that he loved him, seconds before his bulbous, glazed-over eyes closed for good behind the powerless batteries that were never replaced. A merciful death for something that irritated me beyond comprehension.

Andy's only seven year old, but that's just about the right time for him to start taking on some small chores around the house. Just last month I sat him down and told him what I had in mind. He didnt contest it, much to my surprise. His only response was, So if I clean things, youll pay me? Chalk it up as disbelief.

I started small at first. Clean up your room, make your bed, put the toys away after you're done playing with them - all small tasks that really begin to build a foundation for a work ethic that will ultimately carry him from one job to the next. Last night I asked Andy to take out the trash which, I must admit, was just about as comical as I thought it would be. For his sake, the walk down the driveway isn't a long one. And one day, if he inherits his father's genes, he'll be well over six feet. But as of right now, his small body can barely muster up the strength and dexterity needed to wheel the trash down to the curb. He tried and tried and likely wouldve kept trying had I not taken pity on him after witnessing his struggles through the front window, looking out over the driveway. Perhaps I was a bit overzealous. I may have to wait another few months after all. There's still plenty of time for him to grow up, and I'm in no rush to see it. 

Nevertheless, he showed a real interest in helping out, even if it does mean I peel off a few - very few - shekels in exchange for his services. 

When Andy asked if he could go to the toy store, I thought nothing of it. Of course, I thought. Let him reap the rewards of his efforts. 

So, down to the toy store we went, hand in hand, as I started to prepare myself for the possibility of Andy picking out a toy that was not in his ten dollar budget (eight dollars from chores, two dollars from the tooth fairy). How would he react? Could I resist the temptation of covering the difference if he chose an item out of his price range?

Rocky's Toys is a little shop in the center town, your typical "shop local" joint with its slightly higher prices and collection of toys that haven't moved off the shelves in decades. The novelty items are cute and all, but when was the last time you've seen a kid playing with a ball on a string? Or a yo-yo, for that matter? It's one of those stores that leaves you wondering how the owner barely covers rent, let alone earns a living.

Still, it's the closest toy store to home and the idea of taking Andy for a little walk narrowed down the options quickly.

"So, what are you going to get with your allowance money?" I asked.

"I don't know," Andy replied, a quizzical glance coming over his face. "I guess I'll just have to see."

"The weather's been nice lately. Maybe you can get a frisbee or a football or something that you can use outside."

"Maybe," he said. "Maybe I'll get LEGOs."

Red flag. For those who don't know, and by that I mean for those who don't have to do holiday shopping for kids, LEGOs may be quite possibly the single most expensive collection of plastic pieces I've ever come across in my life. I applaud the building and creative elements behind it, but the marketing ploy is simply demonic. Where else can a company recycle a bunch of old plastic bottles, mold them into shapes, slap a Batman logo on it and top it off with a sticker reading "$50" before they fly off the shelf? Maybe some kids' parents have that kind of money to spend, but as a single 
mother on a limited budget, I certainly do not. 

"Let's just take a look around," I said, hopefully steering him away from his idea. "You may find something you never thought you'd want."

We stepped in through the front door of Rocky's Toys, complete with the small-store jingling bell to signal our entrance. We were greeted shortly after by the owner himself, a small, aging old man who was hunched so far over his hands practically dangled at his shins. For some reason he'd always reminded me of Geppetto from Pinocchio, and even that stemmed from the days when I was a kid shopping in his store. Even then he was no worse for wear.

"Good morning, good morning," he said. It was common place for Gep...I mean, Rocky, to repeat himself from time to time. It was as if one response was for the customer, and the other was for him. 

Either that, or maybe his shop had an echo.

"Hello Rocky. Great to see you again."

"Great to see you too. Always good to see you. Always good." He barely looked up enough to make eye contact, but I took no offense to it. He hadn't been in tip-top shape for years. I didn't expect him to start doing backflips right then and there.

"What brings you in today? Birthday?"

Andy stepped right up to the plate, never too shy to talk to a friend. "No sir. I'm here to spend my allowance money." He proudly showed off his fist-full of singles, which he briskly withdrew from his pocket. In the fit of excitement he even dropped one, but was quick to snatch it up with his free hand.

"Ohhhh, I see," Rocky cried. "Well this is a big day for you. A very big day for you. Well, go ahead and look around. What's mine is yours.

Andy took off down the first aisle, past the dolls and dollhouses accessories, toward the back where Rocky kept his GI Joes and plastic soldiers.  

Despite not knowing what he wanted, Andy seemed dead set on going to his favorite section right away. Yet nothing seemed to really pique his interest right off the bat, and he quickly shifted toward the aisle where Rocky kept his puzzles, rubiks cubes, and things of that nature. 

Thankfully, all of those items would fall under Andy's budget. Unfortunately, I didn't expect him to come up with any of those in his hand. 

Andy's eyes darted from left to right, hunting for the perfect toy. Much to my surprise I saw him grab the occasional toy, glance at the price tag, and then move on. He was learning quickly, even if he was still learning his basic math.

As many parents know, take your eyes off your child for one second and anything can happen. Sure enough, as I glanced around the ceiling at hanging planes and UFOs, I heard Andy make his decision.

"I want THIS," he said, holding up a Magic 8 Ball. 

Truth be told, it's one of those toys you forget even exists. They're often times in large basins in the center of the big-box stores, collecting dust and waiting for that woman looking for a prank gift for her girlfriend, or the guy snatching up a last minute pick for his office Secret Santa. At no point does anyone ever say, "Gee, I'm struggling with this presentation right now. What would the Magic 8 Ball say?" Best case scenario it sits on a desk. Worst case scenario, and the most likely one, it winds up buried beneath other toys, going the way of the Furby, toy trucks and stuffed animals.

"Really?" I asked. "You want...that?"

"Yeah!" he said. "Bobby has one of these and we played with it during his birthday party. It's so funny!"

I wasn't about ready to shoot down his dreams, but I also failed to see the humor in messages that said "Maybe" or "Ask Again Later." Then again, the childhood joy in a toy like that wasn't necessarily in the answer, but in the question being asked. I could only begin to imagine what kind of questions two seven year old boys ask the 8 Ball universe.

"OK. Well, if that's what you want..."

Andy eyed up the price tag and smiled. "It's eight dollars and five," he said.

"Eight-fifty. Remember? The first number is the dollar amount, and the second number is the pennies. So, eight dollars, and then 50 pennies, or cents. Now, can you tell me how much money you'll have left after you buy it?"

"Ummmm...four?"

"Nope, you'll have one dollar and fifty cents."

"Awesome!" he exclaimed, clearly thrilled with the idea of earning and toy and keeping some money stashed away.

Rocky seemed enthused by the conversation between Andy and I. I couldnt help but wonder if he started remembering all of the previous kids who came into his store buying Magic 8 Balls. The questions they asked. The thrill in their eyes. The hard-earned allowance money poorly spent. 




 "Hey Mom? Yeah it's me. Yeah, I made it. OK. See you soon."
