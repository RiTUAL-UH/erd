 I have heard good and bad things about the two and I would like to know which game would be the zombie survival game, and I have played Arma 2 at a friends house; without DayZ and i didn't really like the war campaigns so that would not be a very big bonus for me. I have enough money for both but I don't think there is reasoning to by the 2 when the are relatively similar.

 I usually wouldn't  read a long post because i'm a lazy ass hole , but I read it because you put sucks butt in the title, but i totally HATE zero's class mods i have a commando and a sniper and axton's mods are well balanced and awesome and rarely subtract anything but zero's class mods are shit either your a tooth pick with a one shot kill gun or your a tank with little damage!

 It can be a team effort 




 After a while it starts looking like some guy hitting a water creature with a cup 




 melee 100, strength 10, intelligence 1, charisma 1 




 *slow clap turns into entire roaring cloud*

 Awesome!

 Omg, I live 2 towns over; in St. Stephen! 




 Yeah but it woild just be nice to have the restone auto-run into a piston 









 Omg i was so confused, I'm 6 2''and my feet are 13 so I thought he was a giant with mini feet lol 




 I actually hate lots of the people on this subreddit because they are just bitchy 12 year olds 




 I don't know why but when I saw you it made me really happy 




 MAY THAT GENIUS REST IN PEACE 




 It's mostly just belief and focus, it doesn't always work for me i only go it to work twice. If you're teleporting just focus on where you want to be cover your eyes and imagine a popping sound and then you should be there 




 i just teleport or make a door that enters a different landscape 




 Um that's what rage quitting is, if I'm losing and not having any fun I'm going to leave and find another match. people only ragequit because they are not having fun.

 WHAT THE FUCK IS A REDDIT 














 I have been doing WBTB and i would wake up and not be able to fall back asleep. Then I tried WILD I slept until 3 o'clock and woke up with my alarm, no matter how hard i tried i couldn't induce sleep paralysis so I tried to go back to bed it was about 3 hours until I finally fell asleep, And after I fell asleep, I had my first lucid dream. but it didn't feel real it felt like i was playing a video game. here is how it went down. I was walking through my house and my grand-mother came up to me and said "apple pie" I noticed that didn't make any sense and looked at my hands, I had 12 fingers, so i bit one and there was no pain just numbness. I jumped up and started to fly. I broke through a wall and into my back yard, I created a house to do "stuff" inside. (I will spare you the details.) but i lost the dream and kind of woke up but drifted back into the dream and tried to bring in a famous person (wink wink) but no luck I couldn't get any thing to join my dream world not cake, nor a gun, nor a skateboard. i started losing the dream again and decided to experience what it was like to wake up (the time before I didn't pay attention I was too focused on trying not to slip out of the dream) so every thing look like i slowly closed my eyes and i woke up and had some breakfast.

TL;DR- I need some other methods can i have a good description of one that preferably doesn't involve waking up at the middle of the night?
 
























 I like this method because it usually only takes a quick glance. Just when ever you do your reality checks look for the rim of your glasses. Due to the fact that you do not always wear your glasses if they are not there do a different reality check.
