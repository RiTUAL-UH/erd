 I have study hall and I have nothing to play. 




 How'd you, Rob, and Charlie meet? How close are you guys? 




 I mean I think they would play really similar. It's not like they would have to change the whole way he played. But after they sorted out all the copyright issues then I think it would work. I don't expect it to happen I just think it would be cool and really fun. 




 I think this would be so cool being a huge god of war fan. I think it wouldn't be too difficult since they both have the same kind of weapons, just change the look. I don't know what others would think.  Just an idea.  




 Alright man I'll take into consideration what you said and I'll definitely apply it next time I play. Thanks a lot dude 




 This is awesome. Thanks dude and what do you think is the better matchup for Marth and Squirtle? R.O.B. or Sonic? 




 I main R.O.B. and Sonic and I need to figure out how to beat my friends mains. (Squirtle/Marth) 




 Self confidence man, self confidence  




 Haha what was her reaction? 




 Just curious to hear these. 




 My parents are divorced and are still friends, my mom recently started dating a black man (my family is all whites), my dad was over looking for a key to a car. Keep in mind my dad has NEVER made a vulgar joke around me. While talking about the key to the car she says,
"Yeah, it's big and black."

and so my dad says,

"Yeah, that's two things that are big and black." You can clearly see how butthurt my mom is.

Five minutes later he comes up to me and says "Daddy's clever, right?" and high fived me. I've never laughed so hard.  




 Dad: "Oh did you hear about that celebrity that stabbed her husband? It was Reese something..."

Me: "Witherspoon?"

Dad: "No, with her knife."
