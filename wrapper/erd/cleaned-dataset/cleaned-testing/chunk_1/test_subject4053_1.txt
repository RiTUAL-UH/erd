 When I was a kid, My family (consisting of my mom, dad, twin sister and myself at the time) lived in the country and so we lived in a couple of old farm houses over the course of about 18 years. 

The last house we lived in sticks with me though. Not only was there a ghost dog in it (you could hear the sound of a dogs claws clicking on the hardwood floor and the sound of a dogs tail hitting the corner of the doorways as it wagged it's tail) But there were lots of rumors floating around about the woods we lived around. 

As you can imagine, being the only two kids, my twin sister and I were little Hellions.(the oldest of our two younger brothers wasn't born until we were 4. 

Anyway, so because we lived in the country, we were pretty much allowed to do whatever we wanted, so long as we took our whistles (this was back before cellphones were a thing) and so long as we were back before dark. 

Fast forward to being about 10 years old, My sister and I had some friends over for the weekend, my sisters friend Jade and her brother Andy and a girl called Silvette.  Being 10 (and it also being close to Halloween at the time) we all decided it would be a good idea to walk around the woods just as sunset was coming. Y'know, freak ourselves out every time we heard an owl or heard a fox bark. Silvette was a total city girl, so it was a lot of fun to freak her out (my dad and her dad worked together and her parents and my parents would get together to hang out)

Anyhoo, I remember us walking through the woods, we'd gone pretty far, when all of a sudden, Silvette says "Hey guys, let's go check out that spooky old house" 

I think all of the rest of us said "What house?". 

You see, we'd found ourselves on the treeline of this field that was behind our property. Silvette points ahead and goes, pretty persistantly "THAT house"

The rest of us look (I remember this beyond anything to this day) there was no house. 

Silvette gets mad, thinking we're picking on the city girl again and storms back into the woods towards out house. So to keep her from getting lost, we follow her back. 

Later on that week, my sister and I went back through the woods to the field we'd found, and there was indeed a house, but it had been burned to the ground at some point and was just a pile of ash and broken glass.  




 The old farmhouse I lived in as a child had a ghost dog in it, It was several years before we actually got a dog and occasionally, you could hear the sound of a dogs claws clicking on the hardwood floor in the hallway upstairs. Every once in a while, you could also hear a slight thumping sound (which as I found out after we had a living dog) sounded like a dogs tail thumping the corner of the doorway as it wags it's tail. I was pretty young, but I can still remember those moments.  




 They're just playing, that's how they learn, that's also why it's *never* a good idea to give kittens away at 5-6 weeks old. between the ages of 5-9 weeks, they learn bite inhibition, they learn how rough they can and can't be.
