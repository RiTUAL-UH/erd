 As a kid, did you ever used to close your hands over the end of a flashlight, and marvel at the way they glowed red in the dark? Maybe it was just me.

Yesterday at work, the power went out. We work in an older building, and it happens occasionally. For some reason, Gary, the guy who sits in the cubicle across the hall has two high-powered LED flashlights. I think they were the kind made for hunting. Anyway, the things are blinding.

Meanwhile, my computer is down, work has stopped, we're just waiting for them to find the fuse and reboot our tedious workday. I guess I got nostalgic, because after a while, I was putting my hands over the end of the flashlight like I did when I was a kid. Gary's flashlight was brighter than the ones I'd used before, and you could see the outlines of the bones.

There was something unusual about my left ring finger, though. The skin there glowed differently. Tiny lines stretched from my second knuckle to the third, nearest my palm. It looked like I had a tattoo.

A bar code. 




 The first creature that I saw in this place... I never saw at all. It was before I'd found a light. The only way that I knew that it was there was by the sound of its breathing, stirring the emptiness.

I was naive. Inexperience in this endless cavern told me that the rules still applied. That an empty room in the dark was still empty.

"Hello?" I called, and my voice echoed back. Still, there was something there. I could hear the faint ticking raspiness of air moving through its open mouth.

At this time, I was still standing. Foolishly, I stretched my hand toward where I'd heard the noise. My feet carried me half-heartedly. Left foot forward, then the right one coming up to join it.

It must have been close. I could hear its breath with perfect clarity now, deep and huge. I could feel the cool air against my sides, pulling me toward it; smell the scent of decay on its warm breath. Each time it inhaled, there was a whirring, ticking sound like tiny ratcheting gears being wound.

It was my nose that betrayed me. The dead-smelling exhaust tickled my nostrils and brought tears to my eyes. I sneezed, and loudly. Before the echo even made its way back to my ear, a huge metallic clang tore the silence from the air. It felt at the time as though my sneeze had broken the world.

Behemoth footballs, ringing one after the other, washed around the endless space. My ears split and popped from the noise. My hands, uncommanded, clawed into my ears, trying to pull the painful noise from them, but only managed to dull the edge a little.

Then it was gone. Wet drops poured from my ears as I lay in a pile on the smooth, cool stone. 




 My name is Jack Sweeney, and Im from the same place as you are. Set aside a few superficial differences, and I could have been you. This is important, because when I lived in your time, I did nothing to stop the events that are now happening in mine. Because I didn't know. No one did.

I could have been you, and if Id known the things that Im about to tell you, then I could have stopped it.

It started with LImBo in the U.S.; Land-based Impassable Borders. They finally had a low-cost, sustainable and highly efficient solution to controlling their border problem. With a few field emitters, the entire southern border was almost instantly walled off from Mexico and South America. A blue, impassable screen stretched two thousand feet above the surface, and as deep as they could drill below.

I've touched them. They feel cool and smooth like glass, and you can see distorted shapes of things from the other side inside it, swirling with the field.

The fields required no further energy beyond the simple setup. Three emitters to make a triangle of any size, four to make a square. Once theyd been set, it was supposed to take over a hundred years for the molecules to decay and turn back into air. This meant that the transmitters could be removed and reused infinitely.

It was the threat of war that persuaded the smaller European countries to put up their own walls. Skilled technicians were in high demand, erecting fences across the many borders. Borders were disputed, complex agreements were signed, but once the walls went up... there was nothing much more final than that. Pictures from the orbit at night showed Europe glowing blue.

A few of the smallest countries seemed to disappear completely. The only way in or out from these places was by air. The average person would never see the inside. 

There was no war. Not in the sense that theyd been expecting, anyway. The first time a border fell was between the small town of Trevechia and its larger counterpart, Yuhgo. Trevechia held about 3,000 people. Its largest attraction was an ancient church that stood in the middle of town. The border changed from cool, dark blue to fiery red. From the people of Yuhgos perspective, the little town was burned away like some kind of deathly MRI scan. It plowed a smoking trough through the middle of the country, Gerzek, toward its capital city of the same name.

In a last-ditch effort to stop the wall, a set of field-emitters and a special team were flown into Gerzek. It was, perhaps, the best team anywhere in the world. My team. Wed been prepped to respond to the escalating tensions in the region, ready to stop anything that started. Even we werent sure that it would stop this, however, and we made sure that the helicopter pilots kept the rotors spinning in case things didnt work out.

At midnight, and not a minute too soon, we initiated the field. It was thick. The thickest any of us had ever seen.

You could feel the red wall vaporizing the ground as it pressed toward us. My team was hovering above the ground with as many passengers as we could take when it found our blue border. Like molten glass, it bent, curving to match the angle, but its momentum never slowed. At the moment when it could go no further, the air crackled like it was full of electricity. Our helicopter dropped. The only lights left were the moon and the stars. When I crawled clear of the wreckage, the walls were gone.

The secret to turning the borders into weapons of mass destruction was out in a matter of days. Teams like mine, composed of only a few people could systematically destroy entire countries. Europe and Asia bore many scars.

Ten times as many LImBos went up. They were the weapon, but also the defense. Threats were made, and bombs were dropped from the sky. AImBos were engineered, and aerial warfare and travel almost totally ceased. The first time an Aerial Impassable Border was turned into a weapon, it turned Hawaii into nothing but a cloud of steam.

Then, after enough walls went up, the world fell into an uneasy peace. People went about rebuilding their lives from inside their transparent cubes.

It wasnt the U.S. that broke the peace. Not that we werent trying to think of a way. Someone small, independent and well-connected enough to get inside, found it first. Huge triangle-shaped swaths of Earth simply sank into the ground in four different countries. The walls theyd built to protect them against the outside world sealed them in instead. They were slowly consumed by the red Hell beneath their feet.

Its going to be an awful way to die. As I write this, the East Coast of the United States is sinking. Its genius, really. In a few more minutes, the ocean will drain into the void that is left. Its too late for walls.

I have to believe that if wed known, we never would have built that first Border. *I* never would have built that first Border.

You know, now. Please, stop me. 




 Staff Sergeant Donovan Berr woke up, face down in the middle of the road. Sergeant Berr had seen better days. In the past week, he'd survived a plane crash, a chemical weapons attack, fended off a family of mutant boar, and had quite possibly survived to see the end of the world.

What a week.

As Donovan lifted his head, a mix of drool, blood and quite a bit of something else entirely stuck to the side in a thick string. Heat rose from the asphalt below him and beamed down from above. Everything hurt. Donny's neck gave up and laid his head back on the blacktop, and he pinched his one usable eye tight against the sun.

The last thing he'd remembered was the smiling faces of his three companions. Other survivors of the plane crash. There had been fire, and drinks. Man, had they been drunk. Must have been. "Open bar!" one of his friends had called out to them from the unpowered glass-doored beer cooler. And it had been.

Poor Donovan heaved up a wet, chunky mixture of last night's all-you-can-eat steak and pizza.

*Wait, fire? A fire inside?*

He tried to recall the image, but the lack of a clear airway brought his thoughts back to the present. With an awesome effort, Donny managed to turn his head and exhale enough bile through his nose and throat so that he could take another breath.

*Fire. Drinks. A party? A party for what?*

"A party for what?" he'd screamed into dead, senseless eyes. "Everyone everywhere is dead, we left those two back at the fucking hangar. They're going to die! We have to get help! Don't you understand that?"

He'd shaken the person wearing a camouflage uniform until his sizeable arms had gotten tired. He wanted to hit them, to scream louder, somehow from *inside* their lolling heads, so that they'd *have* to listen. They were gone, though. Lights on, nobody's home.

A person younger than him, maybe an Airman, started pouring lighter fluid onto a childrens' clothing display. Automatic rifle slung across his back like some kind of action movie hero, he flipped the bright orange stub of his lit cigar onto the soaked, folded shirts. Pity, he didn't stand back far enough, and the lighter fluid quickly found him. 

Two of the three remaining in the dark, but not so dark anymore, Target superstore began laughing and pointing maniacally.

Donny watched in horror as the kid went up in flames.

Donny - the hot Donny, the one being fried like a griddlecake out on the street - well his stomach threatened to heave again. Since his head had turned, his non-sealed eye was in the shade of his broken nose, and he could get a little look around without bringing too much pain onto himself.

Palm trees and trimmed green grass. Hawaii. Probably fell out of the back of the truck somewhere near a golf course. God damn it, it was hot, though. Where was the fog they'd had when they'd landed? *Tried* to land, anyway.

The fog. That weird fog that hung over the whole island. Hadn't it been more than a little bit purple? Glowing, even? Not for the first time, Don wondered if maybe that had something to do with why everyone had disappeared. Not that there would be an explanation. Four guys (well, six if you counted the two they'd left at the hangar after the crash, though they might as well have been in the Alps from where poor Don was laying) weren't about to solve any kind of worldwide mystery on their own. Don couldn't even lift his own hand.

Maybe that fog could explain why the others had gone... *off* too.

Don heard a scuffle nearby, and felt a small breeze blow across his hot face.

A crazy thought occurred to him; maybe he should have gotten drunk with the guys last night. He couldn't have known that it was about to be his last day alive, but surely with everyone else gone, there was no future. Ol' Donny was just a little slower on the uptake than the others. Maybe they were the ones who'd had it right. 

*That kid with the kerosene, yeah, he had the right idea. "Go out in flames" was the saying, after all.*

Something smacked the side of D's face, sending a few red droplets down into his narrow field of vision. It felt like a hand made out of fire that grabbed something underneath the layers of missing skin and rearranged bone, and then pulled. Some... *part*, something never intended to be on the outside, gave out with a pop, and his brain registered light from his eye on that side for a split second.

More scuffles, and a flutter of large black wings.

More and more, he regretted not taking that drink. Stealing some steak and pizza and huddling into a corner of a Target Superstore, listening to his crazed coworkers singing and screaming their own made up language was hardly the way that a man should have to spend his final night.

His eye closed, then saw just out in front of him was sitting an ice cold can of beer he hadn't noticed before. He reached a hand out and took it, feeling the coolness of it in his palm. Tasting the hoppy, foamy bitterness on his lips. Now that was a way that a man should die. 




 Constructive Criticism, Please!

 Let's talk about expectations for a minute. Stereotypes. Associations.

What comes to mind when you hear the word "teacher?" What do you picture? If that's too broad, think of a "high school English teacher, male, in his late 20's." What's he wearing? What did he drive to work? What expression is on his face? 

Now, these exercises are, by nature, reductive - a person is not solely defined by his job title, age, appearance, gender, race. One man can can even have many sides, depending on who he knows is watching. They're reductive, but that doesn't mean that they don't serve a purpose. In college, there was an assignment to list 100 things about someone based on only a few details. This was so that when you wrote a character, called ["The Janitor,"](http://redd.it/2deuf4) without saying anything else about him, you would know how your audience was going to picture them.

Think back to that teacher that you pictured earlier. I'll feed you some details this time. 

This is Charlie. He's wearing the same pale blue button-up for the third day in a row, hoping no one will notice. It's the same shirt he wore to his internships, only with one fewer button, allowing his newly filled out gut to push through. He came to work in the same Volkswagen P.O.S. that he drove away from this high school after he graduated. On his face as he grades an endless pile of shitty book reports isn't an expression. The particular fuse in his brain that controlled facial expression burnt out sometime around 2 am. Now there's just red, and clear beads of fever sweat from a month of living on fast food and the Smirnoff he kept hidden in his desk.

As he scribbles "F" on one more paper, the pen fails to stream any more ink. After what's felt like eons of tireless, thankless work, the pen has given up. As it's stabbed into the desk, it collapses under the force and shatters. Clear plastic splinters lodge themselves into the flesh of his hand, the teacher's own red fluid stains the desk like sponge paints, again and again.

The only thing that stops him from tearing apart the desk, the students desks, the windows, the cheesy posters and chalkboard on the the walls, and then going to work on himself is the feeling of eyes pressing on him from the rear of the lecture hall, just out of reach of his small desk lamp. Is it the feeling of eyes, or the barely audible sound of someone breathing heavily?

In the stillness, he can hear it more clearly. It's not a whisper as scratchy as sandpaper and a snake's hiss, it's laughter, coming from a dark shape in the darkness. Staring, straining to see in the dark, he hears the breath catch and go silent.

"Hey! Who's up there?"

*Pop!*

Charlie's alcohol-depressed nervous system reacts without him, flinching away from the tight, hollow sound.

"Come out of there. You're scaring me."

"Charles?"

Something about the word, fetched from the darkness isn't right. It's too dry-sounding, like the throat that produced it was full of dust-bunnies. It's too round, like the mouth that formed it was too lazy, or lethargic from years of misuse. It's too formal, like it forgot where, or when it was.

These details rattled through Charlie's brain for a moment before being swept away by the sight of something emerging from the darkness.

Two points of light, reflections of the lamp in each lens of a pair of over-sized glasses. A man, hunched and pitted, like he's been dried in the sun. His face is covered in wrinkles like cracks, little spidery voids that expose the black void within. A set of coveralls so ancient, it looks like they're made of purely dirt and dust, swept from some unknown basement.

The further the man comes into the light, the more corpse-like he appears. Eyes are gray and flat, like newspapers.

"Charles Grant?"

Charlie remembers himself and tries to run, but stumbles over his heels, and ends up sitting hard on the desk.

For some reason, despite the toll that years of death has taken, Charlie can just recognize the janitor from when he did his time as a student. After all, it had been the janitor who had cut the lock from the locker on Monday, when he'd been stuffed there on Friday. The janitor who had pulled him down from the flag pole, and cut the duct tape from around his mouth and wrists. It was the janitor who had found Charlie unconscious in the girl's bathroom, covered in blood where a group of kids had broken his jaw and left him.

It doesn't take long before the janitor has found his voice again, and begins telling the new teacher the things he's seen. 

Terrible things. Horrible tales about the seemingly normal and happy families and people who passed through the halls of the school every day. Things that he couldn't have known - that no one could have known.

I am Charlie. Excuse me, "Mr. Grant."

This is how I met the janitor. How he came to me, in order that I might finish what he could only dream of starting.

It took some time to build the contraption. It was time well-spent, however. It's important to always use the proper tool for the job.

Sure, there were a lot more efficient options for killing... but somehow this one seemed more fitting.

Cleaner.

The setup was simple. A small compressed gas chamber, put pressure on top of a two gallon reservoir of 10% bleach in water. The pressure pushes the solution through a hose to a trigger-operated shutoff valve. And the whole thing is tipped with a 6-inch-long, lethally sharp, quarter inch gauge stainless steel needle. In less than one second, the bleach solution could be blasted into the needle at pressures above two hundred pounds per square inch.

It took some planning to get Mary S. alone. It had to be predictable and I obviously couldn't allow myself to be observed or interrupted. I followed her for a day to feel out her routine and to find an appropriate location. While I was waiting, I found my next victim.

I was parked in front of Mary's workplace in a gravel lot. Having a police cruiser pull up behind my car gave me a scare, and I thought of the difficult- (but not impossible) to-explain bleach blaster in my trunk. When I caught a glimpse of the officer's face in the mirror, it was almost a relief. 

Of course I know who he is. I know all about Officer Morgan. I know all about *everyone* here, now. It's almost encyclopedic. And the truth is, real monsters are all around us, hiding in plain sight. I could see his sins as plainly as the stains breakfast had left on his uniform.

* Accepts bribes in exchange for tips on places with low security or where the owners will be away.
* Runs protection against the law for drug traffickers doing business in town.
* Has been directly involved in the cover-up of five separate missing persons.
* Responsible for the murder and disposal of a hooker.

No, excuse me. A "lady of the night."

I'd known McKenzie, since she'd been a student at the high school. She was a good kid, but she got dealt a bad hand at home. It was her dad who forced her into the game, and her mom and all her uncles took the money to get high. Sometimes, when a kid goes through that much slime, it doesn't wipe off. Especially when the people they crawl to for help throw them right back into the shit bucket with a little bit of cash.

He had it coming now.

I watched him as he walked up the side of my car, peered through his mirrored aviators at me, and without a word, wrote me a ticket for being illegally parked. I was outraged, and got out of the car to protest. The worm didn't even acknowledge my existence. He waddled over to a red-painted wooden beam that was intended to mark part of the fire lane, dragged it through the gravel into position behind my car, and dropped it there with a hollow "thunk." What a dick.

Excuse me, what a *fucking* dick.

Later, I followed Mary to the school, where she went to pick up Kayla. Pulling into the familiar parking lot, I noticed that the generator area where I'd found the door was roped off with yellow caution tape. Suddenly, I couldn't remember whether I'd locked the door that night; I couldn't remember anything except the rush of finding the truth. Since that moment, I'd been so caught up in this that I forgot all about work. I hadn't cleaned all weekend. 

I found my reserved parking slot, but saw that there was a familiar, gray van parked there instead.

The Happy Janitor

I'd been replaced.

I guess it's official. I'm that kind of janitor anymore.

The next morning, I snuck into the back seat of her car before she left for work. Everything was in position and perfect - I practiced how I would strike, and the needle slid through the seatback like a hot knife through butter. I imagined what it would be like, her sitting down, oblivious in the pre-dawn haze of morning. She'd start up the car, back out of the driveway using only her mirrors, take a left at the end of the street, and then pull off onto the shoulder to light up a cigarette, a habit she kept from her husband and her kids.

It wasn't the only filthy thing she'd done since the sun had gone down.

Everything went perfectly. Right down to the way she'd retrieved her cigarettes and lighter before rolling down the window, so that her screams would be muffled inside the sealed car.

I pushed the needle up to the hilt and pulled the trigger, bracing myself for the kickback, the probable explosion of viscera and bodily fluids and bleach that would be forthcoming.

Instead, there was nothing.

Mary rolled down the window and lit her cigarette.

I frantically checked my rig. Everything was perfect. It wasn't possible that the needle hadn't pierced into her heart or lungs and powerfully disinfected her from the inside of her chest cavity out.

I stabbed again. Shot again. Nothing.

When that had failed, I tried to use the hose to strangle her... But she sat there, unaware and unaffected by my straining efforts to depart her from this world.

I couldn't kill her.

I can't kill *anyone.*

But I know just who deserves it. 

I see the truth of the *uncleanness* of the world around me with perfect clarity... Yet I am totally unable to do anything about it.

Is this Hell?

My first is Mary S.

Mary S. hurts her kids. She loves her son, Robbie, but she hates her daughter Kayla with some unimpeded passion. In fact, most people dislike Kayla. 

Excuse me, "hate" Kayla.

They do it in varying degrees and show it with different types and elevations of violence against her. Each of which leave their own brand of scar.

And the honest truth is, even I didn't like her... Before. I mean, she is kind of... strange. She just doesn't fit in. She's not like the others, and the differences aren't borne gracefully.

Now, there isn't anyone who doesn't have at least a few flaws. No one is qualified to *cast the first stone*, so to say. But that isn't the system that I operate by. The way I like to work is by tackling the big messes first, and wiping them away. Justice.

Pardon me. "Retribution."

And what makes *me* qualified to be the judge of whether a person is worthy of their sentence before their natural death? The truth, of course.

The truth was revealed to me as I passed through the door last night. The truth is what was in that basement. At first, I had thought to fight it. To kill it. But as I crossed the threshold, in the place where I had expected the personification of evil, I found beauty itself in all its magnificence.

I saw.

The truth is light - and it should not be feared for the things that it is cast upon. And she has cast a *great deal* of light on the people of this town.

Which brings me to my revelation about little Kayla. I can say with a conviction deeper than knowing that she is clean. She is as undeserving of her mother's hatred as her brother is of her love. A love gone too far. 

The truth that everyone else misses as they shy away, made uncomfortable by the sight of a mother who hits her daughter, is that that the same mother turns around and lusts for her own young son.

And so Mary S. became my first.

But not my last - far from my last. I suspect that this town will be a much smaller place when I have finished my work. A great many people have brought this filth here. They've managed to hide it, a festering sore, full of infection that could spread to the rest of us, spreading the filth and shit, unchecked.

And if there's one thing I hate, it's a mess.

I'm a janitor, after all.

[Not That Kind of Janitor](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2d4zgq/im_not_that_kind_of_janitor_anymore/) 




 It's not the easiest job being a janitor.

Excuse me, I'm supposed to call myself a "Custodial Engineer" now.

You might think that it's just brainless, rote work, but you end up finding yourself thinking a lot about whether you really want to do the things you're about to do.

*Why am I scraping this gum off the floor? It's just going to be there again tomorrow.*

*I just had to put that bag of garbage down because the smell was too much. Do I want to pick that up again?*

*Do I really want to scoop ten pounds of human waste out of this toilet right now?*

Getting into these kinds of dirty situations isn't natural, in the biological sense. Some strong, primal segment of your mind is telling you not to go there. Not to subject yourself to that. That it's not safe.

I found the entrance to the basement two days ago. Not *the* basement, there are separate basements under each section of the school; the gym has a storm shelter under it; the band room stores their old and broken instruments in theirs; under the lunch room, there are props and costumes for things like football games, homecoming and prom. The basement I found is under the auto shop.

It was midnight, and despite clear, starry skies, the power went out while I was mopping down the History and English hallway. To turn on the lights, I had to turn on the auxiliary power generator, located in an enclosure off of the auto shop.

Excuse me, it's a "Vocational Training Lab" now.

Anyway, I go past the auto shop, into the enclosure, turn on my flashlight and... there's a door. And for some reason I've never seen it before, or I saw it and didn't realize that it was a door. From the outside, it's just a little square with a hinge. It could be a vent, or an access panel for wiring, but this night, for whatever reason, I realize that it's a door and that the bottom half is buried in the gravel that rings the cement pad that the generator sits on. I dig a little and find a handle.

As soon as I touched the handle, I could hear voices from the other side. At first I thought there were two people arguing, but now I'm sure that it's just one. And Jesus, the things that it's said... 

About me, about the other students and teachers. About my friends and family. Things that *no one* knows. He told me which of my neighbors beat their kids. Which of my friends cheat on their spouses. He told me about the time the old Economics teacher, Mr. Parker was in high school and accidentally hit someone with his car and got away with it. About what Principal Taylor and his frat buddies did to someone's little girl...

It's been down there a long time, watching, listening. I sat and listened all night.

I haven't slept.

I can't close my eyes because if that thing with the whispering voice like a mix of sandpaper and an angry snake's hiss were there at the foot of my bed when I opened them... I'd just rather die than live that moment.

I dug away the gravel. Today, I'm going to open the door.

I got a sharp piece of metal from the auto shop, and wrapped the bottom of it like a spear. Do you think that'll work?

As a janitor, you find yourself asking yourself a lot of times if you really want to do the thing you're about to do, and I definitely don't want to go through that door, but I have to.

Because there's something in there. Something unclean.

We stayed in Ahmed's "model house" for 14 days. 

Ahmed was right; other than the plane, an attempt to escape would have gotten me killed. There's just nothing out there. Apparently the mock town they'd built to test weapons was one of a few that was never actually used, and that's the reason that it's safe to be there for any period of time. I asked Ahmed what his role in all of this was, and he couldn't give me many details. He was... quirky.

He worked for the U.S. National Parks Service. For about ten years they've had him conducting sweeps of the abandoned houses and buildings out there. It was a logical step to adopt one as a "home camp," since trips out there weren't exactly easy. I went with him on some of the sweeps, it was pretty uneventful. Most of the buildings were in bad shape. The sand had shifted and been swept by the wind up around most of them, and the hastily-constructed structures couldn't often take the weight. I never quite got used to seeing the families of mannequins huddled around the T.V. or laying on bare mattresses.

Most of the time, the only danger Ahmed found was from wild animals who had made their dens in the abandoned buildings. He had found squatters before of course. People who had driven off into the desert for who-knows-what reason. They were the reason he'd started carrying a gun. Then he met a man in a bar.

"The man wore a suit - full suit to this bar and he asks me what I do. I tell him I give tours of the parks for most of the year and sometimes I travel to the remote federally-owned lands to look for problems. This man is very interested in this, and talks to me for a long time about how technology takes our independence. I talk to him again a few times through e-mail and he asks me if I can take someone with me on one of these trips. It's not usual, but I tell him that I could do it and no one would know.

"The first person he sends, I meet them at a hotel in California. He thinks I don't know that he's watching and asking questions to see what I know. I bring him here - this is before I purchased my plane - and he tries to sabotage us. He pours out the water, sabotages the food, cuts apart his shoes. But I know how to find water. I can hunt here, I can make shoes. So after two weeks, we go back to California. Then I hear from him again. This one I meet, North in Idaho. They are blindfolded and handcuffed. They give him to me and tell me he cannot use the phone, and that he is very dangerous.

"This one I watch very closely. The first night, while he sleeps, I hide the keys and remove the battery from my van so he cannot take it. When I get back, I see him leaving, trying to head North. This way, I know, there is nothing. I pack my bag and I follow him. He is smart, and hides from the sun in the day and moves at night. So I follow him further and let him think that he is alone. The next night, he starts to go a different way. From this, I know that he does know where he's going. There is a small town that way, but it is still too far to go.

"He starts to cramp from the lack of water, and falls down. I come up behind him and he begs. Begs like a dog for water and food and for me to take him back. I don't have enough water now, and I told him not to try to run. So I shoot him, and bury him there in the desert.

"After this, every few months, I get a call for someone to bring. No more tests."

After our two weeks was up, we head back to the plane. We load up the gear and take off, but stay low. We're flying at night now. An hour away, he sets us down again on a little lighted runway where we meet a fuel truck. He really didn't take any chances.

After re-fueling, we returned to the municipal airport we'd left from in Oregon. On the ground, Ahmed seemd to be irritated about something. Someone was late, or not showing up to pick me up. He said he'd give me a ride instead, but I detected a little bit of worry sneaking into his normally reserved face.

We went to the coffee shop first, since it was closer. I was wearing fresh clothes that Ahmed had brought packed for me, but I hadn't had a shower in two weeks, and I was sure they would be able to smell me coming. If they would have been there.

All the doors were locked, and the windows were blacked out. No one was there, not even a car in the parking lot, including my own. Ahmed agreed to take me to my house so that no one would ask questions. I didn't have money or a phone or anything. He wanted answers as well, but no one was returning his calls.

I let myself in with a spare key. Everything appeared to be untouched in my house. My phone was still missing. On a hunch, I went to check my email. Amid the junk that had piled up there, there was one from Sam. It was an image of a bunch of warped text like a Captcha. It loaded instantly.

    test_subject4116,

    Hope you get this.
    They were too fast.
    They found us before we could get away with it.
    Plus, I think my New York friend turned.
    :(
    |'m sorry for everything, but at least you're safe.
    | wish I could have been here when you got back.
    Go, run away. The
    only way they won't find you is if you keep
    on the move.
    ...
    Good
    luck,
    | wish you all the best.
    Vegas is nice this time of year. I know how you used to
    Love to gamble.
    Ha. Maybe someday,
    everything will be okay and I'll see you again.
    0n the back of the monitor is your cut. I hope it helps.
    Thanks for letting us use your internet. -Sam

This is where my story ends for now. Sam if you're out there, I'm okay. Vegas was nice. So was Atlantic city. And London, Frankfurt, Tokyo and Honolulu, too.

So, when do I get to come home?

By the way, Sam, I cancelled my Dial-Up.

From the donut shop, I was carried outside. I tried to yell for help from anyone who might be outside, but I was quickly silenced as someone drove their foot hard into my stomach. I was pushed into a car, where a man with a Middle Eastern accent spoke to me from the front seat.

"I have three simple rules. You don't follow my rules, and I kill you. One, no running. You run, I shoot you in your back. Two, no communication. No phone, no internet. I don't care how you do it, I will know. And I will kill you. Three, you do exactly what I say at the moment I tell you. That's clear?"

"Yes."

I could feel myself sandwiched in between two other men in the back seat of the car. My wrists were zip-tied behind me before I got into the car, and the angle of my arms was giving me a cramp. It was hot, and getting hotter as I strained to keep the pressure off the zip-ties cutting into my wrists.

"Who are you?" I asked, but the only reply was from the rocking of the car as it sped along some unknown road.

The car came to a stop, the doors opened and the men on either side of me exited. I was being pulled out into the afternoon sun, and then I was left. I flinched, and braced myself, unsure of what was going to happen next. I heard the car accelerate and drive into the distance. The bag was taken off my head.

In front of me was the owner of the voice I'd heard. He was short and I judged that he was in his mid-fifties. He wore an old black leather jacket and gold-rimmed sunglasses. Using a black, pointed blade, he cut the zip ties from my hands.

"I am Ahmad Bari. I will be your..." he searched for the word, "*companion* in the coming weeks. Please, step on board. Be careful of your head."

At that, he motioned behind me, to a small, white airplane. We appeared to be on a runway, the town's municipal airport, I had to assume. I eyed the weapon in Ahmad's shoulder holster, before turning my back and getting on board. Once in the cockpit, Ahmad handed me a large headset and began manipulating the buttons and switches in order to prepare for takeoff.

I'd never flown in such a small plane before, and would have found the lack of equipment between me and the long drop terrifying on even my bravest of days. With the added suspense of not being told where we were going, I watched the ground fall away with a feeling of dread.

We flew for hours in silence. Only the drone of the engine hummed between us. Just as the sun was beginning to make contact with the horizon, and barren desert stretched out below us, he began to descend. I couldn't see any place to land, towns, cities, lights, roads. I couldn't see anything below us except flat desert until we were much closer. I started to be able to make out the outline of a narrow road with sand covering it. Ahmed set the plane down, and taxied for several hundred yards more. He pulled the plane under an open hangar. The rusted metal structure looked to have been long-abandoned and so caked with dirt and sand it must have been invisible from above.

He ushered me out, and had me take some gear from the rear compartment of the plane - a case of water and a large backpack. From the hangar, we headed out into the barren desert about a half mile. The sun had gone down by this time and the awkwardness of carrying the water had transformed my fingers and wrists into numb claws.

A dozen yards ahead of me, spotlighted in the bouncing beam of my flashlight, Ahmed was using a GPS signal to track something, but all that was around us was flat, barren desert.

Then, in an instant, he was gone.

I stopped walking, and began questioning my sanity. Even lying prone and without his gear, I'd have been able to see him. I turned to look in every direction around me, and then walked to where I had just seen him before he had disappeared. As I approached, out of the ground Ahmed's head and torso resurfaced.

"Come, come in."

There was light coming from through a round hole in the earth. I climbed down a ladder, and into a normal-looking, if outdated living room. Candles sat atop the flat surfaces in the room. Doorways beyond opened up into a kitchen, and a hallway with more doors. 

I was inside a house. Underneath the desert. 

Held prisoner by Ahmed Bari, who was already making himself comfortable on the green and orange patterned couch.

"Put the water in the kitchen." Ahmed pointed. "And you may have the last room on the left." 

I entered the dark kitchen, and rounded the corner. There I realized that we were not alone. Someone else had been sitting in the dark at the kitchen table, waiting. Watching.

I set down the water next to the one that Ahmed had brought, but kept my eyes on the silhouetted person on the other side of the room. Something about the way that they hadn't moved had unsettled something inside me. Some alarm was going off.

"Hello?" I ventured. My voice briefly echoed in the nearly empty kitchen. Still the figure didn't move.

"Huh?" Came Ahmed's voice from the other room.

"Who are you?" I called, trying hard to keep the nervousness out of my voice. 

If I looked away, and kept it in the corner of my eye, I could see that they were sitting with both hands flat on the table. were they wearing a suit? The candle light from the other room was much too weak to tell.

*Fine,* I reasoned to myself. *Another game. Another charade and hoop to jump through. Another reason to hate Sam for getting me into this. These people were monsters, and if they wanted to act like it, then that was fine. I turned my back to the figure and left the kitchen. In the living room, Ahmed appeared to be nearly asleep, reclined on the couch. I took my pack from the ground, and started for the hallway. 

"Don't worry about Ricky," said Ahmed unexpectedly.

"What, he doesn't talk?"

"No, he can't hear."

"Deaf?"

"No." He lifted himself off the couch. "He's a mannequin. It's fake. Like this house. It looks like a house, but it is only a model."

"A model house?"

"The military used to make them in order to test their weapons."

I nodded. I'd seen them in pictures and movies. They weren't any kind of place that I'd ever wanted to visit.

"Remember my rules. I wouldn't even have to kill you out here. You would find a way to die on your own."

I went to my room, set my bed and slept.

"Sam, look. I've seen Breaking Bad, okay? I know that this money has to be laundered or hidden or whatever. What good is it going to do except prove that I knew about this?"

"The money's legal."

"So that's why you told me to leave my house? Why we're hiding out in a closed donut shop?"

"Look, I brought you in because I think you deserve to know what's going on. That's also why I cut you in on it when the others told me not to."

"Cut the bullshit. What did you get into and how deep am I in it?"

"Remember when I said that I'd do anything to have connection speed like yours? That wasn't some hypothetical 'ask Santa' wish. I already had big plans for it. More than just the Bitcoin mining pools I told you about. Those brought in some initial capital, but the big fish lied in investment transactions."

"You're speaking in code."

"The stock market. It's called low latency, high volume trading, and it normally requires some very specific hardware." He could see the blank look on my face creeping back. "Big computers that can tell when a stock is bought or sold, and can buy or sell on its own at pre-set price points."

"So you legally got all this money from the stock market?"

"Yes. It may be frowned upon, but it's new enough that there aren't any rules against it, or against how you do it. With a fast enough connection and enough computing power, you can drop latency to under a millisecond. Nobody's ever done that before."

"So what? You're not a stock market whiz kid."

"Right. That's why I brought in... my friend. He lives in New York and he *is* a 'whiz kid.'"

"Friend," I made air-quotes with my fingers. Sam pretended not to see them.

"He knew the systems and strategies of the big big investment companies well enough to make improvements, but he was ultimately under-appreciated and ignored. I offered him a sandbox, with all the tools  he needed to invent his own system."

"So... What went wrong?"

"Nothing."

"Nothing?"

"It worked great. We've made lots of money haven't we? And it's only been a week."

"What the fuck, Sam? I thought someone was coming for me."

"Right... Well... That's..." I could tell that he didn't want to tell me what was coming. He bit his lip and leaned back in his chair. "Somebody knows about us. I mean, we're a small target a long ways away from them, but somebody's not happy about it."

"They think we stole their money," came a voice from behind the glass display case. A man in a disheveled blue button-up shirt with dirty blond hair, and a blazer that failed to close over his gut stood up and took a bite of a pink donut. "Fucking hypocritical of them, but that's what they say, anyway."

"Friends of yours?" I asked the owner of the new voice.

"Not anymore," he shrugged.

"So these are what, like hit men? Are they the mob?"

His laughter echoed around the room. I could hear the nights of booze and smoke that had settled into his lungs. I disliked him instantly for his obtuseness. "The fucking *mob.* Who is this guy? I think I like him." When the other men didn't laugh at his theatrics, he turned back to me. "Okay look, Junior. There's no mob, there's no hit man. There's no Boogey man or Santa Claus either. What we have here is an entitled asshole who just lost his investors a few million big ones."

"To us."

"To us. Which shouldn't include you if you couldn't fucking figure that out already."

"So what, he's going to steal it back?"

"No." The donut man said nonchalantly. "Nah - he just wants to kill us."

"KIll *you*, you mean?" I jabbed back. I saw Sam flinch a little as I said it, but as I saw it, he was as much at fault as this clown standing in front of me. I expected him to respond, but he only looked at Sam.

"Tell him! You're the one who wanted to bring him here."

"I'm sorry, man. It's your name on the bill for the internet connection. I still don't know how it happened, but whatever you got wasn't intended for you, and it didn't come out of nowhere either. Somebody spent big money for it. And now they want it back."

"So I'll just cancel it. I'll turn it off - they can have it. I don't give a fuck, I didn't ask for this."

"Whoah, there slugger," said the man in the blazer.

I stood and looked down at Sam. "Sam, I'm getting out of this. I'm turning it off." 

"You can't."

I felt, rather than heard two men move in front of the doors behind me. Sam looked up, his gaze piercing into me. "You can't turn off the connection until we're done."

"What do you mean 'when you're done?' No way! Sam! Stop this!"

"You're going to go away for a while. It's just easier this way. At the end of the month you can come back. You can have your cut. Honestly, it's for the best, this way."

The man in the blazer clapped and pointed at the tho men blocking the doors. "Alright then. Let's go."

A black bag dropped over my head.

I can't be angry at Sam and his friends. They had a good idea... a great idea, even. But in some Crichton-esque twist, while running through the whats and hows, they never stopped to think if they *should.*

Over our burgers, Sam explained what he and his friends were up to. I didn't quite follow, I was distracted by the weight of the fat envelope tucked into my jacket. He mentioned something about Phase I, bit coins, mining, hardware limits. It wasn't a business pitch, he was genuinely excited about this. He had a huge smile on his face the whole time, and he was talking so fast... Even if I'd paid attention, I don't think I could have said anything intelligent about it. My head was spinning.

*$4,850.*

*"My cut."*

When I went home that night, I didn't even log onto the internet. I had everything I wanted. I read a book and fell asleep.

A week went by and I got a text from Sam.

Get out of your house now!

I grabbed my backpack, with my laptop and the envelope of cash and left. As I was driving, I got another text.

Meet me at Henry's.

Henry's was a donut shop in the next town. I tried to text him back asking what was going on, but he didn't respond, and my call went straight to voicemail. The shop was closed when I got there. Thinking - *hoping* that it was some kind of joke, I tried calling him again.

The doors of Henry's opened and two men pulled me inside. A third extended an open hand. Not knowing what to do, I started to shake it.

"No. Cell phone. And keys, we're going to have to move your car."

Just then, Sam came over and shook my hand.  "Sorry, cell phones stay outside. It's a safety thing."

"Sam, what the hell's going on here?"

He sat me down at one of the few tables not covered in computers, cords and wires, but didn't say anything before pulling out another envelope. This one was thin, and inside was what felt like a credit card.

"$279,000, the last I checked," he said.

 Do you ever get nostalgic for your childhood? 

Want to go back and play the games and watch the movies that you grew up with?

So you'll understand what started me on the quest to get dial-up internet. It wasn't about the dial-up (though the sounds *are* pretty good memories) it was for a certain video game that wouldn't recognize anything but an old-school phone connection, and wouldn't let you play without it.

I had to go to my small-town electronics store to sign up. The place was sad and outdated. A Best Buy opened a few years ago, and I'm pretty sure the place hadn't had a customer since. I signed up for a phone line and the old man didn't bat an eye when I said I wanted to set up a dial-up connection.

Everything worked the day after I signed up. Of course, the multiplayer function of the game was abandoned, but I'd expected that. What I really wanted to do was upload the old mods and hacks and just play some rounds against the bots. I sure as hell wouldn't be able to convince anyone I knew to join in.

After a few hours, I got bored and logged out. In all, the setup had cost $27.78, and if I wanted to, I could play the rest of the month.

With the dial-up still on, I decided to try to browse the web, just to see how much faster it was now. I loaded Reddit - everything popped right up, including RES, pictures, thumbnails, video... Everything was working great - in fact, it was fast.

I went to Youtube. Remember pausing to buffer?

But it didn't even load. Videos played straight through on HD, with the highest resolution. The buffer bar was full as soon as the video started. Something was wrong. I was running multiple HD videos with no lag at all. With my normal connection, I had to wait a few seconds for even one page layout to load. 

I double and triple checked my connections to make sure nothing else was on. I considered for a second that if I unplugged it that it might not come back, but I had to know. Besides, there was no way that what I was seeing was real. *It's 56k, for crying out loud.*

My regular connection started up. It seemed slower than the dial-up from a few seconds ago, but no slower than normal. The moment of truth: I disconnected the network cable and plugged in the old-school phone line. The connection dialed, the robots had their argument and then it was on.

It was back. I was running Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Video in separate windows without a second's delay. It was unbelievable!

If you haven't noticed already, I don't know all that much about computers, networks, internet connections... Keeping in mind that I could still be doing something wrong, I called my friend Sam who actually does know about this kind of stuff.

He was extremely skeptical, but as he opened up some ominous-looking black windows and typed a bunch of gibberish, awe started to set in.

"How much would I have to pay you for your username and password on this connection?"

"What? Why wouldn't you just go start your own? It was really easy."

"I don't know that it would work. Look at this, though. This is your connection speed. Normal is like... a few digits. Yours barely fits on the screen."

"Really?"

"I would kill for even.... a ten-thousandth of this speed."

"How did this happen?"

"No idea. The weirdest thing is just that the hardware isn't set up to even process this much data. It should not be happening, basically. The only thing I can even think of is that since absolutely no one is on the grid with you, everything works for you. It's sort of like having thousands of connections at once."

"Am I going to, like, get in trouble for this somehow?"

"Well... No, I don't *think* so. If anyone found out, they would definitely cancel this though."

I did end up giving him the username and password. I put the hundred bucks he paid me toward an external hard drive, and started downloading. Movies, games, books, whatever. For most of the stuff, I clicked and it was there. I talked to Sam online that night, and he said that everything was working great on his side as well.

When he tried to set up his own dial-up account, everything worked normally - that is to say, very slowly. As he'd thought, something about my connection in particular was special. Then he suggested that we should try to sell the connections. I pretty much had access to whatever I wanted - I was no kind of power user, and when he started talking about making $1000 a week selling a connection that I'd paid next to nothing for, I was sold. I re-upped my contract, trying to hide the excitement in my voice as I told the worker at the electronics store what I wanted.

The rest of the week was quiet. On Sunday, I met Sam at a Burger place. He sat down and handed me an envelope, inside was close to $5000.

"What the fuck is this! You said ten people!"

"This is from ten people, including myself. It's your share." He took in the look of surprise on my face. "Honestly, I'm sorry it's not more."

---

There's more to this story, but I don't have time right now to tell it. I have to keep moving, or they'll catch up to me...

Sam, if you're out there. Believe me, I'm so sorry.

 "Cofee" was the name of a tiny mobile coffee shop. The kind that sells lattes out of a VW bus. It rolled into my town last fall, set out its misspelled sign and waited. The parking lot where the green van was set up wasn't far from my work. In fact, it was on the way. When I went there, I thought that it might have been closed because it was so dark inside. Just before I drove away, the modified side window slid open. There was a girl close to my age on the other side, smiling.

"Hi, can I get a-?" I started, but realized that they didn't have a menu anywhere.

Slowly, the girl squeezed her head and shoulders out of the window. For a split second, I thought she was going to climb straight into my car, but after her shoulders were clear and she pulled her hands through, she handed me a cardboard cup with a picture of a wagon wheel on the side and a white plastic lid. The whole time her face never changed. She withdrew from the window back into the dark and closed the window. I never even paid for it.

It was the most delicious thing I've ever tasted, or maybe will taste again. It was perfect in every way. It made me god damn *joyous*. I wanted to share the beautiful way it made me feel with the rest of the world, I mean it was just that fucking good.

So what that the girl inside had been acting weird? Maybe she'd been dared, or lost a bet. Maybe I was lucky she hadn't called me a "chicken fucker" instead.

I parked my car and started walking toward the front door of work. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a shadow moving between the other cars in the lot. I spun around, to check behind me, but no one else was anywhere around. As soon as I took another step toward work, a huge dog cut between the cars in front of me. I thought it might have been part wolf - the thing was huge and its black fur was matted and wild. It started growling and slowly walking toward me.

I backed away, but the dog advanced faster. I didn't know what else to do, so I dropped everything I'd been carrying and took off through another row of cars, hoping that it would give up the chase. It must have worked because I made it to the front doors alive. 

The next morning, I slept through my alarm and woke up with a terrible hangover. My efforts to get out of bed transitioned into a wild sprint for the toilet as everything I'd eaten the day before fought its way up. I was going to be late for work, so I skipped the coffee stop. As I was driving by, the memory of the smell and taste of that coffee   from the day before washed over me. There was a short line in front of the little bus, and the same girl who I'd seen the day before was leaning out the window again. Only instead of looking into the car at the window, she was looking at me.

And she wasn't smiling.

Being late for work meant that I was twice as busy as usual. I probably would have caught up sooner if I hadn't been fixated on getting another coffee at lunch. Every few minutes I was checking the clock. It didn't matter if it took my whole lunch break, I had to go back. 

Finally, my lunch break came. The afternoon sun was up, but just as before, the bus looked abandoned. Only this time, the window never opened. I waited my whole half-hour lunch break and the window never opened.

When I got back to work, I went to see my boss and told her that I was sick (which was actually still true) and needed to go home and sleep it off. She didn't seem to have a problem with it. As I was cleaning my area to leave, my friend Dan came and asked me what was up.

I should never have told him or anyone else about that coffee. He thought I was joking when I told him that the real reason I wasn't able to focus was because of a cup of coffee I had the day before. Maybe I *was* sick. I went home and tried to relax.

The next day was Friday, and I woke up feeling back to normal. I made breakfast and coffee at home, and while it wasn't as good as the one from Cofee, it did the job. On my drive to work, I thought that today would be no problem. When I passed the lot where the Volkswagen was parked, I saw that it was gone. I felt an unjustified panic seize my chest.

At work, I started noticing that several people had coffee cups with the unique wagon wheel design. Everyone seemed to love it as much as I had. When I left that night, I saw why - the green van was now parked in the back of our parking lot.

On Monday, I arrived at work to find an empty parking lot. The doors to work were still locked. I waited around for almost an hour but finally left when I saw a familiar green Volkswagen bus slowly pass by.

The police wouldn't listen when I told them that it was the coffee that killed them. They said that it was some kind of poisonous gas leak under the building that wouldn't show up in an autopsy. They never even tried to find "Cofee" or the strange girl who worked there.

As I said, this all happened last Fall; almost a year ago. The reason I wanted to tell you this is because I just saw the same black dog on my way to work yesterday, and I'm worried that Fall is coming again.

 Hey, I just found this sub today. I'm just looking for some quick sketches and ideas that I can work with. The subreddit is /r/NoSleepReruns, so I want the header to be creepy and involve a television.

Something like [Sean Coss](http://www.newgrounds.com/art/view/shawncoss/i-can-always-make-you-smile?context=ratings:etm.user:3578403.scouted:.offset:33)'s artwork, or Stephen Gammell would be super awesome, but not required.

http://i.imgur.com/zqESne8.png

I'm really excited to see what you come up with! Thank you in advance!

The girl opened her pack and extracted a fat green bottle wrapped in fur. It was one she'd used several times before for this exact dark purpose. The crumbling cork slid loosely out of the opening. She crouched next to the lifeless body at her feet, her tight leather armor creaking softly as she moved. With a muffled word and a mysterious swish of her hand, the air in front of her glowed softly, then faded.

With a frustrated swear, she repeated the charm. The light glowed a little brighter this time and Jarod, standing in the shadows, thought that he could just see the outline of a tortured face being framed in the glow. This spell faded as well, and the girl swore louder. Jarod couldn't see why the blonde thief would even bother. This area had hosted several wars throughout the years and remains were plentiful; one only needed to look around the cave that they were in to know that. Wasting an enchanted bottle to capture this spirit wouldn't bring her any fortune, especially from here. No, this was something else.

On the third try, the thief's spell illuminated a satisfied smile on her face and caused Jarod to slink behind a pile of bones. The face, glowing in the darkness, was stretched and almost as thin as the skulls lining the walls. She began to reel the spirit into the bottle with one waving hand. Obviously clumsy with magic, her brow pinched in concentration. Jarod thought how easy it would be to incapacitate the girl right now. He had cause; the body she knelt over had belonged to his mentor, a silver-robed mage that had earned some renown in a long-ago age. Therein lied the reason that Jarod stayed his attack. The apprentice felt that he had long ago gleaned all he could from the old man with his strict code and laws, and finding him dead at a cutpurse's hand lifted his spirits.

Her work was complete. She carefully wrapped the glowing bottle and set it into her bag with the rest of her collection, considered the cavern around her and set out, her new shadow creeping along the tunnels behind her.

The town of Zale, where Jarod and his master had come was due east. The girl struck a path to the south through the woods. He admired how at home she seemed to be, even as she avoided the main paths. Early on, he had summoned a sphere of silence around himself so that the girl wouldn't hear him breaking branches and twigs. Her own magic seemed to be grounded in her skill and dexterity; he hadn't heard her once. For reasons he couldn't fully explain, he was captivated by the girl; her beauty seemed to grow with each obstacle she overcame.

He began to feel the length of the trek taking its toll. Briars and branches had claimed the hem of his robe, and his cloth shoes, once cobalt blue were now brown and caked with mud. His mark emerged from the trees onto a wide dirt road. Her pace had never slowed in the brush, but now she clipped along even faster.

The road ended in a wide, flat valley that housed a community of small farms. In the center of the valley, a group of huddled buildings stood above than the rest. The sun was setting on the hills framing the village. Against its glow, the girl's silhouette disappeared into one of the buildings. That was fine by Jarod.

For twelve years the young mage had studied under his old master. Creatures, places, artifacts, scrolls, tomes... It had been an endless cycle, a tedious life. He intended to study the girl in her own environment, untainted by his observation, as he would have studied a Pixie or a Bogg Toad. He wasn't in search of companionship; he only wanted to know her, while enjoying the power that anonymity afforded him. That power swirled and mixed with the feeling of freedom inflating in his chest as he found his way to the cluster of buildings.

The only building with light and activity coming from within it was an inn that doubled as a tavern and a small trading post. A squat, mustached man frowned at Jarod's undeniably impractical and dirty clothes from behind a wooden counter. In the next room was a tavern where hardy farmers were gathered around handmade tables where they were loudly sharing cups and tales.

Jarod's hand made a subtle movement and the mustached man's frown became dulled and the light left his eyes. "I'll be needing a room and clothes. You don't need to know my name or my business, only that I wish to be left alone." He set a pile of coins on the wooden countertop. "I am quite sure that this will be sufficient to cover my stay. My key, please."

---

A short time later, Jarod descended the stairs wearing black pants and boots with a forest green traveling cloak. The noise from the small pub rose up the steps to greet him. Ignoring the man at the counter, he grabbed the handle of the door to leave. Jarod released the handle and his hand slowly dropped to his side. He turned his focus back to the bar. Standing there, next to a group of men at the table, was the one he'd been following. He walked into the bar and pulled out an empty chair at one of the tables - the only empty chair in the room. The strangers stared at him for a moment, but Jarod's gaze was fixed on the girl as she went from table to table, laughing and joking with the men she obviously knew. Her dexterity and finesse were obvious here as well, and her beauty more so. Two of the others at Jarod's table went back to their stories. The third tapped him on the shoulder with enough force to .

In normal circumstances, the mage would have resented the uncalled for touch, but the discomfort of his clothes was a constant reminder that he was in disguise. He swallowed his discomfort and looked toward the man. A thick beard was soaked with mead, and he smelled like dirt and sweat. "She's somethin' huh?"

"Something... Yes. Do you know her?"

"Sure do. That's the girl I'm gonna marry."

"You are her betrothed?"

"Well... no. She doesn't actually know me jus' yet. Gotta work up a little courage is all."

"You've never actually met her, then?"

"Oh, I met 'er. She... might not 'a got my name right..."

"I see."

"She's such a cute li'l thing. Her family's got a farm back toward the red hill." The young man tried to focus through his inebriation in order to take in Jarod's appearance. Before he could finish, the girl had appeared beside the table.

"Hi, Bill. Mort." She nodded to the old men at the table. "Another drink for both of you?" Both nodded and went back to their conversation. "And you two... well, hello. I don't believe I've seen you here before" she said, looking at Jarod. "Brothers?" Jarod glanced at the other man ogling the girl. Thick arms and shoulders flanked a barrel-chest with a wild blond beard hanging over it. The two could not have been more dissimilar.

"Ah, no. Afraid not. I'd like to purchase a drink for my new friend..." Jarod dragged out the last line, hoping that the lovestruck man at his side would offer a name. It didn't come, but the object of his affection kindly ignored the awkward pause. 

As she left, the the oldest man at the table leaned over toward Jarod. "Ye don' want to be gettin' yer hopes up with tha' one," he slurred. "Strange, she is."

"Hear tell she's a necker-mancer," the fourth man whispered loudly enough to hear over the din of the crowded room.

"She ain't no necromancer! She's a *collector*. She collects things 'n puts 'em up in her ol' man's barn.

"Well, her ma an' 'er ol' man are weird ones too. Whole family of 'em out by Red Hill."

"Point bein'... Ye're best to leave 'er alone." At this, the bearded man looked slightly crestfallen. The barmaid arrived with the drinks and smiled at everyone else at the table before locking her gaze onto Jarod. For several seconds, she just stared. Jarod shifted in his seat and felt himself start to sweat. The moment passed and her smile returned before leaving.

"She winked at me!" shouted the bearded man. She certainly hadn't, but no one was cold enough to correct him.

"You said that she's a 'collector,' what did you mean by that?"

"Naw, I said she a '*necker*-man-"

"Shut up, Mort! I already told ya, she's not a necromancer." The man turned back to Jarod. "Her an' her family aren't from here. They came from some place I never heard of. That was 'bout four, five years ago now. So they show up outta the blue, and they buy a farm and then stuff just start disappearing."

"Stuff?"

The blonde walked close by the group's table and the man telling the story lowered his voice, ominously. "Yeah, stuff. Had about five of us out in the woods picking this certain kind o' mushroom. We sit down for some lunch and when we get to movin' again, no' one of us can find our bags. A whole morning's work, gone."

"Oy, I 'ad somebody trod off with me flask once. D'ya think-"

"I r'member yer flask well enough, Mort. I r'member 'cause I saw it fall in the lake when we was out fishin'." Bill shot him a look to silence him, but the man was occupied trying to pull something out of his pockets. "As I was sayin'- er... what was I sayin'?"

"So you think they stole your mushrooms?"

"Not just the mushrooms. People started to notice they were losin' their stuff from all over town. Their old stuff. Like Grappler's gran gave 'im a locket from 'afore the war, Brawn had a set o' armor his pa gave 'im. I 'ad a nice knife from me ma... used it fer cuttin' carrots. Stuff that was right inside peoples' homes, an' it just went missin'."

"You think she's got somrthing to do with it?"

"Well I dunno if it's *her* exactly's doin' it, but she's got the stuff in her old man's barn, that's fer sure."

"Yeah 'n my flask! It were green 'n fat."

"Was it glass?" Jarod asked.

"Yeah! How'd you guess that?" the man asked in wonder.

Without pausing, he responded "If it had been metal, surely the two of you would have been able to recover it when it fell into the lake." Bill laughed loud and drunkenly. Jarod followed the girl with his eyes for a while. "So, Bill, if everything is there in the barn, why hasn't anyone gone in and taken it back?"

Bill looked around him, lowered his head so that the tip of his beard just dipped into his cup of ale, but didn't lower his voice whatsoever. "It's haunted."

Jarod perked up at this, pulling his gaze from the girl. Mort burst out, "See! That's what I' been tryin'a say. She's a necker-"

"She ain't!"

"Well then what's that I seen her doin'-"

"You ain't seen shit, Mort."

"Please," Jarod ventured softly. "I'd like to hear what Mort here has to say."

It was Mort's turn to scowl at Bill, and he relished in the moment for a long second. "As I say. I seen the girl ou' in the woods one night, 'n I think she might'a been hunting 'cause there were something dead by 'er. So's she stops 'n pulls out this little bottle - blue, like the sky - and starts wavin' her hands and sayin' some kind o' spell. Then outta nowheres, that dead thing's spirit starts floatin' up, glowin' real bright in the dark, and she stuffs the thing into her blue bottle. I think that dead thing was a man... but I never went close enough to see. Ye' ever hear anything like it?"

"Actually, I have."

"Told you!" shouted Mort.

"Now hold on! The mister din't say boo 'bout necromancers yet."

"Sorry, Mort. I don't think that she is a necromancer. I don't think that she's much of a magician at all, actually. There are simple charms that one can procure to give the power to capture a departed soul in an enchanted container. Now, do you know of why she might want to do such a thing?" Jarod allowed their silence to linger a moment before answering his own question. 

"Because she's a collector."

A smile spread back into Bill's face. "Yeah!"

The souls that she had taken were nearly worthless, but they might have contained sentimental value. However, if he could get inside the barn where she kept it, he may yet find some artifacts of worth.

Oddly, not a single customer had left the tavern yet. The starstruck young man had fallen asleep, a line of drool was strung from his beard to the table, and nearly hung to the ground.

Jarod stood, his drink was only half-finished, but he felt his balance waver for a moment.

The cool air of night blew across his body. He supposed for a moment that he should have asked where exactly the barn was, however it wasn't necessary. The mage had other means. The soft orange lights of the tiny town shrank behind him. In the darkness, he thrust his hand high into the air, feeling for the pulse of magic. Puzzled, Jarod lowered his hand. He felt magic all around him.

In the field beside him he heard rustling. It was getting closer. The young mage raised his hands in front of him, ready to react with fire and wind to whatever may come from the tall plants.

The soul thief emerged. She was wearing her thieves' leather again. Seemingly oblivious to Jrod's presence, she plodded down the road in front of him.

Jarod tried to count the number of things that had made him feel uneasy today. He traced the girl's writhe silhouette in the light, and forgot to feel uneasy. He followed.

Though something was interfering with his senses, Jarod didn't require a spell to know that the barn that he was approaching was something special. It simply hummed with mystery. Looking directly at it, the structure appeared normal. If he looked through the corner of his eyes, it appeared to have a faint glow just at the edges, as though it was filled with light and the corners sprung a leak.

Jarod was examining this phenomenon when a black boulder rolled from the edge of the road and on top of him, knocking the air of his lungs and pinning him to the ground. The boulder grabbed him began slam his head into the dirt again and again.

"Shane! Shane, stop it!"

The young mage, trapped under the huge, bearded man could not clear his head long enough to form a word or thought. He could think only of his burning, empty lungs until the weight cleared off of him.

"What are you doing?!"

"Ye know my name!" said Shane, equal parts surprised and elated.

"I know plenty, except what you're doing here!"

"Well I sees this guy in the pub an' he's watching you all night 'n then he gets up to leave. On'y he doesn't go up to 'is room, he goes outside. I was thinkin' it was a little strange to be sneakin' around at night. So I follow 'im, an' he starts comin' to your barn."

"I see. That's enough, Shane." The thief craned her neck to look down at Jarod with malice. "And you."

Jarod lay on the ground, still stunned. Something in his chest felt broken, and the pain dulled his usually sharp wit.

"You've been following me ever since I left the bar?" She pulled out a long, wickedly curved knife from her belt. "You had better start talking."

"Wait. No, I..." He struggled a moment to get to his feet, causing Shane to shift uncomfortably beside him. Jarod put his hands up in front of him as a gesture of surrender. For a practitioner of magic, however, the motion had a much different meaning. "I was drawn toward something in that barn."

"*My* barn. How do you mean, 'drawn?' Are you a wizard or something?" The knife glinted in the moonlight as her deft fingers twirled around the handle.

"A wizard?" Jarod forced a laugh. "No, no. I'm nowhere near old enough for that sort of thing. My name is Leopold Pozy, travelling musician," he finished with an exaggerated bow.

"Musician, huh? Let's 'ere a song."

"Well you see, Shane, is it? Shane, and..."

"Lexi."

"Shane, Lexi, this is the very problem which has drawn me here. I have hit a bit of a dry spell, a writer's block, a patch of creative impedance which prevents me from performing."

Jarod had seen a silver-tongued traveling musician once. He'd snuck out of the tower late at night when he was a child. Having never been out of the building, he had aimlessly walked the streets, imagining every circumstance when he might need to summon a fireball. The muddy roads had brought him to a pub where the most beautiful music and smells were wafting into the streets. Jarod stood, peering through the foggy windows of the tavern for over an hour. When the music stopped, the bard had come to speak with him. Jarod had felt in awe of how eloquent the performer was. He thought of that night as he spoke, and hoped to the gods that his speech was moving.

"I found my inspiration in the bar today; a beautiful girl with haunting grace. The rumors swirling about her proved almost as interesting as the girl herself. Rumors that seem to include the barn in question. "

"You're a terrible liar."

"Pardon me?"

"You want to see my barn, huh?" The knife stopped in her hand, and she clutched it in a slim, white-knuckled fist. "Very well. We'll all go and see what's in there, to put these rumors to rest."

Jarod's heart felt like it would beat out of his chest in excitement. His late master had always forbidden him from interacting with people outside the tower. Yet, here he was, without even using magic, he was able to get the things he wanted.

After a short walk, the three stood before the huge doors of the structure. The mage detected a faint humming in the air, and the light was more apparent now.

Lexi gripped one wooden door, while Shane grabbed the other. The doors slid silently apart, revealing only darkness. Jarod peered ahead, squinting and turning his head, but could see nothing beyond the opening. Lexi ushered him inside with a wave of her hand. As Jarod crossed the threshold, he began to see shelves lining the walls of the barn, reaching far over his head. Dark objects were crowded along them, stretching all around the structure, covering every inch of the walls.

Straight ahead in the shadows was something larger. He could only the dark silhouette against the shelves. It moved, slightly, and before Jarod realized that it was coming closer to him, a firm hand had grabbed his wrist. He tried to spin away just in time to see the barn doors slammed shut behind him.

With an explosion of sound, Jarod summoned a fireball. He was forced to close his eyes against the white light and heat, and burned into his eyelids was the image of a person in a robe. No, not a person. A mage.

Marcus the Silver, returned from the dead.

Jarod's fear possessed him, and he just managed to tear his arm away and scramble into the complete blackness. He thought of another spell; held it in his mind, ready to use it. From somewhere in front of him a terrible laughter came. He threw the spell, a series of tiny points of condensed energy slowly went forth from each of his fingertips, searching for a living thing to cling to. Their faint, shimmering light showed only an empty barn before winking out.

"YOU FOOL!" his master's voice shook the walls of the barn all around Jarod, things crashed as they fell off the shelves. The terrified mage backed against the wall. "You abandoned me," came a whisper in his ear, causing him to crawl and run forward into the center. He released another stream of fire, the impact blowing a hole clean through the wall of the barn and catching some of the things on the shelf aflame.

More laughter came, swirling and pulsing around him from all directions. Shadows moved across the walls, specters flew through the air over his head. The fire spread quickly, dropping onto the dry hay-covered floor of the barn. "What are you?!" Jarod shouted, unable to follow any of the hundreds of shadows with his eyes.

"I am death itself," the silver mage said, emerging from the flames.

"I'm sorry!"

"Sorry," he spat. "Weak. You are no apprentice of mine, just a traitorous cur needing to be put down."

"No!"

More shapes lurked in the flames behind the old man, the walls of the barn disappeared in the white light. Lexi, spinning her wicked dagger. Shane, slamming his fist into the palm of his other hand. The two old men from the bar, still sitting at the table, talking excitedly. More shapes milled around, seemingly ignorant of the flames all around him.

The barn walls spun around Jarod. He was in the cave again, surrounded by piles of bones and skulls. Lexi was there, coaxing the glowing spirit. Marcus's voice came unseen from the shadows, "You have ignored all that I have ever taught you. Here is the thief, bottling my departed spirit. Instead of defending me, your gracious master, you follow her! Chasing her further into the illusion of my creation, never once able to recognize that the world around you is a farce. Never questioning."

The cave spun around him. He was in the bar, watching himself from the corner of the room. He sat at an empty table, carrying on a conversation with the empty chairs around him. The walls of the pub faded, and he saw himself sitting in a grassy marsh, sitting on a stump, his robes soaked with filth. He looked like someone who had lost their mind.

The scene shifted around Jarod, and he was back in the barn. The flames were all around him now, he tried to shield his face and body with his arms against the intense heat, and he felt that he could hardly breathe. "Master!" he choked. "Save me!"

At once, the flames disappeared. The barn around him was empty, and moonlight filtered in through the open door. Jarod looked at himself. He was wearing the robes he'd worn at the cave, covered in swampy filth. Cautiously, he made his way out the door of the barn.

In every direction stretched an open grassy plain. Ahead, with his back turned toward Jarod, stood the mage in wavy, silver robes. Jarod stumbled up behind him, watching closely for any movement of the old man.

"Remember this day. For as long as you breathe, you will not receive a second chance." The old mage was gone. Behind him, the barn had disappeared as well. Jarod dropped to his knees and wept under the stars.

---

Lexi watched the young mage as he wept on his knees. She opened her eyes, and saw the body of the man in silver robes lying on the stone ground before her. Flies had begun to feast on the corpse, and in the hours since his death, a stench had filled the cave, more than usual.

Looking on the corpse, she thought of the advice her mother had given her study of the magical arts had first begun. *There are two kinds of magicians that exist in the world. Those who are alive, and those who are dead.*

The Silver had been too dangerous to keep alive, coming into her domain, searching too closely. She smoothed the front of her robes, and retreated deeper into the caves, her mind put at ease knowing that Jarod would never find his way back to her. She had set in motion for him a perpetual state of illusion, sustained by his own mind. The entity he'd formed in his mind of Marcus the Silver was now the image that he'd see for the rest of his life. For him, Marcus would never die.

Entering her chamber, the illusionist set the common green bottle onto its place on her shelf. Too often, the simplest illusion was the strongest. The secret behind any lie was that people see what they want to see, or are afraid that they might.

When the Silver had come into the caves, she'd adopted the persona of the young thief, the bottle and the "soul" were used as props to lend credibility to her disguise. As Marcus had thought that he was sneaking up behind a distracted thief, she'd struck him down. Noise still echoed around the caves. The second mage coming and planned to use the same deception. 

She couldn't say exactly why she'd spared the young mage. Perhaps she felt pity for him, blinded as he was by arrogance. It was a happy coincidence that the man, Mort, had crossed her path a month earlier. She had been able to use his memories to create the illusion of the town and the rest of the bar patrons. The poor man had stumbled into his own perpetual illusion at her hands. Lexi sighed, and cast her eyes along the hundreds of other items on her shelves, each representing a person caught in one of her webs, then made her way to bed. 














 There was this girl at the bar.

I know how that sounds, but she was different, strange, *alien*. I tried to talk to her, but... she just stared at me, silent. 

I left alone, but saw her again in my dreams. As I slept, she came through my bedroom window.

 Hi everyone! I just wanted to give you a quick update. 

**First off, we hit 100 subscribers! Hooray!**

Amazing. /r/nosleep really has one of the greatest communities supporting it.

If you've been here for long, you'll probably notice that I've been less active in posting stories here lately. That's because I'm helping moderate a few other subreddits and just haven't spent the same amount of time digging into nosleep. **I've been slacking.**

**But you know who *HAS* been digging through /r/nosleep for the best stories it has to offer?**

**Your faithful staff at /r/NosleepIndex!**

I can't say enough good things about what the (*creepy?*) staff's doing over there. If you don't know what **[The Index](http://www.reddit.com/r/NosleepIndex/wiki/index)** is, it's a compilation of all the series posts on nosleep.

Their most recent project is the **[Nosleep Archive](http://www.reddit.com/r/NosleepIndex/wiki/archive)**. Look at it. Seriously. Do it. Go there. If you're here to find a definitive "Best Of" /r/nosleep... It's there.

**So if The Archive is the "Best Of" nosleep, what's going to happen to NoSleepReruns?**

I'm so glad you asked. This month I tried something different on Reruns by getting rid of the requirement for stories to be "underrated." That's coming back, and Reruns is getting back to its roots. **/r/NoSleepReruns will be the place for people to share their favorite underrated, undiscovered and underappreciated stories from nosleep**... again

I want that story that the writer poured everything into, that got one upvote and a downvote and dropped off the frontpage. I want the story that *you* were the only person who ever read, but you thought it was great, and it made you afraid of the dark the next night.

Since Reruns is going be re-focused your submissions, I'm changing the format so that the public can create posts. That means *you!*

Now, [what are you still doing here?](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleepindex)

 My wife and I went camping last Friday. She died on Sunday and it is all my fault. I was the one who brought us here to the woods and in doing so, doomed us both. Three of us, if you include the new life swelling in her belly. 

We should have left that first night. The first time we saw one of *them.* It was a tiny creature, starved, filthy and wet. When the thing came begging at our tent, it was pity, peppered with hope from our own coming child that moved us take it in. We both agreed without saying a word that we'd try to reunite the pitiful little thing with its family. We were so wrong. 

I can at least take some comfort in my darling's words as she lay bleeding. 

"You could not have known."

I fear that she was right. Who could have known, save for some cold, distant God? No man could escape from these woods, me among them. I am damned.

I can hear them now, their treble laughter wafting through the darkness, creeping closer, poised just out of sight, playing with me in a cat and mouse game. Soon it will be over. Soon, the children who own these woods will come and remove me from this world.  




 This is something I wrote for /r/nosleep a couple of months ago. People didn't seem to understand what had happened. What do you think?

Any feedback is appreciated.

"No Pets Allowed"

That's what the sign had said in the rental office. I was pissed. Of course, on the quick tour of the apartment, I hadn't had time to find the dog food and collar that someone had left behind the stacking washer and dryer. Why a dog? Why couldn't it have been a cat? I'm not allergic to cats. I hadn't had any sneezing or itching eyes yet that first night, but I expected that the first time I vacuumed and stirred up all the dander settled under the carpets, I'd also be stirring up my own personal hell.

I thought about leaving, or getting a different apartment, but I knew realistically that there wasn't one. The nearby university had been growing faster than the housing market, and if I left now, with Spring term just a couple days away... I didn't even want to think about it. Not to mention the fact that I'd just spent all day moving my things in. No, I was staying.

Best to go back to the rental office, complain and hope for a carpet deep-cleaning. I picked up the dog food and collar and put them in a plastic bag. I tried to pick up as much hair as I could out of the corner as well. Tomorrow, I'd go there and let them have a piece of my mind.

3/24/2014

I ran into my neighbor as I was leaving the house. I'm in 150a, and he's in 150b. He had long hair and was standing outside smoking. Since I was carrying the bag, I held it up (in what might have been an accusatory way) and asked if the previous person who lived here had had a dog. He said that if she did, that they'd kept it hidden. He'd never heard anything. He looked like a pot smoker though, so I wonder if he would have even noticed.

The young girl at the front desk of the rental office said that she couldn't do anything about it until the owners got back at 4:00. I told her to have them call me. By 8:00, I had abandoned all hope of that happening.

Night #2 in the new place. I stayed up late (well, late for me) watching movies and putting off unpacking. At about 1:00 in the morning, I turned in for the night. Any question of how thick the walls were between 150a and 150b were quickly answered, as I heard a steady thump like music while I laid in bed. By 1:45, I was alternating between fed up and amazed. Who can listen to one techno song, loudly, for this long? At about 3:00 am I drifted off to sleep.

3/25/2014

"Shit. Literal, actual, shit, is all over my attic." The girl at the rental office was useless. It wasn't her fault that she couldn't do anything, but I didn't care.

That morning, I'd seen 150b outside, smoking again so I went to ask him about his music. I was pretty sure that he was lying when he said he wasn't even home last night, and hadn't had any music on "for sure." When I went back inside, I heard the steady rhythm again. Like a pissed off soccer mom, I power-walked over to his front door to try to catch him in the act, but when he opened the door... there was no music.

Mr. Helpful from 150b followed me back to my apartment in order to "help me find the music." He reeked like pot. I knew it. Back in the living room of 150a, the pulsing sound was louder than ever. 150b proudly announced that the sound was coming from the attic.

There must have been a raccoon or something in the attic, because when he came down, the thumping had stopped and he was holding something in his bare hand.

"Something," in this case, was a hunk of feces, one of hundreds spread around the small attic in small piles.

3/26/2014

Last night, a noise outside my room woke me up at around 3:00 am. I rolled over and brushed it off until I heard something moving around in my kitchen. Thinking that it was a raccoon or cat from the attic, I threw open my bedroom door, charged into the kitchen and turned on the light, all while yelling. 

A horrible, piercing scream rang in my ears, and in front of me, scrambling back under the kitchen table was a terrified child wearing dark and dirty clothes. I screamed in shock and if my legs hadn't buckled, I'd have run straight out the back door.

I fell against the wall, and involuntarily sat on the boxes I'd left there. The screaming stopped, and I took in the fact that there was a long cable, the kind that people use to tie up their dogs outside, that was snaking like a tail across my kitchen floor. One end was frayed, but the other led up to a collar around the child's neck. Also on the floor, were the shattered remains of a ceramic bowl.

3/27/2014

When I came back to the rental office to pick up my refund check, I noticed that they had amended their sign in permanent marker:

"*Only One Resident Per Unit* No Pets *or Children* Allowed." 









 I think we're all wondering when the next WvW thread is going to emerge,  as well as hoping that nothing is wrong with /u/Realistics. In the meantime, I thought it would be fun to run our own, informal WvW round in which anyone can participate.

**Prompt:** Where in the world is /u/Realistics?  
**Submission Deadline:** Wednesday, May 14.  
**Voting Deadline:** Friday, May 16.  
**Target Length:** ~750 words.

Edit: Last day for submissions is coming up! Thanks, mods, for the sticky.

Still wishing all the best to /u/Realistics. S/He definitely has some clever stories to come back to.

Edit 2: Great stories! I hope you all had fun, I did. Look out for another sign-up post in the future. Just the sign-ups, though, then I'll disappear too. 









 Thanks, all. I'm always impressed by the amount of talent here. 




 My friends and I used to go explore abandoned buildings. We'd been to some houses, stayed the night in a cabin in the woods, and wandered the halls of an old office building. But there was nothing like the old hospital.

Inside, it was everything we'd hoped for. A lot of things had been left behind, and it even had that sterile smell like a hospital. We came in through the main chapel, where the intricate panes of a stained glass window lay in shattered pieces on the ground. We wandered through reception and the nurse's station. Found a break area with torn couches and a broken television. The whole experience of being there fell perfectly somewhere between thrilling and creepy.

Then we went up to the second floor. The hallway there formed a big loop with rooms on either side. Overnight-stay rooms for patients, labs, test equipment, stock rooms and offices. All the doors we tried were locked. Just before we called it quits and headed back down, we saw a streak of yellow light spill out across the hall from under one of the doors.

"Hello?" I shouted, my voice echoing down the hall.

The sliver of light grew wider. A woman in filthy blue scrubs stepped out. Her tangled, greasy hair hung over her face and we couldn't tell if she was looking at us or not. She slowly turned away, and shuffled down the hall, disappearing around the corner and into the darkness. 









 Sometimes, I randomly get a pain. It's like an itch that I've got to scratch and in a moment it's gone. I always thought that it was just a random thing before today. 

I was "people-watching." For no reason in particular, I tracked one man through the crowd with my eyes. There was nothing strange about him. I'd probably passed a dozen people who looked and dressed just like him today without giving them a second glance. As I watched, I noticed that every person he came close to suddenly rubbed their skin like they had that random pain. That itch. 

Before he left, he threw something in the trash. I was curious. I hadn't noticed him carrying anything before. So I went to the garbage can and looked. And there, right on top of the food court wrappers and paper cups, I saw it. A tiny syringe. 




 I shivered myself awake. I was in my car, in a 7-Eleven parking lot, but I didn't remember driving anywhere. I didn't remember anything. I decided to get some coffee to fight off the chill and think over what happened last night.

I went to the 7-Eleven. As she rang up the coffee, the cashier pointed to the right side of her neck. "You've got something..." I rubbed my neck with my hand, and pulled away some black flakes of dried blood.

In my car again, I felt gently around the cut just behind my ear. I thought that I felt something about the size of a Tic-Tac under the skin. I tried to squeeze it out, pressing the sides of the thing like a zit. It squirted out. The tiny black object shot into the mess of garbage on the floor of the car. 

While looking for something to clean off the blood, I noticed an unfamiliar magazine and another 7-Eleven receipt on the passenger's seat. I stuck a napkin on my neck, and opened the magazine.

Colorful pictures of tattoos were on nearly every page. I came across one that looked liked it had been scribbled in permanent marker, and took a closer look. It was a bright, full-page picture of the side of a pale, skinny head. There were words written on the page of the magazine in Sharpie..

*They're coming back for you.*

There was an arrow to a spot behind the man's ear.

*Cut here.*

*Run.* 




 I shivered myself awake. It was dark and cold. The kind of chill that sinks deep inside your body and saps your energy.

I was in my car, but didn't remember driving anywhere the night before. I also didn't seem to have crashed. I was just parked next to a 7-Eleven. I checked my phone. 06:15; 7% battery remaining; no missed calls; no weird text messages.

I shivered again. Since I was already there, I decided to get some coffee to shake off the chill and think over what happened last night. As I got out of the car, a dizzy spell came over me. My eyesight went dark and I had to put a hand on the roof to brace myself. I must have stood up too fast, I thought. I waited for it to clear the rest of the way and went inside.

I entered to the familiar two-tone motion sensor chime and headed to the coffee bar. On my left, I noticed that the cashier was still sporting the unkempt remains of Mustache March. Also, I noticed that they were a woman. 

One other person was in the store, carefully choosing something from the glass drink case. We got to the counter about the same time. Him with his illegal-in-several-states size energy drink and me with my I-didn't-intend-to-get-up-this-early coffee cup. I stopped short, letting him check out first. He smiled politely, and set his drink on the counter, causing the cashier to look up from her phone with a sigh. The man in line looked back at me quizzically.

"You've got something..." He pointed to the right side of his neck. I rubbed my neck with my hand, and pulled away some black flakes like dried-on mud.

"Thanks" I mumbled back, feeling slightly embarrassed and unsure of how much more remained.

When the mustachioed lady rang up my coffee, she looked me over then pulled out a magazine from under the register and added it to my total.

"Wait. What's that?"

"What? You forget?"  She raised her eyebrow like I was stupid. "You were just in here a couple hours ago, said you couldn't pay but you'd come back for it."

"Oh. Sorry, yeah. Actually, I don't remember anything from last -"

"So you don't got the money again?"

"Yeah. Of course. Here." I handed her my debit card.

I took my coffee and magazine (*Tattoo Magazine*, boasting a picture of a heavily inked and sparsely-clothed girl on the cover) and went to my car. When I got in, I pulled down the little vanity mirror in the visor to check the spot on my neck. I was surprised to find that what I'd thought was dirt was actually a trickle of dried blood from a small cut just behind my ear. I pulled on my ear and tried unsuccessfully to get a look at it. When I let go, there was a strange tension under the skin before everything slid back into place.

I felt gently around the cut. It was puffy around the wound, but I thought that I felt something about the size of a Tic-Tac inside. I tried to squeeze it out, pressing the sides of the cut like a big zit. Pain shot down my neck and temple, but eventually it squirted out. My hand was slippery with blood, and the tiny object shot into the mess of garbage on the floor of the car. 

Freshly opened, the small cut bled and bled. While looking for something in my car to clean it with, I briefly considered using the magazine, but went for an old fast food napkin I'd found instead.

I still couldn't remember anything from the night before, but the magazine seemed like a really strange choice for me. I don't think I'd even looked twice at Tattoo Magazine before, let alone paid for one. With the hand that wasn't occupied by the napkin, I flipped through the glossy pages. 

Inside was pretty much what you'd expect. Colorful pictures and elaborate designs were on nearly every page with interviews and articles scattered here and there. I quickly skimmed each page, still clueless as to why I might have wanted to buy it earlier. Most of the tattoos were excellently done, so when I came across one that looked liked it had been scribbled in permanent marker, I took a closer look.

It was a bright, full-page picture of a pale, skinny man's head from the side. On his neck, was a tattoo of a super-realistic tree frog, but what really stopped my heart were the words written in Sharpie on the page of the magazine.

*They're coming back for you.*

There was an arrow to a spot behind the man's ear.

*Cut here.*

*Run.* 














 Just getting into writing more seriously, and I want some general feedback on what I have so far. Everything on that site is a connected story, but The Old Hospital parts should stand well enough on their own. It's a horror story, and the violence ramps up in Part 3. Thanks in advance.

I looked at Ryan and then back to rippling water in the doorway. No one was supposed to be there.  No one was there; we'd just been through every other room in the decrepit clinic.

A person would have had to come straight here like they knew where they were going. A person without a light. A person who didn't give a shit about seeing two men with flashlights in an office in the basement of a hospital that had been abandoned for over 20 years.

Or maybe it wasn't a person.

Ryan had moved his hand to his police-issue Glock, but otherwise stood frozen. The ripples in the hallway dissipated. "Ryan," I whispered as quietly as I could. My voice was the first sound audible in thirty seconds, and despite my best attempt, it shattered the silence like a pane of glass. Ryan didn't respond, except for a flick of his eyes to me and then back to the door. I took it to mean that he'd heard me. "Did you see it?"

"No."

"Is someone here?"

"... Maybe."

I took a step toward where Ryan was, close to the door. I could feel the numbingly cold water up to my mid-calf swirl around my boots. And hear it. Whatever was in the hall had to have been moving very slowly in order to keep quiet.

Ryan jutted his head out into the hall. He held his hand backwards like a relay runner reaching for the baton. I struck the weighty Maglite into his palm, which he pointed down the hall. Right, left. He looked back at me.

"Let's go. Slow. Quiet. It went to the end of the hall and to the right." I could barely hear Ryan's whisper.

I nodded and followed him out into the hallway. We took one step at a time, hugging the wall, making tiny waves in the black water but remaining silent. The term "silent as the grave" forced its way into my brain. All I could hear was my own breath inside my head. The pace was excruciatingly slow.

About 40 feet past the office door we'd left was another, larger, doorway. Beyond that, the hallway ended against another cement wall with a dark brown window set into it. A ventilation duct, I guessed.

We slowly approached the open double doorway. The beams of the flashlights barely touched the wall inside it - more flat, gray cement. As we got closer, the light panned around the room. A couple of rusted, metal, rolling tray tables. An I.V. fluid stand.

Ryan stopped and pulled his gun from its holster. I could hear his sharp intake of breath. He held it, his arms so tense that they shook. I heard splashing from the room ahead.

"FREEZE!" The word boomed through the empty hallway.

*I can't see, oh god, what is that, is that a person, what the fuck are they doing there, what the fuck are they doing what the fuck, fuck, fuck.*

"Who are you?" Echoed Ryan's voice again.

I nearly lost control of my bladder when I heard the voice that responded.

"Hello," a woman's voice, tonal but raspy like sandpaper brushed along a metal pipe, spoke from the darkness. "Yes? Can I help you?"

More splashing, someone's legs as they waded through the water.

"Ma'am, stop where you are."

"Ohhh, am I in some sort of trouble?"

Ryan paused, seeming unsure of how to respond. "Ma'am, it's not safe here."

"Bah," she hissed, and the wading continued.

I shifted, keeping one hand on the wall as I looked around Ryan and into the room. An old woman in all white was walking through the flooded room. Her skin was pale, criss-crossed by blue and red veins, made more noticeable by the harsh white light of the flashlight. You could see her slightly yellowed teeth through her parted, thin lips. A large, angry sore on her nose drew attention from the rest of her face. Her hair was gray, pinned up in a tight bun under a small white hat. She was wearing a nurses uniform.

"Stop." Ryan called again, his voice quieter, the panic leaking out of it.

With a frustrated movement of her hands, she huffed and turned toward Ryan. "Stop! Stop? You stop! I'm working here!" She splashed through the water again, heading toward an ancient, completely rusted operating slab in the center of the huge room. As if as an afterthought, she added, "Don't make me call the police!"

Ryan looked at me, confused fear in his eyes. Before he even said anything, I realized that he was out of his league. "I need to call someone, we need back up - an ambulance, maybe," he said half to me, half to himself. "This is wrong, something isn't right."  He retreated back into the tunnel and pulled out his cell phone. "Watch her," Ryan ordered, before slipping out of sight.

The woman had reached the operating table and went to work with long, bony hands to undo the rotted leather straps there. 

"Ma'am? Um, do you need help?" I cautiously offered. My own voice sounding strange to me in the large room. She didn't respond. 

I looked around the room. It looked like about two dozen overturned desk-chairs, the type I remembered sitting in during school were shoved against the right wall. The back was lined with shelves in bad disrepair. Ryan's voice echoed from the hallway as he argued with someone.

The woman, intent on her work, gasped and sniffed, the noise bringing my focus back to her. I saw that she seemed to be crying. I walked closer, feeling a sudden unexpected compassion for the old woman. I don't think I'd ever seen a clearer diagnosis of insanity.

She squeezed her eyes shut, shaking her hands out like a person with bad arthritis. I tried again, "Ma'am?"

"Your friend doesn't like me," she spat.

"Oh he's -"

"I think I *know* why."

She stretched the word "know" abnormally long, as if giving a small moan of pain. She reached a finger up to the sore on her nose, drawing blood from it with a long fingernail, but giving no indication that she'd noticed. "He's afraid of me. It's because I'm - I look like a -" She frowned with sadness, unable to even say the words. She moved her left hand to cover her face and turned back toward the table, continuing to scratch with her nails.

I turned back, feeling as uncomfortable as I could possibly imagine. I looked for Ryan in the hallway, but his flashlight was just a thin glow of light around the corner. The woman was crying again, louder now. When I turned my light back to her, I saw that the entire side of her nose was now shiny and red with blood. 

"I was pretty once," she moaned. She was scratching her cheeks and forehead with both hands now.

"Ryan!" I called, alarmed. I heard him splash through the water, but he didn't respond. The woman winced at some unseen pain, and gave a mournful groan.

"Ryan!" I yelled again, backing away from her. The woman reached her hands up, feeling along her face. She reached up to her hairline, just below the white nurse's cap and sunk her fingernails deep into her scalp. I could see the resistance of the skin and then the eight little *pop*s as the skin gave way, the nails sinking deep into the flesh. With a blood-curdling scream, she pulled down. The strain of it bent her neck.

I tripped backwards, landing in the hallway, splashing water onto the wall behind me. When I regained focus, the woman was sloshing forward in my direction. Her face was a mask of blood. It poured down, soaking her bleached white scrubs. Long pieces of skin stuck to her fingernails like tangled strips of scotch tape. I scrambled back to my feet, turning to run back up the way we'd come in.

I took a full step before I saw Ryan in his dark clothes, balled into the corner. Someone was standing over him in the center of the hall - another person in pure, fluorescent white. My screams reverberated off of every cement surface in the narrow hallway. I ran against the wall, backing into the corner at the end of the hall, trapped like an animal with nowhere left to run.

An explosion ripped through the underground chamber. My ears were suddenly in so much pain, I could think of nothing else. I opened my eyes again to see blood run like an open faucet from the wound Ryan's face, having taken his own life. His body slowly slid beneath the surface of the water.

Solid concrete behind me. Beneath me. Above me.

A tomb. That's what this place was.

The nurse had left the operating room. She wiped the blood from her eyes, and began to stagger toward me again. Purely on animal instinct, I tried to run again; to escape. I felt the flat wall behind me. A sharp angle dug into my left shoulder. I punched at the brown glass of the vent with my right hand, the one holding the flashlight. The window shattered, freeing years of accumulated black rot and pine needles in fetid rainwater. Everything was plunged into darkness. I dove headfirst up into the air vent. It was completely hopeless, I knew, but fear and need had taken over.

I had my head and shoulders in the hole, and groped for anything to pull myself with. Jagged pieces of glass cut across my belly. My hand brushed across something flat and metallic about four feet into the hole. I grabbed and pulled, hoisting my lower half up into the opening.  The metal handhold rotated in my hand - a fan blade. I planted my foot against the inside of the window frame and rammed my shoulder and head against the fan. The rusted metal tore away and I army-crawled further into the hole, the sides pressing uncomfortably tight against my shoulders. I pulled my legs up to my chest and away from the opening behind me. I stood up in the dark. The ceiling made a hollow metallic sound. I pushed straight up, as hard as I could, feeling the quarter-inch-thick steel cover slide away. I pulled myself up, out of the air duct, and found myself on the edge of the hospital's side parking lot.

I ran. An overdose of adrenaline commanded my legs. My body's momentum slammed into the side of Ryan's car. I yanked open the door and got in. The keys were under the visor where he'd left them. I struggled frantically to find the ignition, then started the car and tore out of the gravel parking lot. I didn't take my foot off the gas pedal until I reached the next town. 




 [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/21s9w8/the_old_hospital_part_1/)

"Only one place left to go."

I went first, through the heavy rubber divider and down the shallow incline. At one time, the passage had been covered in 30-foot-long slip resistant rugs. Those were now visible rolled up and laying in the still water at the base of the ramp. I felt my boot threaten to slip more than once against the slick, wet surface. I reached out and touched the wall to steady myself but quickly pulled it back, wiping it on my jeans instinctively.

Everything underground was wet. The water even formed rivulets as it ran from cracks in the cement walls. I was forcibly reminded of the dreams; dreams of water filling the world, pouring from every crack and crevice; of trying to run, only postponing the inevitable; of the people who rose up out of the water and turned to look at me, to chase me; of being pulled down into the deep, turbulent green water; of being drowned; of being killed.

I told myself that this wasn't a dream - that those things couldn't hurt me in real life. What a strange thing, to be so afraid of fear itself that you try to tell yourself *this is real.* I tried to control my breathing, but the thick smell of mold kept each breath shallow.

"Hey. You with me?" asked Ryan. I locked my wide eyes onto his inquisitive ones. Somehow, they brought me back again. I think it was the humanity, the connection that told me that I wasn't alone.

"Panic attack. Sorry... I-" I wanted to explain why. To tell him about the dreams and show that I had a good reason. I didn't. "I'm good."

"You sure? We could come back tomorrow."

"No. I need to know."

"Right. Can't be much more, this place isn't that big."

The water that covered about three inches of the floor of the basement was freezing. The cold pierced through my boots and socks, and crept up my legs. The sounds of our feet splashing bounced around the walls. On our right was a doorway; locked. I guess that's why I had brought the sledgehammer. With a deafening crack that echoed into the unexplored hall, the door was blasted open.

We walked into an office with a large walk-in file room in the rear. Nothing looked like it had been moved in 20 years. Urban explorers sometimes say that they feel a high as they cross the threshold into a forgotten place. I've heard some of them talk about the smell of those places being intoxicating.

They're right.

I walked into that room with a smile. To my left, on a waterlogged wooden desk was an electric typewriter, still plugged in. A stack of papers, rippled from the wet air, sat in the "out" box. The chair behind the desk was pushed back like the person had just gotten up and walked out of the room five minutes ago. In the filing room stood three large cabinets. Surely something was there. A name, a record, a clue to what had happened.

Ryan cracked the first cabinet with his crowbar. The old, thin metal gave easily. I pulled the first drawer out, eagerly looking inside. Empty. Not even the dividers were left. The second cabinet was the same way. We thought that the third was too, until we came to the bottom drawer. A pile of papers were sprawled crookedly, half-submerged in the murky water.

They looked like reports of some kind, like you might write for a college class. The cover sheets all said "Case study number: ######" in bold writing, and below that, "Philippe R. Menser, M.D." the insides were too detailed or too damaged to try to give a proper summary; in the first one, I thought that it might have been a trial for a new medication. Several were listed in the early paragraphs, but the latter pages mentioned nothing about them. Instead, they gave a long, detailed description of the mental state of the "subject," their habits, dietary preferences, etc. In all, there were about a dozen case studies, each containing 50 - 100 pages.

Ryan and I were looking through the papers spread across the desk by the light of our flashlights, trying to get a sense of what we'd found. Something in the hall caught his eye. His head snapped up and he glared intently at the water. His whole body tensed, then I saw it too.

The water in the hall was rippling. Something had just moved past us into the darkness.

 EDIT: For you visual people, I drew up a [model](http://imgur.com/a/FDpQE) of the first floor.

The hospital grounds sat in the middle of the town like a bullseye. This was most likely a coincidence; the oldest parts of the town were closest to the river that formed the southern boundary and over time, the town had expanded North and East. The newest building, and the furthest North, was a medium-sized retail store that the town had fought to boycott. Towns that grow over a long period of time are devoid of any master plan, since people just add what they need when they need it. In this case, the evidence all over town could be found in the large expanses of forest and sand dunes that were left between one developed area of town and the next. If a place had been too costly to build on, it was skipped over.

After the "old" hospital, which it was still referred to, was closed in 1990, the small patches of forest around it took back the grounds in only a matter of months. The building itself fell to a different sort of wilderness. Being out of view from the street below, daring high-schoolers and vagrant meth addicts moved in. in only a few days, every one of the windows had been broken out. In a couple weeks, some had tried to burn it down. After more than 20 years, it looked like the place was about to fall down.

"The police don't really come up here any more," explained Ryan. "They just kind of drive through the parking lot and check to see if the place is still standing. If it isn't on fire or there isn't a car parked in the lot, they don't even check inside." From the passenger seat in Ryan's car, it was easy enough to see why it didn't require security to keep people out. Yellow caution tape was off-putting. The collapsed ceiling and dark, metal-screened windows were threatening. The place looked downright dangerous.

"Why doesn't someone just tear it down?" I wondered aloud.

"Well, are we going to do this?" Ryan killed the headlights, casting the building in blue light from the one streetlamp over the gravel parking area. I took a sledge from the trunk I'd borrowed from Nicole's house. Ryan had brought a crowbar as well, but just in case we found anything serious in there, Ryan had brought his pistol. Guns usually make me nervous, but I counted having an armed, off-duty cop with me as a good thing.

"Now, that - " Ryan said, pointing to the chained set of double doors just to the right of a sign saying [Town] Medical Clinic, "- is the main entrance. There's no key anymore, but people have found other ways to get in." He took us around the left side of the building where we found a door propped crookedly in its frame. The nails of its hinges had pulled out of the soft, moldy wood. Once we were inside, we turned our our flashlights on and got our first look at the inside. Something about being in that place was really unsettling. Thick patches of green moss had grown over the floor and walls near the windows and  doors. Beneath the holes in the ceiling, huge ferns grew out of the dark, wet carpet. Under everything was a slimy layer of green mold. It smelled like a forest. A large beam had fallen from the ceiling across the room like a downed tree trunk, adding to the clutter and claustrophobia of the small room.

Have you ever seen the footage of scuba divers or those robotic submarines who sift through old shipwrecks and underwater buildings? That's what it reminded me of. Everything had something growing on it, and there was dust hanging in the air, unmoving. It was the silence that really drew the similarity; it was thick and oppressive, as if there were a thick, weighted blanket over everything.

That first room looked like a break room, or staff area. Against the left wall was a small kitchenette area, with cabinets along the floor and ceiling and a sink set into the counter top. Across from the door we'd just come through was a gaping black hole that had once been a doorway. Some long-ago fire had rounded its edges, leaving an oblong black portal. To the right, was a staff bathroom area, which had a couple of lockers, a shower and a toilet. We had to be careful walking across the floor. Shards of glass from the broken window and mirror in the bathroom were scattered across the carpet. Near the doorway, the fire had eaten through the floor, exposing the supports.

The next room was bigger, looking like it might have been a place to gather everyone at the hospital together at once. It had the most evidence that people had been living in it. Bottles, beer cans and black trash bags were in every corner and across the floor. A sleeping bag lay crumpled under the black, grated window against the far wall. Metal folding chairs were scattered about, casting long black shadows along the ground as Ryan and I shined our lights.

Through a larger door on the right-hand side of that room was a long hallway. This was the main leg of the hospital which consisted of five separate rooms with tattered, white curtains hanging in the doorways. I couldn't see all the way to the end of the hall. It looked like it just kept going and going. The wall on our left, opposite of the rooms, was made almost entirely out of metal-caged windows that looked out onto a small porch. During the daytime, you could have seen the trees and bushes beyond.

It was here that I began to have the feeling of being watched. The metal crosshatch pattern over the windows and abysmal blackness beyond made it impossible to see out. I imagined it was something like a one-way mirror. If someone had been standing outside, they could have been watching us like gerbils in a cage.

Ryan and I checked the first hospital room on our right. Everything had been stripped and removed, even the cupboard doors and drawers. A tiny slit of a window on the back wall of each room let in light from the one bluish streetlamp that illuminated the parking area outside.

Ryan went inside, and I stayed watch. Watching for what, I don't know, but I ended up staring into the blackness at the far end of the hall. Maybe it was my imagination or my anxiety, but I thought I heard something down there, a soft shuffle in the dark. There was no echo; being inside that place was like being in a vacuum. I turned off my light, and just looked and listened. My fear grew, as I focused on anything at the end of the hall. It was so dark, I could see the phosphene swirls I normally only see when I close my eyes. It was silent, but I was sure that there was someone there, at the end of the hall. My heart rate rose, I could feel it in my tense shoulders. Was that a sound? A whisper?

I was shaken out of my concentration by Ryan's hand grabbing my arm. "You okay?" I hadn't seen his flashlight illuminate the hall way around me.

"Yeah..." I didn't know whether to tell him that I'd heard something or whether I'd been just been daydreaming. "Let's split up, I'll check the front door and see what's at the end of the hallway."

"Sure," Ryan said, going into the second room. As quietly as I could, listening as I went, I went to the far end of the hall. The reason we hadn't been able to see anything at the end was that there was a wall made of strips of flat black rubber hanging from the ceiling. I parted them and shined my light through. The smell of mold invaded my sinuses. Past the curtain, the linoleum floor turned into finished, smooth cement. The hallway dropped off in a downward slope, ending in a pool of standing water.

Before the curtain, alongside the patients rooms, was a moderately-sized reception area. Light streamed in from the parking lot through the locked front doors. On the left was a tall reception desk built into the floor and wall. Behind that was a computer desk and some rusted-out file cabinets. The metal cabinets had signs of being pried open long ago. As was to be expected, nothing interesting was left. Whatever papers had been left behind had probably been burned, leaving more charred areas on the floor.

I turned to leave, but something behind the computer desk flashed, catching my eye. Fallen in the area between the desk and the wall was a glass frame of some sort. Mold had grown inside the glass, and water had damaged the printer paper inside, but you could still make out the words "visiting" near the top, and "unwanted" near the bottom right corner. Nothing with a doctor's name on it.

I left the reception area, expecting Ryan to be nearly done checking the patient rooms. I didn't see any light.

"Ryan?" I called weakly, moving back down the hall. The feeling of being watched was overwhelming and the hairs on my neck stood straight up. Ryan didn't answer. In the second room I found him standing stock-still, facing the wall, his dark flashlight in his right hand. He was staring at a broken mirror above a tiny porcelain sink. "Hey. Find something?" I asked cautiously, staying outside the doorway.

He turned his whole head ninety degrees to look at me, taking a full second to respond He shook his head like he was shaking off a dream, "No." He seemed to have snapped out of whatever trance he'd been in. "Fuck this place, man." At that moment, I was so glad to have Ryan with me. Who knows how long he or I would have sat there, staring off into space without the other there to pull them back to reality.

"Yeah. You get the feeling like we're being watched from out there?" I asked, gesturing outside the large, glassless windows.

"Now that you mention it, yeah. Thanks for that." He said with a sly smile, joining me in the hallway. "Only one place left to go." He pointed his light at the rubber curtain.

It occurs to me now that there was one more room we didn't check. The fifth patients room. We hadn't found anything in the other four, and it seemed like there was a slim chance we'd have better luck with the fifth. At least, that's what we thought at the time. Maybe that was where we went wrong.

"No Pets Allowed"

That's what the sign had said in the rental office. I was pissed. Of course, on the quick tour of the apartment, I hadn't had time to find the dog food and collar that someone had left behind the stacking washer and dryer. Why a dog? Why couldn't it have been a cat? I'm not allergic to cats. I hadn't had any sneezing or itching eyes yet that first night, but I expected that the first time I vacuumed and stirred up all the dander that had settled under the carpets, I'd also be stirring up my own personal hell.

I thought about leaving, or getting a different apartment, but I knew realistically that there wasn't one. The nearby university had been growing faster than the housing market, and if I left now, with Spring term just a couple days away... I didn't even want to think about it. Not to mention the fact that I'd just spent all day moving my things in. No, I was staying.

Best to go back to the rental office, complain and hope for a carpet deep-cleaning. I picked up the dog food and collar and put them in a plastic bag. I tried to pick up as much hair as I could out of the corner as well. Tomorrow, I'd go there and let them have a piece of my mind.

---

3/24/2014

I ran into my neighbor as I was leaving the house. I'm in 150a, and he's in 150b. He had long hair and was standing outside smoking. Since I was carrying the bag, I held it up (in what might have been an accusatory way) and asked if the previous person who lived here had had a dog. He said that if she did, they kept it extremely well-hidden. He'd never heard anything. He looked like a pot smoker though, so I wonder if he would have even noticed.

The young girl at the front desk of the rental office said that she couldn't do anything about it until the owners got back at 4:00. I told her to have them call me. By 8:00, I had abandoned all hope of that happening.

Night #2 in the new place. I stayed up late (well, late for me) watching movies and putting off unpacking. At about 1:00 in the morning, I turned in for the night. My questions of how thick the walls were between 150a and 150b were quickly answered, as I heard a steady thump like music while I laid in bed. By 1:45, I was alternating between fed up and amazed. Who can listen to one techno song, loudly, for this long? At about 3:00 am I drifted off to sleep.

---

3/25/2014

"Shit. Literal, actual, *shit*, is all over my attic." The girl at the rental office was useless. It wasn't her fault that she couldn't do anything, but I didn't care.

That morning, I'd seen 150b outside, smoking again so I went to ask him about his music. I was pretty sure that he was lying when he said he wasn't even home last night, and hadn't had any music on "for sure." When I went back inside, I heard the steady rhythm again. Like a pissed off soccer mom, I power-walked over to his front door to try to catch him in the act, but when he opened the door... there was no music.

Mr. Helpful from 150b followed me back to my apartment in order to "help me find the music." He reeked like pot. *I knew it.* Back in the living room of 150a, the pulsing sound was louder than ever. 150b proudly announced that the sound was coming from the attic.

There must have been a raccoon or something in the attic, because when he came down, the thumping had stopped and he was holding something in his bare hand. "Something," in this case, was a hunk of feces, one of hundreds spread around the small attic in small piles.

---

3/26/2014

Last night, a noise outside my room woke me up at around 3:00 am. I rolled over and brushed it off until I heard something definitely moving around in my kitchen. Thinking that it was the raccoon from the attic, I threw open my bedroom door, charged into the kitchen and turned on the light, all while yelling. A horrible, piercing scream rang in my ears, and in front of me, scrambling back under the kitchen table was a terrified child wearing dark clothes. I screamed in shock and if my legs hadn't buckled, I'd have run straight out the back door.

I fell against the wall, and involuntarily sat on the boxes I'd left there. The screaming stopped, and I took in the fact that there was a long cable, the kind that people use to tie up their dogs outside, that was snaking like a tail across my kitchen floor. One end was frayed, but the other led up to a collar around the child's neck. Also on the floor, were the shattered remains of a ceramic bowl.

3/27/2014

When I came back to the rental office to pick up my refund check, I noticed that they had amended their sign in permanent marker: 

"*Only One Resident Per Unit* No Pets *or Children* Allowed." 









 This whole situation just hit a new level of weird and terrifying.

If you want to read about what's happened to me before, you can go [here](http://goo.gl/u84b4A).

I'm still having the dreams. Always with those fucking dreams - sinking, being closed in on, isolated and killed. Over and over. But really, the worst part about them is that for half of the time I'm dreaming, I can't even tell the difference between it and reality. I wake up, I do normal things, I move on with my day and then things take that awful turn.

Today, if I am dreaming, it just got so much worse, and I can't wake up. However, I think this was real.

I woke up (I work nights, so this was in the afternoon) and as I drove to work around 7:30 pm I saw the old man who broke into my house a few weeks ago. He was standing, dripping wet, wearing the same clothes as that day that he came into my house. Standing under the overpass behind a short, chain link fence, I could see his one good eye tracking my car. I nearly rear-ended the car in front of me because of while I watched him.

But again, that's how my dreams start. Everything's normal and then some part of reality shatters like glass and that's the first sign that something is wrong. Then it breaks more and more and by the end...

But this wasn't a dream. Maybe if I say that enough, even *I'll* believe it.

I went to work, which has been its own mess, and zombie-stumbled my way through again. I only vaguely remember my boss telling me about how I've been acting different, that he's worried about my performance. It just doesn't seem worth concentrating on, especially with my mind on the fact that the old man was back. What was he doing there?

I drove back home, arriving at about 4:30. Early morning is about the only time I enjoy it here. It's cool and calm, unlike the rest of the day. As much as I thought I wouldn't, I miss the hell out of Oregon.

This is what I was thinking when I walked up to the front door, and with key in hand, in the brief light of a passing car, I saw him through the window. He was standing, crouched on the dark stairs. I could just see his feet and torn pants, and the bottom of his old rain jacket as he sat about eye-level on the stairs above me.

At first, I didn't react other than backing away from the door. I was so shocked at what I'd seen that I couldn't even form a plan of what I wanted to do. Then I ran. It wasn't the reasonable thing to do - I should have called the police again, but with the last two times that they've come ending with my own interrogation and nothing good coming from it, I subconsciously decided against going down that road again.

So I ran. About a minute after starting, I think I forgot why I was running and just... blacked out. I guess it was sort of like being in a daydream, except there was no dream. It was actually nice.

I found myself in a small park at the end of a dead-end residential street, just as the sun was beginning to come up.  I sat on the swings while I caught my breath and called the police. The dispatcher said that they'd send someone, but that my address had a note against it in their system and that I should meet them in the parking lot that I share with the other houses in the area.

I agreed and started jogging back. How had I run this far in slacks and dress shoes?

On my right, I could see the road that I'd driven this morning, the various overpasses, exits and signs filling with red taillights of people going to work. I was really close to where I had seen the man this morning. Close enough that I could take a minute and see if anything was there, I reasoned.

I left the sidewalk and followed a dry, dusty path beneath the overpass. There were a surprising number of footprints and trash all around. People had obviously been living there. Were living there. I thought, a little further back there might have been a sleeping bag in the corner where the cement pillar met the ground. At the bottom of the hill was a small... I can't call it a pond, but it was standing water, and all around the edge where it had receded in the recent heat was trash and various debris. Everything you might expect to find except, floating near the edge was a wooden oar. I remember thinking, *what the fuck is that doing there?*

My minute was up; I turned to go, but silhouetted against the rising sun was a profoundly greasy-looking man in an old rain coat.

He moved with startling speed, having the upper ground and the element of surprise. I tried to run, but in the soft sand, I managed to take only a couple of steps before he was upon me. I crouched, bringing my center of gravity down, and then exploded my body upwards into his. The stink of alcohol, body odor, and garbage was overpowering, and he was still very wet. He fell down the hill, crashing down onto the edge of the not-pond.

Unfazed, he got up, grabbing the oar with both hands. Again I tried to run, but he was faster. He brought the oar down on the top of my head with a low, fleshy crack. Things went dark. I could feel myself being picked up and dragged, and I thought I could hear a little girl screaming...

I felt my body lifted up high into the air, and cleared up enough to make out the man screaming "... be baptized and ye shall be free!"

I was in the water again, disoriented and now unable to breathe. I opened my eyes, but the only thing I could see was the man's face and arm, under the water holding me by the throat, bringing me down further into the water. I reached for the bottom, anything to get a grip and push off of. *How is it so deep?*

The water started to froth and bubble around us, and soon I couldn't even see his face. I kicked wildly, and finally connected with something. He let go, and I was free-swimming in the deep water. I figured out which way was up by following the bubbles, and after another few seconds, broke the surface. The air felt cool on my fiery lungs.

I wasn't in the not-pond anymore. I was in the middle of a large lake, near a dark green fiberglass rowboat. I scrambled up onto it in my panic. Where was the man? Where was I? What the fuck just happened?

I sat in the boat, curled into a ball, just breathing for several minutes. I hadn't heard a thing break the silence on the lake around me. I peered over the edge and saw the man, floating face-down in the lake, a dozen feet from the rowboat. I took the paddle and set off toward land.

After a few paddles, I realized that this was the lake that I'd been thrown into before. I was back in Oregon - back in my hometown, even. I paddled up to the bank, toward the only house I still knew in the area, Nicole's.

After spending the day in police custody, they finally released me back to Nicole's where I'm writing this now. As I said, things have drastically escalated, and this is far from over.

I can't go back home. I'm here. And despite feeling like I've fallen into my own Twilight Zone episode, there's also a feeling of being back home... So now I'm going to get to the bottom of this thing. Nicole has agreed let me stay, so long as I try to keep her out of whatever is going on.

Tomorrow, I take my first step toward solving this. Wish me luck. 









 I haven't gotten any comments and don't have any IRL people to show it to. Read a sentence or the whole thing and let me know what you think! This is the longest thing I've written and I'm at the point where I'm not sure if it's worth going on, or if there's something I could be doing better. Seriously, tell me how much it sucks. Tell me how bad blogger is. Just tell me if you *didn't* read it, at least that's something!

Thanks in advance.

 Hi everyone. I'm starting to get into writing as a hobby, and right now I'm working on a series for /r/nosleep. I'm not getting a lot of feedback there, though. So... 

Thoughts? Questions? Smart remarks?

Leave your constructive criticism in the comments [here](http://atomgrayhome.blogspot.com/). 




 I'm back home.

"Home."

What is home?

Is home where you go at the end of the day? The place where you park your car? Where you sleep? Because if so, then yes. I'm home now.

But maybe home is where you come from; where you were born and grew up. The place that formed you into the person you eventually became.

Maybe it's the place where you feel like you belong. That part of the world that continues to shape as well as reflect you. Like when you tune a guitar and you can hear the dissonant vibrations getting smaller and smaller until the sounds become indistinguishable from each other. A place that resonates with a person. That sounds like home to me.

In any case, I'm back from my trip to Oregon, my hometown, and the nightmare going on there. You can read about that here:

[1](http://goo.gl/mUbcoc),    [2](http://goo.gl/3jXhS8),    [3](http://goo.gl/Omv2sC),   [4](http://goo.gl/51dlgg)

I've had a really hard time dealing with everything over the past week. I haven't slept. I go back and forth between wanting to figure out what's happening there and getting frustrated when I can't find anything new. I should probably just consider myself lucky to have gotten away alive. I wish that I could just forget the past and move on.

But growing up in that town has rubbed off like a stain on my mind. Going back and *dying* there... 

For starters, I see my sister now. That sentence looks insane sitting on the page. I feel insane. But I'm too tired and too scared to deny that it's true. I see her nearly every day. Sometimes, especially after more than a few drinks, we'll even talk. What's weird is that her presence seems normal now. What could be normal about seeing your dead sister's ghost walking around in your house? Though, I'm not even sure that she is a ghost. I think there's a chance that she's always been there, but I just couldn't see her.

I wish I could ask her what's going on. I wish I could ask her for help in closing whatever I opened by going back to that town. But I can't, because aside from being dead, she's just a normal four-year-old who doesn't know much.

"Marissa, where does your daddy work?"

"He makes the Monster 'Messanin' at the fac-tor-y. He makes the Monster Messanin!"

"What's Monster Medicine?"

"Um. It's a messanin."

"Do you take Monster Medicine?"

"Yes."

"Why?"

"'Cause I go to sleep, and I eat the messanin!" she says, jumping on my bed.

[Newport Pharmaceuticals](http://goo.gl/5MeEOf) is still around, by the way. Please don't bother them. I wrote them an email through their website to ask if they'd ever owned a factory or laboratory in Oregon near my town, and I got a response a couple days later saying that they had no records of it. The company has primarily moved to Europe though, and no longer operates near Newport Beach, California or Newport, Oregon (which, to clarify, is not the town I'm from though neither are far away). 

So that's a dead end. Again. I'm not sure where to go from here. 

I don't know what else to ask her, though. Like I said, most of the time she's mute. Sometimes she's here and other times she seems to disappear. Most of the time, she's sad, and I've heard her crying at night. Physically, she seems normal, except for a long scar on her head where her hair doesn't grow. It looks like I'd imagine a brain surgery scar would look like, but I'm not sure. I can touch her, but she draws away, like the contact causes her discomfort.

Two nights ago, I got back from work after dark, exhausted. I re-heated some pizza and shakily poured myself a drink, sat down and flipped through the pages of Reddit. My eyes were already heavy, and after nodding off on the couch a few times, I got up and started to clean the kitchen before going to bed.

Marissa had shown up, and I could see her pacing in the hall to my left as I faced the sink. I had turned the garbage disposal on and was spraying out the egg shells and coffee grounds from the morning down the drain when I noticed that she had stopped moving.

I finished spraying out the sink and loading the dishwasher, then looked up at her, which made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. She was backed into the corner where the floor meets the wall, with one finger pointed straight out at something behind me.

I slowly turned and like a nightmare you wish you could wake up from, saw a man in shabby clothes standing in the doorway to the living room not six feet away from me. I have no idea how long he was there watching me. He was wet, his long hair and beard were scraggly and matted, with streaks of gray.  I froze again, not sure what to do or which way to run.

Then he flashed a smile, as if he'd been waiting to be acknowledged. I noticed that one of his eyes was pure, milky white. He anxiously pawed at his neck like someone satiating a nervous tic. "You're not supposed to be here," he said, his face sinking into a confused frown.

"Okay, whoah, if you're here to rob me... I don't have much. Take what you want and just go."

"Rob you?" he asked slowly, as if processing each word separately. "No. No, no, no, no." With each word, his eyes traced some invisible thing moving back and forth across the floor. His hand shot up to his neck again. "It's already mine. You're dead." The man backed up through the door into the dark living room and disappeared from view around the corner.

I left through the front door. On my way out, I heard him yell from the living room, "Jesus continued: There was a man who had two sons!" before I shut the door. I called the police from my cell phone, telling them what had happened. When they came to the house and searched it, they didn't find anyone, though the sliding door in the living room was left open.

Then the smelled the alcohol on my breath and began to question me. You could see the exact moment that each officer lost faith in what I'd told them.

"So tell us again what he looked like, sir."

"Like I said, he had gray hair and a beard. Maybe 40's or 50's? About the same height as me, and he had a dark raincoat on."

"A raincoat? What color was it?"

"I couldn't tell, it was all wet."

"It was wet? Is there a river or a lake around here?"

"Um... No. It was probably wet from the rain. Like he walked in from outside."

"Sir, it doesn't look like it's rained for a week here..."

They left pretty soon after that. Finally after triple-checking that I'd locked all the doors and windows, and as many drinks to calm my nerves, I laid in bed. The door opened and Marissa came in, crawling up onto the foot of my bed.

"Who was that?" she asked.

"I dunno. Some tweaker."

She laughed. "Like Tweety Bird?"

"Yeah, if Tweety Bird was a drug addict."

"Oh," she said very seriously, with feigned understanding.

God, I'm so tired. I wonder if this even makes sense anymore. 

What if I really did imagine the man? From the white eye to the wet rain jacket... two sons... What if I really am losing it? Or what's worse, what if this is all real? I just don't know anymore.

What do I do now, /r/nosleep? 









 I don't know where to start. If you haven't read the rest of this series, you may want to do that now, in order for this to make sense. If this even can make sense.

Last week my uncle, the last living relative I had in my hometown, died. With him gone, the police and other prominent members of the town had me followed away from town. They also took some pictures which had revealed after my mother's death that I had had a sister who died before I was born.

The police warned me not to get involved. They said it would be better if I got away while I still could. They said that the people who were at my uncle's house after his "suicide" were dangerous people. People capable of making someone, a child, disappear. 

In spite of that, I had to know. If I'm being really honest, what I wanted more than anything else was to finally put my past to rest. That's the real reason I came back to Oregon after my mother died. The feeling throughout my whole life that the town I'd grown up in was rotten, backwards and wrong.

After I was sure the police had stopped following me, I turned around and came back to my mother's house. I'd been staying there and doing research on the town. I'd started with some of the prominent members of the town and their families.

What I learned is that many of the older adults who "run" the town, from the fire and ambulance services, to the schools, construction, police, commerce, and even the mayor have something in common. They all have past records of being homeless. Almost every well-known person in town that I could think of had something like this. Suspiciously missing from this list was Pastor Charles, the massive man who operated the local church. This wouldn't necessarily mean anything, of course. However, it did seem strange that all these prominent people had come from around the country, and in fact the world, to this one small town and had all done extremely well here.

I began to shift my search to what might have drawn them here. In the 1960's through the 1980's, jobs had been as plentiful as the trees here. Then in the 1990's, those jobs had dried up.

I found a few old scans of newspaper articles from the 1990's (since none of the people who were still here were involved in the fishing or timber industries), but none of them showed any kind of attraction to this town in particular. Good schools, fast growth, but little else. So I went to the library, where they kept a near-complete collection of local newspapers and found a front-page article from 1985, which included a black-and-white picture of a ribbon-cutting ceremony in front of a huge pharmaceutical plant. A man in a black suit who I didn't recognize was holding the scissors in the age-old pose, but it was the people behind him that shocked me. There they stood, half of the people I felt were responsible for whatever was wrong with this town. And my father in a white lab coat.

I went to print the page article and got an error message about paying a fee to the librarian. Stupidly, I went to the front desk. As I approached, the girl working there did a double take, and then slowly got up and walked to the back room.

It was time to leave.

I got in my car and scribbled down what I could remember from the article. "Newport Pharmaceuticals Plant Opens Doors." "55 new jobs." "November 13, 1985."

I'd never heard of any kind of plant near here or "Newport Pharmaceuticals." As far as I'd known, my father had moved here shortly after he was born, and the whole time I'd been growing up, he'd never had a job for longer than a year.

I headed back to my mother's house to see what I could find on the internet. I hid the car as before and walked up to the front. I was walking up the driveway when I saw the neighbor sitting on the front porch. She'd seen me, so I couldn't get away, though she was smiling as if she was happy to see me.

She said she was locked out of her house, and came to see if my mother had a spare key. She must have been going absolutely senile, because she didn't even seem to realize that she hadn't seen me since I was 18. In fact, the last time I'd seen her was after one of my mother's fits when she'd kicked me out of the house. I'd ended up going next door and having dinner. Even though I'd had to sit through an hour of her and her husband tell me about how it wasn't that bad and that I should forgive my mother, the food had at least been good.

I told her that my mother was dead, and she looked so sad. "Oh no. Oh, you poor thing," she said, coming closer with her arms outstretched. I half-heartedly returned the tiny woman's hug, eager to get inside where I wouldn't be seen, when I thought I felt an insect sting me on my ribs.

I went to brush it away, but didn't feel anything remaining on the spot where I'd felt the bite. Then I realized that the old woman was smiling widely again. I started to feel dizzy, and tried to escape back to my car, but before I could even make it off the porch, I was unable to walk. Suddenly, several people came from inside the house and carried me into a car.

They drove me to the lake, and loaded me into a small boat. Two older men, one who owned a furniture store in town, and the other who I'd seen before, but didn't know his name, took me in the boat to the deep center of the lake.

[I don't swim.](http://goo.gl/Rk6nmc) I haven't been able to get over my fear of open water since I was 12 years old, when I saw something terrible lurking deep under this same lake. It was dark now, the only lights were the colored running lights. I fought to move, to fight, to get away, to scream. Anything. I couldn't move. I could barely breathe, my chest felt like it was being crushed. The two men were waiting for something that I couldn't see, and after what felt like an hour, I finally gave up. I felt cold, and tears streamed down my face as I lay in the bottom of the fishing boat.

One of the men broke the silence, "There. Let's do it."

One grabbed my arms as the other grabbed my ankles, and with a grunt, they heaved my body like a bag of cement over the side of the boat.

I know that I drowned. I felt every second of it, clearly as I am sitting here typing this out. The fear forced the precious air out of my lungs and I sank, serene and peaceful, down into the black.

Inside my mind, a primal panic broke loose again, creating chaos but my body remained motionless. The last thing I remember was the intense pressure, and the sensation of losing consciousness.

Then, impossibly, I woke up. It was almost like going through a door, on the one side was one world, the world you feel when you're awake, the "real world." And then on the other side, I woke up into a completely different world, in a different place. I wasn't in the lake any more. I stood up in the middle of an empty house I'd never seen before. There was enough light to see around myself, but it didn't seem to be coming from anywhere, like maybe I was glowing.

I walked from the living room into the dining area, which had a large table and was set for seven. I heard a sound, like a child giggling and small footfalls coming from the doorway on the other side of the room.

"Hello?" I tried to shout loudly, but no sound came out. I ran through the doorway into the kitchen, and heard more footsteps sounding like they were going upstairs. I ran after the sound and came to the top of the steps. The door on my right was open slightly, and I could hear a child laughing and talking on the other side. I pushed it open slowly, and there sat my sister who I'd never known, playing with a pair of knitted dolls. She like she was about four years old, just like she'd looked in the pictures I'd seen of her.

She looked up at me as I walked in with a big, sweet smile and then held out one of the dolls for me to take. Jesus Christ, I got down on the floor in that dark, otherworldly house and played dolls with my dead sister.

Then the sound of a door opening and closing came from the bottom of the stairs. My sister looked sad. "You have to go," she said. "I hope you come back. I don't like it here. He's not nice."

I tried to ask her *who?* but still no sound came out. Heavy steps were coming steadily but slowly up the stairs.

The bedroom door opened, but all I could see on the other side was blackness, then a huge, bone-white hand shot out of the darkness, grabbed my whole head and pulled me through the door. I woke up in the lake again, able to hear something crashing through the brush on the banks. I dragged myself onto the shore, and heard a woman's shrill voice yelling "Oh thank God, you're alive. Are you okay?"

The woman's name is Nicole. She took me out of the lake and to her small house in the woods near the lake. I'm alive, and feeling better now, thanks to her. I don't know what to think anymore. Tomorrow, I'm leaving the state and going back to my old life. I think it's clear that what's going on here is beyond me. If any of you have any idea of what's going on here... please, help me.

I should never have come back home.

EDIT: Linked the story of why I don't swim in that paragraph.

[Update](http://goo.gl/tzrLPP) 




 When I was young, my friends and I would play hide-and-seek in the woods near our houses. The "woods" were actually an overgrown, undeveloped lot surrounded on all sides by residential or commercial areas. 

Let me tell you, I was the *KING* of hide-and-seek. I hid in the same spot every day, but no one ever found me. See, most people thought that the woods had always been overgrown, but one day I crawled on my stomach to under a thick patch of brush and cam face-to-face with a tombstone.

[Update 1](http://goo.gl/3jXhS8)

This morning when I finally reached town, I noticed a squad car tailing me. It followed me all the way up to my uncle's house on the southern edge of town. The police officer never turned their lights on or anything, but it wasn't exactly trying to be subtle.

I parked in the driveway, and stayed in the car. The squad car parked behind me. Two overweight officers got out and slowly walked over to flank my rental car. "Good afternoon!" said the officer on my left. His voice was young, causing me to do a double take.

"Ryan?" I said.

"Hey Adam." He said sheepishly. Ryan and I had been in the same class in school. We weren't close friends, but when you've known someone through 12 years of school and grew up in the same small town, you get to know them.  "Listen, Adam. I'm afraid I've got some bad news."

My uncle is dead.

Ryan and the other officer who I didn't know both tried to stop me from going into the house. They said it was suicide. He hanged himself in his bedroom. I told them that all my belongings were inside the house, and firmly told them to let go of me.

Ryan told the other officer to wait while he escorted me inside. In the living room, there were several people, a few who I could recognize. The pastor of the local church, the old lawyer, and a few other people I knew from around town.

As soon as he saw me, the pastor came over to me and Ryan purposefully. "Adam. You really shouldn't be here right now," he said.

Just looking at him, made something rise up inside me. Learning about Marissa yesterday, and having this hostile greeting today... The fact that all these people had suspiciously shown up here at my uncle's house, and now I wasn't allowed. I opened my mouth to tell them all to get the fuck out, but thought better of it. I didn't need to get off on the wrong foot with all these people at once. "I'll just grab a couple things and go," I said, and walked purposely toward the second bedroom that I'd been staying in.

Behind me, I could hear the pastor whispering harshly to Ryan.

Once in the room, I shut the door. Quickly, I threw my few clothes and belongings into my backpack. Clearing the small desk, I noticed the plain envelope that had contained the pictures from the night before. It was empty.

I searched around on the floor and under the bed when I heard someone open the door. It was Ryan. "All right, Adam," he said, "you ready?"

I looked at him, taking in his expression, and sizing him up. Who the fuck could I trust anymore? "Something is missing," I said flatly.

"Sorry about that. You could try asking the people out there if they've seen it. But..." He stepped inside and closed the door behind him. "Adam, they want you *gone*. I'm not charging you with anything, but they're starting to whisper that you had something to do with your uncle's..."

"What?"

"Hey I'm not accusing you of anything, like I said. But I think you should get out of here. Now. Leave town and don't come back. These are people you don't want to get mixed up with. Dangerous people." His face was deathly serious as he said these last words.

Someone knocked on the door and started trying to push Ryan out of the way.

Pastor Charles was a huge man. He must have been about 60 years old now, but I can still remember him closer to his prime playing sports with my father when I was much younger. It was as if every aspect of himself was hand-picked to make him physically imposing. He stood at 6'6" and wrapped in muscle. His customary black suit was fit him like he'd been poured into it. As a kid, what had scared me the most about him had been his left eye, which was pure milky white and completely blind. He pushed his way into the room, and reached to grab my arm. 

"It's time for you to leave, child" he said, staring at me intensely at me with his one good eye.

I told him to get off of me and stormed out through the living room. The people there had all joined hands, with one opening presumably left for the Pastor.

Ryan's squad car followed me a few miles outside of town before turning back. This whole thing has me really scared.

What was that? Is this how law enforcement usually handles a suicide?

Maybe this was stupid, but I went back to my mother's house. I took another road that skirted the edge of town so that any police that were posted on the highways wouldn't see me. I drove by once to check that no one was there, but with my deep tire tracks and disturbed gravel still there from when I left, I was fairly certain that no one had been there since that night.

I hid the car on a side street and walked back. In the afternoon sun, the house didn't seem as menacing. I opened the front door and quickly slipped inside before anyone could drive by. The carpet in the living room was still dark and smelled strongly of mildew from the spill, the TV screen was still broken and gaping. Everything looked just like I'd left it. I shivered as I looked at the spot on the couch where I last thought I'd seen my mother.

Maybe I'm crazy, and maybe this won't help. This might even be a really bad idea, but I just need somewhere to think. I've been feeling like there's some kind of purpose for my coming back to Oregon. Like something drawing me here. Maybe it's Marissa, or maybe it's my mother. Either way, I'm not taking any action just yet. I'm going to spend a few more days here to see what else I can learn about my sister and my uncle's death.

I can't just run away from this. Not yet.

EDIT: Sorry I can't update any of you now. Since I got here, I've been feeling sicker and sicker. I slept feverishly all night and day today. Feeling too weak to even do anything else. When I'm back on my feet, I'll clue you all in on what I've turned up in my search of the town's history. Unfortunately it's not good news.

 [Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1xlpn8/come_back_home/)

Sorry for not updating you sooner. As some of you know, I recently came back home to the Oregon Coast because of my mother's death.

Last Thursday I went to her funeral. The service itself was somber and... respectful. My mother had made very few friends in her life. Not that her family had ever mistook her for a friend.

The next day, we got a call from the elderly lawyer who was handling her estate. As I said, apparently I was named for something in her will, even though she had said I would get nothing. That afternoon we met with him in his small office.

"Thanks, gentlemen, for coming in today. I called you in to discuss the last will and testament of the deceased Rachel Smith. Henceforth referred to as 'the deceased.'" What followed was a listing and rather boring conversation about the things that my mother had owned. I sat awkwardly, feeling out of place wearing torn jeans and hoodie in the lawyer's clean, new office. Even worse, was the nagging thought that had my mother not hated me, I might have been the one having this discussion right now instead of my uncle.

"Finally, Mr. Gray." The lawyer said, continuing his drone.

"The deceased has specified that you are to have this." The lawyer pulled a plain, white envelope from his folder and placed it face-down on the table in front of me. "This concludes today's business." He read off of his notes, showing an expression of surprise that it had ended so abruptly, checking the back of the page, as though he had expected to go on quite a bit longer. Then he looked intently at the envelope and at me, then to my uncle. I could be wrong, but I thought he looked nervous at whatever was in the envelope.

Since I wasn't sure what was going to be inside, I stuffed it into my wallet without looking at it. If it was a message from my mother, I didn't need to be getting emotional here, in front of anyone and everyone.

I fell asleep in my uncle's truck on the way back and had a vivid dream. It's a dream I'd had before, when I was young. It starts out with a faceless marionette in one of those little curtained booths. The puppet looks like it's trying to talk to me, only I can't hear, like I'm deaf. It looks over it's shoulder and turns to me like it's pleading, but I can't help it. Then my mother's face lowers from behind the curtain on the top, with a huge smile.

I woke up as my uncle pulled into his driveway.

I waited to open the envelope until after midnight when my uncle went to bed. Inside were four faded pictures of a girl I'd never seen. She looked to be about four years old. The first two pictures were of her walking outside. The third was of the little girl on a stage of some sort. The last picture made my hair stand on end though, because it was the little girl being held by my smiling mother and father inside the first house I ever lived in.

I flipped back to the previous picture, and recognized the stage as being from the church that my father had taken me to as a child. In the background, you could just make out other children standing in a row, their parents behind them.

I focused on her face, her blond hair and blue eyes. She looked so much like my mother. Like me. 

In my head, I heard the small voice that had whispered in my ear my first night back home.

"Unwanted."

In the corner of my eye, I saw something move in the shadows. I jumped off the couch and turned to face it. My uncle was standing there frozen.

"Adam." He said. I could tell in his eyes and tone of voice that he knew what I'd seen.

"Who is that?" I asked, the fear and hurt tightening the muscles in my throat.

"Adam, I'm so sorry. Adam, I want you to know... I thought they should have told you. I tried to tell your mom. She wouldn't listen to me though."

"Who *is* she?" I asked again, louder as I held out the pictures.

"Her name was Marissa. She's your sister."

"What?"

"She died before you were born. Your mother... She threatened everyone so that they wouldn't tell you. She tried to act like it never happened, that Marissa had never been alive."

Hot tears stung my face now. I'd known my mother had been crazy, but to have had a *sister*, and to have had the whole town cover it up. I looked at my uncle, ready to scream at him, but then I saw that he had tears in his eyes too. His expression was so guilty. So sad. You could tell that he thought he deserved whatever I could do.

I deflated, sitting back down on the couch and dropping the pictures onto the ground. He came and sat next to me, and wrapped his arms around me.

Today I drove to see her grave.

Marissa Gray
1984-1988

The grave site was almost two hours away from the the town we lived in, the graveyard where we'd buried my mother three days ago. It was inside one of the largest graveyards in the county. A simple granite plaque, just one among hundreds. It took me most of an hour to find hers.

I stayed for a while, just staring, wondering what my life would have been like had she not died - wondering whether I would have even been born. I put off getting back in my car. The truth was out now, and eventually I'd have to go back, knowing that everyone in my small hometown had been carrying a secret - keeping it from me. A thousand little uncomfortable silences and awkward stares started to make sense. 

A dark cloud moved in front of the low sun and shot a chill down my spine. You know that feeling of being watched, even though you *know* no one is around?

With that, I figured it was time to leave, and briskly made my way to my car. As soon as I turned the key in the ignition, heavy rain started to pour down.

*Oregon*, I thought to myself.

On my way back West, the rain got worse as the sun dropped behind the hills ahead of me. One thing about this area, is that it's full of back-roads. One wrong turn and you could end up 40 miles in the wrong direction. Even though I'd driven this road dozens of times, before long everything started to look unfamiliar.

Wherever there weren't trees overhead, I had to slow down to a crawl just to see the road through all the rain. I came around a turn and out of nowhere, I saw something huge in the middle of the road. I slammed on my brakes and turned the wheel, and skidded off into the gravel shoulder. Behind me, in the middle of the road I could just make out a pair of traffic barriers.

I heaved a sigh of relief that I hadn't crashed and reversed out of the ditch. My headlights illuminated a wooden sign on the side of the road that just said, "Welcome to," which stuck me as being really unusual.

I stopped at a bed   breakfast not far up the road from there to ask for directions, but the owner kept smiling and seemed so happy to see me (and was so bad with directions) that I decided to stay the night here instead.

At least they have free Wi-Fi.

Tomorrow I'll go back and try to find out more about Marissa. I don't think this is done yet, /r/nosleep. How does a person convince a whole *town* to not tell them about their family? About the people they grew up with?

I tried calling my uncle, but he didn't answer. I think I'll try to get some sleep and head back in the morning.

EDIT: Left the B B early... The whole place smells like no one's actually stayed there since the 90's. Also, I didn't really feel like eating breakfast with the overly excited caretaker and his I'm-going-to-steal-your-kidneys smile.

I ended up having to take the long way, since the closed road to the south actually leads to the highway. Weird thing is that when I was almost to Veneta, the road was closed on the East side too. Like all of Veneta's been closed off. GPS is jumping to random locations, so I'm going to have to try to find a way around on my own.

Before the sun came up, I kept thinking I was seeing kids on the side of the road, but as soon as I would look at them, they weren't there. I just stopped to write this update when I thought I saw a little girl behind me in my rear-view mirror. Creepy day today.

[They Tried to Kill Me](http://goo.gl/luAfwb)

[Update](http://goo.gl/tzrLPP) 




 My mother is dead.

Dead people can't hurt you.

I keep telling myself this.

Yesterday, I arrived back in my home state of Oregon. Early this morning I drove from Portland back to my hometown. 

I'm from a small town - one of the many fishing and logging towns on the gray coast. Towns that grew like ripe fruit, healthy and strong from the surplus of jobs and profits reaped from the beautiful surroundings. Eventually, when the fish were hunted to the brink of extinction and the logging industry was cut down at its base by new legislation, those towns rotted.  Everything was still there, from the schools, roads and businesses to the people who'd flocked there for a good job and the chance to raise a family. Only now, with the money and main industries gone, all those things shriveled, dead on the vine.

When I was ten, my parents divorced. I spent half my time with each parent, trading off every week. I basically had two houses, but I never stayed in one place long enough to feel like I had a "home." Neither parent was meant to have a child, and this was apparent in their treatment of me. After their divorce, each parent made their best attempt at pretending that nothing had ever happened.

My father was in-and-out of work constantly, and never held any one job long enough to settle down. Eventually, I think he just couldn't take it, and after school one Friday when he was supposed to pick me up, he wasn't there. I never saw him after that.

I spent the rest of my time there with my mother, who hated the responsibility of having me there. Unlike my father, she had a job and could afford to buy a small manufactured home near the lake that she loved. That house was her baby, set up just the way she'd always planned it. I wasn't part of that plan.

I slept in the "guest bedroom" and kept my clothes in a suitcase. I wasn't allowed to listen to music that could be heard outside the room or watch movies after dark. She had always been adamantly against having cable.  Things in the house had to be set back to exactly where they belonged as if I'd never touched them. On multiple occasions, when she'd had friends over, I'd been locked in my room told to never make a noise, or sent outside to the garden shed without lights or power so that her friends wouldn't have to "put up" with me.

As soon as I turned eighteen, I got the fuck out of there and never looked back.

Then last week, I found out that she'd died.

That's why I'm back. My uncle was the one who wrote to let me know. He encouraged me to come to the funeral and, he said, to collect something that was in her will. I still don't know what it is. She made it clear to me more than once that I wasn't going to get anything when she "keeled over."

The funeral isn't until next week, but I felt compelled to stay in my hometown for a while. For a long time it felt like I'd never be welcome back. It's weird, seeing how little the town has changed. All the same little shops and stores are in all the same places. At the grocery store, I saw a few people that I went to school with. Things here seem like they haven't changed at all, they've just gotten older.

My uncle owns my mother's house now. He hasn't decided if he'd rather sell it outright or rent it out as a summer home. He told me that I'm allowed to stay there as long as I'm in town. It kind of made me wonder why we weren't closer while I was living here.

After the sun went down, I drove out to her house for the first time since coming back. The feeling of driving was so strange after being gone for so long. I felt like I still remembered every corner and sign and bump in the road from before I'd left, like I'd only been gone for a weekend instead of five years.

I got to the house and pulled into the gravel driveway. Headlights illuminated the prim garden, wooden privacy fence and the brick red and white house. I left immediately.

I was so filled with anger and sadness at being back in that place that I almost couldn't stand it. I drove to the nearest grocery store and bought two six-packs of beer and a bunch of junk food.

I drank one beer in the parking lot before driving back, and another in the driveway before getting out of the car. I opened the fence, averting my eyes from the tool shed and without questioning it, took the key from the hiding place on the porch and opened the door to go inside.

The house was exactly as I'd last left it. I knew it would be. Everything in its place. I put away my food in the empty fridge and pulled out my laptop. The internet was still up. I went into the guest room and set up up on the desk there. I almost closed the door... five years ago I would have had to, but I thought better of it and left it open. No one was left to upset now...

I spent a few hours alternating between Netflix and Reddit, finished the six-pack and ate half the junk food before I felt my eyes begin sagging. 

From the living room, I thought I heard the high-pitched whine that the tube TV made when it was turned on. A couple of seconds later, the hiss of static gradually met my ears. I could see the faint light from the TV shining down the hallway.

My heart was already pounding in my chest, but I had to go over and see what was going on. Trying not to make any noise, I got up and went into the hall. I could see the TV now, the screen a million bouncing points of light. I crept toward the living room, and right before I entered it, I saw her there. My mother. Sitting on the couch I could make out her shoulders and the back of her head.

The strength went out of my legs and my chest froze, unable to even pull in a breath. I couldn't look away. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, but no lack of belief would make it disappear. It seemed that reality itself was broken.

"No!" I tried to shout, but only a faint sound came out. The static on the television, the only source of light in the room, began to pulse in rhythm, as if the sound had fallen into it like a rock into a pond. Each ripple dropped the room into almost total darkness, and the sound of the static seemed to come from all around me.

I turned back, to try to escape down the hall, but the instant I looked back, all the doors slammed shut. I looked back to the living room and I saw my mother start to turn her head to look at me. The light from the TV faded to a single point, as if someone had turned it off. Then darkness. 

The sound increased to a deafening roar, like a waterfall. It increased until I thought my ear drums might rupture, then immediately, as if it had been muted, it stopped.

In that small moment of silence, a young female voice from the darkness right behind me whispered, "Unwanted."

The sound erupted forth again, and the lights that I'd left on earlier came back blindingly bright. The television exploded, and a  huge torrent of water burst forth into the middle of the living room, full of fish and lily pads and other leaves and debris.

I sprinted for the front door, slipping across the wet carpet, ran down the steps and into my car.

I'm writing this from my phone in a hotel room. I've got no idea what the fuck that was or what to do. All I know right now, is that I can't go back to that house.

I've got exactly one piece of comfort right now. And that is that my mother is dead.

Dead people can't hurt you.

I keep telling myself this.

[Update](http://goo.gl/tzrLPP) 




 I grew up in Oregon, right on the cold, dismal edge of the Pacific Ocean. Fifteen minutes in any direction would take you to a beach, an open expanse of sand dunes, a National or State park, or one of about a dozen permanent lakes. For years, every summer we'd go to a family friend's house to use their lakefront property and their dock. Looking back it doesn't seem like much, but I can remember spending countless hours there swimming, kayaking, paddle-boarding and snorkeling.

When I was twelve years old, I refused to go again. I hated the lake, I hated that house. I had nightmares for years and never explained to anyone why it happened.

I still don't like to talk about it. Whenever I do, I feel like I can smell that lake again. People don't realize, but lakes are dirty places. Animals piss and shit and die in them, all kinds of plants rot on the surface, people dump their garbage. There's so much water that stays clear that people think that it's clean. It's not. All the lakes I've been to have a certain *smell* like they're not totally pure. 

This lake - *my* lake - slowly developed a smell like death.

That sounds dramatic. It's not like you could just sniff the air and think "That's death." No one would have gone to the lake if it had been like that. It was just a subtle thing that you caught a whiff of once and then it was gone. Maybe you looked around you for a dead fish or squirrel or something and then you forgot about it. I probably only noticed it was getting worse because on most days I was there from sun-up to sun-down.

The dock our friends owned was a simple hand-built thing that involved Styrofoam and treated two-by-fours. A few times it had come loose from the rope that held it and had drifted across the lake. It sat sandwiched between two bigger and more impressive boathouses. As you faced the lake from the shore, the boathouse on the right was freshly painted bright red and housed a small white fishing boat. A simple pulley system allowed the boat to be lifted out of the water while it was stored in the majority of the year when it wasn't being used.

We never saw inside the boathouse on the left, and we also never saw anyone use it. It was made of plywood that had once been painted dark green, though years of weather had warped the edges of the wood and it had shed about half its paint. That summer when I was twelve, it disappeared and we all assumed that it had just been torn down so that it wouldn't be such an eyesore.

That summer was the first one that I got really into snorkeling. I had explored the surface of the lake many times before in a boat, but that summer, I got to see a whole other world hidden below the surface. My friends and I caught salamanders, built things out of cinder blocks on the sandy bottom  and found everything from fishing lures and golf balls to pieces of old boats and docks from the past.

As you might have guessed, the lake was pretty small but it was frighteningly deep. Huge trees would fall into it on occasion, become waterlogged and would turn vertically with only their roots or broken bases poking above the surface. A swimmer drowned there once and even though they used scuba equipment to try to find the body, it was never recovered. At a depth of about ten feet, the water was already as cold as it was in the winter.  At about fifteen feet, it was dark enough that a thick forest of weeds were able to grow on the bottom. Beyond was just cold and darkness.

My friend and I devised a plan to use an upside-down plastic barrel full of air and a boat anchor to allow us to dive much further than we could while only holding our breaths from the surface. We'd go out to the dive spot using a surfboard, then, with the barrel covering our heads and masks, we clutched the anchor and jumped off, quickly sinking to the bottom of the lake. You basically dove blind, since you had the bucket over your head. We could go far enough that the pressure would compress the air in the barrel to half its original size. All we had to do in order to surface was to release the anchor, and the barrel full of air would propel us quickly to the surface. Then we'd reel up the anchor with a rope and start again.

This was fun for us to see how far we could go, and we got pretty good at it. The only bad times were when we would land in the deep weeds, which instantly tangled around our legs and ankles. We never got seriously stuck, but it would freak you out when you were expecting to land with both feet on the sand and instead landed in the weeds.

On a successful dive, you could see about five to ten feet in any direction, and looking up, you could see the outline of the sun, and the long shadow of the surfboard.

The last time I ever dove into the lake - the last time I ever swam in open water - was when I found the remains of the neighbor's boathouse. It was the first dive of the day, and we had paddled the surfboard straight out from the dock, a bit further than we normally did. It was about 10:30 am, and the water was still slightly cold from the night before. I put on my mask and snorkel, put the bucket over my head and curled my legs around the anchor like normal. This day, my friend had brought his father's underwater flashlight, so I readied that as well as the bucket above my head and took the plunge. I remember falling a long time. *Too* long, because the pressure was pressing my mask against my face uncomfortably, and the air in the barrel was compressed to smaller than I'd ever seen it. The rope, holding the anchor pulled taut, and I almost lost my grip.

I don't believe in the little voice inside of a person that tells them the difference between right and wrong. I did, however, experience a very loud message from inside myself telling me that this was not a place I should be. It was too cold, too dark, and the pressure crushed in from all sides. It wasn't the first time I'd realized the absurdity of our little diving system, but it was the first time that it had struck me as being truly stupid. My body gave me the message loud and clear that I was an idiot, but my curiosity ultimately won out. Just a quick peek.

I lifted the barrel above my head, and got my first sight of how deep I'd come. I was suspended on the rope between a gradient of gray/green above me to only blackness below. If I could have looked at myself from the outside, I'm sure I'd have resembled a worm on a hook.

I had to let go of the barrel with one hand in order to grab the flashlight tucked into my swim trunks. The air in the bucket strained to float up, and the container tipped at a dangerous angle, but the bubble of air, being so compressed, stayed intact. I clicked on the flashlight, shining it down right in front of me.

The thin beam of harsh white light sprung into existence like a camera flash, and what I saw there...

People.

Pale faces through thick, motionless black hair staring up at me from inside the remains of that old green boathouse, flipped upside down or fallen apart. They were there, right below me.

I screamed, and dropped the flashlight at the same time as I kicked off from the anchor. The barrel started pulling me up to the surface, faster and faster. In a complete panic, I thrashed my remaining arm and legs in order to try to go faster. I had expelled all my air and I felt like this was the moment I was going to die. 

I felt sure that they were right behind me, their pale hands inches from my ankles. From one moment to the next felt like an eternity. The end of the rope fell past me. *Ten more feet.*

*Nine.*

*Eight.*

Fire in my empty lungs.

I don't remember breaking the surface. I do, however remember being on top of the surfboard, alternately breathing so hard that I couldn't cry and crying so hard that I couldn't take a breath as my friend pushed my to shore. Once I reached dry land, I left without looking back.

I felt then that it was so crazy, that I couldn't tell him, or my parents or anyone. There were people down there, not living people, but dead ones, with empty eyes, staring up at the gray, faraway surface. They must have been weighted down, or restrained. I don't remember.

What I do remember is that as the flashlight fell into the weeds, it shone on the most horrible part of all. The legs of one of these... things had been roughly sewn together to create the image of a grotesque mermaid, including a large and elegantly shaped black tail.

For a long time after that incident, I tried to pretend that it hadn't happened - that I hadn't seen what I thought. Trees, or logs, not twin female bodies. A patch of sand through the weeds... *Anything* to not have to accept a reality that that scene could exist in.

As an adult, I've had to accept it. I still see it in the dark. I can't escape it. I've realized that whoever owned the boathouse, must have been *experimenting*. The swimmer who disappeared was probably one of those victims. I don't know who the other woman might have been. Somehow, the bodies would have to have been preserved. The only evidence of decay being from the eyes, which still stare at me in my nightmares.

I'm still torn between wishing I'd investigated and learned more about it, and wishing to hell that I'd never, *ever* seen it. 





























 I never knew too much about Gary. He just never acted in a way that made me wonder about him personally. Perfectly uninteresting, I guess you could say.

I remember when I met him. Gary Sheffield; 27 years old; a Bachelor's in Business specializing in Accounting from a small university; 2 years of experience as a secretarial assistant; hobbies included hiking and photography.

Pretty ordinary, on paper at least. Gary was the first assistant I'd ever had since I started my own business. Gary was on top of things. He seemed to know the ins and outs of the business better than I did at times. He built rapport with our suppliers and customers, always seemed to know how to set up my days so that I'd feel productive but not overworked.

I loved Gary as an extension of growing my business and my dream. To me, his enthusiasm every day reflected the positivity of my own success. Maybe that's why I never got to know him. I never even asked him about the single picture of his wife he kept on his desk. Ask me on any given day, and I couldn't even have told you if she had blonde or brown hair or what she looked like. Just a person in a green sweater.

Then one day when Gary came back from taking a week off, unshaven and disheveled, I started to worry about him. His work performance tanked too. I caught him napping at his desk, which I guess was the straw that broke the camel's back. It wasn't even just Gary, I'd had a bad week - fighting with my wife and an increased workload meant that I'd been sleeping at the office more nights than not... but he didn't really deserve to be sent home. I never even asked him how he was.

After trying to call him a few times that night, I finally looked up the address he'd listed last year on his resum. 150 Halcourt Drive.
I typed the address into my phone's GPS when I got into the car. It pulled up directions for Halcourt drive, and I took off through the heavy rain. 20 minutes outside of town, I found myself on a gravel road in front of a closed iron gate. Closed, but not locked. There wasn't an intercom or bell in sight. There weren't even any lights out here.

I went inside the gate, sloshing through the deepening puddles in a grassy field, unable to see anything except for outlines of bushes and rocks in the corners of my vision. Then, about a hundred feet in front of me, I saw a small orange light coming from a single window.
I changed course and headed straight toward the small cabin, but slipped on the wet earth and caught my shoulder on a huge rock.
Some yard I thought, as I stood up, rubbing my shoulder. Finally I remembered that my phone had a light on it. As the LED lit up the rock that I'd fallen on, my breath caught in my throat.

I will never leave your side. There will never be another.

I quickly turned off the light. A tombstone. His wife's tombstone. Oh my god I thought. That poor miserable boy.

I had to go see him. I had to apologize. Whatever I could do for him... I was prepared to do it.

I walked quickly up to the cabin and knocked on the door. It wasn't latched, and the rickety door was pushed open from the single knock.

Inside was a single room with a bed, a toilet, a camera on a tripod, a girl in a green sweater chained to the floor screaming and a hundred pictures pinned to the wall - a hundred different girls in green sweaters. 



















 Hello. I own a Dell XPS 14 laptop. I don't know very much about computers... but a few weeks ago three of the function keys (F4, F5, and F6) stopped working. All the keys around them work without problem. I tried messing with it a little, updating BIOS chipset drivers, etc. and after calling Dell, I sent it in to their depot for maintenance.

They said that the spill sensors had been tripped and that I'd have to replace the motherboard for half of what I paid for the computer in the first place!

**TL;DR, My question is:** How do I know for sure whether it's actually the motherboard or just the keyboard that went bad? Obviously money is a bit of an issue. (Isn't it for everyone?)

Thanks in advance!

 At work we had an air compressor and hose set up like in the picture [here](http://imgur.com/UIs0nhH.jpg).

At the end of the hose is a partially open valve. The gauge on that valve is periodically calibrated. The gauge built into the air compressor is not regularly calibrated.

The gauge on the air compressor *always* reads higher than the gauge on the end of the hose, no matter what position the shutoff valve is in. There are no obvious leaks in the hose assembly or air compressor.

#1 says that there is never a perfectly sealed system, and because of that, pressure from the compressor leaks out between the gauges and doesn't transfer all the way to the second one.

#2 says that pressure must press out constantly in all directions (Pascal's Law) and that the gauge at the compressor must be off by some amount.

It's on!

EDIT: So the situation is this: Person #1 is running the air compressor and reading that gauge, and 30 feet away Person #2 is manning the shutoff valve and reading the gauge there. There needs to be 75 psi at the end of the hose for what we need it to do. Person #1 cranks up the air compressor to 75 psig, but on #2's gauge it only reads 50 psig. For safety, neither of us wants to exceed, say, 100 psi on the hose. #2 says the gauge is wrong, and that #1 is only actually dialing the compressor up to ~50 psi, but person #1 says that both gauges are accurate and to get 75 psig at the shutoff valve, you would have to exceed the 100 psi limit.
