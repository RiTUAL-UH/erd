 I've always wanted to play it. 














 Hey everyone, instead of *just* downvoting a post could you please add a comment as to why? Maybe it's not that healthy, maybe it's not that cheap. Give us some context! Only you can improve quality and that starts with not just a downvote, but a reason as well. I'd like to know how to improve the subreddit. 
























 CAN WE PUT THE FUCKING NAME OF THE GAME IN THE GODDAMN TITLE FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!? 












































 Hello,

I just switched from an iPhone 4 to an iPhone 5 a couple of days ago. I've been having issues logging into the app. I have cleared the login sharing and cache, deleted my account and then re added it with no luck. I've even tried uninstalling then reinstalling the app. Any ideas?

 So I bought a couple of bags of fresh cranberries at the market yesterday. I get home, pop some in my mouth and almost hurled at the taste of the wretched things. They were so tart! I had no idea! 

Anyhow, I want to make something healthy with them (low in carbs) and was looking for some recipes. 

Thank you in advance. 




 Everytime I buy a certain cheese flavored chip, I am always curious as to the addition of MSG. I know it's supposed to make food taste better but I've never had that chip without it. 

Same goes for any product you've tried that was MSG free.  














 Look, I've tried donotcall.gov, I've tried being nice and telling them to please remove my number from their list. But they're adapting... Like this:

I'll get calls from numbers all over the country, when I pick up they hang up on me. I would ignore them but if I don't pick up they'll call me 4-5 times a day. Just yesterday I picked up and didn't say anything and I could hear a guy speaking Farsi. As soon as I said hello he hung up on me. If I call them back then it'll take me to a rep and when I ask them to remove me from their list they just hang up on me. 

I would love to scare the shit out of them or take legal action. It kinda freaks me out when I answer and get hung up on. Can anyone help me?

**Now the problem:**    

Just recently (within the last week) I would turn my PC on and it would load to the login screen. After I entering the password it would load the desktop and after about 10 seconds my mouse would freeze, my keyboard would be unresponsive and then the video would cut out. Every now and then after doing this my PC would restart but would meet the same doom. **This is a list of the things I tried to fix it:**  


* Draining the power after the PSU is unplugged  
* Reseating the RAM  
* Reseating the GPU  
* Resetting the BIOS (by removing the little round battery)  
* [Following these directions to make sure I'm not a crazy person](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/261145-31-perform-steps-posting-post-boot-video-problems)  

Anyhow, it's a new build (been working fine for about 4 months). 








































































































 You people loved the shit out of "Let Nas Down" by J. Cole. I love that shit too. I love the shit out of it. But all be damned. I post a link to NAS' FUCKING RESPONSE and you look the other way? J COLE WAS INSPIRED BY NAS (you'd know that by listening to "Let Nas Down") because Nas is a lyrical master. When J. Cole made that first album and became a bubble gum rapper, NAS SAID "Hey man! What the fuck!? You're better than that shit dude."  

J. Cole was obviously upset that his idol criticized him so he poured his heart and soul into [Born Sinner](http://open.spotify.com/album/1NfrmcXk8xNennyxQ57JcW) and especially that one fucking song you people liked ([Let Nas Down](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLF39513uwM)).

Well guess the fuck what? Nas heard the damn song, took the beat and intro and made a fucking response out of it. JESUS CHRIST. IS THAT NOT THE MOST BADASS THING YOU'VE EVER FUCKING HEARD? I'm not going to spoil the damn song for you all. It's worth a listen. 

"But but... it's rap" -asshole 
"Shut the fuck up and open your damn mind fool" - me  

"But it's 3 minutes long." -asshole
"Are you fucking kidding me? You spend more than three minutes jerking off getting the same euphoria that this 3 minutes will bring your bitch ass." - me  

"But your words... they hurt my feelings." -asshole
"Grow the fuck up you little bitch. Life hurts. Cry a river, build a bridge, get the fuck over it and listen to the goddamn song or so help me I will find you and implant a goddamn chip into your head that loops 'Banana Phone' into your mind nonstop. The only thing that'll make it stop is you getting over your hypocritical mentality and listening to the goddamn song." - me


[LISTEN TO IT SHIT FUCK CHRIST CROSS BITCH NIGGA.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgcAPrmz4zg)  

And if you've already listened to it and are like "Dude, chill the fuck out. I loved that shit too." then good for you. Let's eat crumpets some time. 


Also, discuss your thoughts on both songs. 

















































 Any page I load on reddit has my link karma but is missing my comment karma. This is coupled with the inability to view pictures on the page (via the picture plus sign clickable). Is something wrong on my side?

 I'm taking care of watering duties for a friend of mine while he is out of the country. I'm having some trouble with a couple of trees and plants. I water them everyday and I can't tell if I'm giving them too much. 









 I saw a post last week on /r/foodhacks about beef hearts. Turns out they're pretty cheap and can be compared to steaks. The only problem is that I live in a small town north of Dallas, Texas. I don't mind driving a fair distance to acquire it but I just don't know where to go! I went by an Asian market in Plano, TX with no luck (I thought for sure they'd have it). Can anyone offer any suggestions? 






















































 Maybe saving someone from being raped, robbed, murdered, scammed, etc. Or maybe catching a crook. You might have just frozen up, failed to react in time, or someone else stopped you from acting.

 Have any of you tried one? Could you explain the flavor? Where were you? How can an American get one? I want to know it all.
