 Go find the best free games on steam and try playing through them. Or you could try reading a heavily involved book, such as War and Peace. 




 Rome- Seat of the Roman Empire, seat of the Papacy and center of ancient and medieval Europe.

London- Second city (after Rome) to reach one million people.

Jerusalem- The thousands of years of warfare and religious intrigue surrounding this ancient city are more than enough reason.

New York- A hub of international trade almost since the discovery of the New World, and currently the seat of the UN.

Athens- Less so for being an important city and more so for the scholars it produced, namely Aristotle, Plato and Socrates. 




 Contrary to other comments, I think the US might have a bit of a fresh outlook on world policy and internal issues such as states rights.
 




 A terrifying place filled with things like "stalls" and "feminine hygiene products". 




 Toy money at the dollar store. 




 No. We live in a man's world. 




 Running into one another hundreds of miles away after being separated for years and still finding that same spark. 




 Dishwashing; I'm currently in school for economics and I want to make the jump into the business world. 




 Arn: The Knight Templar 




 Blacking out at my own party and having a "friend" of my put his balls on my face. 




 Honestly, your best bet is probably to get and audio book or two. It makes the time fly. My personal recommendation, as far as audio books are concerned, would be World War Z due to its novel method of presentation. 




 An amazon box

 I think it could because of the amazing story behind it. It's kind of hard to go wrong with such a firm footing. Even if it weren't what we are all expecting, people would change their expectations just because it's predecessors have left us with such indelible memories and the recollections of grand adventures. Particularly the opening scenes of HL2  









 It looks like the title on the subreddit is in that font so maybe you should ask one of the mods. Hope this helps. 




 Try playing a Nord Spell-sword (magic and melee). I thought it was rewarding.
 




 Roland Deschain, from Stephen King's Dark Tower series.
 




 It was really a war between bad guys.
 




 I, Robot revisited? 




 A Song of Ice and Fire total war would work pretty well too, but I doubt they would be able to get the rights.
 




 Honestly, if you want an emotional roller coaster ride and want an amazing story as well, read the "Dark Tower" series by Stephen King. Make sure you also find some room for "The Wind Through the Keyhole" too. 




 Maybe that's why GM is in such deep shit all the time.
