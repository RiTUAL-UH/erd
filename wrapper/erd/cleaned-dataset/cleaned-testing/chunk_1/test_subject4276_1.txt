 As a part of my get healthy plan, I'm quitting soda completely for a month (I'm only assuming that's how long it will take for me to not crave it, but really I want to quit until it's not something I want to drink every day) and then after that I'm limiting myself to one, per week MAX, whether it's at home, out and about, or at a restaurant. Otherwise my drink of choice is water.

Over the last few months I let myself go and I pretty much stopped taking care of myself and drank a LOT of soda. Before I was always good at drinking it only in moderation but now every time I drink it I just feel like a fat unhealthy piece of crap. So no more soda!

What are some other healthy drinks I can have? I have a hard time trusting anything from a grocery store...everything is loaded with sugars nowadays... 




 I play WordFeud with my wife because it's something that doesn't really require a huge time investment and we can be going about our daily lives and get notified when it's our turn. then I thought, how cool would it be to have a turn based game similar to Final Fantasy I can play but be able to take a turn and then go about my business. Does such a thing exist? 




 Today I went to the dentist for the first time in 2 years. I got married 2 years ago and up until a year ago I didnt know I could still be on my parents insurance. After that I just kept forgetting to make an appointment. I hardly ever brushed or flossed my teeth but today the dentist informed me I have no cavities. He seemed frustrated because of my lack of dental hygiene and yet my teeth were perfectly fine?

What about you Reddit? 









 And I ended up using every single cable 




 Or did they for some reason remove the option to turn that off from swifkey x? 

If so that's annoying because I always end up typing too fast and delete words while I type. 














 When you click on a link to imgur, if it isn't a link to an album, and it isn't a direct link to the image, I wish that the app would load the direct link instead. Landing on imgur's site on my phone gets annoying a lot. 









 For me it's the light and fan switch in my bathroom. They are swapped. The fan switch is closest to the door and the light switch is furthest from the door. Since I spend more time in my house than anywhere else, I am now trained to flick the furthest switch to turn on the light and now when I visit friends and family I turn the fan on by instinct because I forget that everywhere else is the opposite of my bathroom. 














 He said he'd mostly be using his new PC for gaming but he also said he'd be working with things like the CryEngine 3 devkit. I know that the logical cores for hyperthreading is really only useful for encoding, but I don't know much about the CryEngine devkit. Would someone really benefit from the logical cores in the 2600k for that purpose? 



















 And why did they make the chat pad incompatible with the older style headset controllers? 

I personally find the headsets to be annoying since the volume and on/off switch have to be dangling I stead of just being attached to the controller. With the newer headsets you have to take your hand off the controller to turn the mic on or off which is incredibly frustrating and distracts from the game. If someone walks into the room and wants to talk to me in the middle of the game I can't just easily turn the mic off. 

I'd like to buy the chat pad for messaging but what's the point if I have to use one or the other? WHY MUST MICROSOFT FORSAKE ME SO? 




 I've tried setting up security on my Buffalo router but it seems like every device I own will drop and reconnect every 10 minutes or so which is really aggravating. I've never had this problem with my wifi being open though. I know I can filter approved MAC addresses but I don't want to alienate anyone who comes over with their phone or laptop and want to use my wifi. I don't want to have to find out every MAC address from people who come over, and not all of them are even tech savvy so that's not the best solution.

So now I've come to want to troll the people who are using my wifi. I don't know who's doing it because I don't interact with my neighbors too often. I thought about setting up something where they can pay $10/mo per computer they connect with that goes to my paypal, but the paranoid in me thinks they will complain to the ISP that I'm reselling their service and have them shut me down.


Another thing I thought of is to change my SSID to "I can see what you're downloading"


I messed around with some of the settings and so far, I've filtered the offending neighbor's MAC addresses so that they get a max of 1500kbps down and 100kbps up. I'm also in the process of setting up access policies for the same MAC addresses to block all p2p traffic and block websites based off of the keywords "porn" and "facebook"

What else can I do that I can chuckle myself to sleep at night?

With recent events and certain posts, I find myself wanting to scroll through and find a mod's word on the subject but not all the posts are the color they should be 




 But I'm drunk and I love the bars we have here. It's always a good time and I love going downtown at night 









 It seems like everywhere on the internet and out in the real world people always proclaim how amazing that fast food place is. I can understand liking it but anytime someone has a different opinion they are quick to attack it. Why fight over which shitty food is slightly less shitty than some other shitty food? It's all fast food, and none of it is very good. I had it for the first time last summer and honestly it didn't seem any different from any other fast food restaurant. They just have a more "efficient" way of taking orders because they have less items on the menu so people who don't know what they want don't have to stare as long. I don't understand why everyone thinks it's so amazing. I'll cook a burger on my own grill/stove any day.


**edit** Just as I expected. Don't like In 'N Out? Downvotes for you 




 So that leaves me with the only option of making home-made ranch, because let's face it, the stuff you buy at the grocery store just doesn't cut it. What home-made ranch have you made that just blew you away with its awesomeness? 




 I always tell myself I need to do this, and I need to do that, but how do I go beyond telling myself? I can never actually bring myself to do it. Every once in a while I am able to get myself to a gym and I find myself actually having a good time cycling or using the elliptical for an hour listening to my music and I enjoy myself, but despite that it's still a struggle to even get that far. I feel unhappy with my life and the minimal things I have accomplished. I feel extremely unattractive, and it doesn't help that thanks to my family's genes, all my fat accumulates in my belly, so I almost look as if I'm pregnant.


The only good thing I've felt that has happened to me in the last couple years is getting married. I love her very much and I couldn't ever possibly see myself with any other woman. Somehow she saw through any physical or mental facade I had and saw the real me. But my problem is I don't even know who I really am anymore. It is hard for me to get out of bed every morning, and if I didn't have any other obligations, I would lie in bed all day. I set multiple alarms for myself and I cancel each and every one when they go off in the morning. Even if the alarm is on the other end of the apartment. I will get up, turn it off, and go back to bed.


I eat unhealthy food and can't make myself eat things that are good for me. I feel like I'm in a cycle of self destruction and I can't get out. It's killing me from the inside but I only keep making it worse day by day. I need help, what do I do?


**edit** Thanks a ton for all the replies guys. I promise that I've read every single comment that was a reply to the post (I don't know if I'll be able to get through all the subcomments). I am indeed a very disorganized person, and people have given me links to places that can help me keep track and help me set goals for myself. The first step I am taking will be to wake up at specific times every day (save for the one or two days a week where I work until 3am). My plan will be to wake up, eat a healthy breakfast, and go to the gym. I think I'll also pay for a personal trainer so I can get some sort of workout plan since I really don't know much about the gym and when I go I just mindlessly do stuff with no direction (this will help in the goals department) 




 spoilers for anyone who hasn't finished yet (why haven't you?)


I just don't see how the "first" crew could have existed once the "second" crew decided not to open the stargate while inside the star. The only reason the first crew ever got sent back 2000 years is because they went through the stargate, so if the second crew coming through didn't go through the stargate, wouldn't the first crew not exist? 




 Every other subreddit I go to except for this one has both a link that goes back to reddit.com and then another one that goes back to the front page of the subreddit. I'm used to clicking that link to get back to the subreddit because sometimes I enter through comment replies so I have to click on the "my reddits" at the very top and then scroll to r/simcity which is a little frustrating when I don't have to do it anywhere else 









 I don't have cable TV so I had to find a stream and indeed they are airing 3rd generation Toonami. Dear god don't let this be a cruel April Fools prank 




 I can't seem to find a relevant law except in vehicles. Either it is legal or bozeman cops are extremely lax about open containers late Thursday, Friday, or Saturday nights 




 If there's one thing I don't entirely understand in SC4 is having neighbor cities. A lot of people say that the only way to really have a successful city is to have it connected to neighbor cities. I guess I just can't wrap my head around the fact that I can move one city +50 years and the other city sits dormant until I load it up. I just don't understand how that actually benefits me. 




 Looking to get some paints for my wife's birthday because she wants to get back into doing some painting. What are your favorite acrylic paints and what colors should I get? Any brand I look at I can't find "just red" or similar base colors...my wife likes to mix her own colors rather than buy tubes of pre-made colors.

 I was just waiting in line to buy a soldering iron at Radio Shack and when the old guy in front of me got up there he asked if they carried GPS blockers. When the puzzled salesman said no he asked where he could get one but the salesperson had no idea.


Do you think this was an old guy paranoid the government is tracking him every day through his cell phone's GPS? Maybe he read the stories about the FBI putting trackers on peoples' cars and he didn't want it to happen to him?

 I have a couple Renegade Ops gifts in my steam inventory and I'd like to trade for something, I don't know what though. 




 The music. Both Mass Effect 1 and 2's soundtracks have been listened to by me more than any other soundtrack, movie or game. And I'm sure that the music in the third franchise will not disappoint me. I think that they deserve my money. I know there's a whole lot of other shit going on with ME3 and EA, but I hold the value of the music very high, and as such, I will purchase the game, and I will enjoy every minute of music that is heard.


On top of that, Clint Mansell is onboard for music this time around, so it should be interesting. For those of you who don't know, he's responsible for the Requiem For A Dream soundtrack.

The only thing I have to go off of is that the original file name was "The Story" and I bet you can imagine how useful typing in "The Story song" on Google is. I'm just hoping someone else finds this song familiar because I'd like to hear more like it! It has been on my hard drive for years and I still have never heard of a source

I feel like I've looked at every single music related download on TES nexus and I still haven't found it 




 I wish I had taken a picture of the wire management before. This case has absolutely no cable management features, it was rather frustrating for a young me to get things to look nice. Having a smaller graphics card certainly helps!
[Picture of current wire management](http://i.imgur.com/NuWao.jpg)
It's not the best cable management but it is pretty much the most I can do. The only place I can hide the un-used cables is to shove them into the 5.25" slots.

[I can't believe how much smaller the 6570 is compared to my old nVidia 7800GT](http://i.imgur.com/Euvm1.jpg). It was always annoying because the power connector faced where the hard drives were and it was an extremely tight squeeze which regularly made maintenance a pain. I will never own another case where the hard drive bays face that direction again.

 Woke up out of nowhere even though I didn't get any sleep the night before. Starting to feel a bit hungover. ffuuuuuuuu

also, still drunk lol 




 What do you like to drink? What's your favorite alcohol? Do you prefer straight up shots, mixed drinks, or beer? What is your favorite drunk story? Do you drunk call, text, Reddit, or internet?

Auto correct is such a godsend while drunk!

I love fireball whiskey. I bought a whole case of it last time it was on sale. I usually drink whiskey over any alcohol. I hate beer it tastes nasty. I only drink it when I'm drunk enough that my tongue is numb so I can't taste

What do you eat while drunk? I'm quite partial to pizza!

I haven't eaten anything today so I didn't have to drink that much to get drunk! I like it that way. Less alcohol to buy. I'm at the point where my face is numb!

I don't have many stories with me being drunk because I shunned alcohol for a while. But you know what? I don't care anymore. My side job is sitting with a bus driver either Thursday, Friday, or Saturday to transport drunk people around. We usually get 70-100 people per night. That job is so easy and I'd consider myself somewhat of a pro at handling drunk people when I am sober, but I love being one of them. Its awesome when I get on the bus when I'm drunk because I dont even have to remember where I live since I'm friends with the drivers.

Thanks for reading this Reddit night crew. I love social interaction when I'm drunk despite being somewhat of an introvert. My wife and my friend and I are about to get on the bus to go downtown in 15 min 



















 Gonna throw it in my old PC with an ASUS A8n SLI Premium, AMD 4200+ X2, 2GB DDR 400. I know it's a little overkill for an HTPC but it was cheap and I had a gift code to use that was expiring soon. All I really needed was a little improved performance over my nVidia 7800GT and HDMI out with audio.

What software and hardware do you guys use for your HTPCs? I was thinking of also getting the logitech RF wireless keyboard that has the trackpad on it for $40 




 OT XI? :noes::run::greddy: 




 Now i can't get my OT fix for the night. Guess I get to browse Reddit more :/ 









 I can't seem to ever find the motivation to do anything I want to do. I just waste away and do absolutely nothing. At the end of every day I am ashamed of myself of not setting forth to accomplish the goals I set for myself and I tell myself I will do better tomorrow, and it all begins with waking up. 

I want to get around 6-7 hours of sleep, but no matter how rested I feel when I wake up, I still lie in bed, pressing snooze or even setting the alarm to a later time. I sleep until I feel tired from sleeping too much. Any plans that I had that I planned for the morning before I started my day will not get done, there is no time. I feel as though I never get out of bed unless I have an obligation to go to such as work or school. I've tried moving my alarm so it's not next to my bed, hell I've put it downstairs so I actually have to walk down the stairs to turn it off. And what do I do? I climb back in bed and sleep for another hour.

How can I convince myself that going to the gym in the morning is an obligation BEFORE I go to class? I'm overweight, out of shape, unhealthy, and eat only two-sometimes one meal a day. I want to change this. I need to wake up after 6 hours of sleep, I need to go to the gym, I need to eat healtheir, but how do I begin? 









 Everyone must either use a Bluetooth headset or a dashboard mount to talk on the phone (dashboard isn't really hands free but I'm not complaining)

Mp3 players are still allowed I guess.

 When I was a freshman in college living in the dorms, I decided one night that I wanted to go out and get some McDonalds. I had stayed up all night finishing a project and came back and slept away the afternoon and the food halls were closed by the time I woke up.

I don't usually like eating by myself at a fast food restaurant, plus I'd rather have been watching TV/sitting at the computer while eating so I got my food to go. When I got to my car I put my food on top of the car so that I could put my soft drink into my cupholder. And there's the mistake I made. The classic "order something to go, and put it on top of the car, and completely forget as you get into the car and drive off" mistake.

Of course I was completely oblivious that I was forgetting something vital to my nourishment that night as I got into my car. Not only until I got most of the way back (just outside of my parking lot) that I realized something had gone horribly wrong. But that's when I spotted it. It was a miracle, a godsend, a grand triumph. Something was flapping in the wind over the top of the spoiler on my car! Yes, you guessed it! It was my McDonalds bag of food! It slid all the way down from the top of my car, and the bulk of the weight got wedged underneath the spoiler only to have the top of the bag freely flap around.

I quickly parked my car and ran back to retrieve my spoils that I had so carelessly forgotten about in my hungry stupor. The very main reason I had left the confines of my warmly flourescent-lit room made of brick and tile. The safety of the carefully selected position of my desk. The blue glow of the lights emitting from my computer tower. Much to my surprise, the food was still very warm, and all items I had ordered were accounted for.

I rushed up the four flights of stairs to my room. Today there was a triumph. I could have lost something vital to my very identity as a human being. I devoured my meal with much vigor. The fact that it was nearly lost to the solid black rivers of transportation that we call roads made it that much more delicious. The events of tonight had truly went better than expected.

TL;DR: I put food on top of my car and left it there on accident. It got stuck under my spoiler and rode all the way home and I didn't even lose a single fry.

I was thinking about adding on another graphics card, but someone else tells me that it wouldn't be much more than a hot paperweight that costs $350 and that I should maybe invest in a full on liquid cooling system instead of the CPU cooler I currently have in the build. Any suggestions? 




 Obviously, I'm going for a gaming PC, but I also do a bit of music production and would like to do some midi orchestration.

I'm thinking I should get an SSD for the computer, and really my only requirements is that the PC have at least 16gb of RAM.

I don't need any more hard drives other than the SSD, I already have about 10tb laying around. I don't need any monitors or speakers.

Problem is, I don't even know where I should start for the build. And with black friday around the corner, I don't know what deals I should be looking for to get the most bang for my buck 




 "9-1, undefeated in conference and guess who's playing like a high school B squad? Sad day in Bozeman." 




 I recently installed the update for the appstore app and while visually the app looks great, it has been a nuisance ever since. It's all in the notifications. 

I'm fine with a notification telling me I have an update, but not allowing me to close the notification from the notification bar is just plain wrong. There's no reason why I should be forced to open the app to see that update. 

Another notification problem: the app decided to try to download an app/update even though i have it set to wifi download only. But instead of actually downloading, i had a lovely status bar in my notifications that read 0% all day long. Again, no way to close the notification and when I opened the app, it didn't even say it was downloading. 

I tried looking in the settings but i couldn't for the life of me find an option to disable notifications. I went into my Android application settings to see if I could just force close the app but even though i kept getting these notifications every hour it didn't say the app was running. That leaves my only option which is to uninstall it which I don't want to do.  




 Does anyone know how the game is going to be broadcast? We weren't able to get tickets to the game so we'd like to invite a few people to our house and watch it on our TV, but the problem is we don't have Cable TV. Just internet. Does anyone know if someone will stream the game over the internet or if it will be broadcast over the air so I can pick it up with an antenna? 
























 Some friends of mine started up a Red Power/BuildCraft combination server. Both mods work really well together. We were trying to kind of keep the spirit of minecraft but have some improved redstone stuff and basically endgame material. We didn't add IndustrialCraft because it just seems like way too much.

Anyone else use these mods? Have any cool builds you did? Unfortunately I don't have anything to share because it takes a while to get up and running! Though the high amount of gems you can use for pickaxes help a lot! that way you can leave diamonds for pipes and gears 




 I really think that something needs to be done about experience orbs. When a player dies in SMP it creates way too many floating entities. I just died on a server from a creeper and all the experience orbs just about crashed the server. I had to lag my way slowly over to where the orbs were and sit there for a whole two minutes so that I could pick up what felt like half a million experience orbs. Stuff like this CAN'T be good for larger servers with more people online and possibly more than a few dying at the same time. I was the only one online at the time of this happening, so I can't imagine what would have happened if there were more online.


When there is a lot of experience orbs in one area, they should group together and become one to a few large orbs instead of a ton of tiny ones.


As for how hard this would be to implement? I don't really know, but *something* has to be done because it's a near game-breaking thing.



I'm not always up-to-date on my minecraft news, but has Notch ever addressed this issue? If he has could someone perhaps clue me in? 




 Rifle Hunting season opening weekend was last weekend here in Montana. I brought my phone with me, as I bring it everywhere, and as I expected, there was no service up in the mountains. I was messing around with it and much to my surprise and enjoyment, I found out that my phone doesn't have an aGPS chip/unit, it actually has a standalone one, so I was able to use GPS Essentials and plot waypoints and see how far they were from my position and all that all without needing a cell phone signal. Talk about nerdgasm! I wasn't expecting to do anything on my phone but play some offline games I had.


Now this leads to the point of this post: what apps out there are good for the outdoorsman who has no wireless signal? I found that Google Maps caches some maps (I presume the surrounding area of wherever you live, as my entire city I could zoom all the way in on in Maps, but my current position was just a blur). But I'd like to go further, is there an app where you can cache maps from google maps, or load other maps into it so I can see where I am via GPS and plot waypoints to navigate through the mountains? GPS Essentials did a lot but I'd like to take it a step further. I'd like to see maps and record where I went and see how far I traveled. For some reason the tracks function in GPS Essentials only records the distance between the starting point and the end point in a straight line, instead of distance traveled. 

Another awesome thing I could use is an app where I can load maps that show me private and public plots of land. Sometimes while driving along the road we see something but we don't always know whether the land out there is private or public. 




 The wife and I are trying to find some horror movies. We always watch the same movies year in and year out during October. It's hard for us to want to stray from those movies and spend money on something that turns out to be a gorefest. The problem for me is that the horror category groups both creepy/scary movies in with slasher flicks. We like paranormal movies, not stuff like Saw. I mean some death is fine but i just don't like movies just full of people dying gory deaths. I want something that will be haunting or make my skin crawl. 

Any suggestions?  
























 I saw that this was on the known bugs section for the minecraft wiki. But it seems that of the 3 servers I play on, only the one I play the most on is having this issue. Has anyone found a temporary fix for this? 




 I made an underground tree farm in a server I play on. I noticed that when one grew, it only had one or two leaf blocks on it. I thought that was strange so I went to walk over to it and I got stuck where leaves usually are. I logged out and in only to find that the leaves did indeed spawn with the tree...but for some reason they were invisible to me. The only way for me to see the leaves to chop down the tree is to log out and in after the tree grew 














 Usually when i drink with friends I just take a shot here or there but I barely ever get a decent buzz going. So last night was the first night in two weeks I could drink and either not have to sit at home or worry about a ride home so I said FUCK IT. I wanted to take the fast track so i drank 4 double shots of fireball whiskey before getting a ride to the bars. 

I had an awesome fucking night and I don't even know why... We barely did anything! But for some reason everything was funny and everyone was amazing. If you can't tell it was my first real time being drunk. I didn't even realizz I was drunk until someone told me I was... I kept insisting I was only tipsy. I also retained the ability to use proper Grammer while drunk texting/IMing  




 Busy night tonight being it some beer festival or whatever. Last run is gonna be a shitshow 




 This compilation of mods is super awesome. I had some trouble getting it to run without crashing but it was worth it. Millenaire is one of the best mods i've seen and i don't know how I haven't heard of it til now. 

I hope towns in 1.8 are similar to how the ones in Millenaire work or else I might be a tad bit disappointed =/ 














 It seems like every time I have somewhat of an emergency the only thing available is that emergency place that costs a ton of money just for my animal to be physically looked at. At least in Billings I have a 24 hr vet to go to. 

For being such a pet loving town, the vets sure aren't very animal friendly...  




 Not sure if there are any super serious injuries but almost the entire police force has been called down there. Cool car got fucked up and took out a fire hydrant 

It's a good thing there weren't people on that corner like there usually are or it would have expected been a real bad ordeal. Happened just now at 110 AM 




 At almost any time i look at my phone is have a notification for email. It's borderline annoying. I had to turn off sound notifications for it because I get one like every five minutes. I also get annoyed with my Led blinking whenever i'm trying to go to bed. I don't want to turn off notifications because i do like seeing when i have new mail... I just get way too many. Anyone else stuck in this predicament?  









 I looked through all the daytime routes and it doesn't appear that anything has changed unless it was too minor for me to notice. Maybe times have changed but I don't think so. The only major thing is a couple buses have a half hour service for "peak hours"

Both Upstream and Downtown start an hour earlier each night (Friday and Saturday, and Thursday, Friday, and Saturday respectively). So Downtown runs between 8PM and 3AM and Upstream runs between 9PM and 3AM. Last pickup at the bars is at 2AM. As usual Upstream runs up to campus twice within the last run. Once at 1:50 and again around 2:10 (or however long it takes to get up and drop everyone off and come back)

Downtown's route changed a bit. We do not run up to the Greyhound anymore. and we do not go past Catamount and the First Student bus depot, instead we drive right between Target and Costco. We now drop off right across the street from the side of Wal-Mart instead of by the gas station across 7th Ave. And we now drive past the Filler


Maybe one day I'll see a fellow redditor on the bus!

 I live in a college town and the city doesn't have any public transportation. Instead we have a bus system that started five years ago that is mostly paid for by tuition and the whole operation is ran by students, aside from the drivers and bus maintenance ... That is contracted out to a company. 

Every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday there is a bus that runs from 8 to 3am.  Our last run is when the bars close and everyone is drunk and needs a ride home. I keep them under control and make sure no fights break out and take the necessary actions if an incident does occur. I've never had anything I've had to call the cops for though... I've had relatively good luck and haven't had too many rowdy crowds. Once we fit 100 people on a bus that seats 23 to go to a hockey game 

I have about an hour to the last run right now and usually this run is pretty quiet so AMA 









 I was just wondering if anyone else uses an app on an android device for a HTPC.  

First i found teamviewer which is awesome for remote desktop which could be useful to me in the future for troubleshooting and also i thought it was damn cool that i could connect to my laptop over 3g to track progress on a download. After this i got the idea that i could use the app as a sort of remote when i connect my laptop to the tv to watch videos instead of having to either get up and lay on the floor to navigate or pill out mt keyboard and mouse and use that on the coffee table. It worked well,  however whenever i would disconnect the application would pop up with a message saying thanks and whatnot. I didnt want to stay connected with the phone for obvious reasons so this didn't work too well. 

Then i came across remotedroid which was awesome. Works like a trackpad + keyboard over wifi.. You just start an application on the computer and connect via ip with the phone app. However it gets glitchy every once in a while and i cant seem to get rid of the keyboard without disconnecting from the laptop. The other problem is that i occasionally have to ctrl + scroll up to increase text size on websites to read on my tv from the couch... And that is not possible with this app. 

So now I'm wondering... Is there any better apps out there that r/Android can recommend to me?  




 Not sure where to go with this one...bought a whole 1.75 liter bottle of Jack Daniels and want to make some barbecue sauce...anyone have recipes?

My cat got a little too playful last night and bit me pretty hard... For some reason this particular tooth mark is really bad... The others are fine. But this. One has been hurting and swollen since the moment he but me. It's difficult to move my wrist as there is a sharp pain every time i try to use my hand. I asked someone at a pharmacy and he said most likely some neosporin will help it but that was hours ago and it still is swollen and still hurts... 


So... Should I see a doctor?  




 I've been busy this summer with travelling and work and recently I've been getting the urges to start a new Minecraft world....but my only problem is knowing that there is going to be a pretty big update...and I don't want to start a new world now only to have to start another new one when the adventure update comes out...anyone else have this problem? 









 I keep seeing the same few people posting up here.  It would be nice to have a few more people up here so we can discuss local happenings! Also when is a bozeman reddit meet gonna happen? We should start throwing some ideas out there for meetup activities as well. 

Here's a couple:

Bars (obviously... But from another post I read not all of us are of age) 

Music on main? 

Follow the Pigsty and hang out where they are lol

Hike to the M

Floating the Madison 

Fishing trip?  




 The bozeman guide to drinking post said that montana spirits and wine was the cheapest... Can anyone else confirm this?  




 I saw them the first week they started up but my schedule didn't seem to meet up with when they'd be out.  Finally got a chance tonight at the reopening of the Rocking Real Bar. It was definitely some good bbq.  Cole slaw on the sandwich and all! I highly recommend to try it out if you like bbq. I'm hoping that this isn't the last food truck that Bozeman will see. I was in California for a couple weeks this month and the food trucks there were awesome and i'm glad it's spreading elsewhere. 

If you want to check out their site its at www.pigstymobilebbq.com
Follow them on facebook and twitter to find out where they will be!  









 I'm driving from Montana to California tomorrow. This is my first road trip I've ever taken. What things should I bring that could be useful or potentially life-saving?

Android appa are welcome as well! 














 When I receive a new MMS with either music or a picture in it, when i view the picture and then press the back button to go back to my inbox, the screen turns white for a second and then goes back to the picture/song. The only way to get out of this is to press the home button..any idea what's up? 







































 If people come to your door selling magazines in order to go on a trip, and they look around 25 years old and talk about "points". Call the police immediately and tell them the direction they went in. Do not let them come into your house to fill out forms under any circumstance. I managed to get my entire wallet stolen with lots of personal information. I've just spent the last 2 or 3 hours cancelling my cards and talking to the police. They mentioned being in Billings so it seems that they are moving West. I'm hoping that by posting this I can make more people aware and hopefully I'll be able to get my wallet back because it's long gone once they leave Bozeman.


*EDIT* I found a site with pictures of the people going door to door:

This one is specifically the one that came to my door:

 I'm trying to get a bunch of raw materials so I'm doing some strip mining but I'm finding that it's an incredible pain because I'm interrupted by baddies every 30 seconds that spawn off-screen. I guess lighting the place up doesn't help, I've been placing torches every 6 blocks, horizontally and vertically. I'm starting to think that right now my best option is to create vertical walls that are just under the width of the screen so that they can't come bother me while I'm working 














 I was recently talking to someone about spaceship design and we discussed how 99% of all games/tv shows/movies don't portray ship movement right and suddenly I had a moment of nostalgia and remembered that demo of that awesome game that never really got released from so long ago. Nexus was still good but it never lived up to what IG3 was supposed to be and the gameplay felt kindof shallow compared to how complex IG3 was. And if you ask me, even when the demo came out, the game was way ahead of its time, especially in the regard to particle effects

I'm just wondering if anyone else gets in the same nostalgia boat that I'm in whenever I think about this game. It's the same one where we mourn great games that never got to see the light of day. (though this one in some form sortof did). I just tried to install the demo and play it again for old time's sake but alas, the installer won't work on Windows 7 =\
