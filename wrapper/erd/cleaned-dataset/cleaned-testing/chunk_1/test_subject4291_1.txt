 Within reason of course (i.e. there's a legitimate issue) 




 I grew up bilingual. So grateful. Definitely gonna raise any kids I may have speaking 2 or more languages. 
























 I definitely prefer Chii's rendition. In general I don't like a lot of KPP's music, save for a few songs. "Fun" is a good word to describe her music in general, in my opinion.  




 You've given us quite the taxing challenge. How about "Washing"? Could you afford us more characters? This really constitutes a problem...

Sorry I don't have anything better :(

Any redditors want to aid me in supporting her dream?! 




 Is it better to play someone old, that you've played many times and has had quite an impact on your life, or to play something you haven't played, but you know the franchise, the mechanics, the rough story line etc? Is the (relativity small) novel experience more valuable than the nostalgic experience? 




 I feel like I should know this, but what's that from?

 Man, what kind of birthday songs are your friends and family into? That sounds messed up. 




 They will look up and ask "Tell us about Bryson" and I will whisper "no".
 




 This had bugged me for some time, being a Belgian studying in America. I grew up speaking Dutch and French, so whenever an American pronounces a typical Dutch/French word incorrectly, it gets under my skin. 
One recent example is my professors pronunciation of 'apartheid'. In Afrikaans or Dutch it should be pronounced something like 'apart hide', but my profs use the American 'th' pronunciation in the word.

Am I in the wrong here? If no, what are foreign words that get mispronounced that really bug you? 









 Tough project. You may want to start with a clean slate.
