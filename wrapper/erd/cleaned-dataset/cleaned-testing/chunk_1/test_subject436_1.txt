 It actually blows my mind that America was ever close to Pakistan. Popular sentiment in India is probably very pro-American, but is the opposite for large parts of Pakistan. 




 China is slowly repositioning its economy as it looks like its going for a soft landing -- no way in hell the leaders there will let Russia fuck with its plans. Not only that, but the only friendly connection to Russia is historical. They would lose almost all political support with the world if they sided with Russia. China really wants to prove that it can be a proper world power, not one that is isolated from everyone else. Not only that, but popular sentiment is pro-American. 




 In that case doesn't that count as attempted murder? 




 At least some part of the Ukraine government knows how to play the long game. Regardless of the short term consequences, Putin has most definitely lost. In the medium to long term most European and former Soviet countries are thinking twice about dealing with Russia. Expect new oil and gas agreements to start popping up. You have massive wealth loss in Russia. You're starting to get protests in Moscow too. There is no way in which Russia comes out of this crisis in better shape than when it entered, even if it annexed all of Ukraine. When the only people on your side are Syria and Iran, and the people on the fence are having second thoughts, then the geopolitical game will finish you off. It's what happened in the 80s when the USSR finally collapsed (when Middle Eastern oil made short work of the Russian economy), and it will happen again if Putin continues to put his short term pride over long term prudence. 




 Nokia too. AFAIK there was also some kind of weird tax break and they actually bought the company out at a huge discount after the first announced price. 




 I've mentioned this in a few threads now, but wanted to point it out again: this plane was communicating with the satellite for much longer than anyone thought. Wasn't it supposed to land at 8:30am in Beijing that day? It was still pinging when it was supposed to be in China airspace! The fact that it can fly for six hours without anyone noticing blows my mind. 




 Look at that quote: "According to the new data, the last confirmed communication between the plane and the satellite was at 8.11am (Malay time) Saturday 8th March." That thing was in the air for a *long time*. AFAIK, it might have still been communicating with the satellite when it was supposed to land in Beijing! AFAIK the transponder signal was flipped off at ~1-2am, which means this thing was in the air for a solid 6 hours without anyone noticing. 




 Man, this guy is slower than Shatner.

Edit: Holy fuck, this guy just said it was still communicating with the satellite at 8am. 




 It could be that something went wrong for the hijackers and they were dumb enough to not have a backup plan. So they tried to fly it somewhere else and ran out of fuel. 




 No kidding. For the sake of comparison, my friends who did not graduate from a top-tier law school are having problems getting by while paying off their loans. Not to mention some of them who graduated without offers were pretty much completely fucked. 




 The problem is making those student loan payments with a "small" job. There are many people who come out of law school without offers from a firm, and barely scrape by trying to make payments. 




 It is antagonistic and stupid when all it takes is a simple 5 second google search for "Glyphosate". Some people refuse to be open minded and just yell out "source?" when they in fact are just too lazy to do their own research. 




 I wouldn't be worried about them dropping Drive, but Google has a track record recently of limiting integration with other services. 




 Have you tried fetching data from it though? I've had friends who tried to do a restore and they said it was really slow. 




 The problem is with zoning laws. Unless you are living way out there, it is unfortunately very difficult to get a development made out of shipping containers even if you are in the suburbs. 




 What is the endgame there? Let's say there was an actual hostage/ransom negotiation that the Malaysian government was involved in. The longer they keep this from the public, the worse they will look in the end. 




 With regards to #2, it's really hard to land a plane anywhere in that part of the world without anyone noticing. It's one of the most populated regions on the planet. 




 Yes, but I don't think shooting at a tweaked out road rager would be a good idea. Unless you're a professional and can take him out with the few bullets that you have, I think you'd just enrage the driver more and get run over. 




 I'd get one for the rear view too! 




 We try to communicate with these animals because they're at least genetically similar enough to share some behavioral traits. We're genetically 70% identical to zebrafish, and much closer to the animals you mentioned. Given the fact that life likely started at completely disparate times in the Universe, it's likely that the genetic/"functional" difference between any extraterrestial and us would be like how we look at E. coli. 




 Your mortgage is my monthly rent for a 1 bedroom apartment in the Bay Area.... :( 




 I played up to a few levels into the Arson stage. The game is just incredibly repetitive, with interrogation options that make no sense. Gunfights were a total joke too. The voice acting is pretty decent, but the plot was basically going slower than molasses.  




 Inland crash would come with fire and smoke, which would be easy to spot  by air or satellite. 




 I think it's more useful to look at effect size, in conjunction with p-value. This is a "non-drug" based approach to cancer therapy, with a good number of patients achieving remission. That kind of change in survival is practically unheard of for 99% of cancer drugs in Phase 1. 




 Not to be too much of an optimist here, but even for a Phase 1 trial full remission is nothing to sneeze at. That's a gigantic effect size, considering that most drugs only extend survival by months to at most a year. I haven't read the full details of this trial (or much about it in the literature), but if we can get cancer immunotherapy to work on solid tumors then it is definitely game changing. 




 I second that. Dry ice can last a long time in a covered (not sealed) styrofoam container! 




 What about used lab equipment on places like LabX or laboratory surplus stores? 




 Man, there are tons of Canadian racists in this sub-thread. Kind of shocking. I grew up in Alberta so I thought I've seen everything too. 




 By and large first-generation immigrants (especially labor or service work) do not mix well. These are the ones who come to Canada to primarily have a better life for their children. Canadian children born to immigrant parents generally do much better at integration, end up being well-educated, and have much better economic outcomes compared to their parents. 




 I'm a Canadian living in the USA for the past 8 years.

Let's be fair here: when stratifying by ethnic groups, standards of living in Canada are by and large **much** better than the USA. It's not even a fair contest. Crime rates in Canada are downright laughable compared to the USA. It is true that jobs are segregated across racial lines but that is changing a lot as the children of immigrants get out of college, start second-generation families, and compete with white folk for top-tier jobs. 




 With respect to the first point: how do you think the World Cup is going to be? I was a little apprehensive when they had it in South Africa but that ended up being pretty much okay. 




 My current girlfriend always compliments on my "bone structure". She was talking about my face and not my penis, but to this day I don't really know what she means. 




 I asked my girlfriend recently about whether she likes forearms and she said "What? No, that sounds ridiculous." Not sure if it's as common as the internet makes it out to be... 




 Not to mention that in many European countries, children are "tiered off" at an early age into brackets that determine your future career. Movement between these tiers is extremely hard. But in this way you game the "Math and Sciences" exams because the students who take them are already selected to be smart. 




 Can you use this to install Google apps such as Hangouts? I desperately depend on a hardware qwerty but I use Hangouts a lot to chat. 




 To be fair, not all of us who favor intervention are in favor of military action. There are a lot of steps to go before you send in soldiers. Fundamentally I think the notion that another country's problems are not our owns is somewhat racist. It's like saying their own problems are not worth addressing. There are non-profit programs all over the world that work in health and education and people support the development of these infrastructures, but as soon as civil strife and violence comes in everybody throws their hands up and says "not our problem" when civil society is one of the most important aspects of ensuring day-to-day stability. It's like saying that these other countries aren't "good enough" or "civilized enough" to join the world society at large. 




 It's ridiculous, really. We expect college students to be able to plan out their lives in **freshman/sophomore** year and criticize them for choosing the "wrong" major, but we pretty much give every adult a pass when they have to make the same choice. 




 No way, China knows not to fuck with the US. Going SE into Asia is a bad idea when there is a SK/NK conflict going on, because that would mean a two-pronged war at their doorstep. Three-pronged, if Japan decides to jump in for fun. 




 Let's be fair here -- they removed Russian as an official language in the East on the first day of the "new" parliament, which prompted massive protests. Many cabinet members in the current government were part of a far-right nationalist party as well. The ethnic tensions go **both** ways. 




 How do medical professionals protect themselves from this kind of thing on a daily basis? Do doctors and nurses get sick more often compared to the general population? 




 Palo Alto is a disaster in the summer time. There's no central AC anywhere and apartments boil. 




 Too late, some aspiring screenwriter probably saw this and is writing a script now. 




 I think this is great news, and validates a few things: (1) viral load is a pretty good predictor of infectiousness, (2) basic molecular biology models of the disease hold up: if you have low levels of the virus, you're not going to infect another person, (3) heterosexual couples where the male is HIV+ could easily bear children who are HIV-, and (4) if this study were expanded to more people and longer time points, ART could essentially eradicate HIV over time regardless if couples have sex with or without condoms. HIV+ patients could possibly lead even more normal lives than previously thought. 




 Also easier to reduce tax breaks for gains from real estate, or heavily tax people who own multiple houses (not multi-unit apartments) with high net worth. 




 Perfect example: the Philippines. I think I saw an article about how a naval ship was using the power plant on board to generate fresh water for people. 




 A coffee maker is too inconvenient, and the water doesn't get hot enough to extract nice flavors. Here's an easier method:

1. https://shoponline.melitta.com/items/COFFMKRSPROVER
2. Boil water
3. 3 Tbsp of coffee
4. Pour hot water onto grounds. If you are really fancy you could pour at a constant rate like those hipsters do. I just fill it to the top because I don't care.
5. Drink. Throw away filter.

 




 If people start starving like in Soviet times, they will most definitely revolt against him -- that time wasn't so long ago.

Edit: not to mention that the internet makes a lot of propaganda completely useless, especially in the big cities that matter (eg. St. Petersburg and Moscow). 




 So, if an eagle decides to fuck you up, what's the second person gonna do? I'm pretty sure that it'll still end badly. 





























 I'm looking for one to do microfluidic mold prototyping, as it looks like the cost and turnaround time would blow current methods out of the water. The only issue is that a lot of 3D printers have poor resolution. I'd like to use one that has resolution in the 10-100 micron range. Are there any in the market that can do that? The height of the layers should be in the same range too. Price isn't really an issue, but I'm hoping for 10k if that's possible.

Edit: price is not really a concern -- it's going into a grant application anyway so other things can be budgeted accordingly. 









 Obama is eager to fly drones and do airstrikes in an easily radicalized region and provoking extremist groups, but doesn't want to touch a region that only "has a potential" for future radicalization. I'm not saying he should bomb or invade Syria, but Obama doesn't seem to be interested in anything beyond waving a finger in their direction. There is a lot of room for diplomatic work but we haven't seen anything substantial for the past two years. What gives? 
























 Here's my favorite: not practicing proper hygiene in order to "train the immune system". That's not how it works... 



















 The Pathogenic Role of Intestinal Flora in IBD and Colon Cancer
Author: Rescigno, Maria
Source: Current Drug Targets, Volume 9, Number 5, May 2008 , pp. 395-403(9)

http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cdt/2008/00000009/00000005/art00007

The intestine is populated by a large variety of microorganisms that colonize the host soon after birth. The gut microflora contributes to several intestinal functions, including the development of the mucosal immune system, the absorption of complex macromolecules, the synthesis of aminoacids and vitamins and the protection against pathogenic microorganisms. Its composition varies along the different segments of the gut, with a gradient from the stomach to the colon where it is more abundant. Given the vital relationship between the microflora and the intestinal function, it is important that the microflora is kept continuously under control so to preserve gut homeostasis. When this is not achieved or perturbed, several immune disorders can arise, like allergies or inflammation. Protracted immune deregulations can also lead to severe disorders including diabetes, cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is therefore crucial that the immune system learns both to tolerate and to control the growth of beneficial microorganisms so to preserve the intestinal homeostasis. The mechanisms that are in place to achieve this control are not yet understood but recent work has started to unravel the complex relationship between several players including the microflora, intestinal barriers and immune cells. In this review we will analyze how the microflora interacts with the host and how deregulation of this interaction can lead to inflammatory disorders and eventually also to cancer. 




 I eat at least 2-3 cups of cereal for breakfast, so I tend to go through a box every 3 or 4 days. I typically eat the healthy kind too (eg. multi whole grain flakes) so it's become a non-trivial cost. Does anyone have a good recipe for homemade cereal flakes? I'm not a big fan of granola (scratches my mouth too much), and the recipes that I've found online look like blogspam or haven't had much of a discussion about taste/quality. 




 Honestly, I'm pretty good at cleaning a room but the thought of dusting something has never occurred to me. She mentioned something about some kind of spray and a towel? What am I supposed to be wiping? And the fan in my room is absolutely caked in dust -- how do I clean that without spreading dust everywhere? Also, my down duvet spreads little feathers everywhere and I don't have a good way of wiping those off surfaces.

TL;DR - Girlfriend wants me to wipe down my room and I don't know how. Not a euphemism! 




 I'm going to be buying a new notebook pretty soon, and I'm torn between getting a beefy one with a decent graphics card versus an ultrabook/ultraportable. Most of my time is actually spent doing academic work and doesn't require much graphics muscle, but from time to time I like to play the occasional video game. I'm also pretty tired of turning my graphics to low and 800x600 resolution just to get a playable framerate.

Enter Onlive. Can I use this with a decent academic internet connection, and will it play nice with integrated graphics? I'm also worried about any latency issues too. The great thing about it is that I can play pretty much any game I want without worrying about system requirements. The problem is that I haven't read many recent reviews since its initial release nor have I read many anecdotes about whether the service is any good... 




 Fabrication of polypyrrole micropatterns through microchannel-confined electropolymerization and their electrical conductivities  

Electrochimica Acta, Volume 54, Issue 17, 1 July 2009 , Pages 4253-4257

"Creating micropatterns of electrically conductive polymers on solid substrates is important for the low-cost construction of organic microelectronic devices. This work develops a novel strategy for the preparation of large-area polypyrrole (Ppy) micropatterns through area-selected in situ electropolymerization of pyrrole within microchannels. The effects on micropattern formation of electropolymerization procedures such as dynamic potential polymerization (DPP), static potential polymerization (SPP), and constant current polymerization (CCP), the solvent, and the polymerization time were studied systematically. The electrical conductivities of the Ppy micropatterns were measured and compared with a homogeneous Ppy thin film synthesized under the same conditions. Given the straightforward and versatile nature of this method, it is expected to contribute greatly to the convenient fabrication of low-cost organic microelectronic devices."

"The adsorption of various carboxylic acids onto alumina substrates has been studied as a model system for the study of the long range hydrophobic interaction. The adsorption was studied using classical adsorption isotherms, contact angle measurements and colloid probe atomic force microscopy. Carboxylic acids form esters with the hydroxyl groups present on the alumina surface and produce surfaces with a range of hydrophobicities and stabilities depending on the acid's functionality. Hydrocarbon carboxylic acid adsorption was found to be adequately described by the Langmuir adsorption model and produced stable surfaces of varying hydrophobicities which resisted dissolution by water. By comparison, hydrophobic surfaces produced with fluorinated acids adsorbed from aqueous solution were not always stable, although their stability was greatly improved when the chemisorption was carried out in a non-aqueous solvent at elevated temperatures. Adsorption of these fluorinated carboxylic acids produced the most hydrophobic surfaces. Interaction forces between alumina surfaces coated with adsorbed propionic acid were as expected from DLVO theory with no evidence of hydrophobic forces."

 




 Way back before Ron Paul became a candidate to be taken seriously (think Election 2008 and before), he was pretty much loved by Reddit and especially on r/politics. Since then the subreddit became a little too spammy for me so I removed it from my front page, but I decided to check it out again because of the coming election. How does the community feel about him these days now that he's been given much, much more airtime to voice his platform (especially during the debates) and is being substantially less marginalized this election?  




 You know what I mean -- a protocol isn't working, and you google it online. The results are pure garbage. I would imagine that this would only be useful for grad students, which would clear out all the undergrad homework help threads. Also, I think it would be great for just general suggestions/advice for good control experiments/help with data analysis. Of course, a lot of the threads can't be too specific because of publication concerns, but I think that we can keep it solidly based on methods help. The only issue is that a subreddit like this would need lots of people.... 














 It's becoming clear that the current patchwork of deficit reduction and continual small scale stimulus isn't going to turn around the economy. Corporations are hoarding profits, maximizing productivity from their existing staff, and minimizing new hires. The United States is getting their asses kicked by globalization, especially in terms of manufacturing. It is inevitable that several industries that we take for granted in this country will cease to exist in a decade's time. If you were the President of the United States, what policies would you implement to create job growth and transform this country? 














 Some posts (like the Oslo one on the front page right now) deserve to be on the top spot for a day or two. Yet, it will fall off the front page because of the post's age. How about a separate voting scheme of whether a post stays "stickied" at the top or not, or at least a modification of up/downvotes so that a submission's lifetime is higher? 














 I haven't gone out to see the fireworks in years, and last time was at the Hatch Shell (which was an... interesting... experience). Does anyone have any protips for the holiday? Some friends and I are heading out to see the fireworks but I don't really want to head down into the Esplanade. I've heard the Longfellow and Harvard bridges are good but crowded. Is it as bad as they say or does it get better if you walk closer to the middle? Or is there somewhere else that works much better? 




 I've been thinking of setting up Sharepoint Foundation or Office 365 for my lab, so that we could collaborate on paper writing, data sharing, internal wikis, etc. We already have a wiki set up for things like lab inventory and scheduling, but currently document writing is still a huge mess where we email back and forth drafts and get confused over the version number. Office 365/Sharepoint Foundation sounds like it might be a good fit because it hooks directly into Word (some people in our lab are not so tech savvy). The only problem is that there is no way to try those out before we take the plunge (Office 365 would work out to about $100/month and the beta is ending in a day or two. To use Sharepoint Foundation we need a beefy computer and that costs some money too). Are there any alternative solutions we can try out? I've thought about using Office Web Apps for collaboration, but many of us don't have/want a Windows Live ID and Google Docs is sorely lacking. 









 Hi everyone! I'm part of a Harvard graduate student science outreach club that hosts a lecture series on current science topics. Tomorrow we're going to be hosting a seminar on the origins and applications of pluripotent stem cells. In the past two lectures we've had we had amazing attendance for topics such as sleep and black holes, so this one should be good too! Our lecturers are given by Harvard graduate students working directly in the field. Given that reddit is a pretty science-friendly crowd, I figure that I should at least give a shout to my favorite internet community. :)

The lecture is happening tomorrow, June 1st, at 7pm at the Harvard Department of Chemistry Pfizer Hall (12 Oxford St). (http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d source=embed saddr= daddr=42.377334,-71.115704 hl=en geocode= mra=mift mrsp=1 sz=18 sll=42.377758,-71.115242 sspn=0.00256,0.005681 ie=UTF8 ll=42.377758,-71.115242 spn=0.002774,0.00456 z=17 and street view at http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q source=embed hl=en geocode= q=12+Oxford+St,+Cambridge,+MA+02138 aq=0 sll=37.0625,-95.677068 sspn=44.928295,93.076172 ie=UTF8 hq= hnear=12+Oxford+St,+Cambridge,+Massachusetts+02138 layer=c cbll=42.377093,-71.115995 panoid=dTwRfBoOZfu_h3f2h-ccQQ cbp=13,24.37,,0,-6.71 ll=42.377093,-71.115995 spn=0,0.048237 z=14).

 Hey, thanks for those who did come out to the one we had two weeks ago on Black Holes (http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/h1no2/event_free_harvard_science_lecture_on_current/). We had about an attendance of 60+ people from the Boston community. This week we're going to talk about a topic that is dear to everyone's hearts: sleep. How does sleep work? What benefits does the brain gain from it? Do we need it?

As said in the other topic, in full disclosure I'm part of the organizing committee on this event and I thought it would be fun to spread this out to my favorite internet community, in which I've laid the smackdown sometimes (fine, occasionally) on r/science. It's a completely free lecture, no registration required. We're a Harvard graduate student organization dedicated to science outreach for the general public. Our website is https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/.

Event Details: May 18th at 7pm, at 12 Oxford St. (Harvard Dept of Chemistry). You have to go in the side door (http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q source=s_q hl=en geocode= q=12+Oxford+St,+Cambridge,+MA+02138 aq=0 sll=37.0625,-95.677068 sspn=44.928295,93.076172 ie=UTF8 hq= hnear=12+Oxford+St,+Cambridge,+Massachusetts+02138 ll=42.376998,-71.115961 spn=0.001286,0.00284 z=19 layer=c cbll=42.377093,-71.115995 panoid=dTwRfBoOZfu_h3f2h-ccQQ cbp=12,5.93,,0,-5.69) at the very far end of the building to the right.

Hope to see you there!! 




 Hey Redditors! We (Science in the News, a Harvard grad student science outreach organization) are hosting a spring lecture series on current science topics. The speakers are all young graduate students and the lectures are geared for general non-specialist audiences. 

The first one is on May 4th (this wednesday!) at 7pm, and is going to be on black holes. It's being held at Harvard's Department of Chemistry at 12 Oxford Street. Our website is at https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu and you can find the full details and schedule there, but I can also answer any questions. Hope to see some redditors there!

UPDATE: Hope to see some of you tomorrow! Here are the directions: https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/directions/ and the building is the one on the right hand side: http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q source=s_q hl=en geocode= q=12+Oxford+St,+Cambridge,+MA+02138 aq=0 sll=37.0625,-95.677068 sspn=44.928295,93.076172 ie=UTF8 hq= hnear=12+Oxford+St,+Cambridge,+Massachusetts+02138 ll=42.376998,-71.115961 spn=0.001286,0.00284 z=19 layer=c cbll=42.377093,-71.115995 panoid=dTwRfBoOZfu_h3f2h-ccQQ cbp=12,5.93,,0,-5.69 




 So my girlfriend (also a redditor) is looking to buy a new laptop. We agreed that it would be easier for me to post this since I can better explain her needs. 

She's looking for a laptop 14" and under that is pretty durable and can be taken around a foreign country while she does fieldwork (non-technical) on a semi-permanent basis. Basically, she is just using basic office applications and watching hulu or dvds or video chatting when she has free time. I've recommended the Lenovo T420 or T420s to her because it has a good balance of both mobility (weight and battery life) and durability. I've also considered the Macbook Pro 13 or the Macbook Air 13 but the issues with those are the poor screen resolution in the former and price of both. Because she will be doing fieldwork it would be hard to get service for it at an Apple store but Lenovo has pretty extensive worldwide support. Also, I question the value/struggle of learning a supposedly easier operating system when she has other more important academic matters to deal with. Are there any other computers that I have missed, or should I go for any of the computers that I've mentioned (Lenovo and Apple)? 




 For example, chemistry has many top-notch journals that accept one or two pagers for work that is short and sweet. Why isn't this the case in biology? I understand the need for publishing a complete story (see: Cell), but even Nature and Science publications average 3-4 pages and should really only be for your career's best work. The whole spending your whole PhD/postdoc hoping for one big publication isn't very sustainable in the long run, so why do journals keep perpetuating this problem? 




 I'm not exactly sure how this would potentially work, but for really long multi-levelled threads that stagger back and forth it's hard to see who is commenting to what. It would be nice to have a little icon on each comment that you can mouseover to see what the immediate parent is. Of course, it wouldn't be very useful to see what the parent's parent is, but it would be better than nothing. 




 Also, I plan to keep this laptop for 3-4 years. Is there any point in getting the accidental or extended warranties?

Edit: I plan to go with the business line laptops. 









 Okay, so I have practically zero experience on this kind of thing, due to a very small amount of partners in the past. But my girlfriend really loves it, and I want to make it great for her too. I'm pretty bad at it, partly because I feel that my tongue has no strength at all and that I'm not sure what/where it should be doing. It's also pretty short, compared to Caucasian tongues (I'm Asian, and yes, feel free to make all the jokes you want...). Lastly, I don't know what to do about all the hair that's there since I really have to get in there for my tongue to get any access. She keeps it trimmed but it still gets in my mouth sometimes (which I figure is unavoidable). 




 I want to get some Canadian Ice Wine for my girlfriend's family when I visit them (in Ohio) at the end of the month. Is there a place that sells it in the area? I think I would also have luck at a generic fancy wine store in the Boston area. It has to be accessible by public transit though, because I don't have a car and it's too fucking cold to walk. :( 









 I thought my entire life that this was normal, but apparently a lot of people don't suffer from this! Basically when I wake up in the morning (in addition to no cognitive abilities), I have no strength in my hands meaning that I can't even open a bottle of water if I'm thirsty. Can't grip doorknobs, etc. This also happens when I find something really funny or when I get tickled (I also get lightheaded and dizzy from tickling). Can anyone relate to my silly disorder? 




 Those World Cup fan threads have made me wonder: Eastern European women are pretty good looking but many suffer from middle age burnout. Is there an equivalent for our beautiful friends to the south? 




 For example, this reddit submission: http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/bphq8/school_sex_education_about_breast_sizes_what_you/ 




 Or would the universe just implode? 




 In a post-Bush world, I think the American public will be more resistant to these changes. Who or where should the average person go to in order to voice their concerns? Something has to be done about this bullshit theater of security. 









 Seriously. What gives?
