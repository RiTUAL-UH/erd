 Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds could be used to construct vital components for quantum computers. But hitherto it has been impossible to read optically written information from such systems electronically. Using a graphene layer, a team of scientists headed by Professor Alexander Holleitner of the Technische Universitt Mnchen (TUM) has now implemented just such a read unit. 



















 These materials are predicted to show a phenomenon called the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, and belong to a class of materials known as transition metal dichalcogenides, with layers a few atoms thick. QSH materials have the unusual property of being electrical insulators in the bulk of the material, yet highly conductive on their edges. This could potentially make them a suitable material for new kinds of quantum electronic devices. 









 Commonwealth Bank of Australia will get early access to developments made in this highly technical field, quantum computing. The centre for quantum computation and communication technology at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) aims to make the manufacture of quantum computers increasingly viable by 2018. 





























 We can continue this development towards 2017, we will put ourselves in a great position to challenge for the 2017 World Cup title 












































 The list details 400 cities, suburbs and towns across Australia where homes and businesses will be connected to the network by June 2016 - or 100,000 connections per month. 



























































 Just 18 months after launch, Synbiota Incs global network of biohackers has produced successful Synthetic Biology startups. 









 Philip Nelson, EPSRC chief executive, adds that the hubs "will draw together scientists, engineers and technologists from across the UK, who will explore how we can exploit the intriguing properties of the quantum realm". He adds that "The area offers great promise, and the hubs will keep the UK at the leading edge of this exciting field." 









 Physicist Claes-Gran Granqvist of Uppsala University in Sweden says that Fan's team has demonstrated an "interesting effect".
