 She hasn't been exsanguinated nor given Digitalis. Hopefully she'll be alright and this has nothing to do with the Eve's. 




 I'd certainly read more!  




 That's awful. I'm so sorry you had to go through that. Thanks for sharing with us, OP, and I hope things have changed for the better for you. 




 Tell your brother the truth. Tell him about the picture, the woman in the kitchen, remind him of the heavy breathing. All of it. It isn't fair for him to think he's crazy when you know the truth. 




 Thanks for clarifying that.

Can I ask though, now that it's done, have you got any clarity as to why you did it? 
 




 Is the mark in the same place your wife's cancer started? Did she lose her hair during treatment? 




 You ok OP?

 My mom does that too. 

She'd dump out my cup of freshly made tea and put the cup in the sink, then complain about how many dishes I've left, or take all my shower stuff out of the basket I have in there, and replace it with hers, then act oblivious when I ask where my stuff is. The best though is when she takes a bag of my laundry to wash with hers when I'm busy, and then SWEARS she can't find any of the items that were in that bag. Which I then find in her room. My whole life has been spent looking for my stuff she refuses to admit she moved/lost. 




 Was she.... your sister? What?  




 Nosleep = crack. Even when I want to stop, I can't. 




 I'm sad this was removed!

But on a better note, I won this game this morning! Had a hair elastic in my hand while sitting in bed, don't remember setting it down, found it underneath my pillow! 

Edit: Did you change the clock on my stove? I reset it after a power outage and the next day it was 11 minutes off.
Second edit: 3:49 am. Have lost my cellphone 3 times now, twice found in bed, once in bathroom. Bunch of Chrome tabs I don't remember opening. I promise to never notice you again. 




 North Wales Hospital right? I've read about it. Are you alright?
Did you get into the burned out bits or just the stuff where they were trying to convert it to apartments? (Stupid plan, eh?)  




 Upvoted cause my black lab named Abigail and I are seriously curious about this. 




 I... don't think so. I feel like an idiot having done this but all the randomly capitalized words ends up being: ssmrtwdmhwhhttiiattttoatfohotujoto. Which I think is nonsense. 




 What? 




 This is seriously my favorite thing on the internet. 




 Just a suggestion, please format the conversations a bit better. I want to read it but I can't follow the huge block of text. :) 




 I think something is up but I can't place exactly what it is, it's just a feeling plus Steph being M.I.A. The dog I have no explanation for. It's only when we put Jake in his room though. Not any other time.  




 No worries friend. I've got a grown man snoring on one side of me, Jake is asleep on the other side with every blanket on the bed on top of him, and the dog is on my feet. I've had to read my replies 3 or 4 times to check for typos, EVERY time. I think we may go stay at my dad's for a bit. He lives out of the city in a pretty quiet spot (thankfully with wifi.) I've got a few days off coming soon and Win has some vacation time still.  




 Hey folks. I wasn't sure where to post this but figured here was a good start. 

Suffice it to say, my son is 7 going on 8 and he has been through a traumatic event. Could this be causing him to regress in certain aspects but not others?

We practiced extended breastfeeding and he weaned at around 3.5, with the odd nightmare or stomach bug bringing him back to wanting to nurse up until about 5. He's an articulate kid so he understands why I'm  not allowing it now and he can communicate his desire although not necessarily his reasons. 

I'm just wondering if any other EBF mom out there has dealt with something similar, and what you'd suggest I do in this situation. 
Thanks in advance. 




 Ah okay I get where you were going with that. But no, poor guy just seems to have shit luck. I had one miscarriage before Jake, his next girlfriend had one and left him shortly after, and Steph's had two previous to this pregnancy.  




 Something IS off. 
I wish I could put my finger on it so I could describe how it feels here or all of /nosleep could just be here for a day to feel it. 

Like Win even brings Jake to see me when I'm working because it's this tight chest can't focus kind of desperation and general wrongness. Left over anxiety maybe? 


As for Win being involved... He has the kindest and gentlest soul I've ever met. He loves Jake and I so much and he is such a genuinely good man. I trust him as much as I trust myself. I can say with certainty that he isn't involved. His only flaw here may have been withdrawing from Steph the way he did, to be with Jake and I. 




 Not much but a small update added. 




 Tiny update added. 




 Op deleted their account, what do we do now? 




 Update us again soon Op! Stay safe. 




 If I went into my mom's room upset about knocking in the middle of the night, she'd tell me it was gas and yell at me for waking her up. Stuff like this is like 90% of the reason I got a dog.  




 Your writing is beautiful OP. I'll be checking for updates! 




 Oh. My. God. I was picturing Animal from the Muppets the whole time I was reading. Lol. 




 I was picturing Animal from The Muppets. 




 I haven't got much reason to suspect her but I feel the same way. What if A: She was involved or B: Something happened to her. But at the same time, she told Win she was pregnant and then he moved in with me cause our kid was missing. I would be peeved too. Either way though Win is trying to get in touch with her family to see if they know where she is. I'll update this post when/if I know more.

 Hey nosleepers! Sorry this has taken so long. A lot of things have happened.

Jake, Win, and myself, are home and healthy and safe. We had a few cops hanging around for a while but it's all finished now.


The security guard from the hospital? He took Jake. He left the box of things for us to find. He came into our home while we were gone and took those things back after a set amount of time. I only got to keep the key card because I had Jake's keys with me when he came here. He did the same to the families of every woman we found in that room, only they came alone. I would have ended up as his next victim had I not brought Win with me.

He would take the child, keeping them alive and well, dragging them around with him as he planted clues, and then he would sedate them when the mother got close enough to find them in the room. If the mother came alone, he would sedate her, kill the child, and move on to the next victim. He was looking for someone to win his game. I guess he was looking for me.

According to the police, his home was full of pictures of me. Some taken from my Facebook page, some he took himself from short distances while I was out or working, dating back to the time I was volunteering at the hospital. It seems I was his end target. He had deemed me smart enough to win.

The hospital has been shut down now, the guard is being held in a secure wing at the forensic hospital, and my life is going back to normal.  No one has heard from Steph, her things are gone from the apartment she shared with Win, her phone is disconnected, and were moving on. Win, Jake, and I, are going to be a family like we should have been. None of us can stand being apart. As Im typing this, Win is sitting on one side of me, Jake is asleep with his head on my shoulder, and the dog is asleep on him.

Everything is going to be okay. I just wish we could find Steph.


Update: (I know I said this was final.)
___________________________________________________________________________________________

I just wanted to let everyone know Jake is doing great being home with us. He doesn't even really seem freaked out about what happened. He says he knew we'd find him, just like I knew he was okay. I swear this kid and I have some sort of telepathic link. #momproblems. Win hardly leaves our side. We've decided to keep Jake out of school for a bit until things calm down so I'm down to part time hours at work and I'm homeschooling him. All three of us sleep in my bed every night with the dog. We tried putting Jake in his own room last night but no one could sleep and the dog wouldn't stop freaking out so we brought him back in with us and everything was fine

On the Steph front, there hasn't really been much. Win has been in touch with her parents but they haven't heard from her since Jake went missing. Her phone rings straight to voicemail. I thought I saw her walking by across the street from my work the other day. I was out smoking on the front stoop at sunset, which is of course the least conducive time visibility wise, but I would have sworn it was her. I yelled her name a few times but she didn't look up. I guess it wasn't her.

Win has thrown himself into being Jake's dad and being here for me. I know he's still shaken from Jake being missing and I know he's terrified something's happened to Steph and the baby. A lot of the pregnancies Win creates seem to end in miscarriage. There are just a lot more questions than answers right now.

I'll keep updating this post until I run out of space.

 




 I'm Canadian! Born and raised. 




 No idea! The redditors don't like me. :(
I added the second update to the third one and the final one will be up in a few days!

 I had a hard time getting that one to stay up so I added it to this one. 




 Stay safe OP. Bottled water for a while and be mindful of what you eat. Keep us updated! 




 First Update: 

After spending nearly half the day yesterday between the ear drum shattering roar of Wins straight-piped Integra, and telling people over and over about my missing child and begging them to put up his missing posters, Im exhausted but somehow still too wired for sleep. We didn't find anything new. The map is missing. I swear I had it in my wallet and now it's gone. I'm sure I set it down somewhere and forgot it.
As with most missing posters, a phone number, mine to be specific, is on the bottom of the poster we've been putting up, asking people to call us if they have any information. I've had a few prank calls, a few well-wishers, and way too many false sightings. But tonight I had a different kind of call. Tonight a man who said he was a security guard at the mental hospital left me a message telling me he could help me. My phone didn't ring, but somehow between checking it at Tim Hortons and checking it again about 15 minutes later at home, Id had a call.
Now, this hospital is nearly abandoned. I mean there might be 50 patients left, all long term residents with nowhere else to go, no doctors on staff, nurses and CCAs take care of the daily work and a Doc visits once a week. I used to volunteer there a few years ago, reading books to patients. I dont remember this particular security guard but I was only there for a few hours a week so thats not all that strange is it? Anyway his message said to give him a call at 5am when hes on break so thats what Im going to do.
On the way home earlier I had thought the radio was talking about missing kids in town but after frantically fumbling at the volume knob and nearly knocking the car into neutral, it turns out theres a fourth woman gone missing. The newest one, Catie Millier, is an old school friend and her son is about Jakes age. Sad. I hope they find her. The last one turned up dead in New Brunswick.
I got up at 4:45 so I could be awake to call the guard at 5. I was sitting downstairs at the kitchen table drinking tea and smoking when Win, looking rather disheveled, stumbled in and sat across from me. I dialed the guards number and put the phone on speaker so we could both hear. His name is Tim, and from what I gather he remembers me from the days I volunteered there. He asked if we had found anything Jake might have left behnd, like clues or anything, which I thought was a bit odd. We told him that yes, we had found a few things but were having a hard time making sense of them. It wasn't until he asked what Jake had left behind that I really got concerned. I guess you could say my "spidey senses" were tingling. I really just wanted to end the conversation there because I wasn't sure how this man though he could help us, of ir he had just wanted to snoop, or if he knew something he wasn't saying. Win got mad though and started cursing at this guy. I shushed him and leaned closer to the phone. Tim had gone silent and in the background over the hiss of the line, I could hear a loud speaker. Code White. All staff report to central desk. Patient Miller armed and considered dangerous. The line abruptly went dead and we were left stunned in the deafening silence of the kitchen. Patient Miller. Its an awfully big coincidence that she just went missing and I heard her last name during that phone call. I wonder
Win has decided were going there tomorrow (today now I guess. We haven't slept.) Sunday is the day all the family members visit so we're hoping to blend into the small crowd. Hopefully security lets us in with no trouble but if not, I still have my pass card and hopefully my alarm code is still the same. We need to find out whats happening there.
I still haven't figured out how to add pictures but since the map is missing anyway I guess it doesn't matter. I've asked around a bit and the key is almost certainly for a pad lock. No one knows what the pass card is for but it seems like a logo has been filed off somehow. Almost in the size and shape of the logo on my pass card for the hospital.
My dog has been barking out my bedroom window for about an hour now. She stops for a few minutes at a time but keeps growling. We've gone outside and looked around but don't see anything. The house is locked up tight and we're all safe and sound in here.
I'll update more as soon as I can. We're going to check out the hospital after work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second Update:


We got into the hospital. 


My pass card still worked and my alarm code was the same. We got in no problem. We searched around for a while and couldn't find any staff and all of the patients were locked in their rooms for the night. I wanted to explore but needed someone to watch my back so Win set up shop in the empty security booth to keep watch over the cameras. Before I set out I grabbed a flashlight from the desk and called him on my cellphone so we could keep in constant contact. 


The hospital itself seemed exactly the way I left it, except deserted. Only one of four wards was currently in use and housed all of the current residents. Charts were stacked neatly, chairs were pushed in, it seemed like everyone had just left for the night. None of the patient rooms had names on them, just numbers, so there were no answers about Catie Miller from that. I figured Id keep looking and come back to check out the charts later. I checked every room, jiggling the door handle and shining the flashlight in the small windows to see which rooms had patients. This whole time I had Win in my ear asking questions and letting me know I was alone. The hallway I was in seemed to go on forever. The way the hospital is set up is the main hub, with a corridor running off of each of the four sides. Three of them were shut with large steel doors, chained and padlocked. 


I kept walking down the hallway I was in, expecting to hit a dead end, but instead I ran into a pair of steel doors just like the ones closing off the other wards. Only these ones were propped open with door stops. Behind them lay a few more feet of corridor, and what looked like a pair of elevator doors. I looked for buttons but couldn't find any, so I pulled the flat head screwdriver out of the bag slung across my shoulder and pried the damn doors open. 


The walls in this corridor were disgusting. They were brown and damp looking with veins of black running from floor to ceiling. The lights were dim and flickering and the smell was unbelievable. Win let me know I had gone past the last camera and I was walking blind. I told him to head my way since the ward was empty and it seemed safer now for us to be together. I walked back out of this weird hallway and waited by the elevator type doors until he arrived. I hadn't realized how anxious I was until he came into view but I practically flying-squirreled him out of excitement to see him. 


Together we walked back into the hallway and started looking around. There were bits of paper on the floor here and there and we could hear a steady hum, barely audible over our own breathing. Following the hum led us around a corner to a set of sliding doors like youd imagine for a quarantine section. My pass card wouldn't work but the card from Jake's keys opened them. We weren't prepared for what we found behind them. It looked like the morgue. A row of steel tables ran the length of the room and our breath could be seen in the air. 


On the tables lay a row of women, seemingly naked, and covered from chest to knees by a neatly folded sheet. The closest to the door was a very familiar face. It was Catie. I walked cautiously over to her and checked her pulse, which thankfully she still had. That was when I noticed each woman was connected to an IV. Whoever put them here was keeping them sedated and alive. For what?


We checked each womans pulse, and each was colder than the last, her heart beating a little bit slower, but every last one was still alive. Win went over to check the rows of doors for body storage and in each of the 9 drawers there was a child, male and female, around the same age, none of them with a pulse. One child for each woman in the room. Turning away from the gruesome sight I realized there was one table left, the figure on it covered entirely by a sheet. The IV was still running so we pulled down the sheet and I hit the floor. My son, my Jake, laying on that metal table in that room with all those women. And that was when I realized it. 

All of the women on that table looked like me. Dark hair, dark eyes, short, thick around the middle. We had similar features, seemed to be around the same age.


Jake was alive. He still had a pulse. Win dialed 911 while I held Jakes hand and sobbed into his sweater. All of the children in the drawers were naked but he was still fully clothed, wearing that sweater. It was mine when I got pregnant and he had claimed it a few years ago. It was still huge on him but the kid loved it because it had my name on the sleeve.

 
Win says it was only about 15 minutes but it seemed like a week before the police and paramedics showed up. Teams and teams of them. The coroner arrived shortly after but we didnt get to speak with him as Jake had been given something to wake him up and he was starting to come around. We left in the ambulance with him and were currently at the hospital. Jake is frail and thin and the poor kid is so pale but hes happy to see us and hes eating jello and we have officers outside the room keeping us safe.  Win just came back in from giving his statement and now its my turn. Ill update as soon as I can.
 




 I agree with the salt. Do the doorways and windows, and maybe a circle around your bed. 

Have you thought of doing what it says? Just... going up north? I'm sure us nosleep-ers would have your back! 




 Could you take a sample of the water to have it tested independently? Do you have a meal hall on campus, could it be food poisoning? Does your roommate have any chronic health issues? It could be a virus attacking those who are susceptible?
Edit: Could it be lead poisoning? The article says the building was built is the 20's. 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2gcei5/jake_update/
Just a little update and some strange goings-on. I'll add more as soon as there is more. Thanks for your well wishes. 




 I'll add photos as soon as I figure out how. I feel like we're missing something obvious. I think the key is for a padlock but there isn't a lock in the entire house. I'm back to work this weekend but will update as often as possible. 




 No one at the school seems to remember him leaving. Everyone's response is the same. "His dad picked him up for a doctor's appointment. Expect him home later this evening." It's almost like it's scripted, like they have no other information on it. The police have no where to turn. There are no leads, no evidence, Jake's just... gone. Disappeared. I haven't figured out the stuff in the box yet but we're trying. He's such a smart kid, I know he left us something, I feel like I'm missing it. I'll update as soon as I know more. 




 Original was taken down as an intro. Adding the update here. Hopefully it stays up.

I suppose I should start this off by giving you a little bit of background so that things Ill mention further into my story will make sense. Here goes.

My name is Sarah, Im 23, and my 7 year old sons name is Jake, Yes that means I had him at 16. I was raised by a mechanic and a seamstress so resourceful and scrappy are second nature along with being just a little bit wild, hence being a teen mom.

I had never really put much thought into sharing my story but recently my cousin Diane mentioned r/nosleep  and after lurking here for a while I thought you all might be able to offer some advice or at least some support. Let me cut to the chase. My son has been missing for about 2 months. 2 weeks ago, they called off the search.

I work as a nanny and when Im at work, Jake hangs out with my mom. We all live together in a townhouse with a handful of cats and a dog who thinks shes a cat. We have a good and calm life and aside from scaring the shit out of myself on a regular basis with gore and horror, nothing eventful happens. I work, Mom works, Jake goes to school. Hes one of the smartest kids I've ever met. He loves to read and draw and he can make music with just about anything. His bedroom is right next to mine.

I hadn't seen Mom or Jake for about 2 days, which sounds terrible but because I work night shifts, Mom works days, and Jake is in school, we can pass like three ships in the night for a few days at a time. I got in around 8:30am, crawled into bed with my dog, and passed out like it was a normal day, but let me tell you, it wasn't. I woke up startled and uncomfortably sweaty around 4:30pm to my dog barking frantically at my bedroom door, hopping up and down trying to get out to see my Mom who was in the bathroom across the hall. I let her out and followed her, rubbing sleep from my eyes, and adjusting my shirt so that nothing was hanging out. (Im a rough sleeper.) Mom opened the bathroom door to greet us and I could tell something wasn't right. She explained to me that when she had gone to pick Jake up from school, she was informed that his father had picked him up for a doctors appointment at around noon and that we should expect him to be dropped off to us later in the evening.  That wasn't all that strange, Win picks Jake up all the time, but usually he tells us first, and Jake didn't have a doctors appointment. Mom had tried calling Win from the car but had no luck so after I tried a few times, I gave his fiance Steph a call.

Steph: Hey Sarah, how are things? Hows Jake?
Me:  Hey Steph, thats why Im calling. Jakes school told us that Win picked him up this afternoon. Its totally cool if he did, god knows the kid could use an afternoon off, its just that he didn't tell me so Im worried.
Steph: Sarah I dont really want to be the one to say this, but Win and I have been home together all day. I was sick this morning and he called off work so we could just hang out. Im going to explain to him whats going on and well be right over okay?
Me: Okay Steph. Dont let him drive. The last thing we need is you guys getting hurt.

By this time I had started to panic a little. Mom was watching me, still standing in the bathroom doorway, and I slid down the hallway wall into a seated position. I waved my hands at her and stared blankly and thankfully the poor woman understood I needed a cigarette.  She sat down across from we and we just sat there staring blankly til the dog ran down the stairs to greet Steph and Win.
They yelled Hey! while trudging up the stairs, the dog trying her best to herd them. Shes a half-assed Border Collie. Steph sat down with us and Win stepped over mom and I in the hallway and opened Jakes bedroom door. It looked exactly as it had 2 days before when I tucked him in. The bed was rumpled, books under and on top of the covers, a precarious pile of even more books with a water glass on top stacked beside the bed. His window was open a crack, which seemed strange, but I couldn't really place why. I got up and followed Win in, putting my arm around his back and feeling comforted when he wrapped his arm around my shoulders in response. Together we rifled through all of Jakes books, flipped pages and lifting dust jackets, finding nothing. A final scan of the room showed one lone book sitting atop his dresser, nearly falling of the edge. It wasn't really a book but one of those magnetic boxes that look just like a book. Inside was a set of keys, what looked like a map obviously drawn by Jake, and a framed photo of Win, Jake, and I. 

We called the police. I had a feeling we were making a mistake, involving them wouldn't end well, but everyone else insisted so I gave in. Two officers came and checked out the house, gave Jakes room a once over, (at least my family let me hide the book-box just in case they wanted to take it,) and before they left I asked them to dust and fingerprint the window frame and sill. They treated me like I was crazy, because were on the second floor, but they did it because mom and I swore the window had been closed. The cops left to talk to a few people at Jakes school and file the report for us and that was the most action they ever took. A month and a half and no leads later, after questioning and accusing everyone I hold dear, including myself, multiple times, the search was called off and the case was deemed cold.

Win and Steph had been living with us by then, alternating sleeping on the couch and on an air mattress in my room with me. Steph's sick was actually morning sickness that was very nearly killing her, and the history between Win and I was beginning to cause some tension. The day the case was declared cold, Steph walked out on Win and seldom returns his calls. He started sleeping in my bed. Nothing happened. We didnt even cuddle. But being apart made us both anxious so we were sticking together. We still are. 

This is way too long and wordy for one post. I just wanted to give background. I'll add more tomorrow.
___________________________________________________________________________________________

[UPDATE]

Win and I havent left each others sides. We do everything together. Last night we drank some wine and had a look at Jakes map again. It seems like to starts at our house, and takes us to the mental hospital by the community college campus, in sort of a 7 year old round about fashion. I dont know if he was confused, trying to confuse us, or trying to confuse whoever was watching him draw it. I can only tell because he used the same symbols Ive been teaching him since he started school. # is always home. I used to draw it on city maps and in his school agendas so he would always know that if he was lost, that was home. The ferry terminal, ~ (waves,) the school, ^ (dunce caps, he doesnt get this one but it makes me laugh,) and the two hospitals nearly across from one another, + (EMERG) and +  (Mental Hospital.) The map seems like its meant to go on but he was stopped short of finishing it. The keys are his, but with two additions. The first is a tiny brass key like youd use for a padlock, the second is one of those little keychain cards, like a store loyalty program, only its completely white with only the scan strip on the back. Ill admit we were a few sheets to the wind when we discovered what the map meant. Perhaps thats why it came to me so easily, who knows. After a particularly energetic round of the bed-spins, I was trying to steady myself, sitting against the footboard toying with the framed photo of Jake, Win, and I, flipping it over and over in my hands to distract myself. As I turned it back and forth I began to notice that the frame and the back were not entirely attached anymore. As if someone had separated the front metal frame from the velvet covered cardboard backing. Win had been rolling back and forth across the bed for a while but when he saw me slip my thumbnail into the space between the frame and the back he sat bolt upright. He leaned over and peered into the space as I used my nails to pry the gap apart. I expected to find nothing and boy was I shocked when I noticed the piece of paper wedged in there. We pulled it out and unfolded it and in Jakes carefully practiced, uneven lettering, it said I am Taken. Mom Hide. We mulled that over for a while and came up with nothing, eventually passing out on top of the covers, fully clothed. So this morning Im sitting here writing this, nursing a horrendous wine hangover, and attempting to eat the greasy fried egg Win swears will fix it. Were going out today to put up some posters and talk to some people. SOMEONE must know where my child is and Im gonna find them. Ill update when we get home if theres any information.
