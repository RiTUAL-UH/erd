 I believe it was a 5 hour session if I remember correctly. I did go back for a 1 hour touch up after all the healing. 




 Here's mine. I basically just took the album that inspired me the most and went with something from it.

 Dude. That is also a very well done job. I really like it. Calgary Ocular Orifice tats all the way. 




 Haha definitely bumped into you. Was an awesome show. 




 Sweet dude, thanks! 




 I had posters I was guarding with my life so I stayed back and head banged my neck stiff. 





























 I simply would like to know in what order have the bands been playing. I am attending tomorrow nights show, and I really would like to catch the faceless. Between getting off work and putting my son to bed I know I'll be running a little late. Thanks in advance, I am so stoked for tomorrow. 







































 Personally I'd love to see Construct and Avalanche, so many great memories on both. Big Team CTF on Avalanche was always my favorite map and game type combination. Also getting those easy grav lift grenade to head shot kills on Construct was too much fun, I could have done that all day. 

What does everyone else think?

Took sometime to clean it up, but worth it.

**FIRST "OPIATE" PRIZE WINNER?**

**It would appear that some lucky individual has won the first 'golden ticket' ("SEAL OF XATANITOS"), that was included in one of the first hundred or so 21st anniversary OPIATE CD packages that have been shipped out. From what I've been told, the winning 'seal' was inserted into the variation colored grayish-silver. Once I get all the details from Merch, I will post the name of the winner along with his or her photo.**


Looks like we'll find out what those seals are pretty soon.

EDIT: the greyish-silver is the [second variation](http://imgur.com/a/uSWpI) from what I can see. 







































 So I'm putting together a slideshow for my Mother's 75th birthday this year and I found an old picture that needs a little help. If anyone could help I'd really appreciate it, thanks reddit.

 So I went to see one of my all time favorites tonight, Animals As Leaders, during their supporting show for Meshuggah here in Calgary, Alberta. Grabbed my tickets, got inside and got a beer. As the guy poured my beer he commented on what was supposed to be tonight's short concert. Asking why, he explained that Tosin of AAL tried to break up a fight in Boston between a cop and a rowdy concert goer, that turned out to be an obstruction of justice charge apparently. I couldn't fucking believe it.
So pissed I sold my tickets and left like a sulking baby. So heads up for anyone else anticipating an upcoming Animals As Leaders show in Canada.

**tl;dr** Animals As Leaders forbidden to travel internationally for the time being.

Edit: It was Javier Reyes, and not Tosin Abasi. Thanks Triangular_Desire. 




 "Hold On" was featured. Thought it was suiting. Thoughts? 














 So I'm looking for a picture of [Jamie Foxx](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aK8sF75Y5xE/UMYD0U80luI/AAAAAAAAK_Q/vFkeZOqDNis/s1600/jamie-foxx-surreal4real-charity-event-02.jpg) colored white (kind of like the Wayans brothers from the terrible movie [white chicks](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381707/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)) and dressed up as Dexter doing something [Dexter](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/09/09/dexter460.jpg) would do. Can anybody help? It doesn't have to include the pictures I've linked.

EDIT: I promise not to repost it to /r/dexter as my own work. I legitimately want to get my friend going.  









 THIS IS AMAZING AMIRITE? 






















































 AMIRITE? I MEAN ALL COMPLAINING ASIDE, THESE ARE THE BEST MAPS TO COME WITH HALO 4 MULTIPLAYER, BUT WHY THE FUCK DO THEY KEEP GETTING VOTED IN? 




 [Here's his picture](http://i.imgur.com/GT8qe.jpg), any and all suggestions/help would be appreciated. He's a buddy of mine, and these posters will have to go up at here at work so SFW would be best. Thanks so much Reddit! 









 I have zero Photoshop capabilities, so I thought I would reach out to the Reddit community for some help to make these pictures a little more hilarious than they already are. I know they are kind of blurry, sorry about that.

[Picture #1](http://i.imgur.com/kdyaX.jpg)
[Picture #2](http://i.imgur.com/xAPMb.jpg)

Any help would be greatly appreciated! 




 Does anyone have any that I can download? I know the search function for this is kind of hooped for the time being, but I'm aware that searching VIA gamer tags works. I'm looking for all and everything, especially Team Snipers. Any recommendations?  




 So I flew through Toronto to catch a Tool show on my way back from vacation in 2009. I was seated next to another dude flying solo at the show, he ended up taking a bunch of pictures, I asked him to email them to me and he came through, stand up fellow. [Thought I'd share.](http://imgur.com/a/sLvvN) 

It was your [standard 10000 Days setlist](http://toolnavy.com/showthread.php?t=114069). Also, [this](http://i.imgur.com/St1as.jpg) is the poster from the show, might be my favorite from the three I have.

Yeah some of them are blurry, but there are a few nice one's in there. Unfortunately this is the best resolution I have.

 














 Has anyone made the joke "it's been 10000 days since their last album" yet?  



















 Am I the only one that thinks halo 4 multiplayer is vastly similar the Call of Duty series? I was never a fan of those games for many reasons, 1) Unfair advantages among players due to tactical load outs 2) Point count for wins 3) Weapon markers 4) Ordinance. This game may look/play nice but it's so far from halo that I find myself quite turned off, I miss that level playing field we all once had, where the good gained advantage with knowledge. Anyways just my two cents. Just curious if I am alone on this. Oh I forgot to mention the sounds, every standard halo noise is basically gone. 









 After the birth of my son 11 weeks ago I've been somewhat out of the halo loop, I'm on right now and noticed the anniversary big team playlist is no longer available. Why did I buy them if I can't play them, am I missing something? 


































 Hey everyone, I'm at a loss as to where I'm supposed to turn next so I thought I would try r/newfoundland. My wonderful mother 74 years of age was a victim of robbery this past week. She has never been an overly wealthy woman, using what little wealth she has to support her very large family. Her house is small and quaint and doesn't contain many valuables (her television is tubed and her stereo is 15 plus years old, among the rest of her things that were left behind by the thieves). She has always been content with her humbled life and the only valuables she's ever really had came in the form of a few small rings passed down through the generations of our family. These rings of course hold no real monetary value (very small weight in gold), but the sentiments they hold in my mothers heart are unmatched. 

I know this is such a long shot but if anyone has seen or heard anything in regards to breaking and entering and the sale of used jewelry on the streets in the Grand Falls area, could you please let me or the police know. It would mean so much to her to actually retrieve these small items and/or see the culprits brought to justice.

I completely understand that there are problems in our society, and that drug addiction among other things, can bring people to carry out the unspeakable, but it breaks my heart knowing that there are those who prey on the elderly. It's about time these actions are taken seriously by the system, and the law works in favor of the victims.

If by some even slimmer chance someone who was directly involved manages to read this, if you somehow still have my mothers jewelry and have it in you to return it, I will most certainly not pursue this any further, I would walk away knowing that all hope isn't lost. I would forgive you personally, and I will hold that gesture in such high regard for the rest of my time on this earth. I do not wish to seek revenge, but to make things right.

If you think you might know something and require further description please PM me.

Thank you for your time.
