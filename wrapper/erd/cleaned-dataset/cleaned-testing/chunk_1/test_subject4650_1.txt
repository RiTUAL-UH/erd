 I'm editing a multi-camera live concert video that was shot with a bunch of DSLRs and a BMCC. The BMCC has vastly superior image quality, but as the night goes on, it seems to have developed a dozen or more hot pixels that show up as white or coloured dots and are quite noticeable on a black background.

Any ideas on how to make them less noticeable? Thanks in advance guys! 









































































































































































 So we've been using sennheiser in ear monitors for the last 12 months or so, with the stock earbuds, and recently I had a chance to use the same radio pack and microphones with a set of shure earbuds. I didn't see what model they were, but they absolutely blew me away, the sound was just crystal. Full and clear. 

So as I hunt around for earbud options, I thought I'd consult the pros here - have you guys found nirvana in a stage earphone? What should I check out?

 




 An update to the thread I posted last week...

So today my band and I taped our Starking appearance. We sang with Girl's Day - at least, three of them, Minah must have known I'm dangerous and stayed away.

I never realized just how young those girls are - but they were totally charming, super professional and heaps of fun. Then we did a couple of songs with Brown Eyed Girls, who came across as... Sort of grumpy.

I don't know how our singing went, but we had an awesome time with the new hosts, Boom and Teuk (ex super junior) and it was a pretty damn hilarious day all up, once all the waiting around was out of the way. They seemed to think we kicked some butt, so who knows, it could lead us somewhere. :)

it's going to air in late November, I'll get a copy when I can and stick it on YouTube - but yeah, I thought you guys would appreciate what a crazy day I just had! :D 









 I sing with an Australian a cappella group, we're in Korea quite regularly, this will be our third visit this year. One of the things we love to incorporate in our show is bad imitations of k-pop songs, it's pretty funny since we're all guys.

Long story short, some TV producers saw us singing Twinkle Twinkle earlier this year and they've invited us to do a broadcast later this week.... And it seems like they're bringing Girl's Day in for the show as well. I have no idea what's going to happen, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be hilarious. :)

Wish us luck! 





































































 I've got a nice frontpage setup, but I like to see what's going on in the rest of the reddit world as well. Seeing as there's a few specific subreddits that are super popular but totally not of interest to me, is there any way to filter them out? 




 I've manually created a vignette effect (I know, I know) that I want to use on a dozen or so clips. I'm just dipping my toe into after effects, is it easy to save that adjustment layer and copy it across to the other clips, or am I missing the point? :) 




 I'm starting to shout at my telly now, having just come through the Vice section. The evidence is so weak and the questions so vague at this point of the game that you're more or less just guessing in interrogations. Even when you get questions right, you seem to get bugger-all in return. And it doesn't matter if you stuff every question up, the game goes on. It's like a movie in which you twiddle a thumbstick every now and then to get to the next scene.

The action is pretty ordinary and formulaic, the driving is both boring and unnecessary, the city has little in it that makes me want to explore further, the main character is a bit of a prat... Sure, the stories are great and the character animations fantastic - but the gameplay is so fucking irritating that I'd probably be happier if I left it alone and never finished it.

Next to Red Dead Redemption, this feels like a gimmicky vehicle for the awesome animation work of Team Bondi, a half way step towards future games that might put the technology to better use. But that might just be me. 














 I want to expand my abilities... Can you guys throw out some quick tips on how to make a project more visually interesting with the footage you've got? If you can point to any example videos I'd love to see them.  




 Sorry guys, beginner's question here: I'm working on a 25fps sequence using footage from 2 cameras - a Sony HDV camera and a Canon 7D. We've shot interviews and the like from 2 angles and want to be able to cut back and forth between vision from the two cameras - but it seems they shoot in slightly different frame rates.

If I create a 25fps sequence and just drop in the 23.975fps footage, does Premiere CS5 just sort frame rate issues out? Or do I need to process it somewhere else? Oh, and sorry if this is a stupid question! 









 Hey guys - just a quickie. I've been using prores transcoding in FCP, which does a great job of making 7D footage editable. Now I have to do a reasonably large project in CS5 - should I edit the 7D footage straight, or transcode it to something?

If I need to transcode it, can I do it using the Apple Compressor, or does Adobe have its own tool that works better? What format works best?

Cheers in advance! 














 Hey guys - thanks for the inspiration. I'm on day 2 of keto plus a few weeks into Starting Strength; I'm gonna be a total posterboy for reddit body transformation... heh heh. 

I'm struggling already though... The thought of greasy food for dinner again is making me a bit nauseous, plus I feel headachy and drained. Just checking in to make sure this is normal... Is it? 
























 Hi guys - and thanks for giving me the inspiration to get back to training after more than 10 years on my arse.

I went in and did my first squats, deads and press workout today, and ended up in a conversation with the guy running the place. I've got bad knees as a result of way too much basketball when I was younger, and I'm now carrying a lot of weight (~125kg) - getting my legs back in shape to support dodgy knees is the main reason SS appealed to me. I've been doing bodyweight broomstick squats at home for the last month or so.

The gym guy, an old fella who seems experienced in free weight training, is telling me I shouldn't jump straight into 5-rep heavy lifting in search of strength. That since I haven't been in a gym for 10 years I should spend at least a month doing low weights for 20-30 reps on things like leg extensions, unweighted or low weight bar squats and the like, in order to prepare my tendons and ligaments for the stress, that if not, I'm risking a blowout at the squat rack with severe consequences.

This seems to go against what Rippetoe says in SS - that the squat is not only the perfect conditioner of connective tissue, but that done properly, it shouldn't be dangerous. The way I read it, he seems to be saying learn the right forms and get straight into it. I'm confused... Help! 












































 So we're replacing a band member, and have found one strong candidate who seems to have a lot of the attributes we need - a rare combination. But his groove is non-existant - too much time in the classical world I think.

I've got time to spend with him if we decide he's our man, but I wonder what you guys' experiences are. Is groove innate or can it be trained? Will I be pushing shit uphill if I try to train him? And how would you go about it? Mixtapes? Metronomes? One-on-one sessions? 

Any ideas? 




















































































 Thought I'd bring this one up because it always tends to flush out a bunch of other wonderfully horrific stories about how other dudes lost THEIR knackers. 

SO:

I was lucky, because my nut started to hurt. In most cases, testicular cancer is absolutely painless, which lets it grow and spread to the lymph nodes, lungs and eventually the brain (which is the state it got to before Lance Armstrong did anything about it).

In my case, it was caught early because I'm a rabid motorcyclist and was learning to pull wheelies. When you're learning wheelies, you tend to smack the bike down and bash yourself in the nads a lot. The best guess of the docs is that weeks of testicular trauma due to mousetrapped wheelies had caused a minor bleed into a tumour that was growing in ol' righty. The bleed caused it to swell until the nut was twice its normal size, it hurt like a thousand bastards and I got it diagnosed. So it could be said that wheelies may have saved my life. Honestly, officer.

Apparently most cases of testicular cancer are discovered by the missus, in the bath. Or so I'm told.

The rest of the process was fairly simple. They chop out the diseased bollock (though it's not a simple case of cut the ol' scrotum and pull it out, they actually go in from your stomach, below your navel and off to the side, go figure), you go stash some wigglies at the sperm bank and then go for a short round of chemotherapy, which has a 50% chance of permanently sterilising you.

Chemo sucks, in my case it was just one IV bag of one chemical, carboplatin, which is so toxic that the nurse carries it in wearing elbow-length gloves. A nice touch. The treatment took 45 minutes, after which I had to go sing a gig. That was interesting. It left me with no appetite or energy for weeks, and for the next 3-4 years I felt kind of foggy in the head, as if I was thinking through cotton wool. I can only imagine things are worse for people who have to go through longer treatments - Armstrong is a good example, he had to have five or six, the poor bugger. With just one treatment, I didn't even lose any hair.

Anyway, I didn't find the process overly scary, and apart from the annoying effects of chemo, I can honestly say that one nut works just as well as two (the missus tested it out just hours after surgery). Looks a bit odd, mind you, but then the frank 'n' beans have never struck me as particularly pleasing to look at, even in the best of times.

So hopefully if there's anyone out there that's just copped a nasty shock, found a lump or had a diagnosis, I can reassure you a bit. There's plenty of blog posts, articles and whatnot on the net where fellas make a big deal out of losing one ball, what it means to their manhood, and generally make it sound very scary. It doesn't have to be, though, and your life will go on just fine. The guy at [www.mybollox.com](www.mybollox.com) has a pretty healthy attitude about it all (and incidentally, the same doctor as I had).

As for the rest of you, if this post gets you to fondle your nuts or the nuts of somebody you care about, I'd consider that a win for everyone. Even if you don't find anything.

Fire away! 







































 I'll be doing up a full review in time, perhaps a video review too - but since this is such a breakthrough bike, arguably one of the two most fascinating superbikes of 2010 alongside the S1000R, I thought you motoreddit folk might have some questions. So if you do, ask away! 


































 I know what you want to say, and I know you're struggling to get it out, and I know YOU know I know. What I don't know is whether it's ruder for me to finish the sentence for you so we can move on, or to wait for you to finish and let you hang out there because I don't want to talk over you... 

So, uh, whaddya reckon, should I finish your sentences?
