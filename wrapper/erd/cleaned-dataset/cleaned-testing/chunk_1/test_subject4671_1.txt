 just out of curiosity...did you do your own health plan or follow p90x? 




 I don't understand all the hate coming towards this. You started with an already slim figure so the results aren't as drastic. However, you can definitely tell they are there. Congrats on finishing the 90 days! whats next? Insanity? Another Round?  




 quinoa is not easily bought near where i live as there aren't of ton of organic stores and all the main stores don't carry it 




 Hey all: this is my second week of p90x. For the first week i just took a normal diet and put it through loseit.com just to see what my percentages were. I roughly averaged 40% carbs, 30%protein, 30% fat. Obviously the p90x fat shredder is 50% protein, %30 carbs, 20% fat. So how do i bring up that protein number in some practical ways?

Here is a sample day of meals for me:

* Breakfast:oatmeal
* lunch:ham and turkey pita with provolone cheese/baby carrots/and grape tomatoes
* dinner: white bean and garbanzo bean chicken chili(over minimal rice)
* snacks:almonds(roughly 20 throughout the day), spinach shake(this is my recovery drink: 1 banana, 1 scoop protein powder, 1.5 handfuls spinach, 1/3 cup almond milk, 2 tbs peanutbutter, ice)

also what do you look for in a protein bar? 




 Just did my second chest and back + ab ripper x workout...I increase my weight on lawn mowers by 10lbs and did everything but the mason twist in ab ripper x. Currently drinking my protein/recovery drink 




 ANd behold tomorrow is rest day and it is very good. lol. My legs are on fire! upper body not so much. I used this first week to get myself into the rhythm of working out consistently...next week should be no excuses! pushing my body to the limit! 




 Hey, I'm also am doing the program(today is my day 6) and I wanted to give you some tips. 3 pushups doesn't seem to be a lot. I would consider doing 10 but moving to your knees if you have to(this is what i do). Anything less than 10 and you will be resting too much and stiffen up. Also with the chin ups try to do negatives(use a chair or jump up to where your chin is above the bar and then release as slowly as you can) 




 basically i have one scv per a command center building supply depots at all times. 




 Do/Did you drink a recovery drink on yoga days? especially during the early weeks? I'm on week 1 and i don't feel like i worked out nearly close to as hard as the other days(mainly due to not being very flexible). 




 isn't that Katu? He does Playhem casting once a week i think. He even plays zerg at high level. I believe i watched him beat oGsIllusion the other night. 




 reply i'm on day 4 but i agree! 




 I'll be updating this occasionally with a log of how I am doing. Not sure if i should do multiple posts.

Today will be day 3 of week 1...tbh I've never attempted this exercise in all my attempts at p90x...I'm always so sore and quit...today..I'm still sore but i will do the exercise.

right now: 5 foot 11 inches @ 190lbs. Lots of stomach fat + no upper body strength. 




 its on esltvs site http://tv.esl.eu/de/vod/view/23547 




 I may be really dumb but I can't seem to find all of them. The take tv sight has some...but not all. Anyone know best place to get them? 




 The problem is someone bought p90x for me as I can not afford it or another one really :( 




 I'm a 23 year old male 6 foot 190 lbs. I'm not happy with my upper body muscle and fat. I've tried P90X a couple of times but everytime i start, by the 4th or 5th day my body is exhausted and doesn't feel like it can go anymore. What do/did you do to get past this hump? Or What did you do to recover faster? 




 but don't you have to buy the game twice to get a second account? 




 aka but the game twice. no thank you 




 always fun watching the lakers lose! 




 the problem with this is that the current metagame has terran going fast gas for both terran and zerg(reactor hellions, fast tank/viking, cloaked banshee) where as versus protoss you do either one or two rax fast expand(no gas) 




 Hey, Just a general question that I think is helpful against all races. How do you deal with random players? I have three distinct builds for each race i'm playing and I really need to know by 11 food what the other player is doing(so I can go gas first if terran). How do you approach Random?

EDIT:Specifically for terran 




 no. We had one computer. But i didn't want her using the same account as me/save file. So we had separate ones so we could each play the game at our own pace. She have her stats and I have mine.  




 i'm sorry i lived in a house where it was a luxury to get one game a year? Both myself and my sister needed to be able to play it without running over each other. 




 quick question people. I had a friend move into my house and they want to play starcraft2. Do they have to buy their own copy? That seems unlikely because of how many houses have multiple children 




 same here 




 Is anyone else having problem with ads freezing screens. Specifically there is a Nikon ad that never seems to close. I keep having to refresh the stream until i get a different ad 




 i suggest trolling back and reporting him for spam 




 why else do you think they were giving away free tickets? they weren't trying to be nice...they were trying to get people to show up 




  you should a)have scouted the 4 gates+robo(i think standard scan of your opponents main is around 6:30ish) b)still be able to hold it off(if you are constantly producing out of 2 rax(bc 3rd rax is getting an add on) you should have enough to hold. Plus your opponent is incredibly all in at that point(he can kill 10 of your scv's and it wont matter bc you have two base down). Use the scv's to soak up damage(right click autorepair when you pull them so they soak up even more damage). You should be able to hold. 




 definitely do the 1 rax FE against toss and just grab 2-3 bunkers if you feel in danger. 2 Bunkers/8Marines/3scv's per bunker on autorepair holds off a 4 gate. You should have a stronger army...don't let the protoss max! 




 what would you suggest in regards to add-ons and order?
 




 what would you suggest in regards to add-ons and order?
 




 yeah i was just so use to doing 13 rax that i auto did it without thinking. If i get the add ons and he is 4 gating dont i lose bc i'm not producing units for that minute? 




 nvrmind...uploaded  




 I also added a replay of both builds 




 replay added 




 where can i load replays?
 




 I'm in the states and lagging really hard 




 Their event went live over an hour ago to air the playoffs and all its been is watching Orb and Gretorp get set up and scrolling graphics. Incredibly unprofessional. You don't see other sports delaying their broadcasts by an hour without some explanation. Heck we don't even see other broadcasters do this. Ridiculous! 




 thank you! i started doing the one rax expand and i found out that if i can hold off a 4 gate(which i can with two bunkers and scv's set to autorepair) then i do much better/win the game :) 




 I'm a gold terran who can beat the occasional plat zerg and plat terran. I struggle against silver level protoss. Anyone have any tips. I open 3 rax into expand-mmm with vikings and ghost as neccesary and 3/3 ups. Still get destroyed by toss going colossi or DT's or anything

EDIT:Adding in replays for those of you that wanted it

 gold terran/silver zerg

test_subject4671.465 




 So i was looking through the Open Bracket(http://s3.majorleaguegaming.com/2011-providence-starcraft2-open.html) and there are some sick matchups starting the day:

* Gatored(who beat Ganzi) vs Leenock
* EGMachine vs Nestea
* Spanishiwa vs TLO
* Losira vs colMVPsc
* Hero vs Keen
* Sheth vs Major/Terran/Princess/xSix[fillintheblank]


Personally I'm looking forward to Machine vs Nestea. I really like machine. Which of these matchups are you most looking forward to? 




 thank you! 




 i don't run adblock 




 I'm a MLG silver member and I can't  get a voucher for the event...any one else having same issues? 




 So i've been watching EGMachine and for the life of me I dont understand why he doesn't have more viewers. He commentates every single game and really interacts with his chat. Also, he seems to do well at MLG's beating players like Slush, Tyler, etc. He also keeps a pretty good schedule of streaming often.

 listen to this man. Battlestar Galactica is AMAZING 




 Hi! i'm a gold level Terran and i've been dominating TvZ using the MVP build. Here are some quick notes.

1.)you didnt expand fast enough. Using this build you should be able to throw down a little bit after you start producing Helions.
2.) only produce 4 helions. This is the amount you need to get map control. Remember, the MVP style is about not taking damage and controlling the map instead of causing damage via drone harass.
3.)Once you switch your 1st factory to a tech lab. throw down gas #2 and factory #2. I prefer getting  an early siege as opposed to stim since the MVP build has no medivac usage...you actually hurt yourself with stim.
4)as soon as your second siege tank finishes, float your orbital down to expansion(circa 7-9 minute mark), transfer scvs, build gas 3 4(2 workers in each), and throw down engineering bay for upgrades and turrets to defend mutas.
5.)now you can actually afford the 4 marines/2 seige tank/ 2scv/supply depot production you were trying to pull off. 3rd goes down around 11 minute mark which should also be when you make your first push. Keep marine behind siege tanks and have your tanks hot keyed to go into siege mode. AS SOON AS YOU SEE creep, seige up and take out 3,4 tumors. 

Thats all i can think of now. I may download a replay for you to see of me doing the build. Also, if you want to practice i play zerg as well test_subject4671.465 




 do you have an example (ie 2 rax into expand into factory or something like that) 




 hi all! gold level terran here. I'm struggling with the tvt match as i feel i really dont have a solid build or key idea. In silver league i could just mass marine marauder and get my upgrades to +3/+3 by the 16 min mark and win. Now in the gold league, other players macro is better and there is a significant use of siege tanks. I've been opening with a fast banshee build order:

10 supply
11 rax
13 gas
15 orbital
as soon as i have 100 gas-factory
once factory completes throw down reactor and starport
once starport finishes switch onto reactor...keep producing marines/tanks and expand...the problem is that even if i do damage (6 scvs) my opponents seem to be able to attack me and kill me.. any suggestions? 




 i posted this last night and got downvoted to hell :( 




 painuser was suppose to arrive at the airport a hour ago to be picked up by sir scoots...and no one has been able to get in contact with him. this all via dj wheat twitter. Just trying to get the word out there http://twitter.com/#!/djWHEAT/status/130110499521167361 














 Hello from a member of the ODU alumni! My entire starcraft 2 group is ODU alumn :) VT is cool..i guess  




 hey, if you want a practice partner i'm a silver terran test_subject4671.465  I would like some tvp practice :) 




 game 2 boxer vs alive: boxer went for a fake helion reactor into cloaked banshee build but alive had a viking out in time an took little to no damage. The rest of the game played out with alive macroing better than Boxer(who has floating over 1k gas during a good segment of the game). Alive eventually killed Boxer's 3rd and then pushed in with marine/tank for the win. Also boxer used the userid of JethroGibbs for this match WINNER:Alive 




 Split screen not working 




 i went on a losing streak this morning but i still am ranked #2 in a silver league and constantly playing gold players.  




 how do i post replayz 




 50-60 workers in my usual game with a 4th base up and saturated usually. not claiming my micro/macro is perfect 




 i do have an 80% win rate in silver lol..bout to be gold as soon as i play more games.  




 Hey everyone,

I keep reading posts here that say "blah you are only silver league, all you have to do is have good macro and you advance." With that said I'm currently sitting on the silver/gold cusp and i disagree. I'm doing builds versus each race(2rax vs z, 3rax stim mm push, fast banshee) and executing them really well and most people hold these off. I then proceed to have a 20+ minute game where the only time i get over 600  minerals is when i max(600 because two factory thor). So what's your opinion? do we not give the lower leagues enough credit?

EDIT: I'm not saying i'm the best..i'm merely asking if we give the lower leagues credit :) 




 hmm...maybe i'm too into soccer to be a good evaluator of this fact. I do know that ever Sat and Sun ESPN2 shows an EPL game. But i agree that soccer has a much larger following than SC2. 




 i watch a ton of soccer and have never seen a commercial interrupted game. 




 sports like soccer have 45 minute halves with no adds at all. They simply state "this match is brought to you my gatorade" or something like that. I could see it being the same. 




 test_subject4671.465 silver terran 




 I'm silver terran test_subject4671.465 




 Silver Terran who is on at random times test_subject4671.465 




 i mad i couldn't see the games 




 any hurricane survival guides for the people in raleigh 




 Well i'm silver league and like everyone said...its will eventually depend on what build you want to do... but honestly i would throw a nexus down as soon as i begin floating the minerals necc to build one...usually ends up working nice, at least for terran 




 that might be my problem then...i never repair. Thanks! :) 




 Hey guys...silver league noob here...trying to get better. Anyways..I'm really struggling vs protoss...i find the other matchups easy...but i literally can not figure out for the life of me how to stop 4 gate pushes...bunkers near the front of my base? they warp into the back..mass marauders-killed...mass marines-killed....rushed to tanks-killed...help please?

Watching streams doesnt help me bc pros dont forgate really in pvt or pvz

Edit:To THose asking about warping in back...warp prism . 




 Destiny advocates a one base roach push strategy to stop this. You overlord on 9, spawning pool on 12, gas on 14(3-workers immediately) as well as roach warren, get a queen, and drone up to 20/26..then non stop roach/overlord production..if he doesnt have roaches out you win...and if he does he can not stop producing them or you will win...and since you are putting pressure on you can use one of your drones to expand. 




 Hey everyone, right now i'm chillin in the silver league as terran and am doing okay. learning/getting better all that jazz. The other day i started experimenting with the other races just to get a handle on how to scout them/etc. During this i found playing zerg to be especially fun...enough so that i legitimately am considering switching. My one question is how do you determine the # of lings you need to make at any one point...i always seem to make too few and get killed by early 3rax/4gate plays. or if i try to do a roach build i always get cannon rushed by protoss. I find if i can get to late game i'm beating everyone...so anyhelp stopping these early game pushes would be nice. 




 honestly i was able to beat the computer on hard/very hard by just microing out marine/maruader/medivac....but that does not prepare you for the game...I think its much better to just play 2-3 games on the ladder every day...as you play you should start to notice good timings etc 




 I started out just like you losing almost all my games. I quickly got very frustrated. What i found out is that i just didnt have a plan, i was building units willy-nilly and losing. I would suggest Day9 Dailies 257,267,285,and 289. But honestly the most important one to watch and digest as terran is #312. Once i watched that daily it all clicked for me. I'm now residing as a top Silver league terran who should be in gold any day now.
