 I find this usually happens when your zoomed in too much. zoom out a bit and then it should work cause it works for me.  




 I'm really looking forward to American Sniper are there any movies out right now that are similar to it that I should watch? 




 holy crap do people these days actually know how to spell? "you actually take the works right out of my mouth" do you even english? 









 THE NORTH REMEMBERS!  




 they need to demand that sony sell spiderman back to marvel.  









 Sony should release it claiming they have changed the ending when actual fact they havent. how would north korea know? unless they had a spy actually go watch the released cut.  




 Dont keep trying if it keeps declining it could still be charging you for each time you try. Id wait a bit, most likely the servers are getting borked.  




 Nice set up, like how you have the tv on the wall.  









 If we dont have a hulk movie by phase 4 im gonna be pissed.  














 It will easily play it, dont know about ultra tho. I run it on a gtx 660 with medium to high settings at 1080p.  









 Its one of the best pc ports ever. so yes you should buy it. Plus its not a bad game. even though its like an hour long if your going to play the phantom pain next year youll need to play this.  




 Nope works for me. I have an I7 4790, GTX 660, 8GB ram.  














 I got MGSV: GZ and Flight Simulator X.  









 Bilbo saw a dragon, frodo saw eagles. bilbo wins.  









 yea not funny at all.  









 enjoy your downvotes.  









 i reckon someone already has a copy of it and is sitting on it waiting for the right moment to leak it.  




 Didnt angels and demons cause a bit of controversy?  









 Hopefully someone leaks it.  




 well fuck sony, I hope the hackers screw them up so bad that they have no other choice to sell spiderman back to marvel.  









 its a good work laptop but its no gaming machine.  




 Ive enjoyed every minute of this show but im down to the last 3 episodes of season 2 and i really dont want it to end thats how much ive enjoyed it. Im debating whether or not to finish it now or wait for season 3 so i wont have to wait as long.  




 Nice, This is mine here in New Zealand. Its about 23 outside right now. http://iforce.co.nz/i/yv1r4bep.svc.jpg 




 because there never was a trailer. it was all rumor. it was never actually officially confirmed.  









 why? msi is awesome.  




 I personally will always go with the i7 model as the extra threads for work will come in handy. If you're just playing games then an i5 will be alright but youll find a few years down the line the i5 will begin to bottle neck when compared to the highest i7 at the time because of the extra threads. In some cases there is usually only a $50 difference between an i5 and i7 which is another reason i go for an i7. 
 




 did anyone else read that in the style of the CS voice over lol.  




 most likely testing it.  




 Apparently they are sold out http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/2plz1b/newegg_is_sold_out_of_its_free_3_games_from_the/ 




 usually there is a countdown timer on the steam page of a game thats releasing in a day or so but there is nothing on he ground zeroes page. It just says coming soon. Doesn't that seem a bit strange? or is it just that Konami doesn't know how to use steam? 




 yea? this was announced ages ago.  




 are you overclocking? try resetting to stock clocks and see what happens.  




 haha lol that sure surprised me.  




 its already the 18th here in New Zealand and im wondering why it hasn't started yet :( 




 sell the pc for what ever he can get and save up for new rig? 




 we already have DRM with movies from Itunes you cant play the file outside of Itunes hence its locked to one player. Thats DRM enough imo.  




 yes we have a special coming next year followed by S4 in 2016 but with Cumberbatch now signed on to play Doctor Strange i fear that we are only going to get less and less Sherlock despite Cumerbatch saying he wants to play him to an old man i fear his schedule just wont allow it which begs the question how much longer can the series keep going?  




 I agree and disagree. The way light sabers were used in the prequels was definitely one of the few positives in my books. That final duel between Obiwan and Anakin was incredible, it was just so beautifully choreographed it was like watching a well performed ballet. But i also agree that the duel between vader and luke in empire strikes back was amazing to. It all comes down to whether or not you prefer the prequels or original trilogy and clearly your a fan of the original trilogy and i can respect that. I seem to be one of the few fans who like both trilogies.  




 I'm assuming that's why it says potential. Doesn't necessarily mean it will happen.  









 love the way that 980 lights up. so awesome.  









 Bad AutoModerator!  




 obviously fake since GFWL is no more.  




 yes those specs are real, and yes the ps4 and xbox one are basically low end pcs that use proprietary hardware and cant be upgraded. Basically they are pcs without all the bells and whistles.  




 you ether have a shitty isp or you have some serious line issues ether in your house or between you and the exchange. get that shit sorted bro.  




 man thats to close to the edge.  




 he said $300 lol not $1000.  




 Just show them to this. http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/guide 




 Needs a bit more cable management when you get the time. But other than that looks good.  




 no way your building a pc with that you need at least $450 but even thats pushing it.  




 who has a limit? lol.  









 I find your lack of taste in movies disturbing.  




 its a small game bro, its like 2 and half hours long that sounds about right.  




 1080p easily. 1440p will be pretty decent but you may need to lower some settings. 4k will struggle.  




 you should be able to point steam to the directory of the second hard drive.  




 Because i already have everything i want. who knows this feeling? :( 




 i have $109 to be exact lol  




 na it sucks.  




 i got the images from here http://www.pcgamer.com/windows-10-leaked-build-reveals-new-xbox-app/

what do you guys think of this new xbox app for windows 10? is it a steam like app or just more DRM? i noticed on the bottom left there is a store icon. How cool would it be if we could purchase and play xbox games on pc? it would be a step in the right direction on microsofts part to make a unified experience which is what they hinted at a while ago with that windows 10 announcement that showed a pc, xbox one, tablet etc all lined up against each other. What do you guys think. 




 say you need to test it to make sure its not DOA. 




 Its a good game, dont listen to this review.  




 dude thats not good. Do other temperature reading programs have this issue cause if they do you probably need to reseat your cpu. just sayin.   




 yea that bit was leaked in the emails. its happening in january.  









 At least they're patching it. gotta give some credit. They could of chosen to just leave it the way it was but they did not.  




 The Crew,Fire Works Simulator, Final Fantasy XIII-2. 




 its actually one of the better COD games.  




 clearly a problem with your gpu. The game runs perfectly fine for me.  









 ether the cooler is not mounted properly or you need new thermal paste.  




 BUT 2 GPU  MUST BE BETTER THAN 1 AM I RITE? :( 




 LOL! INB4 CONSPIRACY.  









 What are your thoughts on the pc version so far? i picked it up and im actually enjoying it more than XIII.  




 Looks correct to me? what cpu do you have? nvm I see your flair, it says you have a i5 3570 which is the correct cpu its showing.  




 I would of said Aaron Taylor Johnson but hes already quick silver. Most of the good guys are taken already. they would probably have to cast an unknown but someone who could stand toe to toe on screen with the avengers cast.  
























 his facial expressions tho lol 




 dude nice!  




 And Im actually enjoying this more than FFXIII, makes you realize how badly written the lightning character actually was and the story is just so much better (especially without lightning) in XIII-2 imo.  




 Inb4 Bring Back Brody.  




 Even if its just for a cameo like he bumps into Quinn out on the streets of Pakistan and gives him a piece of advice or something about going rogue. Or he confronts Carrie about a CIA conspiracy or something. But they need to get him involved it would be awesome.  




 what temps are you getting? sounds like it might have gotten a bit dusty or your power supply isn't coping with the stress.  




 January 27th.  




 there was? got a link.  




 What movies do you consider to be a hidden gem? 









 haha this is awesome.  




 basically what the title says. do you think well see more high frame rate movies after the hobbit or does the format die with the release of the last hobbit movie? 




 Yea I skimmed through it and stopped when i saw pics of the actual script.  




 Ouch. Hope it turns out as good as Skyfall or at least Casino Royale.  




 Just scan your computer, thats all you can really do atm. Perhaps change your passwords to all your important accounts just in case.  




 Correct. ALI213 is the default name a particular pirated version of the game uses.  




 I almost choked on my own saliva reading this haha.  




 where have you been? hes talking about all the leaked emails from sony.  




 Im enjoying it. Havent really had an issue with the micro transactions since i dont use them.  




 Dude he's been awesome as spidey and it will kill him if this happens. Hes a true fan. They have to keep him.  









 thats a good thing! people need to realize that adaptations that steer away from their source material is a good thing since not everything translates well into film.  




 Box and Hardware Pr0n. Nice!  




 lol dat pirated copy of AC:Unity.  




 This has never happened to me! off all things that have happened to me no one has ever tried  to scam me on steam. where are these so called scammers? never encountered one at all.  




 I dont even want to watch it because i know it will just piss me off.  









 Whats the best flight simulator out right now? 




 uncharted games usually do end up looking just like the footage in the trailers.  









 And Oliver stayed dead. Would you guys still watch if Roy took over team arrow? 




 I just bought the crew and i cant even activate my key cause apparently the servers are down or their are connection issues. Is this happening for anyone else? 









 Seems to be a common trend these days. the first couple of months of the new year are usually the dumping ground for movies you would think would be better suited for directed to dvd releases. March has gotten better over the last couple of years with movies like the hunger games taking advantage of the less competition during that time but Jan-Feb continue to deliver nothing but crap. Any particular reason for this? 














 Just got back from seeing the battle of five armies. I need some time to digest what i saw but over all it was really good imo a fitting conclusion to the middle earth saga. 




 After what happened on yesterdays episode. This now opens the door to a civil war in the MCU with the rise of more Inhumans it gives a reason for stark to get nervous about people with special abilities and to start talking to the government about how to deal with these people. 









 Can anyone tell me what movies are still canon in the x-men timeline? 




 For instance mine are the james bond films i always tell my self ill re watch skyfall or quantum of solace this weekend but nope it never happens. Anyone else got a movie their like that with.  




 I feel like it doesnt really represent the tone of the film all to well i think they should of just cut it and started straight at the marvel logo followed by quills dancing scene as usual. would of been much better imo  



















 But this time have him direct it instead of Blomkamp. Surely Microsoft knows they have a good thing going here with Halo and that people actually want to see this made! the short films Blomkamp did for the halo 3 advertising campaign were amazing so if they could still get Blomkamp involved as producer along side Jackson it would be perfect. If you dont know what im talking about check this out. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejw3xpPIVbQ 




 I quite often see people complaining about this one. Anyone care to explain? 














 Cause they are too serious for Collin Firth's taste hehe.  




 So in just a few days the last hobbit movie finally releases which means Peter Jackson's middle Earth saga will be complete. The hobbit trilogy has had mixed reception compared to LOTR but thinking a head how will the trilogy go down in history? do you think more people might start to appreciate over time? or will people continue despise it? 




 Gonna buy the game tonight. Any one know where the cheapest place is to buy it? 









 Cause your cpu and gpu are running hotter than normal. God damn it. Time to invest in better cooling.  









 Havent played the game since release on pc so decided to try patch 1.3 and I must say even though there are still some bugs that need to be worked out like still being able to glitch in walls and swimming in mid air lol in terms of frame rate and just in general the ability to just play the game without stuttering its a huge improvement. Just thought id add my two cents. 

Specs of my rig. 

I7 4790
8GB RAM
GTX 660 2gb  




  i mean i thought this would be something that doesnt happen until further down the line like im talking the last season of the show or something, but it looks like they want to get it out of the way. Anyone else think its too soon? 














 I dont understand why so many people seem to struggle playing him. Just spam q, whats so difficult about that? 




 So It looks they are going the DOFP route and are going to reset everything in the terminator universe or at least some major events in the universe and then start fresh from when ever the franchise is reset to. Are we ok with this? what if they erase the first 2 movies and essentially make them pointless cause of the reset? 









 3DM said by the end of this week? any news? 














 Lets take the hobbit for example, i see nothing wrong with it. ive enjoyed it right from the start and i love what peter jackson has done with middle earth and yet people still complain about silly arguments like too much CGI or he ruined the movie by adding stuff that wasn't in the book. but its not just the hobbit where im seeing this. 

The new star wars trailer for instance everyone is complaining about something whether it be the damn light saber or the lense flare near the millennium falcon or the CG in the teaser, yes ive seen people complain about that to. UGH. what is it with people and why cant we just enjoy what we have been given am I missing something here? 




 it could be a lot worse even if its only from people who have been to press screening reviews. 

http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_hobbit_the_battle_of_the_five_armies/

 




 You know its going to piss of the batman fans.  














 I thought it was really good even though the premise is kind of stupid i enjoyed it for what it was and it actually kind of worked for me despite it being a silly diluted plot it was still an enjoyable flick imo.  









 What type of stories would you like to see made in to movies? The obvious one would be an origin of gollum movie since we only catch a glimpse of it in return of the king and hear little tid bits of it through dialog, i think gollum is interesting enough to carry his own movie. Also one issue i can see being a problem is what would be the end game for a MECU? since LOTR is essentially the end any movies would have to take place prior to LOTR. Unless they came up with their own stories on what happens after LOTR but I cant really see what working well. Any ideas? 





























 Made a poll since im curious to see which version is more popular. Also perhaps explain in the comments what made you swing towards that paticular version. For me it was alpha sapphire because it has lugia and i like lugia more than Ho-Oh :)

http://strawpoll.me/3101987 




 I just bought alpha sapphire of the eshop. How long should the download take? 




 If your a gamer then youll know 2014 has been kind of shit for gaming at least imo. So many big titles have been delayed till next year which got me wondering. Why dont we hear about movies getting delayed as much as games? I mean sure we had the amazing spiderman 3 delayed this year to 2018 and as far as i know thats the only one this year. Though to be fair i dont keep up with movie news as much as i do video game news so I may be wrong on that part but if someone could enlighten me as to why movie delays dont seem to be as common id be interested to hear the reason behind it.  




 Who else agrees? 

In case you need your memory refreshed. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqO5wlwQcRI 




 im interested in movies like The Prestige and Now you see me.  




 In todays day in age with the likes of itunes and netflix. I feel like we should be at a point now where if we wanted to we could pay the price of a movie ticket and get to watch the movie at home in private the same day its released at the movies but it hasnt happened yet. Im just curious why?  




 I think my game might have glitched because im pretty sure ive done everything right up until this point. At 5:18 in this walkthrough there is a door that opens so you can get to the second pulse generator https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ekz6R_m-SE but the thing is in my game the door is red and refuses to open. ive killed all the flood and covenant but it its not opening. Any ideas.  









 Id be willing to pay something ridiculous for an epic game like that. 




 There were rumors about him being involved in the film. Was that his voice? doing the whole "there has been an awakening" dialog? it sounds a hell of a lot like his smaug voice but slightly altered.  









 I feel like its an appropriate thing to do.  




 I sated in the other thread that I thought the dark knight was the boring one of the trilogy mostly because of the dry Harvey Dent plot with all the politics while begins and rises are great action films the dark knight seemed more like a political spy thriller rather than a straight up action movie like the other 2 and may have been why i found it boring. Anyone else agree? 




 That bit of marketing always confuses me and it makes no sense. I mean if they mean that it will be in cinemas exclusively for a while then sure but other wise to me it makes no sense when we know it will be on dvd and bluray and itunes and all that later on so whats the point? 




 Got my xbox one yesterday and ive got a few downloadable games that im currently downloading would like to check on their status when im out. Is there a way i can check on them when im not home? 




 Anyone know if this weeks ep will be the last for the year? most of the shows I watch have ended for their fall finale.  









 Im expecting a bunch of emotional character close ups, maybe one VFX shot and one last shot of something that will make the fans have a WTF moment to build hype for the next year. I heard the last shot of the trailer is meant to be the villain holding vaders helmet or something? 




 cant afford to go the movies tonight so ill be watching something at home on the internet. Ill watch pretty much watch anything except for horrors and romantic comedies. so fire away.  




 Why hasnt it been posted yet? 




 It sucks use Imgur instead.
