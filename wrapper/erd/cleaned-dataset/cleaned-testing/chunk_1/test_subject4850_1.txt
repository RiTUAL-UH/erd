 What's the funniest joke you know? 




 Hey guys, we're doing a charity today called Replay for Life!  All money donated goes straight to Relay for Life, an organization helping to fight cancer.  We're live streaming our games today, so feel free to check it out, spread the word, and donate, via www.replayforlife.org! 




 Hello Gabe, Wolpaw, EJ, Ido, and Coomer!  Glad to have you guys here!

I was wondering if you had any tips for wannabe game developers who only have coding experience.  While I can code a game fairly well, I don't know many people who can do the artwork, nor do I know many people who can do the music/sounds, and while I want to get into the industry, it's been a long struggle.  What tips would you have for either meeting people who can do so, or finding ways around it (preferably under a college-student budget)?

On another note, any internships available at Valve, and if so, could I have one? XD 














 I've gotta say, Github made their generator very creative lol 




 Hey guys, a quick compo idea I posted a few days ago.  If this is not the right subreddit please just let me know (not on here too often still), otherwise enjoy!

The name of this minicompo is The Github Name Game.  When you create a repository on Github, it generates a random project name as a suggestion.  The idea with this is to create an entire project based around whatever name you get (for example: I got duck-batman XD).  If you're interested, post the entry on my blog post below.  I'll try to keep an eye on this thread (or elsewhere if it get's moved).  No prizes or anything for this as of yet, but even if there are none, it's still a good resume booster I'd say!
