 RALLY THE CHAN! WAR IS COMING BROTHERS! Get 2chan on this too. 




 I meant to say humans lived with dinosaurs. 




   Seriously, I see it all the time. Every film with cavemen has them riding dinosaurs. In fact, 1 in 4 Americans think that Humans lived with Cavemen. 
  It's sad how anthropology is so misunderstood and underrated.
 




 What show is this? What episode? What program is that of which this poor fellow had to endure such trauma. 




 That was...that was...beautiful. 




 Will you be working with Chuck Norris? 




 Sounds cool. 









 Specifically ones in which the coding can be done from the iphone? 




 I have had difficulty finding a good game hacking subreddit. This subreddit pertains mainly to ethical and sometimes illegal hacking. So can someone direct me to a reddit about game hacking? 




 That is brilliant. 




 Specifically. 




 It's 2001: A Space Odyssey  




 Thank you, my good sir! 




 As in how did you create the flags? 




 How did you do this good sir? 




 Nice to be alone away from all the "EXTREEME HARDCORE PVP" 9 year olds, huh? 




 Why not have a nerd server for gmod?  
  It would be a sandbox server with one of those maps that have been multiplied in size by 4. 
  If we do decide to take my idea, all I ask is to be co-owner at least. 




 This is beyond fake. 




 It kinda reminds me how in real-life corporations evict people and tear down structures for their own mega highways.  




 How did the ender dragon attack? Did someone spawn it or what? 




 Is it due to the rules or because of the massive amounts of griefing sparked by Team AVO?

   1. Play nice. Try not to flame. Let admins defuse the situation.
  2. Don't post things that are retarded and unrelated.
  3. Post prehistoric content other than dinosaurs from time to time.
  4. No religious references. I have nothing against religion. I am quite fascinated by it. But "God/Allah did it 6000 years ago" doesn't satisfy our thirst for prehistoric knowledge.  




 Is that Tiny Tim? 




 He was merely upvoting a post. The arrowhead representing said upvote.

 Old minecraft. Especially the community. 2011-2012 was simply amazing because of minecraft. I remember during the winter it was thunder storming and windows were being smashed by hail, and I logged onto a server and I felt instantly comforted. 
R.I.P. Classic Minecraft 2011-2012 




 Because lel 




 I shed man tears 




 That's the movie I was originally thinking of! I couldn't remember the name. 









 Beautiful 




 Whose is the founding father of nerd.nu? Who is thee who stretches Reddit's empire to minecraft? Lol.
 Also, can I contact this person through reddit? 




 We've heard this story a hundred times. "Scientists discover new alien planet capable of supporting life!" People get hyped. No further research goes into the planet. The hype dies.   
  Anyone else remember Glise 581 from 2007? 




 They are planning something. As I said before, they are training on their server and talk of Ddos attacks and hacking an admin account are common. 









 Because, if you watched the videos I put links to, you'll see their massive numbers. Plus, that was only a small fraction of 4chan. Us Redditors have been a thorn in 4chans side, so some think they plan to launch a campaign. Plus they wouldn't stop at griefing, it would be followed by the hacking of admin accounts and Ddos attacks. 




 I meant nerd.nu

Look at that. I'd say the 4channers are Gods of pvp. They remind me of the Spartans. 

  So what happens if they raid c.nerd.nu? 
It has happened before. Reddit's official server has been raided by griefers originating from 4chan. We, as Redditors, are really a thorn in 4chan's side. So what happens when they come for the server of Reddit: c.nerd.nu?



 




 How did he do it? Can someone list the commands used please? 




 Can I give a minecraft item (A hoe, specifically) the ability to shoot guardian lasers? If yes, what command can I type in? Also, can I do this on my multiplayer server?
 




 Well, Reddit has had lots of enemies and has had a lot of flame wars. I think it's important to document these flame wars as they were crucial to the history of Reddit, especially the big flame wars which have effected the entire internet, like the feuds with 4chan. 




 What websites and organizations of people have really just been a thorn in Reddit's side? Ex. 4chan and Team Avo?
