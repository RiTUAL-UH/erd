 I can't imagine a worse possible team for a WR with "great raw skills, but a lot of learning and developing left to do." 




 I remember reading somewhere that square planned out IX, X and XI all at the same time. The idea was that IX was kindof a final tribute to the old days, X was like the "This is the direction Final fantasy is now heading in" and XI was their stab at the newly developing MMO market. Their goal was essentially to cover all the bases.

 I really doubt Cam Newton and (to a lesser extent) Andy Dalton are going to make huge jumps this year, just because they both played so well as rookies last year. But how about the other three quarterbacks drafted in the top-12?

Christian Ponder and Blaine Gabbert had miserably bad QB ratings, but they also were throwing to some of the worst receiving corps in the league, and behind some of the worst offensive lines. Jake Locker, obviously barely played at all. Do you think any of these guys will end up in the "pretty good" group of quarterbacks this year? 




 Yes yes yes yes yes to all of this, also:

This subreddit is for discussing developments in the law and jurisprudence. While posts may OCCASIONALLY seek advice about law school or careers, this is not a forum for soliciting or giving legal advice. 




 To be fair, despite what most armchair critics will say, the tax code NEEDS to be as complex as it is (for the most part), because taxation is a complex subject. The florida criminal code? Not quite so much.

  How is a dog sniff not a search? Because there's no reasonable expectation of privacy under that circumstance? Just because society/the Supremes have determined that the fruit of that police action is admissible - regardless of the reason - its still a search.

I saw you say that you're a criminal defense attorney, and I'm just a 2L fresh out of crim pro, so I certainly give deference to your opinion, but...

When we're talking about 4th amendment jurisprudence, the question of what a "search" is for this specific body of law involves an intrusion by a state actor upon a reasonable expectation of privacy. For the aforementioned reasons, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy that is being intruded, thus it is not a search.

Something closer to your hearsay example would be something like a *hot pursuit* exception. In that case it IS a search, but it's still "reasonable" and thus constitutional, but it is a search regardless.  




 It really isn't. When you wiretap you are listening in on a phone call, if it's done in a telephone booth or a home, then the courts have long recognized that there is a privacy interest that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. Because it intrudes upon that interest, it is now a search.

It's not a matter of what they use to intrude, it's a matter of what they're intruding upon. A dog sniff intrudes upon NOTHING except the fact that there are or aren't drugs in a suitcase. Nothing else about the inside of that suitcase is revealed. Protecting drug possession is not a legitimate interest. Therefore, it is not a search. A wiretap intrudes upon every conversation made over the tapped phone. The intrusion is much much greater because they're intruding upon all conversations made from private places. The courts have never had issue with whether or not there was a reasonable expectation of privacy in making phone calls. 

You should actually read *Katz* and *Place* and the the distinction will seem much more clear. 




 No, that is wrong. Look at [Katz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katz_v._United_States) and its progeny, there are factors that go into whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. Your second sentence doesn't even make sense because we're not questioning whether the search is "legal," we're questioning whether or not there is a search at all. 

A person needs a legitimate interest to have a reasonable expectation of privacy. In less eloquent terms: not having all of your belongings rummaged through by policemen is a legitimate privacy interest. 

The only piece of your privacy a dog sniff invades is to the fact that you are carrying drugs or not. The privacy of everything else about that bag is not intruded upon in any way. Because there is no legitimate  interest in drugs, and because the "sniff" does not intrude into the privacy of your briefcase in any other way, then it is not a search.

 America is one of the lowest first world countries in terms of effective tax rate for citizens, just barely above Russia. Hope that helps.  




 Nope. Florida is too far south for rednecks. Once you move south of the panhandle (i.e. the worst 10% of the state) there are no rednecks. 




 It's also worth pointing out that he suggests an effective tax rate to be imposed on corporations.

 The interesting part is that guys can (through their own efforts) reach most of the way to that goal, certainly enough to me a lot more datable. If a girl is ugly then she takes that to the grave.

 ITT: redditors don't understand taxes 




 The court has absolutely not done this. See [Ciraolo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_v._Ciraolo) where they confirmed flyovers where constitutional under the "plain view" doctrine on the theory that passengers flying overhead in a plane could see your backyard. There are a multiplicity of other examples where technology is permissible.  




 Tried posting in there. Got downvoted anyways :/ 




 I understand the trail you're going down, but I don't think it's the proper analysis to be asking. The standard enunciated in *Katz* is whether or not the privacy expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. 

Plain view has long held the standard of "no privacy expectation" because that a ridiculous limit on police powers (think; license plates, hair color etc.). This court hits a weird string with technology because now the police are gathering MOUNTAINS of data that, in pieces, would fall under the plain view exception. The policy the majority is pushing (That was originally stated, as dicta, in Kyllo) that the reasonable expectation is going to shrink as technology expands. But this feels like a stretch of the ruling Kyllo, because the logic isn't quite on point.

I really like this policy, but I don't like it as applied to GPS tracking devices, because this isn't question a question of a deeper intrusion into someone's privacy, but rather a much broader intrusion. And ultimately I don't think this summation of publicly discoverable information should rise to the reasonable expectation standard when taken as a whole.

Again, it's a minority opinion, and I definitely understand why most people disagree with me, but I don't think it's open and shut in either direction by any means. 




 No, the 4th amendment is a limit on the powers of government action, this has nothing to do with private citizens. 




 This is a constitutional limit placed on government powers... it's not like any agencies are just *exempt* from this. 




 I'll be in the deep minority here and kinda disagree with this one. 

Sotomayor notes that there is a privacy interest in the sum of ones public movements; which wouldn't be so if there was simply a tail on him for 28 days, and the Kyllo argument feels unconvincing because they're not gaining any insight (his location) through technology that isn't public at any given time (i.e. the infrared heat patterns of a home). It seems like a matter of police efficiency rather than a deeper invasion, and I just don't love the jurisprudence.

That said, having the court actually rule in favor of expanding the 4th amendment is a breath of fresh air, and I do like the policy they're keeping in mind with regards to technology and expanding police power in investigation, so I won't complain. 




 Okay.
 




 Irrelevant rebuttal is irrelevant.

Stay smart reddit. 




 Honestly in this economy, Florida's tax LLM should be crossed off the list as well. 




 I'm a Christian and I'm studying tax law, so I may know a thing or two about tax exempt entities. These pastors are not acting in affiliation with their churches, but as private individuals with their own right to free speech. There are no legitimate grounds for revoking their exempt status. 




 There honestly is nothing even remotely true about that sentence. 




 their wide receiving corps is one of the worst in the league; and it's still miles ahead of their secondary :/ 




 Maybe too late to be noticed but: debt incurred does not count against income, only interest accrued against you on the debt does. So worst case scenario if you're at 100k debt at 8% and none of it is subsidized you're looking at  -8k. 




 Wat. Dwight for the 10-11 season had *at least* a moderately more extensive set of offensive weapons to use. Did you not notice how his ppg went from 18.3 to 22.9 last year? 




 No, you could make an argument he was top-10 all time, but Jordan v. Hakeem is a non-argument.

edit: seriously reddit; if we're going to talk basketball give me a response if you disagree, don't just downvote me. 




 The absolute worst is when those smaller independent subreddits start using popular advice animals for jokes that concern the sub, and all the sudden they're back on your freaking front page.

 Not so my good friend. The NFL is only the organizing and ruling structure, it makes 0 profit, the profit goes to the independent teams each of which is its own corporation (of some form or another), and is taxed applicably. 




 I feel dumb, I can't figure out what's wrong with the first one :/ 




 Why would we need a disclaimer if we all understand implicitly that there's going to be a sales tax added in the first place? 




 Oh god. 




 What is that I don't even 




 Chicken sandwich, no pickles, +tomato, then manually apply one pack of chick fila sauce. Ask for an arnold palmer to drink. I worked there for 3 years and that was my favorite item.

Runner up meal: buy the tenders, ask for bbq and ranch, dip the tenders in both packets one at a time. Glorious.

One that was only open to employees: the maraschino cherries came in giant buckets and were in a cherry juice that was substantively grenadine. Chick fila goes heavy on the syrup for their soft drinks, so the soda fountain sprite + cherry juice made the best shirley temples I've ever had. 

Another thing I did (that isn't available to the public), was take the caramel packets that come with the catering fruit trays, and mix in a medium fruit cup thoroughly so it was like a candy soup. 

Okay, that was actually kindof gross. But it was awesome. 




  "When I was going to law school, and I sold my (Chevrolet) Corvair to make first-semester tuition and books for $330, a sizeable portion of the faculty had tenure."

Give me a fucking break. One great way to not be taken seriously is to give an anecdote about what law school was like in the 70's and compare it to today's students. 




 Meh, I feel like the only way we keep peace with r/atheism is to not give them anything to be mad about. In recent history this sub has turned a lot more to "poking fun," and I don't think it's inherently bad, but I'd rather keep the tension as low as possible.

 That gif spelled dammit wrong... 




 We've just about been "terrifyingly close [...] to complete totalitarian fascism" since the end of the reconstruction era.

The police force has been empirically much more professionalized ever since the Burger court's jurisprudence for criminal procedure and the Miranda warning waiver regime.

The government had much more free access to infringe on our civil liberties during the red scare of the 50's than it does now.

I'm really sorry about your friend, it's incredibly shitty what happened, but CowboyDan is right to point out that it's really not anything new in the broader sense of government power. 




 Can we not let this already-tired meme take over reddit? 




 Nope. Too far. 




 3,000/365 = 8.2 hours billed a day, combined with an hour lunch, 2 hours of nonbilled work, you're looking at about 11 hours a day. Throw in some other office inefficiencies, and that's 80 hours a week, 52 weeks a year.

Yikes.

 Ever since i've gone to college (and now grad school) 99.5% of the Christians I interact with don't believe in reformed view of predestination. 

Considering this is probably the single most frustrating topic between (Protestant) Christians, I'm just curious to see what the make up of r/Christianity is. 

I personally am a five-point Calvinist, thanks to the likes of R.C Sproul, John Piper, and a handful of other great writers, but it's not something I've ever been militant about in attitude.

 Reddit, I'm reposting this from the John Paulson loophole thread because I missed the boat aready

I'm not going to comment on whether or not this type of loophole should be closed, but I think understanding the system a little better could be help put into perspective why he's only paying 15% in taxes:

There are generally two main ways for the government to tax. 1. As personal income- we all understand that there are marginal rates etc. 2. Through a corporate double taxation- this means that the corporation will be taxed on its net income. But remember, corporations are merely a collection of people, the stockholders. So AFTER the corporation is taxed once, the government puts a 15% tax on the distribution of that money to it's owners.

for instance, hypothetically if the corporate rate is 35% and the capitol gains rate is 15%, that means for every dollar a corporation earns only 1(1 - .35)(1 - .15), or 55 cents actually makes it to the owner, so people who make money through corporations would be effectively taxed at 45%

REMEMBER THOUGH, employees (you guys) salaries are deducted from pretax net income, so the money the corporation makes that ends up in your pockets will only be taxed once, at most for 35%.

SO, when a man like John Paulson makes his income, it comes out of the AFTER TAX Net Income of the company, because his earnings are benchmarked by the after tax profits of the corporation, not the PRETAX Net Income of the company like most employees.

It may seem like John Paulson is scamming the government out of money he should be paying in taxes because of a loophole. But remember that the money that he made has already been taxed once at the corporate rate, so the amount of money in taxes that he's paying on his income is NOT the total % that the government has taxed.

That is all.
