 A Siren with a blink ability like mages in wow. I think that could be fun if it was on a low cool down or had the potential to be with her skill tree 




 ATHENAAAA :D PLSSSSSSSSSSS 




 Could you do a Commandant Steele one? :DDDDDDD 




 any chance your friend can dupe me a wep and shield??? 




 so you're saying there are more to come? 




 im on PC unfortunately :( 




 im on PC and i did them on a lower level character because a high level friend helped me with the prove yourself mission 




 i'm ok with the grind i just dunno how to get my hands on a modded wep and shield . 




 A word of warning this is one hell of a grind, there are 3 arenas to beat, each with 20 rounds and each taking about 2 hours to complete, it's not for the faint hearted 




 yeah sure lets go :D thanks ^^ 




 I decided to get back into BL1 recently and have decided to get all the achievements, just for fun, however my lvl 61 roland save file seems to be corrupt or something, long story short, i leveled a siren, im now level 50 and have lost the will to live.

 However to get the achievement for killing Craw im gonna need to be level 61 or have someone carry me, so i was wondering if there are any kind souls out there willing to carry a level 50 noob to help me get the achievement? :P

 he asked which bosses could be farmed rapidly. Not what loot they drop...

 What does RNG mean? 




 Exactly why i dont spec into anarchy. Also cos i love using my infinity WAY too much 




 i'd rather no teleporting at all, and you have to ride your mount everywhere and face the challenges a long the way, it'd make the game longer and more challenging as well as adding to the RPG elements of the game and taking less away from the immersion

 Mounts! Instead of the old catch a ride system i feel the ability to mount up at any time just like you can in WoW would be really awesome.

I feel like mounts like these could fit really well into the game and it offers more charater custimization if you give the player access to rare mount skins or just rare mounts etc.
