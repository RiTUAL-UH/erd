 I see your bad sweaters and raise you this: http://imgur.com/cJ3Sc 




 This is Jefferton's finest family. 




 Yes, it was staged. We decided to break free of tradition this year with Christmas pictures. To give a sense of before and after: http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/c0.0.403.403/p403x403/12607_447747458619863_115113246_n.jpg -- What fun it was walking around Kmart to get to their photo studio though. 









 oh, usually saw that. was sorta in my own world after reading this... tnx 






























































































 Wow--haven't really heard of anyone using Future Point's Starlight anywhere and I talk to quite a few end users. Going to have to do some research and see how they're approaching unstructured data. Just curious (hey, you said you were bored haha), other than the scaling limits you've hit with Starlight or is that all?  




 Hi, all I meant by vanilla was the raw open source distribution of Apache Hadoop but from what it sounds like that wouldn't be a good fit for you anyway due to some of the overhead and need to just hop in and experiment.  









 "You need to understand computation" ... thanks for that.

I am talking about cost and feasibility here, not possibility.  




 Let's you and me revisit this thread in a few years ;) 









 It's that we reaching the Brick Wall of Moore's Law. There are only so many transistors we can pack on a chip and with those comes some serious power/cooling overhead that negates (by far) any savings on the hardware. 




 Maybe, but maybe not. There's the Moore's Law issue I cited a moment ago, and the cost of powering a system like this expected to increase. It's not feasible for anyone to own one of these unless you're a research institution (like DOE Nat'l lab--not hospitals). It was a cunning play from IBM to show the applicability of HPC technologies in everyday settings but it's far from practical. Unfortunately too--imagine what would be possible with a HAL treating us! ;) 




 I am curious about what made you guys choose InfoSphere Streams over vanilla Hadoop (complexity, learning curve, functionality) when from what I can tell this is the same core Hadoop framwork (down to the HDFS)... Just when you get time, know you're looking for an answer but I'm just curious.  




 I think that Watson's role as an instant "second opinion" from a "doctor" is going to bode well for medicine in general. The issue is that only the most advanced research hospitals (who already have the most outstanding researchers/medical pros) will be able to afford a system like this. Right now the IBM System Z line is more than many universities can afford--getting it into actual hospitals is going to require some hurdling over Moore's law--if you can afford the hardware, the power and cooling for this puppy will kill you. Could be many thousands to run this each month. 









 And they said R couldn't scale. Bah! 




 Okay, fair enough. I like yours better. 



















 Perhaps Iceland should understand this issue and offer a more attractive option to conduct business there on site but as it is, it's pretty expensive to do anything. And besides, not sure anyone (even the most hermit-inclined sys admin) wouldn't be willing to move there. 


































 Yes, imagine that. Doesn't usually happen that way. 



















 Great quote... "data science is a very fuzzy term, but what seems to unite a lot of people is that is theyve come from a lot of different directions and ended up in the same place. It almost feels like this crossroads where a lot of different disciplines actually meet and share and exchange tools and techniques and talk and collaborate." 




 Thank you for rewriting SnapLogic's PR for the enjoyment of all, PanderDaily. :) 




 Mortar actually seems like a pretty interesting service. Hadoop as a service itself is going to be the next wave of services in general--all enabled by AWS (because who really uses any other cloud), I just wonder how the message about such companies is going to resonate with actual users. It's hard to wrap a "sell" around that, especially for those who've already dumped a lot of money/time into teaching a team Hadoop or getting hooked in with a distro vendor.
