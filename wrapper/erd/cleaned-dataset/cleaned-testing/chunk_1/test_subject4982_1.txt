 That is amazingly wonderful. In highschool I never had a boy friend and going to dances was always a thing us friends did in a huge group!!! GGG 




 This reminded me of my boyfriend, 9 years Army. The love of my life, lost. We will meet once again my love. 




 If you're worried about anything supernatural, I suggest having a couple cameras set up around the room. And watch carefully and thoroughly. 




 Would be mine too. 




 Lol fuck that, normally not one toget into this argument but IPhone is ass and yes, I am using one/own one. Worst phone I've ever owned. Dot cars for apple products in general was given to me. You don't just stop being blind because of apple lol 


P.S- extremelyintoxicated right now will regret this later 




 Congrats! Big step for him. But do not take his showing of no interest personally ever. Although it may be hard to deal with sometimes he will get there eventually. Each child goes at their own pace.


But again congrats! 




 Not an unpopular opinion. As a waitress/smoker and restaurantuer I cannot stand when people bring their children into our restaurant. 




 Beyond handsome. 




 Dope shirt in the bottom picture, how did you stumble into that?  




 I'm a bartender at two restaurants and nothing kills me more than this gluten free fad. I understand some people really cannot have gluten but the ones that can.....

My new response to people that ask what on our menu is gluten free I now tell them 'Sir/ma'am, anything that had a face.' 




 Whack 




 Microwave your spoon and catch your house on fire orrrrrrrr stick the spoon in hot water and not be a dumbass. 




 Because I had the luxury of being able to go on spring break and to play sports, granted I bought my first car and am still driving it to this day, but my parents had money when I was his age. My parents at this point both have jobs but at their age it's so difficult to find something like he had before making that amount of money. I wanted to help, I want my siblings to have a somewhat 'normal' life like I did. That's why I do what I do. It was my choice. I couldn't stand to see my family suffer anymore. 




 Without even trying 




 Amazing! 




 I grew up with those trees all down my street, I always thought they smelled like cod. 




 They typically form from ingrown hairs. 




 WTF SAME! Sylvania!  




 It is a cyst. I'm not an esthetician or anything but have gone numerous times to get those removed, I stopped going because I love popping things so I do it myself. I pierce the skin with a sewing needle after sanitizing it and it has to go through the layer of skin and the sack the cyst is in. It will hurt. Then squeeze. The process is a little painful and if your not grossed out easily I suggest you do it yourself. Sometimes they just explode when you least expect if so I do it myself so it doesn't happen at the wrong time. Hope that helped a little.  




 Fello oHIGHo tokerr, hence my user name. Wish we could blow down, that would make me one happy girl!  




 That's how you should be.  









 LOL 




 Calle Ciega is the name of the band.  




 Yes, I was in Venezuela visiting family and this guy had taken real interest in me. My cousin was freaking out, so excited that this guy was talking to me. Surprisingly he was very fluent in English and that made me really happy. We danced on the beach, had dinner and an amazing time. One thing led to another and we ended up sleeping with each other. The next day my cousin told me who he was. Turns out he was in what we here would call a 'boy band.' South Americas Backstreet Boys. Even though I didn't know it at the time afterwards I felt an odd sense of accomplishment. Like "I just did a celebrity." Never saw him again, but did download his album off iTunes.
