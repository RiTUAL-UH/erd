 There's a whole mass of people who do vlogs just about books and co, why not contact some of them? I'm sure they would love to help promote new writers. 




 That's half the battle =]

Though editing *is* harder. 




 You have to want it hard enough =] 




 I did very little yesterday: it made me want to do more today. After today, I'm feeling pretty awesome about myself, like I want to be this productive everyday! I would pick a productive week over an unproductive week anyday. I get more tired doing nothing. 




 Wrote over 1k words into my novel.

Finished a long over-due script for an indie game I'm working on.

Read nearly 80 pages of my book (The Silmarillion) 

And got to play some Xbox and spend time with my grandma.

How have you spent your sunday, CC'ers? 




 In order to produce a (just short of) 80k word novel. That is all you need to write. I know people who can spit out 1000 words in an afternoon. If you've ever been discouraged about writing, or how long it would take to write a novel. Bear that in mind. 

1500 words a week. 




 Yep, that's the issue. However at that length there shouldn't be any qualms cutting it in two. Better than removing 50k words of story. No problems or issues making it a two-parter. Just have to rewrite the middle into a semi-ending and then a beginning for the second half. Of course you should still cut. Any extraneous that needs to be cut *needs* to be cut. That's one of the most important things in editing. 




 That does sound interesting...I would probably read that. I don't see a lot of superhero novels.

Also, why 50k, yikes? 




 I live in England. Mother's day was months ago. Begone! 




 There was a moment when I could have got a book for free from Amazon. It had (finally) been delivered that morning, and later on I got a call saying that - to the best of their knowledge - the item hadn't turned up and I could get a refund. I hesitated, but told them the book had arrived. Also, it was a 20 book. I could'a got a 20 book for free. 




 Editing is the worst. And I thought writing a novel was difficult. Until I had to edit it.

Cut out 18k words. That was damn painful. Tell me about your novel =] 




 *The Amber Spyglass, by Philip Pullman*

And, *The Goblet of Fire, By Rowling*

I was thirteen when I read both of those. I think TGOF hadn't been out too long, it was before TOOTP came out. I don't quite remember the exact moment where I knew what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I just remember I read those two books at the exact right point in my life and from then on that's what I would do. I would write.

I also wrote a really short story when I was 7. I was with my two sisters and two cousins and they were drawing, but I couldn't draw, I hated it. So I wrote a story instead. I guess I was born to be a writer =] 




 My uncle - Crash Bandicoot on the PS1. I was so enamoured with that game I don't even know why. I can't remember the point where I thought *"This is the best thing I have ever seen in my short, little life."* I forsook my family while we were visiting my uncle just to play my cousins PS1. After that I had to have my own. It's been a sharp decline ever since. 




 Thanks. That book itself is actually kinda shit haha. But we learn from our mistakes. And thankyou =]  




 Will do. Let me just put it into the GDocs =] I'll PM you the link. 




 Personally I dislike prompts. They're never your own ideas, and they're never as good as anything you could come up with; if not by virtue of being purely *your own.*

Yes, I recommend loose planning. A solid direction to go with enough room for your characters to breathe. However, if your characters go off the rails, follow them, don't ever bring them back. Just follow it through. Eventually it will lead back to a major event. I introduced an entirely new character this way who didn't exist until the moment my other two characters stumbled across him - he just appeared to them and to me - and he was pivotal in the final scenes. It really changed the whole book and for the better just because he was in it. 




 There was actually a section, I wouldn't mind having someone read over (though it is in the very premature stages of an early first draft). If you're interested... 




 Is that the sort of stuff you write? 




 That is true. That's my motto:

*Progress for it's own sake.*

Thanks =] 




 I don't read Japanese novels I'm afraid. I did read The Buried Giant, by Ishigurio, but that doesn't really count does it? Though it was a decent read. 

But they aren't really those kind of spirits. I've tried my best to keep them separate so they are purely my own spirits and they adhere to the fictional rules of a fictional religion I have full control over. It's important to the story. And though I have in some cases constrained myself with my own rules, I need to know how they work, because I have to keep tabs on the effect they have on the characters. 

However, Japanese culture and spirits are something really interesting to me and I will look into those two authors, if you have recommendations... 




 Honestly, inspiration is almost wholly useless. If I'm not inspired at the beginning of a story I won't write it down. Inspiration will take me through maybe 3,000 words. I think in one case it got me to 8,000 before I lost interest in it. 

The trick is to write without inspiration or motivation - they're both too fickle to be trusted. Those few ideas you get, see them through to the end. If you don't get a lot of ideas, make the most of the ones you have. Push through them without inspiration. That's the best thing you can do. It's the only way to finish anything really. 




 Try writing something short. It's a really good skill to get the context of a situation in just that situation alone. If you want to write a certain scene that's more interesting to you, then do it. To conjure up smaller scenes and see if they can come together is basically how everything I write begins. This novel was three small ideas, and then I had a big idea and then I worked the smaller ideas into the big idea and brought them all together. That's just the second stage in the idea process. 

For my first novel I didn't organise. I had an idea of the major events and just drove my characters into those events. I didn't like planning because thinking up what happens next is much more exciting, because I know only as much as the characters do what happens. Because of that, and a lack of plan, the novel went off rails and finished at the 125k words mark. 

This novel I've planned out, though somewhat loosely, and allocated each part 30k words - 90k altogether, which is a much better place to stop a novel. To organise this I simply wrote down my ideas into a pad. I wrote a short story set in the same universe, revolving around the spirits, and a lot of the religion came from the ideas I got whilst writing that short and that religion was monumental in planning the novel. It was just back and forth a lot on a notepad. Filling in plot-holes, creating character arcs, looking at a wide overview and fixing any issues. Whilst trying to take the characters into the best, and most interesting, places. 




 No. But a fictional and extinct religion does exist in my book. It plays a super important part. And the rules that governed the religion (and therefore spirits) I had to set up before I could properly work out what happened in the book. Any time I made a step forward with the fictional religion was a huge break-through in the story.

But real religions, no. I wouldn't anything I wrote to be seen as an allegory or a message involving religion, that's not what I write about. 




 Thanks. That's the sort of thing I'm super relieved to hear. I had a huge moment of doubt a few weeks ago and lost *all* faith in not only the idea but my capabilities as a writer, and I nearly gave up writing for good. So it's great to hear that the idea (at least in it's basic form) isn't a terrible one. 




 Hey I do! Slowly. I've got a lot going on so progress on the book is super-slow . But I don't think, overall, it's going terribly. There's just a lot of distractions. 




 I've been wanting to write since I was 13. I finished my first novel...a year and a half ago? ( Ish :/ ). This book in particular was inspired by the worlds of Neil Gaiman, whose bibliography is built on worlds set in our own, but with something else inside of them that tends to remain secret. His books always feel like these worlds are bigger than they seem and we're only granted a small portion of it. 

But then I had my own ideas and my own situations and I brought them altogether and hopefully something good will come out of it. 




 In short, malevolent spirits. It shows the lives of a young boy and girl and how they are affected by, and deal with, the spirits at different times in their lives. 




 I'm starting to get bored and want to talk to someone about anything. Instigate a conversation I don't mind about what, you choose. 




 Mate I've got a degree in film and media. That ain't gunna stop me being published. 




 You have to leave

'Cause if you don't, dear

You'll never see the things you read about in books

You saw the films and you were hooked

But everything you want won't come to you

You realize now that you've gotta go see this through 




 It was all alphabetical by author's last name, but I bought about 15 books since I set up my bookshelf so now...I need to redo it. And because there's a lot of new books to put in it would probably be easier to take them all down and start again. *sad face*. 




 Writing my second novel. My sister is (should be) reading and editing the first in the hopes to get it sent to some agencies. In the meanwhile, my new novel is coming along very slowly. 




 I need to JDATE again before i read TBIFOS I think. Which means I might buy paperback - because I own JDATE on Kindle, which is a sin. I can't own a physica copy of a sequel and not its predecessor.  




 I have this same problem, it's such a bitch. And it makes deciding what to read next super hard. I try and maintain a system but nope. 




 But you don't want anyone reading your first draft. You want to make a manuscript as polished as possible before anyone reads it. Just so your feedback isn't just warning you about issues you could already have edited out; that renders the feedback wholly useless. There's different stages, and editing without any external influence is one of them, and followed immediately by getting someone else to read it.  

If you can convince someone to read your work and look at it the right way - an overall view rather than a view critical towards style, then you might be ok. 


 




 What I meant was it's all part of that saga. They're the three main middle-earth(/Beleriand) novels. 




 I ordered a book about three hours ago! =]

*The Cement Garden, by Ian Mcewan*. Coming from Waterstones, hopefully early next week.

I have a problem with buying books. I managed to get my backlog down to less than twenty, and now it's rocketed back up :(  




 It's really become an archetype now that we readers of high-fantasy (mostly) want long series. They prefer reading a longer book.

Publishers prefer series. They're more likely to gain momentum (and therefore money). It's a safe gamble that if a person likes the first book they will read the rest of the series. More money for publishers, more sales for authors.

Also the whole world-building thing everyone else mentioned. 

Mostly, I think, because scale and epicness can't be measured in a single novel, or two. Harry Potter uses all 6 books to lead us to the intense finale. Who hasn't enjoyed seeing Westeros unfold tale-by-individual-tale? 




 And The Hobbit ;) 




 I'm sorry if that came off harsh, it wasn't meant to. :/ I just read what I put, sorry if it came off wrong. It was meant to be helpful, it sounds harsh. 




 This just shows that you're writing normally, and, as mentioned, you are taking it seriously. If you weren't questioning yourself, and thinking you were doing badly, you wouldn't be writing properly. That's how it is. You're like me, like a lot of writers. You like having written, but you don't like writing. Your friends sound like they enjoy writing but fuck 'em, everyone writes differently. Everyone writes different things and to get different things out of it. It doesn't matter. Stop talking to them. You're writing and if you're not writing by yourself then you fail at it by default. Writing is inherently lonely, and I'm not saying that to sound angsty, I'm saying it because I know the best way to get anything is done is to not get distracted by, or involve, anyone else. 

No one expects your novel to be a grown up. It's a first draft, it is a baby. *Do not ever expect anything else*. You are not a good writer. You write for infants. And you **edit** your book into adulthood. First draft is gunna be crap. Second is only marginally better. I worked on my own novel for an entire year and went through more than ten drafts (I could have shot myself). Parts of it are unrecognizable from the original and that is such a good thing I can't even tell you. 

Writing isn't easy, you just gotta sit down and do it, take breaks if you want, though I'm sure you feel they are anti-productive and therefore undesirable. So just write, push through it. If it feels like you're writing shit, that's fine. If it's slightly better - but still shit - that's even more fine. It's gunna be shit until you edit it into oblivion. 




 Seems like your friend needs to read more. Read more and see how it's done. 




 The ability to self-evaluate can't be understated. Eventually you're going to want people to read it over and evaluate you work for you. Getting an opinion other than your own is above essential. The thing is a lot of your flaws you might work out naturally. A lot of your writing flaws you might edit out - and that's what editing is for. 

Like Stephen King said - "write with the door shut. Edit with the door open." 

My advice is to continue working until your manuscript is as perfect as you think it can be. Any weaknesses you feel are in it, address them as best you can. If you don't, any feedback will be just to tell you to fix things you could already have fixed, rather than any issues you actually have in your writing. 




 Here's the thing, if we advise you to do one, and you try and write it, but aren't convinced you wanna write *that one*, you won't write it.

Write all three. Bring them all together. The last two could stand as a single-plot on their own. If you make the society perhaps dystopic it's not too hard to put in some time-travel there as well.

I'm not going to give you ideas, that's cheating. If you want to write professionally idea generation is a massive part of that. It's not just the genesis of the idea or conjuring up the opening paragraphs. It's coming up with the entire novel and it's a skill that comes with practice.

Of course, if you're not writing professionally ignore my advice. Almost all of my advice tends to be geared towards people who write seriously, rather than just as a hobby.  




 *The cement garden*? Interesting title. Fucked up, you say? *researches* 

*Ian McEwan?!*

*Purchases*

Thanks, stranger =] 




 I have never seen Pacific Rim. *Sad face.* But I feel like all of these films are being held up to be something they're not. Sometimes I want my characters deep and well rounded, and their plot arcs to be beautifully intricate. Sometimes I wanna see a guy punching bad guys dressed up as a bat and growling. 




 Here's to hoping. Good luck with your audio/tech thing =] 




 A lot of people complained about Age of Ultron saying there wasn't enough characterisation, and their motivations were too thin and blah blah. I don't care about characters! I want to see demi-gods punch the living shit out of each other. Same with Jupiter Ascending (from what I saw), it just looked like a gorgeous film where a space-elf beats up people for a woman for who-cares-what-reason. 




 Yeah, my thing doesn't sound as bad as that. Not even by half. Kudos. 




 I heard different things about Jupiter Ascending. I don't think it even made it to cinema's in the UK. I'm sure it will appear out of the blue in the stores one day. 

I've heard good things about iZombie but I already have so many shows to watch, I can't bear to start a new one.  




 Any movie recommendations? I'm staring at my dvd's blankly. 




 Camera-operator for a live shopping channel. I can do it all, but I'm not as confident on one of the camera's, and it's just a *lot* of running around. Which doesn't help when you can't shout and have to stay ridiculously quiet. I've been looking at it from the bright side;*" the new guy can run the entire floor by himself after he's been here for only a few weeks."* 




 I feel you, being ditched by co-workers. But I work for a live TV channel (it's not as exciting as it sounds). So I had to manage three cameras and a trainee and run the floor by myself. I'm meant to be with two other people but nope, abandoned. 









 If you could, and were part of a band, what would you name it? 




 Hey guys, like I said. Any tips or things to bear in mind, or practices just to get better that you think would benefit me. I've been playing for a while, and my friend has given me a bit of instruction, but I'm pretty new, so anything is appreciated. Thanks. 




 I'm trying to write my novel, and need help procrastinating. I know it sounds anti-helpful but it's not. It's super useful.

So, just start a conversation, talk about anything! =] 














 You know. I've read LOTR, though a few years ago. Since then I've read a lot of what could be considered 'contemporary fantasy', and even though I absolutely adored them. Tolkien truly was the master. 




 I used to hate the idea of work. Of getting up and doing the same thing every day of every month of every year without cease. I used to hate it when people said they were looking forward to the weekend because it seemed like such a waste of a life to spend 5 days waiting for the other 2. I had respect for the nine-to-fivers, I never knew how they did it. 

I want to be a writer. But now I'm working my 9-5, mon-fri, and I'm one of those people who spend 5 days of the week waiting hopefully for the other two. 




 I'm actually quite nearly finished this. Overall it has been a very easy read. A decent book complimented by it's fairly short length. If it was any longer, I don't think I would enjoy it as much. It is compact, and that really works in its benefit. It isn't as heavy a book as I thought it would be, or maybe as the author intended it to be, but it has its moments. I've laughed, and some of the one-liners about humanity have hit me. I would recommend. 




 That is the question of my dinner tonight.

**Edit: I McDonald'ed** 




 What book, once you finished it, haunted you for weeks afterwards? Hit a chord so deep it never truly left?

Mine was "The Virgin Suicides" by Jeffrey Eugenides. I still think about that from time to time, it never left me. 




 We got in touch not that long ago, and we haven't seen much of each other. So it's really nice to get back in touch with an old friend I hadn't talked to in 6-7 years. But then he invited me to go rock climbing and, what the hell, I got out of a long term relationship not so long ago, I'm not doing anything with my life. So I'm getting to know him better and hopefully will meet some of the friends he's made. My ex got all our friends in the separation so it's definitely to get out and *meet some new people*.

Also, goddamn. My hands have been ripped to shreds, he had to buy some finger tape because it was so bad. I pretty much can't lift my arms, and I stumbled and had to crawl up the stairs. But I had such a good time. 




 Ever since I was quite young, about thirteen (possibly much younger), I've made a hot chocolate, snuggled up in bed and read my book. I'm in my mid-twenties now and I still do that whenever possible. That's my usual ritual.

What's yours? 




 Is really all it took to get over Writer's Block. To find that when I am finally called away that I've written a lot, and I don't want to stop, and I can carry on now for hours. Simple as.

Just something to bear in mind the next time you sit down, but maybe don't want to write just right this moment. 




 I've got about twenty books to read. And I'm doing the 52 books a year challenge, so I've got to pace my reading.

I've bought video games I haven't played, and some I've barely played.

I've got a novel to write.

I've also got to write part of a script for a video game I'm working on that was due a few weeks ago.

And shows I'd like to watch on Netflix (which don't take precedence but still)

And on top of this I work a steady 9-5.

Any ideas/suggestions for how to slug through all of that? How do you manage to be productive? 




 My dreams are fire.

That fire is the clarity of my

being, to show me more

than I could ever have been.  


I dream, oh how I have.  



And the rage, and the passion, and the

Heat, and tongues of that fire

Had licked my conscious desire;

And I knew that in that one, tiny

Infinitesimal, minute moment

I could be more than this.

And yet.

And yet.

Oh, but still

That it were possible to be all 

My dreams

Have foreseen.

And not this, 

Hollow

Impassioned

Being

Of caged-fire

And dewy eyed 

Desire

 Sure, I get up and I drive to work. And I pay a decent portion of my wages to keep my car going, and towards tax and rent.

But when I was a child I never ate ice-cream on my double bed, watching Netflix on my 50" TV. Being an adult...it really ain't that bad. 




 I'm just curious to hear your stories. How old were you? Did anything bring it on. Just though you'd give it a try? Or were you just touched by God spontaneously and thought 'I will write now'? 




 Or, generally, in your possession. The book you liked least and hated most.

Mine is probably *Under The Skin, by Michael Faber*. Did not like that book. 









 I'm tucked up in bed with my new book (The Buried Giant), and don't plan on moving, except for Sunday Lunch - and then it's straight back to my bed and book.

Anyone else got a similar day planned? 




 So apparently this guy is quite famous, I guess I was too young to remember him. So far though this book is amazing. Will be picking up *'Never Let Me Go'* very soon. 




 So. We are meeting again,

You. You who still haunt my

Every waking hour

To you I am to blame

For this shell I call home.

For whom I blame for this neglect, destitution.

I am a man.

I am a boy.

I am a human.

I am everything you

Should have known

You would leave me as.

You who are so bitter

So spiteful, you who would

Break skin for the malevolence,

For the colour; blood.

And unto me you left this

Learners scar, 

So you could be a poet.

I am a poet,

You are a fool.

You are a child, you are

The neglectful little malignance

That is the abode of my every whim,

You are the little malicious 

Greed that left me to thirst

As you fed this fire.

This pen wouldnt fit so 

Perfectly

In my teeth if you hadnt

Shown me how to hold it.

You are not a man

You are not a boy

You do not consider yourself human,


You are an object,

Arent you?

To which your derision is 

Well with no bottom.

They always seemed justified to treat you 

differently.

And you are the bitter 

Little worm,

As I am the bitter 

Little snake.

As you were so drowned in your self-pity.

I am still wet from your 

Macabre, oh-so philosophical 

Insights.

Shallow as a piss puddle

If you must.

The puppet on the strings

As you were,

But I see that not.

God I hate you,

I hate

I do not hate those scars

On your arm,

Not so much as

Your fathers disappointment,

But a lesson you taught

Yourself

Well.

How alive we are.

Just you and me.

I am the form you wish you had,

But having said that

There will be more poems

To come.

 Never really listened to any podcasts, but looking to get into some. Maybe just one that I can listen through if it's a decent one. I'm looking for some about literature or writing (in that vein), and am taking recommendations.

Note: I know nothing about podcasts.  




 It was a pleasure to read a book that felt like a throwback to the days of geniune dystopians: 1984, Brave New World, Fahrenheit-451. There was a moment when the government seemed infallible. Like being made pretty made sense, but was also humanely wrong; like the wars in 1984, the brainwashing in Brave New World. They were even setting it up like that. 

But then no, revolution it is. Same old contemporary YA bs. 

Too much to ask for a dystopian like the old classics? Come on, I'm sick of the underdog, one person throwing over an entire government? Sick of it now. 




 Is that I there is not enough time in a single life to read every book I will inevitably want to read. That I will die unsatisfied, knowing there was a myriad of books I had never gotten to read. 

Until then; **READ READ READ** 









 *(Probably spoilers ahead).*

Well, the entire trilogy. I don't see a lot of people talking about it and thought I would very much enjoy to meet people who liked it as much as me.

So, what are your thoughts on The His Dark Materials Trilogy? 




 Just an adventure story about a group of kids doing something unbelievable and awesome. COME ON! 




 Please don't hate me! Just the text get's hidden by that griever on the background, and I can't read a fair portion of text on my screen. It just blends into it. Please change it? =[

But also please don't hate me. *cowers* 




 How the majority of YA books have to have some reference to 'The Hunger Games'. Fuck off Hunger Games, those books were terrible. What was a fantastic YA trilogy? The Maze Runner. Let me just go over to my copy: *"A must for fans of the Hunger Games"*. The Hunger Games wishes it could be half as good as The Maze Runner. Westerfelds *Uglies*: *Before the Hunger Games there was...*. Because even a book published before THG still has to live up to it. 

So it's not so much the books as the covers. I just dislike that a book can't stand on it's own merits, it has to be likened to something else which is, in this case, **vastly inferior**.

(Yeah, ok, I really, **really** hated the last Hunger Games novel.)

But it's true with any trend. Any book that becomes popular others have to try and steal that glory. I just want good books to stand on their own merits and not have to attempt to steal the fame of others. It's cheap. 

I'm sure there are more examples but I can't think of 'em right now.

tl;dr: when book covers reference whichever series is the most famous right now. I hate it.

 




 Heard different things about this book. I gather from the reviews that it's like Marmite: you love it or hate it. There is no middle ground. 









 I loved the Virgin Suicides but haven't heard much about Middlesex, looking to get some insider knowledge on whether it's worth reading, or best to avoid. 




 It's a difficult thing spending four years on a novel and then, at the end of it, stepping back and realising it's probably, most likely, kinda, just a bit shit. 

It is my first novel, and I've spent about a year editing it, but no one else has actually read it, which I know is a huge flaw. But is it worth attempting to publish it if I feel this way. Traditionally publish I mean - sending it out to agencies to seek representation. Worth it just in case? Or not all, shove it in a drawer and forget about it?

I'm not scared of rejection, not at all. That isn't the case. If I decide to at least try, then rejections will just be a part of that, I accept that. It's more about how I feel towards the novel. 




 Why do you think Neil Gaiman's books are so popular?

His writing style? Content? Imagination? Worlds? What made him so astronomically popular, in your opinion?

And I do just mean his writing, not so much his Twitter or Sandman series. I just mean his novels and short story collections.

 




 Who doesn't love them some classical utopic-dystopia? 




 "With just a handful of men,

we'll start all over agai-"

*Damn it. Everytime!* 




 So I'm planning on starting a let's play soon. I can record output from consoles, and record film. What I can't do however is sync up video from a DSLR to video-game footage. Any hints about how to go about doing this?

Note: Recording from consoles, anything used to record from computer can't be used. I have software to record from console, but no way to use an external camera with it.

I don't want to use my webcam, because I have a HD DSLR I would rather use. 




 I've always shunned books on how to write. My thoughts on this have always been: "A book can't teach me how to write. The only way to get better at writing is by writing. And all the time I've spent reading, I could have spent actually writing."

But I'm starting to think otherwise. Is it ever worth reading a book teaching you how to write? If so, recommend some. I'm really considering it.

 




 [The Old Gods](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16OmmuY5uaQ-rlTq_HWMgLnbbooRE2UAnimgmCujKTD0 authuser=0)

New novel-in-progress. Looking for overall feedback, but also feedback on the style, and the consistency of the style, especially towards the end.

Thanks! 
:) 




 Honestly the damage isn't much greater than my cleaver, but it's a lot slower to swing. It is new, so is it something I have to stick with? or...
 




 Blood-Starved Beast (I was told not to put the name of the bosses in thread titles which sounds fair enough)

I found this guy much easier than Father Gascoigne. Don't know why. Only took me 4 goes, Gascoigne took me a day and a half. 

BUT

I was then so busy celebrating my character died of poisoning :(

 I spent two months planning out my entire second novel. And now I'm writing it, about 5k words in, so not a considerable amount, I'm wondering how good the idea is, or perhaps I just don't have faith in my abilities to execute it.
How do you have faith in an idea? Or in yourself? I don't want to waste all this time on an idea that *I'm* not even sure is too good, never mind someone else. 




 Finally defeated Father Gascoigne. Even though he slaughtered countless times (I spent all day on it yesterday) that was still *such* a good fight. So few games get me feeling so tense, sitting up nose to the screen, got his beast form to a slim amount of health, and so *close*. Got him in the end. First time I tried today. Obviously just needed a break.

Now - back to shitting myself exploring previous unexplored territory.
 




 Always throws me off - stupid question, I know. Do you always start speech with a capital letter, even if the speech occurs mid-sentence?
For example: *'Whatever you're afraid of,' she said, 'nothing will hurt you.'* 
That second half, "nothing will hurt you". Capital or no capital? 




 So I read somewhere Kirkhammer was awesome. I don't mind wasting the 3k souls. But, it really doesn't seem that great. Sword is too weak, and hammer is too slow. Did I make a bad investment or should I give it a chance? 




 I have 3k souls that I am super hopeful I can get back to Hunter's Dream. Hopeful, I know. I can either level up (to 20. The gun is more expensive than level) or purchase the pistol. I have the blunderbuss and it would be nice to have a pistol for 1v1, and a blunderbuss for crowd control. Thoughts? 




 Am I right in thinking the Hunter Garb is better than the Yarnham Hunter Garb? That's what I'm going with. Advise me :( 




 And you howl wildly and beat your chest with your fist like you've just speared a woolly mammoth single-handedly.

Oh...just me? 




 Just fighting against him is one of the best gaming experiences I have ever experienced. One of the most frantic and equal and beautifully-paced fights I have ever come across. He may have kicked my ass twice now, but I am actually really ok to die against him. It means I get to go back and do it all over again.

That, Ladies   Gentlemen, is why this game is so, so amazing. 




 My intention is to write a blog post - or, more likely, a series of blog posts - focusing on writer's block. Breaking it down, understanding what causes it, and, ultimately, how to solve it - in as much as that is possible.
I can only rely on my own closed opinion of writer's block to formulate theories, and that won't do. So I'm looking to crowd source opinions and get as much information from as many people as possible.
In general, just tell me about your experiences, but I also want to know what you think it is, how you suffer from it, how often, how it affects your work, and what you do to get over it? 




 So, I assumed that I would get one level per insight. I got insight when I was defeated by the cleric boss, and got two Madman Insight's from the Sewers. My insight level is at 3, does it go down? Am I missing something? It seems like I only need one insight and could infinitely level up from it (providing Blood Echoes)
