 Pete Campbell grows on you in the same way that Vegeta grows on you while watching Dragonball-Z. 




 They look like normal dirty pillows to me.

 If she was a White man who did this she would have been fired by now. That is all that anyone needs to know and the double standard shows you how the Left wing scum running the liberal arts institutions in America are taking over and they're winning because our media is garbage and won't call them out. News reports about this story aren't calling her out; they are merely reporting on the facts. When the media creates the narrative that people like this have been festering and taking over liberal arts departments in academia in the Western world for decades then I'll be satisfied.

 They should be kept out. Just because one kid in a video tugs at your heart strings doesn't mean we should accept any more third world immigrants into our Western countries. We accept enough immigrants as is.

 I have to say that I'm missing the British wit and banter that we all know and love here in /r/soccer.

 No way. Have Jeff Stelling and Chris Kamara on this. 

**SKY SPORTS NEWS LIVE COVERAGE: FIFA ON TRIAL**

Jeff Stelling: "We're going down to the courthouse now where Chris Kamara is courtside at football's trial of the century. Chris, what can you tell us about what is happening right now in the courtroom?"

Chris Kamara: "Well Jeff, you wouldn't have believed me a few years ago if I had told you that Sepp Blatter would be sitting in a federal court and sweating bullets. The scene here is truly as tense as it gets and there are certainly some squeaky bums in this courtroom today. Wait! Wait a minute, Jeff! They're bringing them out to read the verdict now. Just a minute. OH! UNBELIEVABLE, JEFF! GUILTY ON ALL COUNTS! BLATTER AND ALL THE OTHER DEFENDANTS FOUND GUILTY AS CHARGED HERE TODAY! INCREDIBLE SCENES!"
 




 [The thread in /r/CFB about Manti T'eo's fake girlfriend](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/16pi4a/deadspin_manti_teos_dead_girlfriend_the_most/) being exposed might be one of my favorite reddit threads of all-time. The hilarity contained within those comment threads was truly astonishing. This guy's comment from the thread sums it up perfectly. 

 This comment will undoubtedly get buried but I feel compelled to voice my opinion nonetheless.

Watching this story break and unfold over the last hour in this comments thread is what I love MOST about the Reddit experience. From the initial link, to the ensuing denial from ND fans and Te'o supporters, the speculation, the reaction .gifs, and then the real time links to ND's statement - I have never had quite such an intriguing social networking experience in my almost 20 years of using the internet.

All credit goes to DeadSpin for breaking the story but I'll always remember reading these comments in real time as the story was breaking as a truly unparalleled experience in the ever developing social network medium. 

 




 You're right. They're better at prosecuting.  




 Bro, do you even litigate? 









 I'll take "Things CNN and The New York Times Won't Talk About" for 400, Alex.  









 If you had a girlfriend I'd just put it in her fanny.
