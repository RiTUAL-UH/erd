 Deakins is a technical genius. 




 Cornetto Trilogy!!! 




 **DONALD GLOVER MOTHERFUCKER!** 




 Like I said, It's just an opinion. 




 YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA! 




 It's comments like that that will earn you a few downvotes. 




 You just spoke about the cinematography of that film, and you didn't mention Emmanuel Lubezki? 




 They should've called this 'Patrick Bateman finds a soul'. 




 Prometheus..? 




 [My Reaction](http://giphy.com/gifs/smiling-watching-12A3hKKsewxtGE/fullscreen) 




 I liked the first one more, second one was....abysmal.  




 all fixed, sorry about that :) 




 If you judge the movie purely as a movie, It is very well made. I haven't seen anyone HATE on it, of course like any war movie it will cause some controversy (remember when The Hurt Locker came out?).
But I really don't really care about the controversy, because I always remember this: It's just a movie!!!!

(Please don't downvote, It's just an opinion) 




 Just thought I would ask /r/movies what there guilty pleasure movie(s) is/are. Mine would probably be Spiderman 3, Machete, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Con Air. Just leave yours in the comments! :)

Edit: Wow thanks for the comments, I never expected this many. But why I am I getting downvoted? :/ 




 keep watching!!!! 




 Maybe not 




 I've only cried in three films. Those are:

* Titanic
* King Kong (2005)
* Big Hero 6

I Know Right!
 




 I've been looking for this! Thanks so much!!!! 




 Just wanted to ask /r/movies what everyone thinks of The Reader, a 2008 film starring Kate Winslet, David Kross and Ralph Fiennes.

Wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reader_%282008_film%29

I think this is an incredible film with powerful and convincing performances from all three leads, this film is certainly not for everyone and it raised quite the controversy when it was released but nonetheless critics and people I know really liked this film. So yeah I just wanted to know what people thought of it, please leave your thoughts and opinion(s) in the comments. :) 




 Yeah that wasn't bad either. 




 "The chainsaw rises" is actually a fucking awesome title. No shit. 




 Am I the only one that thinks the 2004 remake was actaully pretty decent? (Please don't down vote, it's just an opinion). 









 Just wish this post was a little bigger so we get could more interpretations and opinions but thanks anyway!  




 The quote in my opinion may be referring to Riggan Thomson, take it with whatever weight you want but I think it does. 




 At the beginning of the film where the drums play away the letters and start to reveal the title of the film it pauses briefly and across the screen you can see the word 'Amor'. Amor, as it turns out, is the ancient Roman God of love (aka Cupid) Amor is also Latin for 'Love'. I did more research and as it turns out Amor is winged and is often depicted as being blind or blindfolded. Now you must also consider the name of the play that the plot (sort of) revolves around. And know a quote from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Nights Dream:

Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
Nor hath love's mind of any judgement taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.
And therefore is love said to be a child
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.

IMHO this quote is referring to Riggan Thomson (or is it the other way round?) The director and writer, Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu, is not directly linking Riggan to Amor (or Cupid) but simply a homage or tip of the hat. As the title of this post suggests I may be onto something here and if I am then I am no where near fully understanding this reference. I thought I might share this with you guys and perhaps discuss even further. :) 




 In the beginning of the film where the drums reveal the title, it says "amor" very briefly. Amor is latin for 'love', and also Amor is the ancient roman god of love. so you might be onto something. 




 That rape scene was gratuitous or was is supposed to be?  




 If you are genuinely interested in his work, I **highly** recommend the documentary 'A Life in Pictures' it is one of my favorite documentaries and I guarantee you will respect this man a whole lot more after watching it.  




 Thanks for all the downvotes! 




 Hmmmm.....Black Swan...Mila Kunis...and Natalie Portman....I LIKED that movie. 




 It's one of those comment threads where the comments just keep getting funnier as you scroll down. 




 Very well said, you've made a solid point. 




 Roger Ebert gave it 4/4 stars. What's up with that? 




 Zac's character in the film represents reality. 




 Hahahaha, honest to god. 









 Here you are! Well..not exactly.
I suggest you look through these until you find the one you are looking for, hope this helped!
http://screenmusings.org/movie/blu-ray/The-Cell/ 




 We should just clear this up: They shouldn't have remade the movie in the first place. 




 I loved the Neo-Noir element to the nightclub scene, or to the whole movie itself. I hope they keep that up in the sequel. 




 PG-13? Pffft 




 Or not. 




 hahaha this actually made me crack up :D (not being sarcastic) 




 Why did some people not like Watchmen? I really liked it.
(please don't down-vote me guys, it's just an opinion :)) 




 happy? 




 It must get pretty hot under that helmet. 




 Sicario may have a chance... 




 How does he notice the things he notices in film. How indeed. 




 D: 




 *Nightcrawler 




 Into the Wild.
I want to do what he does. 




 We'll see 




 This film will be epic. Lubezki will be at the top of his game, as will Irritu. 




 Do you have any idea who it's directed by? 




 Tom Hardy stealing the movie?? Did you even look at Leo in that photo? 




 Sneaky Little Fucker ain't he. 




 I have read the book, and my Stephen King collection is quite expansive. All I was saying is that I learned that he was nominated for a Razzie, I didn't know that before, but know I do. 









 Now that would just be GIVING it away. 




 Maybe his new film 'The Visit' is good. But then again, maybe not. 




 Everybody in the German army has heard of **Hugo Stiglitz**  




 This album reflects humanity. The good. The bad. And the ambiguity of it. Most of this album is actually a continuous song. Most of it. The songs within this album evoke mostly dark emotions, but they are very relaxing. The lyrics of these songs deal with some very heavy themes. Mostly, like I said, to do with humanity; society. But the themes and ideas displayed in this album is familiar territory for this band. They are certainly not for everyone, they are for me and hopefully for you, too.

[Masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW5iwy69O1U) 




 Yes! But Oh Well, he was nominated for an academy award. 




 Anything Roger Deakins. 




 Just a question but does Micheal Corleone become worse in Part 2? I haven't seen it but I'm just asking. 




 No country for old men is not on the list. COME ON! 




 Christian Bale. He's been in two movies that start with 'American' and he's british! 




 I laughed so hard at that. Holy Shit. 




 Aaron Sorkin...That guy knows how to write a screenplay alright! 




 Hahaha yeah he does, maybe it's just the photoshop. I've seen him with it before though 




 Was the movie any good? 




 shiit. I'll edit it out. 




 Can some of you help me out with this post? It would be very very much appreciated!
http://redd.it/2u1zle 









 Ah that one, I got ya. 




 [Karma Gained.](http://guides.gamepressure.com/fallout3brokensteel/gfx/word/239275203.jpg) 




 The 57' one? 




 That's exactly what I'm looking for, Thank you. 




 Yeah pretty much any movie that's really heavy going in its subject matter or that just deal with some real heavy and dense themes, just mention em' here. Thanks! 




 He had a serious drug and alcohol problem. They can make the film interesting with that alone. With much character building, good actors, a consistent tone and a solid script, they could pull it off. 




 What we do in the shadows was pretty good. 




 Nah dude. Zodiac, now that's the real "Wow". 




 It is so disappointing that I have to scroll past comments and see racism about a fucking movie. 




 yeah the bad guys could've been better 




 End of Watch was fantastic. Come on dude. 




 **AMEN** 




 **KEEP IT THAT WAY** 




 Then go back into hibernation until Infinity War parts 1   2? 




 As Borat would say: Very Nice! 




 he used a revolver... 




 I genuinely think they are very underrated? Why don't you like them? 




 Who's joking with what? 




 Yes 




 Jarhead   American Beauty 




 That's because of his character, same reason why his character in Nightcrawler hardly blinks. 




 Jake Gyllenhaal hardly blinks in Nightcrawler (2014) 




 Oh Hi Mark! 




 Watch Foxcatcher. 




 Explain Foxcatcher? 




 Haha Lol you're getting down-voted. That's almost as funny as Channing Tatum in Jump street. Also, if he has '"flubbed" every role, explain Foxcatcher? 




 What 




 Yes of course. It's ultimately a character study. 




 It's a slow, tension-building film. Everyone needs to know that before going into this film. 




 Ahhh 




 I have no doubt about it 




 Whats happening...how can you read the script? 




 Someone watched an Honest Trailer. 




 Not yet! But I have ordered the bluray of it. Something tells me it will top John Wick. 




 A revenge tale starring Leonardo DiCaprio directed by Irritu with cinematography by Lubezki and co-starring Tom Hardy? 


JUST TAKE MY MONEY AND GIVE ME THOSE DAMN TICKETS!! 




 Nic Cage is playing an 'ordinary guy'? What is this? 




 Best action scene of 2014, hands down. 




 Doesn't work for me GODDAMMIT 




 Was just going to say that. 




 Dude have you seen True Detective? 




 The desolation of Smaug, the ending was so bad it even ruined the start of BOTFA for me. 




 This is shaping up to be my most anticipated movie of the next 5 years. 




 They won't put that in. 




 The title to this made me lose my shit. 




 Why did Nick choose to stay with Amy? I am completely stumped on this, can someone please help. 




 Bland? That's his character, read the fucking book. 




 Come on people where is Prisoners! 




 Always good to see a fellow Fincher lover. If you haven't seen Zodiac, I couldn't recommend it high enough. 




 Can't go wrong with Zodiac! 




 I got it from Sanity, in Australia. 









 As a fellow Aussie, did you get those at JB? 




 Ah. 




 Can't go wrong with Zodiac! 









 Anyone who is complex, has depth and is perhaps a bit of an anti-hero, please mention them here. 




 The book that is seen on his bedside table, can someone tell me what it is if they saw the title or just happen to know the book? 




 What makes a movie very well directed, what makes a director good or bad? 




 Please mention any movies that have really underrated cinematography and why you recommend them, thanks! 




 A dishonored sequel is definitely in the works or it has already been made. Just wondering what is everyone's thoughts and opinions, also what do and don't you want in this sequel? 




 Please submit your top 10 favorite movies here, I would like to see what I'm missing out on. Here's mine, no order (because it's impossible):

American Beauty,
No Country For Old Men,
Jarhead,
Drive,
