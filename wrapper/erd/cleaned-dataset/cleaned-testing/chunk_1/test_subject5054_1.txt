 I would think the opposite as soft boiled are generally 'softer', also main concern was the egg white not being strong enough and just breaking when you press.  




 No offense but I'm sure the people who are working on this are a tad bit more knowledgeable than you.  Yeah, obviously there are hurtles, if there weren't any it would be imminent and not 10 years down the road (projected). You people always pop up, "well... established knowledge dictates that this is impossible, therefore any advancement is not possible." Or maybe you're not one of those.  




 So you don't know? 




 Stupid tax. I can understand an old trusting grandma falling for this but like, how do you get suckered into buying something from some random person who pulled up next to you and who wont let you even view the product? I'm a pretty trusting person but errp 




 Do you know if this works with soft boiled? 




 I'll just stick to strutin'. 




 I really don't enjoy riding a bike in Houston. It's fine in neighborhoods and less busy side streets but I just feel extremely vulnerable on a bike with cars (driven by Houstonians) approaching from my blind spot (see: I don't have eyes in the back of my head). I walk anywhere 2 miles or less (walking is under valued in today's society) and taxi anything between 2 and 5 miles, which covers most of my territory.  




 Do those bigger buses have wifi? That's one thing I wish the normal buses had. Netflix just eats at my data cap too quick when I'm not on wifi.  




 I fucking love the light rail. Instead of driving to work, I started commuting via bus and rail. Takes a bit longer (30 mins in morning up from 15-20, 45 in the afternoon up from 30) but god damn are my stress levels way way down. I don't call grandma a cunt for driving too slow or get stressed out when I miss a light. It seriously has improved my life in many ways. I'd recommend it for anyone who can, and hope that with the current surge of centralized population growth, the demand and need will be in place for valuable expansion.

Having a car is nice, not relying on a car is much nicer.  




 I can't forgive you. 




 Was talking about the first player mentioned, Reggie Bush - played for USC. It's the white and red #5 jersey on the left.
 




 I'm worried about how little ass I'll have after seeing him in 5 days.  




 I'll be seeing him at Coachella this weekend! Can't fucking wait. 
 









 People who like college sports? I dunno. 




 Maybe in college, which the jersey is from. 




 No they don't. I get them on average within 10-15 minutes on the weekends. Have never waited an hour. Montrose/Heights/Midtown area. 




 The difference between Mario Williams and Clowney, is that Mario Williams didn't have the best defensive lineman in the league taking pressure off of him in his first season. 




 It's pretty irrelevant man. They're the 16th best team in a 16 team playoff. 




 "Huge playoff push" - yeah, for the 8th seed in the East. They're one and done in the playoffs. That's pretty irrelevant. 




 Well this was an imgur album which didn't have your blog accompanying it. Just going through the pictures in the album, all you get is the burger name and the episode it's from. 




 Funny. The two highest payrolls in the NBA this season are irrelevant teams in the worst of the two confrences. 4th highest payroll has the 6th worst record in the league.

 FYI the cabs have about an hour+ wait on weekends.

No they don't. 




 Where in your source does it say that Chick Fil A tried to have all the gays in Uganda executed?
 




 It was actually a law passed before the rise of childhood obesity in America. And it really has nothing to do with Kinder eggs, it was a law designed to ban the use of non-food stuffs inside of food products, pretty sure less to do with choking hazard and more to do with contamination. 




 So in the last picture with the tacos, it looks like you have uncooked sausage or hamburger in there? What is that? 




 hello? 




 How would they get across the Atlantic? Their combined naval force is dwarfed by the US' and their combined air force even more so. 




 Two dozen other countries that still are dwarfed by the military capabilities of the United States. Good luck getting across the Atlantic with the rest of NATO's airforce and navy. 




 Pretty fucking ignorant about the fact yeah.  




 Salters gonna salt. 




 I think eventually Light Rail will replace the HOV lane with an actual HOV. 




 Gotta walk before you can walk faster. 




 Salty 




 At CC..? With a scholarship..? 




 Hope our impending series is as entertaining as the last time we met in the playoffs! 




 I know you know I was just letting everyone else know. Ya know? 




 Your analogy might be good if these companies didn't actually pay fines. But let's make up our own reddit-reality and live there instead.  




 It's unrealistic. Human error alone makes it unrealistic. Add in environmental elements and yeah. You're being unreasonable and frankly pretty ignorant. But enjoy driving to work today. You're definitely not part of the "problem" you see.  




 Reddit: oh another thing for us to sound fucking retarded over? 




 So many disillusioned and uninformed people in this thread. Wow, 1,600 gallons...that's like an Olympic sized swimming pool! No...one of those has 660,000 gallons of water.  




 You're unintelligent.  




 Or 1/5 of an oil tanker used to fill up gas stations.  




 It's not even big. 




 Olympic sized swimming pool has 660000 gallons of water on average. 




 So stop supporting them with your business? 




 A 




 Why can't you?  




 Dwight is like 6' 9.5" 




 or throw some glasses on him and he looks like a nerd.

hey wait a minute 




 God damnit. Just when I went and got all fit n shit. 




 That's because Clutchfans is full of fucking morons. The message board is wack, only go there for Clutch write-ups and during trade rumor season. 




 He's a well known, super-volume poster on the site.

haha, he is definitely super-volume, if you get my drift.

always liked what he had to say though. 




 There are DOZENS of us! 




 In my shoddy attempt at defense, I was drunk last night when I made that comment.

What my mother hears: "Spouting racist rhetoric while inviting murder"

:D 




 My mum was convinced I *would* get raped *just because I moved to NYC*. Not for going out and partying every night, but for living in a city.

While I agree that is valid for a parent to worry about their child's safety, I think it's outlandish to be convinced that you would get raped just because you moved to NYC. That's pretty outlandish, no? Just as a numbers game, the rate of rape per 100,000 people in NYC is 14, while the rate of rape per 100,000 in the US as a whole is almost twice that at 26.9. As far as cities go, NYC is one of the (if not the?) safest, at least in the US. So while it might be *less safe* than where you originate (I'm picturing the town from Hot Fuzz), it's not like you're living in Cairo or Mumbai. If that were the case, I don't think it would be quite so outlandish.

So yeah, we agree, moms worry, it's not wrong for them to worry, I just think the comment I quoted was outlandish.

People worry about a lot of outlandish things, it doesn't mean they're wrong, it just means they worry about unlikely scenarios which they have no control over.
 




 You too pal, you too. 




 If you can't afford a new phone, don't be an irresponsible drunk and lose it.

Good point! Wow, such generalized insight!

That's pretty much the whole point of a bar. Though it is possible to go to one *and not get smashed*, *the odds of that are pretty slim*. 

Smells like you have an alcohol problem.

 I don't think you know what "irresponsible"

I think it's irresponsible for you to assume that someone with a fairly obvious grasp of the English language doesn't know what a basic word like irresponsible means.
