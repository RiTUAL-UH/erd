 Typical liberal comment: criticize the messenger but never get around to dispute the article with facts.

FAIL

 




 Let's stop the misdirection and answer with a straight up yes or no:

Do you support laws and procedures that allow any eligible voter to vote while ALSO preventing ineligible voters from voting?

 




 Do you have any proof that these pics are of Tea Party rallies? I have a pic below that was taken at an occupy rally. Racist?

http://i.imgur.com/Rq8tHLZ.jpg 




 Unfortunately, until our election process changes, you can't have both.

Why is that?

Unless you accept and support allowing only eligible voters to vote then you do not care about fair elections and only seek an advantage for the Left. At least be honest that you are only for laws that help get Democrats elected.  




 The Tea Party is not racist whatsoever.  




 You are evading and have proven my point that the Left is not interested in fair elections.  




 All I want is only eligible people voting. No one is turned away who is eligible and no one is allowed who is not eligible. We must have both elements. 




 Let's see if you are serious about fair elections. Do you support a law that both ensures EVERY eligible voter can vote and that prevents EVERY ineligible voter from voting? 




 Allowing votes from the disqualified, multiple votes from the same person, and fraudulent voting are just as bad a problem. 

We need to ensure that ALL qualified people can vote and ALL fraudulent voting is stopped.

Do you agree?

 Sorry but you are confused. Anti Tea party and anti Fox News? Yup, you are a Democrat 




 The Tea Party supports three policies: 1. lower taxes, 2. smaller government, 3. less government regulation.

How are any of these policies extreme or far right? 




 You called the Tea Party extremist. You are either a Leftist or you are politically naive.  




 Interesting how the Left can never even have a simply political discussion without getting angry. It seems as if the Left is more of a religious movement than a political one. Any dissent will not be tolerated and will be met with anger.   




  the Tea Party, but they're extremist,

You are losing credibility fast my friend.  




 It is only anti Left. It is not a hate site. I bet you think the Tea Party is a hate group also... 




 What is progressivism progressing to? What is their endgame? Progressivism is certainly  not some general desire to improve the country and society. Progressivism  is the endless march towards strict Leftist ideology. Ultimately progressivism will end gun ownership by private citizens.

 It is no more a cesspool than what is seen on Reddit comments. I find it truly fascinating at the worldview and grasp of reality of the Left and the Right. It is as if both sides are living in parallel universes and experiencing different realities. What that means is that one entire half of the US is either dumb, delusional, or in a cult like trance. 

It is scary that aside from politics, the very fabric of reality is disputed by the two sides.    




 Moonbattery.com is anti LIBERAL/PROGRESSIVE. It is not in any way racist, anti gay, anti education, hateful, disgusting, anti poor etc. Simply being against the Left does not equate to being racist and hateful.

 The box she checked stated that mere subjective belief that one was native American was not enough. One needed to be recognized by a tribe or have been on a tribal registry. She knew that she could not provide either yet she decided to check the box anyway. She did that on more than one occasion.

Am I wrong?

Well?

Crickets.... 




 Nice job (I mean it) but you are confusing the terms Conservative (capital C) and conservative (lower case C). The two are not the same.

This is also true with Liberals as opposed to liberals

The Tea Party are Conservatives who are interested in being conservative regarding giving power to the government. That does not mean they are conservative in all things social or science.

A Liberal is a Leftist. That is different from a small L liberal who is a person who favors government ensuring the rights of all. JFK was a liberal. Obama is a Liberal

 

 




 I'm a left-leaning moderate who favors socialistic systems over capitalistic.

Haven't we had enough socialist solutions? Didn't we learn anything from the Soviets? the Maoists? the Khmer Rouge? The Nazis? The Fascists? The Cubans? Those socialist solutions have resulted in the deaths of over 100 million people during the past century. 

You really idolize those murderous regimes?  




 No one has said that modern conservative parties make a platform on racism

Please explain why there is no dissent within the Left? What policies of the Democrats do you oppose? 




 You have failed to refute my points. Nice interpretation of American Values. Lol

Why would the Republicans embrace ANY policy that would:

1. Attract a tiny minority of voters (Voters for whom racism is at the very top of their requirements in a candidate)

2. Anger and offend the vast majority of the voting public?

It makes no logical sense to do so. Can you imagine a party adopting a policy of "We are the party of pedophiles"?

The Left has lied about Republicans and their alleged embrace of racism.

Without lies the Left has nothing 




 I have debated you and you seem more interested in being snarky than debate. Typical liberal avoidance  




 Maybe you should read the thread first? If you don't understand then ask an adult  




 Good article. Everyone should read it just to familiarize themselves with the claims on both sides (minus the snarkiness). Then they should think critically and decide on their own what to believe.  




 Political parties do evolve over time. 

What my point is is that Liberals like to view American politics as The Republican Party was "good" when Lincoln was president and the Democrats were less so. At some magical moment, the two parties switched and the Democrats became "good" and the Republicans decided to become evil and embrace racism.

Unfortunately the facts don't prove that wishful thinking.

Both parties have evolved over time. Both parties have embraced bigger government to various extents. Both have evolved in how they view the role of government.

There has never been a magical shift of the parties in terms of "good" and "bad" nor has there been a shift in the parties' overtly racist policies.

The Democrat Party refuted racism in the 60's and 70's. The Republicans never embraced racism as a policy. 

Got it? Any more smug snarky retorts? 




 Atwater said that the GOP offered the Southern Democrats a choice based on the GOP's position on traditional values. He expressly stated that the GOP did NOT have to attract the disaffected Democrats with appeals to racism.

There was no ideological shift.
  
That is not a "shift" in terms of the GOP embracing racism as the Democrats had done for 150 years prior.

The GOP never embraced racism. The Democrats simply stopped supporting overt racism in the 60's and 70's

 




 Wrong. I have read all of the links provided and commented on them. Several have been good in explaining various flows of each parties' evolving policies and positions.

What those links have failed to do is show a shift of racist policies from the Democrats to the GOP. The Democrats have historically been a party that embraced overt racism for over 150 years. It was only in the 60's and the 70's when the Democrats refuted overt racism. 

Simply because the Democrats refuted overt racism in the 60's and 70's does not mean that the GOP embraced racism as a political strategy.

 




 Provide facts. Your opinion and insults offer nothing 




 Thank you for the links. The Live Science was interesting as it explains a bit about how at the turn of the 20th century and into the FDR administration, both parties embraced bigger government. Certainly the rise of revolutionary Communism after WWI further motivated governments fearful of revolution, to expand government programs. 

The article does not explain a switching of racist attitudes (or the switching of party platforms) from the Democrats to the GOP as has been claimed in the comments of the post. 

Thank you also for the Hufpo article. It was informative and a good read.  That article showed how both parties evolved politically to match society's evolution regarding social issues during the turn of the 20th century. The article did a good job until it made a jump to the 60's and tried to connect the two periods as being a profound shift in which the Democrat Party refuted racism and the GOP embraced it. In that aspect the article failed. 

Interestingly, this article supports the recent evolution of the GOP that once supported bigger government being influenced by the Tea Party to reduce the size of government. Political parties eventually evolve with the will of the voters.  




 You claimed there was a shift and you failed to provide proof. Unless you provide proof, your opinions are just that 




  Its pretty common knowledge.

Your link only discusses Barry Goldwater's struggle within his own party. 

If your claim is true then there should be ample documentation of this so called switch. Please provide more than simply claim it's common knowledge














 




 Stop evading and provide evidence, proof, facts.... 




 You can't refute my facts and you are calling me stupid? 

I challenge YOU to refute my facts...

Well?

Crickets.........
 




 Did you even read that wikipedia section? It states that there was a migration of Democrat voters to the GOP over several decades. 

It does not say that there was a "shift" of  racist attitudes from the Democrats to the GOP. 

It does not say that the GOP embraced racism in order to attract racist Southern voters.  




 Uneducated Liberals claim such a shift but no such shift ever happened. The Left uses that claim to try and disguise their disgusting history of oppressive racism.

If someone wishes to dispute this fact then please provide facts, dates, people involved etc who orchestrated this so called "switch" 




 The Southern Strategy is often misunderstood. It is based on an interview decades ago by Republican Lee Atwater. 

In the interview, Atwater stated that the GOP could use economic issues to attract southern Democrat "Dixiecrat" voters who felt they were being abandoned by the Democrat Party's shift to the Left away from traditional American values. 

The interview featured him stating that the GOP could use economic issues not just racist appeals of "nigger nigger". This quote is often edited and claimed to prove that the GOP had a formal strategy of adopting overt racism in order to capture the votes of racist southerners.

If one listens to the interview, they will see that the claim of an embrace of racism by the GOP is not what Attwater is saying.

Demographic studies have shown that there was not a sudden shift of Dixiecrat voter away from the Democrat Party to the GOP after the Civil Rights acts of the 60's. The migration of Democrats to the GOP in the south has been a gradual movement over 30 years. This migration was due to a belief that the Democrat Party was abandoning them by moving to the Left politically and rejecting American values. It was not due to racism.

http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2013/04/the-southern-strategy-debunked-again.php

The logical question remains: why would a major political party  adopt a policy of racism given that voters for which racism is an important political issue is minute and the the number of voters who would be offended by such a policy is huge? 

In other words it is illogical for a political party intent on winning nation elections to embrace any position in which the benefits are tiny and the negatives are huge. 




 This is a common misconception. Can you provide any evidence of this switch?

 When she applied for the teaching positions in Texas and at Harvard she was asked about Native American heritage. The question of Native American heritage often comes up in employment. 

Because too many whites claim Indian heritage when they are really not Native American, the questionnaires she filled out qualified how that question could be answered.

The questionnaires stated that a subjective belief was not enough to claim Native American heritage. What was needed was acceptance or affiliation with a recognized Indian tribe.

She was not identified by any tribe as a member nor did she maintain any tribal affiliation yet she answered the employment question in the affirmative anyway. She lied

She also lied about her answer and tried to pull a cover up regarding the whole issue.

She lied and plagiarized several recipes in a book called "Powwow Chow" 

Her husband, also not an Indian, penned a recipe for that book and he also falsely claimed to be of Indian heritage.

 So you see, lying has been a regular aspect of her personality and of her lack of respect for rules

 




 What a nice collection of Leftist fables you have collected. 

A few notes: 

The Koch bros are not the running the GOP and have NO influence over the Tea Party. They are free to support any policies they wish but that has no bearing on how the Right votes.

What is an "anti atheist law". I am a Conservative and an atheist and I have never herd that term before.

There is no political will in this country to ban or seriously curtail abortions. That is a dead issue that the Left brings up to demonize the GOP.

 But she did lie about her Indian heritage in order to take an affirmative action position away from a real minority.

That has absolutely NOT been debunked. It is a fact 




 Socialism has failed everywhere it has been tried. Socialism has been responsible for the deaths of over 100 million people over the past century. 

It has never worked because inherent in socialism is the coercive and violent threat of government against anyone who resists their control. 

Socialism is an ideology. It is not an ala carte menu. It is a mindset, a philosophy that the "haves" are evil and must be sacrificed to the "have nots". Socialism is about exerting control over the population by a cadre of self proclaimed elites. 

I do not want any group of so called elites making decisions for me and bossing me around.

 Socialism is the step before communism. Socialism can operate parasitically in a Capitalistic system (to a certain extent) whereas Communism sweeps the old Capitalistic system aside. 




 That graph correlates with the rise in Leftist policies adopted by the US government. Thanks for making my point. 




 Communism is what comes after socialism has been established (in a capitalist state). Fascism is just another form of socialism featuring extreme nationalism and has nothing to do with Conservatism whatsoever.

This is basic poli sci 101 stuff.   




 The Scandinavian countries employ many socialistic policies but they are not true socialistic states.

Costs are much higher unless one is very poor and heavily subsidized.

Regarding affirmative action, I will often ask Liberals at what point should AA end? Invariably they always say "never".

The goal is not equality but rather keeping minorities controlled and dependent so that they vote as a block for Democrats.    




 Can you make a serious comment? What proof do you have that racism is a motivating factor to Conservatives? 




 As a Conservative, I am against ANY Liberal progressive socialist politician regardless of their race, creed, color, ethnicity, sex, age, sexual preference or any other qualifier. 

The claim  that Conservatives are racist is a strategic tool the Left uses to AVOID debating issues and solutions in a meaningful and productive way. By claiming racism, the debate ends, the issues remain undebated, and the Conservative is vilified as a bad person. 




 How can you even make that claim? Based on what? Dude, where did you pick up your crazy ideas? 




 The cognitive dissonance on the Left is truly fascinating.  Sort of like children plugging their ears with their fingers so they don't hear that which they dislike.  




 Moxy, I simply don't know why you are fighting this so hard. It is a proven fact that Hitler and Mussolini were devout socialists as were their respective Nazi and Fascist movements. 

We can trade comments til the cows come home but that won't change documented, undisputed, factual history. You simply can't deny it just because you wish it weren't so.  

Curious question:What level of education have you achieved? I am assuming a few college classes 




 You are obviously confused and lumping Marxism, socialism, Naziism etc into a polyglot of isms. Marxism IS a form of socialism as is Naziism but although they share many key points they also differ in important ways.

You really should study the history of socialism in Germany during the turn of the 20th century. It is a fascinating period in which many socialist philosophers explored various types of socialism in search of the best and most equitable form.

With that said, you make the mistake of confusing the meaning of "control over the means of production". That term incorporates actual ownership such as a nationalized industries, coercive control over industries, and it includes crony capitalism in which certain favored corporations are given exclusivity and non favored corporations are excluded.

Hitler was a devout socialist and not an opportunist that simply attached himself to the term. He wrote extensively on the virtues of socialism and  even founded what became the German Socialist Workers Party.

Please expand your scholarly investigations beyond wikipedia. The study of socialism is a fascinating and diverse exploration into human attempts at optimum organizational systems

 Nice post. Amazing how fast the roaches scurry for the shadows when a light is flicked on.  




 It's CNN. Go figure 




 

    The Nazis were against Capitalism.

No they were not - that is just an outright untruth.

Really? Let's look at the primary sources, the Program of the National Socialist German Workers Party (Nazi) itself: http://www.stephenhicks.org/2009/10/26/appendix-1-nsdap-party-program-nietzsche-and-the-nazis/

A few keys points of that program:

"Point 11 calls for the abolition of all income gained by loaning money at interest.

Point 12 demands the confiscation of all profits earned by German businesses during World War I.

Point 13 demands the nationalization of all corporations.

Point 14 demands profit-sharing in large industrial enterprises.

Point 15 demands the generous development of state-run old-age insurance.

Point 16 calls for the immediate socialization of the huge department stores. "



 And here is a quote from Adolf Hitler in a speech in 1927: We are socialists, we are enemies of todays capitalistic economic system for the exploitation of the economically weak, with its unfair salaries, with its unseemly evaluation of a human being according to wealth and property instead of responsibility and performance, and we are all determined to destroy this system under all conditions.

Here is a quote from Josef Goebbels: The worker in a capitalist stateand that is his deepest misfortuneis no longer a living human being, a creator, a maker. He has become a machine. A number, a cog in the machine without sense or understanding. He is alienated from what he produces.[

http://www.stephenhicks.org/2009/12/04/economic-socialism-not-capitalism-section-8-of-nietzsche-and-the-nazis/

These quotes were just what I googled in 10 seconds worth of research. 

Your claim that the Nazis were Capitalists or supported Capitalism is thus proven False. 




 I was being sarcastic. In my experience, people are much more forgiving of slights and insults when they are carrying. I assume it's because such challenges to one's manhood are not really challenges at all. Carrying gives them the power of life and death and it allows them to be a merciful god.  




 The Nazis were against Capitalism. They "controlled" not owned the means of production.

The Nazis were against the Communists because they viewed them as competitors. Hitler also felt that international Communism contained too many Jews as members. Communism was internationally focused while Naziism was more nationalistic. 

Denmark has some socialist policies but it is a different form of socialism than Naziism. Also the Nazis and the Fascists (both socialists) were distinct in that Fascism did not involve the extreme racism and  antisemitism of Naziism.

Naziism and Fascism are often incorrectly lumped together as the same system. They were not. The confusion results from the Soviets lumping the two systems together in propaganda during WWII.  




 Wikipedia it. Socialism includes several economic/political systems such as Communism, Naziism, Fascism, and even Anarcho Syndicalism etc.

Al have various distinctions but all include non private control over the means of production and a government centric society  




 The Nazis were socialists. The Tea Party is the opposite of socialism. School much? 




 12 but I still out debated you with ease.  




 I live the Tea Party while you merely hear snarky soundbites about it.

I think I will stay in the reality based  community rather than your community based reality. 




 The Tea Party is a grassroots organization with no central leadership or structure based on the ideas of 1.smaller government, 2. less taxes, and 3. less government regulation.  

The Left has created a weird false fantasy that we are just dupes of the Koch bros.  

That fantasy is 100% false. The Kochs support Conservative political views and that is fine by me. But they do not control the Tea Party in any way.

The recent midterm election tsunami proves that the political sands are shifting in a monumental way and the Kochs could not be the cause of it. 

 




 What a silly and untrue statement. I am a hardcore Tea Party Conservative and the Kochs have ZERO influence on my political views whatsoever. 

I am not just saying that to be argumentative or contrary. I am being totally honest here. The Kochs exert ZERO influence over the Tea Party and the Conservative wing of the GOP. 

I am very active in online and real life Conservative forums and I have NEVER heard of anyone even discussing the Koch bros.  




 Ooops! Didn't mean to touch a nerve.  At this point I should realize that to some, reddit is their only social outlet and that I have no business making light of that fact. No harm, no foul. Good luck 




 It just dawned on me...you truly have nothing better to do with your time than to argue about this silliness. 

What went wrong man? 




 My only point was that she only had 90 rounds of ammo for a mission that logic would dictate would require more (multiple hard targets). 

Now please tell everyone about how you are a Navy SEAL BUDS instructor and enthrall us with your tales of glory and daring do...  




 Let me get this straight, you are acting like you have sand in your vagina over a pic of a Navy sailor holding a handful of gummi bears? Dude, go outside, ride a bike, volunteer somewhere, interact with some live humans.... 




 So fast you'll be early for class yesterday 




 The most likely threats to a docked ship are below the surface, on the surface, and in the air. Not much she can do regarding underwater or aircraft threats. She is likely to have to deal with small boat attacks probably in numbers larger than one. It is highly unlikely that she will be able to deal with such a threat with 60 rounds of 5.56mm and 30 rounds of 9mm.

 




 What about hunting or target shooting? 




 That doesn't seem to be adequate. I imagine any asymmetric attack would involve multiple targets and require more than +/- 90 rounds to deal with. Sounds like politically correct bs at play... 




 Just concerned that if you had to deal with an asymmetric threat that you would have more than one or two mags.   




 Christie and Bush have zero support from the Tea Party. They both have zero chance of being nominated. Walker would be just what this country needs after 8 years of the Obama debacle  




 Where are your spare mags? Do they only give you one? 




 You should change your user name to Scarecrow because you've got the whole strawman thing down cold.  




 Possibly the greatest political philosopher in history.

 The best thing about Ashland KY is the fact that they have a bridge over the Ohio river into Ohio that allows you to buy beer on Sunday (Kentucky does not sell alcohol in stores on Sunday) 




 The oil and gas released from fracking is collected via a controlled tube. There are many shale and impermeable rock layers between the oil and gas and the surface and ground water. The fracking process only fracks a few layers leaving most layers intact. 

I understand your frustration and need to be snarky but is there a part of you who can simply discuss the factual realities of fracking?

Turn off the religious part of your brain and just weight the facts. 

A question for you:

If fracking methods and fossil fuel usage were technologically advanced to the point that we could guarantee that no environmental damage ever occurred, would you  accept fracking and the use of fossil fuels?  




 It's lubricants that allow the sand to pass within the cracks that the fracking pressure creates. Even if it's plutonium, at that depth (over 1-2 miles from the surface) the chemical is going to stay there. 

You obviously are arguing with feelings and not with science. The oil industry has been injecting all types of lubricants, oil, chemicals etc into deep disposal wells for a hundred years with no issues. Why is it so hard for you to grasp the science involved? 




  Speculation. We don't know what chemicals they use and in what amounts because they have fought and won to keep them secret.

No, we do know exactly what happens to those chemicals because deep well waste injections have been done for a hundred years. The chemicals and the water react with iron ore in the soil and transform into iron oxide, rust essentially. This is chemistry 101 stuff.

You are trying to bring your environmentalism, your religion, your philosophical aversion to fossil fuels into a scientific factual discussion. 

Unless you have divested your lifestyle from the benefits of fossil fuels then you are just not being a credible advocate. 

Note: I fully embrace the day when we can utilize totally clean energy. That is definitely our goal and or destiny. We simply need to allow the science to develop. Shooting ourselves in the foot by stopping  the use of fossil fuels prematurely is  philosophically satisfying but realistically naive and harmful.
